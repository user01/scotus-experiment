3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

4 argument next in Case No. 14449.

5             On the severance question, Mr. McAllister.

6          ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER

7               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8             MR. McALLISTER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may

9 it please the Court:

10             The joint sentencing proceeding in these

11 cases did not violate the Eighth Amendment because each

12 defendant received the individualized sentencing

13 determination to which he was entitled.

14             Each presented all of the mitigating

15 evidence he chose to produce.  The jury instructions

16 explicitly told the jury to consider each defendant

17 individually.  In fact, there were several separate

18 instructions, some that related only to one defendant or

19 only to another defendant.

20             Each  the jury for each defendant then had

21 to complete a specific verdict form, and this jury had

22 already proven its ability to distinguish between these

23 two defendants when it convicted one of some counts in

24 the original guilt phase, of which it acquitted the

25 other.

5 1             The only way the Kansas Supreme Court gets 2 to an Eighth Amendment error in this case  well, 3 really, there are two points.  One, it relied upon 4 possible, and one instance not even, violations or 5 errors of State law to find a prejudice that  that 6 rose to an Eighth Amendment level.  And two, it 7 disregarded altogether, with really no explanation, the 8 longstanding foundational principle that juries are 9 presumed to follow their instructions. 10             The two State law errors, arguably, that  11 the Kansas Supreme Court found, one was the admission of 12 evidence of the sister who made the comment about 13 Reginald may have told me he shot those people. 14             Well, that's not even an error of State law. 15 They said basically that's prejudicial.  It might not 16 have come in if they had been tried separately, but in 17 fact, that evidence would be relevant to aggravator 18 number 1, that the defendant killed multiple people. 19 That would have been admissible evidence and that  20 that just can't be an Eighth Amendment violation. 21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the Kansas  the 22 Kansas Court found independent of the severance question 23 that there was constitutional error in the admission of 24 hearsay. 25             MR. McALLISTER:  That's the third question
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 presented in the cert position on which the Court has

6

2 not taken any action yet, Your Honor.

3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.  But when it goes

4 back to Kansas, they can still say thank you for telling

5 us about severance, but we have this other ground that

6 leads to the same bottom line.

7             MR. McALLISTER:  Well, and we are certainly

8 hopeful that the Court will take another look at that

9 second question depending on its resolution of the two

10 questions that are in front of it today.

11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But would 

12             MR. McALLISTER:  But if it goes back in that

13 posture, yes, they would have another ground.

14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Was  was any evidence

15 introduced with respect to one of the defendants that

16 could not have been introduced against the other had

17 there been severance?

18             MR. McALLISTER:  The only arguable evidence

19 really, Justice Kennedy, is what  what Reginald refers

20 to as the corrupting influence.  But even that,

21 arguably, would be relevant to the mercy consideration

22 to show his character, the nature of this person that is

23 being sentenced.

24             And that was the notion that his mother

25 testified that sometimes  of course, Jonathan looked

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
7 1 up to his big brother, and maybe sometimes Reginald was 2 a bad influence on him.  But that's  that was really 3 the extent of that evidence.  And that might have come 4 in as a rebuttal to a mercy argument. 5             The Kansas Supreme Court did not really 6 definitively say that was even State law error, but even 7 if you assumed it was  8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me  9             MR. McALLISTER:   it would only be State 10 law. 11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   what the 12 constitutional standard you're asking us to apply?  I  13 this argument goes to harmless error; a serious position 14 to take, that even if there was error, no foul  a foul 15 but no penalty.  Okay? 16             But what standard are we applying?  We are 17 not applying the rule  or are we or should we apply 18 the Rule 14 standard? 19             MR. McALLISTER:  No, not  not for Eighth 20 Amendment purposes, Your Honor.  Kansas would propose  21 and I suspect the United States can propose something as 22 well, but it's a very high standard as an Eighth 23 Amendment matter.  And we would say  we would be 24 content to accept something like it's a serious risk 25 that a defendant will not be able to receive

1 individualized sentencing.  It is sort of molding the

8

2 traditional notions of joinder with the Eighth Amendment

3 consideration, because that seems to be the only Eighth

4 Amendment consideration here, is the individualized

5 sentencing.

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it the Eighth Amendment

7 or is it due process?

8             MR. McALLISTER:  Well, you could use a due

9 process standard, Justice Scalia, which we would also be

10 fine with.  The question would really be, did joinder so

11 infect the process with unfairness that the proceedings

12 are fundamentally unfair.

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That seems like a  a

14 language that is relevant rather than the cruel and

15 unusual punishments language.

16             MR. McALLISTER:  Well, and that's exactly

17 what this Court said in Romano v. Oklahoma, a case in

18 which the defendant's other death sentence in a separate

19 case was admitted against the defendant in the

20 sentencing proceeding.  That sentence later got

21 reversed, and the Oklahoma court said the jury should

22 not have heard about his other sentence as a matter of

23 State law.  That defendant Romano said it is an Eighth

24 Amendment violation, and it's a due process violation.

25 The Court said the Eighth Amendment doesn't have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
9 1 anything to say about what's admissible really.  That is 2 State evidentiary rules, that's not an Eighth Amendment 3 issue. 4             And the Court went on to address the due 5 process claim in Romano, applying that very standard. 6 And as we suggest the Court should do here, one of the 7 things it pointed to specifically was jury instructions 8 that said these are the aggravating circumstances you 9 may consider, you may not consider any others.  The 10 court said we presume the jury follows its instructions, 11 and nothing in the instructions gave the jury here any 12 way to give effect to that improperly admitted evidence. 13             And that's true here to the extent Reginald 14 Carr argues some of this evidence was really used as a 15 nonstatutory aggravating circumstance.  By statute, 16 Kansas does not allow anything other than statutory 17 aggravating circumstances.  In the instructions  No. 5 18 I think for Reginald, No. 7 for Jonathan  very 19 explicitly and clearly say, here are the four 20 aggravating circumstances the State has alleged.  And 21 then the next paragraph, you may not consider anything 22 else as an aggravating circumstance. 23             So in our view, the most the Kansas Supreme 24 Court could come up with is potential violation of State 25 law if, in fact, the evidence which is minimal in the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1 greater scheme of this proceeding that Reginald was a 2 corrupting influence on Jonathan, if that would not have 3 been admitted, that's really all the Kansas Supreme 4 Court is left with to hang its hat on in finding  in 5 saying there is an Eighth Amendment violation here. 6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you tell me if you're 7 aware, in other States or perhaps even in Kansas in 8 other trials, is it a common practice to sever when 9 there  for the penalty phase when there are multiple 10 defendants? 11             MR. McALLISTER:  Justice Kennedy, I think in 12 the briefs  I do not remember the exact page  there 13 are two States that mandate severance  one, Ohio  14 and that's, I think, Georgia and Mississippi. 15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  This is just for penalty 16 phase? 17             MR. McALLISTER:  I think it's for the entire 18 proceeding.  And then Ohio, there is a presumption in 19 the favor of severance, but all the other States, there 20 is nothing that mandates or even, I think, creates a 21 presumption of  22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems it would be very 23 difficult for the trial judge to decide which should go 24 first. 25             MR. McALLISTER:  It would, and that's one of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1 the reasons  I mean, not just judicial economy but, in 2 a sense, overall fairness  3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes. 4             MR. McALLISTER:   having them tried 5 together and you don't have one defendant having an 6 opportunity to preview the evidence that the State may 7 present and the arguments that may be made.  This Court 8 has recognized that potential tactical advantage in 9 other joinder cases.  Of course, it has not had a 10 joinder capital case like this, but in other 11 circumstances that's a factor. 12             The Court has also emphasized the 13 consistency of determinations with respect to facts.  We 14 are not saying the outcomes have to be the same, but 15 when the evidence, the mitigation evidence is 99 percent 16 overlapping  they were using the same witnesses, even 17 their experts were coauthors.  They were testifying to 18 the exact same things essentially about each brother. 19             All that overlapping evidence, what this 20 allows is a consistent determination by the jury and 21 evaluation of all that mitigating evidence that leads to 22 whatever outcome the jury decides.  But the jury was 23 very clearly told to consider each defendant 24 individually.  And that's what they got, was individual 25 consideration.

1             I would say also, remember, even if this

12

2 Court were to think there were some kind of error which

3 Kansas simply does not see here  again, at most,

4 possibly an error of Kansas law, not an Eighth Amendment

5 violation  it would have to be harmless under any

6 standard, and Kansas would accept any standard that is

7 beyond a reasonable doubt certainly here.  Given the

8 four uncontested aggravating circumstances 

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you'd also have to

10 look  you have it at the top of your head, maybe

11 forget if you don't, but what I thought I would do is I

12 wanted to look to the aggravating circumstances, what

13 were they.

14             MR. McALLISTER:  What were they.

15             JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's call it "he was the

16 monster" approach.  Reginald was the monster and

17 Jonathan was the puppet or whatever.  I want to look at

18 the aggravators.  I also want to look at the mitigators

19 that Reginald said existed, and then see if this

20 comparative monster, let's call it, fits into any of

21 them.

22             Do you know?  Do you know the pages where

23 they are, just by chance?

24             MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I think the  in

25 terms of the  yes, the aggravating circumstances are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 set forth in the instructions, Justice Breyer, so 

13

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  I know where they

3 are.

4             MR. McALLISTER:  Yeah, Instruction No. 5 for

5 Reginald and Instruction No. 7 for Jonathan, and then

6 following each one, so I believe Instruction No. 6 and

7 Instruction No. 8.

8             But the mitigating  those are the

9 statutory mitigating circumstances.  So what happens in

10 these cases is the jury is told, here are the statutory.

11 And we list all of them that are listed in the Kansas

12 statute.  And then you can 

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  On what page do you list

14 them?

15             MR. McALLISTER:  Well, so those are listed

16 in Instruction No. 6 and Instruction No. 8.  It's all in

17 the petition 

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  If, in fact, this gets in,

19 then I guess what I have to do is go through this huge

20 record on the sentencing anyway and see do I really

21 think that this evidence that came in that the younger

22 one thought the older one was the monster, et cetera,

23 did it really have an effect?

24             MR. McALLISTER:  Well 

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that what I would have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1 to do?  I don't see how I could avoid that if they are 2 at all relevant. 3             MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I would say, first of 4 all, if were you to do that, it would be quite clear. 5 The evidence is overwhelming. 6             But furthermore, the premise is not 7 supported really by the record.  They say Jonathan's 8 whole strategy was to paint Reginald as the bad actor 9 here.  That's not really what happened.  What they both 10 presented was lots of witnesses and testimony about 11 their  their childhood and their experiences growing 12 up, and they presented psychological experts to talk 13 about their mental condition.  No expert said Reginald 14 had some kind of psychological control over Jonathan. 15 That  that testimony, to the extent it's there at all, 16 comes from their mother. 17             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But what do you think about 18 a case, whether or not this is that case, in which it is 19 quite clear to a judge that each of two defendants is 20 just going to be pointing to the other person and 21 saying, that was the bad actor.  He is why these 22 terrible crimes committed.  And you know that  you 23 know, each of them is going to be doing that. 24             Should a judge separate the penalty 25 proceeding in that context?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
15 1             MR. McALLISTER:  Well, not necessarily.  If 2 the high standard is met that it will not be possible, 3 perhaps, to give individualized consideration to each in 4 an Eighth Amendment or a due process standard is going 5 to be so fundamentally unfair, if you can meet that very 6 high standard, then  but that's always been the 7 Court's approach.  It is a casebycase determination. 8 Even Zafiro, which is a joinder case  9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I guess I am asking 10 you in what kind of factual circumstances you would find 11 that standard met? 12             MR. McALLISTER:  Rarely, but I think it 13 would be  certainly the Court has recognized in 14 Bruton, you have some sort of codefendant confession  15 I mean, confession situations, if there was something 16 that had not been used in the guilt phase, might be 17 relevant in the sentencing.  That might be so 18 prejudicial. 19             We have tried to think of other examples.  I 20 might suggest something like one is claiming at that 21 point in time some kind of insanity, even though they 22 didn't succeed on that at trial.  If there was something 23 really starkly contradictory in their presentations and 24 you were going to get a lot of evidence about one that 25 really had nothing to do at all with the other.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
16 1             But we do believe it's a high standard that 2 would rarely be satisfied, especially given the Court's 3 longstanding presumption that the jury follows its 4 instructions.  And that's one thing I would point out 5 here, the complaints that each makes in this Court. 6 First of all, at least one of those complaints really 7 wasn't even made in the Kansas Supreme Court, much less 8 the trial court, and that's the shackling of Reginald 9 and whether that might have prejudiced Jonathan. 10             But they  there was no complaints during 11 the sentencing proceeding.  This corrupting influence 12 evidence is relevant only for Jonathan's mitigation 13 case, not with respect to Reginald; can we have a 14 limiting instruction?  Reginald has antisocial 15 personality disorder; there was no request for any sort 16 of limiting that that  that's not applicable to 17 Jonathan.  Although, of course, the irony there is that 18 Jonathan's own expert all but diagnosed him as 19 antisocial personality.  He said out of 26 risk factors 20 that the Department of Justice has recognized for 21 violence and sexual violence, Jonathan has 24 of them. 22             And both brothers talked about family 23 history of mental illness.  Both brothers and their 24 experts talked about whether some of these things were 25 hereditary or genetic.  This was really a case in which
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 it made very good sense to proceed with a joint

17

2 proceeding, because the evidence, 99 percent was

3 overlapping, essentially.  I mean, they were calling the

4 same witnesses, taking turns with those witnesses.

5 Judicial economy nor fairness, neither one would have

6 been served any better by separating this into two

7 proceedings.

8             And, in fact, I will conclude for now,

9 unless there are further questions, with this

10 observation, that prior to trial, to the guilt phase,

11 the prosecution actually offered to have two juries sit

12 through this proceeding.  Jonathan's attorney said he

13 would consider it, and Reginald's attorney rejected it.

14             So the State even tried to  to agree to

15 some workable system and  and it was declined.

16             So unless there are further questions, I

17 will reserve the remainder of my time.

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

20            ORAL ARGUMENT OF RACHEL P. KOVNER

21    ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

22                   SUPPORTING PETITIONER

23             MS. KOVNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

24 please the Court:

25             The Kansas Supreme Court erred when it found

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that the State violated the Eighth Amendment by

18

2 conducting joint sentencing proceedings for the crimes

3 the Respondents committed together.  Joint proceedings

4 can enhance accuracy and fairness, as a long line of

5 this Court's cases hold.  They provide a fuller

6 evidentiary record to juries that are assessing relative

7 culpability, and they prevent arbitrary disparities that

8 may arise when two juries reach inconsistent conclusions

9 about the common facts of a single crime.

10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Kovner, is there

11 any difference between the Federal government's position

12 and the position of the State of Kansas on this

13 question?

14             MS. KOVNER:  As to the standard, I think

15 there's a small difference.  I think our proposal is

16 that the constitutional standard is whether evidence or

17 argument resulted in a denial of due process or the

18 deprivation of an individualized sentencing proceeding.

19             And that's slightly different from Kansas's

20 standard, because Kansas is proposing a rule that

21 involves analysis of risk, and we think that is part of

22 the statutory rule under Rule 14, as Justice Sotomayor

23 alluded to.  It's also part of the statutory standard

24 that states "by and large are applying," but we think

25 the constitutional question is just, was this person

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
19 1 deprived of a fair trial by the evidence that came in? 2 And that's the constitutional question. 3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  When you said it the first 4 time, you had "deprived of a fair trial" and then 5 something about individualized sentencing; is that 6 right?  Is that supposed to indicate that this is 7 deriving both from the Due Process Clause and from the 8 Eighth Amendment? 9             MS. KOVNER:  Well, the Eighth Amendment does 10 speak to this need for an individualized sentencing 11 determination.  We would think that the Due Process 12 Clause also requires that proceedings be individualized. 13 But we would agree that if there were a situation where 14 there was a joint trial and because of the evidence 15 introduced by one, for instance, a jury simply could not 16 give individualized consideration to a second  second 17 defendant, that would be a constitutional problem. 18             And to give an example of that  I mean, I 19 think the example the Court suggests in Zafiro of that 20 is where there is aggravating evidence that pertains 21 only to one defendant, but that that aggravating 22 evidence is just so prejudicial and so overpowering that 23 the jury couldn't really separate the two and would be 24 inclined to sort of judge the second one by association. 25             So I think that's the example the Court
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 gives in Zafiro.  But it's not 

20

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't you think

3 individualized consideration is required even in the

4 noncapital cases?

5             MS. KOVNER:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  So I

6 think 

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's really a due process

8 consideration, isn't it?

9             MS. KOVNER:  I think due process encompasses

10 that requirement of individualized consideration.

11             Just to address several of the points that

12 came up during Petitioner's argument, I think  as to

13 the question that Justice Kagan asked about whether,

14 when defendants are simply pointing the finger at each

15 other, that would necessitate severance.  I think that's

16 the question that the Court addressed in Zafiro, where

17 that was essentially the claim the defendants were

18 making, that we're both going to point the finger at

19 each other at trial.  And the Court said that doesn't

20 necessitate severance; that that may, in fact, increase

21 the jury's ability to reach an accurate verdict, to

22 reach an accurate assessment of relative culpability,

23 and enhance fairness.  So we don't think that that's a

24 situation that would require severance.

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I  I guess the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
21 1 strongest evidence for Reginald is Temica's testimony. 2 It's  it's pretty prejudicial.  She said he's  he's 3 the one who  he said he's the one who shot. 4             MS. KOVNER:  I don't think that that's 5 prejudicial evidence, certainly not any constitutional 6 problem with the admission of that evidence.  I don't 7 think that even Reginald Carr is asserting that that 8 evidence couldn't have come in against him.  Rather he 9 is asserting or the State below suggested  the State 10 court below suggested maybe that  maybe the State 11 didn't know about that evidence, and maybe just as a 12 factual matter it wouldn't have come in. 13             But there's no constitutional unfairness 14 with evidence coming in on a codefendant's case that's 15 harmful but accurate as to you.  That's something the 16 Court said in  in Zafiro.  If it's accurate and 17 relevant evidence that comes in on a codefendant's 18 case, there's no constitutional unfairness as to you. 19             I think Reginald's primary claim before this 20 Court is that there was a violation of State evidentiary 21 law because some of the other evidence, the evidence of 22 bad influence, might not have come in under the State 23 rules.  I think this Court's cases are clear that a 24 violation of State evidentiary law is simply a matter of 25 State law.  The State could decide that necessitates
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 reversal, but it's not a constitutional error.  That's 2 what this Court said in Romano. 3             JUSTICE BREYER:  It would depend on what is 4 was, wouldn't it?  I mean, so I'm still asking the same 5 question.  If the  I take it that Reginald could not 6 have introduced evidence refuting these brothers' state 7 of mind that he was the monster.  That's what you're 8 referring to by the bad influence. 9             So the jury might have taken that evidence 10 into account in trying to decide whether Reginald, for 11 other reasons than in the statute, was a sympathetic 12 enough character not to provide the death penalty. 13 That's conceivable. 14             But severance is very, very rare, and joint 15 trials are very common.  And very common is the claim on 16 an appeal in any kind of a case that it shouldn't  it 17 should have been severed. 18             So do you have cases that you can think of 19 that would be good precedent for you where a court, 20 including particularly this Court, said, of course there 21 might be a little prejudice here, some, but it's not 22 enough to warrant severance?  Because I think what I 23 have to do is read the record on this point, and then I 24 need something to compare it with. 25             MS. KOVNER:  Well, I want to go back  I'd
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 like to answer the question and then go back to the

23

2 premise 

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

4             MS. KOVNER:   because I am not sure I

5 agree with the premise.

6             But as to whether any prejudice is a

7 problem, I think the best case for us is Zafiro.  Zafiro

8 talks about the idea that what you need  that joinder

9 is presumably going to enhance fairness and accuracy.

10 And what you need is substantial prejudice, even to have

11 a statutory problem, and then  even then we are going

12 to presume that a limiting instruction would be

13 sufficient to cure it.

14             So that would be our best case on that

15 point.

16             But, Your Honor, I think the inquiry under

17 the Eighth Amendment has to be would the Constitution

18 have prohibited this evidence from coming in as to

19 Reginald Carr.  And we think the answer is no.  Any

20 evidence that's relevant to an individual defendant 

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, normally in severance

22 cases, forgetting the death cases, seems to me the

23 argument has been, look, they never would have gotten

24 this piece of evidence in against my client.  They

25 brought it in against the other client.  Now, go look at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
24 1 that evidence and you'll see how much my prejudice  2 that my client was prejudiced by that. 3             I do not know whether you call that due 4 process.  Maybe you do.  But that's the kind of argument 5 which seems for a quantitative weighing.  That's why I 6 asked the question. 7             MS. KOVNER:  I think I would go back to 8 Zafiro again on that one, Your Honor, because I think 9 Zafiro establishes that when accurate evidence comes in 10 through a codefendant that is relative  that's 11 relevant to the jury's determination, that's not 12 prejudice.  That's information that may enhance the 13 accuracy of what the jury  14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you tell me why we 15 should apply the Zafiro standard, which was joint 16 trials, but this is joint sentencing where there is a 17 different  why there should be exactly the same 18 standard applied? 19             MS. KOVNER:  So we think Zafiro  20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you need 21 individualized sentencing?  So can't you say, or aren't 22 you required to say that something a little bit more 23 than  than the efficiency of a joint trial has to 24 compel  25             MS. KOVNER:  Yes, Your Honor.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
25 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   has to be considered? 2             MS. KOVNER:  Yes, Your Honor.  We agree that 3 sentencings may involve special considerations.  What we 4 think Zafiro establishes is that generally when more 5 relevant information is placed before a jury, that's not 6 prejudice to a defendant, that's not unfair, and that 7 juries with more information are likely to make more 8 accurate decisions, and we think that's equally true at 9 sentencing. 10             And, similarly, that juries with more  who 11 are confronted with two defendants together can avoid 12 the unwarranted disparities that may occur when juries 13 reach different results  two different juries 14 considering the same facts reach different results on 15 those facts.  And that's equally true at sentencing. 16             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Sorry, but I'm not  17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You  you would need 18 two  two separate juries, wouldn't you?  I mean  19             MS. KOVNER:  That's  that's what the 20 Kansas Supreme Court said here.  And the result of that 21 is  is going to be that two different juries 22 confronted with the very same aggravating circumstances 23 in largely parallel mitigation cases may simply weigh 24 factors like mercy differently. 25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But wouldn't  wouldn't
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the second jury have to know the facts relevant to

26

2 mitigation, as well as aggravation, I suppose, that came

3 out in the main trial?

4             MS. KOVNER:  It's  it's certainly

5 possible, Your Honor, that if there was a second jury,

6 the government could simply introduce, for instance, the

7 evidence of Reginald Carr's statement to his sister at

8 the second trial.  So you're introducing this disparity

9 that Justice Kennedy alluded to between the defendant

10 who goes first and the defendant who goes second.

11             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, would this second jury

12 have been present for the  for the guilt phase?

13             MS. KOVNER:  Well, in  in the Federal

14 system, there are a number of ways you could do it.

15 Could you have two juries that hear both the guilt phase

16 and  and the penalty phase.  You could have a second

17 jury impanelled only for the  the penalty phase.  But

18 then in a case like this, you would need to essentially

19 repeat all the trial evidence, including calling victims

20 again, because that  because the State was relying on

21 its evidence from the trial phase, and that is

22 generally, we submit, going to be the case.

23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think I missed something

24 you said, but  forgive me.  But the constitutional

25 standard that you're proposing, is that a constitutional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 standard for both the guilt phase and the sentencing

27

2 phase?  And is it also for both noncapital and capital?

3 Are you drawing no distinctions among those four things?

4             MS. KOVNER:  I think that's right, Your

5 Honor.  I mean, that  because we think that the due

6 process standard essentially subsumes the requirement of

7 individualized consideration, and, of course, due

8 process is applicable at the trial phase and at the

9 sentencing phase in capital and noncapital trials.

10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So it seems a little bit

11 counterintuitive to me, the idea that, you know, the

12 guilt phase in a very minor crime would have the exact

13 same standard applicable to it as the guilt phase of a

14 capital crime and then as the sentencing phase of a

15 capital crime.

16             MS. KOVNER:  If I may answer really briefly?

17 Your Honor, we think the reason that's the case is that

18 joint trials often enhance accuracy and fairness.  So we

19 agree that accuracy and fairness considerations are at

20 their paramount in capital cases, but we do not think

21 that militates for a different standard in capital cases

22 because we think that the standard that the courts are

23 applying is one that's going to generally enhance those

24 values.

2              ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK LIU

3        ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN NO. 14450

4             MR. LIU:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may please

5 the Court:

6             I want to begin by emphasizing how narrow

7 our rule is.  Justice Kagan asked the question involving

8 a  a case where the two defendants pointed their

9 fingers at each other.  We are not advocating a rule

10 that would require severance in any case where two

11 defendants point their fingers at  at each other.

12             We are advocating a rule that this Court has

13 recognized in Zant, Stringer, in Sanders, that  that

14 an Eighth Amendment violation occurs when the weighing

15 process itself is skewed.  And the weighing 

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  But are you saying the

17 severance rule is the same in noncapital as in capital

18 cases?

19             MR. LIU:  The general severance rule, Your

20 Honor, is the same.

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  And you just look for

22 prejudice?

23             MR. LIU:  Exactly.  The general rule is you

24 can't have severance when it would compromise someone's

25 constitutional rights.  The right at issue here just

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 happens to be an Eighth Amendment right, but we are not 2 advocating an Eighth Amendment rule that would apply 3 beyond the capital context or even beyond the penalty 4 phase.  That's  5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You know, if you 6 violated an individualized sentence, why would we apply 7 harmless error review?  Meaning, it seems 8 counterintuitive.  We are now becoming the sentencing  9 the sentencing body.  No? 10             MR. LIU:  Absolutely.  And I think  11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh, so then we have to 12 do the  in harmless error, we have to decide whether 13 the aggravators outweighed the mitigators, et cetera, so 14 much that none of the error could have affected that 15 choice? 16             MR. LIU:  Well, this Court, Your Honor, 17 recognized in Satterwhite precisely how difficult it 18 would be to conduct a harmless error analysis in a 19 penalty phase, and that's precisely because there are so 20 many factors involved. 21             Sure, the crimes in the case were horrific, 22 but that's just one side of the scale in a harmless 23 error inquiry.  There is an entire other side of the 24 balance, the mitigation side.  And so it is quite 25 difficult for this Court, on a cold record, to go
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 through the harmless error analysis.

30

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I  I 

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  We have to do it, though,

4 right?  I mean, that's  that's part of  part of our

5 jurisprudence.

6             So what  what do you think are the 

7 are  are the factors that would suggest the jury would

8 have come out a different way had the rule that you urge

9 been adopted?  What  what specifically?  One is the

10 shackling of the  of the codefendant?

11             MR. LIU:  Well, we are not representing

12 Reginald Carr.  We're not basing our claim around the

13 shackling.  Our  our claim revolves around the

14 evidence that Jonathan presented that Reginald had a

15 corrupting influence on him while they were growing up.

16 And that evidence, as the Kansas Supreme Court itself

17 held at Petition Appendix 411, falls beyond the rubric

18 of any valid sentencing factor.

19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Liu, I mean, given

20 the kind of evidence that was presented in this case,

21 the idea that somebody was a lousy big brother seems

22 pretty small on  in the  in the scale of things.

23             MR. LIU:  Well, a few responses to that.  To

24 begin with, I think Your  Your Honor is understating

25 the evidence here.  This wasn't just that Reginald was a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 lousy big brother.  It was that he did things to

31

2 Jonathan that turned Jonathan into the person who was

3 capable of committing and even leading these crimes.  So

4 this wasn't just "lousy big brother" evidence, this was

5 evidence that Reginald himself was the source of what

6 caused Jonathan to do the things he did.

7             But, Your Honor, I think it's also important

8 to keep in mind two separate parts of the inquiry; there

9 is the violation and the harmless error analysis.  And

10 this Court said in Stringer that even a thumb on the

11 scales is enough to skew the weighing process in

12 violation of the Eighth Amendment.

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But what  what

14 evidence that shouldn't have been admitted wouldn't have

15 been admitted in the  in the separate trial?

16             MR. LIU:  Well, all this evidence, Mr. Chief

17 Justice, that says Reginald was a corrupting influence

18 on his brother, that wouldn't have come in in a separate

19 trial for two reasons:  Number one, as the Kansas

20 Supreme Court held at Petition Appendix 411, that

21 evidence was improper, nonstatutory, aggravating

22 evidence, which is to say, all the aggravating factors

23 before the prosecution pursuit in this case all had to

24 do with the circumstances of the crime.

25             But this evidence had nothing to do with the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
32 1 circumstances of what happened on December 15th, it had 2 to do with the defendant's character concerning 3 circumstances that occurred years, even decades, before 4 the crimes at issue. 5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, wait a minute. 6 You're  you're representing the brother who was 7 the alleged corrupting influence, right? 8             MR. LIU:  That's right, the corruptor. 9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The corruptor was 10 sentenced, by the same jury, to death.  So how could it 11 possibly be that without the corrupting action of your 12 client, the jury would have sentenced your client to 13 life even though the corruptee was sentenced to death? 14 That doesn't seem to me at all likely. 15             MR. LIU:  Well, to begin  begin with, I 16 don't think Jonathan Carr's sentence is a proper 17 baseline to use.  As my friend will argue in a few 18 minute, his own sentence was prejudiced by severance. 19             But even moving beyond that, there is every 20 reason to believe that the jury viewed Jonathan as 21 overall more culpable than Reginald.  After all, the 22 State never established who the shooter was here.  If 23 the jury believed that Jonathan was the shooter, the 24 jury could have believed that Jonathan was so culpable 25 that even with his evidence that he had been corrupted
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 by Reginald, it would have given a life sentence.  I

33

2 think 

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let me  let me put the

4 crime to you.  You tell me which of these descriptions

5 of the  of the crime are  are incorrect.  These two

6 men broke into a house in which there were three men and

7 two women.  They ordered the five to remove their

8 clothes, forced them into a closet.  Over the course of

9 three hours, they demanded that the two women perform

10 various sexual acts on one another.  They demanded at

11 gunpoint that each of the three men have sexual

12 intercourse with both women.

13             Then Reginald drove the victims one by one

14 to various ATMs to withdraw cash.  Jonathan raped or

15 attempted to rape both women twice, and Reginald raped

16 Holly G., who later testified, once.  Placing the three

17 men, still naked, in the trunk of one of their cars, the

18 cars drove all five to a soccer field, forced them to

19 kneel in the snow, and shot them executionstyle in the

20 back of the head.

21             One of them, fortuitously, was not killed

22 because  I think it was a hair clip that she was

23 wearing deflected the bullet.  And she is the one who

24 testified to all of this activity.

25             And you truly think  oh, and they ran over

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
34 1 her too.  After shooting her in the head, the car ran 2 over her. 3             You truly think that this jury, but for the 4 fact that your client was a corruptor, would not have 5 imposed the death penalty? 6             MR. LIU:  We do, Justice Scalia.  In your 7 own opinion in last term in Glossip, you noted that the 8 egregiousness of an offense is just one factor in 9 determining whether a sentence is appropriate at the 10 penalty phase.  And Reginald Carr submitted a week and a 11 half full of mitigation evidence that extenuated this 12 offense. 13             So I don't  I think when you  when you 14 take all that all into account and consider the fact 15 that this wasn't an easy case for the jury  the jury, 16 after all, deliberated a full day on what the  what 17 Kansas thinks is quite an easy case. 18             I think the  the scales of the weighing 19 process were much more evenly balanced than that. 20             JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that the desire 21 to spare Holly from having to testify more than once is 22 a relevant factor here?  And if so, how could that be  23 how do you  how would you propose to accommodate them? 24             MR. LIU:  It's not a relevant factor and 25 that's not my saying it, it's this Court saying it.
Alderson Reporting Company

1 This Court in Zafiro and Bruton has said that the

35

2 benefits of joinder, while they may exist, cannot come

3 at the price of constitutional rights.

4             So while I  I completely appreciate that

5 severance would require some duplication of resources,

6 that's precisely the sort of benefit that this Court has

7 said cannot trump the Eighth Amendment.

8             JUSTICE BREYER:  So if you're right, joinder

9 being among the most common kind of thing that gangs and

10 drugs and so forth, why won't the same argument be made

11 over and over preventing  requiring severance in

12 dozens and dozens, perhaps hundreds of cases where the

13 government tries people together?  Because they will say

14 there are different relationships among members of the

15 gang.  Those relationships  some evidence would come

16 in that would negative the relationship that would tend

17 to show that this particular individual wasn't actually

18 involved in this aspect of it, et cetera.

19             That's why my experience on the Courts,

20 lower courts particularly, leads me to think it's a very

21 rarely accepted argument, severance.

22             MR. LIU:  Well, you're right, Justice

23 Breyer 

24             JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's why I'm

25 interested in  I mean, because if it were, you'd find

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
36 1 it very unusual to try people together, which, in fact, 2 is very usual.  And so when you told me there is no 3 separate thing for the death cases, then I imagine it 4 would affect every criminal trial of gangs throughout 5 the country. 6             MR. LIU:  Well, I think  7             JUSTICE BREYER:  And that is something 8 that's concerning me and I am looking for an answer. 9             MR. LIU:  You're absolutely right, Justice 10 Breyer, that under our rule, the circumstances of each 11 case are relevant.  But I think what's also important 12 is  is that some  the circumstances of some cases 13 might not get rise for severance. 14             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what I'm looking 15 for.  Why is it you believe that if I were to decide in 16 your favor on this case and find the sufficient 17 prejudice to warrant severance here, I wouldn't at the 18 same time be throwing a huge monkey wrench  19             MR. LIU:  Right. 20             JUSTICE BREYER:   into the ordinary cases 21 of gangs, drugs, et cetera, where joinder is very common 22 and reversal is very rare. 23             MR.

37 1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you proposing just 2 separate sentencing hearings, or are you proposing 3 separate juries for each of the brothers? 4             MR. LIU:  Well, the Kansas Supreme Court in 5 this case ordered as its remedy a new trial with two 6 juries, but I don't think that is necessarily going to 7 be the required remedy in every case.  There are 8 different ways, Justice Ginsburg, to solve the problems 9 of sentencing. 10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Let's take this case.  If 11 you had only one jury and Jonathan goes first, that 12 jury, when it gets to Reginald's case, is not going to 13 forget everything it heard in Jonathan's case. 14             MR. LIU:  You're absolutely right, Justice 15 Ginsburg.  I don't think a sequential solution with 16 Jonathan going first is going to work in this case 17 precisely because the jury won't  you won't be able to 18 unring the bell of the  precisely the evidence we 19 think is prejudicial in this case.  But that's not to 20 say that a sequential solution isn't going to work in 21 the mine run of cases. 22             This case is special just because there  23 there is some allegation that the prejudice ran both 24 ways. 25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the minute  but the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
38 1 minute you defend the idea of two different juries, then 2 you sacrifice the desirability and the possibility of 3 consistency. 4             MR. LIU:  Well, Justice Kennedy, there are 5 many ways that States have developed to resolve the 6 problem of inconsistent verdicts among different juries. 7 One way is what the Georgia State has done, which is had 8 proportionality review.  They ask the appellate courts 9 to look across many sentences to see if they are 10 inconsistent. 11             Another way the Federal government has a 12 solution to this, is that let one jury know how the 13 other jury sentenced the other defendant.  That's 14 18 U.S.C. 3592(a)(4).  And so there are ways to solve 15 the problem of inconsistent verdicts across juries.  But 16 what's  17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That sounds  that 18 sounds pretty prejudicial to me.  If the second case, 19 you say, oh, the jury considered this and individual 20 circumstances, you know, these people act together, and 21 by the way, a jury of your peers unanimously found 22 beyond a reasonable doubt that this guy should be 23 sentenced to death; now do whatever you want with this 24 guy.  That sounds pretty prejudicial to me. 25             MR. LIU:  Well, it's  it's  if you think
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that is prejudicial, Mr. Chief Justice, then this

39

2 proceeding was quite prejudicial too because the jury

3 was asked to make that same exact comparison.

4             But the specific prejudice we are alleging

5 here is  is unique to these or at least quite  quite

6 restricted to the circumstances of this case.

7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Liu, could you, for me,

8 just tell me what is the specific prejudice you're

9 alleging here?  In other words, tell me more than just,

10 oh, he was a corrupting influence.  What evidence

11 particularly came in 

12             MR. LIU:  Sure.

13             JUSTICE KAGAN:   and why do you think it

14 might have mattered to the jury?  Just give me your,

15 like, best shot.

16             MR. LIU:  Sure.  Well, Kansas said there was

17 no expert testimony on this, but that's wrong.

18 Dr. Cunningham, at Joint Appendix pages 324 to 329,

19 explained how Jonathan looked up to Reggie, and every

20 time they would get together they would do drugs heavily

21 together, that when  that when they were ages 6 or 7,

22 Reginald prompted someone to have sex with Jonathan.

23 These are precisely the sort of evidence that shows that

24 however bad you think Jonathan is, Reginald is worse

25 because Reginald is the one who created the person

Alderson Reporting Company

1 Jonathan is.

Official

40

2             It's in a sense making Reginald doubly

3 culpable for these offenses; that, well, whatever you

4 think Jonathan did  and yes, as Justice Scalia read,

5 there were some horrific things done  well, Reginald

6 should be punished for not only everything Reginald did,

7 but also everything Jonathan did.

8             So this is precisely the sort of evidence

9 that basically transfers all of Jonathan's actions to

10 Reginald.  And that's why it's so prejudicial when you

11 get in the jury room, it's because it  it skews the

12 weighing process.

13             And a skewing of the weighing process is an

14 error this Court has recognized for 30 years.  This

15 isn't something that we  we came up special for this

16 case.  This Court has recognized time and again that

17 when a jury is told to consider an improper element in

18 the weighing process, the weighing process is therefore

19 skewed.  And the only thing that can cure that error is

20 either harmless error review or 

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it 

22             MR. LIU:   reweighing by the State court.

23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it has to have been

24 harmless inasmuch as the person who was influenced by

25 your client also got the death penalty.  How can you say

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that what made the difference was the fact that your

41

2 client was a corrupting influence upon his younger

3 brother?

4             MR. LIU:  Well, Justice Scalia, the State

5 never established the identity of the shooter, and that

6 is the key horrific act in this case.  If the jury

7 believed Jonathan was the shooter, then the jury might

8 have given him the death penalty anyway regardless of

9 what Reginald did to him.

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I doubt whether that is the

11 key.  You really think that that's the only thing the

12 jury is going to be focused on, is who pulled the

13 trigger?  My Lord.

14             MR. LIU:  I don't think it's the only  I

15 don't think it's the only thing, but it's certainly the

16 main thing given that we are here on a capital murder

17 charge.

18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think that on a

19 retrial they cannot use the sister to prove that

20 Reginald claimed he was the shooter?

21             MR. LIU:  No.  And I think that just

22 highlights exactly how narrow our rule is.  That the

23 evidence that Temica said that Reginald told her that

24 Reginald was the shooter goes to the circumstances of

25 the crime.  And that sort of finger pointing, who shot

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 who on the day of the crime, is going to fall

42

2 comfortably within an existing sentencing factor, and as

3 a result, is not going to skew the weighing process.

4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the only issue you

5 think was prejudicial was that he was a corruptor?

6             MR. LIU:  Absolutely.

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The evidence.

8             MR. LIU:  And for reasons I  I gave to

9 Justice Kagan, that evidence was extremely prejudicial.

10 It skewed the weighing process because it transferred

11 Jonathan's culpability back onto Reginald's shoulders.

12             If I may, I'd just like to address a few

13 points raised by my friend from Kansas.  He said the

14 instructions solve the problem.  Well, none of the

15 instructions told the jury to consider this evidence

16 about the corrupting influence only as to Jonathan.

17             Now, on the contrary, the instructions 

18 Instruction No. 2 told the jury consider the evidence

19 applicable to each defendant.  Well, this evidence was

20 equally applicable to Reginald as it was to Jonathan.

21 After all, it was Reginald  Reginald's actions that

22 were at issue.

23             My friends also point to the instruction on

24 statutory aggravators.  But that disregards an entire

25 swath of evidence that the jury heard that it could

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 consider against Reginald.  This was evidence,

43

2 antimitigation evidence that the jury considered, could

3 have caused them to remove weight from the mitigation

4 side of the scale.  And the instructions left the jury

5 completely free to consider this evidence in

6 antimitigation.

7             My friends also suggest that I'm here only

8 arguing an error of State law.  Well, no less than the

9 Petitioners were in Zant, Stringer, and  and Sanders.

10 Each of those cases recognizes that a skewing of the

11 weighing process has to be based on State law premises.

12 That's why this Court in Zant went so far as to certify

13 a question to the Georgia Supreme Court.

14             Yes, it's true that to understand the effect

15 on the weighing process, you have to look at the State

16 law.  But the mere admission of evidence isn't what

17 causes the violation here.  It's the admission of the

18 evidence, followed by the fact the jury was required to

19 consider it.  And it was required to consider it because

20 it was part and parcel of Jonathan's mitigating

21 evidence.

22             And this Court has said time and again that

23 a defendant has a constitutional right for the jury, not

24 only to consider but to listen to a defendant's

25 mitigating evidence.  So by considering this evidence

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
44 1 for Jonathan, the jury necessarily considered it against 2 Reginald.  After all, if you're told that Reginald had a 3 corrupting influence on Jonathan, you can't separate 4 that as something for Jonathan and something for 5 Reginald.  It's equally applicable to both. 6             My friend also suggested that we  we 7 rejected a twojury solution before trial.  Well, we 8 rejected that, not because of it wouldn't work to solve 9 any prejudice in the penalty phase, but because it 10 wouldn't work to solve any prejudice in the guilt phase. 11             And remember, the Kansas Supreme Court found 12 that it was actually error to keep the guilt phase 13 joined, so we were perfectly appropriate in objecting to 14 a twojury solution at that phase of the trial. 15             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you explain that 16 again?  I thought you  you sought only a severance at 17 the sentencing phase. 18             MR. LIU:  No.  That's not  that's not  19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You sought severance 20 totally? 21             MR. LIU:  Exactly.  Prior to trial, on pages 22 25 and 26 of the Joint Appendix, we moved for severance 23 of the entire thing. 24             And if you look at those pages, you'll see 25 Jonathan's attorney, Jonathan's own attorney, saying
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 that if the penalty phase is joined, he is going to have 2 to present evidence that, quote, "there's no way the 3 State would be able to introduce if Reginald was sitting 4 here alone." 5             Well, his attorney was exactly right. 6 That's exactly what happened many months later. 7             I see that my time is up. 8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 9             Mr. Green. 10            ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN 11        ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN NO. 14449 12             MR. GREEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 13 please the Court: 14             I'd like to first try and change the 15 narrative here with some illustrations about the 16 difference between the mitigation cases of both 17 defendants.  That's easily seen in the testimony of the 18 experts. 19             Reginald Carr presented evidence from a 20 neuroscientist by the name of Dr. Woltersdorf that said 21 his client had been diagnosed a  an incurable 22 sociopath. 23             Jonathan Carr's forensic psychologist, 24 clinical and forensic psychologist, got up and testified 25 that  that Jonathan was sensitive, he was
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 affectionate, he had attempted suicide, and what he

46

2 really was, contrary to what Mr. McAllister represented

3 to you, was  was depressed and schizophrenic.

4             That is  that is a unique illustration of

5 exactly how different these two defendants were in their

6 presentation, and why, again, a sequential penalty

7 phase, even if they had been separate, wouldn't work.

8             Reginald says he didn't want to hear or he

9 thought it would be prejudicial if the jury heard

10 evidence from the  from the  from Jonathan's

11 witnesses about Reginald being a  a corrupting

12 influence.  On the other side, Jonathan doesn't want the

13 jury to hear from Reginald's expert.

14             And to answer your question, Justice Kagan,

15 that's the evidence that would not have been introduced.

16             Justice Woltersdorf's  or excuse me 

17 Dr. Woltersdorf's testimony about incurable sociopathy

18 would not have been relevant or admissible 

19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Maybe I'm missing something,

20 but if  if your client's strategy was to make Reginald

21 as bad  the bad actor in the case, why didn't that

22 evidence actually go hand in hand with your client's

23 strategy, which was to say it's all on Reginald?

24             MR. GREEN:  One  one would think that it

25 would in  in a typical case, and it may be that some

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 jurors had inferred that way.

47

2             The problem was that  that the fact that

3 the two brothers were sitting together allowed the

4 prosecutors to repeatedly paint them with the same

5 brush.

6             And  and if we take a look, for example,

7 at JA 402, the prosecutor says to the jury in her

8 opening argument at the beginning of the penalty  or

9 at the conclusion of the penalty phase, ladies and

10 gentlemen, they have the same eye color.  They are now

11 wearing glasses, although their mother said Reginald

12 doesn't need them, they share some DNA.

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  So this  maybe you can,

14 in your experience, cure what's bothering me about the

15 case.  It's nothing to do with the facts, or for this 

16 this concern.  It has to do with  with Zafiro.

17             MR. GREEN:  Right.

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's the ordinary

19 case of joint trials, right?

20             And what the Court says is you can have the

21 joinder as long as there isn't a serious risk that the

22 joint trial would compromise  it doesn't say harmless

23 error, it says compromise  a specific trial right, or

24 prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment.  That

25 doesn't talk about harmless error.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             Now, that's the standard that's used in

48

2 dozens and dozens and dozens of cases.

3             Or if, in this case, we start talking about

4 harmless error, and that you can't have the joint

5 proceeding if there is error that is not harmless.

6 Well, what have we done to that sentence?  And what have

7 we done to the trials that are joint in hundreds of

8 cases that don't involve murder or death?

9             That is the legal problem that is worrying

10 me.  And you will either cure that worry or say I've

11 made some elementary mistake.  It has nothing to do with

12 your case.  Say what you want, but I want to hear what

13 you think about it.

14             MR. GREEN:  I don't  I don't think you've

15 made any mistake at all, Justice Breyer.  Indeed, I

16 think that  that the State of Kansas and the Solicitor

17 General are offering nothing more than  than the

18 Zafiro test and using slightly different language.

19             On page 15 of our 

20             JUSTICE BREYER:  So we should not use the

21 words "harmless error."  We should quote from Zafiro and

22 say could they make a reliable judgment?  Now, that

23 sounds harder on you, because if all you have to show is

24 the error was harmful, it sounds like an easier task you

25 have than to show that the juror  jury wasn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
49 1 reliable.  Or are they the same thing in your opinion? 2             MR. GREEN:  Well, let me  I think they're 3 the same thing and I think that's a generalization, but 4 we've  we've offered a test that actually specifies it 5 a little bit more, Justice Breyer. 6             In terms of saying that  that the test 7 should be whether there is a reasonable risk  and I 8 will explain the difference between reasonable and 9 serious in a minute  but whether there was a 10 reasonable risk that there would be evidence introduced, 11 material, prejudicial evidence introduced that would  12 that would, in fact, not have been introduced in a 13 severed penaltyphase proceeding. 14             And to go back to Justice Kagan's question 15 about the intuitive difference between these two things, 16 they're between  excuse me  trials and  and 17 penaltyphase proceedings, the answer is that's because 18 in a  in a trial, the  the relative culpability of 19 the defendants makes a big difference with respect to 20 who's a conspirator, who's not a conspirator, who's a 21 principal, who's an aider and abettor. 22             But when we turn to the penalty phase, the 23 inquiry changes, as Mr. Liu indicated  it changes from 24 exactly what happened to who this person is and whether 25 or not the jury wants to put this person to death.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
50 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Who  who  if you 2 have separate proceedings, who  who gets to go second? 3 Because obviously that person will have a significant 4 advantage since they'll see all of the evidence 5 presented in the  in the other proceeding. 6             MR. GREEN:  Well, in  7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And most of the 8 evidence here was overlapping, so that at least you'll 9 have  you'll be able to see what the State thought 10 about that evidence.  You have sort of a dry run if 11 you're the second person. 12             MR. GREEN:  Well, in this case, 13 respectfully, no, Mr. Chief Justice, because what the  14 what the State basically said was we're relying on our 15 evidence from the  from the trial phase  or from the 16 guilt phase of this capital trial. 17             That's exactly what the prosecutor told the 18 jurors when they turned in to the penalty phase, and all 19 that the prosecution did in the penalty phase was 20 crossexamine the defense witnesses. 21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that 22 crossexamination is important. 23             Were there any common defense witnesses? 24             MR. GREEN:  There were family members. 25 So  so it is true 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
51 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So at least it would 2 be  it would be helpful for the second  the person 3 who goes second to know, well, what did the prosecutor 4 talk  how did the prosecutor attempt to crossexamine 5 that witness, because I am going to call the same 6 witness, and her testimony is going to be a lot better 7 the second time around because you will know exactly 8 what the crossexamination questions are going to be. 9             MR. GREEN:  That might happen.  I  it  10 it could well be that that would be  I would consider 11 that a  a minor advantage, Your Honor.  But that could 12 be handled by the judge in  with protective orders, 13 with orders about  rules against witnesses and  and 14 folks in the courtroom who will have another proceeding. 15             But I would submit  and then with respect 16 to witnesses who might have been traumatized by these 17 events, that  the  you know, a trial court could 18 easily have a simultaneous penalty proceedings so that 19 that witness would only have to testify once.  The 20 defense team on one side wouldn't get an advantage over 21 the other.  There would be two juries in two different 22 courtrooms, same week, same days, the  the witness can 23 go back and forth between courtrooms, and there is none 24 of the advantage  25             JUSTICE ALITO:  You would have  the State
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
52 1 would have to put on, basically, its guilt phase case 2 again at the penalty phase, right? 3             MR. GREEN:  Yes, it would have to do that, 4 but I would imagine that  that with respect to cases 5 like this, the defense attorneys are going to move right 6 into what counts as stipulations; we will read 7 testimony  8             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I am sure you'd like 9 to stipulate to all the facts that were proven at the 10 guilt phase, but I doubt that the State is going to want 11 to stipulate to those. 12             MR. GREEN:  And the State might do that. 13             And again, I think a trial judge could 14 easily handle that by expediting matters.  And this is 15 what happens in a lot of the Federal trials.  I would 16 refer the Court to the  to the brief of the Promise of 17 Justice Initiative which shows that when we have joint 18 trials, we get joint results.  When we have severed 19 trials, we get severed results.  25 for 25, joint 20 trials, same result for the defendants. 21             Woodson says we must have individualized 22 sentencing at the penalty phase, so I do not see why the 23 Zafiro test would not  would  would work for penalty 24 phase proceedings without some sort of change.  There 25 has to be some recognition that  that penalty phase
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 proceedings are different than  than all the other

53

2 armed robbery, drug cases.

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how is that different

4 from what the government said?

5             MR. GREEN:  I  so I think we ought to

6 lower the risk standard.  We ought to lower the risk

7 standard to a reasonable risk standard, not  and

8 that's what we propose in our brief at page 15.  We

9 should lower the standard because that would recognize

10 the acute need for reliability and accuracy when it

11 comes to penalty phase proceedings and the decision

12 whether somebody is going to live or die.

13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said you were going

14 to make a distinction between serious and reasonable

15 earlier.

16             MR. GREEN:  Right.  So a serious risk may be

17 treated as a  as a preponderance or a   or above.

18 With respect to reasonable, we're at a  we're at a 

19 a  maybe a likelihood.  Maybe that's  maybe that's

20 perceived as 30 percent versus 55 percent or 60 percent,

21 something like that.

22             And indeed, this Court said in Boyde, with

23 respect to reasonable likelihood, that is not a

24 preponderance standard.

25             If the Court has no further questions, we

Alderson Reporting Company

1 would urge 

Official

54

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

3             Mr. McAllister, five minutes.

4        REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER

5                 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6             MR. McALLISTER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may

7 it please the Court:

8             I will try to be brief.  The only Eighth

9 Amendment implication that this Court has recognized

10 that really applies to this case is I go back to the

11 Romano case where the Court said the admission of

12 evidence that might or might not be in violation of

13 State law is not an Eighth Amendment concern.  The only

14 time the Eighth  Eighth Amendment comes into play is

15 when the evidence is  involves constitutionally

16 protected conduct.

17             An example would be Dawson v. Delaware,

18 where they sought a capital sentence.  He was a member

19 of the Aryan Brotherhood in prison.  It had nothing to

20 do with an aggregating factor.  That was First

21 Amendmentprotected activity.  The Court said that kind

22 of thing could be an Eighth Amendment problem if you use

23 it against the defendant.

24             Their cases  I could be wrong, but I think

25 all of their cases, Zant, Stringer, the others that they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 refer to skewing the weighing process, are not about

55

2 admission of evidence, they are about invalid

3 aggravating factors.  So you've basically told the jury

4 there is something else, literally, on the scale, an

5 aggravating factor that later the State says, no, that

6 was  that was not correct, that should not have been

7 there.  That's distinguishable from this case.

8             I  I agree completely with

9 Justice Scalia's point, and the dissenting justice made

10 it in the Kansas Supreme Court:  If the evidence  the

11 corrupting influence evidence was so prejudicial to

12 Reginald, why did Jonathan also get a death sentence?

13             And I would close by saying that we all

14 agree, I think, that the Constitution values accuracy

15 and fairness.  But it also values finality.  And each of

16 these individuals received an individualized sentence,

17 presented all the evidence they wanted to.  The jury was

18 instructed to consider them individually.  And if we

19 were to undo this now, it would be very difficult for

20 Kansas to go back.  We'd be talking about having to redo

21 all of the guilt phase evidence.  And, again, you get

22 into questions, separate proceedings, traumatizing

23 victims yet again.  None of that is necessary, because

24 at the end of the day they got a fundamentally fair

25 proceeding that gave each of them the sentence they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
56 1 deserved and the jury found warranted, both under the 2 facts of this case and the law of Kansas. 3             We would ask that you reverse the Kansas 4 Supreme Court on this point. 5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. McAllister, I am 6 sorry, but even if we do this and say that the 7 sentencings didn't need to be severed, didn't the Kansas 8 court hold on another ground that they were entitled to 9 a new trial? 10             MR. McALLISTER:  Yes.  So that's the third 11 question presented in the Petition, which my 12 understanding is that is something the Court could 13 reconsider.  It's not denied.  The Court granted 14 Questions 1 and 3. 15             The other question that we presented was the 16 only other ground that the Kansas Supreme Court gave for 17 reversal, that's a Confrontation Clause violation in 18 terms of some of the hearsay evidence presented in the 19 sentencing proceedings. 20             So if the Court were to reverse on these, 21 deny on that question, then the Kansas Supreme Court 22 could, in fact, rely on that ground.  But our hope would 23 be that the Court would do something different than that 24 if you reverse on these two questions. 25             Unless there are further questions, thank
Alderson Reporting Company

1 you.
