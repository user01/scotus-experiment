3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 next in Case 14613, Green v. Brennan.

5             Mr. Wolfman.

6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN

7                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8             MR. WOLFMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10             The basic principle of this Court's

11 timeliness cases, Title VII and otherwise, is that the

12 clock starts when the cause of action is complete.

13 Because a constructive discharge claim is complete only

14 after the employee resigns, this Court should reverse.

15             The court has indicated that limitations

16 principles should be as simple as possible.  The Tenth

17 Circuit's rule, however, injects unnecessary complexity.

18 Identifying the last discriminatory act in an alleged

19 hostile work environment can be difficult.

20             And as this Court said in early 

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What does the statute say?

22 Can we look at the statute?  What's it  what does the

23 statute say?

24             MR. WOLFMAN:  The statute says matter 

25 aggrieved party has to bring within 45 days the matter

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 alleged to be discriminatory.

4

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The matter alleged to be

3 discriminatory.  And is the resignation of  of the

4 employee a matter alleged to be discriminatory?

5             MR. WOLFMAN:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  The

6 matter 

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The employee discriminated

8 against himself?

9             MR. WOLFMAN:  No.  The matter  the matter

10 alleged is the whole of the claim.  As the dictionaries

11 say, and as most of the lower courts say, the matter is

12 just a shorthanded way of referring to the cause of

13 action that the  the person is bringing.

14             Here, the matter  and this is

15 undisputed  is a constructive discharge which, as this

16 Court said in Suders, has two elements, both the

17 precipitating conduct and the resignation.  Without

18 both, there is no constructive discharge claim.

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But for a constructive

20 discharge claim to succeed you have to point to a

21 discriminatory or an unlawful act.

22             MR. WOLFMAN:  It is true that 

23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so we have to find

24 this anyway.

25             MR. WOLFMAN:  It is true that that is one

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
5 1 component.  There is no question that there are going to 2 be  again, Suders said there would be both 3 precipitating conduct and the resignation; both elements 4 must be present for there to be constructive discharge. 5             But  but let's assume for a second that 6 the  that the  the matter alleged to be 7 discriminatory is ambiguous in some sense.  Then the 8 court should just go to its timehonored default rule. 9 Default rule is that the cause of action must be fully 10 formed before the limitations period is triggered. 11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course.  That's  that 12 rule is adopted for statutes that do not have a 13 conciliation provision.  What use is the conciliation 14 provision once the employee has quit? 15             MR. WOLFMAN:  I  I think not, Your Honor. 16 The conciliation process always anticipates that the 17 claim will have occurred; that the acts giving rise to 18 the claim, including all the elements, have occurred 19 before conciliation  20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's fine, but the 21 employer can make it up, you know.  It's  they try to 22 bring the employer and the employee together. 23             MR. WOLFMAN:  That is true. 24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right? 25             MR. WOLFMAN:  But only 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
6 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But he's quit.  He's gone. 2 He's no longer an employee.  What conciliation can there 3 be? 4             MR. WOLFMAN:  Your Honor, that is true for 5 any of the acts that could be brought prior to the 6 45day trigger.  For instance, a termination would fit 7 exactly the scenario you're suggesting, a termination 8 which, after all, is the analogue to the constructive 9 discharge.  That claim cannot be brought into the 10 conciliation process until it exists. 11             So it's just the first component of the 12 process  what you're referring to, Your Honor, as 13 conciliation  moves quickly into a more adversarial 14 stages, and all of those stages presuppose that there is 15 a cause of action that exists, or a claim that exists. 16             And again, that's quite consistent with this 17 Court's default rule that  that the limitations period 18 is  is not triggered until the claim is fully formed. 19 And that's perfectly consistent with all of this Court's 20 Title VII timeliness cases. 21             If you look at, for instance, Evans, if you 22 look at Ricks.  At Ricks there was a fully formed cause 23 of action, and that's why the limitations period was 24 triggered, because the limitations period was triggered 25 by the denial of tenure.

1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I  I somehow feel

7

2 you've given up too much.  You can charge a

3 discriminatory termination, correct?  And that's the

4 employer making a decision that he is going to fire you

5 for reasons that are not legitimate; they're

6 discriminatory.

7             Isn't a constructive discharge that the

8 moment that the environment has gotten so hostile that

9 you feel overwhelmed and have to leave, isn't that the

10 discriminatory act as well?

11             MR. WOLFMAN:  Yes.  I think 

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that that discharge

13 itself is discriminatory because it  the employer has

14 proceeded in a pattern that has led you to that

15 decision?

16             MR. WOLFMAN:  That's exactly right.  And I

17 did not mean to be retreating from that position at all.

18 That's the two elements of the claim.  So the

19 resignation is part and parcel of the claim.  You have

20 the precipitating conduct, and you have the resignation.

21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what I'm saying.

22 I don't think  I think it's 

23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well 

24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You keep talking about

25 it as two separate elements.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. WOLFMAN:  Well, there are separate

8

2 elements but when the resignation occurs, the  the

3 claim is imputed to the employer.

4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the

5 precipitating 

6             MR. WOLFMAN:  It's imputed to the employer.

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  They're  they're not

8 always the same at the same point.  The employer could

9 have been discriminating against this employee for

10 years, and  and there's no additional discrimination

11 for an entire year.  But the employee has finally gotten

12 fed up with it, and after a year, during which the

13 employer has done nothing else discriminatory, he

14 decides I'm going to quit.  Now he'd still have a claim

15 for, you know, discriminatory provoking of  of the

16 quitting, but the  but the time period for the

17 discrimination and the time period for the quitting are

18 a year apart.

19             MR. WOLFMAN:  Well, that's certainly

20 possible, but again, that would  that would be the

21 case in many situations.

22             So, for instance, let's assume for a second

23 that there had been a discriminatory demotion on day

24 one, and then a year later there has been a

25 discriminatory termination with perhaps the exact same

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
9 1 motive.  No one disputes that both of those claims are 2 independently actionable, and no one disputes that their 3 limitations periods have a different trigger date. 4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It is an act of the 5 employer, and quitting is not an act of the employer. 6 The act of the employer  the unlawful act of the 7 employer is coercing the quitting.  So you have to find 8 an act on his part that coerces the quitting.  That's 9 quite different from the employer discharging the 10 person  11             MR. WOLFMAN:  There are  12             JUSTICE SCALIA:   for discriminatory  13             MR. WOLFMAN:   are some differences, but 14 the point is that the resignation, at the point of 15 resignation, when the cause of action accrues  and no 16 one here disputes that's when the cause of action 17 accrues  that conduct is imputed to the employer. 18             And it's not simply in the that's not  19 that's what this Court said in Suders, but it's not 20 simply  21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  For purpose of remedy, yes, 22 it is.  It's  23             MR. WOLFMAN:  Not simply for purposes of 24 remedy.  A cause of action for constructive discharge 25 will be dismissed if the person is still on the job and

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Wolfman 

3             MR. WOLFMAN:  This is part of the

4 affirmative case.

5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  If  you might be pulled in

6 two different directions here but you don't have to

7 accept what Justice Sotomayor is saying to win this

8 case; isn't that right?

9             In other words, one could say, yes, if you

10 had discriminatory acts language, that might point to

11 the last predicate discriminatory act as opposed to the

12 resignation, it might or it might not, but here that

13 language doesn't exist.  Here the language is

14 discriminatory matter.  That refers to the entire claim.

15 And when you refer to the entire claim, it's clear that

16 the resignation is part and parcel of that.

17             MR. WOLFMAN:  That is right.  I mean, we 

18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And it at least creates

19 ambiguity, such that the default rule would operate.

20             MR. WOLFMAN:  That  that 

21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you don't have not to go

22 to that 

23             MR. WOLFMAN:  I think that is true, that we

24 have argued this in two alternative ways.  One is simply

25 that the cause of action is not complete until there's a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1 resignation.  And we think the regulation is clear, but 2 even if it were not clear, the default rule kicks in and 3 we win. 4             But there's no question also that one of the 5 premises of the constructive discharge, constructive 6 eviction, constructive termination as in the Mac's Shell 7 case, there is no question that there is this idea that 8 when the relationship is ended, that is imputed to the 9 employer.  Some courts have focused more on that 10 rationale, and others have focused more on our principal 11 rationale, which is simply that the cause of action is 12 not complete until the resignation occurs. 13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why doesn't that mean 14 that it's within the employee's ability to stretch out 15 the time that he has?  Plus there could have been all 16 this discrimination and the employee stays on the job, 17 and then sometime down the road decides to quit. 18             MR. WOLFMAN:  Well, I think  I think that 19 is a concern in theory but not in practice.  In  in 20 reality, there are no such claims.  The claims would be 21 so weak that those constructive discharge claims are not 22 brought, and amicus cites no claims of that nature. 23             And let me just say that in this case  24 Court's decision in Bay Area Laundry, which applied the 25 default rule, the same  the same concern was raised
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that the limitations period, the trigger, would be

12

2 within the hands of the plaintiff.  And the Court said,

3 well, that may be so, but that's the way the statute was

4 written, the limitations period was written, and so be

5 it.

6             And the Court also added that the plaintiff

7 would have incentives to bring the claim as soon as

8 possible, and that would, of course, be true here.

9 It  if in fact the person could no longer take it,

10 they would want to leave.  They certainly wouldn't want

11 to bring a weak claim that came years after the

12 precipitating conduct.  That 

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, not  not

14 years but maybe several months.  I mean, you know, yes,

15 you can't take it anymore, but maybe you also need a

16 paycheck or  or, you know, you're going to be eligible

17 for the bonus in six weeks, you may as well at least

18 wait until then.

19             MR. WOLFMAN:  That is possible.  There

20 are  most cases, most of the constructive discharge

21 cases are bought  brought promptly.  Again, no one has

22 suggested here  and there are many constructive

23 discharge cases in the courts that there have been any

24 significant delay.

25             JUSTICE ALITO:  May I follow up on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Justice Kagan's question?  You were discussing the

13

2 possibility of deciding this case based on the

3 particular language of the regulation that applies here,

4 but your question presented is phrased much more

5 broadly.

6             You say under Federal employment

7 discrimination law, so I took that to mean that the rule

8 that you're advocating would be the same for public and

9 private sector employment.

10             MR. WOLFMAN:  I think it would be, Your

11 Honor, and I think so.  I think this  this Court's

12 decision would apply there, or at least give significant

13 guidance.  The private sector 

14             JUSTICE ALITO:  But there is  this matter

15 alleged to be discriminatory applies only to Federal

16 employment.

17             MR. WOLFMAN:  That is correct, but if I

18 might  if I might extend my answer.  The  the

19 private sector statute talks about an unlawful

20 employment of practice occurring.  And again, in light

21 of the default rule, even if there's ambiguity in  in

22 that phraseology, in light of the default rule, I think

23 it's very likely that you're going to have the same rule

24 apply in both situations.

25             Both of them seem to be describing the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1 claim, the cause of action, what it is that the employee 2 is complaining about. 3             JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't it true that outside 4 of the area of constructive discharge  and maybe 5 constructive discharge is different, and I think that's 6 really the thrust of your argument.  But outside of that 7 situation there must be an act of intentional 8 discrimination within the limitations period. 9             MR. WOLFMAN:  Well, that is likely correct, 10 if by that you are rejecting the notion  again, in my 11 discussion with Justice Sotomayor  that the 12 resignation is imputed to the employer.  And that is  13 that is the case, Your Honor  14             JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, but you're arguing 15 that there's  because there's this imputation, it's 16 different for constructive discharge. 17             MR. WOLFMAN:  Right. 18             JUSTICE ALITO:  But my  my question is 19 outside of that context, under Evans and Ricks and 20 Morgan and Ledbetter, there must be an act of 21 intentional discrimination within the limitations 22 period. 23             MR. WOLFMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  But let's be 24 clear about what those cases stand for.  Those cases do 25 reflect the facts as you just stated them.  But in each
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 of those cases, the trigger date was when the claim

15

2 first became actionable, and that's the exact same rule

3 we're asking for here.

4             And let me again extend my answer to you,

5 Justice Alito, which it is true that constructive

6 discharge could be unique in the sense you're suggesting

7 in the Title VII case, in the Title VII area.  But let's

8 remember that constructive eviction, constructive

9 business termination are treated the exact same way.

10             Your Honor, I  I do want to go back to

11 some of the practical implications.  As I  as I began

12 saying, the Tenth Circuit rule would inject unnecessary

13 complexity.  By contrast, the date of resignation is

14 easy to identify.  Most administrative claimants are

15 laypeople and are unlikely to be cognizant of the

16 lastact rule posited by the Tenth Circuit.

17             Reasonable intuition; that is, common sense,

18 will tell an employee that I cannot and certainly need

19 not bring my claim that I was forced out before I was

20 actually forced out.

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but I think

22 the government suggests that this is exactly a case

23 where it's not so easy to figure out when the

24 constructive termination was.

25             MR. WOLFMAN:  Well, when the resignation

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When the resignation

3 occurred.

4             MR. WOLFMAN:  Well, let me just say, Your

5 Honor, on that score, no one disputed that issue below,

6 and 

7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that doesn't

8 mean it was easy or  or hard.

9             MR. WOLFMAN:  No, Your Honor, I think it

10 does mean it was easy.  Every  the  all the parties

11 below, the administrative decisionmaker below, and the

12 Tenth Circuit below all held that  that  all

13 indicated that my client resigned on  on February 

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you know that

15 the case  you know, someone says this is ridiculous, I

16 can't take it anymore, I will resign in three months.  I

17 mean, what is the date of constructive termination then?

18             MR. WOLFMAN:  Well, our rule is that

19 definitive notice of resignation.  I think the

20 government agrees with that.  And so if you hand in a

21 letter or you state I am going to resign on Friday or

22 next Monday, that the trigger date would be the date 

23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No.  He says  I  I

24 interpreted the Chief Justice's question, maybe wrongly,

25 suppose he says in his own mind I can't take it anymore,

Alderson Reporting Company

1 three months from now I'm going to resign.

17

2             MR. WOLFMAN:  I think the trigger date would

3 be that date.  If he 

4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  When he resigns?

5             MR. WOLFMAN:  If he give notice 

6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  When he resigns?

7             MR. WOLFMAN:  His resignation is the  the

8 date that he says that because that's the date he gave

9 definitive notice 

10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no.  The date that he

11 says it to himself or the date that he does resign?

12             MR. WOLFMAN:  Oh.  Was the Chief Justice

13 positing something going on in the mind of the  of the

14 plaintiff?

15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  It's 

16 it's, you know, I think it's fairly common for people to

17 set a resignation date at some point in the future.  You

18 know, a schoolteacher will say as soon as this school

19 year is over, I'm out of here.

20             MR. WOLFMAN:  I think the date of

21 resignation is the date the teacher says that.

It's true that the person is still on the 7 job  8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  He's still getting paid. 9             MR. WOLFMAN:  That is correct, but  but 10 the person has resigned.

GANNON 11                  ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 12             MR. GANNON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 13 please the Court: 14             We agree with petitioner that the period for 15 initiating administrative consideration of a 16 constructivedischarge claim should begin when the 17 employee gives notice of resignation and not when the 18 employer commits the last act which might or might not 19 lead to that resignation. 20             And if I can turn to the colloquy that the 21 Chief Justice and Justice Scalia were just having with 22 my friend, we think that one of the virtues of this rule 23 is that it  it leads to the same result in both cases 24 of actual termination and cases of constructive 25 termination.

And it's probably a sensible rule 11 when you've got a 45day period. 12             Why don't you just change the regulation? 13 Why  14             MR.

The same question is going to present 19 itself with respect to  we think materially the same 20 question presents itself in the nonFederal sector where 21 the statute, as has already been discussed, refers to 22 when the allegedly unlawful employment practice 23 occurred.  And the EEOC has construed this portion of 24 the regulation as being effectively the same as the rule 25 in the nonFederal sector.

21 1             And the rule that we're asking for is this 2 Court's rule from Ricks.  It's the exact same rule. 3 This rule about being when definitive notice has  4 is  is given for a termination, Justice Scalia, you 5 were saying that when somebody says I quit, my last day 6 of work is three months from now, therefore, he hasn't 7 actually quit, that's Ricks. 8             The Court concluded that when the employer 9 there said you have been denied tenure, here is your 10 terminal contract, you will be working here for only one 11 more year, that the relevant date was the date on which 12 the operative decision had been made and it had been 13 communicated to the employee.  And so we think that the 14 rule should be the same for cases of actual discharge  15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But Ricks  16             MR. GANNON:   and constructive discharge. 17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Ricks alleged only 18 discrimination, not discriminatory  not constructive 19 discharge. 20             MR. GANNON:  That's true.  There is a 21 difference here. 22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's why I have a 23 problem with Ricks. 24             MR. GANNON:  Well  25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, I don't think

22 1 Ricks reads directly on what you're saying.  You  you 2 want to have an extension. 3             MR. GANNON:  We're trying to say that we 4 think that the same rule should apply to actual and 5 constructive discharges, and  and it is a rule that is 6 date of notification rather than date of separation. 7 And that's the rule that everybody applies on the 8 termination side; it's the rule that most of the courts 9 of appeals have applied in the  in the discharge side. 10             In the context of terminations, only 11 Justice Stevens suggested we should be using the actual 12 date of separation  13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But again, as Justice 14 Scalia points out, there's a difference between the 15 employee taking the action and the  and the employer 16 taking the action  17             MR. GANNON:  We agree that that  18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   and that distinguishes 19 Ricks. 20             MR. GANNON:  That does  that does make 21 this case different.  That's why this isn't on all fours 22 with Ricks.  And we do think that you would have to make 23 the decision that you want to apply the same rule across 24 to the constructive discharge context.  But we think the 25 reason you would do that is precisely because, as the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
23 1 Court acknowledged in Suders, a constructive discharge 2 requires both an employee's decision to resign and the 3 precipitating conduct.  And until both of those things 4 have happened, there is no constructive discharge. 5 Nobody can say I have been constructively discharged 6 until both of those things  7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me you're  8 you're loading the dice when  when you say it requires 9 both a decision to resign. 10             MR. GANNON:  Well, the  11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It  it requires a 12 resignation. 13             MR.

GANNON:  I was just quoting the Court's 17 decision in Suders, Justice Scalia. 18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, we weren't discussing 19 this very issue. 20             MR. GANNON:  Well, we were discussing  the 21 Court was discussing when a constructive discharge was 22 actionable, and that until  and so we do think it's 23 not just the decision in the employee's head.  We think 24 that the decision has to actually be communicated. 25             And so we  this is one reason why actually
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
24 1 this isn't  this wouldn't interfere as much with the 2 concern for counseling and conciliation that you were 3 discussing with my friend, which is that, as in cases of 4 termination, it could be that everybody knows that the 5 discharge has happened  it's a constructive discharge 6 or an actual discharge. 7             Everybody knows when the employer says, 8 you're fired, your last day of work is 14 days from 9 today, same thing when the employee says I'm giving my 10 notice, I quit, my last day is 14 days from today.  At 11 that point, whichever one has happened, the employee can 12 go and initiate counseling.  He may not be out the door 13 yet.  There may be a resolution that happens.  If he 14 does end up going out the door, counseling can happen 15 afterwards.  But he doesn't have to initiate counseling 16 before this happens.  There's a 45day  17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  He doesn't even have to 18 tell the employer why he's resigning. 19             MR. GANNON:  That's  that's  20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, all the employer 21 knows is you're  you're leaving at the end of this 22 term of  of school. 23             MR. GANNON:  And  24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or you're leaving in three 25 months.  That's all the employer knows.
Alderson Reporting Company

25 1             MR. GANNON:  And in our view, when  when 2  once he's given notice, I'm leaving in three months, 3 he then has 45 days to initiate the counseling with  4 with the agency counselor. 5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  He doesn't even have to 6 specify in his notice of quitting that he is quitting 7 because of discriminatory action.  He doesn't even have 8 to specify that. 9             MR. GANNON:  That  that is generally true 10 in the rest of the doctrine.  That has nothing to do 11 with the statute of limitations.  The EEOC will ask did 12 you tell your employer this is why you were resigning. 13 It will be something that will make it more difficult to 14 prove his case.  But we  15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think whether he has to 16 say that or not has a lot to do with  with when the 17 effective date ought to be, it seems to me. 18             MR. GANNON:  Well, we think that the reason 19 that this counts as being an act that should be imputed 20 to the employer is because it is forced by the 21 circumstances. 22             And we think that the doctrine itself is 23 selflimiting.  It limits the time period between when 24 the employee is able to suffer the consequence of what 25 the employer does to him, and then actually say I can't

GANNON:  And he has to do that within 15 45 days. 16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Within 45 days after  17 after when? 18             MR. GANNON:  After the date  19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  After his giving the 20 notice. 21             MR. GANNON:  After the date of notification. 22 Just as, like  as I was saying before, just as if it 23 were when the employer said, you're fired, your last day 24 of work is two weeks from today.  The clock is ticking. 25 That's the rule from Ricks.  We think it should be the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
27 1 same rule here, and we think that the reason why this is 2 called a constructive discharge is  is right there in 3 the phrase is  is pregnant with the idea that this is 4 an action that is being imputed to the employer. 5             And so although it is true that, unlike the 6 regular  the other claim of discrimination that 7 Justice Kennedy was mentioning before in Ricks, although 8 the employer has not actually done something necessarily 9 during the limitations period, the new act of 10 discrimination that we think is relevant here is the act 11 of the employee, and it's one that it's called a 12 constructive discharge precisely because it is not 13 actually a discharge.  It is instead an act of the 14 employee that is a resignation, but it is treated in law 15 as a legal fiction as if it is a discharge.  And we 16 think that that's  that squares the circle here.  And 17 we  18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, I would  I 19 would take the term constructive discharge to refer not 20 to the notice of quitting, but rather to the acts of the 21 employer that forced the quitting.  Even though the 22 person hasn't been discharged, you have constructively 23 discharged him because you've made his life miserable. 24             MR. GANNON:  I  I take the point, 25 Justice Scalia, but that's not enough to allege a

1 constructive discharge.  Until the employee actually

28

2 says I'm quitting, there has not been a constructive

3 discharge.  And so just because an  and this may be

4 what Justice Sotomayor was asking about before, but

5 we 

6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that  that works

7 the same way with eviction and other cases where you

8 have constructive, that the person has to act 

9             MR. GANNON:  That  that's correct.  And we

10 think the constructive eviction case is a very close

11 parallel.  And it shows that it's unusual but not

12 unprecedented that the plaintiff might be the one that

13 actually controls when the clock starts on the statute

14 of limitations.

15             And take the case of a constructive

16 eviction.  If somebody wants to bring a claim for the

17 breach of the covenant of warranty, that's a claim that

18 doesn't start until the tenant has been evicted, either

19 actually or constructively.  And so there's some choice

20 there of when  when 

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you mean,

22 constructively?  I don't understand.  Constructive of 

23 can't you bring a claim of constructive eviction while

25             MR. GANNON:  The  it  that's  that's

1 one version of constructive eviction.  Under the 

29

2 under the more classical version of constructive

3 eviction that came up in cases involving breach of the

4 covenant of warranty, the eviction would be constructive

5 because no one actually came and forced you out.

6 Instead, you just yielded to a superior claim of

7 paramount title, and that was your choice of when you

8 decided you weren't going to fight this anymore.

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But in fact you don't have

19 that there wasn't a constructive termination of a

21 somebody had actually walked out and allegized it to

30 1 but I'm not going to resign, I want to bring a claim for 2 constructive discharge, he couldn't do that.  He 3 could  he could say I've been discriminated against, 4 he could say there's been a hostile work environment, 5 but we do think, in disagreement with  with my friend, 6 the courtappointed amicus, we do think that these are 7 two different claims. 8             And the Court's opinion in Suders indicated 9 that there's a distinction between, for instance, the 10 underlying claim for hostile work environment and then 11 the more aggravated claim of a constructive discharge 12 for hostile work environment. 13             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do the predicate acts have 14 to be independently actionable or not? 15             MR. GANNON:  I don't think that they have to 16 be.  In most cases they will be.  We  we take that 17 point as probably going to be an unusual case where you 18 can bring a constructive discharge and nothing else. 19             The paradigmatic case is the one that the 20 Court was hypothesizing in Suders where you have a 21 hostile work environment where there are lots of things 22 that would have been actionable as discrimination, but 23 they wouldn't have necessarily have warranted quitting. 24             And then the employee says this is too much, 25 it's crossed the line, I'm quitting.  That second claim
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
31 1 we think is a new claim.  That's why the Court described 2 it as a second  as an additional  as a graver claim. 3             And in the discussion of amending the 4 complaints that  that the amicus invokes in the EEOC's 5 management directive, the reason why the court of 6 appeals and the amicus can say that the employee could 7 always just amend a timely complaint about the 8 underlying discrimination and add a claim for 9 constructive discharge is because the EEOC considers 10 this to be a new incident of discrimination.  But you 11 can actually amend a pending complaint because it's 12 related to what went before. 13             But the reason why you have to amend the 14 complaint is because it's a new claim.  It's not just 15 evidence that's relevant to damages for the underlying 16 discrimination.  There's  there's  the employee is 17 going to have to prove that he's made a decision to 18 resign, and also that the reason he did so was because 19 the situation was so intolerable that he  he was left 20 with no other choice.  But that  21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you explain the 22 difference between your position and the Petitioner's? 23 Why do you date the constructive discharge from, what is 24 it, December 16th? 25             MR. GANNON:  Yes.  And so I take it you're
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
32 1  you're talking about the factual question.  I don't 2 understand us as have a disagreement about the legal 3 question.  But with respect to applying the rule to this 4 case, the difference is that we think that the 5 settlement agreement that Petitioner signed on December 6 16th  which is the relevant clauses are reprinted at 7 pages 60 and 61 of the Joint Appendix  manifested his 8 unequivocal notice of his intention to resign.  We think 9 that satisfies the rule that both of us are talking 10 about here. 11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But he was given a 12 choice. 13             MR. GANNON:  We don't think  14             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  He was given a choice of 15 the  16             MR. GANNON:  That's  that is not the way 17 we think the agreement reads, Justice Ginsburg.  The 18 first two sentences of the clause that crosses the page 19 from 60 to 61 say Mr. Green agrees to retire from the 20 Postal Service no later than March 31st, and Mr. Green 21 agrees to take all necessary steps to effect his 22 retirement  23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But then read on. 24             MR.

GANNON:  We think he would have been in 15 breach of the agreement.  I'm not sure what would have 16 happened then, but the reason this sentence is in the 17 agreement is to take account of  of circumstances that 18 are no fault of his.

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why have the second

9 sentence there at all?  Why are you giving him an option

10 if he's  if he hasn't retired?

11             MR. GANNON:  We do not read this as giving

12 him an option.  We read this as responding 

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There was not reached by

14 the court below, correct?

15             MR. GANNON:  This was reached by the

16 district court.  It was an alternative holding by the

17 district court.  The Petitioner did not appeal that

18 alternative holding.  And so in the court of appeals,

19 the court was just considering the antecedent question

20 of whether we should only look to the act of the

21 employer or also the act of the employee.

22             And so this factual question didn't actually

23 come up before the court of appeals.  We noted in the

24 statement of facts in our court of appeals brief that

25 the agreement included his  the settlement agreement

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
35 1 included his agreement to retire, but otherwise we did 2 take the case on his premise, and the court of appeals 3 did not address this. 4             So we do think that it would be appropriate 5 for the Court here, if it agrees with us, if this 6 agreement is sufficiently clear, to say that Petitioner 7 will lose on the facts of this case. 8             If you want to remand and have the court of 9 appeals consider whether the district court was correct 10 in reaching that, that would also be appropriate.  But 11 we think that this wouldn't be that different from what 12 the Court did in Irwin where in Irwin the Court said, 13 well, the court of appeals was wrong about finding that 14 there was no possibility of equitable tolling; 15 nevertheless, there is no way he will ever satisfy 16 equitable tolling on the facts of this case, so he 17 loses. 18             And I do think that one final thing I would 19 like to say is that the Court should be able to take 20 some comfort from the realworld evidence that we have. 21 It's not much.  We don't have evidence of cases from the 22 five circuits that have adopted a version of the notice 23 of resignation rule between 1987 and 2000 that indicates 24 that employers are being besieged with stale 25 discrimination claims that are being revived by
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
36 1 employees' attempts to quit some months or years after 2 the fact.  And so we think that it's doesn't present 3 those concerns. 4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Frankly, I'm a little 5 less moved by that because, from my personal experience, 6 those stale claims generally don't make it past a motion 7 to dismiss. 8             MR. GANNON:  Well, that  that  9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Very few of them are 10 appealed because if they're really that stale, those 11 constructive discharge claims are usually thrown out. 12             MR. GANNON:  Well, I  13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The case is litigated on 14 other grounds. 15             MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that's right, but 16  and I think that  but it's also the case that in 17 many cases, in fact in most cases, there isn't going to 18 be very much time between these two dates, and therefore 19 it usually isn't going to be that dispositive. 20             In this case, we think that the things 21 happened on the same day.  Even under Petitioner's 22 approach, he had some weeks to make his decision.  But 23 the reason why he wasn't prejudiced by being able to 24 take some weeks to make his decision is precisely 25 because he was using annual leave, he wasn't suffering

1 the consequences of a hostile work environment, he

37

2 hadn't taken the pay cut, he hadn't had to move 400

3 miles away, and so this was an unusual case where he

4 would have been able to take that much time.

5             And so it looks like, as in  in

6 practicality's sake, that  that it hasn't made a big

7 difference.  And that's why we think it would be useful

8 for the Court to say this is effectively the Ricks rule.

9 It should apply to both cases of actual and cases of

10 constructive termination.

11             If there are no further questions, we would

12 urge the Court to affirm.

15          ORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE M.A. CARROLL

16             AS COURTAPPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE

17              IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW

18             MS. CARROLL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19 please the Court:

20             We agree that the Ricks rule should apply

21 here as it does to any other kind of claim under Title

22 VII, and like any other kind of claim under Title VII, a

23 constructive discharge claim has to challenge actionable

24 conduct by the employer.

25             In applying the EEOC's regulation here, we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 have to ask, what was that actionable conduct, that

38

2 matter alleged to be discriminatory, and when did it

3 occur.

4             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, you just sort of made

5 those two synonymous.  But they don't have to be

6 synonymous.  A matter might mean the claim, not the

7 particular discriminatory conduct that's the predicate

8 for the claim.

9             MS. CARROLL:  Justice Kagan, I think that

10 the EEOC has, by equating the Federal sector provision

11 with the private sector provision, has suggested that

12 both of these provisions do focus on the alleged

13 unlawful employment practice.  In addition when the EEOC

14 promulgated this rule in its current form, it explained

15 that this rule, quote, continued the rule that had

16 applied under the prior version which used the language

17 alleged discriminatory event.

18             So I don't think the inclusion of the word

19 "matter" by itself makes a difference.  After all, it

20 doesn't just say matter.  It says matter alleged to be

21 discriminatory, and we think that has to be read as a

22 whole to clearly focus on what is it that is the target

23 of the claim.

24             And that language is  it does not become

25 ambiguous just because it might be challenging to apply

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
39 1 it in a particular fact pattern.  I think this Court's 2 decision in Morgan is an excellent example of that where 3 the Court said we have a clear rule that requires us to 4 identify what was the alleged unlawful employment 5 practice and when did it occur, and that's the analysis 6 here. 7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, this is an unusual 8 kind of claim, and it's an unusual kind of claim because 9 there are predicate acts and then there is also a 10 resignation which clearly has to occur before the suit 11 can be brought.  And when there is this, you know, this 12 composite set of things that has to go on before a suit, 13 it seems to me that it's at least approaching the kind 14 of possible ambiguous  ambiguous stage to say, yeah, 15 that's a matter, that's a practice that both of those 16 things have to be part of it. 17             MS. CARROLL:  I think that that's difficult 18 to reconcile with how Morgan treated the word 19 "practice."  Always bearing in mind, as the Court has 20 explained in a case like Graham County, for instance, 21 the kind of ambiguity that triggers resort to a default 22 accrual rule is ambiguity in the literal text of the 23 provision.  There it was unclear whether a particular 24 limitations period even applied and the Court said, 25 literal text is ambiguous, there are clues that point in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
40 1 one direction, we think this default rule points in the 2 same direction. 3             But the Court hasn't applied that background 4 rule to override language that's  that otherwise 5 clearly calls for an analysis of, in this case, what is 6 it that the plaintiff alleged to be discriminatory. 7             Here, Mr. Green alleged a discrete act of 8 retaliation that he says occurred in December of 2009. 9 He alleges no repeated or cumulative acts of 10 discrimination subsequent to that date and so  11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about that he hasn't 12 got a claim?  He can't even  you can't come to court 13 with a claim for constructive discharge until you've 14 said I'm discharged.  So he  you're suggesting that 15 the time runs from a time when he does not yet have a 16 ripe claim. 17             MS. CARROLL:  Well, we does not have a ripe 18 claim for constructive discharge.  He would have a ripe 19 claim for discrimination or retaliation to challenge the 20 underlying predicate acts, and in this position  21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But then are you saying 22 that constructive discharge will  will lead to a cause 23 of action only when it is so close to the precipitating 24 event that they are almost contemporaneous? 25             MS. CARROLL:  I'm not 100 percent sure I
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 followed the question, but let me 

41

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  When, under your view,

3 when is there a constructive discharge that itself leads

4 to triggering the statute of limitations?

5             MS. CARROLL:  I think in a constructive

6 discharge case  and to be clear, that label can be

7 applied to a range of different fact patterns  it will

8 often be the case that the predicate conduct that

9 precipitates the resignation is itself alleged to be

10 discriminatory.  Take the facts of Suders, for instance,

11 where there was an ongoing pattern of harassing

12 behavior.  Individual acts contributing to that hostile

13 work environment had occurred leading up to and indeed

14 on I believe the very day of the resignation.  There, I

15 think it is, as Your Honor suggests, not going to matter

16 at all which rule the Court were to adopt in this case.

17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  They're almost

18 contemporaneous.

19             MS. CARROLL:  They would be contemporaneous.

20 But in a case like this, it's much clearer to see the

21 conceptual distinction between Mr. Green's own

22 individual independent decision to resign and his

23 employer's predicate discriminatory conduct.  And in

24 Suders, the Court made very clear that those were two

25 distinct components of a constructivedischarge claim.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
42 1             And I think, you know, the Petitioner and 2 the government's position asks the Court to extend the 3 legal fiction that equates constructive discharge. 4             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, the matter complained 5 of here is a constructive discharge.  In a tort suit or 6 many the matter complained of is negligent behavior 7 leading to an injury.  I take it in the tort suit the 8 statute of limitations doesn't begin to run until there 9 is harm. 10             MS. CARROLL:  I think that's generally true 11 of tort suits  12             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  If that's 13 generally true in a tort suit, and my guess is in a 14 contract suit for breach of contract, if the contracting 15 party sent the ships out and you knew that it wouldn't 16 be delivered, it's not actionable until it isn't 17 delivered and I guess there are ways around that, but my 18 point is generally in the law where the matter 19 complained of is a certain kind of incident in the 20 world, negligence leading to harm, action of a 21 discriminatory, et cetera, nature that leads to a 22 discharge, normally the statute of limitations begins to 23 run when the harm occurs. 24             Now why should it be any different here? 25             MS. CARROLL:  In this case, the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
43 1 discrimination, the retaliation I should say, that was 2 challenged was the forcing  forcing of Mr. Green into 3 the settlement agreement in December.  He alleges that 4 that was retaliatory and he was harmed by that at that 5 time, and he could have promptly initiated counseling on 6 that complaint. 7             Now, it is true that, as a consequence of 8 that discriminatory retaliatory conduct, the stakes got 9 higher for him at a later point when he decided  10             JUSTICE BREYER:  Of course, he could have, 11 but we're talking about only the constructive discharge 12 part.  I mean, sometimes defendants do seven bad things 13 at once, or at least allegedly bad. 14             MS. CARROLL:  That's correct, but  15             JUSTICE BREYER:  And we're only talking 16 about one of them, the one that we're talking about is 17 the constructivedischarge claim. 18             So I go back to my question about 19 negligence, because that was the first course I took in 20 law school so I remember that, but the  the fact is 21 why should we treat this any differently? 22             MS. CARROLL:  So, in general, we don't this 23 should be analyzed any differently than any other kind 24 of claim, which is that we have to identify what is the 25 alleged unlawful practice and when did it occur.  Why is
Alderson Reporting Company

1 that?  Because 

Official

44

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  Because you have to, as you

3 said, in the a tort case it's not just that the person

4 behaved negligently, but that negligence had to result

5 in a harm.

6             MS. CARROLL:  And 

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  So I'm just  that's the

8 only simpleminded analogy I'm drawing and I wonder why

9 it doesn't work.

10             MS. CARROLL:  I think it does work because

11 in this case there was retaliation alleged in December

12 that harmed Mr. Green at that time.  He later suffered a

13 more painful consequence, which under Ricks does not

14 trigger a new construct  a new statute of limitations.

15             But I want to go back 

16             JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose there was evidence

17 that the employer had a continuing intent to force

18 Mr. Green's resignation.  So you've got emails that say,

19 Mr. Green is causing trouble for us by charging us with

20 discrimination, we're going to do A, B, C, D and E to

21 force him to retire.  And then on the day when he quits

22 there is another email that says, Hallelujah, we've

23 achieved our objective, he's retired.

24             Now when would it run in that situation?

25             MS. CARROLL:  I think if 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1             JUSTICE BREYER:  Wouldn't it run from the 2 date of discharge because there would be an intent at  3 as of that date? 4             MS. CARROLL:  But if I'm understanding the 5 hypothetical correctly, that sounds to me like a case 6 that would be analyzed under the Court's decision in 7 Morgan, where you have an environment of hostility that 8 is composed of many individual acts, some of which might 9 not be independently actionable in and of themselves, 10 joined with a discriminatory  11             JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me clarify it.  So 12 nothing more is done.  There are all these acts up to a 13 certain point, and then 45 days, 50 days pass and the 14 employee resigns, but the employer has all along had the 15 intention of forcing the resignation.  So on the date of 16 the resignation the employer intends to cause a 17 discharge for discriminatory reason. 18             MS. CARROLL:  I still think Morgan answers 19 that question because Morgan says there has to be an act 20 contributing to the hostile work environment that occurs 21 within the 40  within the charging period.  And that's 22 the exact same analysis whether on the 46th day the 23 employee decides that's it, I quit, or if he simply 24 decides that's it, I'm finally going to speak up about 25 this hostile work environment that's being been going
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1 on.  It has nothing to do with constructive discharge. 2             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the  now, I'm 3 getting this more clearly because your response to my 4 question, which is now relevant to this too, is, look, 5 the plaintiff was hurt on the very day that last act was 6 performed, indeed he suffered because he saw the act 7 being performed, and that was one of the things that led 8 him later to quit. 9             So let's count that as the injury.  And 10 let's count the whole thing complete as of that time. 11 That's basically the argument for your side, I think. 12             And now the argument against you is that's 13 going to be a nightmare.  Because there will be in fact 14 a whole range of acts, a whole series in many cases and 15 will then, in order to run the statute of limitations, 16 have to get into the question of which of those acts  17 maybe there were some he didn't know about  which of 18 those acts actually did produce harm and which did not. 19 And he just really won't know when to bring his lawsuit 20 as compared with the comparatively simple thing:  He 21 quits. 22             MS. CARROLL:  Right, I understand that 23 contention, but I think that the socalled difficulty is 24 no different than the difficulty, socalled, that would 25 arise in a hostile work environment case where there was
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 no resignation.  You would still have to 

47

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, that's true.

3             MS. CARROLL:   figure out what  were

4 there acts within the 45day period that contributed to

5 the environment.  Maybe that's going to be difficult on

6 some facts, but that's a result of this Court's decision

7 in Morgan, again, nothing to do with constructive

8 discharge.

9             Now, with respect to 

10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  There's something more than

11 just simplicity, which is, you know, suppose you had a

12 case where somebody is first demoted and then somebody

13 is fired.  You would never say, oh, he was demoted.  He

14 suffered the injury then, it just raised the stakes.

15 You would say, no, there's two independent things and

16 now he can bring a termination claim.

17             MS. CARROLL:  That's right.

18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And the power of the

19 constructivedischarge claim is to say the exact same

20 thing really has happened here, that once you lose the

21 job, it's more than the stakes have been raised.  It's

22 that there is a separate injury that then becomes

23 legally actionable.

24             MS. CARROLL:  Well, the analysis when there

25 is a demotion followed by a termination is not simply

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that there's been a second separate injury, but that

48

2 there's been a second separate violation of Title VII by

3 the employer.  That's why it is a discrete unlawful

4 employment action triggering a fresh limitations period.

5             In constructive discharge, you know, the

6 analysis that the second separate event, the employee's

7 decision to resign is itself the actionable thing, that

8 is the analysis that the court of appeals had applied in

9 Suders.  In Suders the question was:  Do we treat

10 constructive discharge as a tangible employment action

11 for purposes of determining vicarious liability.  The

12 Third Circuit said, well, yes, we treat these as

13 equivalents for all intents and purposes, so naturally,

14 when there's a constructive discharge, that means

15 there's been a tangible employment action.

16             This Court rejected that analysis and said,

17 no, the legal fiction does not extend that far.  To be

18 sure, the Court says, we treat those two the same for

19 remedial purposes in the sense that an employee who has

20 been constructively discharged can recover for that to

21 the same degree and for the same extent as if he or she

22 had been actually discharged.

23             That makes sense because you have this

24 background duty to mitigate and, in the circumstance of

25 a constructive discharge, we don't think the employee

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
49 1 should be tagged with the consequences of having, you 2 know, socalled failed to mitigate damages.  But 3 that's  that's the purpose of the legal fiction  4             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if we're going to say, 5 yes, these are different and for some purposes we're 6 going to look to the fiction and for other purposes 7 we're not going to look to the fiction, it seems to me 8 as though here it makes sense to take account of the 9 fiction in the sense that the person cannot bring a 10 claim until the resignation has happened. 11             So that's the kind of paradigmatic case in 12 which, boy, there is something really powerful pushing 13 that, yes, you can  you should recognize the 14 constructive discharge as a discharge in this case. 15             MS. CARROLL:  But the limitations period 16 here does not run from the accrual of the claim, it runs 17 from the time of the matter alleged to be 18 discriminatory, the unlawful employment action.  And as 19 this Court explained in Suders, the constructive 20 discharge entails both predicate discrimination  and 21 we do think it has to be independently actionable.  We 22 think the Court recognized that when it said in Suders 23 that for Ms. Suders to prove her hostile work 24 environment claim was quoting necessary predicate to her 25 constructive discharge claim, and that's also the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
50 1 uniform holding in the courts of appeals.  There has to 2 be predicate, unlawful conduct by the employer and a 3 subsequent decision by the employee to resign. 4             When you have a provision that singles out 5 as the start of the limitations period one of those two 6 components, then the fact that the claim hasn't accrued 7 yet is not something that the Court can rely on to 8 override that clear language.  I think this Court's 9 decision in Pillsbury is a really excellent example of 10 that, where under the Longshoremen's Act, there was a 11 provision that ran from the time of injury.  And the 12 plaintiffs pointed out, well, that we can't actually 13 recover compensation for our injury until a disability 14 has manifested, so we should say that we should 15 interpret injury to mean disability.  And the Court 16 said, well, no.  I mean, it's true that that will run 17 the limitation period before the claim can accrue, but 18 the language says what it says. 19             For what it's worth here, I don't think that 20 this reading is actually going to cut off claims except 21 in cases of, you know, real lack of diligence, because 22 here, it's not the case that there's no claim available 23 after the initial act of discrimination by the employer, 24 there is a claim available, the employee can initiate 25 counseling on that, and as a matter of the conciliation
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
51 1 policy, he or she ought to do that promptly in order to 2 bring about the best chance of a prompt and informal 3 reconciliation. 4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The language we're focusing 5 on here is the language of a regulation.  What statutory 6 language does that regulation implement? 7             MS. CARROLL:  The cause of action for 8 Federal employees in 2000e16(c), if I have that right, 9 requires that, it extends a cause of action to Federal 10 employees who have been aggrieved by the final decision 11 of an agency that has been produced through this 12 administrative process that is all a design of  of 13 EEOC regulations. 14             So there, the  unlike in the private 15 sector provision, the charging period here is purely a 16 creature of the regulation.  The time limit that exists 17 in the statute on the Federal sector side is only the 18 time limit for bringing the lawsuit once you have been 19 aggrieved by the final agency decision. 20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You say this isn't 21 going to be a problem much.  I think it's going to be a 22 problem a lot of times.  People are in jobs and they're, 23 you know, suffering this particular type of adverse work 24 environment or discrimination, but quitting your job is 25 a very big deal.  I think you have to plan out when
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
52 1 that's going to be, and just because you can't take it 2 anymore doesn't mean that you could quit work right 3 away. 4             MS. CARROLL:  But this rule doesn't require 5 you to quit in order to be able to raise and seek 6 resolution. 7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, sure, it doesn't 8 require you to quit, it just requires you to tell your 9 boss, you know, I can't take this anymore.  And now I've 10 got to conciliate with you, but, you know, it creates 11 complications in the workforce if you raise that type of 12 issue. 13             MS. CARROLL:  It can.  I mean, to be clear, 14 the EEOC regulations require that this must be all done 15 anonymously until the complaining employee says 16 actually, please go ahead and tell my employer so that 17 we can try to pursue alternative  18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suspect most 19 employers could figure out who is complaining in these 20 types of situations. 21             MS. CARROLL:  Well, be that as it may, I 22 think the policy underlying this provision is the 23 recognition that the purpose of all of this is to try to 24 prevent discrimination and to correct it as soon as it 25 has occurred.  It is unquestionably a very short
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
53 1 provision, and the Court recognized in Morgan that this 2 very short provision exists because of the recognition 3 that we want these sorts of alleged discriminatory, 4 retaliatory circumstances to be addressed right away. 5 There are safeguards built in.  This provision, I think 6 probably unique among statutes of limitations that I 7 know of, actually mandates that it be extended if, for 8 example, the employee didn't know about the time limit 9 or didn't know  didn't have a reasonable basis to 10 suspect discrimination. 11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What  what is your 12 position on the government's stance? 13             MS. CARROLL:  On the legal question or the 14 factual  15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Factual question. 16             MS. CARROLL:  We haven't taken a position on 17 that because the court of appeals didn't  didn't find 18 it necessary to do so.  You know, we  19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think it's an 20 example of the difficulty of trying to figure out when 21 the discrimination occurred if you have this lastact 22 kind of thing. 23             MS. CARROLL:  Well, to the contrary, I think 24 their dispute has a risen because they're trying to 25 apply the dateofresignation rule and are finding it
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
54 1 difficult to agree on when that resignation occurred. 2             As I  as I said earlier, I think in our  3 under the rule that the court of appeals adopted in this 4 case, we think it asks the Court or the agency to engage 5 in precisely the same inquiry that it would have to do 6 whether  even if there had not been a constructive 7 discharge.  It's still, in every case, about identifying 8 what is the alleged violation of the statute. 9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you do with 10 Suders that seemed to distinguish two things; one was 11 the hostile environment, and the second was the 12 constructive discharge.  And the Court said that that  13 that the hostile environment is a lesser included 14 component of the more serious constructivedischarge 15 claim. 16             MS. CARROLL:  May I respond? 17             I think Suders recognized that Ms. Suders 18 had to prove up both pieces.  She had to prove unlawful 19 conduct by the employer, namely, a severe and pervasive 20 change in the terms and conditions of her employment 21 amounting to a hostile work environment, and she had to 22 meet the constructive discharge standard.  And if the 23 Court's intent in saying so had been to equate 24 constructive discharge with actual discharge for all 25 intents and purposes, then I don't see how the Court
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
55 1 could have come to the conclusion that the affirmative 2 defense is  is ever available. 3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 4             Mr. Wolfman, four minutes. 5            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN 6                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 7             MR. WOLFMAN:  Your Honor, if I might, I 8 would like to begin where we ended.  Suders considered 9 and then recognized a claim for constructive discharge, 10 what we would call in the old days a cause of action. 11 At pages 142 and 143, the Court said it was considering 12 whether a claim for constructive discharge lies under 13 Title VII. 14             And then it  it holds, we agree with the 15 lower courts and the EEOC that Title VII encompasses 16 employer liability for constructive discharge.  Not 17 simply damage enhancing, but liability for constructive 18 discharge. 19             I do want to turn to, Mr. Chief Justice, 20 your question about the government's position on the 21 date of resignation.  It is not entirely correct that 22 the Tenth Circuit did not address this.  At Petition 23 Appendix 2A, here's what the Tenth Circuit said:  That 24 shortly after being put on leave he signed a settlement 25 agreement under which he would choose either to retire

1 or to work in a position that paid much less and was

56

2 about 300 miles away.  That was the premise on which

3 the 

4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  That's true,

5 and that's why I thought 

6             MR. WOLFMAN:  Yes.

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   that was an open

8 question.  But the government, Mr. Gannon says that in

9 fact the district court said that you chose to retire

10 on  in December, and you didn't appeal that finding by

11 the district court.

12             MR. WOLFMAN:  That is not correct.  The

13 district court was of two minds on the question.  At one

14 point it  it indicated that his  his agreement was a

15 resignation.  At another point  and this is in other

16 reply brief  the district court said the exact

17 opposite.  It said what the Tenth Circuit said.  And the

18 district court opinion, its legal ruling is not premised

19 on that  what the government is saying is a finding.

20             Now, let me also say that the EEO decision

21 in this case, that is the Postal Service itself said 

22 this is at the Joint Appendix 23  a fair reading of

23 the agreement reveals that he was given the choice to

24 retire or to report to a new job, and was allowed to

25 continue his career.

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  What is your response to

3 her  I think she's saying in most of these cases there

4 is a hostile work environment.  Where there is a hostile

5 work environment you have 45 days from the last act, and

6 so what we should do is look at this injury as simply

7 one more injury caused by a hostile work environment.

8 And just as you don't look at the date of injury there,

9 you look to the environment, et cetera, we so do the

10 same thing here.  It's simpler, et cetera.

11             MR. WOLFMAN:  Right.  There are two answers

12 to that, Justice Breyer.  First of all, I do want to

13 challenge the premise of the seven illustrative cases

14 cited in Suders, illustrative for constructive

15 discharge.  Three of them were standalone constructive

16 discharges, untethered to any other claim; that's

17 number 1.

18             Number 2, even if you have what this Court

19 in Suders called a subset of constructive discharge

20 cases, that is one arising out of a hostile work

21 environment, they are still distinct claims.  That's

22 really the point of Suders.  They're distinct claims,

23 they're separately actionable, and we know they're

24 separately actionable because the constructivedischarge

25 claim is not actionable until resignation.
