1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:06 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in case 06-1181, Dada v. Mukasey. 5 Mr. Meade. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. MEADE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 9 please the Court: 10 Congress has provided that certain aliens, 11 including those with good moral character, are eligible 12 for voluntary departure. Congress has also provided 13 that all aliens may file one motion to reopen raising 14 new facts within 90 days. 15 The question is how to reconcile these two 16 provisions. The parties agree on two key points: 17 First, the Government agrees that the statute can be 18 read to preserve motions to reopen for voluntary 19 departure recipients. Second, the Government agrees 20 that such aliens can file a motion to reopen; and if the 21 immigration official happens to act quickly enough, the 22 alien will receive a ruling. But, under the 23 Government's view, if the official does not act quickly 24 enough, the alien is denied an adjudication. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we consider that in
3

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 your case, given that the application to reopen was made 2 when there were only two days left to run for the 3 termination of the voluntary departure time -- in other 4 words, it was your delay, not the Government's, that 5 made it impossible to decide this in the requisite time? 6 MR. MEADE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and I 7 have two responses, one relating to this particular case 8 as well as the cases in general. 9 But, as to this particular case, Mr. Dada 10 found new counsel, which took a week; and in the 11 remaining time he prepared a motion to reopen with 80 12 pages of exhibits including affidavits, five letters, 13 medical documents, financial records including tax 14 returns. And that's why it took an additional 15 two-and-a-half weeks to do the motion to reopen. 16 But, as a general matter, aliens file at 17 different periods during the period. For example, in 18 the Eleventh Circuit case of Ugokwe the alien filed with 19 30 days left in the period, and the Government, the 20 agency, didn't act in time. 21 But what happens in the agency is that 22 motions to reopen are, in fact, decided relatively 23 quickly -- just not quickly enough. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many of those 25 are -- are granted?

1 MR. MEADE: How many -2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What percentage of 3 motions to reopen are granted in favor of the alien? 4 MR. MEADE: We've looked for that statistic, 5 and we have not been able to find the statistic. 6 However, there are numerous cases presenting very 7 sympathetic facts which show grants of motions to 8 reopen. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how many -- do 10 you know how many are filed on an annual basis? 11 MR. MEADE: Yes, I do. As a general matter, 12 there are 10,000 motions to reopen filed, but that's for 13 all aliens, for all removal proceedings. Since 14 voluntary departure is roughly 10 percent of all 15 removals, we estimate that'S roughly a thousand motions 16 to reopen filed by voluntary departure recipients. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there would be no 18 reason not to file one of these if you were subject to 19 voluntary -- if you elected voluntary departure, and it 20 extended your time to stay, right? Seemingly, everybody 21 would file one of these if we rule in your favor. 22 MR. MEADE: Not necessarily. There are -23 the statute governs when a motion to reopen is proper, 24 and the Attorney General determined, even under the 25 previous statutory scheme --

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're dealing with 2 people who have already broken the law. So you're 3 saying they are likely to follow the statute that says 4 only file a motion to reopen under these circumstances? 5 MR. MEADE: Well, two responses: First, 6 there are sanctions for frivolous filing under the 7 immigration proceedings. 8 Second, the Attorney General, under the old 9 regime that wasn't tightened -- the Attorney General 10 concluded that there was no pattern of abuse of motions 11 to reopen. 12 And, third, going forward, this is not a 13 risk because -14 JUSTICE ALITO: If an alien has not been 15 diligently pursuing his or her rights, you would argue 16 the person was still entitled to equitable tolling if 17 the alien files a motion to reopen? 18 MR. MEADE: When you say that they're not 19 diligently pursuing their rights, I am not clear -20 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that generally a 21 requirement for equitable tolling: A person has to have 22 been diligently pursuing his rights? 23 MR. MEADE: Generally, yes. 24 JUSTICE ALITO: But you don't advocate the 25 adoption of that here. You say if you file a petition
6

1 -- a motion to reopen, you get automatic equitable 2 tolling. 3 MR. MEADE: Yes. Not necessarily equitable 4 tolling, but, yes, automatic tolling under the statute. 5 But to show quickly -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't -- why isn't it 7 fair to say: You have the short time frame by statute 8 to leave the country if you've left in voluntary 9 departure. Yet, the Government has provided reopening 10 for all aliens. Okay. 11 Why isn't it reasonable to say that, by 12 asking for reopening when you've gotten permission to 13 voluntarily depart within "x" days, you are 14 relinquishing your voluntary departure status? 15 MR. MEADE: That -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that a perfect 17 reconciliation of the two? 18 MR. MEADE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. That's 19 the option that the Government is proposing 20 prospectively. It is also something that my client 21 requested at every stage of the proceedings before the 22 Board, before the Fifth Circuit, and the cert petition, 23 and in our opening brief. That is one way to reconcile 24 the two statutory provisions which the Government is 25 proposing on an ongoing basis that will not apply to our
7

1 client. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you raised the 3 question, as I remember, when you put it in the cert 4 petition. The Government advised against granting on 5 that question and limiting it to the question of having 6 it -- having it both ways, keeping your voluntary 7 departure and moving to reopen. 8 MR. MEADE: Yes, that's correct, Justice 9 Ginsburg. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, another way 11 to reconcile the two that I think would be beneficial to 12 your client, but I'm not sure it's open to us, is to 13 address the Government's view that, when you voluntarily 14 depart, your motion to reopen is automatically 15 withdrawn. That is, as I gather, set forth only in a 16 regulation and not the statute. 17 Now, it seems to me that if I were -- if I 18 thought it important to reconcile the two, I would be 19 much more concerned about that interpretation -- that 20 the motion to reopen is automatically withdrawn -- than 21 I would suggest we start incorporating equitable tolling 22 rules and all of that. 23 But, I take it, the vulnerability of that 24 regulation is probably beyond -- beyond debate. 25 MR. MEADE: Well, that regulation is subject
8

1 to litigation. That would be another way to solve the 2 problem as you suggest. It would be -3 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it wasn't directly 4 challenged here, was it? 5 MR. MEADE: Excuse me? 6 JUSTICE SOUTER: That regulation was not 7 directly challenged in this case? 8 MR. MEADE: It was not directly challenged 9 because the Fifth Circuit is one of the circuits that 10 says that the motion -- that regulation is valid. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we don't 12 address it here, there's going to be another case in a 13 year or 18 months where that's going to be raised? 14 MR. MEADE: Your Honor, as to voluntary 15 departure recipients, this Court can construe the 16 statute to avoid the conflict here. And, moving 17 forward, the Government has a proposed solution which, 18 if adopted, will resolve the question on an ongoing 19 basis. 20 Some of the examples of the facts that arise 21 in motions to reopen are seen in various cases. For 22 example, a child newly diagnosed with mental 23 disabilities as in the Azarte case in the Ninth Circuit, 24 a parent newly diagnosed with health problems as in the 25 BIA case of Diaz Mucho --

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in all these 2 cases, if you think you have a good case on the motion 3 to reopen, all you have to do is give up the benefits 4 that you have availed yourself under voluntary 5 departure, and then the motion to reopen is not 6 automatically withdrawn. 7 MR. MEADE: With respect, that's not an 8 option to our client. Our client tried to do that, but 9 was not permitted. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I mean he -- you 11 should not elect voluntary departure in the first place. 12 MR. MEADE: Well, the problem is because of 13 the very nature of the motion to reopen. A motion to 14 reopen, by its very nature, is based on changed 15 circumstances, circumstances that were not available at 16 the original time of the hearing. 17 So a person could enter and accept voluntary 18 departure at the time of the hearing and, because of 19 circumstances that change, that, by definition, he or 20 she could not have known about, is then in a bind when 21 he wants to -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What were those 23 circumstances here? 24 MR. MEADE: The circumstances here is that 25 previous counsel had failed to submit an application and
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 supporting evidence. And under the BIA case law that's 2 a proper vehicle for a motion to reopen. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it existed? You're 4 not saying something that came up later? What was the 5 ground that the, in this case, that wasn't brought up by 6 the first counsel? 7 MR. MEADE: It was a file for adjustment of 8 status, an application for adjustment of status and 9 supporting documents, as well as the supporting evidence 10 showing that this was a bona fide marriage. And the BIA 11 has numerous cases which says that a motion to reopen of 12 this type is a valid motion to reopen. 13 Now, of course, the agency didn't rule on 14 whether the facts did or not -- did or did not need a 15 motion to reopen. So that question isn't before the 16 Court. But the other cases show the various kinds of 17 tracks that come up to establish a motion to reopen and 18 why it's an important part of the immigration process. 19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Meade, why was your 20 client not allowed to withdraw the voluntary departure 21 option, withdraw from it? 22 MR. MEADE: Justice Souter, that's unclear. 23 The agency didn't ask -- didn't answer that in the first 24 instance. There has never been a reason given 25 throughout the entire litigation, and now there is some
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 irony -2 JUSTICE SOUTER: So all we have on the 3 record is just an IJ's determination that he would not 4 accept it? 5 MR. MEADE: Well, it wasn't the IJ. It was 6 before the Board. It was presented to the Board, and 7 the Board's order only said he is ineligible for this 8 relief because he has overstayed the voluntary departure 9 period. But there is some irony -10 JUSTICE SOUTER: But at the time he filed, 11 he had not overstayed, because he filed on Friday 12 afternoon, right? 13 MR. MEADE: Yes. 14 JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so maybe the point is 15 we didn't have time to rule on it simply because he 16 filed it on Friday afternoon and he had to leave on 17 Sunday, and therefore, we should not take that as a 18 determination that had he filed in time for timely 19 action by the court he would have been denied. 20 MR. MEADE: The agency has never given a 21 reason for why they did not accept the withdrawal, 22 although there is some irony in the fact that the 23 proposed solution going forward would give aliens 24 exactly what my client asked for if the agency -25 JUSTICE ALITO: If the voluntary withdrawal
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 had been withdrawn successfully, he would then have been 2 subject to the alternate order of removal? 3 MR. MEADE: That's correct, Your Honor. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: And he could have been 5 removed immediately? 6 MR. MEADE: That's correct. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: And that would have mooted 8 the motion to reopen, wouldn't it? 9 MR. MEADE: It wouldn't have mooted the 10 motion to reopen. Motions to reopen are available to 11 all aliens subject to a final order, including criminal 12 aliens, including some accused of terrorism. 13 JUSTICE ALITO: Would it remain pending once 14 he had left the United States? 15 MR. MEADE: Not once he had left the United 16 States. But all my client wants -- all my client wanted 17 at that time was to be placed in the same circumstance 18 as all other aliens subject to a final ruling. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but he's not in the 20 same circumstance. I mean, he's made his choice. He 21 was offered voluntary departure, which had advantages. 22 He could arrange his affairs and go when he wanted 23 within 60 days. What he gave up was the ability to 24 appeal the determination. 25 That doesn't seem to me as, as outrageous.
13

1 I mean, it happens all the time. When a criminal 2 defendant pleads to a lesser charge, he gives up the 3 ability to appeal. And that's what's going on here. He 4 has gotten the advantage of a voluntary departure and 5 given up the ability to appeal. I don't bleed for him. 6 It seems to me it's an option presented 7 before him and he took it. 8 MR. MEADE: I have three responses, Justice 9 Scalia. 10 First, I'll agree that the alien can file 11 the motion to reopen. The only question is whether it's 12 going to be adjudicated in time. 13 Second, as for the question of the bargain, 14 whether giving up appeals is part of the bargain, all 15 parties agree that an alien who accepts voluntary 16 departure can continue to appeal to the Board, to the 17 courts of appeals. The only, the only adjudicatory 18 process that the government says that my client is not 19 entitled to now is one motion to reopen. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Still and all, it's part of 21 the deal. Even better. Even better. He hasn't even 22 given up all his appeals. 23 MR. MEADE: One final -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's just, part of the deal 25 he gave up this little ability to reopen, and that's --
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that's the choice he made when he accepted voluntary 2 departure. 3 MR. MEADE: One final response is that in 4 the government's proposed regulation, an alien is 5 permitted to file a motion to reopen notwithstanding 6 having been granted voluntary departure, which indicates 7 that the government itself does not think that the 8 bargain includes -- or that Congress did not intend the 9 bargain to include a waiver of the one motion to reopen 10 which all aliens are entitled to file. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Going back to the 12 question that Justice Alito put to you, that he would 13 then be, and you agree this is what you asked for first, 14 like any other removable alien. And Justice Alito asked 15 you: Well, then he could be removed immediately, is 16 that not so? My understanding was, yes, that's so, but 17 you can move for a stay of removal when you have a 18 reopening pending. Is that true? 19 MR. MEADE: Yes. If you have a final order 20 of removal, yes, you can file for a stay once you have a 21 final order. So my client is in a worse position. 22 Because he's under the voluntary departure grant, he 23 cannot get the same ability for a stay that those who 24 are subject to a final removal. So the irony is -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you say that tolling is
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 automatic, which I assume is your position, would it be 2 possible under the statutes to say that tolling is not 3 automatic but can be permitted in the discretion of the 4 hearing officer? 5 MR. MEADE: I -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or are we then just 7 inventing something that's not in the statute at all? 8 MR. MEADE: Well, the problem, Justice 9 Kennedy, is that the agency would need to act within the 10 short time period. And -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. All it needs to do is 12 to say, we'll grant you an extension while we look at 13 this. 14 MR. MEADE: That's true, Justice Kennedy. 15 But that's essentially the same action that would be 16 needed to decide the motion to reopen in the first 17 place. Motions to reopen are discretionary. They go to 18 the same Board member that had decided the original 19 appeal. So it does not take much time or effort for the 20 agency to be able to decide these, as is reflected by 21 the general time periods for adjudication. 22 For example, in the Dekoladeno case on the 23 Fourth Circuit, the motion was decided in 23 days. In 24 the Sidikhouya case out of the Eighth Circuit -25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, presumably it
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 doesn't take them much time because when someone elects 2 voluntary departure they don't have to address it. I 3 mean, this would obviously increase the volume of 4 motions to reopen. As I said, I don't see know why 5 anybody -- why everybody wouldn't file one, because it 6 extends their stay. 7 MR. MEADE: It's a discretionary 8 determination to the single Board member. And the Board 9 member could deny the motion to reopen, even when 10 there's a prima facie case. All they have to do is look 11 to see if it -- in the subset of cases that the agency, 12 exercising its own discretion, where they agree that a 13 motion to reopen is proper. And all we're asking for in 14 this case, not special procedures, not anything added to 15 the motion to reopen process, but only the right to have 16 -17 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there appeal? I mean, 18 what happens? They file a motion to reopen, denied. 19 Now, can they appeal that? 20 MR. MEADE: Yes. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And how much time 22 does that take? 23 MR. MEADE: Well, the denial of a motion to 24 reopen, at that point there would be a final order in 25 effect.

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. But how -- do they 2 then appeal the motion to -- they appeal the motion -3 the denial of the motion to reopen or how long -- where 4 do they go? Do they have -- this is the Board, so they 5 go right to the court of appeals? 6 MR. MEADE: That's correct. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: And how long do those take 8 on average? 9 MR. MEADE: One difference, though, between 10 petitions for review and motions to reopen is that 11 petitions for review can be decided from outside the 12 country under the 1996 amendments. And motions to 13 reopen under the agency's regulations, cannot. So the 14 problem is that there is no ability for an alien -15 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not interested in the 16 problem. I'm interested in how much added time it 17 actually means. So let's go -- if you win, how much 18 additional time in a typical case would the alien have 19 before he has to leave? 20 MR. MEADE: Petitions for review take 21 longer. According to the agency's current regulations, 22 they take approximately, I believe, 13 months or so is 23 what the -24 JUSTICE BREYER: And then, and then do you 25 in addition ask for cert or is it not in addition? Are
18

1 you including that within the 13 months? 2 MR. MEADE: Your Honor, I don't have those 3 exact statistics. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: Or would you just guess on 5 the basis of your experience? I'm not holding you to 6 it. 7 MR. MEADE: There might be cases where alien 8 seek cert as well. But for the most part -9 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. What I'm 10 wondering here, and this is because I see two contrary 11 things, if for to you win it means that you are adding 12 an average of, say, 400 days to a stay where Congress 13 said we want you to stay no more than 60 days or 120? 14 That's pretty hard for me to reconcile, to tell you the 15 truth. 16 MR. MEADE: Well, one of the answers on that 17 question on the petition for review front is exactly 18 what the government has proposed in its rule going 19 forward, which is that an alien who has voluntary 20 departure can file a petition for review, but by doing 21 so the voluntary departure grant terminates and they're 22 in the same position as other aliens, on the same level 23 playing as other aliens. That's the solution being 24 proposed by the government going forward, and as to the 25 petition for review hypothetical that would also apply.
19
Alderson Reporting Company

1 That would just put my client in the same position as 2 all other aliens, including criminal aliens. 3 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure I understand 4 it. Are you asking for automatic tolling just until the 5 motion to reopen is decided or until the motion is 6 decided and also the appeal process has run? 7 MR. MEADE: Just for the motion, just for 8 the time that the motion to reopen is decided. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Well then, that's the 11 answer to my question. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: But in your discussion with 13 Justice Breyer you seemed to be saying that he can hang 14 around right through the appeal. 15 MR. MEADE: Thank you for the correction, 16 Justice Scalia. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is your 18 position that the right to appeal is taken away, just as 19 under the current regime the motion to reopen is taken 20 away? 21 MR. MEADE: No, Chief Justice Roberts. The 22 difference is that petitions for review can be 23 adjudicated from outside the country, so whether the 24 alien is here or abroad he can get an adjudication of 25 his motion -- of his petition for review, and that was a
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 change under the 1996 act. 2 The problem for motions to reopen is that an 3 alien cannot receive an adjudication at all. He can't 4 stay. He can't go. There's no way for those new facts. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's by regulation, 6 though, that he can't, he cannot pursue that from out of 7 the country. 8 MR. MEADE: Yes, that's true. That is 9 not -- that is by regulation, although that regulation 10 applies to all motions to reopen, not just for the 11 subset of motions to reopen or voluntary departure 12 recipients. 13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If your client or some 14 other client, assuming the government wins in this case, 15 leaves within the 60-day period and the petition for 16 rehearing is forwarded, can he take all these affidavits 17 and apply for an adjustment of status, or is that much 18 longer? 19 MR. MEADE: No. The problem is that for an 20 alien, for many aliens covered by voluntary departure, 21 once they leave the country they are subject to various 22 unlawful presence bars. So by leaving the country these 23 bars are triggered and they cannot get the same relief 24 from outside the country. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even with voluntary
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 departure? 2 MR. MEADE: Even with voluntary departure. 3 Leaving the country triggers these bars. Once you're 4 outside the country you cannot reapply for admission for 5 in some cases up to 10 years, and that precludes the 6 ability to leave the country and seek the relief, even 7 if you have a marriage to a United States citizen, even 8 if there are extreme circumstances in a particular case 9 that need to be addressed and that would be addressed 10 under a motion to reopen. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have to argue 12 that the -- my understanding is that once the -- let's 13 say it's the government's proposed regulation and the 14 motion for -- or the voluntary departure is withdrawn to 15 enable you to consider the motion to reopen. They can 16 proceed with deportation at that time, correct? 17 MR. MEADE: Absolutely. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you -- you almost 19 have to be arguing that the motion to reopen tolls the 20 time for deportation as well, right? 21 MR. MEADE: No. We just want -- under the, 22 under the question -- under the government's proposed 23 rule or under the -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, under your 25 position, I guess, is what your position is on that.
22
Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. MEADE: Right. Well, the tolling 2 solution, the tolling construction, would permit tolling 3 during the voluntary departure period and during the 4 voluntary departure period there is no final order in 5 effect. So yes, it would toll the time for leaving the 6 country. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, the 8 government cannot enter a deportation order during a 9 voluntary departure period. 10 MR. MEADE: Yes. That's governed by the 11 agency's own regulations that say that there's no -- the 12 ultimate order of deportation does not go into effect 13 until an overstay of a voluntary departure period. 14 One thing that is -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: So I'm not following this. 16 I thought the assumption was we're going to be using the 17 government's new proposed system, in which the 18 acceptance of voluntary departure is eliminated when you 19 file a reopening petition, right. So can the government 20 then proceed to deport you involuntarily or is that also 21 going to be stayed until, until completion of the 22 reopening petition? 23 MR. MEADE: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia. 24 You're absolutely right. I was addressing the tolling 25 construction with Mr. Chief Justice. But as to the
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 government's proposed rule under the proposed rule and 2 what my client asks for, the time -- the alien would be 3 automatically subject to a final order and could be 4 deported involuntarily so long as the alien did not get 5 and obtain a stay of deportation from the agency or the 6 court, so yes. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that, that involuntary 8 deportation would effectively cancel the, the petition 9 for reopening, right? 10 MR. MEADE: If the agency acted quickly 11 enough and involuntarily deported someone within that 12 time -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why are you willing to 14 leave the involuntary deportees in that position, 15 whereas you're not willing to leave the voluntary 16 deportees in that position, that their reopening 17 petition just vanishes? Why is it any fairer for the 18 involuntary deportees than for the voluntary? In fact 19 it's probably fairer for the voluntary because they made 20 their choice. 21 MR. MEADE: Your Honor, I agree with you 22 that that regulation is problematic, although the Court 23 does not need to address it in this case. 24 With the court's permission, I would like to 25 reserve the balance of my time.

KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 7 please the Court: 8 The filing of a motion to reopen does not 9 automatically suspend the obligation of an alien to 10 leave the United States within the time that was 11 specified in the Board's order granting permission to 12 depart voluntarily. The grant of voluntary departure 13 reflects an exchange of benefits between the government 14 and the alien and Petitioner's automatic tolling rule 15 would greatly subvert that reciprocal arrangement by 16 giving the alien the unilateral and automatic ability to 17 extend the substantive terms of the immigration relief 18 the -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, I think, I 20 think that your, your opposing counsel gave a good 21 answer to that. I also thought it was a quid pro quo, 22 but it's a very strange quid pro quo. I could 23 understand the government saying, look, if you accept 24 voluntary departure your reopening is dead; you have to 25 choose between asking for reopening or voluntary

1 departure. But that's not the quid pro quo you're 2 saying that the government is adopting. The quid pro 3 quo is if you accept voluntary departure you roll the 4 dice as to whether your reopening petition will be 5 decided in time. It isn't dead. It's still there, but 6 you just have to hope that it will be decided before you 7 get deported. 8 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, let me make one -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a very 10 strange statutory quid pro quo, it seems to me. 11 MR. KNEEDLER: Let me make one point clear 12 at the outset. Petitioner's motion to reopen was not 13 dismissed because he was not able to file one. It was 14 denied because he was not eligible for the underlying 15 substantive relief that he requested in this motion. 16 Overstaying a voluntary departure period does not, for 17 example, bar an alien from obtaining asylum or 18 withholding of removal on a motion to reopen. It's only 19 the particular substantive form of relief that he 20 requested in his motion to reopen that is at issue, and 21 that was denied. 22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be. But 23 Congress passed a statute that grants a statutory right 24 to file a motion to reopen no matter what the relief is. 25 And the thing that seems strange to me, I guess to carry
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Justice Scalia's question one step further, is what 2 seems strange to me is that Congress would have granted 3 that right in effect across the board, regardless of 4 what the reason for the reopening might be and yet would 5 have done so knowing that the, that the time for 6 adjudication before the IJ is likely to take longer than 7 the period of the, prior to the moment of required 8 departure. It sounds as though Congress on your view 9 would be -- would have been giving a right to reopen 10 that in practical terms in most cases will avail the 11 alien absolutely nothing because he'll have to get out 12 before there can be an adjudication. 13 MR. KNEEDLER: With all respect, that's not 14 correct. 15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why? 16 MR. KNEEDLER: Again, both prior to 1996 and 17 after 1996 Congress specified that an alien who 18 overstays the voluntary departure period is ineligible 19 for three forms of discretionary relief. Now it's 20 voluntary departure, cancellation or removal, or 21 adjustment of status. That was true both beforehand and 22 afterhand. Before 1996, there was no statutory 23 limitation on the time for either a motion to reopen or 24 voluntary departure. Congress was concerned about 25 abuses on both of those fronts, and what it did in 1996
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 was to compress the voluntary departure time for 60 days 2 because it was concerned about how long the agency was 3 allowing agents -- aliens to remain in the country under 4 orders of voluntary departure. And what it did with 5 respect to motions to reopen was very modest. It just 6 put in statutory form a limitation that the agency had 7 put in place pursuant to a statutory directive to place 8 time and number limitations on motions to reopen because 9 of Congress's concern about abuse. 10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but isn't the 11 question in this case whether what Congress did was as 12 modest as you say? Because if it is as modest as you 13 say, then in at least a substantial category of cases in 14 which a motion to reopen will be filed, it will in fact 15 be no time in the real world to act on that motion 16 before the voluntary departure date. And the question 17 is did Congress really intend a right to reopen that is 18 as modest as that. 19 MR. KNEEDLER: Well -20 JUSTICE SOUTER: And it seems strange that 21 it would have. 22 MR. KNEEDLER: Two responses to that. With 23 respect to the voluntary departure, Congress anticipated 24 that the alien was going to leave under the order of 25 voluntary departure, not remain here. And prior to

KNEEDLER: That regulation has been a 7 fundamental part of motions to reopen going back at 8 least until the 1960s. 9 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, we assume that Congress 10 knew that. 11 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Yes, we do have. And 12 that's part of the arrangement. The only thing -- and 13 that regulation was repromulgated as part of General 14 Motion to Reopen Regulation in 1995. 15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, then Congress knew at 16 the time of the '96 Act that, if in fact the motion to 17 reopen was filed in the normal course, it probably 18 couldn't be heard prior to the date at which (a) the 19 alien either will overstay and be in trouble for that or 20 (b) will have departed and, under the existing 21 regulatory regime, have forfeited his right to reopen. 22 And it's the strangeness that Congress would want -23 would have wanted to extend the right to reopen to a 24 statutory level under these circumstances unless it 25 contemplated some kind of a tolling scheme that would
29

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 avoid this sort of Kafka-esque result. 2 MR. KNEEDLER: No. Again, if I may, the -3 what Congress had in mind with the deal of granting 4 voluntary departure was it greatly constricted the time 5 to leave. You have to leave in 60 days, and if you 6 don't leave in 60 days, you're not going to get 7 voluntary departure adjustment of status or cancellation 8 or removal. It didn't affect the eligibility for other 9 substantive relief that an alien might file for in a 10 motion to reopen, such as asylum, such as if he has new 11 evidence going to the ground of removal. But Congress 12 was particularly concerned not to allow these three 13 forms of discretionary relief to remain available. And 14 so I think Congress necessarily would have been 15 unconcerned about whether, if an alien did file a motion 16 to reopen within that greatly constricted 60-day period 17 -- in fact, in this case the Board gave 30 days -18 Congress wasn't concerned about preserving the 19 underlying substantive eligibility for those forms of 20 discretionary relief, because it made that part of the 21 deal, that alien was giving up if he left -- if he 22 didn't leave the country, he was giving up that. Those 23 were lesser order forms of relief that Congress was 24 making available, but it did did not take away, for 25 example, the right to apply for asylum or withholding.

And 23 then the second thing was, if I can't do that, please 24 extend my voluntary departure time while I move to 25 reopen. It seems that this litigant is being put in a

KNEEDLER: But the Court rewrote the 5 question presented so as not to -- not to address that, 6 so I think it's not before the Court right here. But -7 but beyond that, the deal, the arrangement -- the 8 Attorney General has a lot of discretion how to 9 implement the voluntary departure provision. In fact, 10 he has the authority to eliminate voluntary departure 11 for additional categories of people who are not eligible 12 under the statute itself. So whether to -13 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the basis for the 14 rule that an alien can't withdraw, can't seek to 15 withdraw a request for voluntary departure? 16 MR.

KNEEDLER: As far as I'm aware there is 21 no regulation that prohibits it, but the order is a 22 grant of voluntary departure, and the Board of 23 Immigration Appeals order says you're granted permission 24 to depart voluntarily within 30 days; if you do not, the 25 following consequences flow from that. Nothing in the
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Board's order would allow the alien to avoid those 2 consequences by saying on the 28th day, after all I 3 don't want to do that. And this matter of implementing 4 the voluntary departure agreement is part of a general 5 scheme of a quid pro quo between the alien and the 6 United States. The voluntary departure is granted under 7 circumstances where the alien doesn't have that option. 8 So unilaterally -- allowing the alien unilaterally to do 9 that now is not provided for. Now, that doesn't -- that 10 doesn't take away from the Attorney General's 11 discretionary authority in implementing the Act to 12 provide for that, which is what he has proposed in the 13 new rule. But this case has to be decided under the -14 under the rules that are now in effect. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm having a lot of trouble 16 understanding the case, because it's so complicated.

In 20 practical terms there's no way he is going to get 21 through the BIA in 30 days. And, therefore, when he 22 leaves the country, he cannot then try to get or 23 complete his BIA review, and he therefore will have no 24 chance to get into court, right? 25 MR. KNEEDLER: I think that -- I think that
36

1 would be correct unless -- I don't think this has ever 2 come up that I'm aware of, about whether you could go to 3 court from an immigration judge's decision where you've 4 left the country and therefore can't appeal to the BIA. 5 JUSTICE SOUTER: There's no reason to assume 6 that you could. 7 MR. KNEEDLER: I just don't know the answer 8 -- I just don't know the answer to that, because I'm not 9 sure that scenario has come up, because usually, if 10 somebody wants to contest, they're not going to leave 11 the country before they have to, and if you appeal from 12 the immigration judge to the Board of Immigration 13 Appeals, that suspends the finality of the order of 14 removal or the order of voluntary departure that the 15 immigration judge has entered. So if you appeal -- if 16 you want to stay in the country, all you have to do is 17 file an automatic appeal with the Board of Immigration 18 Appeals and that suspends the finality of the departure 19 time. 20 JUSTICE SOUTER: And by doing that you do 21 preserve your right to appeal; and you will preserve 22 your -- will you also preserve your right to go to court 23 if you lose in front of the BIA. 24 MR.

1 judge's -2 MR. KNEEDLER: With the immigration judge. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 4 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I suppose you could do 5 that, but the -- but the appeal -- it would be like a 6 motion to reopen in the district court while you've got 7 an appeal to the -- to the BIA. I -- I think once the 8 appeal goes to the Board -- this case involves motions 9 to reopen filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals, 10 not with the immigration judge, and so -- the alien here 11 conceded his deportability, sought a continuance, and 12 that was denied. He had no other substantive grounds of 13 relief. He asked for voluntary departure. That was 14 granted. He took an appeal to the BIA arguing he should 15 have been granted a continuance; the Board affirmed; 16 reinstated a 30-day departure period; and then he wanted 17 to seek reopening. 18 And one question that Justice Breyer asked 19 about, what if reopening is denied would the automatic 20 tolling rule continue? I suppose the alien could file a 21 motion to reconsider the denial of the motion to reopen, 22 and if you had an automatic tolling rule, it would -- it 23 would last as long as it took the Board to act on the 24 motion to reopen, which is -- which 60, 90, 120 days. 25 In this past Fiscal Year the Board on motions to reopen
39

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 resolved I think only about 55 percent of those within 2 90 days. The Board has a huge backlog, and we're 3 talking -- and so we are talking about the very kind of 4 abuse of the immigration system that this Court was 5 concerned about -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: May I ask one question? 7 And I'm not sure the progression in which Justice Breyer 8 was going to begin. I take it that the motion to reopen 9 has -- shows new evidence, new factors, new 10 circumstances; and that would be unavailable on the 11 appeal, because the record hasn't been supplemented. Or 12 am I wrong about that? 13 MR. KNEEDLER: That -- that's true. It has 14 -15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: While you have an appeal 16 -- while you have an appeal from what was in the record. 17 MR. KNEEDLER: Right, although -18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you don't have the 19 motion to reopen then the -- then the new material is 20 not subject to the appeal, or am I wrong? 21 MR. KNEEDLER: No. It's not subject to the 22 appeal as such but the Board procedures take account of 23 developments that happen while the case is on appeal, 24 which is that you can file with the Board while your 25 appeal is pending and ask for a motion to remand on the
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 ground that new evidence has come up. For example, in 2 the case of adjustment of status, where -- the alien's 3 wife has filed a petition for immediate relative status 4 to let the alien get a visa, if while the case is 5 pending on appeal that petition has been granted, then 6 -- then it would -- then all the alien has to do is file 7 a motion with the Board and say there is new 8 information; please remand it back to the immigration 9 judge. So a lot of times what has happened is -- maybe 10 intervening things have happened but the alien doesn't 11 do anything about it during the year that the appeal is 12 pending with the Board of Immigration Appeals; then 13 there is a final order and the alien rushes in with the 14 -- with the new information at that point, where if you 15 had only brought it to the attention of the Board while 16 the appeal was pending, it could have been remanded. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: So your basic is -- don't 18 tell me if I'm right if I'm wrong, please. The -19 the -- what I'm thinking your basic problem or position 20 is and why you've got into this, is because you think 21 any really meritorious case where there should be 22 reopening will be pointed out to the Board before there 23 is a final order in effect and before voluntary 24 departure becomes an issue? 25 MR. KNEEDLER: That -- that --
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE BREYER: And if we decide against 2 you, then you're thinking, well, what will happen in 3 every case is after there is a final order, the alien 4 will move for a motion to reopen because he will get a 5 few extra days. 6 MR. KNEEDLER: It's more than a few extra 7 days. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: He gets a -- several -9 MR. KNEEDLER: It's an automatic tolling 10 period. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Have I got it right, what 12 your point is? 13 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. That is correct and I 14 -- and I think it's fair to say if you're talking about 15 changed circumstances or new evidence that arises after 16 the IJ has rendered his decision, that's a period that 17 might be a year; it might be a year and a half. New 18 developments or changed circumstances are far more 19 likely to have happened during that period of time than 20 they would during a 30-day period of voluntary departure 21 that -- that the Board reinstates at the conclusion of 22 the appeal. 23 So an alien in this position who has been 24 granted voluntary departure and knows that a motion to 25 reopen may not be a realistic option, if he wants to

KNEEDLER: No, that -- that is correct. 10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is there any reason he 11 could not unilaterally relinquish the voluntary 12 departure status as distinct from having to get approval 13 from the Board or bureaucrat? 14 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, as I say, the way that 15 -- the Board's order grants him permission to voluntary 16 depart and says the following consequences will attach 17 if you do not. Nothing in the Board's order allows him 18 to withdraw. It grants him that permission. 19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I know it doesn't -20 it doesn't address the issue, and my question is -21 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think it probably 22 forecloses it. 23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why? 24 MR. KNEEDLER: Because it's the -- it's the 25 content of the Board's order that -- that says you have

1 60 days to depart and if you do not, the following 2 consequences attach. 3 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the Board is 4 saying, look, I'm granting your request -- we are 5 granting your request for a voluntary departure status 6 and there are certain consequences that that status 7 carries. He is saying, on my hypothesis, I relinquish 8 that status. Why are conditions that attach when he has 9 the status an indication that he cannot voluntarily 10 relinquish that status without further action by the 11 Board? 12 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I -- the statute and 13 regulations just don't provide for it. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if they don't provide 15 for it, and they don't say you can't do it, why isn't it 16 arbitrary not to let him do it?

My -13 JUSTICE BREYER: So why not apply them to 14 this person? 15 MR. KNEEDLER: As they are now drafted they 16 would apply prospectively. But my only point is that 17 voluntary departure and motions to reopen are 18 administered under the statute and the regulations and 19 the BIA orders that are entered under the current 20 regulatory framework, which has a different sort of deal 21 between the alien and the government in mind, and that 22 -23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which you say -- you say 24 that under the current regime, the voluntary departure 25 application, granted, is irrevocable.

It doesn't say 5 and if you do this it's irrevocable. 6 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And I want to qualify 7 my answer in a further respect -- that regulations with 8 respect to voluntary departure being granted by the 9 Board don't say anything like that. But I am informed 10 by the executive office of immigration review that if 11 the immigration judge grants voluntary departure and the 12 alien appeals to the Board, the ordinary course would be 13 for the Board to reinstate voluntary departure if it 14 rejects the alien's appeal. But if on appeal the alien 15 requests that voluntary departure not be reinstated once 16 the Board's order is entered, then the Board will omit 17 that from its final order of removal. 18 But Petitioner here did not request on his 19 appeal to the Board that the Board not reinstate a -20 order a voluntary departure if it had affirmed on the 21 merits. And so the Board went forward on the assumption 22 that the alien had requested voluntary departure, 23 entered an order on that assumption, and once it's 24 entered, it's a final order that would require some 25 amendment of the order, in order to -- in order to be

1 changed under the current regime. 2 JUSTICE GINSBERG: But the order didn't say 3 he couldn't withdraw? 4 MR. KNEEDLER: No, it didn't. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: So what about this? I'm 6 just trying this out. You don't have to respond if you 7 don't want to. But you say, look, the AG in his rules 8 here, really tried to reconcile the two interests that 9 we talked about in our prior conversation. Now 10 hypothetically, I suppose you say that was a reasonable 11 way of going about this, and we remand for consideration 12 about whether this prior situation that you couldn't do 13 that was arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion, or 14 your failure to apply it retroactively to a certain 15 class of people was arbitrary, capricious, abusive 16 discretion? 17 MR. KNEEDLER: I think -- I think if the 18 Court wants to get into the question of whether he could 19 withdraw it, the proper thing for the Court to do would 20 be to reject the Petitioner's argument that there is an 21 automatic tolling rule, because that's fundamentally 22 inconsistent with Congress' deliberate intention to 23 impose a short deadline and not let the agency extend 24 that, but to remand to the Board of Immigration Appeals 25 for an explanation as to whether he could withdraw his

1 request for voluntary departure. 2 I don't think the Court should decide that 3 question on its own. I think that should be remanded to 4 the Board. If in the meantime the Attorney General 5 issues regulations that provide for withdrawal of the 6 request, maybe because his case would be back before the 7 Board, those new regulations could be applied. But 8 whether that -- the alien should be allowed to do that 9 is fundamentally a question for the Attorney General in 10 the first instance. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In one of your -- in one 12 of your arguments earlier you said the whole idea of 13 voluntary departure is to expedite the proceedings and 14 so forth. I assume that voluntary departure is never 15 elected as an option before the Board rules. 16 MR. KNEEDLER: It is -17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, it -- or 18 am I wrong? 19 MR. KNEEDLER: No. It was elected before 20 the immigration judge. That's where you request it. If 21 the immigration judge rejects your arguments against 22 removability, grants you voluntary departure -23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but the removal -- at 24 the outset, you don't elect voluntary departure at the 25 outset of the hearing?

1 MR. KNEEDLER: You can. And you can get 120 2 days of time to depart. You can do that. People who 3 don't want to contest the removability at all -4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, no. I mean in a 5 contested case. 6 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. In the contested 7 cases, you would ask for that at the conclusion of the 8 hearing before the immigration judge. That gets 9 suspended if you appeal to the BIA because the order is 10 not final. It doesn't become final until the Board of 11 Immigration Appeals affirms. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler, do you 13 know what percentage of these motions to reopen are 14 granted? 15 MR. KNEEDLER: I do not. I asked that 16 question, and I do not know the answer to that. 17 I would like to come back to the fundamental 18 automatic tolling rule that -- the fundamental 19 inconsistency of that automatic tolling rule with what 20 Congress did in 1996, because it shortened to 60 days 21 the time limit in which an alien can depart. 22 It also eliminated a prior exception that 23 had been the law that allowed an exception to the 24 consequences for somebody who overstayed even the much 25 longer voluntary departure period for exceptional
50

1 circumstances. Congress repealed that exception. 2 Prior to 1996, the Board in the case we cite 3 in our briefs called Matter of Shaar, held that if an 4 alien is granted voluntary departure and files a motion 5 to reopen, it rejected two arguments. One is that the 6 filing of a motion to reopen was itself exceptional 7 circumstances that eliminated the deadline. It rejected 8 that. It also in an en banc decision rejected the 9 automatic tolling rule that Petitioner is arguing for 10 here under a situation in which Congress had granted a 11 long time for aliens to voluntarily depart. 12 We think it defies common sense to suggest 13 that when Congress compressed the time to 60 days, it 14 meant to at the same time reverse what the Board had 15 done in Matter of Shaar and granted an automatic tolling 16 rule, not even one under the control of the immigration 17 authorities, but an automatic tolling rule as a matter 18 of law simply by the unilateral act of filing a motion 19 to reopen. 20 And the Board in Matter of Shaar addressed 21 all of those things. The Board of Immigration Appeals 22 has filed, followed Matter of Shaar, in the intervening 23 years since 1997 -- and importantly, I would like to 24 point this out, too, when Petitioner sought a motion for 25 reopening, he relied on a Board decision called
51

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Villarde, which recognized that in some circumstances an 2 alien may file a motion to reopen to try to get 3 adjustment of status if there has been intervening 4 development with respect to an immediate relative 5 petition filed by a spouse. 6 The Board adopted that rule in this en banc 7 published decision Villarde, but said one of the 8 qualifications for being eligible for that relief is 9 that you not be barred under Matter of Shaar, which 10 means you not be barred by having overstayed your 11 voluntary departure period. 12 So, in the very procedure that Petitioner 13 invoked in this case, there is a published Board 14 decision post-1997 that relies on that -- that relies on 15 that rationale, and the Board has followed that 16 consistently. It is at the very least a reasonable 17 interpretation of the act for the Attorney General not 18 to allow the undermining of this tightened voluntary 19 departure system by providing for reopening. 20 I should also point out that this is not 21 tolling in the normal sense. Tolling usually arises 22 where a person has a claim and there is a statute of 23 limitations for filing a claim before a forum. 24 Petitioner here was already granted 25 voluntary departure. The 60-day time limit is not a
52

1 procedural statute of limitations. It is a limitation 2 on substantive immigration relief. And we think it's 3 particularly odd that the filing of a procedural motion 4 to reopen would have the effect of changing the 5 statutorily limited time in which an alien could 6 voluntarily depart the United States. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 8 Mr. Kneedler. 9 Mr. Meade, you have five minutes remaining. 10 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE 11 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 12 MR. MEADE: The government's arguments on 13 the statutory interpretation in this case are undermined 14 by its own proposed rule for at least five reasons. 15 First, their proposed rule makes clear that 16 the government agrees that the statute can be read to 17 have multiple meanings. 18 Second, the proposed rule makes clear that 19 Congress did not intend voluntary departure recipients 20 to waive the motion to reopen in accepting voluntary 21 departure. 22 Third, the rule stresses the importance of 23 motions to reopen and their importance in bringing 24 changed facts to the agency's attention. 25 Fourth, the proposed rule turns on
53

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 unilateral action of the alien and permits that 2 unilateral action to terminate the voluntary departure 3 grant. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree with counsel 5 for the government as to how long it typically takes for 6 these motions to reopen to be disposed of? He said 7 something like 55 percent take, what, more than -8 MR. MEADE: My understanding is that the 9 time, that the time is actually relatively short, that 10 they are generally decided within 90 days. They're 11 procedures passed by the -- by regulation which indicate 12 that they go to the same Board member. There has been 13 streamlining procedures by the agency in the early 2000, 14 2001, 2002 period which helped expedite these. And 15 actually, the time -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any 17 estimate about how many more motions to reopen will have 18 to be considered if your client prevails in this case? 19 MR. MEADE: I do not think that there will 20 be many additional motions to reopen, if that happens. 21 Certainly, if the government has a -- if the proposed 22 rule is adopted, the number of motions to reopen will 23 not be affected, because prospectively, the solution -24 the problem will have been solved, and this case we'll 25 only be dealing with people in the pipeline, people who
54

1 have already made decisions about whether to file a 2 motion to reopen or not. 3 So assuming that the government's proposed 4 rule is enacted in anything like its proposed form, then 5 there will be no problem going forward. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I don't 7 understand that, because my -- as I understand it, it 8 would in every case grant an effective extension of the 9 time which you would have to depart if you had filed a 10 motion to reopen. 11 MR. MEADE: No, that's not correct, with 12 respect. Under the government's proposed rule, the 13 alien would be placed in the same position as other 14 aliens and would be -- and there would be no additional 15 incentive to file a motion to reopen. 16 Under the government's proposed rule, the 17 period would not toll, the voluntary departure grant 18 would expire, and the alien would be placed in the same 19 position as otherwise -20 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it your position that 21 the statute requires tolling? 22 MR. MEADE: Our interpretation is the 23 statute is subject to multiple interpretations. But the 24 one thing that the statute does not permit is the 25 solution, the construction that's being proposed by the
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 government in this case. The government -- the statute 2 would permit tolling. The statute permits reconciling 3 the provisions as the government proposes going forward. 4 But the one thing that the statute does not permit is 5 the government's position in this particular litigation. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You answered my 7 question with respect to the government's proposed 8 regulation. But under your position that would allow 9 the voluntary departure option to remain open, then 10 anyone who exercised that option would want to file a 11 motion to reopen because it would extend their time? 12 MR. MEADE: The motions to reopen are 13 subject to statutory and regulatory limits. Moreover, 14 the time period -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The answer is yes? 16 MR. MEADE: I'm saying that there -- aliens 17 could choose to do so, but I disagree that there would 18 be a -- many additional motions to reopen. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Your answer is yes, but the 20 Attorney General's rule would prevent that -- proposed 21 rule would -22 MR. MEADE: Yes. That's part of the answer, 23 yes, Justice Scalia. 24 But in addition, the length of time of 25 adjudication is entirely within the agency's control.
56

1 It can take two days, two weeks, two months, or if it 2 takes longer -3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not if it has 10,000 4 of these a year, as you told me in your opening 5 argument. I mean, it takes some time to address them. 6 You can't say all they have to do is decide them all 7 within two days. 8 MR. MEADE: No. But the answer is that 9 there -- it is within their control, so the length of 10 tolling under any tolling rule is not within the control 11 of the alien. It's within the control of the agency. 12 This Court -- as to your question, Justice 13 Alito, on the -- with the regulations with respect to 14 withdraw in this case, the agency is silent on that. 15 It's unclear to me why the agency -- may I finish -16 it's unclear why the agency did not give my client the 17 request he requested, and we ask that this Court either 18 grant tolling or interpret the statute consistent with 19 the government's proposed rule. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 21 The case is submitted. 22 (Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the case in the 23 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 24 25
