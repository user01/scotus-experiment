1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:08 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next this morning in Case 09-1273, Astra USA v. Santa 5 Clara County. 6 Ms. Blatt. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 10 and may it please the Court: 11 There are three reasons why section 340B 12 entities do not have a cause of ation to enforce the 13 pharmaceutical pricing agreement between the Secretary 14 and manufacturers. 15 The first reason is that this common law 16 breach of contract suit is indistinguishable from an 17 implied right of action to enforce the statute, a right 18 Respondent concedes it does not have. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't understand that. 20 A private contract is just that. Two parties go into 21 the contract. They set the terms of their deal. No one 22 forced the manufacturers to enter into this deal. So 23 why isn't the issue exactly what the circuit court said: 24 What was the intent of the parties to the contract? You 25 want to make it Congress's intent, but this is a private
3

1 deal between you. And Congress may have specified some 2 terms to include, but - 3 MS. BLATT: Yes. And the -- what is being 4 challenged here is the contractual term that 5 incorporates in haec verba the manufacturer's ceiling 6 price obligations under the Act, and a third-party 7 beneficiary's suit to enforce the contract asserts the 8 same right, seeks the same remedy, and causes all the 9 same disruptions as a right of action to enforce the 10 statute. 11 And another way of saying that is, if the 12 case begins with the premise that Congress foreclosed 13 340B entities from bringing an implied right of action 14 through the front door, Congress did not leave the back 15 door open to essentially the same suit. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you answer the 17 point that, if Congress wanted to make this a pure 18 regulatory statute, it wouldn't have even required a 19 contract? It would have just passed a statute that says 20 anyone who wants to -- to sell to the -- to the States 21 or to the 340B entities -- you can't charge more than 22 this price. 23 Why do we even need a contract, unless 24 inherent with it is some discretion in the agency who's 25 administering it?

1 MS. BLATT: Right. Well - 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Discretion that is 3 consistent with normal contract principles. 4 MS. BLATT: Right. Well, our position is 5 obviously that the parties had no discretion to confer 6 Article III power on courts to enforce an Act of 7 Congress, and this is. But the -- the basic answer is 8 that there has always been a huge difference between the 9 settled rule that parties to a statutory contract are 10 enforceable -- they have a cause of action to enforce 11 the contract, because Congress spoke with unambiguously 12 clear language that the parties could sue. That's the 13 way statutory contracts must work. They must be 14 enforceable. 15 But your answer, sort of as a practical 16 matter, what's the difference, is this is a -- this is a 17 contract, and we do think that the Federal law of 18 contracts and contractual remedies flow between the 19 parties to the contract. It's a bilateral agreement, 20 it's not a regulation, and the Secretary made specific 21 enforceable promises. And there's obviously no even 22 operation of the statutory mandate without the contract. 23 But the reverse, in terms of the -- the 24 long-settled rule that parties must be able to sue to 25 enforce a contract, there's an equally settled rule that
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 beneficiaries under a statute do not have the right to 2 enforce it unless there's a cause of action. 3 Now, the test that I think Respondent 4 advocates and that the Ninth Circuit applied is a test 5 this Court has long since discarded, which is: Well, 6 I'm a beneficiary, and this is a good idea, and this is 7 sensible. Even if you don't buy our test of you have to 8 imply the implied right of action, these lawsuits are 9 neither sensible nor a good idea and not what Congress 10 intended. And here's why. 11 And it is basically the second and third 12 reasons. So no matter how you come at this case and the 13 lens through which you look at this, I think everyone 14 should come out to the same place, which is that neither 15 Congress nor the Secretary nor the manufacturers signed 16 up to what is in essence -- would be over 14,000 17 lawsuits against 500 manufacturers challenging the 18 pricing for over 35,000 medications under Medicaid. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your adversary claims 20 you gave up your argument that the contract doesn't make 21 the manufacturers a third-party intended beneficiary. 22 Have you given up that argument? 23 MS. BLATT: No. I think that the -- that 24 the whole thrust of the petition -- and obviously the 25 primary argument is that this flouts the implied right
6

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of action jurisprudence and it -- it conflicts with 2 congressional intent in all events. But one of the 3 harms, and sort of illustrating just how bad the 4 decision was, is this conferred rights that the parties 5 never imagined and that the Secretary did not -- did not 6 intend. 7 But I -- I think that, in our view, even if 8 the Secretary had wanted to, it's not the Secretary's 9 decision nor was it the manufacturers' decision to go 10 contract by contract and say this multi-billion dollar 11 health care program that incorporates another, even 12 bigger multi-billion dollar health care program -- we're 13 going to turn this over to Federal enforcement, when on 14 the face of the statute reflects a deliberate decision 15 by Congress to withhold - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Private enforcement. 17 MS. BLATT: Private enforcement -- to 18 withhold a private remedy in favor of 340B entities and, 19 instead, channel exclusive authority to the Secretary to 20 enforce it. And those three specifics, in addition to 21 the disruption, are that Congress gave manufacturers, 22 but not 340B entities, a private reimbursement remedy 23 and a private - 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it -- I'm not 25 sure of the answer, but is it different in this case or
7

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 unusual that the agreement is between the Federal 2 Government and private entities, as opposed to what I 3 think is the more typical situation in which these cases 4 come up, where it's, say, an agreement between the 5 Federal Government and a State? 6 MS. BLATT: Well, all your Medicaid cases, 7 obviously, under State plans - 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 9 MS. BLATT: -- and a lot of your implied 10 right of action jurisprudence is dealing with Spending 11 Clause legislation as to State entities. But there are 12 a number, a number -- the Rehabilitation Act, the 13 Davis-Bacon Act, and a fair number of health care 14 programs -- where the government contracts with private 15 parties as a public welfare mechanism to get to what I 16 think are conceded are beneficiaries. 17 Here, there's a number of beneficiaries. 18 It's not just the 340B entities. It's the patient 19 population that's being served and, obviously, the 20 Federal fisc. So - 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt, would you 22 explain the function that the contract mechanism serves? 23 I mean, you could just have this -- you could just have 24 the statute say: Thou shalt not charge more than the 25 ceiling price. Period.
8

1 What -- what is accomplished by having the 2 contract reflecting the terms of the statute? 3 MS. BLATT: Well, I don't think it's any 4 different than Mobil Oil or Jackson Transit, where 5 Congress wants to specify the terms of the contract, and 6 the contract incorporates in haec verba the statutory 7 terms. And if there's a breach of that, there are 8 contractual remedies that flow. 9 But I agree with you that there's not a 10 whole lot difference between our position and the 11 Government, because the Government is absolutely correct 12 that it's in haec verba and identical, and the statutory 13 obligation that we're talking about that's incorporated 14 into the contract is that a certain ceiling price must 15 be charged. 16 But the -- the other sort of practical 17 function is only manufacturers who enter into this 18 contract are subject to these price controls. So if 19 they -- a pharmaceutical manufacturer doesn't want to 20 participate in the program, they're not covered. 21 And in a typical regulation and I think 22 general sort of Spending Clause analysis, someone who 23 accepts Federal funding has considered sort of implicit 24 consent to the funding obligations because they're 25 taking the money. But here's there's an express
9

1 manifestation both by the Secretary who signed the 2 agreement and the contractors, the pharmaceutical 3 companies who signed the agreement. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Before the statute was 5 amended by I think the Patient Protection Act and there 6 was a breach of the agreement, did the government assess 7 penalties? 8 MS. BLATT: Well - 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because -- and the reason 10 I'm asking this is that you indicate that the government 11 had a contract remedy. It seemed to me it had a 12 regulatory remedy. 13 MS. BLATT: It has got a lot of remedies. 14 It has -- but it - 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What was the contract 16 remedy that it had at the time this case arose, which 17 was before the -- these mechanisms. 18 MS. BLATT: Yes. They're -- right. We are 19 still -- today is no different than yesterday, because 20 nothing has happened to implement the 2010 health care 21 reform except that there are now more civil monetary 22 penalties than there were. 23 But the government has statutory penalties, 24 civil monetary penalties, a right of audit. It can 25 bring suits under the False Claims Act and can terminate
10

1 both this agreement and the Medicaid rebate agreement. 2 But as a -- the government has contractual 3 remedies, too. I mean, why Congress, I think -- a 4 sensible inference for why Congress picked contracts is 5 that this is -- this piggybacks off the Medicaid rebate 6 program, and that uses contracts. And that instead - 7 that in turn, rather, used contracts because the States 8 had negotiated rebate agreements with drug companies way 9 before 1990. And so Congress continued the contract 10 feature. 11 And then, since the pricing components under 12 this program are the same pricing components under the 13 Medicaid rebate program, both programs are parallel and 14 that both use agreement, one is the Medicaid rebate 15 agreement. In this case, it's the pharmaceutical - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Blatt, you said that 17 there's not a whole lot of difference between your 18 position and the Government's. What is the difference 19 between your position and the Government's? 20 MS. BLATT: Well, the Government says a 21 contract is not a contract even though it says it's a 22 contract. Our position is this a contract. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't make much 24 sense, does it? 25 MS. BLATT: The -- the Government sees this,
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 I think, as just a unilateral -- that the manufacturers 2 walked in and said we're here and happy to be bound. 3 But the agreement on its face says the Secretary makes 4 the following agreement; the Secretary promises this. 5 The most important promise the Secretary 6 made to manufacturers is that the Secretary said that 7 she would not terminate the agreement without good 8 cause, 60 days' notice, and certain conduct that the 9 manufacturer did would not constitute grounds for 10 termination. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: What did the manufacturer 12 promise in exchange for a contract? You do need 13 consideration. What did they promise that they weren't 14 already obliged to do by law? 15 MS. BLATT: Well, the billions and billions 16 in price discounts they were not obliged to do unless 17 they -- they signed the contract. But the contract goes 18 through a ton of manufacturer responsibilities. The 19 manufacturer -- if the Secretary thinks that there is 20 reimbursement that's owed, the Secretary can order 21 reimbursement, and the manufacturer has -- it's a - 22 it's a pretty substantial - 23 JUSTICE BREYER: So what is Santa Clara 24 County supposed do? They -- they think they're being 25 overcharged. And in your opinion, they -- the company
12

1 doesn't, but they do. So what are they supposed to do 2 if they're right? How do they get the money? 3 MS. BLATT: Well, the way they have been 4 getting the money, and for better or worse until 2010, 5 they have been at the mercy of the vastly larger 6 Medicaid rebate program, which is run on behalf of the 7 States. And because this program is so small compared 8 to that program, all the enforcement activity, which is 9 all the False Claims Act settlements that Respondent 10 cites in his brief, that's how, as a practical matter, 11 it's been enforced. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm interested in 13 procedurally what are they supposed to do? 14 MS. BLATT: Oh, pick up the phone and either 15 call the manufacturer, the prime vendor - 16 JUSTICE BREYER: The manufacturer says: 17 Okay, you're wrong. I'm not; I'm undercharging you. 18 Now what happens. 19 MS. BLATT: Ultimately, if they can't get 20 the Secretary to - 21 JUSTICE BREYER: He's busy. 22 MS. BLATT: If she's busy and won't return 23 the calls, Congress said you can't enforce it - 24 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, Why can't they -- can 25 they, for example, file a claim with the -- with the

1 Secretary and say we would like the Secretary to order 2 them to give us the money; they're violating this? They 3 go to an administrative law judge. Is there an 4 administrative remedy of some kind that would be 5 reviewable in the courts for reasonableness? 6 MS. BLATT: There's just -- right now, 7 there's just an informal, non-mandatory - 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So why is it 9 reasonable, then, to think that the Secretary would have 10 entered into a contract which is going to benefit them 11 and there's no remedy? 12 MS. BLATT: Because the statute itself said: 13 We're going to go out of our way to give manufacturers 14 remedies, make this confidential; manufacturers have 15 rights of audit, but 340B entities don't. The Secretary 16 -- here's a vast arsenal of things at your disposal, and 17 it's channeled through that regulatory regime. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: But normally under the law 19 from Marbury v. Madison onward, where there's a wrong, 20 there's a remedy. 21 MS. BLATT: But - 22 JUSTICE BREYER: And the remedy could be 23 administrative, could be judicial, et cetera. But 24 you're saying there's none? 25 MS. BLATT: No. I think 30 years have said
14

1 that we're not going down that road. I mean, in 2 Gonzaga, there was a breach of the statutory provision, 3 and students presumably are harmed when private 4 information gets disclosed. But every private right of 5 action case where you've said no, the argument has 6 been - 7 JUSTICE BREYER: But in such cases, there 8 very often is an administrative remedy - 9 MS. BLATT: That's true. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and the person always - 11 any individual in the United States can go ask any 12 agency to do anything, and there is even review in 13 instances of a refusal to withhold -- a withholding of 14 action. 15 MS. BLATT: There's always an APA action 16 against the Secretary. I just think - 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there here? You said 18 there was. 19 MS. BLATT: Well, I think it would be hard 20 to bring an APA action. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about a False 22 Claims Act action? 23 MS. BLATT: Yes. Yes. And False Claims 24 Acts are brought. There's a lot of them, and there's a 25 multitude of settlements that are outlined in the
15

1 briefs. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, to the extent that 3 you're objecting to the disruption of the Secretary, 4 there is disruption when it's a private party bringing a 5 False Claims Act. 6 MS. BLATT: Well, it's not a private party. 7 It's the private party who's assigned the claim. I 8 mean, the case is brought in the name of, and it is a 9 case by the United States. And that's significant 10 because the United States has complete and total control 11 over that case. Here, the problem -- it's bad enough - 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even if the United States 13 doesn't take over the case, just lets the qui tam 14 relator - 15 MS. BLATT: Right. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- proceed? 17 MS. BLATT: Yes, that's right. It's still 18 brought in the name of the United States with heightened 19 pleading requirements, and they actually have to allege 20 a knowing false statement. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you emphasize 22 that the contract has the language in haec verba of the 23 statute. What if -- what if it doesn't? 24 The statute imposes certain provisions. The 25 pricing I guess is the key one. But in a private deal,
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 when you're arranging for the delivery of, you know, 2 pharmaceuticals, you could have a lot of provisions. 3 It's got to be delivered by this much. You've got to 4 have this much inventory. You've got to -- whatever. 5 I mean, what if the contract here included 6 terms beyond those in the statute? Could those be 7 enforced by the third-party beneficiaries? 8 MS. BLATT: Yes. And there is - 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes? 10 MS. BLATT: If it's not enforced in the 11 statute -- only if -- and I think it's significant that 12 plaintiffs always lose under a third-party beneficiary 13 because the bar is so high. The government always 14 enters into contracts on behalf of somebody, and the 15 government rarely intends to confer enforceable rights, 16 and the parties rarely do it. 17 But if you had an express provision outside 18 the statute that said we intend to confer enforceable 19 rights on third parties, and it's not an enforcement of 20 the statute at all, then all your jurisprudence for 21 determining congressional intent aren't being subverted 22 and aren't being undermined. 23 I could give you an example. I mean, it 24 could be anywhere from something just completely outside 25 the statute. Together, the pharmaceutical companies
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 could say we hereby agree to make a contribution every 2 year to the clinic or hospital for a holiday gift. That 3 would be an odd contract. I don't see the Secretary 4 entering into third-party beneficiary contracts. A much 5 more efficient way would just be to contract with the 6 entity itself. 7 But I think this is just another way of 8 saying that a lot of the energy and breath in the court 9 of appeals would be saved in going through why the 10 common law doesn't confer it because congressional 11 intent, by and large, is going to line up with the 12 Secretary, the party's intent. 13 But when you're talking in haec verba, and 14 this could not be more precise because it's the exact - 15 it's actually not even 340B. The allegation is it's a 16 violation of the Medicaid Rebate Act pricing reporting 17 requirements. It's -- congressional intent is all that 18 matters. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this a contract with the 20 Secretary or a contract with the United States executed 21 on behalf of the United States by the Secretary? 22 MS. BLATT: It is a contract executed by 23 HRSA, the administrator of -- an agency within, and he 24 or she, whoever the administrator is at the time, enters 25 it on behalf of the Secretary. So the -

App. starting at around 169. It says the 8 Secretary. And you don't have the signature page, but 9 I've seen them. They're all signed by the administrator 10 of HRSA, which is the -- the organization within HHS, 11 not CMS but HHS, that runs the 340B program. But if I 12 could -- actually, I'll just save the remainder for 13 rebuttal. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 15 Ms. Anders. 16 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D.

ANDERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 20 please the Court: 21 The pharmaceutical pricing agreement should 22 not be construed to permit 340B entities to bring suit 23 to enforce drug manufacturers' price reporting 24 requirements for two reasons: First, the PPA is not an 25 ordinary contract, and it does not transform the 340B
19

1 program from a regulatory scheme into a contractual one. 2 Like a Medicare provider - 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it -- is it a 4 contract at all? 5 MS. ANDERS: It's not an ordinary contract 6 in that it doesn't give rise to contract rights in 7 the -- in the regulated entities. This is very similar 8 to Medicare provider agreements, in which a health care 9 provider who wants to enter into the Medicare program 10 and provide services agrees -- signs an agreement in 11 which he agrees to abide by the statutes and regulations 12 set forth in the Medicare program and, in return for 13 that agreement, is given the opportunity to participate 14 in the Medicaid -- in the Medicare program. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how do we distinguish 16 between what you call an ordinary contract and this sort 17 of a contract, if it's any kind of contract? 18 MS. ANDERS: Well, I think when the statute 19 directs an agency to enter into an agreement for the 20 sole purpose of memorializing the parties' opt-in to the 21 regulatory scheme and directs -- directs what the terms 22 shall be, so here provides statutorily what the 23 reporting requirements will be, that's when the 24 contract is simply a regulatory mechanism. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, are you telling
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 me you're taking -- then your -- then your co-counsel is 2 right; you're agreeing with her totally. If Congress 3 wrote the statute, said these are the terms we want to 4 give you in a contract, you figure out how to implement 5 and enforce this, and the Secretary says I don't have 6 the resources to enforce this, I'm going to write a 7 contract that gives the 340B entities a private cause of 8 action, the manufacturers can take it or leave it - 9 you're taking the position that the Secretary is without 10 authority to do this? 11 MS. ANDERS: I think it would be a difficult 12 question. I think it would be a difficult argument to 13 say that the Secretary was completely without authority. 14 I think what has happened here is the Secretary has 15 reasonably interpreted the statute in providing for an 16 agreement between the Secretary and the manufacturers to 17 simply mark the opt-in. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that begs the 19 question that Justice Alito asked you, which is: If we 20 go your route, which is, is this a regulatory or some 21 sort of other contract, how do we tell the difference, 22 and do we need to go that far? Isn't your position -- I 23 thought half of your -- other half of your position was 24 that this is not a third-party intended beneficiary. 25 All the terms of the contract are between
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the manufacturer and the Secretary and the obligations 2 to the Secretary, not the obligations to the third 3 parties. 4 MS. ANDERS: That's exactly right. I 5 think -- to take the first part of your question, I 6 think the Court can tell when this is a regulatory 7 contract when the statute itself simply directs the 8 agency to enter into an agreement that -- that contains 9 the terms that are set forth in the statute. And when 10 you look at the statutory scheme as a whole, it is a 11 regulatory scheme. 12 The government is not acting as a 13 contracting party here. It's acting as a regulator. It 14 has the authority to impose administrative penalties 15 which would be reviewed under the APA. There's no 16 transaction that's taking place with the government. 17 The only rules governing the conduct are statutory. So 18 that's why we think you can tell that this is not an 19 ordinary contract. It's a regulatory one. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there a different - 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You mean -- you mean 22 there's no negotiated element to it? It's what the 23 statute -- it's the same as Ms. Blatt said? It's -- the 24 contract repeats the words, the terms of the statute, 25 and that's it; is that what you mean?
22

1 MS. ANDERS: That's right. This isn't a 2 negotiated agreement. The Secretary has simply repeated 3 the terms of the statute in the agreement. That's 4 exactly right. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You could do this, I 6 guess, by regulation, right? 7 MS. ANDERS: I think that would be one way. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Issue a regulation 9 saying manufacturers who participate in this program 10 agree to do, you know, whatever your contract says. 11 MS. ANDERS: I think that would be one way 12 to do it, yes. Throughout this area, though, Congress 13 has often used agreements to mark entry into the 14 regulatory scheme, including in the Medicare provider 15 area, where you do have these agreements with health 16 care providers. But it would be very odd, then, to say 17 that the -- the entire area is regulated by breach of 18 contract law rather than by the, you know, hundreds of 19 pages of regulations and statutory provisions that 20 govern the providers' rights there. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: Could you tell us whether 22 you agree with the Petitioner's argument in part D of 23 its brief that private suits would seriously disrupt the 24 comprehensive statutory scheme, in light of the position 25 that the Government has taken in other litigation
23

1 involving actions brought by States, In re 2 Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price 3 Litigation in the District of Massachusetts? 4 MS. ANDERS: We do agree with the 5 Petitioners that -- that permitting third-party 6 beneficiary suits here, if you construe this as a 7 contract, would interfere with the government's ability 8 to administer the statutory scheme. This is a national 9 pricing scheme that's put together by the Medicaid 10 Rebate Act, which has -- which is heavily regulated. 11 Allowing 14,000 covered entities to bring individual 12 suits in different courts without HHS consultation, 13 without the benefit of the government's input, could 14 lead to substantial dis-uniformity despite the fact that 15 these are supposed to be national prices. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're walking away from 17 your position in the District of Massachusetts? The 18 States do not have, according to you, the right to 19 enforce the rebate program? 20 MS. ANDERS: No. That's actually an 21 important point. I think in the Medicaid context the 22 States have a cooperative relationship with the Federal 23 Government. And so they receive some of these funds 24 directly, and they have -- in fact, in the Medicaid Act, 25 it is contemplated that they have their own enforcement

ANDERS: Those are actually State law 9 suits that were involved in the Average Wholesale 10 Price - 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is that regulatory 12 scheme any different than the one involving the PPA? 13 MS. ANDERS: Well, the Medicaid Act itself 14 gives States an enforcement responsibility and says that 15 they are to use their efforts to find fraud and the 16 prosecute it. And so States actually have a whole body 17 of State law, State law false claims act - 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that the State of 19 California says we'd like our counties to be able to 20 enforce this. Then what happens? 21 MS. ANDERS: Under the Medicaid Act, there 22 would be - 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose that 24 California -- if California wants to say we could bring 25 this suit like Massachusetts did, you agree they could.

ANDERS: Well, we think it's very 5 different when you have covered entities - 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what's the difference 7 between - 8 MS. ANDERS: -- bringing even a fraud suit. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: What's the difference 10 between a State doing it itself through its attorney 11 general and the State saying we'd like the county to do 12 it through its county attorney? 13 MS. ANDERS: Well, there's consultation with 14 the Federal Government at the front end when the State 15 -- when the State brings a suit. And so the government 16 has a chance to coordinate, to avoid dis-uniformity. 17 But when you have covered entities, you know, thousands 18 of them, potentially bringing suit in different - 19 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. California 20 comes to you tomorrow and says the attorney general 21 says: You know, this is a problem. You don't have time 22 to enforce this. There should be some enforcement, and 23 we want to enforce it. And, moreover, we'd like each 24 county affected to enforce it. 25 Do you have the authority? Is there any

1 reason you wouldn't say go ahead? 2 MS. ANDERS: Well, in that sort of 3 situation, you might be able to have a State law fraud 4 suit - 5 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to analogize it 6 to the Massachusetts one. You say they can just go 7 ahead and do it, and they say, you know, Santa Clara 8 County is just as big as Rhode Island. And you say the 9 AG of Rhode Island can bring the suit; am I right? And 10 so why can't the -- why can't Santa Clara do it? 11 MS. ANDERS: Well, in the covered entity 12 context, the concern is that, because you have so many 13 of them, if you -- if you start permitting covered 14 entities to bring suit, you know, this is essentially a 15 pre-emption question, but you then have 50 different 16 State regimes, State court regimes, put onto -- grafted 17 onto, the Medicaid rebate requirements. 18 This is supposed to be a uniform pricing 19 scheme. And so once the requirements become 20 dis-uniform, it becomes very difficult for HHS to 21 administer the scheme in the way that it's supposed to. 22 I think it's also important to point out 23 that the recently enacted Affordable Care Act will 24 provide the exclusive administrative remedy for claims 25 exactly like Respondent's once HHS puts that into

1 effect. So Congress, in looking at the scheme, to the 2 extent it had concerns about enforcement by covered 3 entities -- the way it reacted was not to create a 4 private right of action or provide for breach of 5 contract enforcement but was simply to give the agency 6 enhanced authority in order to adjudicate the claims 7 itself. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It identified the 9 problem that the individual beneficiaries did not have a 10 remedy? They -- or that courts had indicated that they 11 didn't and they thought there should be a remedy? 12 MS. ANDERS: There were -- there were OIG 13 reports raising concerns with oversight and enforcement 14 at a general level, and the way Congress reacted to that 15 was to put in place this administrative remedy which 16 will allow covered entities to bring these claims and 17 will allow HHS to have the first opportunity to 18 determine the meaning of the AMP and best price 19 requirements, and to take into account - 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt said nothing 21 has been done. It just went into effect on January 1st, 22 but are there -- are there plans to implement it? 23 MS. ANDERS: Yes. The agency is moving 24 ahead with that. The agency has already issued an 25 advanced notice of proposed rulemaking back in the fall.

1 And it has solicited comments about how the -- the 2 administrative scheme should look. That comment period 3 has closed, and so now the agency is in the process 4 of -- of moving forward with the regulatory - 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I understand your 6 position clearly, in a regulatory contract situation 7 like this one the Secretary is without authority to 8 decide he or she can't enforce the statute and to confer 9 expressly by contract third-party beneficiary rights to 10 the -- to the people receiving the benefit? That's the 11 position you're taking? 12 If the Secretary had written a provision 13 into this contract telling 340B entities you can sue, 14 that would have been, according to you, ultra vires? 15 MS. ANDERS: I think it would be difficult 16 to say that the agency would have been totally without 17 authority to do that. It's not a question you have to 18 answer here, because I think the PPA clearly shouldn't 19 be construed to confer third-party beneficiary rights 20 because that would be inconsistent with the statutory 21 scheme. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 23 Mr. Frederick. 24 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK 25 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief 2 Justice. 3 I'd like to start with Ms. Blatt's answer to 4 your question about whether a provision of the agreement 5 here could confer third-party beneficiary rights. She 6 said yes, so long as the wording wasn't specifically 7 prescribed by Congress. In so doing, she concedes that 8 this is a contract, that normal rules of contract law 9 apply, that the fact that the Secretary has entered into 10 the contract is of no moment, and that third-party 11 beneficiary rights are an inherent part of normal 12 contract principles. 13 So now we're left with the question, does it 14 matter that Congress wrote the particular words that the 15 Secretary used in the agreement? 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. Is the - 17 MR. FREDERICK: We submit that the answer is 18 no. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Third-party beneficiary 20 rights are part of normal contracts, but the third-party 21 beneficiary has rights under -- under the normal 22 contract only when the parties intend him to have 23 rights. It's not that every -- every contract which - 24 which has a benefit for some person allows that person 25 to sue. There has to be an intent. And I -- I have
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 trouble finding that intent here, either on the -- on 2 the part of the Secretary -- would the Secretary have 3 had that intent when -- when Congress clearly did -- did 4 not have the intent to allow private individuals to sue? 5 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, you find the 6 intent in part II(a) of the agreement, which is set 7 forth in the petition appendix. And in part II(a), the 8 manufacturer who agrees voluntarily to enter into this 9 agreement agrees that the entity -- that the entity will 10 be charged only a set ceiling price. 11 That is a voluntary agreement of a duty by 12 the manufacturer that runs to the third-party 13 beneficiary covered entities - 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, you didn't -- you 15 didn't hear my question. 16 MR. FREDERICK: -- who are specified in the 17 agreement. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: My question was the mere 19 fact that there's a duty to a third party in the normal 20 contract does not give that third party the right to 21 sue, only if the contracting parties intend the 22 third-party beneficiary to have a right to sue. 23 MR. FREDERICK: Well, that's not the 24 standard, Justice Scalia. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I thought the -
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. FREDERICK: The standard for a 2 third-party beneficiary, as set forth in the Restatement 3 and as recognized by this Court, is whether or not the 4 parties objectively intended to create intended 5 third-party beneficiaries whose right to bring the suit 6 would enforce the contract. And that's precisely what 7 we have here. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick - 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me where - 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I thought when this 11 case went back to the -- to the district court, the - 12 the agency's position was this is a total surprise to 13 us, 14,000 suits or whatever it is. No, we never -- we 14 never envisioned making the individual whatever you call 15 them -- the 430B - 16 MR. FREDERICK: The 340B entities. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We never envisioned 18 making them the beneficiaries and -- and allowing them 19 to sue. That would be quite disruptive of our program. 20 That, I thought, was the position the Government took. 21 MR. FREDERICK: The Government cannot argue 22 for subjective intent of an agreement written 18 years 23 ago. This Court's decisions in contract have always 24 held that the objective intent as expressed by the words 25 of the contract are what courts are to construe.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I don't 2 understand why what Justice Scalia said isn't the same 3 as what you said. You said no, Justice Scalia, 4 Restatement of Contracts. But what he said the question 5 is whether or not did the parties intend -- and it's an 6 objective intent -- to confer these rights on a third 7 person. And -- and you said no, no, that's not it. But 8 then it seems to me that your answer that you gave was 9 just what Justice Scalia said. I -- I missed something. 10 MR. FREDERICK: Okay. Here's what I think I 11 misunderstood perhaps from Justice Scalia's question. 12 For third-party beneficiary rights to create an 13 enforceable breach of contract claim, the parties to the 14 contract do not have to have a provision in the contract 15 saying "and therefore the intended third parties get to 16 bring a breach of contract claim." That's never been 17 the accepted law. 18 The law has always said if the parties 19 intend to create third-party beneficiaries and bringing 20 of that suit to enforce the contract would be within the 21 objective intent of the parties, such a suit is 22 permissible. 23 Now, I want to caution that what is 24 different about this suit from the kinds of implied 25 rights of action suits that the drug companies here
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 claim to be so disruptive is that all we're arguing for 2 is the bargain that the manufacturers agreed to 3 undertake. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: Could that be -- could there 5 be - 6 MR. FREDERICK: That bargain was -- was the 7 discount. It's the delta between what the counties paid 8 and what they should have paid under the discount 9 program ceiling price arrangement in the plain terms of 10 the agreement. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could there be - 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Third-party -- I'm 13 sorry. 14 JUSTICE ALITO: Could there be a 15 third-party -- a suit by an intended beneficiary and a 16 purported intended beneficiary, if it is clear that 17 Congress intended, to the extent it can intend 18 something, for those beneficiaries to get the benefit of 19 the price but did not intend for them to be able to sue? 20 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: So if there were - 22 MR. FREDERICK: I think indirectly here, 23 Justice Alito, that the patients here certainly are 24 incidental beneficiaries, insofar as those who can't 25 afford to pay for the drugs get them for free at the
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 county's expense. This is county money that we're 2 talking about here. Or if they have some limited 3 insurance, they're able to get the drugs at a discount. 4 So they are certainly incidental 5 beneficiaries, but because they are not named and 6 because the intent of the program is to provide the 340B 7 entities with discounted drugs so they can extend scarce 8 dollars farther, they have no right to sue. 9 JUSTICE ALITO: If there were a provision in 10 the law saying expressly there is no private right of 11 action under this statute, would you be able to make the 12 same argument? 13 MR. FREDERICK: No. Our argument rests on 14 the silence of contract with respect to how enforcement 15 would concur. It has long been the case, though, that 16 where the parties intend to displace a third-party 17 beneficiary's rights, the objective intent of the -- of 18 the agreement is what is understood. 19 JUSTICE ALITO: There's - 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -- I'm sorry. I 21 don't understand the distinction that you're ignoring in 22 the law. I thought it was very clear that proof that 23 you merely received the benefit in a -- by a contract is 24 not proof that the parties intended to confer on you an 25 enforceable right; is that correct? Is that the
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 statement of the common law? 2 MR. FREDERICK: That is how the Restatement 3 frames it. It's a -- it is a difficult line I think 4 sometimes to understand the difference between an 5 intended beneficiary and an incidental beneficiary. 6 Certainly, the manufacturers here are incidental 7 beneficiaries - 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No matter how - 9 MR. FREDERICK: -- because they have access 10 to this market. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No matter how you want 12 to draw this line, if the issue is what's the objective 13 intent about enforceability, if I look at the PPA, it 14 makes the manufacturer's obligation one-way to the 15 government to provide the pricing information. It gives 16 only the government the right to institute the informal 17 dispute resolution system that the contract specifies. 18 This is not the new law. This is the PPA as it existed 19 at the time. It gives only the Secretary other 20 enforcement rights. 21 What am I missing? Where in the contract is 22 there one provision, one sentence, one anything that 23 requires the manufacturers, other than the price 24 benefit, to do something that could be characterized as 25 enforcement?
36

1 MR. FREDERICK: But that is the key, 2 Justice Sotomayor. The price discount is where all the 3 action is in this program. These prices, between 1990 4 and 1992, were being raised by the drug manufacturers as 5 against these entities, and the whole point of Congress 6 enacting this statute was to confer the same discounted 7 drug program to the covered entities as had been done 8 through contracts to the State Medicaid rebate program. 9 And that's why the provision in the 10 amendment -- sorry, in the agreement that says thou 11 shalt not charge the covered entities more than the 12 ceiling price is exactly where you find the intended 13 third-party beneficiary rights, because that's their 14 money that's being spent. It's not Federal - 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's true -- that's 16 true, you know, of -- I was thinking maximum resale 17 price maintenance. You could -- the distributor and the 18 manufacturer agree on the maximum resale price. Pretty 19 unlikely that they intend the consumers who are intended 20 to benefit to be able to have a lawsuit. And I think, 21 well, gee, I don't know. And what the Government is 22 arguing is, sure, the point you make favors you, but 23 they say there are two major points here that favor them 24 about background. I want to hear what your reply is. 25 One of them is Congress, in the statute that
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 it incorporated here, didn't want a private person to be 2 able to enforce it. And the second one is it's going to 3 create a mess. All right? So they say those are two 4 background features here that favor them. 5 So what's your response? 6 MR. FREDERICK: Number one, there's no 7 evidence that Congress intended there to be a departure 8 from normal operating contract principles, and this 9 Court, in Winstar, in Mobil Oil, in Jackson Transit, in 10 Central Airlines -- all said that when Congress uses 11 contracts or agreements, it intends to incorporate the 12 full cluster of the common law rights as they've 13 existed. And third-party beneficiary rights have been 14 recognized for 350 years, even before the founding of 15 this republic. 16 Now, as to the disruption, I think it's a 17 canard, because what we're talking about here is one 18 price that would govern all 14,500 covered entities. So 19 if Santa Clara gets the discount price for Lipitor, say, 20 that is the best price, and it will be charged and 21 chargeable to all of the 340B entities across the 22 nation. 23 So in terms of administrability, one suit 24 actually can solve the deficiencies in the government 25 enforcement program, and the government can participate
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 in this suit. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, which way does 3 that cut? That seems to me to put an awful lot of power 4 and authority in the hands of one beneficiary and one 5 lawyer saying -- all they have to do is filing a suit 6 saying, look, we get a hundred doses of Lipitor from 7 this program; we think we should get less. 8 And if they win, the whole country's -- the 9 pricing of Lipitor under this program has changed. 10 MR. FREDERICK: Well - 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That strikes me as 12 an argument in favor of leaving the enforcement with the 13 Secretary. 14 MR. FREDERICK: No, I think it's an argument 15 that may misunderstand some of the benefits that class 16 action practice can provide, where there is a uniform 17 way of analyzing the problem, because these prices, 18 Mr. Chief Justice - 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't have to 20 be a class action, does it? 21 MR. FREDERICK: Well, it doesn't. This was 22 brought as one for the efficiency purpose of obtaining 23 exactly the effect that you are identifying, which 24 is that if it is more efficient - 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's why it was
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 brought as a class action? 2 MR. FREDERICK: Well, it was brought as a 3 class action because the County of Santa Clara stands in 4 exactly the same position as the other 57 counties of 5 California and the other counties in the United States 6 who are overpaying for drugs that the manufacturers 7 are - 8 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think 9 about -- is the -- I'm not sure I'm right at all here, 10 but as I understand the development of this argument 11 today, it's open to you and the other 57 counties to go 12 to the State AG, and you say you bring the lawsuit, 13 okay? Or make us -- make me -- the lawyer says make me 14 an assistant AG for this purpose. And I launch the 15 lawsuit in the name of California, and then I can get to 16 the same place. 17 What do you think of that? 18 MR. FREDERICK: I don't know that the 19 State -- because these are entities that are not defined 20 in the agreement. The -- this is a different agreement 21 than under the Medicaid rebate agreement, which is set 22 forth in the joint appendix, where the States are the 23 third-party beneficiaries of those agreements. 24 I'm not sure that the State actually has 25 standing to bring these particular claims. That is not
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 something that has been tested. But what I would say is 2 that if you reject our argument here, you are 3 substantially undercutting the ability of the States to 4 bring the same kinds of overcharging claims against drug 5 manufacturers under the Medicaid rebate program. 6 That's what the States' amicus brief here 7 makes clear. The SG has a very fuzzy footnote at the 8 very end of the Government's brief that does not set 9 forth a clear standard that differentiates why 340B 10 entities' third-party beneficiary rights are any 11 different from States' rights under the Medicaid rebate 12 program. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it was because 14 the States have been given a role in the statute itself, 15 where the 340B entities have not. I thought that was 16 the -- the Government's position, that the States have a 17 role in the Medicaid program, and that's an entirely 18 different thing than this program, where these entities 19 have no statutory role, say the drug manufacturers and 20 then HHS. 21 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, I don't 22 think that was the basis for Judge Saris's opinion in 23 the District of Massachusetts, which looked at the 24 third-party beneficiary theory of the States in giving 25 them a place at the table in bringing these kinds of
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 claims. And to the extent that that analysis bears out 2 anything, it tends to cast doubt on the Government's 3 theory that these are somehow regulatory contracts that 4 suggest a blurring of the normal lines between 5 regulation and contract. 6 That theory, the regulatory contract theory, 7 has been rejected by this Court in Winstar and in Mobil 8 Oil, where the Government tried to argue that because it 9 was implementing regulatory policy through contracts, 10 somehow normal contract principles don't apply, and this 11 Court rejected that. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the Government's 13 footnote doesn't -- doesn't rely on the contract. It 14 says that -- and it wasn't purporting to say the basis 15 that the court applied in the District of Massachusetts 16 case, but it was explaining why, in the Government's 17 view, it's a different situation. 18 And what it said, it's a different 19 situation, not because of a different contract, but 20 because in that other situation, Medicaid -- the 21 Medicaid rebate -- Medicaid generally is, quote, "a 22 cooperative Federal-State program." 23 I mean, their point is that the States are 24 explicitly given authority for enforcement in that. 25 MR. FREDERICK: Well, the -
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE SCALIA: And here the entities 2 you're representing are not. 3 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, and that is 4 why resort to the normal canons of construction that 5 this Court has long applied to government contracts is 6 what is most pertinent here. The Government, I don't 7 think, can point to a specific provision of the 8 cooperative federalism that empowers States to engage in 9 any greater enforcement power than a normal third-party 10 beneficiary under this Court's normal cases, and back to 11 Central Airlines and American Surety, which, a hundred 12 years ago, recognized a third-party beneficiary's right 13 to bring suit on a breach of contract and held that the 14 absence of a specific enforcement power in the statute 15 was not enough to deny the normal operation of law for 16 the breached party to sue for that breach. 17 That's common in the law. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: The big -- the big 19 difference, it seems to me, Mr. Frederick, is that the 20 States are sovereign. They can enforce their own laws. 21 The entities at issue here are not sovereigns. They're 22 not enforcing their own laws. They are trying to 23 enforce Federal law. But under the -- under the 24 Medicaid program, the States, using their own fraud - 25 fraud actions, whatever else, have a role to play.
43

1 MR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Scalia, I 2 think if you took that argument to its logical extreme, 3 you would have come to a different answer in the Arthur 4 Andersen case, where, there, you recognized a 5 third-party beneficiary's right to invoke a statute to 6 get an arbitration agreement upheld. 7 And I think you would have come to a 8 different result in the Miree v. DeKalb County case, in 9 which the Court said that just because there is an FAA 10 contract with a local airport authority does not deny a 11 third-party beneficiary right to sue if there is an 12 adverse effect on adjoining land because you would have 13 said that, because the adjoining land owner had no 14 specific enforcement authority, that person or entity 15 would be out of luck. I think the -- this Court's - 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's Miree. 17 That's 1977. And a lot of your argument, it seems to 18 me, is in the earlier world of implied right of action 19 jurisprudence that has changed dramatically in the last 20 30 years. 21 And what concerns me is when you are talking 22 about the same language, the mere fact that the 23 government has decided to go through a contractual 24 mechanism to advance this program doesn't allow you to 25 use that to get an end run around all of the implied
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 right of action jurisprudence of the last 30 years. 2 You're on stronger ground before that. 3 MR. FREDERICK: Well, let me address that 4 directly, Mr. Chief Justice, because Justice Rehnquist, 5 who was not any fan of implied rights of action, was the 6 author for the Court's opinion in the Miree decision. 7 And - 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that was 9 pretty well -- that analysis was certainly consistent 10 with the established jurisprudence in this area then. 11 But it started changing very quickly thereafter -- I 12 think about 1980 -- and then consistently went in the 13 other direction, to the point now where I think the 14 jurisprudence is pretty clear that we're not going to 15 imply a private right of action at all. 16 MR. FREDERICK: We're not asking you to 17 imply a private right of action, Mr. Chief Justice. 18 We're asking you to honor contract principles that have 19 long - 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The result is the same, 21 Mr. Frederick. And that's -- I mean, it was a central 22 point in this last brief. You can call it whatever you 23 want. It's -- Congress has not provided for a private 24 right of action to enforce the terms of the statute. 25 The contract embodies the terms of statute. So it would
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 be passing strange if Congress, as we now read Congress, 2 said we want private parties out of this; this is to be 3 between the agency and the manufacturer to say. The 4 same exact result. The same aim can be achieved through 5 this third-party beneficiary route. And I think that 6 said, that is the -- I mean, that is what stands out 7 about this case. 8 And so how do you respond to that? What's 9 the difference between suing because the statute has 10 been violated and suing because the contract has been 11 violated? 12 MR. FREDERICK: A contract is a voluntary 13 agreement entered into between the drug manufacturer and 14 the Secretary. The manufacturer can choose not to 15 participate. 16 So in every one of the implied right of 17 action cases that you have dealt with, a -- an outside 18 entity has been forced to comply with a statute or law. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the statute wouldn't 20 apply to someone who doesn't want to be in the program. 21 MR. FREDERICK: But the -- Justice Ginsburg, 22 those cases all involve the imposition of duties on the 23 part of an entity or actor out in society. 24 Here we're talking about voluntary action. 25 The drug manufacturers can decide not to participate and
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 not sign the agreement. 2 And they have the right, under the 3 provisions allowing termination, to terminate the 4 agreement at will with no reason whatsoever. But - 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But so do the - 6 it's the same situation with the States under Spending 7 Clause legislation. They don't have to sign up, but if 8 they do, then the issue is, is there an implied right of 9 action on the beneficiaries? And our cases for the last 10 25, 30 years have said no. 11 MR. FREDERICK: But the remedy is different, 12 Mr. Chief Justice. And that is a key difference. All 13 we're talking about here as a remedy is the difference 14 between what they promised to charge and what they 15 actually charged. The remedies - 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're told that 17 whatever you say -- that's all we're talking about. We 18 are told that computing the price is a very intricate 19 business and that many of these disputes have been about 20 what is -- what should the ceiling price be. 21 MR. FREDERICK: There - 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There would not -- the 23 ceiling price is out there, and there's no dispute about 24 it. It's just a question of getting the manufacturers 25 to charge that price and not a higher price. The
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 question is: What is the ceiling price? 2 MR. FREDERICK: And there are two ways to 3 calculate it. Under the more complicated formula that 4 is designed to enhance the profits of the drug 5 companies, it is a more complicated endeavor. 6 All of these cases, Justice Ginsburg, all of 7 them, have been with the simple formula, which is has 8 the drug company given its best price to some other 9 purchaser in the market. That's where the False Claims 10 Act cases that they acknowledge do not create such an 11 intrusion into the program that somehow they can't be 12 brought - 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- and then 14 they have control over them. And they don't have 15 control over these suits. 16 MR. FREDERICK: Well, no, the difference in 17 a qui tam case, as your question earlier to my colleague 18 earlier acknowledged, Justice Ginsburg, is the 19 government doesn't have to intervene in a False Claims 20 Act case. 21 What's different there is that there has to 22 be some inside whistleblower who can pass through the 23 very difficult hurdles of a False Claims Act case; 24 whereas here we're talking about benefit of the bargain. 25 The manufacturers agreed by contract they were only

1 going to charge a ceiling price, and we assert, based 2 on, you know, quite extensive reports by officers of 3 Inspectorate General that they have not been charging 4 that price. They've been charging in excess of that 5 price, and all we're asking for is the delta. 6 And the Government in its Massachusetts 7 submissions has acknowledged that this type of best 8 price litigation is not so complicated because all one 9 needs to do is figure out did the drug companies sell 10 the particular drug to some other entity for a lower 11 price; and if that's so, that's the price you apply 12 across the board to all the 340B entities. 13 The argument about distraction and 14 intrusion, Justice Ginsburg, I would respectfully 15 submit, is a gross overstatement of what actually 16 happens in this type of litigation. And to the extent 17 that there are complexities, the complexities are 18 introduced by the drug companies for the sole purpose of 19 masking what price they are charging to the 340B 20 entities. Because all these various mechanisms, the 21 bundling of drugs, the use of kickbacks and payments to 22 purchasers are all designed to mask what the true price 23 of the drug is. 24 And if Congress intended anything in the 25 program, and in getting the Secretary to implement this
49

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 program through statutes, it was that the 340B entities 2 who are providing drugs and medical service to the 3 poorest of our citizens should be entitled to the 4 benefits of the collective market created by these 340B 5 drug purchases. And that's all that we're asking for 6 here. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you take the position 8 that nothing has changed as a result of the new 9 legislation? That is, Ms. Anders told us that this 10 statute is going into -- to become effective. There's 11 going to be procedures, better procedures than there 12 were before. Is there still this third-party 13 beneficiary suit, despite the possibility of going to 14 the agency? 15 MR. FREDERICK: We don't know, Justice 16 Ginsburg, is the simple and plainest answer I can give 17 you. And the reason we don't know is because the 18 Secretary has already missed the first statutory 19 deadline for issuing implementing regulations. 20 There was no statement of rules in the 21 notice of proposed rulemaking, as is ordinarily the case 22 for agencies. The Secretary simply put out for comment 23 that we are going to develop procedures and rules. So 24 we don't know whether or not the Secretary will express 25 some further intent as to how these new rules are to
50

1 apply. 2 But I would submit that this Court's cases 3 are very clear, that a later enactment of Congress is 4 not intent of what an earlier Congress has stated, and 5 the absence of any specific remedial provision coupled 6 with the use of agreements carries with it the ordinary 7 presumption that Congress intended for that cluster of 8 common law rights to be associated with the agreement. 9 And that's certainly been the way this Court 10 has enforced contracts involving the government itself. 11 If there are no further questions, we'll 12 submit. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 14 Frederick. 15 Ms. Blatt, you have 3 minutes remaining. 16 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT 17 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 18 MS. BLATT: Yes. If I could just talk about 19 the drug companies, Lipitor, and the common law. And if 20 you want, I can also talk about States. 21 We take, obviously, deep umbrage at the 22 suggestion that the drug companies are somehow against 23 these clinics. Any Internet search will show you that 24 the amount of discounts given under this program equals 25 the amount of free drugs that are given to these same
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 clinics. 2 And I'd also -- probably even a better 3 response is you can look at any rebate release issued by 4 the Secretary of HHS or any page of their CFR, and if 5 you think it's simple, I would be shocked. 6 On Lipitor, it's not the case that the 7 Central District of California decides nationwide what 8 the price of Lipitor is. The -- under the other side's 9 view, the Southern District of Texas, the Northern 10 District of New York, and the District in Alabama would 11 all decide. 12 And what's really bad -- it is bad enough to 13 have 14,000 suits over 35,000 drugs, but what he's 14 talking about, best price and average manufacturer price 15 that determines the State rebate program -- because the 16 rebate program is a rebate, and the ceiling price 17 program is a ceiling price, when one of the pricing 18 components goes up, such as average manufacturer price, 19 the States benefit. They get more money. But, 20 generally, 340B entities -- their ceiling price goes up. 21 So what's good for the 340B company -- or entity is bad 22 for the States. 23 And that's not disputed. He just says it's 24 hypothetical. But he's asked for millions and millions 25 and millions and millions and more millions of
52

1 transactions that go to that very pricing component. 2 Common law. On pages 9 to 11a of the 3 petition appendix is a good three or four citations to 4 the third-party beneficiary Federal common law. And the 5 courts go out of their way to say it's not enough to be 6 a direct beneficiary. The analysis is exactly the same 7 under implied right of action. Is there clear and 8 unambiguous intent to confer enforceable rights? It's 9 the same. 10 We just think because it's in haec verba 11 with the statute, it's congressional intent that's 12 controlling, not the parties. 13 I could talk about States if you want. 14 Otherwise, I'm happy to just ask for the decision to be 15 reversed. 16 All right. Then we would ask that the 17 decision be reversed. 18 (Laughter.) 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 20 Counsel. 21 The case is submitted. 22 (Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the 23 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 24 25
