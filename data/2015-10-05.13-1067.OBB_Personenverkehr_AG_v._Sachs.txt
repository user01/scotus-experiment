3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 first this morning, first this term, in Case 131067,

5 OBB Personenverkehr v. Sachs.

6             Mr. Basombrio.

7            ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUAN C. BASOMBRIO

8               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10 it please the Court:

11             This personal injury action is based upon an

12 accident that occurred in Austria.  If this Court

13 agrees, there's no need to reach the other question

14 related to agency, so I will start first with the

15 basedupon issue.

16             In Nelson, this Court set forth a framework

17 to analyze the basedupon question.  And this Court held

18 that courts must begin their analysis by identifying the

19 particular conduct on which the action is based.  The

20 decision uses words such as basis, foundation, and

21 gravamen.  So here 

22             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But in  in that case,

23 there was a distinction between State activity  that

24 is, police activity  and the commercial activity in

25 hiring the plaintiff.  Here, I think it's conceded that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
4 1 the activity  running a railroad  that's commercial. 2 So we don't have the commercial/State action division. 3             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Yes, Your Honor, that's 4 correct.  Here, there are two alleged commercial 5 activities.  One of them is the sale of the ticket in 6 the United States, and the other one are the acts and 7 omissions that resulted in the accident in Austria. 8             So what I would suggest is that we look at 9 the complaint and see what it is that the plaintiff has 10 alleged. 11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just as a matter of 12 background, suppose a hypothetical case  no foreign 13 sovereign.  It was a private corporation in Austria. 14 Would there then be jurisdiction under the Due Process 15 Clause in your view?  You don't have to prevail on  on 16 that issue, but as a background issue, what  do you 17 have a position? 18             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Our position is that if OBB 19 was a private entity, there would not be jurisdiction 20 over OBB.  There would not be general jurisdiction after 21 this Court holding in Daimler and there would also  22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And Daimler is your best 23 case for that proposition? 24             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Yes, Your Honor. 25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do  do you think that it's
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
5 1 the same test?  In other words, is the test a specific 2 jurisdiction test here, basedon, arisingfrom, that we 3 are basically asking the same question as we would be 4 asking if this were a  a foreign corporation? 5             MR. BASOMBRIO:  I don't believe so, Your 6 Honor.  Let me explain, if I may, why not.  Congress 7 could have chosen that wording in the personal 8 jurisdiction analysis in the case law, but they decided 9 on another phrase, basedupon, instead.  So I believe 10 that what this Court needs to do is give some 11 guidance  12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but why  I mean, it 13 doesn't seem to me that that wording is very different 14 from the wording that we've used in specific 15 jurisdiction cases.  The wording here is "based on"  16 we've used "arising out of."  Sometimes we've used 17 "related to."  In some respects  I mean, it's pretty 18 clear that the FSIA is meant to ensure that when a 19 foreign government is acting as a commercial actor, it 20 gets treated like a foreign corporation.  And the 21 language here is very similar, right?  There's the 22 insistence on a sufficient contact, a minimum contact, 23 and then there is the insistence on a particular kind of 24 relationship between that contact  contact and the 25 claim.

6 1             So it seems  I guess the question is:  Why 2 should we think of these two questions as at all 3 different?  And I don't know, by the way, I mean, that 4 it would hurt you if they were the same, because it 5 might just be there would be no specific jurisdiction 6 here, you know?  But I guess I'm having trouble of 7 thinking why it is that there  that there would be a 8 different test. 9             MR. BASOMBRIO:  The reason why is because 10 the FSIA takes place of the  both the subject matter 11 jurisdiction analysis and the personal jurisdiction 12 analysis.  Both are combined into one test.  So although 13 I would agree certainly that some aspects of the 14 personal jurisdictional analysis are part of that test, 15 it goes beyond that.  It also goes into subject matter 16 jurisdiction which is a different set of policy 17 determinations that Congress made that are in some way 18 overlapping of the personal jurisdiction questions, but 19 I don't think they're completely aligned. 20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  I'm sorry. 21 I'm  I don't even understand why we're talking about 22 basedupon. 23             As Justice Ginsburg said, there's no dispute 24 here that whether the basedupon is the ticket sale or 25 the operation of the train, both of them are commercial

2             Isn't the work in substantial contact with

3 the United States?  Isn't that what we should be looking

4 at instead?  Was this commercial activity substantial

5 enough?  The operation of the train and the ticket sale

6 here, did it have a substantial contact with the

7 United States?

8             MR. BASOMBRIO:  There's a threestep

9 analysis, Your Honor, in Nelson.  First, you have to

10 identify the particular conduct, the actions, not the

11 causes of action, which is what the en banc court did.

12 They focused on the legal claims.

13             This Court said you have to focus on the

14 acts.  Here, the acts 

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So we did that in the

16 context of deciding when something was a sovereign act

17 as opposed to a commercial act.  We know this is a

18 commercial act.

19             So  and we  I'm just confused.  Why

20 isn't the work  why shouldn't the work be done by

21 substantial contact with the U.S.?

22             MR. BASOMBRIO:  It's a threestep analysis.

23 First, you identify the activity.  Secondly, you decide

24 whether it is commercial or not.

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Whether it's 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
8 1             MR. BASOMBRIO:  And third, whether there's 2 substantial contact. 3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   commercial or 4 sovereign. 5             MR. BASOMBRIO:  So there are three steps. 6             What I'm saying is that the Ninth Circuit 7 erred.  They didn't look at the conduct first.  They 8 looked at the legal claims.  If you look at the  9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even if they had looked 10 at the conduct, it's commercial. 11             MR. BASOMBRIO:  It's commercial.  But if you 12 look at the conduct and you identify it as the accident 13 in Austria  which is what the plaintiff claimed.  In 14 JA 15, paragraphs 3 to 8, they alleged that there was an 15 unsafe boarding platform, a gap at the platform, 16 et cetera, et cetera. 17             All of these things happened in Austria  18             JUSTICE ALITO:  But how do you propose  19 how do you propose that we determine whether it's based 20 on commercial activity? 21             Take their failuretowarn claim.  Why isn't 22 that based on something that occurred in the 23 United States?  You're just  are you just asking us 24 to  to step back and say, well, in that case we  we 25 really think they're just trying  they have a  they

9 1 have a tort that occurred in Austria, a negligence tort 2 that occurred in Austria, and they're just trying to 3 plead around it with these other claims? 4             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Well, there's no allegation 5 in the Complaint that the failure to warn was something 6 that happened in the United States.  It's found in the 7 same set of paragraphs, 3 through 8, that relate to the 8 acts and omissions in Austria. 9             It also would make no sense to argue that 10 there was a failure to warn in the United States because 11 that would mean that the Eurail Pass itself would have 12 to warn about all conditions at hundreds of potential 13 railroad stations in Europe. 14             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it might be  it 15 might be a claim that couldn't prevail, but why does 16 that answer the question? 17             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Well, the failure to warn 18 that's alleged relates to the facts that arise in 19 Austria, and, therefore, the cause of action arises in 20 Austria because that's where the acts or omissions 21 occurred if  if one looks at what's alleged in the 22 Complaint itself. 23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Would  would you agree 24 and  and, as you've been doing, take out the agency 25 question  but would you agree if  if what had

10 1 happened here was that the ticket was not honored.  You 2 know, the plaintiff bought a ticket, and the ticket was 3 not honored, and  and the suit was where the ticket 4 was purchased, would you agree that that's basedon? 5             MR. BASOMBRIO:  If this was a breach of 6 contract case  7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Just a breach of contract 8 case. 9             MR. BASOMBRIO:   and the breach  the 10 allegation of the breach was that when the Respondent 11 showed up they did not honor the ticket, that would be 12 based upon an activity in Austria because it's in 13 Austria that that ticket got honored. 14             JUSTICE KAGAN:  In Austria, even though she 15 bought the ticket in the United States?  You think even 16 the breach of contract case could not be brought in the 17 United States? 18             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Correct, because the  the 19 wrongful act, the breach, arises in Austria. 20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about  21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose we disagree 22 with that  23             MR. BASOMBRIO:  I'm sorry? 24             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose we disagree with 25 that answer?  Do you lose the case?

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose we disagree with

3 the answer that you gave to Justice Kagan.  Suppose we

4 disagree that that suit has to be in Austria.  Can you

5 still prevail on the facts of this case?

6             The hypothetical was the ticket is not

7 honored.  Suppose we disagree with your answer.  Can you

8 still prevail on the facts that it  that it did, in

9 fact, occur in this case?

10             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Yes, but I would still

11 prevail based on the agency argument that we have

12 presented.

13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  On what 

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you 

15             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could you go back and

16 explain to me what  I'm sorry.

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You  you'd lose on  on

18 the other point.

19             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Well 

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You  you acknowledge that

21 you would lose on the other point if  if that

22 hypothetical came out the other way?

23             MR. BASOMBRIO:  No, I do not.

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh.

25             MR. BASOMBRIO:  I believe  let me clarify,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Your Honor, if I may.

12

2             My answer to Justice  Justice Kagan was

3 that I believe that a breach of contract claim for

4 dishonor of the ticket in Austria has to be brought in

5 Austria.

6             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because 

7             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Justice  because that's

8 where the breach occurred that gives rise to the cause

9 of action.

10             Justice Kennedy said to me, suppose that we

11 disagree with you, can you still win the case?  And my

12 answer was, I could still win, I believe, under the

13 agency alternative argument.

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But not 

15             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about apart 

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:   not under  under the

17 argument you're  you're first making?

18             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Not if the Court ruled

19 against me, no.  But I believe 

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  On that  why?  Why?  I

21 mean, couldn't  couldn't you make the argument that

22 the question ought to be decided not  not by where

23 the  where the contract was breached but where the

24 contract was made?  I mean, we could hold  we could

25 hold that, and that would not affect your case.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
13 1             MR. BASOMBRIO:  That's true.  I  I do not 2 believe that a breach of contract claim under the fact 3 scenario that you provided, Your Honor, would give rise 4 to a claim in the United States because the breach 5 happened  would have happened in Austria. 6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Counsel, I want to come 7 back to Justice Kagan's speculation of  of whether 8 basedon is  is nothing more than due process. 9             It seems to me that the definition of 10 commercial activity carried on in the United States by a 11 foreign state is the due process test.  The definition 12 is, "A commercial activity carried on in the 13 United States by a foreign state means commercial 14 activity carried on by such state and having substantial 15 contact with the United States."  That sounds to me 16 like  like the due process test. 17             But what is required here is not just a 18 commercial activity carried on in the United States, it 19 has to be based on a commercial activity carried on in 20 the United States.  And it seems to me that is 21 something  something added to the  to the 22 constitutional test. 23             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Yes, Your Honor.  And that's 24 why I started my discussion by referring to this 25 holding  the holding of this Court in Nelson which has
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to look at the particular conduct.

14

2             The particular conduct at issue is not the

3 sale of the ticket, it's the acts and omissions that

4 resulted in the accident in Austria.

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What  what if

6 there are acts or omissions in two  let's say you have

7 a flight from New York to Vienna.  And in New York,

8 someone negligently sets or whatever they do with the

9 landing gear, okay?

10             So then the plane takes off, and then in

11 Vienna, because of the negligence in New York, it's a

12 rough landing, somebody gets a concussion.

13             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Uhhuh.

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where is the

15 gravamen of the action in that case?  Can you bring that

16 in  in the United States?

17             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Potentially, you could bring

18 it in the United States.  And the difference between

19 your scenario and this case is that in that scenario,

20 the service was provided, started in  starting in the

21 United States.  There's contact with the United States

22 because the foreign airline came here and conducted a

23 commercial activity in the United States.

24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because it's 

25             MR. BASOMBRIO:  That's what different

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
15 1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   a typical tort.  If 2 the negligence occurs in one place, and the impact is 3 the other, you could bring the suit in either place, as 4 far as our notions of personal jurisdictions, either 5 injury in the state or conduct in the state causing 6 injury outside it.  Those are typical longarm bases of 7 jurisdictions. 8             So the Chief's hypothetical where the 9 negligence occurred in the United States, that you agree 10 would be a case that could be brought in the 11 United States because the relevant conduct occurred 12 there. 13             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Correct, in that case  14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, correct.  I 15 don't understand, then, what gravamen means in the 16 Nelson decision.  Gravamen means one place, right? 17             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Right. 18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Or do you think you 19 could have a lot of different  I mean, if it's the 20 gravamen of your complaint, I think you have to choose, 21 don't you, one or the other? 22             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Well, I would  I was  I 23 would understand your example, Chief Justice, to mean 24 that the act that caused the injury was whatever they 25 didn't do upon takeoff to the plane, or  or  as I
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
16 1 understood your example, that cause of that injury was 2 in the United States. 3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So can you have more 4 than one place under the basedupon analysis in Nelson, 5 or has you  have you got to decide there's only one 6 place where you could bring the action? 7             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Well, the airline example  8 and this is something I thought about.  It's somewhat a 9 complicated example because we have conventions, 10 international treaties that deal with  with airline 11 cases. 12             I would imagine that, theoretically, there 13 could be one more  more than one location, but not on 14 the facts of this case. 15             JUSTICE ALITO:  In the Chief Justice's 16 example, he  he stated that there was negligence in 17 the United States.  But what if there's no evidence of 18 that? 19             There's a  there's a problem with the 20 landing gear when the plane lands in Austria, and the 21 claim is that there was a failure to inspect in the 22 United States, or a failure to do proper maintenance in 23 the United States.  Would that be different? 24             MR. BASOMBRIO:  That may be different. 25 Again, because the transportation was provided from the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
17 1 United States geographically, there  there is no doubt 2 in that question that commercial act was carried on in 3 the United States by the airline.  And that's different 4 here. 5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suppose it's  it's  6 it's proper to say that where you have negligence that 7 causes an injury, the  the complaint is based on both. 8 You  you don't have liability without the negligence. 9 You don't have liability without the injury.  So why 10 can't you say basedon, in  in that situation, would 11 enable either one to  to sustain the cause of action? 12             MR. BASOMBRIO:  In the airplane example, 13 perhaps either jurisdiction.  In this example, if you 14 look at the Complaint  and we're guided by the 15 allegations of the Complaint, it is  the acts are only 16 alleged to have happened and the omissions to have 17 happened  18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Getting back to our 19 earlier discussion, questions from me and from Justice 20 Kagan, it seemed to me you have to say the due process 21 analysis is insufficient under this statute because  22 then fill in the blank.  And Justice Scalia was asking 23 you the same question. 24             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Yeah. 25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  One  one answer might be
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 because otherwise there would be no necessity for a

18

2 statute.  Due process applies anyway.  But the

3 counterargument is, well, there has to be because the

4 statute makes the distinction between sovereign and

5 commercial and so it has a real purpose.

6             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Right.  The due process

7 analysis is incorporated into the statute, but it's not

8 the only thing to think about.  For example 

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You did answer, I

10 think  you did answer, rendering Justice Kennedy's

11 question somewhat academic, that there would be no

12 specific jurisdiction in the United States if all that

13 happened here was a ticket purchase from an agent where

14 the injurious conduct occurred abroad and the railroad

15 operates solely abroad.

16             You answered that whether it were the due

17 process specific jurisdiction inquiry or the Foreign

18 Sovereign Immunities Act, the answer would be the same,

19 that the ticket sale in the United States was not

20 enough.

21             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Yes, Your Honor.

22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But, of course, my

23 question was suppose that the due process analysis is

24 sufficient to sustain jurisdiction.  Then what?  Then

25 does basedon still have a separate meaning as a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
19 1 separate requirement that has to be met and has not been 2 met here?  And if so, why? 3             MR. BASOMBRIO:  It has not been met here 4 because from a general jurisdictional perspective  5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But not general 6 jurisdiction. 7             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Right. 8             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I was really talking about 9 specific jurisdiction. 10             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Okay. 11             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And, of course, Justice 12 Scalia is absolutely right with respect to general 13 jurisdiction, that all you look at is the contacts.  But 14 with respect to specific jurisdiction  this is a 15 company that doesn't have pervasive contacts  16             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Right. 17             JUSTICE KAGAN:   it's critical to the due 18 process analysis that there be a relationship, and a 19 real relationship between the particular contact with 20 the United States and the lawsuit in the exact same way 21 that this statute focuses on. 22             And so, again, I don't know if it hurts you. 23 It might be, as Justice Ginsburg says, that there 24 wouldn't be specific jurisdiction here for a 25 corporation.  But  but  but why shouldn't we treat
Alderson Reporting Company

1 those two things exactly the same way?

20

2             MR. BASOMBRIO:  There is  there is  if I

3 may answer that two parts of your question.  First,

4 there is no specific jurisdiction if OBB were a private

5 entity because the Respondent is not suing for breach of

6 the ticket; it's not alleging that it was not honored.

7 She's suing for something that happened in Austria.  The

8 specific acts happened outside the United States.

9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  Well, that's an answer

10 for why there is no specific jurisdiction here.

11             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Right.

12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And you can make the exact

13 same answer in the completely private context.  And

14 you 

15             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Right.

16             JUSTICE KAGAN:  could well be right.  I'm

17 want to ask Mr. Fisher about that.

18             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Right.

19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it's not an answer for

20 why the tests should be different.

21             MR. BASOMBRIO:  The test  the test  my

22 belief is that the test should incorporate due process

23 analysis.  But because we are also dealing with subject

24 matter jurisdiction, which is a different analysis than

25 personal jurisdiction, there are other policy

Alderson Reporting Company

1 considerations.

Official

21

2             The policy considerations decisions that

3 Congress made were based on territory.  If one want 

4 if one looks at the first, the second, and the third

5 clause, they're all territorybased distinctions.  In 

6 in the case Amerada Hess, this Court held that tort

7 actions are meant to be encompassed by the second

8 section of the  of the exception, the non 

9 noncommercial torts exception.  That requires that the

10 tort happened in the United States in order to be  to

11 have subject matter on personal jurisdiction.  It

12 wouldn't fit here.

13             Justice Ginsburg referred to direct effects.

14 That would come under the third clause, which deals with

15 commercial activity outside of the U.S.; again, a

16 territorial line, having an effect here.

17             The first clause draws the territorial line

18 here and says that commercial activity has to happen in

19 this side of the line within the United States.  And

20 that's what we don't have here.

21             I would like to 

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What provision are you 

23 what provision are you referring to?

24             MR. BASOMBRIO:  I'm pro  referring to the

25 first clause of the commercial activity exception, that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 it requires that the commercial activity be conducted, 2 carried out in the United States.  That means that 3 within the territory of the United States.  And I 4 reached that conclusion by comparing it to the third 5 clause, which refers to commercial activity outside of 6 the United States having a direct effect in the 7 United States, Your Honor. 8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I see. 9             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Now if I may just say one 10 point about agency.  There is no dispute here that if 11 the definition in the Act applies, RP doesn't fit within 12 it. 13             Now, this Court has recently held that we 14 are guided by the language of the statute.  I understand 15 that arguments have been made by my colleagues and also 16 by the Ninth Circuit that there is a difference between 17 invocation of immunity and attribution.  This is the 18 point I want to make.  Section 1604 is the invocation 19 section.  That's the section that states that certain 20 people, those defined as the foreign state, can invoke 21 immunity. 22             Section 1605 is an attribution section.  It 23 says whose acts deprive you of immunity.  And because 24 foreign state is a defined term, we are limited to the 25 limitations in the FSIA.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
23 1             In the alternative, if this Court were to 2 move away from the definition, I believe we would all 3 agree that there has to be some element of control.  The 4 test that this Court develops for agent has to have 5 either the degree of control in Bancec or something 6 lesser.  But all agency law requires control, and that's 7 where the en banc court missed the mark.  They didn't 8 require any control.  And if one requires control, it 9 has to be reversed because there was no control here. 10             If there are no pending questions, I would 11 appreciate reserving the balance of my time for 12 rebuttal. 13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 14             Mr. Kneedler. 15            ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 16    ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 17                   SUPPORTING REVERSAL 18             MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 19 please the Court: 20             I'd like to start with the point about 21 whether the FSIA simply incorporates due process 22 standards, and we think it does not.  It contains its 23 own statutory terms which require interpretation. 24 Congress did not simply incorporate the D.C. LongArm 25 Statute or due process principles or phrase the  the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 statute in that way.  It enacted specific statutory

24

2 terms.  And it's 

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So is it the basedupon

4 language or the substantialcontext language?

5             MR. KNEEDLER:  It's both.  It's both and in

6 the  in the United States, which is an important point

7 I want to make.  The  one of the reasons it's very

8 different from just due process is because this  the

9 FSIA governs subject matter jurisdiction and personal

10 jurisdiction to be sure, but based  based upon a

11 determination of immunity of a foreign state.  And it

12 does that by drawing, as was mentioned before, a strict

13 territorial line that runs throughout all the

14 exceptions.  For example, the intentional  the tort

15 exception applies only to torts in the United States.

16 And the property exception concerns property in the

17 United States.  And the focus of the commercial activity

18 exception is also, at least under clause one  well,

19 all of them  but clause one is commercial activity in

20 the United States that also has a substantial

21 connection, but the action has to be based upon, as

22 Justice Scalia pointed out.

23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but how is basedupon

24 different from the language we routinely use in specific

25 jurisdiction cases?  In other words, it just seems as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
25 1 though Congress, in line with its objective of treating 2 foreign government engaging in commercial activity in 3 the same way as they would be treated in the foreign 4 corporations case, in line with that objective, used 5 language that's virtually synonymous with the language 6 that we use in specific jurisdiction cases. 7             MR. KNEEDLER:  But  but it  it did it in 8 the context of a statutory structure that is designed to 9 protect foreign sovereign immunity and not to draw U.S. 10 courts into what could be very sensitive international 11 questions of having U.S. courts pass judgment on what 12 happens in a foreign country.  For example  13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, except it did so in 14 the context of distinguishing between commercial 15 activity and sovereign activity. 16             MR. KNEEDLER:  In  in Nelson  actually, 17 the pertinent paragraph in Nelson that discusses 18 basedupon, as counsel pointed out, the Court said you 19 start with what is the conduct that  that the suit is 20 based upon.  And the Court said the conduct there was 21 the conduct that took place in Saudi Arabia.  And then 22 it had a discussion that said, to be sure, there was 23 recruitment that  that preceded that, and that 24 recruitment put the employee in the position to be in 25 the hospital in Saudi Arabia where the conduct occurred.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             But the focus was on, as the Court said,

26

2 those torts in Saudi Arabia, not the  not the

3 antecedent commercial activity in the United States.

4 That discussion in the Court's opinion preceded its

5 discussion of the distinction between commercial

6 activity and  and sovereign activity.  It had to do

7 what  with what is the focus of the claim.  And there

8 the Court was focusing on tort claims that happened

9 outside the United States.  And we think it's very

10 important in this case to distinguish between tort

11 claims and contract claims.

12             JUSTICE ALITO:  What if you have a tort

13 claim that has one element in the United States?  How

14 do  how does a court determine whether the gravamen of

15 the claim is in the United States or elsewhere?

16             MR. KNEEDLER:  I think  I think focusing

17 on what  on what the defendant's conduct is that

18 actually caused the injury.  And here, the  the only

19 difference between this case and Nelson is the argument

20 that the purchase of the ticket, which is the  by the

21 way, the only commercial activity that was relied upon

22 below.  The Ninth Circuit says this at Phaneuf 13 and

23 Footnote 4.  Respondent is now trying to broaden that

24 into the entire operations of the railroad which would

25 actually be an assertion of general jurisdiction.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
27 1 Anything that would arise in the operation of a railroad 2 in  in Austria could be the subject of a suit if it 3 was deemed to have substantial connection with the 4 United States. 5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If we want to give 6 basedupon a separate substantive effect in this statute 7 and so that it means something more substantial than 8 mere due  than what would suffice for due process, 9 what  what body of law, case law do we look to? 10             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I think in Nelson  11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If I want to find out 12 about basedon, what kind of cases am I supposed to 13 read? 14             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well  well  and Nelson 15 itself, I think, is very instructive on this because, 16 first of all, the Court in Nelson did not  did not 17 describe what it was doing as simply applying due 18 process standards.  It was applying the statutory terms. 19 And it  again, it  it focused on the particular 20 conduct  and this goes to Justice Alito's question as 21 well  it focused on the conduct that really caused the 22 injury, which in that case was the  were the 23 intentional torts  24             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So Mr.  25             MR.

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  In  in my contract hypo,

3 if the  if the suit was a breach of contract action,

4 do you think it would be basedupon?  Just a straight,

5 like, you don't  you didn't honor my ticket?

6             MR. KNEEDLER:  On  on a contract claim, I

7 think that there well  may well be a contract claim

8 here.  But I think it's important to recognize that a

9 breach of contract claim, just because there is some

10 connection with the United States, does not

11 automatically  even for due process purposes, some

12 connection of a contract to the forum is not enough.

13 The Court made that point in Burger King about contracts

14 which was discussed in the  in the Court's Walden v.

15 Fiore case.

16             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Kneedler, before

17 you  before you finish, you bring up an interest in

18 relations with other nations.

19             Do you know  I mean, there are other

20 nations that have similar legislation to the Foreign

21 Sovereign Immunities Act.  Do we know how this case

22 would come out, say, in Canada, Germany, or France under

23 similar legislation?

24             MR. KNEEDLER:  The European Convention

25 provides for jurisdiction over tort claims, which

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 this  which this basically is, only with respect to 2 torts that arise in the territory, which is  which is 3 the case here in our own tort exception, which is an 4 important  going back to Justice Kagan's question  5 an important reason why this is different from due 6 process. 7             Tort claims under the FSIA, under  under 8 Exemption (5), Paragraph (a)(5), arise only when the 9 tort occurs in the United States.  And even business 10 torts  the House Report refers to business torts in 11 the United States because there was a  Congress was 12 drawing a territorial line.  And we  13             JUSTICE BREYER:  The Netherlands  the 14 Netherlands and Switzerland have filed a brief, haven't 15 they, in which they said that this injury, the claim 16 that's pursued against here, the facts that underlie it, 17 are based upon activity that took place in Switzerland. 18             MR. KNEEDLER:  Right. 19             JUSTICE BREYER:  In Austria. 20             MR. KNEEDLER:  Right. 21             JUSTICE BREYER:  And so they wouldn't  22             MR.

2             MR. KNEEDLER:  I  as far as  

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  They've put lawyers on both

4 sides, and I'm sure one of the lawyers would have told

5 us if they'd found a country that would have reached 

6             MR. KNEEDLER:  And this 

7             JUSTICE BREYER:   result.

8             MR. KNEEDLER:  The same general point is

9 true in the UN convention on  on immunity with respect

10 to tort claims 

11             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Kneedler, how about 

12 there is a contract claim in this lawsuit, so there is

13 a  is a kind of warranty of fitness kind of claim.

14 How  how about that?  Why  if you think that the 

15 let's assume that the contract claim, which is like you

16 didn't honor my ticket, that there would be personal

17 jurisdiction over, how do we separate out the warranty

18 of habitability or fitness claim?

19             MR. KNEEDLER:  Because I think  I think

20 that's very parallel to what this Court confronted in

21 the Nelson case where the  the Court said the failure

22 to warn  there was a claim there too, a failure to

23 warn about the hazard  about the potential tort.  And

24 the  and the court said, it  it would not recognize

25 jurisdiction by that sort of feint of language.  You

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
31 1 can't recharacterize something that is basically a tort 2 abroad by claiming that there was a failure to warn  3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is  is that a typical 4 thing  5             MR. KNEEDLER:  about the tort.  We think 6 that's true here. 7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that a typical thing or 8 an unusual thing to do in jurisdiction cases?  In other 9 words, to say, we're just not going to look at this 10 claim by claim, we're going to ask about the whole gist 11 of the lawsuit. 12             MR. KNEEDLER:  We think that, at least for 13 tort claims, that, again, under our  our position you 14 look at the foundation of the claim, the gravamen of the 15 claim.  And applying that principle to tort claims, 16 anyway, it's proper to look about where  where the 17 conduct occurred, the tortious  the injurycausing 18 conduct occurred rather than the injury itself? 19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can the gravamen be in more 20 than one place? 21             MR. KNEEDLER:  Pardon me? 22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is  the basedupon 23 language, does it identify a single place, or could it 24 be basedupon activity in  in two jurisdictions? 25             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it  it could be

2 jurisdictions.  The House Report describing this talks

3 about commercial activities occurring in whole or in

4 part in the United States.

5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But not in the airline

6 case.  You would not say that the airline case, the

7 gravamen was the negligence in the United States and the

8 injury when the plane landed?

9             MR. KNEEDLER:  I think, depending on where

10 the tort occurred, it may  it may just be in the place

11 where the  where the negligence occurred.

12             But I do want to say that for airlines 

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It can't be both?

14             MR. KNEEDLER:  Oh, it could be  it could

15 be because the question under the FSIA is whether you

16 can sue in the United States.  Whether you can sue

17 abroad is not determined by basedupon language in

18 the  in the FSIA.

19             But the  with respect to airlines,

2            ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

3               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4             MR. FISHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

5 please the Court:

6             I'd like to start with Justice Sotomayor's

7 question which I think has been asked a couple of other

8 times today, which is, what would the answer be if this

9 were a private defendant?  And in footnote 11 of our

10 brief on page 33, we explain why the answer would be

11 that there would be specific jurisdiction.

12             And in the GibsonDunn amicus brief at pages

13 25 to 29 they give a fuller explanation.  No response 

14             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why  why, Mr. Fisher?

15 There is one contact with the United States.  A pass is

16 bought from a travel agent in Massachusetts, a pass

17 covering 30odd railroads.  That's all that happened in

18 the United States.  All of the relevant conduct, the

19 tortious conduct occurred abroad.

20             I don't know of a single case where we have

21 said specific jurisdiction can be based on a connection

22 that had nothing to do with the injurious conduct.

23             MR. FISHER:  But, Justice Ginsburg, I think

24 there are plenty of cases that support the proposition

25 that when a company markets and sells a product in a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 jurisdiction, that creates specific jurisdiction.

35

2 That's what OBB did through its agent, RPE, is market

3 and sell its product.

4             JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but not for everything.

5 I mean, let's assume this.  Let's assume that I get a

6 brochure from the Vienna Opera Company, and I send back

7 the order form, I'd like to buy tickets, okay?  Now, for

8 sure, if the Vienna Opera Company refused to honor my

9 tickets, I have a claim, and it arises out of the fact

10 that they have marketed my tickets in the United States.

11             But now they honor my tickets, and I go up

12 the stairs, and I slip in a puddle, and I injure myself.

13 What does that have to do with the only contact that

14 they've in the United States?  I mean, at that point,

15 you're just saying it's a butfor test, and everything

16 would be included.  But I don't know of a sensible

17 specific jurisdiction analysis that would  that would

18 run like that.

19             MR. FISHER:  I agree with everything you

20 said.  But this case is different because our lawsuit is

21 based on the duty of safe passage that gave rise in that

22 sale  in that ticket sale.  So we're suing based on

23 the promise and the offer 

24             JUSTICE BREYER:  In the  in the Austrian

25 case of the Opera, there is an implied warranty that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
36 1 Opera is fit for the purposes  the opera house is fit 2 for the purposes which it serves.  Okay?  Same thing. 3 Not too hard to draft that. 4             MR. FISHER:  I'm not sure.  And if somebody 5 did draft that, it would certainly be subject to a 6 12(b)(6)  7             JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the difference 8 between saying that they have to warrant their product, 9 which is an opera house, to be safe, to say that they 10 have to warrant their trains safe for  for passage?  I 11 can't see a difference.  And it seems to me it's very 12 normal in a contract to say that the seller of the 13 product is implicitly warranting fitness.  Isn't it? 14             MR. FISHER:  Well, all I can say is in this 15 case, we're suing on the exact warranty that gives rise 16 from this ticket sale, Justice Breyer.  And I think  17             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's  that's the 18 problem.  I take it to go back to the questions you were 19 asked, from your answer, you have found no case in any 20 country where a waiver of sovereign immunity based on 21 commercial activity supports you.  And if so, what is 22 that case?  Switzerland and Britain  or rather, 23 Netherlands, say no.  The EU Treaty says no.  The 24 UN Charter says no.  And they have all these lists of 25 language which, while not absolutely against you, leans

1 against you.

2             So I want to know what is there, in the law

3 of sovereign immunity particularly, that argue  leans

4 in your favor.

5             MR. FISHER:  So, Justice Breyer, to  let

6 me be clear about what is and is not in that brief.

7 There are no cases that I don't think any party has

8 cited.  What the  what that brief says is that based

9 on the language in various conventions, that this claim

10 wouldn't be able to be brought somewhere else.  But the

11 language in those conventions are things like arise

12 under, based upon, and so you basically end up in the

13 same situation as you are here which is having to decide

14 whether this claim can be brought.

15             Remember that brief also alleges and it

16 actually spends more time alleging that there is no

17 proper principleagent relationship, which I think is 

18 the Court has probably realized is not a very credible

19 argument.  So I think you should be careful about

20 putting too much weight on a brief that simply cites

21 some treaty language.

22             But I think the point I want to make, and

23 this  for the hypotheticals and to bring it back to my

24 case, and I also tie in the contract 

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  But I'm taking your

38

2             MR. FISHER:  We have none, and they have

3 none.  I have not found 

4             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Okay.  All

5 right.

6             MR. FISHER:  You can ask him on rebuttal.

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me, your

8 adversary claims you've been trying to change what your

9 claim is.  Is it based on the ticket sale?  Or is it

10 based on the operation of the train?

11             MR. FISHER:  I think the better reading of

12 the word "activity" in the statute for the reasons we

13 describe in our brief is the overall integrated activity

14 of running the railway train enterprise, which includes

15 selling the product and delivering the product.

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  I see our interests, but

17 I'm thinking there are 190someodd countries in the

18 world.  Many of them do have governments that run

19 various kinds of enterprises.  When they come to the

20 United States, perhaps not being totally conversant with

21 American law, they might think if my commercial activity

22 in the United States really gives rise to some problem

23 in the United States, I expect to be sued.  But where

24 what really gives rise to it  you see, I have to use

25 language like that  takes place in my country, I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 expect it will be my courts that will deal with it.

39

2             MR. FISHER:  Well, I don't know why any

3 country would have thought that about this country's

4 law, because before this  you know, up until this

5 point, the law in the lower courts, the D.C. Circuit and

6 the Second Circuit, and most  most specifically, have

7 held that in this exact situation, there is

8 jurisdiction.

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, maybe 

10             MR. FISHER:  And Justice Breyer 

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   they would've

12 read  if they had read our opinion in Nelson, that

13 would have given them a good inclination to read

14 sovereign immunity the way Justice Breyer suggests.

15             MR. FISHER:  No.  I'm glad you asked about

16 Nelson, Mr. Chief Justice, because the paragraph in

17 Nelson that Mr. Kneedler is referring to is

18 distinguishing sovereign activity from commercial

19 activity.  The Court in Nelson did not have before it

20 and was not concerned with the geographic nexus, and you

21 know that because in that paragraph where it lists the

22 things upon which the Nelsons' claim is not truly based,

23 it lists not only the recruitment in the United States

24 but the actual employment in Saudi Arabia.

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, he has a paragraph in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
40 1 Nelson, one sentence of which helps you, that he says 2 the Nelsons  you know, they negotiated with the 3 Nelsons in the United States.  They entered into a 4 contract in the United States.  The Nelsons are heard 5 aborad.  I take it that's the basis of it, and this 6 helps you. 7             But he says before even taking each of the 8 Nelsons' allegations about the recruitment and 9 employment is true, those facts entitle the Nelsons to 10 nothing under their theory of the case, which isn't 11 contract.  But, he goes on to say, it's these torts, 12 which happened in the hospital abroad and not the 13 arguably commercial activities that preceded their 14 commission that formed the basis for the Nelsons' suit. 15             MR. FISHER:  So  16             JUSTICE BREYER:  The basis for.  You see. 17 And so  18             MR. FISHER:  Justice Breyer  19             JUSTICE BREYER:   that's why I'm thinking 20 it does not help you. 21             MR. FISHER:  When the Court said the 22 arguable commercial activities that preceded it, they 23 were talking not only about the recruitment in the 24 United States but also the employment itself in Saudi 25 Arabia.  And they were distinguishing that from the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
41 1 police activity of seizing somebody and holding him in 2 jail, which was what the case was really about which 3 were sovereign activities. 4             So the Court in Nelson  Mr. Chief Justice, 5 to be clear, I'm not saying Nelson supports me.  I think 6 Nelson simply doesn't answer this question because you 7 were concerned in that case with sovereign versus 8 commercial, not geographic nexus. 9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So in line with the 10 discussion we had earlier about specific jurisdiction, 11 is your argument that general jurisdiction is enough to 12 support basedupon under the statute? 13             MR. FISHER:  No, Your Honor.  I  14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought you 15 talked about just all of the different commercial 16 activities that the Austrian airline engaged in in the 17 United States.  And if it's all of the different 18 commercial activities, that sounds like general 19 jurisdiction, not the specific jurisdiction. 20             MR. FISHER:  No.  I think OBB is subject to 21 jurisdiction under the  or  I'm sorry, I should say 22 does not have sovereign immunity under the FSIA for its 23 train operation of selling tickets and getting people 24 rides on the trains.  It wouldn't be subject to 25 jurisdiction if it had some  if it had a mining

2 even touch the United States.

3             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose 

4             MR. FISHER:  So the activity 

5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  But in point of fact,

6 that's all OBB does.  So, effectively, your argument is

7 an argument that OBB is subject to jurisdiction in a

8 general jurisdiction kind of way with respect to

9 everything that they do.  And, you know, I think what

10 the Chief Justice is suggesting is, like, that seems

11 wrong.

12             MR. FISHER:  Well, let me say two things,

13 Justice Kagan.

14             (Laughter.)

15             MR. FISHER:  Thank you.  I think that is the

16 fairest reading of the statute, and Mr. Kneedler was

17 talking about the House Report.  One of the examples in

18 the House Report of a commercial activity was running an

19 airline.  It's hard to distinguish running an airline

20 from running a train system.

21             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose 

22             MR. FISHER:  So the terms of the statue do

23 cover that.

24             If  Justice Alito, may I  may I just say

25 one more thing to Justice Kagan?

Alderson Reporting Company

43 1             JUSTICE ALITO:  Sure.  Finish your answer. 2             MR. FISHER:  Which is if you didn't agree 3 that the term "commercial activity" covered the entire 4 enterprise, then you would ask the question whether the 5 activity of selling tickets is enough to create a 6 basedupon argument in a specific jurisdiction since we 7 went back to the conversation we've been having. 8             JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose Ms. Sachs was 9 Australian, and she bought this ticket on the Internet 10 in Australia.  Would you say that there would be no 11 sovereign immunity in the suit in the United States? 12             MR. FISHER:  Well, there wouldn't 13 necessarily be sovereign  there may not be sovereign 14 immunity under the terms of the Act.  But obviously, 15 there would be a number of reasons why that case 16 couldn't be brought  17             JUSTICE ALITO:  But there would be  there 18 would be  there would not be immunity because it was 19 based on the running of the railroad. 20             MR. FISHER:  Right.  Which  which  on 21 the  taking everything else the same, has substantial 22 contact to the United States.  But all the  all we're 23 talking about in this case is immunity.  Section 1330, 24 where it has jurisdiction over foreign states, 25 has  says that that jurisdiction has to be in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
44 1 personam.  And obviously, that would carry with it the 2 requirements for in personam jurisdiction which would 3 require a contact in this country. 4             And this is one thing I want to make sure, 5 is the Court understands to bring us back to the 6 hypotheticals we were talking about earlier and to tie 7 in the contract hypothetical, it's important for the 8 Court to understand there are all manner of cases where 9 a duty is created in this country by way of a foreign 10 state's commercial activities, and then injuries or 11 breaches occur a broad.  In fact, this is rather the 12 oddball case. 13             The more typical case is a highfinance deal 14 like the bonds case in the Weltover case, other kinds of 15 international finance and loans.  There are many 16 employment cases where United States citizens sign an 17 employment contract or are lured abroad, study abroad 18 programs in the educational sphere, all kinds of 19 situations where a duty is created in this country, but 20 then all of the events that the lawsuit turns out to be 21 about happen abroad. 22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, if  23             MR. FISHER:  If that's the case  24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Fisher, you  you 25 recognize  I think you recognized in your brief that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 this  you can call it a question of first impression. 2 You  you said, I believe, based on  the meaning of 3 basedon in this context is an open question. 4             And if it is an open question, why should we 5 allow a foreign carrier to be sued in the United States 6 for acts or omissions overseas  the negligent conduct 7 occurred overseas  when the only link, the single link 8 is a ticket, a pass, purchased from a  a travel agent 9 in the United States? 10             MR. FISHER:  For all the reasons I was just 11 saying, Justice Ginsburg, because it is utterly common 12 for duties to be created in this country  here, the 13 duty of safe passage and of utmost care  and then the 14 breach to occur a broad. 15             My  my friend on the other side was 16 correct to say this case is indistinguishable from 17 contract cases.  There are  there are all kinds of 18 cases where duties are created in this country and then 19 breached abroad. 20             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if that's true  21             MR. FISHER:  The lower courts have always 22 held that the FSIA  23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  If that's true, I don't 24 understand why you answered my hypothetical question the 25 way you did, because in my hypothetical question I
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1 thought you said that there would not be jurisdiction to 2 sue in the United States when I slip and fall in Vienna. 3             And  but you could make the same argument. 4 Well, there was a duty created in the United States, and 5 that's what I'm suing on. 6             MR. FISHER:  I think when I answered your 7 question I was imagining there wasn't a duty created. 8 Maybe as Justice Breyer amended the hypothetical, there 9 might be  10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, there's  I mean, the 11 only thing that's happened in the United States is that 12 I've purchased a ticket there.  That's  that's what 13 I've done. 14             MR. FISHER:  Right. 15             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So I take it that your 16 argument is that purchase of a ticket gives rise to a 17 duty which is then violated when I slip and fall in 18 another country. 19             MR. FISHER:  I would say if the plaintiff 20 alleges that in the lawsuit, then there would not be 21 sovereign immunity.  And then Justice Alito's  I think 22 as he was saying earlier, you would have a  perhaps a 23 very strong 12(b)(6) argument that there's no such State 24 law claim that actually gave rise in that context. 25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If  if you get on
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
47 1 the train in Vienna, and you buy your ticket in Vienna 2 and you get on the train in Vienna, there is on the 3 train operator some duty of care, isn't there? 4             Without regard to  in other words, there's 5 nothing special about buying a ticket in the 6 United States that gives rise to a unique duty of care 7 that's any different from the duty of care that the 8 railroad owes its passengers in Austria. 9             MR. FISHER:  I think that's right, Mr. Chief 10 Justice, but  as long as you're talking about buying a 11 ticket one place to the other.  But of course that's 12 true of any seller of any product that they  that they 13 stand  you know, they offer the same thing depending 14 on where you buy it. 15             But the critical thing is where did they 16 sell their ticket?  They reached out to this country  17 and it is worth answering your question with this 18 important point, which is the product that they sold to 19 Ms. Sachs is not available to Austrian citizens.  This 20 is a speciallytailored product available only  21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand.  But 22 there's nothing unique about the standard of care based 23 upon whether it's a Eurail Pass or something else, is 24 there? 25             I'm just trying to suggest that you're
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
48 1 putting an awful lot of weight on the standard of care 2 created by the purchase of the ticket.  And  and 3 that's no different here or whether the ticket was 4 purchased in  in Austria. 5             MR. FISHER:  It would  6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It makes no 7 difference to what standard of care she would allege if 8 there were some other basis for jurisdiction in the 9 United States? 10             MR. FISHER:  That might be correct, but it 11 is important not to lose sight of the fact that she 12 didn't buy her ticket there.  OBB reached out into this 13 forum. 14             And just going back to this Court's ordinary 15 due process cases, when a business purposefully avails 16 itself of the protections and the opportunities of a 17 particular jurisdiction  18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Fisher, the 19 purposefullyavailedof test relates to specific 20 jurisdiction, and there has to be an instant connecting. 21 If there is that connection, then you must have, in 22 addition, purposefullyavailedof. 23             But purposefullyavailedof, standing alone, 24 doesn't give you general jurisdiction, and it doesn't 25 give you specific jurisdiction.
Alderson Reporting Company

49 1             MR. FISHER:  No.  Fair enough.  But you have 2 to have a contact, and that's the substantial contact 3 test in this  in this case  4             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you also have to have a 5 relationship. 6             MR. FISHER:  And you have to have a 7 relationship, which we do, because we purchased it here. 8             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, let's say that I don't 9 accept that argument, okay?  Let's just for a moment 10 assume that on a straight negligence claim, the idea 11 that a negligence claim arising from an accident in 12 Austria arises  let's say I think it arises from the 13 accident in Austria.  It does not arise from the 14 purchase of a ticket in the United States, okay? 15             MR. FISHER:  Yeah. 16             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now, I guess there's still a 17 question as to whether your warranty claims ought to be 18 treated differently.  And I take it what Mr. Kneedler 19 has said about that is, no, they shouldn't be, that's 20 just fancy pleading, it's just a way of converting a 21 negligence claim into a contract claim.  It's the same 22 kind of thing that happened in Nelson that we refused to 23 allow.  Why isn't that right? 24             MR. FISHER:  It's not right because what you 25 were worried about in Nelson is artful pleading to get
Alderson Reporting Company

1 around true sovereign immunity; in other words, to

50

2 challenge sovereign acts dressed up as something else.

3             Here there's no allegation that we're

4 challenging sovereign acts.  Everybody agrees we're

5 challenging commercial acts.  There's only the

6 geographic nexus question.  So we can plead a tort

7 however we like subject to Rule 12(b)(6), which they can

8 make on remand.

9             And, Mr. Chief Justice, maybe I could turn

10 back to one of yours questions, because I think it

11 further highlights the difficulty with the other side's

12 test.

13             It has to be enough for a duty to create a

14 cause of action, we say, because otherwise you're left

15 with this gravamen test.  And either  gravamen test

16 has to mean one of two things:  Either it has to mean

17 that only one particular place can be the gravamen,

18 which is the way I understood it from their briefing.

19 But as the Court, I think, is figuring out from this

20 argument, you get into all heaps of troubles with

21 contracts, employment, all kinds of other things where

22 the injuries occur abroad, and how on earth is the Court

23 to determine where the gravamen is.

24             On the other hand, if gravamen is sort of a

25 gravaperson's test so that you can have many multiple

They move  well, how 11 does it happen? 12             MR.

9 whether it's the one or the other?

21 different legal circumstances, and courts have to decide

22 what is the gravamen, and sometimes that's difficult and

You're the one  I'm not very 6 knowledgeable, and I  I tend to believe you're more 7 knowledgeable.  Therefore, I'm asking you the question. 8             MR.

FISHER:  I will add that  13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If we're dealing with 14 choice of law, is  is there any serious question of 15 what law would govern the adequacy of OBB's boarding 16 protocol, or their platform design?  Would that be any 17 law other than Austria? 18             MR. FISHER:  Well, the Ninth Circuit held 19 that California law applies in this case, and OBB has 20 never  has not challenged that holding.  So as the 21 case comes to this Court, California law applies for 22 purposes of the one element  23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And I'm  I'm asking 24 you.  Never mind what the California court said. 25             We have an accident in Austria, and it's
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
54 1 based on  the allegation is the boarding protocol was 2 negligently designed, or the platform, the space between 3 the train and the platform, negligently designed. 4             What law would govern whether that platform 5 was negligently designed, whether the boarding protocol, 6 operating protocol was negligent? 7             MR. FISHER:  In all candor, Justice 8 Ginsburg, there'd be a pretty good argument that Austria 9 law should apply.  And it is important for the Court to 10 understand that simply holding that a suit under the 11 FSIA can be brought in this country does not mean that 12 U.S. law applies.  There's a separate choice of law 13 analysis that can be made.  And so OBB had the 14 opportunity to make choice of law arguments and has 15 decided not to. 16             But remember, they can do choice of law 17 analysis not only in terms of ordinary common law 18 principles that might apply in a court, but there's a 19 number of ways that a defendant in OBB's position can 20 protect itself in a case like this. 21             First of all, they can put a choice of law 22 provision in the ticket, or in the contract, or whatever 23 might be at issue. 24             Second of all, even as to forum, forum 25 selection clauses can be put into tickets like this, and

55 1 contracts, and in fact they are.  As the United States 2 told the Court at the cert stage of this case, all of 3 these tickets now are governed by a forum selection 4 clause provision, so you'll never see a case like this 5 again, not only in the railroad context, but even in the 6 airline industry. 7             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that  and that 8 works, even though it's an adhesion contract, and it's 9 small print  10             MR. FISHER:  Under Carnival Cruise Lines, 11 this Court's decision, those kinds of forum selection 12 clauses are perfectly enforceable. 13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That  that was an 14 admiralty case, though. 15             MR. FISHER:  Well, I don't know why it would 16 be different in this context, Justice Kennedy. 17 Certainly the government says that these are all 18 governed by forum selection clauses now.  We think they 19 are, too. 20             So what you're really deciding in this case, 21 if I could end where perhaps I began, is you're not 22 deciding transportation in this case, because all 23 transportation cases are now covered by conventions and 24 forum selection causes.  What you're really deciding is 25 what the law should be in the mainstream FSIA cases,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
56 1 like finance, like contracts.  That's why GibsonDunn 2 has filed a case on behalf of a  of a large hedge fund 3 that says, we do business all the time with foreign 4 sovereigns and we're very worried that if the Court 5 adopts this gravamen basedupon, we will not be able to 6 enforce contracts and duties in this country that have 7 given rise under negotiations in this country and then 8 are breached abroad. 9             Employment situations, like the hypothetical 10 we give in our brief, where a United States citizen is 11 hired as an engineer to go do oil and gas exploration 12 and then something happens abroad. 13             Those cases have always been brought in this 14 country.  And if this Court adopts the gravamen test, 15 what you'll be saying is the courts now have some 16 amorphous test that would seem, especially if there is 17 only a single gravamen, that would seem to bounce all of 18 these cases out of the United States courts, which would 19 be dramatically  20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, suppose  suppose 21 the Court simply said, buying a ticket from an agent in 22 the United States is not enough, period.  We don't adopt 23 any gravamen.  The question is, what does basedon mean. 24 And the Court could say basedon is not basedon if all 25 that happened in the United States is the purchase of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the ticket.  We don't have to buy any gravamen or

57

2 anything else.

3             MR. FISHER:  Well, I think there is two

4 reasons why you couldn't just limit it to that,

5 Justice Ginsburg.  First, as a legal matter, our claim

6 depends on the duty that arose when that ticket's

7 purchase was made.  And I don't see any legal way to

8 distinguish duties that arose in a ticket sale from

9 other kinds of duties that arise and all kinds of other

10 marketing and contract settings.

11             And second of all, just as a matter of

12 common sense, remember  let's go back to where we

13 began  this is a commercial activity exception.  If

14 they weren't selling tickets, it wouldn't even be

15 commercial to begin with.  So it would be a highly odd

16 holding to say that the one thing that makes this

17 commercial is what prevents it from being brought in the

18 United States.

19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What makes it commercial

20 is it's a railroad doing the same thing a private

21 railroad would do.  It's in  its business is operating

22 a railroad.

23             MR. FISHER:  That's right, Justice Ginsburg.

24 And if you want us to ask the question in terms of

25 whether a private company would be subject to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
58 1 jurisdiction under the same settings here, at least all 2 you have to hold is that OBB should be in the same shoes 3 as a private company. 4             Now, we say in our brief and in the Gibson 5 brief in more detail, why due process wouldn't stand in 6 the way of jurisdiction there.  But if you have any 7 doubt about that, you can note that OBB has made a 8 personal jurisdiction argument in the district court 9 that the district court never reached.  And so that is 10 available on remand. 11             The only thing before this Court is 12 sovereign immunity and whether OBB is entitled to 13 sovereign immunity for commercial acts in this country 14 and the teeth of a congressional statute that says in 15 the declaration of purpose in Section 1602 that foreign 16 states doing commercial activities in this country 17 should not be entitled to sovereign immunity. 18             And then in Section 1606 says:  What we want 19 to do is  20             JUSTICE BREYER:  And we say, look, did  21 they're  your exact words. 22             MR. FISHER:  Pardon me? 23             JUSTICE BREYER:  Are they liable for 24 activity that took place in this country?  They are 25 liable for the breach of the contract.  The breach of
Alderson Reporting Company

1 the contract took place in Austria.

59

2             MR. FISHER:  No.

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  End of case.

4             MR. FISHER:  No.

5             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not?

6             MR. FISHER:  Because  because what the

7 definition of in the United States, Justice Breyer, and

8 this is sub (D) of 1603(c), says that  I'm sorry, it's

9 sub  sub (E) of 1603(c) says that "in the

10 United States" is defined as substantial contact with

11 the United States.  And so that can occur in whole or in

12 part in this country, and in part  I'm sorry, in part

13 includes the ticket sale.

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

15             Mr. Basombrio, you have three minutes

16 remaining.

17            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. BASOMBRIO

18                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Thank you, Mr. Chief

20 Justice, and may it please the Court:

21             Much of our discussion today has been in

22 separating the torts from the contractual claims here in

23 this case, implied warranty claims.  Let me tell you why

24 I believe it's a bad idea to split claims on causes of

25 action.  This Court decided recently a case called

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
60 1 Pimentel in which the Republic of the Philippines had 2 sovereign immunity.  But there were also a number of 3 other defendants that did not enjoy sovereign immunity. 4 And this Court, taking into consideration important 5 issues such as international comity, decided that under 6 Rule 19, the entire lawsuit had to be dismissed, 7 including as to nonsovereign entities, in order to give 8 full effect to the sovereign immunity of the Republic of 9 the Philippines. 10             In light of that holding, it would make 11 little sense that when the defendant has the right to 12 invoke immunity, that we would split the causes of 13 action so that some of them would proceed in Austria and 14 some of them would proceed in the United States. 15             JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you suggesting the 16 basedupon determination is not done on a claimbyclaim 17 basis, it's  you look at the entire complaint? 18             MR. BASOMBRIO:  That's why  19             JUSTICE ALITO:  You find the gravamen of the 20 entire complaint? 21             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Yes, exactly, Your Honor. 22 And the circuit courts and the State courts have all 23 understood what gravamen means.  They know what it 24 means.  And if we just took anybody off the street here 25 and we asked them, why is the Respondent suing, each
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
61 1 person would say, because she was injured in a terrible 2 accident in Austria. 3             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if the only claim 4 were the breach of warranty claim? 5             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Then we would have to ask 6 where did the breach occur.  As in Justice Kagan's 7 question, I would answer, if the breach occurred in 8 Austria, then the claim would arise in Austria. 9             Now, the warranty, in terms of the duty of 10 care, there is no duty of care until she arrives at the 11 station and tries to board that train.  And even if she 12 didn't have a ticket at all, the record establishes that 13 we would still owe her a duty of care. 14             JUSTICE ALITO:  What if she also had, in 15 addition to the claims she's asserted, a conventional 16 breach of contract claim?  She said that when they  17 when she tried to get on the train, they said no, your 18 Eurail Pass doesn't let you get on free, you have to pay 19 an additional amount? 20             MR. BASOMBRIO:  That would have said  21             JUSTICE ALITO:  We look to the gravamen of 22 the whole thing and we say, well, the tort claims are in 23 Austria and therefore she can't bring this breach of 24 contract claim in the United States? 25             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Well, if she had been  if
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
62 1 she had been hurt and in addition to that, they would 2 have told her  3             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, exactly what happened 4 here, plus she said they made me pay extra. 5             MR. BASOMBRIO:  Then the gravamen would 6 still be Austria because that's where all those events 7 took place. 8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 9 The case is submitted. 10             (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the 11 aboveentitled matter was submitted.) 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
