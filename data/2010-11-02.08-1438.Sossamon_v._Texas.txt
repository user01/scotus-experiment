1 P R O C E E D I N G S. 2 (11:06 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument next in Case 09-400, Staub v. Proctor Hospital. 5 Mr. Schnapper. 6 MR. RUSSELL: Actually, it's Mr. Russell. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm 8 looking ahead. And, oh, I've got the argument wrong, 9 too. 10 We will hear argument in 08-1438, 11 Sossamon v. Texas. 12 You don't look like Mr. Schnapper. Mr. 13 Russell. 14 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL 15 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 16 MR. RUSSELL: By accepting Federal funds for 17 its prisons, Texas consented to suit for appropriate 18 relief for violations of the Religious Land Use and 19 Institutionalized Persons Act. The question in this 20 case is whether that appropriate relief encompasses 21 damages. If you simply asked what kind of relief is 22 generally appropriate against a State, the answer would 23 be no relief, not even an injunction, because States 24 ordinarily are not subject even to suit without their 25 consent. And so RLUIPA necessarily asks a more precise
3

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 question, and that is what relief is appropriate against 2 a State that has consented to be sued for violations of 3 this sort. Damages, for example, are perfectly 4 appropriate against a State that has consented to be 5 sued for breach of contract. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, what would it be, 7 Mr. Russell, if there were a suit under RFRA because a 8 Federal penal institution was not allowing for the 9 religious practices that the act protects? 10 MR. RUSSELL: In - 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In a suit under RFRA, 12 could there be -- would damages be an appropriate 13 remedy? 14 MR. RUSSELL: In our view they are, although 15 it's a different context, and we recognize that the 16 government disagrees with us on that. We can't point to 17 the Spending Clause-contract analogy that applies with 18 respect to Spending Clause legislation as RFRA applies 19 to the Federal Government. But there are other 20 indications, including for example the long tradition of 21 damages being appropriate relief for the violation of 22 civil rights. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, could we back up. 24 You are saying you could get them against the Federal 25 Government too, but the government doesn't think so?

1 MR. RUSSELL: That is our view, although we 2 recognize that RLUIPA is different in this respect, in 3 that it's a Spending Clause statute under which -- and 4 this Court's decision in Barnes v. Gorman makes clear 5 that damages are traditionally appropriate relief for 6 the violation of any Spending Clause statute. 7 Of course, there is also a tradition that 8 damages are for the violation of civil rights. Take 9 statutes like Title VI, Title VII, Title IX, section 504 10 of the ADA, the list goes on and on, where Congress has 11 created damages as the quintessential remedy to enforce 12 civil rights, and when Congress has subjected States to 13 suits under such statutes, it has always put them on 14 equal footing with other defendants and subjected them 15 to damages as well. But even beyond that - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: But did it use such 17 language as "appropriate relief"? 18 MR. RUSSELL: Well, for example - 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's the 20 question. Our cases say it has to be clear to the State 21 when they go into one of these schemes, it has to be 22 clear what liability they are subjecting themselves to. 23 And in these other cases I think it was clear. I don't 24 think it's clear with simply the word "appropriate 25 relief."

1 MR. RUSSELL: No, we are not saying that the 2 word "appropriate relief" in itself supplies the 3 clarity. It's looking at that language and the way the 4 court interprets statutes generally, among other things, 5 looking at the tradition of what constitutes appropriate 6 relief for a violation of this sort. 7 We do think that Barnes v. Gorman is 8 appropriate precedent in telling the court -- in telling 9 Texas what kind of relief is generally thought 10 appropriate to satisfy Congress's desire to remedy 11 violations of a Spending Clause statute. 12 We recognize, of course, that Barnes didn't 13 involve sovereign defendants, but the local governments 14 in that case had the same rights as a State would. It 15 just comes out of the Spending Clause rather than the 16 Eleventh Amendment. That is, both constitutional 17 provisions prohibit Congress from subjecting defendants 18 to damages suits under Spending Clause legislation 19 without their consent. And this Court has enforced that 20 identical constitutional right with the same clear 21 statement test derived from Pennhurst v. Halderman. 22 Even more, the contract analogy the Court 23 relied on in Barnes is no less apt simply because one of 24 the recipients is a State. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The contract
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 analogy, I suppose, would provide that the meaning of 2 the contract is interpreted against the drafter. Right? 3 MR. RUSSELL: That would have been true in 4 Barnes as well. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. So to the 6 extent the State is arguing for a restrictive 7 interpretation, it gets at least a little help from the 8 fact that the Federal Government wrote the statute. 9 MR. RUSSELL: Well, it gets the same amount 10 of help that the local governments got in Barnes, which 11 wasn't enough. And Not only does the analogy, I think, 12 apply; so does the remedy. Damages are a quintessential 13 appropriate remedy for breach of contract by a State so 14 long as the State has agreed to be sued for violation of 15 a contract. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Russell, the State 17 looks at this statute and says, oh, this statute 18 preserves the PLRA, and under the PLRA there are no 19 damages without having a physical injury. So putting 20 the PLRA together with "appropriate relief," PLRA is 21 telling us it's not appropriate relief when there is no 22 physical injury. 23 MR. RUSSELL: Well, I would say two things 24 about that. One, keep in mind that the PLRA limitations 25 only apply to incarcerated individuals. It doesn't
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 apply to the people RLUIPA protects in State-run nursing 2 homes or mental health facilities. So Congress wouldn't 3 have been thinking that appropriate relief is defined in 4 some sense by the scope of the PLRA. 5 In addition, we think that the fact that 6 Congress expressly said that the PLRA applies to limit 7 the relief that's otherwise available under RLUIPA shows 8 that Congress didn't think that the PLRA itself made the 9 relief inappropriate. It's simply that there is some 10 relief that is otherwise appropriate that will be 11 limited in some circumstances by the PLRA. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in the prison 13 setting, then, isn't it an academic question, because 14 there are not going to be damages anyway? 15 MR. RUSSELL: No, that's not true, for a 16 couple of reasons. One, there are many cases involving 17 pecuniary damages. There is destruction of religious 18 items that won't be subject to the PLRA limitation. 19 There are -- there are cases that give rise 20 to pecuniary claims. So there is destruction of a 21 religious item, a Bible or something like that. 22 There are also cases in which the violation 23 will result in a physical injury. There are cases where 24 people are deprived of food for long periods of time. 25 There is a case where a prison refused to transport an

1 inmate for medical treatment outside the facility 2 because he wouldn't take off his yarmulke. Congress, I 3 don't think would have thought that the PLRA limitations 4 rendered a damages remedy unimportant. And at the very 5 least - 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does it include punitive 7 damages? 8 MR. RUSSELL: Excuse me? 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does it include punitive 10 damages? 11 MR. RUSSELL: The statute, I think, does not 12 in light of Barnes, because Barnes said that you get 13 traditional contract remedies and punitive damages are 14 not a traditional contract remedy. 15 Beyond that tradition, though, there's also 16 textual cues in the statue itself. There are three of 17 them that I would like to focus on. I'll list them and 18 then discuss them. 19 One is the definitions section, which lumps 20 States in together with local governments in the 21 definition of "government." The second is the Federal 22 enforcement provision, which specifically allows suits 23 by the United States, but only for the equitable and 24 declaratory relief that the State says is the only thing 25 that's available under appropriate relief. And finally
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 is the fact that the statute separately already 2 authorizes suits for injunctive relief against State 3 officials, making the addition of suits against States 4 effectively surplusage unless some other kind of relief 5 is available against the State. 6 Beginning with the definitions section, this 7 Court recognized in the United States v. Nordic Village 8 that where Congress, in the Bankruptcy Act, defined 9 "governmental unit" to include both the United States 10 and a State, that Congress was making clear, quote, that 11 "States and Federal sovereigns are to be treated the 12 same for immunity purposes." 13 I think the same lesson comes out of the 14 fact that RLUIPA defines "governments" to include not 15 only States, but local governments, and subjects all 16 governments to the same cause of action for the same 17 appropriate relief. Congress was expressing there as 18 clear as it could that there was a definitional 19 equivalence between States and local government. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but -- but, I mean, 21 that means either that the Federal Government -- that 22 the State government is liable for damages just as 23 municipalities are, or that municipalities are immune to 24 suit for damages just as the States are. 25 I mean, that -- you don't know which way
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that cuts, do you? 2 MR. RUSSELL: Well, I will point you to 3 other provisions of the statute. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe let's talk 5 about them, then. 6 MR. RUSSELL: Okay. One is the fact that, 7 as I mentioned before, the statute -- and I think the 8 State agrees -- already allows suits for injunctive 9 relief against State officials in their official 10 capacity. The only thing that adding States as 11 defendant would accomplish in light of that would simply 12 be a change in the caption of the lawsuit, unless States 13 are subject to some relief that State officials under Ex 14 parte Young are not. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, except this would 16 be a violation of a statute, not a violation of a 17 constitutional right. So under Ex parte Young they 18 couldn't necessarily get an injunction. 19 MR. RUSSELL: Well, I would set aside the 20 question of whether Ex parte Young applies of its own 21 force. I think by defining "officials" as a form of 22 government and authorizing suits for appropriate relief 23 against officials, I think everybody agrees that that 24 authorizes suits against the officials for at least 25 injunctive relief.
11

1 And then the question is, well, what does it 2 accomplish to also authorize suits against States? And 3 I think the obvious answer is it authorizes a damages 4 claim against the State. And even in light of Barnes, 5 the State seems to acknowledge that damages are 6 appropriate relief against local governments under this 7 statute. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I can conceive of a 9 case where -- where the State's violation of RLUIPA 10 consists of a State statute that simply deprives the 11 individual of his rights under RLUIPA. 12 What State official would you -- would you 13 sue? It seems to me you couldn't sue the State 14 legislature, so it would make sense to have an 15 injunction against the State. 16 MR. RUSSELL: I think it's common in that 17 circumstance to sue the State attorney general for Ex 18 parte Young relief, for example, if you have a 19 constitutional claim against the statute, as may very 20 well have happened in the California case, or the 21 governor, I guess. So I don't think that naming - 22 having a State as a defendant is necessary for that 23 purpose here. 24 In addition, as I mentioned before, I think 25 even the State acknowledges that damages are appropriate
12

1 relief against local governments, but Congress made 2 clear that when it intended the identity of a party to 3 result in a dramatically different scope of relief, it 4 did so expressly, and you can see that in the U.S. 5 enforcement provision. There, Congress specially 6 authorized suits by the United States and had its own 7 remedial provision which provides only for declaratory 8 and injunctive relief. 9 And that shows both that Congress didn't 10 expect courts to simply figure out that different kinds 11 of defendants would be subject to different appropriate 12 relief, but also - 13 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it argued that a 14 possible purpose of that was to make it clear that the 15 Federal Government couldn't sue a State to recover money 16 that had been given to it? 17 MR. RUSSELL: Well, the fact -- I would say 18 two things about that. One is Congress didn't limit 19 that provision to suits against States. It's anybody 20 who gets sued by the United States is limited to 21 equitable injunctive relief. 22 And that's, again, an example of Congress 23 treating States the same as everybody else. Whether 24 they are sued by the United States or sued by a private 25 party, it is the same relief. It's the same remedial
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 provision and we think that suggests the same relief. 2 That provision also kind of -- the language 3 of that provision, "injunctive or declaratory relief," 4 stands in pretty stark contrast to the facially broader 5 phrase "appropriate relief" in the general provision. 6 In addition to RLUIPA itself, I think it's 7 also worth pointing out that the State had independent 8 notice under section 2000(d)(7) -- this is the 9 Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, where Congress 10 made clear to Texas that it would be subject to suit for 11 damages under any statute that -- under a section of any 12 statute that prohibits discrimination by Federal funding 13 recipients. 14 And I think the question here boils down to 15 whether RLUIPA is materially distinguishable from 16 section 504, which is listed in section 2000(d)(7) as an 17 example of a statute prohibiting discrimination. And 18 if -- I think that means that the catch-all has to at 19 least be broad enough to encompass section 504, and in 20 our view, the two statutes are not distinguishable. 21 Both prohibit both the kind of disparate treatment of 22 similarly-situated individuals that the State 23 acknowledges constitutes discrimination and requires 24 accommodations in some circumstances. 25 JUSTICE ALITO: You addressed the -- the
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 effect of the issue here on persons who are in State 2 institutions other than penal institutions. 3 What would be -- what's the effect of the 4 issue here on land use restrictions? Are there many 5 cases in which issues involving land use restrictions 6 are -- are raised in litigation against the State as 7 opposed to a municipality? 8 MR. RUSSELL: It's quite rare. I am aware 9 of one pending case in Vermont where there is a 10 challenge to a -- a State environmental regulation, but 11 for the most part it isn't. 12 But if this Court were to, you know, 13 section -- the provision that we are talking about here 14 applies to land use as well as to institutionalized 15 persons, and one would ordinarily think that the statute 16 would have the same meaning depending on context. 17 I recognize that the State's basic argument 18 is that the meaning changes depending on who the 19 defendant is, and I suppose if you accept that it could 20 also depend on -- on what provision is being applied. 21 But that's not normally how statutes work. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the answer to 23 Justice Alito's question is that in the land use area, 24 zoning for example, those are mostly cases against 25 municipalities or counties?
15

1 MR. RUSSELL: That is correct. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not against the State. 3 MR. RUSSELL: That is correct. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The government is going to 5 tell us that the standard for waiver with respect to the 6 Federal Government is different from the standard with 7 respect to the State. Do you -- I think that's what 8 they are going to tell us. Do you agree with that? 9 MR. RUSSELL: No. I actually don't 10 understand them to be making that argument, either. But 11 I know for sure that that's not our position. And the 12 Court's decision in Barnes I think, for example, is 13 entirely consistent with the Court's recent decisions, 14 including for example in Richlin, where it's made clear 15 that when you are considering the scope of waiver of 16 sovereign immunity, you engage in ordinary statutory 17 interpretation and then the sovereign is respected. If 18 at the end of that interpretation the statute remains 19 unclear, you know, certainly the sovereign wins. But - 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that 21 the States are in need of special protection. With - 22 with the Congress, if it's a Federal immunity, the 23 Congress can always -- always change its law. 24 MR. RUSSELL: Well - 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That just can't happen

1 with the State. 2 MR. RUSSELL: I don't know that this Court's 3 cases support the idea that -- that heightened clear 4 statement rule for States versus the Federal Government. 5 If anything, I think they suggest the opposite, but so 6 long as the statute is clear. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's the suggestion of the 8 opposite that -- that I am trying -- I am trying to 9 explore. 10 You have your white light on. 11 MR. RUSSELL: Thank you. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 13 Russell. 14 Ms. Harrington. 15 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON, 16 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 17 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 18 MS. HARRINGTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 19 it please the Court: 20 The Respondent in this case agrees that when 21 it accepts Federal funds for its correctional system it 22 voluntarily waives its sovereign immunity to private 23 suits in Federal court to enforce RLUIPA, and it is 24 clear under this Court's decisions in cases such as 25 Franklin and Barnes that that voluntary waiver
17
Alderson Reporting Company

1 encompasses a waiver to suits for money damages. 2 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose Congress passes a 3 statute that creates a private right of action against 4 both the Federal Government and against the States and 5 in both instances authorizes all appropriate relief. 6 Are damages available in the action against the Federal 7 Government as well as the State government? 8 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, it would depend on 9 the context to answer both questions. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the State -- the State 11 provision is a Spending Clause provision. 12 MS. HARRINGTON: Then the answer would be 13 yes as to the States. This Court has been clear in 14 cases such as Franklin and Barnes that in the Spending 15 Clause context, unless Congress indicates an intent to 16 rebut the presumption somehow - 17 JUSTICE ALITO: And what about the Federal 18 Government? 19 MS. HARRINGTON: In the Federal Government 20 probably not, although this Court has looked to 21 background principles in interpreting words such as 22 "appropriate." 23 JUSTICE ALITO: What sense does it make? 24 Other than -- I know you are representing a client and 25 so special pleading for your client is -- is to be
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 expected, but I find that very difficult to accept. If 2 "all appropriate relief" includes damages as against the 3 State that accepts Federal money, then you know, what's 4 good for the State should be good for the Federal 5 Government. 6 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I would say two 7 things. First, in both cases what you want is a clear 8 statement of an intent to waive the sovereign's 9 immunity, either by the Federal Government or the State 10 government. And also that it's important to keep in 11 mind that in cases such as Franklin and Barnes, this 12 Court was construing statutes that did not say anything 13 about what remedies were appropriate, didn't mention 14 remedies whatsoever. 15 And so we don't rely so much on RLUIPA's use 16 of the phrase "appropriate relief" as we do on the 17 Spending Clause context. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But those cases did not 19 involve States, right? 20 MS. HARRINGTON: Those cases did not involve 21 States, that's true. But - 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I think that the - 23 the core question here is the State -- and Justice Alito 24 just posed it: the State is being treated with less 25 dignity than the Federal Government, because your
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 position is that the Federal Government is shielded by 2 its sovereign immunity, and you say the State is not. 3 MS. HARRINGTON: On the contrary, as to the 4 dignity point, Your Honor, if -- the State voluntarily 5 waives its immunity when it accepts Federal funds that 6 clearly condition the acceptance of the funds on the 7 waiver of its immunity. The State in this case doesn't 8 contest that it has waived its sovereign immunity 9 voluntarily to some universe of suits to enforce RLUIPA. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we are talking about 11 general principles of interpretation and the proposition 12 that we are suggesting is that the State surely should 13 be entitled to the same dignity, the same protection 14 against suits as the Federal Government, and you suggest 15 just the opposite. 16 MS. HARRINGTON: No, Your Honor. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me that's 18 contrary to standard principles of the Federal -- of 19 protecting the Federal balance. 20 MS. HARRINGTON: If you were construing a 21 State statute that voluntarily waived its own immunity, 22 then you might -- we might say the use of appropriate 23 relief in that statute should be construed the same as 24 the use of appropriate relief in RFRA. But in this case 25 you are not talking about a State's waiver of its
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 immunity through its -- through statutory language. The 2 Court said in College Savings Bank that when a -- when a 3 State takes Federal funds that are conditioned on a 4 waiver of immunity, it is the act of accepting the funds 5 that is the waiver and it waives its immunity to suits 6 to the extent that it has noticed that it is doing so. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it's -- but it's only 8 because they accept the funds at all that the Spending 9 -- that the Spending Clause is even operative. 10 MS. HARRINGTON: That's right. But again, 11 it's -- it's the act of accepting the funds that are 12 clearly conditioned that constitutes the waiver. So 13 that the waiver - 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the waiver -- I mean, 15 on the State side they can say it says "appropriate 16 relief." All right; we accept that we are going to be 17 vulnerable to an injunction suit. But we're the State 18 and it's our treasury, and it is not appropriate relief. 19 We didn't waive it. It's not -- doesn't say in the 20 Spending Clause legislation that we open up our 21 treasury. 22 MS. HARRINGTON: But there is no basis in 23 either the Eleventh Amendment or the statutory 24 provisions in RLUIPA for distinguishing relief of an 25 injunctive nature from relief in damages against the
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 State. The Eleventh Amendment talks about suits in law 2 and in equity, and there is nothing in RLUIPA that would 3 give the States notice that they are waiving their 4 immunity to suits for injunctive relief, but not give 5 them notice that they are waiving their immunity to 6 suits for money damages. This Court - 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: The word "appropriate" - 8 the word "appropriate" would -- would suggest that to 9 me. If -- if I'm a State attorney general, and I -- I 10 know that the rule is sovereign immunity and -- and 11 especially with regard to raids on the State treasury, I 12 think it would be at least plausible that I would -- I 13 would read "appropriate relief" not to include monetary 14 relief. 15 And we have said -- the language from our 16 cases -- Lane says a waiver of sovereign immunity must 17 be unequivocally expressed in the statutory text and 18 will be strictly construed in terms of its scope in 19 favor of the sovereign. That's -- that's a high test. 20 MS. HARRINGTON: But even - 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and although I might 22 sit down and come out with a conclusion after intensive 23 study that yes, maybe the best reading of this statute 24 is that it allows money damages, I find it hard to say 25 that it is unequivocally expressed in the statutory
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 text. 2 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, two things if I 3 could, Your Honor. In Lane v. Pena, the question before 4 the Court was it wasn't -- it was outside the Spending 5 Clause context, because the question was whether section 6 504 of the Rehabilitation Act applied to the Federal 7 Government, and when the Federal Government applies, 8 even in the Spending Clause context, conditions on 9 itself there is no contract-like relationship. But the 10 second thing this Court said in Barnes - 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you deny that it has 12 to be unequivocal? 13 MS. HARRINGTON: It has to be unequivocal, 14 but -- but the context in which you are construing 15 whether -- whether the sovereign is expressing its 16 intent to waive its immunity is different when you are 17 talking about the Federal Government applying 18 obligations on itself than when you are talking about 19 the Federal Government offering money to a State in - 20 in exchange for its agreeing to comply with - 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that has nothing to 22 do with whether the language is clear or not to 23 constitute a waiver. There is no principle of law that 24 you are articulating that says it -- it has to be - 25 this is not clear enough for the Federal Government, but
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 it is clear enough for the State. "Appropriate relief" 2 either has a meaning or it doesn't. 3 MS. HARRINGTON: Right. And again, we are 4 not relying so much on the use of the phrase 5 "appropriate relief" in the statute. What that -- the 6 work that does is it affirms that the background 7 presumption of the Bell v. Hood cases applies to proper 8 defendants under RLUIPA, which include State 9 governments. 10 But as this Court said in Barnes, when a - 11 when a recipient of Federal funds takes the funds, it is 12 on notice that it is going to be subject not only to the 13 remedies explicitly provided in the text of the relevant 14 legislation, but also to remedies that are traditionally 15 available in suits for breach of contract, and those 16 include compensatory damages and injunctive relief. 17 Now the State would have this Court turn 18 that presumption, in terms of traditional contract 19 rules, on its head by saying that this -- that this 20 Court should hold that the State presumptively waived 21 its immunity to suits for injunctive relief but not for 22 damages. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you say about -- I 24 think I read in one of these briefs that what I think is 25 the most relevant similar statute, RFRA, has been held

1 not to encompass the same word -- not to encompass the 2 monetary relief, and also there was some legislative 3 history where people testified and told Congress at the 4 time that the word "appropriate" won't encompass 5 monetary relief. Am I remembering that correctly? 6 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I would give you the 7 same answer I just gave, which is that we are not 8 pointing so much to the use of the -- using the phrase 9 "appropriate relief" in the statute as we are to the 10 Spending Clause context. And this Court has held that 11 when there is these conditions placed on Federal funds, 12 the recipient of the funds understands when it takes the 13 money that when it intentionally violates the conditions 14 to which it has agreed it will be subject to suit for 15 money damages. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you're 17 bracketing the State with counties and municipalities. 18 It really comes down to a question -- who decides 19 whether the state fisc is touched. And why isn't it 20 most appropriate for this Court to say, Congress can 21 call it either way, but our rule is, Congress, if you 22 want to reach the State treasury, you have to say so 23 explicitly. And then there is no doubt when the State 24 enters a contract that it's going to be subject to money 25 damages as well as injunctive relief.

1 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, this Court has 2 consistently applied a clear notice requirement to 3 conditions that Congress places on Federal funds. That 4 clear notice requirement arose out of cases like 5 Pennhurst and South Dakota v. Dole, in which there were 6 State recipients of Federal funds. And the Court said 7 that the validity of Congress's constitutional action in 8 exercising its Spending Clause authority depends on it 9 giving the recipients of the funds clear notice of the 10 conditions that they are agreeing to because of the 11 contract-like nature of Spending Clause legislation. 12 Now, that same rule was applied in Franklin 13 and Gebser and Davis and Dole, even though the 14 defendants in those cases were not sovereigns. It's 15 still the same notice requirement and there is no reason 16 to think that a county government would be able to 17 understand, would be on notice that it would be subject 18 to compensatory damages suits, and a State government 19 would not. To be sure, the State government has more to 20 give up. It might be a harder choice for the State 21 about whether to take the money or not. But the choice 22 is the State's, and when it says yes, I'm going to take 23 this money, it agrees to the conditions that are 24 attached to the money. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

1 MS. HARRINGTON: Thank you. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Ho. 3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES C. HO 4 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 5 MR. HO: The phrase "appropriate relief" is 6 a textbook example of ambiguity, not unmistakable 7 clarity. And that should end the inquiry. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If it is, why is 9 injunctive relief included at all? Meaning, what you 10 seem to be saying to me is that no relief should be 11 appropriate, because no relief is clear whether it's 12 injunctive relief or damages? 13 MR. HO: We agree with the U.S.'s reading of 14 RFRA. The same should attach here. There is an express 15 cause of action. So that cause of action has to do 16 something and we are applying to that express cause of 17 action the narrowest reading, which is - 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Some would say that 19 injunctive relief attaches more to the public FISC then 20 compensatory relief. Because future conduct or change 21 of conduct can have an enormous intrusion on the public 22 FISC, so why do we draw the line between saying one is 23 more intrusive than the other? 24 MR. HO: Two answers, Your Honor. The 25 traditional line drawing that you see in sovereign
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 immunity is injunctive relief. Any prospective relief 2 is less intrusive on sovereign immunity than any form of 3 retrospective relief, damages and that sort of thing. 4 But especially true in this context, because when you 5 talk about the Spending Clause, we can walk away from 6 injunctive relief, from an injunction at any time. We 7 can simply stop receiving the funds and stop accepting 8 the funds and the injunction evaporates, but we can't 9 walk away from a damage remedy. So we are construing 10 the express cause of action in RLUIPA, like in RFRA, to 11 do the judicial minimum. Which is that judicial relief 12 which requires states to do what we are already required 13 to do, which is to comply with the substantial burden 14 mandatory under RLUIPA. So the fact that appropriate 15 relief is essentially inherently ambiguous should end 16 the analysis, because after all, the Court is required 17 unmistakably clear text and rejected merely permissible 18 inferences for two reasons, to ensure both careful, 19 robust deliberation by Congress before disturbing the 20 federal state balance of power, as well as to ensure 21 clear notice. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: I was looking at the cases 23 the best I can at the moment. I think you might say 24 that there are a lot of cases which interpret the word 25 "appropriate relief" to include monetary relief. And
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 then there is some that don't. And to get a rule out of 2 them, you would have to say, well, they are looking to 3 context. And in context it sometimes is clear, 4 sometimes occasionally not. But here, isn't this and 5 maybe this was asked, but I want your answer. The 6 context here, the words appropriate relief, govern both 7 the prison situation and the land use situation, don't 8 they? You are given an action when the government 9 through a general land use regulation infringes 10 somebody's right to build, for example. Now, wouldn't 11 that kind of interference with the use of property quite 12 often and normally require some kind of monetary 13 compensation? This isn't just the odd thing in a 14 prison, where it's talking about it might be called 15 building a religious building or building some kind of 16 parking, all kinds of things that have monetary 17 compensation. Do you see my question? 18 MR. HO: I think I do, Your Honor. First of 19 all, we certainly agree that your premise, which is that 20 context matters, the Court has said specifically 21 appropriate relief can enlarge or contract, it could be 22 mean monetary or it could mean not monetary, so it does 23 depend on context. I confess that your question is 24 interesting, we are obviously focused on section 3. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but isn't it the
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 same word that governs both? 2 MR. HO: It is the same word. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: If it's the same word that 4 governs both and if land cases very often involve claims 5 for money, I would think that would cut against you. 6 But that's why I ask. I want to get your response. 7 MR. HO: Well, we are still looking for 8 express language in the text. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: But there are loads of 10 cases that have nothing more than appropriate relief and 11 in those cases context makes it clear. The only one 12 really I thought strongly -- your strongest case seems 13 to me to be RFRA. 14 MR. HO: RFRA certainly is the direct 15 context from which the words appropriate relief in this 16 statute are drawn. And RFRA, of course, is land use, 17 it's prisons, it's anything, RFRA applies to the federal 18 government or any activity under the sun. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh. 20 MR. HO: So for that reason alone, I think 21 we might resist the notion that the specific uses of 22 appropriate relief in RLUIPA would somehow provide any 23 sort of change or certainly any expectation that we 24 would have or that Congress would have, for that matter, 25 that the words appropriate relief would take on a new
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 meaning just because it's land use. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, so often, what I'm 3 thinking of, a church wands to build, and they can't 4 because of a land restriction. And it turns out that 5 that land restriction violates this statute. And in the 6 meantime they have had to rent buildings, they have had 7 to maybe build somewhere else and they have had to do 8 all kinds of things that cost money. And that's why I 9 would think in that context money would be a natural 10 thing. 11 MR. HO: I'm not sure though - 12 JUSTICE BREYER: To fulfill appropriateness. 13 MR. HO: I'm actually not sure that that 14 would be true even in that context. Certainly anybody 15 might want money, but when it comes to what Congress has 16 indicated and what states would expect, I would imagine 17 that the federal government's biggest interest is in 18 making sure that states and other recipients use the 19 money for what it's supposed to be for, comply with the 20 substantial burden mandate. And a local government is 21 not doing so with regard to a church, then they should 22 be enjoined so that they would be required to comply 23 with it. If anything, damages might exacerbate the 24 problem just in the sense that we are now taking federal 25 money and applying damages to it.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought a local 2 government would be subject to damages. We are talking 3 about the state. 4 MR. HO: We are talking about the state, 5 Your Honor. To be clear, we do not actually concede 6 that damages would even be available against a local 7 government. Our point here is that simply it doesn't 8 matter for us, because we obviously are treated very 9 differently from local governments. I think they have, 10 both the Petitioner and U.S. have indicated that the 11 statute should treat state and locals the same way. The 12 problem with that is the Constitution obviously treats 13 states and locals very differently. The Constitution 14 treats the state and federal government in the same way, 15 in that both enjoy sovereign immunity and included in 16 that are the principles of sovereign immunity, the need 17 for specific waiver, not just a clear waiver, but 18 specific as to the scope of the waiver, and specific as 19 to the remedies. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now we have three 21 distinctions. With respect to land use discrimination, 22 the Rehab Act would presumably apply. So the Rehab Act 23 says compensatory damages are permissible for that kind 24 of discriminatory claim, so now we have compensatory 25 damages for that. We have, potentially, compensatory
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 damages for local governments, but not for State or 2 Federal level. 3 We are chopping up the statute at each 4 stage, correct? We are treating different defendants 5 differently and different claims differently with 6 respect to the relief that's permissible? 7 MR. HO: That would not be our submission, 8 Your Honor. If we are talking about the 2000d(7) 9 language, all that 2000(d)(7) says if you are a 10 provision prohibiting discrimination, then you get the 11 same remedies against a State that you would get against 12 any other nonsovereign defendant. And if we were 13 representing the City of Austin, we actually would 14 argue -- we think we have a good argument -- that 15 damages would not be available even against the City of 16 Austin. Our point here is simply that - 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you explain why? 18 MR. HO: Sure. I think if I were the City 19 of Austin, I would make three arguments. One, the words 20 "appropriate relief" are in the statute. I think 21 they -- the other one wants to read this as surplusage. 22 We would think that the words "appropriate relief" 23 should do something, and we note that there were several 24 justices who dissented in West v. Gibson, noting that 25 the words "appropriate relief" seemed to indicate
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 equitable discretion, or discretion, and therefore 2 equitable relief. 3 In addition, we will note that the words 4 "appropriate relief" in (4)(A) - 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But equity permits money 6 as well. Equity permits money as well. 7 MR. HO: In some limited formats, but it 8 wouldn't be compensatory damages in the sense that we 9 are talking about in this case. 10 An additional indication would be the fact 11 that the words "appropriate relief" aren't just attached 12 to the claim. It's attached to both claim or defense. 13 And of course it makes no sense to say that you can get 14 money damages by asserting RLUIPA as a defense. 15 So for all those reasons, the City of Austin 16 might actually have a good case that damages aren't 17 available even against them. Of course, it doesn't 18 matter for our case, because the whole point is if the 19 City of Austin were to lose due to Barnes and Franklin, 20 what we know for sure here is that Barnes and Franklin 21 have nothing, nothing whatsoever, to do with the States. 22 If I may, I would like to spend a little bit 23 of time on that issue. 24 JUSTICE ALITO: Before you do that, Barnes 25 and Franklin were cases involving implied rights of
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 action; isn't that right? 2 MR. HO: Yes. With the 2000d(7) backdrop, 3 but yes, Your Honor. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I'm -- this one 6 question may be covered, but can you give me any 7 examples where States have turned down money under the 8 Spending Clause, say we don't want it, the restrictions 9 are too great? Does this happen all the time, or ever? 10 MR. HO: Where States turn down money? 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Where States tell the 12 Federal Government: No, thank you, we don't want the 13 money. 14 MR. HO: It's starting to happen in Texas. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under programs like this? 16 MR. HO: I don't -- I can't think of a 17 situation where Texas has turned down RLUIPA Federal 18 prison money. But there - 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean other States - 20 they say, oh, the liabilities are just too great, we 21 don't want it? 22 MR. HO: I'm not aware of any State in the 23 country that has turned down Federal prison funds. Of 24 course, if damages were somehow inflicted, if Congress 25 changed the law, perhaps States would start to
35

Alderson Reporting Company

1 recalibrate that decision. 2 Their core argument is that we should just 3 extend Franklin and Barnes to States. The fatal flaw 4 with that argument is that the very principle on which 5 Franklin and Barnes apply -- are premised, that 6 principle does not apply to sovereigns. When Congress 7 passes a cause of action and is silent or ambiguous with 8 respect to the remedies, there is a traditional 9 presumption that we apply. Non-sovereigns now expect to 10 be subject to any possible remedy under the sun. 11 Precisely the opposite rule applies to 12 sovereigns. We know that for sure as a matter of 13 precedent in Lane, which rejected Franklin as applied to 14 a sovereign. We also know this as a more fundamental 15 basic principle of sovereign immunity, because when it 16 comes to sovereigns, we have to have not only a clear 17 waiver, but also a waiver that is specific to the remedy 18 that is being sought. 19 These two rules can't be reconciled. You 20 either can apply the traditional presumption of all 21 remedies, or you apply the other rule that sovereigns 22 benefit from. 23 Petitioner claims that maybe a special rule 24 should apply that is unique to the Spending Clause, that 25 maybe that's a way to get around the sovereign immunity
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 problem, but we submit that fundamentally misreads 2 Franklin and Barnes, because what's doing the work in 3 Franklin and Barnes isn't the Spending Clause. It's 4 actually quite the opposite. The Spending Clause is 5 cutting back against the traditional presumption. 6 In Franklin -- I will take each case in 7 turn. In Franklin, you see pages and pages of analysis 8 in section 2 of the opinion, where there is exhaustive 9 research about Bell v. Hood and the traditional 10 presumptions that the Court has applied for decades 11 under any thought of Federal power. 12 The Spending Clause makes an appearance in 13 Franklin only at the very end in section 4, invoked by 14 the defense as a potential reason not to apply the 15 traditional presumption. The court, you know, gets past 16 that on the grounds that the traditional presumption is 17 so strong that it does provide the clarity for 18 non-sovereigns. It doesn't indisputably apply to 19 non-sovereigns; why not apply it under the Spending 20 Clause as well? 21 The point, though, is it's not the Spending 22 Clause that does the work. It is -- it is the 23 traditional presumption. That has even more dramatic 24 force in Barnes v. Gorman. Mr. Gorman would have had a 25 $1.2 million punitive damage award that he would have
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 been entitled to, except for the fact that this was a 2 Spending Clause case, and that's precisely why he lost 3 that punitive damage award. 4 So put simply, yes, it could be that under 5 Barnes and Franklin, remedies would be clear enough in 6 that one context. The problem is it's not clear enough 7 in this context, because sovereigns present a completely 8 different constitutional context. 9 I want to address very quickly Justice 10 Sotomayor's question about Ex parte Young. I think you 11 were exactly right that Ex parte -- that our reading 12 isn't in any way redundant with Ex parte Young, but I 13 want to note an additional reason why we are not 14 redundant. 15 We need to confirm, Congress needed to 16 confirm, that there was in fact a privately enforceable 17 right, and that's why our reading in no way renders the 18 Ex parte Young concept redundant. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do with the 20 practical problem that's been brought up that if a State 21 is sued, it can release the prisoner, it can transfer 22 the prisoner, and then no relief is appropriate? That 23 the only way that the State is going to take its 24 obligation seriously is if it's exposed to compensatory 25 damages?
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. HO: If a prisoner is transferred, 2 released, or the State simply changes its mind and gives 3 up and provides the accommodation, in all those 4 situations, the prisoner is no longer suffering from the 5 complaint of condition. That's why this Court's 6 mootness doctrines would apply. 7 Put another way, mootness is really just 8 another word for settlement, and we would think that 9 settlement, the State essentially capitulating and 10 saying: Our bad, we should have complied, we should 11 have provided the accommodation, that actually 12 vindicates the purpose of RLUIPA, and indeed, it avoids 13 the need for costly litigation to do so. 14 I want to mention briefly the U.S. - 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the inducement to 16 do it more quickly rather than to delay, to remedy the 17 wrong faster rather than to delay? 18 MR. HO: The reason to do it? 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Uh-huh. 20 MR. HO: Simply to avoid litigation. I 21 mean, the way this works practically on the ground, 22 prisons obviously have a lot to deal with, a lot of 23 security concerns. They set general policies. They may 24 not be aware that their policy might have an application 25 for a certain individual of a particular faith. If
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that's brought to their attention and - 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's an ideal world, 3 that they'll respond, but there is an allegation that 4 some prisons wait until the eve of the trial after 5 onerous discovery on the plaintiff and after enormous 6 harm to plaintiffs, physical and otherwise, before they 7 capitulate. So what's the inducement? 8 MR. HO: Well, the inducement is to - 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To move faster. 10 MR. HO: States are -- States are suffering 11 the litigation costs as well. We are not in the 12 business to litigate just because we want to. We have 13 plenty of other suits to deal with. 14 This very case, I think, is a good example. 15 Once the prisoner -- once Mr. Sossamon agreed with 16 respect to the salt restriction policy, we immediately 17 abandoned that policy, before litigation was even filed. 18 With respect to the U.S. cause of action 19 provision, there was an argument that appropriate relief 20 has to mean damages, because otherwise just take that 21 declaratory or injunctive relief language and put it 22 into the private cause of action. The reason that 23 argument doesn't work is because these are two 24 fundamentally different provisions. 25 There is (4)(F) of RFRA, which is the U.S.
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 cause of action, and there was (4)(A) of -- I'm sorry, 2 of RLUIPA -- and there is (4)(A) of RLUIPA, which is not 3 just a private cause of action, but also a defense. So 4 again, if you can imagine sticking in the words 5 "declaratory and injunctive relief" and putting it right 6 into (4)(A), it doesn't work. It doesn't make any 7 sense, because what person asserting a defense would 8 seek an injunctive relief? If you take what's - 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Let me ask -- get this 10 information from you. As I understand it, there are 11 some cases that find the words "appropriate relief" in a 12 statute to include damages and there's some that don't. 13 Let's look at the ones that don't. 14 There is some where it's pretty hard to do 15 it because it's in a heading called "injunction," and 16 that's obvious. But there are only two statutes, 17 really, where the courts have ever held in significant 18 numbers that the word "appropriate relief" does not 19 include money damages. One is the IDEA, the 20 Disabilities Act, and the other is RFRA. 21 Is there anything else that you've come 22 across? 23 MR. HO: Those are two great examples. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but are there any 25 others? I mean, I just want to get down on a piece of
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 paper what I have to look at. 2 MR. HO: Sure. I think there are two -- two 3 great examples. I would note - 4 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you don't 5 have any others, I'm judging from your hesitation. 6 MR. HO: No, no -- I would actually -- I 7 would note there are two other cases - 8 JUSTICE BREYER: What? 9 MR. HO: -- that I would refer you to, and 10 of course discussed in the briefs. West v. Gibson which 11 talks about how the words appropriate relief, remedies 12 in that context, by definition have no fixed meaning; 13 they can't possibly have fixed meaning. So it has to 14 enlarge or contract. And prior to 1991 -- prior to 1991 15 amendment at issue in that case -- the Court would 16 unanimously agreed that appropriate relief would not 17 have included money damages. 18 Ruckelshaus provides similar guidance, in 19 that I think the phrase was, there was no possible -- no 20 comprehensible or principled meaning to the phrase 21 "appropriate" as attached to a remedy. 22 I will briefly touch on the 2000d-7 issue 23 unless there are questions about that. Assuming the 24 issue is even preserved for this Court's consideration, 25 2000d-7 doesn't allow relief, either. I think there are
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 a lot of reasons why that would be so, but I think the 2 simplest is simply to acknowledge the difference between 3 section 2 of RLUIPA and section 3. 4 Section 2 of RLUIPA is much like the four 5 provisions expressly enumerated in 2000d-7, in that all 6 of them have the word discrimination and more 7 importantly turn on the concept of discrimination. A 8 discrimination is an element of a cause of action under 9 section 2, or under any of the four provisions 10 enumerated. 11 By contrast section 3 is not. You can have 12 discrimination as -- as part of your fact background if 13 you want but it will have nothing whatsoever to do with 14 whether have you a valid section 3 claim or not. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you have already 16 addressed this but I think it's their -- the position of 17 your friend on the other side of the case is that with 18 the Spending Clause you have a contract. The State has 19 some extra protection, and therefore we need not be 20 quite so strict in -- in construing waivers -- waivers 21 of immunity, because you have the contract. 22 Can you comment on that argument? And - 23 and you might want to say that the Spending Clause is 24 potentially so sweeping that the State should have 25 special protection and we should be particularly careful
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 about the clear statement rule. 2 Or do you think the clear statement rule 3 applies with equal force whether it's a Spending Clause 4 or a direct regulation under say, the Fourteenth 5 Amendment? 6 MR. HO: I'll try to take each of those 7 points in turn. 8 We don't see anything in the law that 9 suggests that sometimes there is a clear statement rule 10 and sometimes there is a super-duper clear statement 11 rule. I think there has been some suggestion -- or 12 maybe there has not been any more; I'm not sure; I read 13 the briefs the same way, I think the same way that the 14 Justices did. But they seem not to be arguing that any 15 more. 16 So it should be the same standard. I -- I 17 certainly acknowledge that when it comes to the Spending 18 Clause as you wrote in your dissent in Davis v. Monroe, 19 that the Spending Clause if anything does raise special 20 constitutional considerations as a general matter, 21 inasmuch as the Spending Clause could be used to impose 22 Federal restrictions on States that they could never 23 dream of under Article I otherwise. RLUIPA of course is 24 a prime example of that. 25 But at the end of the day, the Spending
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Clause is not doing any work with regard to providing an 2 assumption or presumption of remedies. Again, it's 3 exactly precisely the opposite. Franklin and Barnes 4 both articulate that it's the traditional presumption 5 that applies to any exercise of Federal power. That 6 traditional presumption is what's doing the work. The 7 Spending Clause if anything is a cut back. So the 8 notion that just invoking the Spending Clause suddenly 9 puts States on this fabulously clear notice, I think 10 just does not work. 11 If there are no further questions, Your 12 Honor? 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Ho. 14 MR. HO: Thank you. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Russell, you 16 have four minutes remaining. 17 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL 18 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 19 MR. RUSSELL: Thank you. 20 Nearly every argument the state made here 21 today could have been made by the local governments in 22 Barnes. Ranging from the complaint that the language 23 like appropriate relief is too unclear, to the assertion 24 that they were not on notice, that by accepting federal 25 funds they were subjecting themselves to suits. And
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that's because the local government, like any other 2 state, had the same right to the same clear statement 3 rule. Unless this Court is, in fact, going to create a 4 proliferation or hierarchy of clear statement rules, the 5 Pennhurst rule that applies in the Spending Clause 6 context of local governments applies in exactly the same 7 way to a state government under the Eleventh Amendment 8 and Barnes' Court construed the express private right of 9 action under section 504, which incorporated by 10 reference the remedies available under Title XI, which 11 this Court construed to authorize appropriate relief. 12 Exactly the same remedy that RLUIPA authorizes. And so 13 the state for the first time today has suggested that 14 the city of Austin is not bound by Barnes. I don't see 15 how they can reach that conclusion. Barnes quite 16 clearly says that the local government is subject to - 17 and is on notice that it has clear, there is a clear 18 statement in every Spending Clause statute that they are 19 subject to a damages remedy so long as they accept the 20 funds because of the contractual nature of the 21 obligation. That applies. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was that contested in 23 Barnes? 24 MR. RUSSELL: Which part, I'm sorry. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was the liability for
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 compensatory damages contested in Barnes? 2 MR. RUSSELL: No. The question in Barnes is 3 punitive. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just punitive. And there 5 is a lot of discussion, the assumption that they were 6 liable for compensatory, but it really wasn't litigated, 7 was it? 8 MR. RUSSELL: Well, the legal principle this 9 Court adopted to resolve that issue was one that, I take 10 it, was not just a principle for that case, but that in 11 general, funding recipients are on notice that they are 12 subject to contract remedies and unless this Court is 13 going to back away from that as a general matter, unless 14 the Court is going to say that Pennhurst applies 15 differently in the Spending Clause context than it does 16 in the sovereign immunity context, I don't see how you 17 can come to a different result in this case. 18 Justice Breyer, with respect to RFRA, as far 19 as I know, there is only one court of appeals case that 20 says the United States is not subject to suits and that 21 was decided six years after RLUIPA was enacted. With 22 respect to the IDEA, there are a handful of lower courts 23 decisions that say damages are unavailable. Those - 24 they give reasons that are specific to the IDEA and the 25 fact that that remedial provision is part of the due
