1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:00 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 09-1156, Matrixx Initiatives 5 v. James Siracusano. 6 Mr. Hacker. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN HACKER 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. HACKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 All drug companies receive, on an almost 12 daily basis, anecdotal hearsay reports about alleged 13 adverse health events following the use of their 14 products. Those incident reports do not themselves 15 establish any reliable facts about the drug's 16 performance or its safety, especially where, as here, 17 there are only a handful of reports out of millions of 18 products sold over a 4-year period, and - 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hacker, do we know 20 that from this record? I mean, we know that the 21 plaintiffs were able to identify -- there's some dispute 22 whether it's 12 or 23, but do you represent that there 23 were no other complaints made? So that, let's say, 24 there has been discovery; now we're just at the pleading 25 stage. The company would have said: That's it; we
3

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 didn't have any more. 2 MR. HACKER: All I can speak for is what's 3 alleged in the complaint, and the complaint, no matter 4 how read, doesn't allege any more than 23 adverse event 5 reports. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they might have been 7 able through discovery to find that there were many 8 more. 9 MR. HACKER: That's true, but there's no 10 allegation that what they -- what they know about or 11 what they could find would have been a statistically 12 significant difference between the rate of reported 13 events and the background of - 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why shouldn't that 15 determination be deferred until there's discovery, and 16 then we can know how many reports there really were? 17 MR. HACKER: Because it's incumbent on a 18 plaintiff to come to court with a case, to plead the 19 facts necessary to establish all of the elements of a 20 claim, and a securities fraud claim, of course, requires 21 both materiality and scienter. And neither of those is 22 established unless the company has knowledge of facts 23 establishing a reliable basis for inferring that the 24 drug itself is the cause of the reported event. 25 Absent information like that, there is
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 neither materiality nor scienter under the securities 2 laws, because neither the company nor an investor - 3 until there's reliable evidence of a causal link between 4 the two products, neither a company -- excuse me, a link 5 between the product and the event -- neither the company 6 nor an investor would have any reason to think that an 7 adverse event report is -- actually indicates a problem 8 with the product - 9 JUSTICE ALITO: Can there be - 10 MR. HACKER: -- as opposed to a coincidence. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: Can there be some situations 12 in which statistically significant evidence would not be 13 necessary? 14 For example, suppose some very distinguished 15 physicians concluded, based on clinical trials, that 16 there was a connection between a drug and a very serious 17 side effect. Could that establish materiality? 18 MR. HACKER: Well, I think a distinguished 19 physician would not conclude that there's a connection 20 unless the clinical trials reveal a statistically 21 significant difference between what they've seen and 22 what they would expect to see were there no association. 23 So there's that point, Your Honor. 24 But the second point I would make is we 25 acknowledge there are a very narrow, limited number of
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 circumstances under which a claim can be pled absent 2 statistically significant evidence, but that's -- that's 3 because doctors and researchers will conclude that there 4 may be causation under narrow circumstances. For 5 example, I think the most common set of criteria are the 6 Bradford-Hill criteria. But nothing like that is pled 7 here, Your Honor. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hacker, the complaint 9 did not rely exclusively upon these adverse incidents 10 but also referred to a -- a study, a report by 11 researchers at the American Rhinologic Society - 12 MR. HACKER: Yes. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- which -- which asserted 14 that there was a connection. 15 MR. HACKER: But that - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the -- is the question 17 before us simply whether in isolation the adverse 18 incidents would be enough, or is not the question 19 whether those adverse incidents placed next to this 20 study would be enough? 21 MR. HACKER: Well, two points, Your Honor. 22 First, the plaintiffs have, throughout this litigation, 23 framed their case as one based on the failure to 24 disclose adverse event reports. It's the number of 25 adverse event reports that they say is the problem, and
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 they're not saying that there was a study out there and 2 that we failed to disclose the study. They say - 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't they say that? 4 MR. HACKER: -- it's the fact of the adverse 5 event reports. Well, I think if you look at the -- now, 6 to be clear, the study is not attached to the complaint, 7 so there wasn't a basis in the complaint for saying the 8 company was aware of a reliable study, and here are the 9 details of the study, and they failed to disclose it. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I thought the - 11 you're saying the complaint did not refer to the study? 12 MR. HACKER: It did refer to it. That's 13 true. And if you look at the study, there's really 14 nothing there. It's based on -- primarily on a case 15 study of one -- and, again, this isn't in the complaint; 16 it's in the -- it is attached to the red brief, Your 17 Honor. 18 There's one case study of one man who is 55 19 year old -- 55 years old, which is the population most 20 likely to experience anosmia. You're more likely to get 21 it when you're -- he's suffering from signs of lupus, 22 which causes anosmia, and he's taking Flonase, which 23 also causes anosmia. And so the idea that you can infer 24 from that one incident out of millions over years of 25 product sales that -- that Zicam causes anosmia and that
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 there's a problem out there. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're talking about 3 -- you're talking about who's right or wrong about the 4 connection between Matrixx and anosmia. But that's not 5 the question. I'm an investor in Matrixx; I worry 6 whether my stock price is going to go down. You can 7 have some psychic come out and say Zicam is going to 8 cause a disease, with no support whatsoever, but if it 9 causes the stock to go down 20 percent, it seems to me 10 that's material. 11 MR. HACKER: But if -- that's precisely the 12 point, Your Honor. If a psychic came out or a lunatic 13 on the street corner is barking, you know, through a 14 megaphone that there's a problem with the product, 15 that's not the kind of information a -- a reasonable 16 investor would rely on. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But wait a minute. 18 These -- these weren't psychics. These were three 19 clinical doctors in this area, one of them you knew 20 poised to go to a society meeting to make this 21 allegation. 22 Doesn't it make a difference who the reports 23 are coming from and what the substance of those reports 24 may do to your product? 25 MR. HACKER: It may make a difference, Your
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Honor, and I didn't mean to suggest that, you know, 2 these are psychics. The point simply is, following up 3 on the Chief Justice's question, that it does matter 4 what the basis of the allegation, and is the evidence, 5 the facts available to the company, reliable? Does it 6 create a reliable inference that a reasonable investor 7 would be concerned about? 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose -- suppose 9 you stipulate, in response to the Chief Justice's 10 question, that it's irrational, that it's probably 11 baseless, but that the market will react adversely. Is 12 there a duty then to address the claim? 13 MR. HACKER: Under the case law, it's not 14 clear that that's true. In this case, looking at this 15 case specifically, Your Honor, when the market reacted, 16 what the market was reacting to was a Good Morning 17 America report. It's very important to be clear about 18 what that report said. 19 On Good Morning America, a leading morning 20 news program, the allegation was made by Dr. Jafek that 21 Zicam causes anosmia. That's a very different 22 allegation that what the company was -- than what it was 23 the company was aware of, which was simply the adverse 24 event reports. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But had there - 2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if there's a baseless 3 report -- and we stipulate that, although it's baseless, 4 it's going to affect the market -- could that be the 5 basis for an allegation, assuming the requisite 6 scienter, that there's liability? 7 MR. HACKER: Two answers, I would say, Your 8 Honor. First of all, we have to be very careful about 9 creating a rule through our interpretation of 10 materiality that would require companies in advance to 11 disclose the fact that a baseless, false allegation 12 about the company is going to come out because it 13 requires the company to ring the bell - 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it's not the 15 allegation. It's the fact that the market may be 16 affected. 17 MR. HACKER: Well, I understand, but the 18 problem is if the-- what the rule would say is, because 19 the company is aware the market may be affected, the 20 company in advance has to say: A false report about us 21 is about to come out. It requires the company to first 22 ring the bell and then un-ring it in the same statement, 23 and that's not a good rule for companies. 24 Shareholders wouldn't want that rule, to 25 require companies to denigrate their product and then do
10

1 their best to explain why the allegation is untrue. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hacker - 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But - 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hacker, you just 5 said, if I understood you correctly, that when the - 6 when the news came out on Good Morning America, accurate 7 or not, there was an obligation to do something about 8 it, but among the -- the charges, it's not simply that 9 there was these reports, but it's the way the company 10 responded to them: two press releases that said 11 allegations of any linkage of the drug to anosmia are 12 completely unfounded. That statement was made even 13 after the -- what was it, Dr. Jafek? 14 MR. HACKER: Right. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- had this presentation, 16 and he was going to put Zicam's name on it, and the 17 company said you don't have any permission to do that. 18 So the company prevented Good Morning America from 19 happening earlier, and it made these affirmative 20 statements that there's no linkage. 21 MR. HACKER: Well, what they said was -- and 22 this was true -- that it was completely unfounded and 23 misleading. The very scientific panel that plaintiffs 24 themselves rely on, which convened and issued its report 25 2 weeks later, confirmed that. There was no -- it's
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 absolutely unfounded at the time to - 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the 3 scientific report that came out later said we can't say 4 one way or the other, as opposed to the company saying 5 that any suggestion of linkage is completely unfounded. 6 MR. HACKER: And that's correct, there 7 isn't, when -- when the scientific panel said you can't 8 make that claim, it's unfounded, there's no basis in the 9 available science. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They didn't say 11 "unfounded." They said the evidence is not -- we can't 12 say yes and we can't say no. That's different from 13 completely unfounded. 14 MR. HACKER: Well, I'm -- with respect, Your 15 Honor, I'm not entirely sure it is. When you're talking 16 about science, you make a claim that's either supported 17 in the science or it's without support. And the point 18 the scientific panel was making is there was no support 19 in the available science, and what Jafek was relying on 20 was unreliable. As I just described, the one - 21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Hacker, you're 22 saying that the question of whether there is support is 23 reducible to the question of whether there are 24 statistically significant findings. Now, as I 25 understand it, the FDA takes action all the time as to
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 drugs -- they force the withdrawal of a drug from the 2 market, they force relabeling of a drug -- on the basis 3 of findings that are not statistically significant. 4 Now, clearly in those cases the market has a right to 5 know the very things that are going to make the FDA take 6 action against a product and that are going to severely 7 affect the product's value to the company. Not 8 statistical significance there. 9 MR. HACKER: That's true, but the problem 10 with that sort of standard -- well, first of all, to 11 emphasize -- to look at the facts of this case, the FDA 12 didn't take any action until 5 years later, but -- and 13 which shows that the - 14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it could, and 15 eventually it did. 16 MR. HACKER: But that's what - 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: And you are suggesting a 18 test for what -- what counts as material, which is 19 statistically significant, a test that the FDA itself 20 doesn't use when it thinks about what it should -- what 21 it should regulate. 22 MR. HACKER: The problem is ex ante. You 23 have to -- you can't look at this through hindsight. 24 You have to look at this ex ante. When a company has a 25 handful of reports -- it's absolutely true, nobody would
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 dispute, that some day in the distant future, with the 2 accumulation of more data, the FDA may take action based 3 on its own prophylactic public health regulatory 4 discretion. But at the time, ex ante, no company, when 5 it gets an adverse event report, can possibly know 6 whether that's enough information for the FDA to act. 7 So the prospect that the FDA may some day act on the 8 basis of additionally accumulated information would 9 require disclosure of all reports all the time, and 10 that, we submit, cannot be the standard. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hacker, suppose Good 12 Morning America made the same claim, categorically 13 saying that this drug caused this condition, but did so 14 simply on the basis of these adverse incidents, and they 15 didn't have Dr. Janner's, or whatever his name is, 16 reports, but nonetheless Good Morning America comes out, 17 and on the basis of those incidents, saying Zicam causes 18 whatever the condition is. Would that have to be 19 reported? 20 MR. HACKER: Well - 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: And if not, why not? 22 MR. HACKER: I think what you would have to 23 be hypothesizing is evidence that the company, say a 24 week in advance, knew that Good Morning America was 25 going to come out and say that, because once Good
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Morning America says it, it's said it and the effect is 2 what it is. 3 But even in the hypothetical -- you're - 4 you'd have to sort of unpack what you said. If Good 5 Morning America came out and said just what Matrixx knew 6 at the time -- there are a handful of adverse event 7 reports, there's -- it's over millions of product uses 8 over a 4-year period, and no indication that that's at 9 all in any way different from the incident rate in the 10 general population, especially among cold users, who, of 11 course, are most likely to experience anosmia -- you 12 know, we don't know what would have happened. But then 13 you add the element that Good Morning America then 14 declares that Zicam causes anosmia -- again, the 15 hypothetical would have to be in advance Matrixx is 16 aware - 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. That's - 18 MR. HACKER: -- that the false claim is 19 going to be made. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Fine. 21 MR. HACKER: Right, and I would say, first 22 of all, we have to be very careful, as I said before, 23 about a rule that requires a company to disclose false 24 facts. I would say, second, that a reasonable investor 25 doesn't want false information; a reasonable investor
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 wants accurate information. And a reasonable investor 2 would actually - 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: These are unreasonable 4 investors who are relying on some talking head on Good 5 Morning America who says that this is true - 6 MR. HACKER: And that - 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- even though it isn't 8 true. 9 MR. HACKER: And that's a third point I 10 would make, Your Honor, is it's a different case, a 11 fundamentally different case - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: No - 13 MR. HACKER: -- if you're talking about a 14 media splash. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: You haven't answered yes or 16 no. There's no basis for its being said on Good Morning 17 America, but unreasonable investors by the thousands 18 rely upon it. 19 MR. HACKER: And I think the answer is no, 20 and I think that the reason it's no - 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: No - 22 MR. HACKER: -- a qualified no, is because - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't - 24 MR. HACKER: -- the law doesn't respond to 25 irrational, unpredictable, or unreasonable investors.

1 It responds to a reasonable investor who wants 2 accurate -- a reasonable investor is going to hold the 3 stock - 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A reasonable 5 investor is going to worry about the fact that thousands 6 of unreasonable investors are going to dump their 7 Matrixx stock. 8 (Laughter.) 9 MR. HACKER: I -- I absolutely -- I 10 understand that. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- but, I mean, 12 there's nothing unreasonable about that. If it looks - 13 if you're looking at Good Morning America, you say, my 14 gosh, everybody else is going to sell this; I'm going to 15 sell, too. And if it turns out you knew about it, you 16 should have told me about it before. 17 MR. HACKER: And the point I would make is, 18 first of all, a company ex ante can't know when that's 19 going to happen. So all the hypotheticals are 20 suggesting some way of knowing the company - 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It may not know, but 22 it certainly can know. 23 MR. HACKER: And if - 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you -- if you 25 know this is a very false report, but we know that, I
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 don't know, the surgeon general, somebody, is going to 2 come out and announce it and that will cause an 3 effect - 4 MR. HACKER: And that's why it's a 5 meaningfully different case. If the plaintiffs have - 6 plead in their complaint that there's a memo inside the 7 company, for example, so this false fact is going to 8 come out, and we know it's going to cause a stock drop, 9 that would be a case involving the materiality of a 10 media splash, a big media event. 11 It can't be that there's a false claim out 12 there somewhere and the company becomes aware of the 13 false claim and then, purely hypothetically, it's 14 possible that somebody will make the false claim. It 15 becomes also possible that the media will pick up and 16 not be persuaded to ignore the false claim. 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Hacker - 18 MR. HACKER: That's the kind of case we're 19 talking about here. 20 JUSTICE KAGAN: In most cases we don't know 21 whether the claim is false or not. So let me give you a 22 hypothetical: There's a pharmaceutical company and it 23 comes out with its first and only product. It's 100 24 percent of the sales, and it's a new contact lens 25 solution. And it sells this product to many, many, many
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 hundreds of thousands of people. And most of them use 2 this product with no adverse effect whatsoever, but 3 there are 10 cases where somebody uses this product and 4 they go blind. Three of those 10 cases -- the person 5 had to borrow a contact lens from a friend, only used it 6 in the one eye; they go blind only in that one eye. 7 This is not statistically significant. 8 There is no way that anybody would tell that you these 9 10 cases are statistically significant. Would you stop 10 using that product, and would a reasonable investor want 11 to know about those 10 cases? 12 MR. HACKER: I -- I would want to know more 13 about the number of uses and all that, but, no, there 14 wouldn't be a basis. A reasonable investor would want 15 to know all the facts and details that would establish a 16 reason to draw a - 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: There are a lot of contact 18 lens solutions in the world. So if I heard that, 10 19 people went blind, 3 used it in one eye, 3 went blind in 20 that eye, I'd stop using the product; and if I were 21 holding stock in that company, I'd sell the stock. 22 MR. HACKER: The problem is -- I mean, there 23 has to be some reliable basis. You may be describing 24 facts that would satisfy the Bradford-Hill criteria, for 25 example, where you can draw a -- a reliable inference
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that the product is the cause. That's the key here. 2 There has to be - 3 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So - 4 MR. HACKER: -- a reliable basis for 5 inferring causation. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: This is the same kind of 7 question, but suppose I don't really know how drug 8 companies operate. I suspect, but I don't know, that 9 where you have a serious drug, people are hurt all the 10 time and they blame the drug. So probably drug 11 companies operate in an environment where they get all 12 kinds of complaints and some are valid, some are not; 13 who knows? People are frightened. 14 MR. HACKER: Very much so. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, I don't know 16 that. But you say at the beginning your client says: 17 Look, we get complaints all the time; you know, just put 18 up with it if you buy our stock. Now, I don't know to 19 what extent that's true. I don't know how that fits in. 20 I don't know whether their complaint is unusual or not 21 unusual or general. 22 Who is supposed to decide that? The judge 23 at the complaint stage? Or the judge after you get some 24 evidence on it? Or the jury? And the same is true of 25 scienter, after all, because the scienter, you see -
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and you have to plead that with particularity. Okay. 2 What's my -- what's your answer? What's the -- what's 3 -- I mean, Justice Kagan has an interesting view of 4 this, and could be, that she's putting forward and 5 others might have a different view. Who is to decide 6 this? 7 MR. HACKER: Well, ultimately it's a 8 question -- it would go all the way to the jury if the 9 plaintiffs were able to plead facts in the complaint 10 that entitled them to relief. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, we don't know. You 12 see, what they're saying is we have one respectable 13 doctor, studier, at -- you know, in Colorado. He, by 14 the way, has an abstract which isn't in the complaint, 15 which says that they do allege that it's zinc that's the 16 problem, a free zinc ion. And they say we also have 25 17 people who were hurt and some burning sensations in 18 people where it didn't rise to that level. 19 You know, I don't know. I don't know if 20 that's within the range of expectation of drug companies 21 as part of the normal course of business which investors 22 should know about, and I suspect a district judge 23 doesn't know, either. So how does it work where we in 24 fact just don't know whether this does or not arise 25 above the background noise of a drug company?

1 MR. HACKER: We think the answer is 2 statistical significance, just like the Second Circuit 3 said in Carter-Wallace - 4 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, it can't be. I 5 mean, all right -- I'm sorry. I don't mean to take a 6 position yet. But - 7 (Laughter.) 8 JUSTICE BREYER: But, look -- I mean, Albert 9 Einstein had the theory of relativity without any 10 empirical evidence, okay? So we could get the greatest 11 doctor in the world, and he has dozens of theories, and 12 the theories are very sound, and all that fits in here 13 is an allegation he now has learned that it's the free 14 zinc ion that counts. 15 MR. HACKER: But - 16 JUSTICE BREYER: And that could be 17 devastating to a drug even though there isn't one person 18 yet who has been hurt. So I don't see how we can say - 19 MR. HACKER: But -- but - 20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- this statistical 21 significance always works or always doesn't work. 22 MR. HACKER: But, Your Honor, out of 23 millions of uses, if there was that problem, you would 24 -- it wouldn't be hard to plead a case that says there's 25 a statistically significant problem -

1 JUSTICE BREYER: They did. They said - 2 they said the free zinc ion was -- that word on this was 3 told to your client by a person who knows a lot about 4 it, is apparently reputable, and was told to a person 5 who also knows a lot about it. Huh. I think they're 6 saying you ought to have been very nervous at that 7 point. That isn't just a usual background noise, okay? 8 So I'm back to my question, which is -- you can answer 9 the other one too if you like. But, I mean -- but my 10 question is: Who is supposed to decide, how? 11 MR. HACKER: Well, I think a plaintiff -- I 12 mean, I may just be repeating myself, but a plaintiff 13 has to plead the facts that would entitle them to relief 14 at the end of the day. So, I'm not saying a judge 15 always - 16 JUSTICE BREYER: I know, and we're back at 17 my question - 18 MR. HACKER: And - 19 JUSTICE BREYER: The question is: The facts 20 that are pleaded is -- I think it's assumed that this is 21 above the normal background noise -- they certainly 22 argue that at length -- that there was this free zinc 23 ion conversation, that there are 25 people who were 24 hurt, and there is a lot of burning sensation going on, 25 even though it doesn't rise to the level of people being

Now, they're 5 saying that's above the background noise, and you say, 6 no, it isn't. Now, who decides and how do we decide? 7 Don't we have to go to a trial? 8 MR. HACKER: The answer is no, Your Honor, 9 because there's no basis on those pleaded facts for 10 inferring that there's actually a problem with the zinc 11 ion - 12 JUSTICE BREYER: I know.

HACKER: But it matters what a scientist 20 would think because it's only then that anybody ex ante, 21 again, remember - 22 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, then what - 23 MR. HACKER: -- has a basis for inferring 24 that there's a causal link which will create the 25 problem. And the zinc -- to be very clear, let's -- to

1 be very clear about the zinc studies, the claim made on 2 the telephone wasn't even a claim of causation. It 3 said, are you aware of the zinc sulfate studies, which, 4 of course, is a fundamentally different compound 5 than zinc gluconate. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: No, because the sulfate - 7 you see in the abstract, which they didn't put in the 8 complaint, that the problem that they saw arising out of 9 the zinc sulfate studies was the free zinc ion. 10 MR. HACKER: No, the zinc sulfate studies 11 were polio related - 12 JUSTICE BREYER: I - 13 MR. HACKER: -- totally irrelevant. What 14 they cited for the free zinc ions were studies of 15 catfish and turtles. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: All right - 17 MR. HACKER: And nobody thinks, nobody 18 thinks, that you can infer anything from a study of 19 catfish and turtles about their smell sensation and 20 human beings - 21 JUSTICE BREYER: The trouble is, you know, 22 the truth is I don't know - 23 MR.

1 MR. HACKER: Well, in terms of scienter, 2 under the securities law there has to be a plausible 3 basis, and - 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I -- you got 5 cert granted on a limited question, and the limited 6 question was whether, in a complaint that alleges only 7 adverse reports, can you prove materiality and scienter 8 without proving statistical importance. That's the 9 question presented. 10 Justice Kagan started with the point that 11 the FDA doesn't require that. It requires just 12 reasonable evidence of a connection, not statistical. 13 Many of the amici here have done a wonderful job of 14 explaining why statistical importance can't be a measure 15 because it depends on the nature of the study at issue. 16 So given all of that -- and even in your 17 brief, in a footnote, you answered the question by 18 saying no, we can't establish that rule as an absolute, 19 because there are additional factors that could prove 20 materiality and scienter. So you've already answered 21 the question presented. 22 Are we down to what Justice Scalia asked 23 you, which is: We've got a "no" to the question: Are 24 the facts in this case enough? I don't know why we 25 would have granted cert on that, but you presented a
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 different question presented. Given the question 2 presented, is the answer no? And if not, why not? 3 MR. HACKER: Let me -- let me start with the 4 premise of the question presented. It's presented on 5 the facts as the case had been litigated today, trying 6 to rely on adverse event reports, which is 7 understandable. The plaintiffs don't want to have to 8 prove all of the other -- you wouldn't think they'd want 9 to prove all of the other facts. 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I just interrupt a 11 second? 12 MR. HACKER: Sure. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This wasn't an FDA 14 approved drug. 15 MR. HACKER: Right. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there weren't any 17 adverse reports in the legal sense of that word. 18 MR. HACKER: In the FDA sense, that's true. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the FDA sense. So 20 we're using a misnomer here to start with. 21 MR. HACKER: Well - 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Continue. 23 MR. HACKER: I would just say that adverse 24 event reports are not limited to what qualifies for the 25 FDA, certainly not by the way the case is -

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, if I may 2 interject - 3 MR. HACKER: -- litigated. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the FDA acts in the 5 public interest, doesn't it? 6 MR. HACKER: Yes. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it doesn't make money 8 by withdrawing a drug from the market. 9 MR. HACKER: Yes. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: As opposed to somebody who 11 sues, who makes money on the lawsuit. 12 MR. HACKER: That's true. But there's a 13 broader point about the FDA, which I think is underlying 14 your question and Justice Kagan's question, which is I 15 don't even think it's true that the FDA really requires 16 reasonable evidence. They have broad discretion and 17 should have broad discretion. Nobody is contesting 18 that. But the question is, again, ex ante, before you 19 know what the FDA might do, before there's sufficient 20 evidence to justify the FDA to act. Remember, the FDA 21 didn't act for 5 years. The FDA didn't act on the basis 22 of what Matrixx was aware of at the time, and so that 23 can't be the standard, the idea that the FDA may some 24 day act. 25 Statistical significance -- the question of
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 statistical significance is presented in this case to 2 the extent the courts below were arguing about and the 3 plaintiffs were arguing about whether or not the small 4 number of raw adverse event reports tell you anything 5 meaningful. The real standard -- the -- the case got 6 developed in the briefing here when the plaintiffs came 7 back and said, well, there's more to it and there can be 8 more to it, and that, of course, is true, but the 9 standard has to be reliability. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, but you -- you have 11 said raw adverse event reports. Am I not right that all 12 of these reports came from medical doctors, and in 13 response to the very first one, the company 14 representative said, yes, we've been getting reports 15 since 1999? 16 MR. HACKER: Well, there's a reference, but 17 -- I mean, there's a -- 1999 was the first call from 18 Dr. Hirsch, who reported one patient. There's a 19 discussion with Dr. Linschoten about one other patient. 20 And there were some reports -- nobody is disputing that 21 there were some reports out there. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But my question is, does 23 it make a difference if these reports come from medical 24 experts in this particular field? 25 MR. HACKER: No, because a doctor doesn't
29

1 have unique expertise in diagnosing causation. A 2 doctor -- if you have a sore knee, a doctor is qualified 3 to tell you -- to diagnose the fact that your sore knee 4 is the product of bone cancer. A doctor is not 5 qualified to tell you why you got bone cancer, and 6 that's the problem that we have here. 7 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 9 Mr. Hacker. 10 Mr. Frederick. 11 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK 12 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 13 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief 14 Justice, and may it please the Court: 15 In TSC and Basic, this Court reaffirmed the 16 longstanding rule that materiality is judged based on 17 the total mix of information available to investors. 18 Matrixx initially sought a major change to this Court's 19 contextual approach to materiality by offering a 20 bright-line standard of statistical significance. 21 In its reply brief, Matrixx offer -- offers 22 a rule that would apply only in the hypothetical 23 scenario where investors rely solely on numbers of 24 adverse event reports in pleading securities fraud. 25 This Court should reject both arguments in
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 this case. The broad theory has numerous legal and 2 policy flaws. First, the longstanding totality of the 3 circumstances test best comports with the varied reasons 4 why investors make investment decisions. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose the 6 allegations of materiality are based solely on adverse 7 event reports. Suppose that it's alleged that 10 8 million people during -- during -- during 1 year have 9 taken a particular drug and 5 people, shortly after 10 taking the drug, have developed certain -- have had an 11 adverse -- have had -- experienced an adverse event. Is 12 that sufficient to go to a jury? 13 MR. FREDERICK: Well, probably not 14 sufficient to go a jury absent a drop in the stock 15 price, absent evidence that there was a scientifically 16 plausible link, absent evidence that the product was 17 highly important to the company's long-term financial 18 prospects. All of these things go into the contextual 19 mix that investors would regard as important in making 20 an investment decision, and they all happen to be 21 present here. We - 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: If it was the only product 23 they sold, that might be enough -- 5 adverse reports out 24 of 10 million? If -- if that's the only product they 25 make, you say, totality of the circumstances, that may
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 be enough? 2 MR. FREDERICK: Under the Basic test, Your 3 Honor, that very well might if the probability and the 4 magnitude of the harm -- if those five incidents were 5 deaths from a product that was easily substitutable, 6 that might be a relevant decision and information that 7 investors might want to take into account. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In response to 9 Justice Alito, I heard you say something about a 10 scientifically plausible link. 11 MR. FREDERICK: Correct. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That seems to me to 13 be a rather significant concession. In other words, 14 you're saying it's not simply the fact that some psychic 15 would say something, that that is not sufficient, even 16 if that has an impact on the market price, that there 17 has to be some scientifically plausible link to the 18 report. 19 MR. FREDERICK: I think this goes back to 20 Justice Kennedy's question as well, Mr. Chief Justice, 21 because there could very well be materiality. The 22 information might be important for investors, but it 23 could very well be that the people making the 24 disclosures don't have the requisite scienter because 25 there is an absence of any plausible relationship.
32

1 The stock price might drop on news that 2 would not be regarded as news that the most highly 3 scientifically rational people would take into account. 4 But that - 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought this might 6 come up. At some point, do we look at scienter and then 7 go back from that to whether or not it's material, i.e., 8 the argument would be the company knew that this would 9 affect the price, and that's why they didn't disclose 10 it, and therefore that shows it's material? Or do we do 11 this with two isolated boxes -- one, materiality; two, 12 scienter -- and we don't mix the analyses? 13 MR. FREDERICK: They're both analytically 14 distinct and related, Justice Kennedy, and I don't have 15 a simple answer for you because many of the reported 16 cases raise issues of both materiality and scienter. 17 What the Court has said in Basic is that the test is the 18 total mix of information and whether that -- under that 19 total mix, the investor would find that information 20 important. In Tellabs, the Court said that whether or 21 not the inferences of scienter could be deemed -- were 22 as plausible as other inferences based on the mental 23 state of the people making the information. 24 So the Court has announced separate tests. 25 In a case like this, there is a natural overlap, and in
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 fact the other side has litigated this case on the basis 2 that no one would have thought within the company, based 3 on the adverse event reports, that there was a basis for 4 thinking there was information. 5 We plead the other way by saying that when 6 you have three medical specialists in three distinct 7 periods where the last wants to bring findings to the 8 leading ear, nose, and throat medical society suggesting 9 that, based on studies that go back as far back as the 10 1930s, there is a scientifically plausible link based on 11 the zinc ions, that's something that the company should 12 have taken seriously and disclosed to investors. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Frederick, suppose 14 you were the CEO of a pharmaceutical company with a new 15 drug, you've just put it out on the market, and you get 16 a report back, this drug has caused a death, right? 17 This is your first adverse effect report. Do you have 18 to disclose it? 19 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I guess the first 20 thing I would say is, if the drug has not been FDA 21 approved, that would be material information that 22 investors might want to know. If the drug had been FDA 23 approved and that report was then submitted to the FDA, 24 I think that there's a closer call depending on the, you 25 know, effect of the report that might be on the stock
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 price, because that's the only company product and the 2 other factors that we've mentioned in our brief. 3 I think the question of one event is 4 obviously much more difficult than where there are 5 multiple events submitted by doctors with a 6 scientifically plausible basis on a product that's 70 7 percent of the company's revenues. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, we're told that there 9 are hundreds of thousands of these, where for a -- for a 10 typical drug there may be thousands of these adverse 11 event reports in -- in a year, and you're -- basically, 12 you're saying all of those have to be disclosed? 13 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Alito, they already 14 are all disclosed. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: Well they -- already. So 16 then why does the company have to make additional 17 disclosure? 18 MR. FREDERICK: The - 19 JUSTICE ALITO: Analysts who follow the 20 stock price can easily look at the FDA Web site and see 21 the adverse event reports that have been reported - 22 MR. FREDERICK: Right. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: -- and draw whatever 24 conclusions seem to be warranted based on that. 25 MR. FREDERICK: That's why I think this case
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 presents the issue in a rather artificial way, because 2 the reports here were not the classic FDA-regulated 3 adverse event reports. This was a homeopathic drug that 4 was put on the market without FDA approval, and there 5 were no requirements of reports until 2006, which was 6 after the period at issue here. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: How would you write - 8 look, I'm asking how do you write this, because what - 9 where I think where the other side has a point is if - 10 with these -- this is a big class of these kinds of 11 things, you know, vitamins, all kinds of things like 12 that, and if we say that they have to disclose too much, 13 what will happen is people won't pay attention to it, 14 you know. 15 And if -- if you have, you know, 4,000 pages 16 of small print saying everything that was ever reported, 17 what really happens in -- in such instances is the 18 public pays no attention, and they think -- and it will 19 hide the things that are actually important. 20 So how would you write some words - 21 assuming that you're right, that their test is wrong - 22 but how would you write some words that will put a 23 disclosure obligation such that it's not going to be 24 overkill and it is going to get incidents that rise 25 above the background noise, and those are the incidents
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that are -- that would be significant for a reasonable 2 investor? 3 MR. FREDERICK: I would start with the 4 language in Basic, which says the total mix of 5 information is what has, long standing, been the test 6 for materiality under this Court's cases. I would say 7 that where there is credible medical professional 8 describing the harms based on credible scientific 9 theories to back up the link, a very serious health 10 effect risk for product with many substitutes, and the 11 effect is on a predominant product line, then the 12 company ought to disclose that information. I would 13 not - 14 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I'll go back and read 15 what you have just said, and -- I will, because it will 16 be in the transcript, and -- and the -- this case -- I 17 -- you are very good, your clients and the lawyers - 18 MR. FREDERICK: Right. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: -- at writing complaints. 20 All right? So they've alleged in this complaint 21 everything they can show, and I -- I suspect -- and 22 during the class period. And what it doesn't say is 23 that very helpful chart that you put in the brief, in 24 the pocket. It doesn't say they ever showed that to the 25 company. All it says is there was a phone call and this
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 individual from -- from Colorado said something, which 2 it doesn't specify, about zinc and the -- and the number 3 of deaths. 4 MR. FREDERICK: Well, in 1999, though, 5 Justice Breyer, Dr. Hirsch -- and this is outlined at 6 paragraph 25 of the complaint -- also said that 7 intranasal application of zinc could be problematic, and 8 he specifically asked about how much zinc is put in 9 Zicam precisely because of his awareness of prior 10 studies going all the way back to the polio period in 11 which zinc had created a problem of persistent anosmia. 12 But our submission here is that - 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How was your -- that 14 long litany of factors that you mentioned a few minutes 15 ago about how a company will go about determining 16 whether an adverse event report is material or not or 17 should be disclosed or not -- are you saying that 18 companies don't have to respond to irrational securities 19 holders? Are you accepting your adversary's proposition 20 that on some level -- you said credible evidence -- that 21 they don't have to respond to things they judge are not 22 credible? 23 MR. FREDERICK: It really depends, Justice 24 Sotomayor, and I don't mean to be evasive, but if there 25 is a product, say, that has some link to satanic
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 influences, and there is some reason to think that a 2 large body of followers in an irrational way might 3 regard there to be satanic influences on the basis of a 4 particular product, a cautious, reasonably prudent 5 investor might want to know that on the basis of that 6 information that most of us would regard as irrational, 7 might affect the stock price. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what protection 9 is there at the summary judgment stage in response to 10 allegations? Because it doesn't have to be 11 scientifically valid; it can be completely irrational. 12 All you have to do is allege that, you know, if you had 13 told this, the price would have gone down. If you had 14 told -- if you had disclosed this, the price would have 15 gone down. And the response from the company is, well, 16 but this is just ridiculous; this is some guy in his 17 garage who writes this out on -- on a -- you know, a 18 piece of paper in -- in handwriting. And the response 19 is going to be, well, let's let the jury sort it out. 20 MR. FREDERICK: There are two answers, Mr. 21 Chief Justice. One is, in Basic itself, the Court 22 talked about the actions of a reasonable investor, and 23 this Court and many courts have always looked at a 24 reasonable person standard in making all sorts of these 25 fine judgments about the importance of particular
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 information. But the second answer is - 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you just told 3 me that it would be enough if somebody says that there's 4 a satanic, you know, impact on this, because a 5 reasonable investor would say there are enough crazy 6 people out there that this is going to affect the price. 7 MR. FREDERICK: What I said was if the 8 product was one that might be, you know, attractive in 9 some way to people who had that particular following. I 10 think you have to link up the product with the nature of 11 the complaint and the effect of the importance of the 12 information. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it matters 14 whether -- I don't know what kind of product has 15 particular satanic susceptibility - 16 (Laughter.) 17 MR. FREDERICK: Well - 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but I mean, are 19 you saying it matters if it's something that -- that 20 Satan's not going to be interested in? I don't 21 understand. 22 (Laughter.) 23 MR. FREDERICK: You're - 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't mean to be 25 facetious, but your way of distinguishing the satanic
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 product is that it depends on whether people who follow 2 satanic cults are going to be interested or not. I 3 mean - 4 MR. FREDERICK: Well, Your Honor, there are 5 people who follow those things, and they spend money and 6 they buy stocks, but my second point is that scienter - 7 scienter is the other way around this problem, because 8 even though information - 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know that -- if 10 scienter is -- it seems to me ridiculous to -- to hold 11 companies to -- to irrational standards. And we did - 12 and we did say in -- in Basic that it's viewed - 13 whether it would be viewed by the reasonable investor. 14 And -- and you are saying, well, the reasonable investor 15 takes account of the irrationality. I don't think 16 that's what we meant in -- in Basic. 17 MR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Scalia, you 18 can certainly write as a prophylactic here that that 19 isn't part of this test. We certainly have here all of 20 the indicia of credible medical professionals on a 21 credible scientific theory on a product that was 22 important to the company's finances and a very serious 23 side effect for a drug that had ready substitutes. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So that -25 I'm just trying to get your response to that. You just
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 talked again about credible scientists and all that, and 2 you're putting those other things to one side. 3 So even if you have your satanic problem, 4 that is not enough. And you can sit there and allege it 5 would cause a drop of 30 percent in the stock price, and 6 you should have let this know -- your answer is no, they 7 don't have to let -- they don't have to disclose this 8 because there is no scientific credible basis for the 9 link that's alleged? 10 MR. FREDERICK: Now, I'm saying two things. 11 One is that there's a difference between scienter and 12 materiality. There is importance of information and an 13 intent to deceive, and the questions are analytically 14 distinct. In your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, I 15 think you merged them, and I'd like to keep them 16 separate because as we -- as this case comes to the 17 Court, the issue is what is the standard for materiality 18 and whether or not statistical significance is the only 19 way to - 20 JUSTICE ALITO: On materiality - 21 MR. FREDERICK: -- materiality. 22 JUSTICE ALITO: -- can I give you -- because 23 I'm having a little difficulty understanding the 24 boundaries of the argument that you're making. 25 Let me give two hypotheticals, and they both
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 involve companies that have one product, and this is 2 their one product. The first one was what I mentioned 3 before, and I wasn't -- I wasn't clear about your 4 answer. All that's alleged is that a very large number 5 of people took the drug and that three people, after 6 taking the drug, within a week developed a certain 7 syndrome. That's the first one. Is that enough for 8 materiality? 9 The second one is that a company receives a 10 telephone call: Hello, I'm a general practitioner from 11 wherever, and I treated a patient, and the patient took 12 your medication and shortly after that developed this 13 syndrome, and I think there might be a connection. Is 14 that enough for materiality? 15 MR. FREDERICK: On the second one, I would 16 say probably not. And I would say, on the first one, 17 there's not enough information about the side effect and 18 what the drug is intended to solve. 19 I mean, the probability/magnitude test as 20 articulated by this Court goes to the probability of the 21 effect versus the magnitude that would be perceived by 22 investors, and those are important factors they go into. 23 So your hypothetical is very difficult to answer as you 24 have framed it. 25 JUSTICE ALITO: All right. This drug, let's
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 say it's a drug to relieve the common cold, and the 2 effect is loss of the sense of smell. Five million 3 people take it. Three people, after taking it, lose 4 their sense of smell. Is that enough for materiality by 5 itself? 6 MR. FREDERICK: It -- by itself, that could 7 be enough, and the reason we know that could be enough, 8 Justice Alito, is that when, you know, some score 9 additional were released and this information was 10 disclosed, the stock price went down by 23.8 percent. 11 So reasonable - 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, your time 13 is running out, and there's one thing that you emphasize 14 in your brief -- I haven't heard you say one word about 15 it here -- and that is you're saying it's -- this is not 16 a case of a company that remains silent. The company, 17 in response to this, issued press releases in which it 18 said any suggestion of a linkage is completely 19 unfounded. Now, that's something different from there 20 are X number of reports. To what extent are you relying 21 on the affirmative statements that the company made? 22 MR. FREDERICK: We're relying on those to 23 establish scienter, both at the beginning of the class 24 period when they forced Dr. Jafek, through their legal 25 threats, to take Zicam off his poster presentation, and
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 then later when they said that the reports of anosmia 2 were completely unfounded and "misleading," was the word 3 that they used. "And misleading." And they repeated 4 that after the Good Morning America program came on, 5 only to say 3 weeks later, after empaneling a scientific 6 expert panel, that the information was insufficient to 7 make that determination. Our submission is that that is 8 enough. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Frederick, I'm -- I'm 10 not clear on why you can draw a distinction between 11 materiality and scienter for purposes of the issue 12 before us here. 13 If, indeed, satanic effect is enough for 14 materiality, you say, well, it may not be enough for 15 scienter. Why? I mean, if the company knows that 16 satanic effect is material, then the company has - 17 knowingly withholds it because it thinks satanic effect 18 is irrational, why doesn't that company have scienter, 19 if it's material? 20 The scienter is withholding something that 21 is material, that is known to be material, and once you 22 say that -- you know, that Satan is material, if the 23 company thinks Satan is involved here, it has to put it 24 in its report, no? 25 MR. FREDERICK: And it would depend on what
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 kind of stock effect occurred. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: So there's no difference 3 between the materiality issue and the scienter issue. 4 MR. FREDERICK: Well - 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't push this problem 6 off onto the scienter side of the equation. 7 MR. FREDERICK: It depends -- it depends on 8 this Court's application of its known precedent, which 9 my colleague here has not even referenced in his opening 10 argument, Basic, which says you look at the total mix of 11 the information. And all of these things go into play. 12 If the - 13 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I get that. Can I 14 just ask you one question in response to -- just picking 15 up on the last -- what about the need for a, quote, 16 "strong inference of scienter," end quote, and does this 17 complaint show more than a borderline situation where it 18 doesn't strongly infer that the person intended to 19 mislead the defendant? What about that argument? 20 MR. FREDERICK: Well, we believe, and they 21 haven't argued that this complaint is not sufficient 22 under the PSLRA, which set the heightened pleading 23 standard for scienter that this Court articulated and 24 construed in the Tellabs decision, so we believe that 25 scienter is adequately pleaded here based on -

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, page 49 of their 2 brief -- they have two pages on it -- it does not give 3 rise to a strong inference of scienter. 4 MR. FREDERICK: What I'm saying is that 5 there's already a heightened pleading standard, Justice 6 Breyer. I was not -- I misunderstood your question to 7 say, is there some other heightened pleading standard 8 other than the one - 9 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I mean -- I just 10 want to know why -- if their inference on materiality is 11 enough to survive the background noise reply, is it 12 enough to show a strong inference that they did do this 13 intending to mislead, a strong inference of scienter? 14 MR. FREDERICK: The key aspects here are 15 their treatment of Jafek when Jafek was going to go 16 public with his scientifically linked claim of anosmia 17 from the Zicam, and then subsequently when they issued 18 press releases saying it would be completely unfounded 19 and misleading to assert any causal link. That is 20 sufficient to establish a strong inference of scienter. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 22 Frederick. 23 Mr. Shah. 24 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 2 MR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 3 please the Court: 4 For 35 years, this Court's precedents have 5 instructed that information is material for securities 6 fraud purposes if a reasonable investor would have 7 viewed it as having meaningfully altered the total mix 8 of information. Under the terms of their question 9 presented, Petitioners propose to depart from that 10 contextual inquiry in favor of a categorical rule that 11 deems information about an adverse drug effect 12 immaterial absent statistical significance. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shah, what do you 14 think - 15 MR. SHAH: To the extent - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you think about 17 Satan? 18 (Laughter.) 19 MR. SHAH: Let me try to unpack the satanic 20 connection hypotheticals a little bit. 21 Now, to be sure, if someone just called a 22 company and said, hey, I think you guys are affiliated 23 with satanic practices, surely a company would not have 24 to go and disclose that to all the investors. But this 25 is going to depend on what the actual reality is and
48

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 what the company's statements have been. 2 Now, if the company has made a statement 3 that, look, consumer confidence in our products is at an 4 all-time high and we expect sales to double in the next 5 quarter, and yet they are aware that there -- a consumer 6 boycott is being planned by, let's say, 10 percent of 7 their consumer base premised on the irrational notion 8 that their company is tied to Satan, then certainly, to 9 correct their affirmative representation that consumer 10 confidence is at an all-time high and that they expect 11 their sales to double, a reasonable investor would want 12 to know that - 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: They haven't said that. 14 They haven't said our sales are going to double. 15 They're just rocking along at normal sales. 16 MR. SHAH: Right. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: And they find out that 18 10 percent of nutty-nuttys out there are not going to 19 buy their stuff because of Satan. Okay? 20 MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor - 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about that? 22 MR. SHAH: In that hypothetical, it depends 23 on what affirmative statements the companies have made. 24 Under the securities law -- and this is an important 25 point that I don't think has come through yet. Under
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the securities laws, there is no baseline duty to 2 disclose for a manufacturer or a company. A company 3 creates a duty to disclose once they have spoken. So 4 it's going to depend on what the company has said. 5 Now, in your scenario, if a company has made 6 statements projecting their company's success into the 7 next quarter, for example, and they have a concrete 8 basis to know that, as your hypothetical submits, 9 10 percent of their computer -- consumer base is going 10 to leave the company's products, that is almost 11 certainly going to be material to an investor, and so, 12 yes, they would have to disclose that we have reason to 13 believe, however ridiculous it is and untrue it is, that 14 10 percent of our consumer base has decided to boycott 15 our product. That's certainly reasonable. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would have - 17 you just said they would have a duty to disclose. 18 MR. SHAH: Yes, sir. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you 20 earlier just said there's no affirmative duty to 21 disclose; it only is based on what they say. 22 MR. SHAH: It's based on what they said. 23 So, for example, if the company had simply remained 24 silent - 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.
50
Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. SHAH: -- and not said anything about 2 its future sales, its prospects, then under the 3 securities laws there is no duty to disclose. Basic and 4 other cases have long made clear that there has to be 5 something to trigger a duty to disclose. That is, under 6 Rule 10b-5 it's only statements that are rendered 7 misleading by the omission of a material fact that can 8 trigger liability. If there is no projection about the 9 company's future success, then it wouldn't have to 10 disclose in that situation. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the company makes 12 the kind of relatively common statements that were made 13 here, poised for growth in the upcoming season, very 14 strong momentum going into the season, extremely well 15 positioned for a successful season? 16 MR. SHAH: Sure, Your Honor - 17 JUSTICE ALITO: That's -- that triggers the 18 duty to disclose the satanic rumors? 19 MR. SHAH: In certain cases where there are 20 very generalized statements -- for example, we think our 21 product will do well -- that may close -- come close to 22 the line of puffery that is a non-actionable statement 23 that no reasonable investor would rely on. Petitioners 24 have never pressed that argument before this Court. 25 There is no dispute about whether the statements that
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Matrixx made in this case are actionable, even though I 2 agree with you that some of them probably come close to 3 that puffery line. 4 Here, though, we don't just have those 5 statements about the company being well positioned for 6 future growth. There are additional statements, and 7 these were made to stock analysts that they expected a 8 50 percent increase in annual revenues, and, of course, 9 there are the much more affirmative statements that the 10 drug's safety had been well established and that the 11 rumor -- the reports of anosmia were completely 12 unfounded and misleading. Those statements certainly 13 crossed the line. And as I said before, there hasn't 14 been an argument in this case as to whether those less 15 specific and arguably puffery-type statements - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the Government's 17 position is that reports of adverse effects that have no 18 scientific basis, so long as they would affect 19 irrationally consumers, have to be disclosed, assuming 20 the company has said we're doing well, right? 21 MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, yes, I think it 22 would depend, again, on the statements the company 23 makes. If -- if - 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, if Satan 25 comes in, surely lousy science comes in as well, no?
52

1 MR. SHAH: Okay. So -- so, for example, 2 if a company had been faced with a potential adverse 3 effect and it had assembled a blue-ribbon panel of 4 scientists, conclusively determined that there is no 5 causal connection between this purported adverse effect 6 and their drug, the question is, would they have to 7 disclose in that circumstance? 8 I think if the company had simply made 9 statements relating to the drug safety -- we think our 10 drug is safe; there's no reason to believe that it 11 causes any adverse effects -- then the answer is no, 12 because the reported adverse effect would not call into 13 question the accuracy of the company's statements 14 relating to the safety of the drug. 15 If, however, the company had made specific 16 statements relating to consumer demand for its products 17 and it knew -- notwithstanding the fact that there was 18 no causal connection, it knew or had good reason to 19 believe that a significant portion of its consumer base 20 would avoid the product, then, yes, a reasonable 21 investor would want to know that information, and under 22 Basic the company would have a duty to disclose that, 23 even though unfounded, these reports may lead a 24 significant percentage of our consumer base to leave the 25 product.

1 I think that falls squarely within the 2 definition of materiality, which is would a reasonable 3 investor want to have known that information? 4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Shah, what deference do 5 you think that the SEC's understanding of materiality is 6 entitled to and why? 7 MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, this Court in 8 both TSC and Basic accorded what it called due deference 9 to the SEC's views on the application of the materiality 10 standard. I think it's certainly true -- and -- and 11 those, by the way, were both -- the -- the Court was 12 deferring to the views of the SEC as expressed in amicus 13 briefs to the Court just like in this case. 14 I think the SEC is due a significant 15 deference based upon, one, its longstanding historical 16 practice in applying the materiality standard, which is 17 part of its own rule, Rule 10b-5, and its special 18 expertise in knowing what a reasonable investor would 19 want to know based upon its experience in this area. 20 So, I do think that, to the extent there is any 21 ambiguity remaining in this case, the Court should defer 22 to the SEC's views. 23 And back to Justice Breyer's questions about 24 what should the Court write simply beyond reiterating 25 the Basic standard, I think what the Court did in Basic
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 was it not only articulated the general standard, but it 2 laid out some factors. And in laying out those factors, 3 that's where the Court deferred to the SEC's brief. And 4 it laid out factors that a reasonable investor might 5 find relevant. In that case, it was the merger context. 6 And here, on page 28 of our brief, we lay 7 out several factors that we think bear on the 8 materiality question in this particular context; that 9 is, involving adverse drug information. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any way 11 that consideration of those factors would support a -- a 12 summary judgment in favor of the pharmaceutical 13 manufacturer, other than the fact of having an extremely 14 poor lawyer drafting a complaint? Anytime you have a 15 variety of factors like that - 16 MR. SHAH: Sure. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- I think it's very 18 difficult for the judge to say anything other than 19 that's for the jury. 20 MR. SHAH: If you mean at the motion to 21 dismiss stage, Mr. Chief Justice - 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 23 MR. SHAH: I think there would be some 24 cases. And, in fact, we know there are dozens of 25 12(b)(6) motions granted in securities fraud cases, and
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 let me lay out a few scenarios for you. 2 One would be in the -- in the scenario where 3 the company has not made any actionable statements. It 4 has either -- statements to predicate a duty to 5 disclose. It either has been made - 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, I'm talking 7 about -- I'm talking about materiality. In other 8 words - 9 MR. SHAH: Sure. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- based solely on 11 -- in other words, you're saying if they say anything 12 related, it's going to be enough - 13 MR. SHAH: Sure. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- whether it's a 15 scientific basis or not. 16 MR. SHAH: Sure. Two responses to that. 17 One, the PSLRA does have a safe harbor for companies 18 once they make forward-looking statements, that if they 19 add in meaningful cautionary language -- and this is in 20 the PSLRA itself, section 5(c)(1)(A) -- that if they add 21 in meaningful cautionary statements, then they cannot be 22 subject to liability. And I think there are a couple 23 other scenarios that would -- would trigger, for 24 example, if the product at issue is such a small 25 percentage of the company's income or expected growth

1 that no reasonable investor would care if it tanked, 2 then that might be a circumstance where a motion to 3 dismiss would be appropriate. 4 Thank you, Your Honor. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 6 Mr. Hacker, you have 3 minutes remaining. 7 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN HACKER 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. HACKER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 10 I'd like to return to Justice Kennedy's 11 question about the role of scienter here, which I think 12 absolutely is critical, as this Court emphasized 13 recently in the Merck v. Reynolds case. 14 Mr. Frederick correctly, I think, conceded 15 that there has to be a scientifically plausible basis. 16 And what you're talking about here is a company's 17 knowledge of a scientifically plausible basis. And he 18 has to make that concession in this case because of 19 what's alleged to be the material omission. 20 The material omission is not knowledge of 21 dubious scientific -- medical claims. It's not that we 22 got one phone call from a doctor. The real material 23 omission is that the adverse event reports told Matrixx 24 that Zicam causes anosmia. That's ultimately the fact 25 that -- that Matrixx supposedly did not disclose. And
57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 so there has to be a basis for believing that -- there 2 has to be allegation in the complaint that's sufficient 3 to establish that Matrixx actually knew that Zicam 4 causes anosmia and yet willfully refused to tell 5 investors that fact. 6 And there's nothing in the complaint like 7 that. There's not -- you're not talking about a case 8 where there was a failure to disclose the doctor's 9 completely dubious untested claim. It's not a case - 10 it's not the Satan case where you're talking about a 11 media splash, a known fact that there's going to be a 12 major media splash, and the company knows for a fact 13 that that splash is going to have the adverse effect on 14 the stock. There's not even a claim here - 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As I was hearing the 16 Solicitor General's argument, he wasn't actually even 17 talking about causation. He was talking about a 18 statement you made about the company poised to double 19 its growth. And I think he was saying that on the basis 20 of what you had heard up until that time, you had to 21 have known that that statement was misleading, as was 22 the statement that this drug -- that there was 23 absolutely no proof or connection of causation, which 24 was your scientific panel said you couldn't make that 25 extreme statement.
58

1 MR. HACKER: Well, two points, Your Honor. 2 First, if the claim was about, you know, the consumer 3 sales, you would need an allegation in the case that 4 consumer product sales were actually affected. There's 5 no allegation like that, and the truth is they weren't. 6 And so you're not talking about falsifying any prior 7 claim. There's not even an allegation that that 8 happened, Your Honor. 9 And, second, with respect to the -- the 10 statement, as I was discussing with Justice Ginsburg in 11 the beginning part of the argument, the statement was - 12 what the scientific panel was addressing primarily was 13 Jafek's claim that Zicam causes anosmia, and the company 14 said accurately that that is completely unfounded and 15 misleading because there's no scientific support for it. 16 You can't go out and claim that Zicam causes anosmia 17 unless you have a scientific basis for that. And the 18 scientific panel was saying that isn't true. 19 So the question is whether you can draw an 20 inference of scienter from the fact that -- from what's 21 alleged here, and there's simply no basis for an 22 allegation, supportable allegation, that the company 23 knew it causes anosmia and nevertheless refused to tell 24 investors that. Thank you. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
