3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Case 141132, Merrill Lynch,

5 Pierce, Fenner & Smith v. Manning.

6             Mr. Hacker.

7            ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN D. HACKER

8               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9             MR. HACKER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11             In language that differs distinctly from the

12 "arising under" language of Section 1331, Exchange Act

13 Section 27 confers on the Federal courts exclusive

14 jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty

15 created by the Exchange Act and its regulations.  That

16 language establishes a straightforward test.

17             The Federal court has exclusive jurisdiction

18 if the suit is brought to enforce Exchange Act duties

19 even if the suit is also brought to enforce State law

20 duties.

21             In particular, the words "brought to

22 enforce" focus on what the plaintiff itself wants the

23 court to decide, not on what the court would necessarily

24 have to decide, as 1331 has been read to require.

25             By applying the 1331 test, the Third Circuit

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
4 1 not only ignored Section 27's distinct language but also 2 its distinct policies, which strongly disfavor State 3 court adjudication of Exchange Act duties and thus are 4 exactly the opposite of the policies favoring State 5 court adjudication that underlie the Jackson Pollock 6 canvas this Court has painted over Section 1331. 7             Respondents, however, begin not with the 8 necessity rule derived from 1331 but with a much more 9 aggressive position that Section 27 only creates 10 jurisdiction over causes of action created by the 11 Exchange Act itself and thus categorically bars 12 jurisdiction over Statebased causes of action like 13 those asserted here. 14             JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, does your  does your 15 test depend solely on what is alleged in the complaint 16 or what might be proven under a  a more generally 17 worded complaint? 18             Suppose the complaint in this case made no 19 reference to any Federal regulations but  I'm not that 20 familiar with the pleading rules in New Jersey, but 21 suppose they would  it was, you know, notice pleading 22 and so there's no reference to the regulations but 23 they  they sought to prove their case by arguing that 24 the New Jersey  the New  the rule in New Jersey 25 should be the same as the Federal regulation.  Would
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that fall within your test?

5

2             MR. HACKER:  The way you put it at the very

3 end, the answer is no.  If the rule in New Jersey is the

4 same because it's the rule in New Jersey, then that

5 would not be seeking to enforce an Exchange Act duty.

6             The answer to the first part of your

7 question is yes, which is our test does look at the

8 allegations on the face of the complaint:  Is the

9 complaint as pleaded seeking to enforce a duty created

10 by the Exchange Act?

11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So they could amend the

12 complaint, and then we wouldn't be here, because they

13 could amend the complaint to say that we're suing under

14 New Jersey law and New Jersey law mirrors the Federal

15 law.  It's a matter of New Jersey's choice.

16             MR. HACKER:  The way I would put it is we

17 wouldn't have been here if they had written that

18 complaint to start with, but because removal 

19 jurisdiction is tested at the time of removal, if they

20 amended their complaint now, it wouldn't change the fact

21 that there's Federal jurisdiction based on the face of

22 the complaint at the time of the  of removal.

23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, is the Court

24 obligated to do a search of all Federal laws and

25 regulations to know if this complaint might have a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Federal cause of action?

6

2             MR. HACKER:  No.  That's why it's important

3 to look at the face of the complaint.  This complaint

4 exemplifies the kind of complaint that triggers

5 Section 27 jurisdiction because it's 

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But what you said 

7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let  let me ask you:

8 This  this  this  let's assume, as Justice Alito

9 assumed, that New Jersey is the same as the Federal

10 system, notice pleading.  Can you just tell me as a

11 matter of practice, do most complaints set forth the

12 Federal statute under which  not 1331 but the specific

13 Federal statute that creates the duty, or do they just

14 allege the duty?

15             MR. HACKER:  Most complaints  sure.  It

16 depends on the jurisdiction.  But certainly in my 

17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let's say just under

18 notice pleading under Federal standards.

19             MR. HACKER:  They would almost certainly set

20 forth the  the statute under which they're pleading.

21 They're identifying the duty so that the Court

22 understands what the nature of the claim is.  That's

23 very common precisely because you don't want the Court

24 to go looking around for the cause of action, especially

25 after Twombly and Iqbal.

Alderson Reporting Company

7 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But they  but they don't 2 have to do that.  As  as I understand your case, they 3 don't have to explicitly refer to the Federal statute. 4             MR. HACKER:  That's  that's right in a 5 limited sense that  I think this Court would recognize 6 and has recognized inartful pleading doctrine where, for 7 example  if you use this complaint as an example, if 8 they had just literally whited out, deleted the 9 references to Reg SHO as such but were clearly 10 unambiguously pleading violations of its requirements 11 with the same capital L, Locate, capital C, CloseOut 12 requirements, you would unmistakably understand the 13 complaint to be based on violations of the Act  of the 14 Exchange Act regulation seeking to enforce those duties. 15 Then sure, the fact you didn't cite it wouldn't change 16 the fact. 17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that imposes quite 18 a  quite an onerous task upon  upon the Federal 19 district court, it seems to me.  You  you have to sift 20 through the complaint and see if any of the claimed 21 causes of action under State law mirror a cause of 22 action that happens to exist under Federal law, without 23 even the hint that they mention the Federal statute. 24             MR. HACKER:  Well, but that  that only 25 goes to the question in an artful pleading situation,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 which in this case doesn't present, and would be, you

8

2 know, the next third, fourth, fifth case down the road.

3             But certainly in  in  the defendant, you

4 know, who moves or seeks jurisdiction, the party seeking

5 to establish jurisdiction, would have to identify for

6 the court the defendant's theory as to why the complaint

7 seeks to enforce Federal duty.  So it's not like the

8 judge has to do it him or herself.

9             But all of these are hypothetical questions.

10 We're talking about a complaint here that unambiguously

11 seeks to enforce duties prescribed 

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I just don't understand

13 how.

14             MR. HACKER:   about regulation 

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Meaning under Pan Am, we

16 looked at the operative paragraphs of the complaint, not

17 the general pleadings or background.  We looked at what

18 remedies were sought to determine whether you were

19 looking to enforce the law.  Each of the causes of

20 action here are under State law.  How is that seeking

21 redress under Federal law?

22             MR. HACKER:  A  a couple of points.  First

23 of all, Pan Am was a wellpleaded complaintrule case.

24 The Federal issue didn't appear on the face of the

25 complaint, so this Court, correctly applying the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 an  uncontroversial applying the wellpleaded

9

2 complaint rule, read the complaint, took it for what it

3 said 

4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, it looked at the

5 operative paragraphs.  Why should 

6             MR. HACKER:  Right.  So 

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The operative paragraphs

8 here are the causes of action.

9             MR. HACKER:  But then turning to this

10 complaint, the  the  the court looks at the causes

11 of action, each of which obviously incorporates,

12 explicitly incorporates all of the prior conduct alleged

13 as the basis for the violation of the cause of action

14 and the  the prior allegations and the causes of

15 action themselves.

16             The causes of action themselves are all

17 about what the complaint  the Respondents describe as

18 illegal shortselling.  That's what causes  that's

19 what makes unjustment enrich.  That's what makes the

20 interference of contract tortious.  That's what makes 

21 it's negligent.  That's the breach of the duty, is to 

22 is to  is to do  find a Locate.

23             So where in the complaint you find 

24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Without the Federal law,

25 would there be a duty under State law not to short sell?

10 1             MR. HACKER:  Not under this complaint.  The 2 complaint identifies  3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Please go back to answer 4 my direct question:  If there were no Federal law. 5             MR. HACKER:  There is  the answer is no. 6 The Third Circuit itself said there is no analogue under 7 New Jersey law to Regulation SHO.  Nothing.  Zero in 8 New Jersey law.  Not a statute, not a regulation, not an 9 administrative guidance, and not a common law  10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, New Jersey  11 New Jersey law certainly prohibits fraud.  So is  are 12 they doing anything more than saying, we think this 13 constitutes fraud? 14             MR. HACKER:  They  they're saying  15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  "This" being what 16 the  the violation  what you say is the violation of 17 the Federal law. 18             MR. HACKER:  Right.  What they're saying is 19 fraud or is tortious interference or is negligence or is 20 unjust enrichment is the failure to get a Locate. 21             The complaint isn't ambiguous about this. 22 The complaint explains what a Locate is.  It's 23 prescribed by Regulation SHO. 24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So do they just have 25 to expand their allegation and say, okay, we're not
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 going to call it "a Locate," but we think it's fraud

11

2 when you're, you know, shortselling this and you're

3 supposed to have  and you haven't borrowed this much,

4 blah, blah, blah?  In other words, just creating a

5 parallel duty  which I understood you to tell Justice

6 Alito that would be okay.  Instead, they're using a

7 shorthand, "the Locate."  Is that  is that all the 

8 the only difference?

9             MR. HACKER:  Well, they're  they're

10 definitely not just using a  a shorthand.  They're

11 very explicit about it in defining "Locate," capital L.

12 That is the gravamen.  To use the phrase from this

13 morning's decision, that is the  no matter how

14 packaged, that is the gravamen of the suit here, is a

15 complaint about failure to get Locates, which is

16 compensation.

17             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then why isn't this just

18 like 

19             MR. HACKER:  But 

20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There are  there are

21 many, many instances in which there is a State claim,

22 say a State claim for negligence, and the negligent

23 conduct is alleged to be violation of a Federal safety

24 standard.  So it's all about whether the Federal safety

25 standard was violated, but the claim is a State claim

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
12 1 for negligence.  You wouldn't say that that is a claim 2 that has to be brought in Federal court. 3             MR. HACKER:  Well  but the language of 4 this statute is different.  That's the key.  In this 5 Court's Moore decision addressing "arising under," under 6 1331, the Court addressed exactly that situation.  It 7 was precisely that situation.  The State of Kentucky 8 made it negligence per se to violate the Safety 9 Appliances Act, and this Court says  and it used the 10 exact phrasing that became Section 27 when it said, the 11 State negligence per se statute incorporated the duty 12 prescribed by the State.  We're seeking to enforce the 13 duty prescribed in the Act. 14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So in your  in your 15 view, you have to  if  if  if this Court finds 16 that the section here, Section 27, is the same as 17 "arising under," you lose? 18             MR. HACKER:  Well, no, but for a different 19 reason.  We do think it's actually necessary and the 20 Third Circuit erred in that respect, but that's not the 21 question here.  The question here  and we think it's 22 perfectly clear that the complaint actually  they 23 can't prevail under State law unless they establish that 24 Reg SHO was violated. 25             But  but our point is 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm sorry.  Can we go

13

2 back?  Because I'm not sure I understood your answer to

3 my question.  Are you saying that if a State adopts a

4 violation of a Federal safety standard as constituting

5 negligence, that that claim arises under Federal law?

6             MR. HACKER:  Not that it arises under

7 Federal law, but that a suit under that State's standard

8 says it is a violation of State law to violate Reg

9 SHO  for example, if New Jersey law said it is a

10 violation, it is a  you know, the statutory tort to

11 violate Reg SHO, if that was the statute, and you

12 brought a suit under that statute, you were  and it

13 was seeking to enforce the duties created by Reg SHO.

14 That's why this language is different from "arising

15 under," because the suit was clearly 

16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But what's the answer to

17 Justice Ginsburg's question?

18             MR. HACKER:  It would not necessarily be 

19 it would be  only be a suit "arising under" if it was

20 necessary, but under this language, it would be a

21 Federal court action because that suit would be a suit

22 seeking to  brought to enforce duties created by Reg

23 SHO.

24             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't understand.

25 Necessary for what?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. HACKER:  I'm sorry?

14

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You said that it would be

3 only a suit if it were  Federal suit if it were

4 necessary.

5             MR. HACKER:  I'm sorry.  It would only be an

6 arising under action under 1331.  That would be 

7 that's a different statute, a different jurisdictional

8 statute.  Under that statute  to be clear, that's not

9 the one we're talking about.  Under 1331, this Court has

10 held, since at least the Smith case, that a State  an

11 action brought under State law can be in State court,

12 even if it's a State cause of action, if resolving a

13 Federal issue is necessary to resolve the State cause of

14 action.  That's 1331.

15             This statute is markedly and meaningfully

16 different because it doesn't turn on whether it's

17 arising under what the cause of action is.  What it

18 turns on is what was the suit brought to enforce.  It

19 was brought to enforce a duty brought by the Exchange

20 Act.

21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Hacker, just looking at

22 the language, I mean, I understand your interpretation

23 of it, but it seems to me that there's, you know, a 

24 just as good interpretation which says the opposite.  In

25 other words, you know, what does it mean for a suit to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 be brought to enforce a liability in a kind of

15

2 circumstance you're talking about?  In the circumstance

3 you're talking about, the suit is brought to enforce

4 State law.

5             Now, it's true that State law might look to

6 Federal law; State law might incorporate Federal law in

7 certain ways; State law might have some kind of

8 relationship to Federal law.  But what's the suit

9 brought to enforce?  The suit is brought to enforce

10 State law.

11             MR. HACKER:  A couple of points, though.

12 Remember, the statute doesn't say is the suit brought to

13 enforce State law.

14             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But State liabilities.

15             MR. HACKER:  It's also not said  said

16 brought to enforce State liabilities.  It says brought

17 to enforce State liability or  excuse me, brought to

18 enforce liabilities or duties created by the Act.

19             If it were liabilities alone, this might be

20 a different case, because the Exchange Act creates

21 liabilities by its own terms, and an action brought to

22 enforce Exchange Act liabilities, basically remedies 

23 would be, as I say, that might well be a case that

24 has  would only be brought under the Exchange Act.

25             But when they added the words "or duties,"

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
16 1 clearly they're addressing the same kind of problem that 2 this Court addressed in Moore when the States  it was 3 an emerging issue at the time  when States were 4 incorporating explicitly, not just generally looking to, 5 but explicitly incorporating Federal duties into State 6 law, and plaintiffs were bringing State causes of action 7 for negligence, saying that  8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you would say that's a 9 duty created under this chapter. 10             MR. HACKER:  Right, created  the Reg SHO 11 in this situation is a duty created  12             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But why isn't it created 13 under State law as well? 14             MR. HACKER:  Because the  the cause of 15 action is created in State law.  State law says it is a 16 violation of State law to violate a duty created by 17 Federal law.  State law doesn't, itself, care about the 18 content.  It's incorporating.  It's saying we leave to 19 the Congress, we leave to the SEC, whatever the 20 regulatory body is, the content of the law, and we just 21 say that you can have a cause of action under our State 22 procedures if you violate duties created by Federal law. 23 That's the situation. 24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think that's sort of 25 ambiguous in the statute.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
17 1             Let's assume you have a State statute and a 2 Federal statute, both of which impose the same duty. 3 Okay?  And someone brings a suit only under the State 4 statute; does not  does not even mention the Federal 5 statute. 6             As I understand your case, you would say 7 that that person is suing to enforce a duty under 8 Federal law.  I would not say that.  I would say that 9 person is seeking to enforce the duty that State law 10 creates, not the one that Federal law creates. 11             MR. HACKER:  And I agree with you.  Our 12 argument is not  if there are literally parallel State 13 duties, the State says if New Jersey tomorrow, or more 14 importantly, years ago, had promulgated its own Reg SHO 15 and had its own Locate requirements, its own Closeout 16 requirements, and there was a State cause of action 17 saying you violated the New Jersey Reg SHO and you 18 caused us injury, we wouldn't be here.  There might be a 19 preemption argument that the State can't do that, but 20 that would not trigger Section 27 jurisdiction, because 21 you're clearly seeking  22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you would have no 23  24             MR. HACKER:   to enforce New Jersey duty. 25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You would have no

18 1 case if New Jersey passed a law saying, as a matter of 2 New Jersey law, we hereby adopt, you know, everything 3 under the Securities Exchange Act, including, in 4 particular, Regulation SHO.  That is State law.  We're 5 following the Federal law because, you know, we think 6 it's easier to do that than write up our own securities 7 code. 8             That's fine with you? 9             MR. HACKER:  No.  That's a different case, 10 because there, the New  New Jersey isn't making its 11 own politically accountable decision  12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, it is.  It's 13 saying  it's saying wherever it says Federal law as  14 we just strike that and put in New Jersey law.  They can 15 do that.  They can adopt whatever law  source of law 16 they want. 17             MR. HACKER:  Sure. 18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even though it's 19 precisely the same at the same level of detail, you have 20 to say under your theory that if you sue just under the 21 New Jersey law, that's okay. 22             MR. HACKER:  I don't think so, Your Honor, 23 because there New Jersey is leaving to Congress and the 24 SEC to decide what the law is.  The duties are always  25 under that structure, the duties are always created by

HACKER:  The duty is created by the  5 by the Exchange Act and its regulations. 6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, the duty under 7 New Jersey law is passed by whatever statute they enact 8 saying we  us too, we want to do it as well, as a 9 matter of New Jersey law. 10             MR. HACKER:  But they can do it separate. 11 They can establish their own independent duties. 12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah. 13             MR. HACKER:  But when they consciously 14 choose not to create an independent duty, but to say 15 that we're going to  literally, in the hypothetical 16 you're adopting, they're literally saying we're 17 incorporating the Federal duty.  And in that 18 situation  19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And as New Jersey  20 as New Jersey law. 21             MR. HACKER:  Right.  But that's still 22 seeking  an action under that law would still be 23 seeking to enforce a duty created by the Exchange Act 24 and its regulations, you know, albeit incorporated into 25 State law.  It's a different type of case.

20 1             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But then you're going to be 2 in a situation where the judge is going to have to try 3 to figure out whether State law exactly mimics Federal 4 law, or whether there are minor deviations from Federal 5 law.  And that can't be a good jurisdictional test, can 6 it? 7             MR. HACKER:  Well, all jurisdictional tests 8 will have, you know, challenges at the margin. 9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't think this is a 10 marginal question.  I think this is kind of a, you know, 11 pretty ordinary question of like, well, what is the 12 State law doing?  Is it exactly  lots of State laws 13 exactly mimic Federal law, and lots of them don't. 14             MR. HACKER:  I think, in practice, there is 15 quite a clear margin because States make different 16 choices in this.  If a State wants to say, as plenty do, 17 that we are just in haec verba incorporating the Federal 18 standard, then you  the  the duty is created by the 19 Federal standard, and becomes enforceable under State 20 law. 21             But the duty still is created by Federal 22 law.  States make other clear, distinct choices where 23 they say we're going to have a fraud law; we're going to 24 have our own securities laws.  New Jersey has its own 25 securities laws.  It could, if it wanted to, adopt a Reg

2             JUSTICE ALITO:  Why couldn't the New Jersey

3 Supreme Court  why couldn't the New Jersey Supreme

4 Court say this is our interpretation of a provision of

5 the  the New Jersey Uniform Securities Act, with

6 respect to short selling, this is what it means, and

7 without ever referring to Reg SHO, adopt basically the

8 same or exactly the same rule that is incorporated in

9 that regulation?  Would you say that then an  that an

10 action under that provision of the New Jersey Securities

11 Act would be one seeking to enforce a Federal duty?

12             MR. HACKER:  No.  I think that would be a

13 different case where the State is saying, you know, this

14 seems like a pretty good rule; we're going to adopt it

15 because we like it, adopt it independently as our own

16 rule.  And in any future case, they might do something

17 different.  As happened in the very New Jersey case, the

18 Third Circuit cited for the proposition that New Jersey

19 law sometimes different  differs from Federal law.  It

20 can, but here, the complaint

22

2 New Jersey law; they have to actually go ahead and

3 reprint everything that SHO says, and then it's okay.

4             MR. HACKER:  Well, no.  It's  it

5 definitely is a politically accountable choice if the

6 New Jersey, you know, wants to go to its  the 

7 the  the people in New Jersey and all the interested

8 parties and say, we think  we don't like the way the

9 SEC has balanced the many competing interests involved

10 in regulating the market for, in this case, the

11 electronic market, and short selling in the

12 United States; we want it done differently in

13 New Jersey.  And all of the competing interest parties

14 can come and  and talk to New Jersey about whether it

15 should  they should do it that way or not.

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if  what if the

17 State law says  and I'm not sure this one doesn't.

18 What if the State law says, we are adopting the

19 disposition of the current regulation in, you know, in

20  in 2015; all right?  That's all it says.  So if that

21 regulation changes and Federal law changes, State law

22 would not change.  What happens in that situation?

23             MR. HACKER:  I mean, that would be an

24 unusual way for a court to conduct itself, but if it did

25 that

2             MR. HACKER:  Well, I've never seen it

3 before.

4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The court likes this

5 regulation.  It doesn't know what this kooky SEC is

6 going to do in the future.  This regulation is okay.  So

7 they put that  they put that into State law.

8             MR. HACKER:  I think that's right if the

9 court said and made it clear that we find, as a matter

10 of New Jersey fraud, that under New Jersey fraud law, if

11 you don't get a Locate in accordance with SEC

12 requirements 

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Current SEC requirements.

14             MR. HACKER:  Yeah, and that could change.

15 And it's clear that it's an independent  independently

16 created duty, but none of this is at issue here.

17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that what the

18 court is going to do when it hears this action?

19             MR. HACKER:  I'm sorry?

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that what the

21 State court's going to do when it hears this action?

22 There's nothing about the alleged causes of action 

23 they allege theft and fraud.  So they're going to have

24 to prove theft and fraud under State law as defined in

25 the sections that they've cited.

Alderson Reporting Company

24 1             MR. HACKER:  But  well, they also allege 2 unjust enrichment and negligence  3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All of that. 4             MR. HACKER:  Right. 5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, that might be 6 something you could object to at trial if they try to 7 say State law is the same as Federal law and can't prove 8 it.  You then appeal that decision if it's wrong.  If 9 State law is different, you prove it's different.  I'm 10 just not sure what that has to do with the wellpleaded 11 complaint that  that they are saying this is a duty 12 that arises under the theft and fraud provisions of 13 New Jersey's uniform Securities Act. 14             MR. HACKER:  Right.  You won't see that 15 sentence anywhere in this complaint.  It doesn't exist. 16 What this complaint says is, in paragraph 24, it says 17 that illegal short selling is short selling that, quote, 18 "violates securities laws and regulations."  That's what 19 they're complaining about.  Short selling defined as 20 something that violates securities laws and regulations. 21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Surely they mean the 22 current regulations, right?  And you've just told me 23 that if the State law applies only to the current 24 regulation, it is not adopting Federal law, right?  So 25 this complaint is referring to the current regulation.
Alderson Reporting Company

25 1 How do you know it's referring to that regulation as it 2 may change in the future? 3             MR. HACKER:  Well, it's  well, it's 4 referring to past conduct.  So it's saying what you did 5 injured us  6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right. 7             MR. HACKER:   because you violated the 8 regulation as it exists today.  You committed this 9 illegal short selling.  You didn't get Locates as they 10 think  11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Fine. 12             MR. HACKER:   the SEC would require. 13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because that regulation is 14 a good regulation, and it ought to be New Jersey law. 15 But if that regulation changes, we  we don't say that 16 it ought to be New Jersey law. 17             MR. HACKER:  Let me try an exercise.  If you 18 eliminated  all of this suggests that you could just 19 as easily eliminate all of the references to Reg SHO, 20 all of the references to capital L, Locate, capital C, 21 CloseOut, and their complaint would just proceed the 22 same way it would.  And we know that that's not true 23 because they've got no source  if they have a 24 complaint like that that just says, this is fraud, this 25 is tortious interference, we're unhappy about it because

26 1 you didn't short sell the way we wish you would, they 2 would have literally nothing in New Jersey law to cite 3 to. 4             JUSTICE BREYER:  Then they'll lose under  5 they brought a claim  look, is it a necessary  as a 6 Federal issue, Federal issue is whether what they've 7 done violates Regulation SHO.  They don't say that 8 anywhere in the complaint, not even in paragraph 24, but 9 you cite it, I read.  This is background.  They don't 10 say anything about it, but is it necessary?  Is it 11 necessary for them to prevail that they prove a 12 violation of Regulation SHO? 13             MR. HACKER:  We think it is, but that's  14             JUSTICE BREYER:  What do they  15             MR. HACKER:   not the question here. 16             JUSTICE BREYER:  I didn't ask you that.

1 it isn't necessary.  Okay?

27

2             MR. HACKER:  Right.

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  So if it is necessary and

4 you're right, then this case should have been brought

5 under 1331.

6             MR. HACKER:  That 

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  It wasn't, and we're not

8 deciding that.  So since we're not deciding it, we have

9 to assume that it is not necessary.

10             MR. HACKER:  Correct.

11             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay?  If we assume it is

12 not necessary, if we assume that the conditions for 1331

13 are not met, and therefore it doesn't get into Federal

14 court for that reason, why would anyone want a case like

15 that in Federal court when the States want to adjudicate

16 it?

17             MR. HACKER:  Because Congress wanted it in

18 Federal court 

19             JUSTICE BREYER:  And what is the evidence

20 that Congress wanted that?

21             MR. HACKER:  The language of the statute.

22             JUSTICE BREYER:  And all you're left with

23 is, you say, read the language of the statute, don't

24 look to the purpose, don't look to surrounding  don't

25 look to the surrounding rules of law which actually make

I'm 9 not saying you're going to win on the language. 10             MR. HACKER:  No, I  but I couldn't 11 disagree with you more. 12             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Go ahead. 13             MR. HACKER:  The language, first of all, I 14 think is unambiguous in our favor.  But we absolutely 15 believe the objectives and purpose are uniformly in our 16 favor because what you know, if nothing else, about 17 Section 27 is that Congress, unlike  unlike all of the 18 other jurisdictional statutes that use decidedly 19 different language, Congress here did not want State 20 courts to adjudicate duties created  21             JUSTICE BREYER:  So why  why isn't the SEC 22 here? 23             MR.

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  Curious.

3             MR. HACKER:  Right.  That's for the SEC, but

4 you know, we would not, I think, construe a statute

5 based on the absence of the SEC 

6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You are relying on a

7 different language.  This is not arising under, but the

8 special language in Section 27.  And we have a brief;

9 it's a public citizen brief that says, well, this is 

10 this Section 27 is not unusual.  It lists about, what is

11 it, some ten other statutes that are phrased the same

12 way.

13             MR. HACKER:  Right.

14             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So with respect to every

15 one of those statutes, Public Utilities Holding Company,

16 Federal Power Act, Connally Hot Oil, the same argument

17 would apply to those statutes.

18             MR. HACKER:  Those are all similarly

19 narrowly prescribed statutes.  And as the public citizen

20 itself indicates, those were enacted mostly in the New

21 Deal era when we know, if anything, Congress was looking

22 to expand opportunities for plaintiffs to get into

23 Federal court.  And it wouldn't be surprising at all

24 that New Deal statutes would favor Federal court

25 adjudication of Federal duties.

3 that interpretation, even as to the Natural Gas Act

4 consistent with Pan American?

5             MR. HACKER:  Yes.  Pan American was purely a

6 wellpleaded complaint rule case.  And the footnote that

7 the other side relies on, referring to arising under,

8 was simply saying the fact they used different language

9 doesn't change the fact the wellpleaded complaint rule

17               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

18             MR. STRIS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

19 and may it please the Court:

20             It is wellsettled that jurisdictional

21 statutes will not be interpreted to intrude on State

22 judicial authority unless Congress makes its intention

23 clear.

24             Petitioners ask this Court to interpret

25 Section 27 of the Exchange Act to strip State courts of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
31 1 jurisdiction, to decide State lawcreated claims when 2 such claims have already failed the Grable test.  There 3 is no indication that Congress clearly intended such an 4 unprecedented intrusion on State court authority. 5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why do you think, Mr. Stris, 6 this different language was used in these ten statutes? 7             MR. STRIS:  So my  my best answer is to 8 mirror, essentially, what our amici public citizen and 9 the State securities regulators have said, which is at 10 the time that certainly the '33 Act and the '34 Act were 11 passed, the Federal question statute had an 12 amountincontroversy requirement. 13             Now, I understand that my friend, Mr. 14 Hacker, points out in his reply that there's a current 15 statute, 28 U.S.C. 1337, that was enacted in 1948.  It 16 had a predecessor statute, 28 U.S.C. 41(8) that was 17 enacted in 1911 that removed the amountincontroversy 18 requirement for cases involving interstate commerce. 19             And one would think, because it's the case 20 today, that that would apply to securities.  But as best 21 we can understand from our research, in the years that 22 are relevant, 1911 to the time of the '33 Act and '34 23 Act, it was not interpreted that way. 24             So there was essentially an 25 amountincontroversy requirement for securities cases.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 So I think, if I were to 

32

2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The amount in controversy

3 wasn't very high.  And wouldn't most cases of this

4 character easily meet it?

5             MR. STRIS:  I don't know that that's true,

6 Justice Ginsburg.  But more importantly to  to your

7 question 

8             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If it was $3,000,

9 something like that?

10             MR. STRIS:  Well 

11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Or even less?

12             MR. STRIS:  If we're attempting to ascertain

13 why Congress would choose to use this language instead

14 of other language, I would submit that any

15 amountincontroversy requirement, if they felt they

16 didn't want that for purposes of Federallycreated

17 claims  so this is going to segue into my first

18 point  we think the most natural reading of Section 27

19 is as a creation test.

20             And so if that's what 

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  $3,000 is probably a lot of

22 money today.

23             MR. STRIS:  I'm sorry?

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  $3,000 is probably a lot of

25 money today.

3 3,000 1934 dollars?

4             MR. STRIS:  Yeah.  I  I  I don't want to

5 get into any debate 

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's a yesorno

7 question, counsel.

8             (Laughter.)

9             MR. STRIS:  I would like any money that

10 anyone on the Court or in the courthouse would like to

11 give me, and I'll be taking collections after  after

12 the argument.

13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If  if  if your answer

14 is correct, why do they need to use the term

15 "exclusive"?  Why don't they just  just  just 

16             MR. STRIS:  So let me 

17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   there is jurisdiction

18 in Federal court.  That  why  that doesn't explain

19 the  the use of the word "exclusive."

20             MR. STRIS:  No, no.  But I think it does.

21 So  so this particular statutory language is found in

22 eleven statutes.  In some of them, they used the term

23 "exclusive jurisdiction"; in  in others, they did not.

24             What follows exclusive jurisdiction is

25 essentially a creation test that  which I'll explain

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 in a moment.  The fact that they chose to confer

34

2 exclusive jurisdiction here just means that, when there

3 was a cause of action that was created by the

4 Exchange Act, they wanted it to be in Federal court.

5             So  so let me  let me get to the spirit

6 of  of the answer, which is why I think that there's

7 good reason to believe that exclusive jurisdiction in

8 the statute is limited to causes of action that are

9 created by the Act itself.

10             So my friend Mr. Hacker concedes, I think

11 reasonably, that if someone sues under a parallel State

12 duty, that that is only a duty under  that's a lawsuit

13 that's brought to enforce only a duty under State law.

14 I was pleased to hear that, because I think that is the

15 most natural reading of  of the language.

16             Our position is that the result is no

17 different if a State accomplishes the same thing through

18 the expedience of incorporating or referencing Federal

19 law.

20             And I want to be clear on this point.  Our

21 position is not that the plain meaning of the statute

22 compels that interpretation.  I'll be the first to say

23 that one could theoretically read the  the language

24 brought to enforce a liability or duty created by the

25 Act or its regulations the way that my  my friend

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
35 1 suggests.  One could.  But I think it starts to break 2 down and not really make much sense if we look at what's 3 missing from Section 27. 4             Here's what's missing:  There is no Federal 5 jurisdiction over Exchange Act counterclaims, which 6 means that State court  7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Over  8             MR. STRIS:  I'm sorry.  Over Exchange Act 9 counterclaims.  So that means that Congress was willing 10 to have State courts adjudicate claims that were created 11 by the Act itself. 12             There is no exclusive jurisdiction over 13 Exchange Act defenses.  And most notably, that would 14 include preemption.  And in the minerun of preemption 15 cases  and I'm going to get to this in a little bit  16 not only is the State court determining what the 17 Exchange Act says, but it's doing it for the purpose of 18 assessing whether there is a conflict between State and 19 Federal law. 20             It's really important that those two things 21 are missing from the statute, because I find it very 22 difficult to believe that a Congress that was not 23 concerned about State courts adjudicating those cases 24 somehow would be very concerned about a State court 25 adjudicating a State lawcreated cause of action that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 happened to implicate a Federal duty or a liability.

36

2             When we look at the language and we take it

3 in context, I think it just 

4             JUSTICE ALITO:  But Congress must have 

5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I  go ahead, please.

6             JUSTICE ALITO:  Congress must have had in

7 mind a certain category of claims that it did not want

8 adjudicated in State court, correct?

9             MR. STRIS:  I agree.

10             JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  So you seem to

11 be saying that the category of claims they did not want

12 adjudicated in State court are only these:  Those in

13 which the plaintiff is asking for the enforcement of a

14 Federal duty, and there is no comparable State duty at

15 that time, and the State court is unwilling to recognize

16 a comparable State duty in the context of that

17 litigation.

18             So these are essentially cases in which the

19 State is basically hostile to the Federal duty.  And

20 those are the only cases that Congress did not want to

21 have adjudicated in State court.

22             Am I  have you gone wrong in that?

23             MR. STRIS:  I  I don't think you've gone

24 wrong, but I think that that position is firmly

25 supported by history, if we look at the context.

1             And let me explain what I mean.

37

2             So at the time the Exchange Act was passed,

3 there were only three express rights of action, and they

4 were very minor.  There was no private right of action

5 under 10(b); there was a market manipulation of a 9(a),

6 shortswing profits; and a third one that I don't

7 recall.

8             So if we look at the context, we have a

9 history of States regulating securities.  We have a

10 parallel provision in the Exchange Act, Section 28, that

11 this Court in Matsushita acknowledged, expressly

12 endorsed the fact that States were going to continue to

13 regulate.

14             So I think the Congress that passed the '34

15 Act was thinking the following:  They were thinking we

16 have a very narrow window of claims that are created by

17 this Act.  And for those, a 9(a) straightforward market

18 manipulation claim, for  for  for wash sales.  We

19 don't want State courts adjudicating those, because

20 those are very technical.  We want exclusive

21 jurisdiction over those claims.

22             And I think that's the extent of what

23 Congress intended in passing this provision.

24             Now 

25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Supposing that you had

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
38 1 brought this claim specifically to enjoin violations of 2 this SHO regulation.  So that's your complaint.  Court, 3 please enjoin the defendant from violating SHO. 4             MR. STRIS:  Well, I think as a factual 5 matter, Justice Ginsburg, that couldn't happen because 6 the conduct would have already occurred.  But I won't 7 resist the hypothetical. 8             I think  I think the hypothetical you're 9 asking reveals the most difficult part of our plaintext 10 interpretation, which is assume a State statute that 11 seeks to enjoin what is only a federallycreated duty. 12 I don't know that that would come up, but it could, 13 theoretically. 14             Our position would be that that is still 15 best interpreted as a lawsuit brought to enforce a duty 16 or a liability created by State law, because the  the 17 State has decided by reference to have the duty being 18 don't violate the  the  the Federal standard that 19 you would get the injunction for. 20             And I think, in the real world, what we're 21 seeing are, at best, States that are creating parallel 22 provisions that incorporate duties and liabilities 23 merely because it's an expedient.  And so I think 24 that  I guess before I move on  you know, 25 administrative simplicity is a  is a major virtue in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
39 1 any jurisdictional statute.  I know the Court has said 2 that before.  Without any strong evidence to interpret 3 Section 27 as anything other than a creation test, I 4 think that's the best result. 5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask you to describe 6 your complaint?  In other words, Mr. Hacker has a 7 certain characterization or description of your 8 complaint, and the  and the  the role played in your 9 complaint by the regulation.  So if you had to describe 10 your complaint, and particularly, what role does this 11 regulation play in your claims under State law? 12             MR. STRIS:  I understand, Justice Kagan. 13             So I think there's been some 14 misunderstanding of what we're alleging.  We are not 15 relying on Reg SHO for any theory of liability, and 16 here's why:  We're bringing a straightup 17 marketmanipulation claim.  And what that means is we're 18 suggesting that the naked shortselling that happened 19 was not just a technical infraction, not just a 20 technical violation of Reg SHO, but was done with the 21 purpose of depressing sales prices  or prices of the 22 security.  That's an analogue to a 10b5 action. 23             And so if we look at paragraph 30 of our 24 complaint  this is on pages 53A to  to 54A  we 25 make clear that the relevant provision of New Jersey law
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
40 1 is substantially similar to the Federal securities law. 2             We're referring to 10(b).  When  when the 3 Uniform Securities Act was promulgated in 1956, 4 Section 101, which New Jersey adopted, mirrors 10(b). 5             If you're going to bring a claim under 6 Federal law, you're not suing under Reg SHO. 7 Manipulative shortselling existed well before Reg SHO. 8 It's a standard.  You're basically saying someone is 9 taking a short position.  They're injecting inaccurate 10 information into the market because they have taken a 11 position that's larger than normal supply and  and 12 demand would  would bear, given the size of the public 13 float.  They've chosen to do that because they think 14 it's going to drive prices down and they're going to 15 make more money. 16             You don't need to prove all of that to get a 17 violation of Reg SHO.  Reg SHO was enacted by the SEC 18 because this was a problem.  What Reg SHO does is it 19 allows the SEC to take enforcement action and to fine 20 people that engage in conduct that is likely to 21 constitute market manipulation. 22             The point of it is not to punish market 23 manipulation.  The point is to try and stop people from 24 doing it in the first place. 25             To put it  to put it differently

41 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I just  yes. 2 I mean, but there are parts of your complaint that go in 3 much greater detail and focus on the Federal Rules. 4 I  I think Paragraph 33 says, you know, as set forth 5 in detail herein, the defendants violated the trading 6 rules and regulations requiring that they actually 7 deliver shares they owed to the DTCC to settle 8 shortsale transactions. 9             That's a duty imposed by Federal law. 10             MR. STRIS:  This is a very important point, 11 Mr. Chief Justice.  We mention this in detail for a very 12 specific reason.  It has nothing to do with our theory 13 of liability.  It was us attempting to get in front of 14 the inevitable preemption defense, which happens.  These 15 shortselling cases get litigated  get litigated in 16 State court.  A very significant one is on page 25 of 17 the blue brief, note 8.  It's in California State court, 18 overstock. 19             In these cases, the  the largest defense 20 that's asserted in State court is, we complied with Reg 21 SHO.  We complied with the Federal Rules.  So if State 22 law gives you a remedy, it must be conflict preempted. 23 So  24             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, along these lines, 25 look  look at Count 9, 100a of Appendix to the
Alderson Reporting Company

1 Petition.  "Each defendant 

42

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What page is that?

3             JUSTICE ALITO:  100a.

4             "Each defendant enterprise owed plaintiffs a

5 duty of care in their capacity as gatekeepers of the

6 market.  Each depend  each defendant enterprise

7 breached the duty of care that they owed to the

8 plaintiffs to report suspicious transactions and naked

9 short sales."

10             Where does that  doesn't that come right

11 from Reg SHO?

12             MR. STRIS:  Look, I'm not going to suggest,

13 Justice Alito, that Reg SHO isn't relevant as a

14 background proposition.  We're in a regulated market, so

15 of course, the  the  the landscape that exists is

16 going to implicate Federal rules.  The relevant question

17 is:  Jurisdiction can't be sustained on a theory that we

18 haven't advanced, right?

19             JUSTICE ALITO:  But that doesn't seem to 

20 that doesn't seem to be relying on Reg SHO as a

21 background proposition.  You say that they breached a 

22 this is a claim for negligence, requires a breach of a

23 duty, and you say the duty that they breached is a duty

24 that's created by Reg SHO.

25             MR. STRIS:  I  I  I would characterize

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 it a little bit differently.  Here  here's what I

43

2 would say.  I would say that if market manipulation

3 requires that someone do something that injects

4 inaccurate or artificial information into the market,

5 that's the theory of a market manipulation claim.

6 You're messing with natural supply and demand forces.

7             Of course, any theory of market

8 manipulation, including under State law, would have to

9 reference and talk about the ground rules, because the

10 ground rules that are set up by the SEC are what set up

11 the market's normal expectations of traditional supply

12 and demand forces.  So it would really tie our hands to

13 say that any time you talk about someone doing something

14 that is inconsistent with the regulatory scheme, you

15 can't bring a State law claim that is truly a State law

16 claim, because if you're trying to allege that

17 there's 

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  That isn't what it's

19 saying.  It's saying they breached the duty of care that

20 they owed to the plaintiffs to report suspicious

21 transactions of naked short sales.  That's the

22 allegation under negligence.

23             What duty of care?  A duty of care imposed

24 by New Jersey law?  What New Jersey law?

25             MR. STRIS:  New 

Alderson Reporting Company

1             JUSTICE BREYER:  Or is it a duty of care

44

2 imposed by SHO?

3             MR. STRIS:  It's a duty of care, Justice

4 Breyer, imposed by New Jersey State law.

5             JUSTICE BREYER:  Which State law?

6             MR. STRIS:  New Jersey Statute 49:349.

7 It's found on pages 84a to 87a of the  the Petition

8 Appendix, and what it does is it's the section of 101 of

9 the Uniform Securities Act that mirrors 10b5.

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  And so the exact words

11 there that the duty of care is referring to are what?

12             MR. STRIS:  I believe it says 

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  If you know.

14             MR. STRIS:   you can't engage in deceptive

15 or manipulative conduct.  What we 

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  I see what you're saying.

17             MR. STRIS:  What we attempted to do here 

18 we may lose on this point in State court.

19             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  I  I have a bigger

20  a question that I can't get  I can't figure out,

21 and so I would like your help.

22             Let's go through this.  Let's suppose, for

23 present purposes, that as I read through your complaint,

24 I find words  it's not the words we just said, but

25 similar words somewhere, and I sink  think, but there

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 is nothing under New Jersey law unless New Jersey picks 2 up SHO.  All right? 3             Why isn't that good enough on that matter to 4 get them into Federal court in arising under cases? 5             MR. STRIS:  Okay.  So if  if we're out of 6 the world, and you've rejected my creation argument  7             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm doing it for argument 8 because  9             MR. STRIS:  Yes. 10             JUSTICE BREYER:   I'm really concerned 11 about I can't clarify in my mind the difference between 12 somebody being thrown out in an arising under case, and 13 yet getting back in under Section 27.  That's what 14 doesn't make too much sense to me.  If this is 15 necessary  the Federal issue is necessary for the 16 plaintiffs to win, there's arising under jurisdiction. 17 Then I don't know what to do with the word "exclusive." 18 But all that seems not to be in the case. 19             MR. STRIS:  Well  20             JUSTICE BREYER:  So  so then, if  if it 21 is not sufficient to get in under arising under, why in 22 heaven's name should it be to get in under 27? 23             MR. STRIS:  Well, I mean, obviously, I'm not 24 going to resist, but what I would  25             JUSTICE BREYER:  You're not going to resist
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1 my conclusion, but you see, it's  it's  I  I need 2 clarification, because I'm not sure I've thought it 3 through correctly. 4             MR. STRIS:  So here  here's my best 5 attempt to clarify.  I think  let me throw away the 6 facts for a minute.  In other words, I think there's no 7 theory that we've pled that satisfies even their 8 standard, but let me throw that away.  Let me assume the 9 best case for them, that we've relied on Federal duties 10 and try and put it through those  the  the  the 11 legal question that you've asked. 12             I think one way to resolve this is to take 13 the simple approach, which is what I advocated first, 14 and to say, look, if it's just enforcing a State law 15 cause of action, even if it incorporates Federal law, 16 that's all 27 does, and you're done.  I understand the 17 premise of your question is let's say you've rejected 18 that, and we're thinking, you know what, maybe some 19 Statelaw claims fall within the sweep of Section 27; 20 how do we think about this? 21             Here's what I would say.  I would say that 22 whether this is an arising under statute or not, it has 23 to incorporate what I'll call a Federal necessity 24 requirement, because that's a longstanding rule that's 25 part and parcel of the wellpleaded complaint rule.  And
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
47 1 if you look at Pan American, for example.  Let's say I 2 accept what my friend Mr. Hacker says that it's dicta, 3 they weren't saying it's an arising under statute, they 4 applied  this Court applied the wellpleaded complaint 5 rule without looking at the text of the statute at all. 6 It's a sensible thing to say that when Federal 7 jurisdiction over Statelaw claims is predicated on the 8 Federal character, there being a Federal issue, that we 9 use the wellpleaded complaint rule. 10             It's also similarly sensible that the 11 wellpleaded complaint rule would have an adjunct which 12 is Federal necessity, and that's precisely what the 13 Court said in Christianson.  And I'll quote the Court: 14 "The wellpleaded complaint rule focuses on claims, not 15 theories, and just because an element that's essential 16 to a particular theory might be governed by Federal 17 patent law does not mean the entire monopolization claim 18 arises under patent law." 19             Now, to the second half of your question, 20 which is, well, how does that  how do they map 21 together?  Well, then the question becomes how did we 22 allegedly use this Federally?  Do we use it in our RICO 23 claim as one of several predicate acts?  That's all 24 that's ever been alleged until today.  I was surprised 25 to hear a suggestion that  well, I shouldn't say until
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 today; until the briefing in this Court.

48

2             In the lower court, the suggestion was that

3 we relied on a Federal duty because it was somehow being

4 snuck in as a  an additional predicate of our RICO

5 claim.  I resist that cause  that claim.  If you go

6 and look at the pages, we allege three 

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  Right, something.  And 

8 and don't tell me I'm right if you think it favors you,

9 because maybe it does favor you, but I've got  there

10 will be other cases, you know, so sympathize a little

11 with my problem.

12             MR. STRIS:  Okay.

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm looking for a way to

14 see if we really have to answer all these difficult

15 questions that have been raised, which are pretty tough.

16 And so I was thinking, look, here's what you look to.

17 Judge, see if it is a necessary thing, and if so,

18 whether it falls under 1331.  Okay?  If it's an arising

19 under claim under 1331, kick it out of State court and

20 send it to Federal court.

21             But if it isn't an arising under claim

22 because it isn't necessary to winning for the plaintiff,

23 forget about it.  Keep it in State court.  I don't care

24 whether it's  don't  don't worry about whether the

25 State passed it this way, or the State legislature

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
49 1 referenced it by numbers or referenced it by  don't 2 worry about all that stuff.  Just decide one question. 3             MR. STRIS:  So  4             JUSTICE BREYER:  Does it meet the four 5 criteria for arising under?  If so, kick it out.  If 6 not, keep it. 7             MR. STRIS:  So, Justice Breyer, here are my 8  here are my thoughts on this.  I think that the 9 Grable  10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I just clarify?  I 11 thought it was conceded there was no arising under 12 jurisdiction. 13             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true.  I'm not 14 looking in this case.  I'm looking for the general rule. 15             MR. STRIS:  That  that's how  that's how 16 I understood  that's how I understood the question. 17             And so as to the general rule, here are my 18 thoughts.  The  1331 still exists.  1331 is powerful, 19 and we can call it Jackson Pollock all we want, but it's 20 been adopted, it exists, and it's applied by courts.  So 21 I think that there is a very small distinction between 22 incorporating it here or not.  There is a distinction, 23 exclusivity versus  versus nonexclusivity, I 24 understand that; but my point is the simplest way of out 25 this morass, I think, is to say we want a simple,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
50 1 administratable rule and we only look to 27 to confer 2 jurisdiction over Exchange Actcreated claims, and we 3 have, as a backdrop, 1331. 4             Now, if you resist that, Justice Breyer, and 5 you don't like that and you say, okay, well, what's the 6 secondbest option?  There  there's  there's two, 7 and I don't really need to advocate one as opposed to 8 the other because we win under both, but I'll throw them 9 out there. 10             One is to say we don't have to call this an 11 arising under statute.  We don't have to reach the 12 difficult question of, well, was  was that what Pan 13 American was holding; did they  did Congress intend to 14 incorporate 1331 wholesale in all of its elements? 15 There  there's a simple way out, which is to say the 16 notion of Federal necessity  this is the one question 17 that you were saying  does not inhere in the words 18 "arising under."  It inheres in the wellpleaded 19 complaint rule, which is a backdrop presumption which 20 should apply to any type of congressional grant of  of 21 Federal jurisdiction over State law claims unless 22 Congress says otherwise. 23             So I think that's the secondbest option. 24 You say, okay, it's not only a creation test.  Section 25 27 can reach some State lawcreated claims, but they
Alderson Reporting Company

1 must be necessary.

Official

51

2             And there's a long jurisprudence of this

3 Court.  It's in the arising under context of what it

4 means to be necessary.  And then you don't have the

5 difficulty of trying to look to whether it's

6 substantial, doing a Federalism balance.  You would

7 essentially assume if it's something that trigger  is

8 triggered by an exclusive jurisdiction provision of the

9 Exchange Act, it must be substantial; it must fit the

10 Federalism balance.

11             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Stris, I guess I don't

12 understand why you're resisting just say saying this

13 language ought to be interpreted in the same way as

14 arising under jurisdiction is interpreted.  And it's

15 true they're different words, but it's at least as good

16 an interpretation of these words that they essentially

17 refer to what the arising under test refers to, which

18 after all  I mean, the arising under test doesn't

19 really have a whole lot to do with the language arising

20 under anymore.

21             MR. STRIS:  No, that's true.

22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So  so why isn't that just

23 sort of the simplest thing to do is, we have a test,

24 it's a fourpart test, and this language seems to fit

25 that test pretty well, and that's what we should do, we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 should just have one test.

52

2             MR. STRIS:  Well, so Justice Kagan, I won't

3 resist too hard because obviously we win under that 

4 under that outcome.  I resist a  I resist a little

5 bit, and I'll tell you why.

6             Certainly I can defend that proposition, and

7 we did in our  in our briefing.  There  there is a

8 solid basis to do that.  The Court interpreted

9 materially identical language that way in Pan American,

10 as we pointed out in our brief Section 22 of the

11 Securities Act, which uses materially identical

12 language.  Then in the removal bar equates that language

13 with arising under.  I could defend that proposition.  I

14 just don't think it's the most natural reading of the

15 language.

16             If you're asking me honestly, like what do I

17 think Congress intended?  I  I believe that they

18 intended "brought to enforce" duties or liabilities

19 created under  under the Act to mean the three narrow

20 categories of Federally created causes of action in

21 1934.  I think that's what the statute meant.  I don't

22 think Congress has done anything since then to change

23 that.

24             If you look to SLUSA in 1998 where there was

25 this serious concern on the part of Congress of what was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 happening in terms of State lawcreated causes of

53

2 action, the initial bill that was proposed would have

3 preempted all State lawcreated causes of action.  It

4 didn't go very far.  Instead, Congress said, no, we're

5 going to restrict this to covered class actions.

6             So if  if you're  if we're trying to

7 find what I think is the most intellectually honest

8 reading of the language, and consistent with the

9 history, I actually don't think it's adopting arising

10 under, but I certainly could defend it as a reasonable

11 interpretation of the language in the context.

12             JUSTICE ALITO:  So in light of SLUSA, the

13 issue that's before us would apply only in individual

14 actions and small class actions?

15             MR. STRIS:  That's  that's exactly right.

16 And I think maybe I'll  maybe I'll close with this.  I

17 think that's very important from the perspective of just

18 sensibility and policy, which is the following.

19             One of the things that  that animated the

20 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act was the concern

21 that lawyers were driving litigation and not clients.

22 And that's why, for example, one of the things that went

23 into the PSLRA was a requirement of who the most

24 appropriate plaintiff is.  That doesn't happen when you

25 have cases like this, when you have the CEO of a company

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 who holds 2.1 million shares who's bringing a claim.

54

2             And so not only was it not the point of

3 Congress in 1933 and 1934 to invade the province of

4 State courts, if we look at the entire history of

5 purposes and  and Congress trying to say, well, we

6 have some concerns about what State courts are doing,

7 there has never been an express concern about State

8 courts enforcing State law in individual actions like

9 this one.

10             For the Court to hold otherwise would be

11 unprecedented because you would be stripping State

12 courts of the type of jurisdiction that they've had

13 since the time of the Exchange Act.  10(b) of the

14 Exchange Act itself was predicated on common law deceit

15 and fraud and a whole history of what was occurring in

16 State courts.  And I just don't think there's any way to

17 read Section 27 that's workable from the Court's

18 jurisdictional precedents, but it's also sensible in

19 terms of what the dual system of securities regulation

20 is trying to do.

21             And so if there are no further questions.

22             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, just out of curiosity,

23 why is it so important for your client not to be in

24 Federal district court?

25             MR. STRIS:  So I think there's a few

55 1 reasons.  The first is his lawyer's practice in State 2 court.  They're familiar with the procedures; that's 3 where they want to be. 4             The second is the  the procedures are 5 better.  I mean, it's not a surprise that a lot of 6 securities plaintiffs want to be in State court.  In 7 some instances they want to be there because the law is 8 more robust.  There's no scienter requirement.  You can 9 bring a Holder claim.  That's actually not the case here 10 because New Jersey law happens to parallel so we don't 11 have those benefits.  But we want to be able to take a 12 RICO claim where we're trying to take a new area. 13             These naked short selling cases, they're 14 new.  You know, the Overstock case that's happened, we 15 would prefer a State forum for our State lawcreated 16 claims to convince a State court that this is actionable 17 and, you know, it should warrant punitive damages.  And 18 I think we have every right to do that as  as the 19 master of our complaint. 20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said that you could 21 prevail in this case without showing any violation of 22 the SHO regulation.  So could you explain how you could 23 prevail even if you don't show a violation. 24             MR. STRIS:  Right.  So I  I would put it 25 slightly differently.  If I said that, you know, I think

1 that's  it's imprecise.

56

2             Any act of market manipulation in the

3 context of naked short selling will necessarily violate

4 Regulation SHO, but every violation of Regulation SHO is

5 not market manipulation.

6             What Regulation SHO does is it sets a floor.

7 And if you engage in certain conduct, you  you short a

8 stock, you haven't borrowed it, you have no reason to

9 believe you've borrowed it, the SEC can fine you under

10 statutes where there's no prior right of action.  That

11 doesn't make out a market manipulation came  claim,

12 Justice Ginsburg.  To prove market manipulation, you

13 have to go a step further.  You have to show that that

14 was done intentionally to try and depress the value of

15 the stock.

16             So the point I was trying to make is if

17 there were an analogue to our State law claim, it's not

18 Reg SHO, it's 10b5.  And  and the idea that you can't

19 bring a parallel 10b5 action in State court and have

20 the State court adjudicate it, that's never been the

21 law.  But they're  they're essentially trying to do an

22 end run around that analysis by suggesting that somehow

23 Reg SHO is what we are trying to enforce.

24             Reg SHO is not relevant for that purpose.

25 Reg SHO doesn't help us.  Even under Federal law we

57 1 wouldn't have a private right of action.  Section 9(d) 2 of the Exchange Act, there's no private right of action 3 for that.  Section 10a1 of the Exchange Act.  These are 4 the ones that deal with naked short selling.  No private 5 right of action.  Has to be 10(b). 6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 7             Three minutes, Mr. Hacker. 8          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN D. HACKER 9               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 10             MR. HACKER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 11 please the Court: 12             The Respondents' argument has a problem with 13 the language, both of their own complaint and with the 14 language of the statute. 15             The complaint could not be clearer that, 16 while it's true there are references to market 17 manipulation, what they're trying to establish is market 18 manipulation by the mere fact that there were not 19 Locates that complied with a Reg SHO.  That's what 20 created what they call counterfeit shares.  That, in and 21 of itself, forgetting intent, is also what diluted the 22 shares and caused their problems.  That's clear from 23 paragraph 33.  It's clear in paragraph 86 and 87.  What 24 they talk about are violations of the rules and 25 regulations that caused them harm.

58 1             They would also like to establish a market 2 manipulation, I'm sure, if they could prove intent and 3 all of that.  But the whole point of  of the complaint 4 here is to say  is to hope they can get in front of a 5 jury and judge who will agree with them that those mere 6 regulations of Reg SHO in and of themselves establishes 7 the State torts that they are pursuing.  It's perfectly 8 clear in those paragraphs, and through the rest of the 9 complaint.  I don't think there's any ambiguity 10 whatsoever. 11             Nor is there ambiguity in the plain text of 12 the statute.  The first argument they make is that it 13 effectively incorporates the Holmesian view that it has 14 to be a cause of action created by the Act itself. 15             The  Section 27 answers that question.  It 16 doesn't say that jurisdiction is established for  over 17 causes of action established by the Exchange Act.  That 18 would have been the way that Congress would have said 19 it.  If they meant to say there is jurisdiction over 20 causes of action established by the Act, Congress would 21 have said that.  It didn't say anything like that.  What 22 it said was very much essentially the opposite or 23 something very different, which is suits brought to 24 enforce duties prescribed by  created by the Act. 25 It's about the substantive source of the  the source

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I always

3 thought violations had to do with criminal law.  And the

4 whole structure of this provision talks first  in the

5 first half of the first sentence it talks about

6 violations of the law.  The second sentence parallels

7 it, says criminal.  The second half of the first

8 sentence talks about all suits in equity at actions at

9 law, or actions at law.

10             MR. HACKER:  But 

11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know that 

12             MR. HACKER:   those are all civil actions.

13 It's clearly talking about civil actions.  The reference

14 to "violation" itself talks about suits in civil

15 actions for violations 

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It talks about criminal

17 proceedings.

18             MR. HACKER:  Right.  It  it  it

19 encompasses  the language also encompasses criminal

20 proceedings, but the references to suits brought to

21 enforce liabilities or duties is unambiguously about a

22 civil proceeding, and the other side doesn't disagree

23 with that.

24             But let me turn to the last point,

25 Justice Breyer's argument and I think Justice Kagan's,

1 that, well, maybe it's just the same thing as 1331.

60

2 That too is contrary to the text of the statute because

3 1331 has been construed  it also doesn't have the

4 textual requirement  as having this necessity

5 component precisely because if you don't have a

6 necessity component, then you're taking away from State

7 courts cases that State courts are competent to

8 adjudicate.

9             We know that Congress had literally the

10 opposite premise here, that they didn't want State

11 courts adjudicating, as Respondents' counsel's conceded,

12 a certain class of cases.

13             What class of cases is that?  The statute

14 tells us the answer.  It's those that are suits brought

15 to enforce duties.  For example, a RICO case with two

16 predicate acts:  One is a violation of Reg SHO; one is a

17 violation of State law.  It is unambiguously clear that

18 that is brought to enforce the duty prescribed by Reg

19 SHO, and in that circumstance, that kind of case,

20 Congress wanted to proceed solely in Federal court.

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

22             The case is submitted.

23             (Whereupon, at 11:08 a.m., the case in the

24 aboveentitled matter was submitted.)
