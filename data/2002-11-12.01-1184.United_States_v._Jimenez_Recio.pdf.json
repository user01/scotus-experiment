    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "That individual will -- in order to accomplish a withdrawal from the conspiracy has to do more than simply leave it. The law of withdrawal of a -- on withdrawal from a conspiracy requires that the conspirator do some affirmative act to terminate the existence of the conspiracy either by going to law enforcement, or by communicating to his fellow conspirators that he's done with the venture and he's out of it. But the termination of the participation of one co-conspirator through withdrawal or abandonment or telling law enforcement does not terminate the conspiracy. The very nature of conspiracy is a group of individuals who have come together to carry out an unlawful act, and in order for the conspiracy to do that, it frequently will grow and enlarge its membership. Other members may drop out. But so long as there is a common agreement to commit a definable crime or unlawful act, the conspiracy continues."

Certainly under the common law, you cannot have a unilateral conspiracy, although the Model Penal Code would have allowed that. There may, however, be policy reasons to hold that once a conspirator has embarked upon his venture, even if all of the other conspirators are arrested and give up the effort, that one lone conspirator who still soldiers on, without knowing that the other conspirators have abandoned it, might properly be held liable for seeking to accomplish the aims of the conspiracy."

And where the Ninth Circuit got off on the wrong foot was by believing that a conspiracy ends when its goals have been defeated. When the object of the conspiracy has been defeated, the Ninth Circuit thought, the conspiracy is over. That, however, is contradictory to the fundamental principle of conspiracy law that the essence of the crime is the agreement between the parties to carry out an unlawful act, and to take the --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Would you -- would you tell me what the conspiracy was that survived the -- the claimed end of the conspiracy? What -- what -- conspiracy to do what?"

    "speech": "Conspiracy to distribute and deliver marijuana and cocaine."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Was it the marijuana and cocaine that had already been seized by the Government, or some other marijuana?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "As the case comes to this Court, the conspiracy that survived was the conspiracy to distribute that cocaine and marijuana that had been seized. But what's crucial is that those conspirators who remained liable were entirely unaware that the Government had intervened and frustrated the objective of the conspiracy. And I think that the hypothetical that makes clear why the Ninth Circuit went wrong is the instance where the Government enters the market in a reverse sting operation and goes into the market as a seller, offering to sell drugs, and a collective of individuals decides to pool their resources and arrange to purchase the drugs that the Government is offering. It is highly likely that the Government has no intention and never had any intention of delivering actual drugs. Therefore, the goal of the conspirators is frustrated at the inception. They don't know it, but they could never accomplish the object of their conspiracy. Yet, it's settled in the Ninth Circuit and elsewhere that the conspirators can still be held liable because their agreement to perform an act which, under the facts as they understand them, would be unlawful."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "That's correct. Conspiracy intervenes at an earlier stage, Justice Stevens. The traditional Federal rule is that in an attempt, you need the intent to perform the illegal act, plus a substantial step towards its completion. The law of attempt has always required a little bit more activity on the part of the defendant before the Government can intervene and penalize it. And that's in part because of the need to have some corroborating evidence that the defendant actually did intend to carry out an illegal act and to avoid penalizing something as a thought crime."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Dreeben, the first trial in this case described a narrower conspiracy, did it not, than was involved in the second trial? And would you explain what the difference was in the conspiracy charge initially made, and the conspiracy charge in the second trial?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "Well, the conspiracy charge, Justice Ginsburg, remained the same in both. In the -- the indictment was not changed. It was a single indictment that alleged the conspirators formed an agreement at a date unknown to the grand jury, but by November 18th, 1997, to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana. In the original trial, the parties were unaware of the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States versus Cruz, which forms the basis for the legal rule that the Government challenges here. And it, therefore, proceeded on the -- what we believe to be the wholly correct theory that respondents could be held liable for joining that conspiracy on November 19th when they agreed to become couriers to move the drugs further down the road in Idaho. They did not know that the drugs had actually been seized earlier by the Government and that the Government was watching them. So the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Cruz meant that what the Government had argued in the first case no longer was sufficient to support conspiracy liability."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is -- is there a temporal component to your argument? If the initial defendants had been arrested and detained for a month and then they got around to the sting operation, would it still be a conspiracy, or does it lapse after some reasonable time?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "It doesn't lapse through a period of time, Justice Kennedy. What could cause the conspiracy to end is the conspirators' wholly abandoning pursuit of the objectives of the conspiracy. In other words, if all of the conspirators on the outside -- those who were in Arizona on the sending end and those who were on Idaho on the delivery end -- had all concluded that something has gone wrong with this shipment, the drugs have disappeared, they could have abandoned the narrowest version of the conspiracy --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But so long as one of the end delivery people didn't know about it and thought that the drugs were still on the way, he could continue to recruit people and so forth even if the principals had been in jail for a month and the drugs had been seized for a month?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",

    "speech": "Well, let's -- let's -- all right. But even those -- some couriers had -- had been in jail."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "Correct, because so long as those individuals who are involved in the conspiracy are still trying to accomplish its objective, the conspiracy is still alive. And as the -- as in the case of the Government sting where there's never any drugs in the outset, the conspiracy is impossible as a matter of fact for the conspirators to successfully accomplish. But if it is accepted that that can be a crime, where there's a Government sting at the outset, then surely the Government's intervention in midstream doesn't automatically terminate the conspiracy as a matter of law, which is what the Ninth Circuit held."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "Justice O'Connor, it would depend on whether the powdered sugar is supplied by the Government under the representation that it is cocaine, or whether the defendants are actually seeking to move powdered sugar knowing that they are seeking to move powdered sugar."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "Well, it is the same, Justice Kennedy, and -- and the uniform position in the Federal courts is that it is. That would be a mistake of fact, and when the conspirators or the person who's attempting to commit a crime has the intent to commit a crime and takes a substantial step for it, the fact that unbeknownst to him some aspect of the universe is such that he can't complete the crime does not defeat the accomplishment of the objective."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, if -- for a conspiracy conviction, I mean, because the whole -- the whole purpose is to prevent people banding together for wicked purposes, but if -- if there's no conspiracy involved and he's mistaken in the fact, I assume there's no crime."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "No. The -- the modern rule, Justice Scalia, is that there is a crime. In this country, the earliest case that addressed it and the case that all of us are familiar with from law school is People versus Jaffe, a New York Court of Appeals case from 1906. And that case did, indeed, hold -- as Justice Kennedy has described it -- that if the person is receiving what he believes to be stolen goods and the goods are not stolen, he is not liable. But the modern focus on attempt law is on the intent of the actor to commit an illegal act, and the fact that unbeknownst to him there are circumstances that prevent him from accomplishing the completed crime does not defeat his liability for an attempt. In other words, attempt law and conspiracy law have, to an extent, converged on the policy that the importance of inchoate crimes is to get at dangerous actors."

    "speech": "There -- the only thing that there is from this Court, Justice O'Connor, are two opinions that have addressed the obstruction of justice statute, Osborn versus United States and United States versus Aguilar. In both of those cases, the Court was dealing with a statute that didn't use the word attempt. It used the word endeavor. And the Court made quite clear that the impossibility of the defendant accomplishing the objective of his crime doesn't defeat liability. In Osborn, it was an individual who was attempting to bribe a juror. Unbeknownst to him, the intermediary, who he was using to pay the bribe, was working with the FBI. And of course, the bribe was not going to be paid. The juror was not going to be corrupted. And yet, the Court held that an endeavor to commit the crime is punishable."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Does the Model -- Model Penal Code take a position on this?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "Yes. The Model Penal Code goes very far in the direction of the intent-based focus of attempt law and conspiracy law. In the Model Penal Code, there is no defense for impossibility of any kind, fact or law. What the Model Penal Code does, however, is allow, in certain extreme cases that it wasn't able to craft a principle for, a power to a judge to either reduce the grade of a crime or to dismiss it. And the Model Penal Code was thinking about hypotheticals which have not come up in any cases that -- that anyone has actually found, such as where an individual believes that he can kill through incantations and voodoo and sets about to do so. Under an orthodox, doctrinaire approach to principles of attempt law, that individual has the intent to kill, and has carried out a substantial step. Many commentators have said that should not occasion liability because it's inherently impossible that the actor will achieve his goal and in reality that person is probably not a dangerous individual who warrants punishment."

    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "Only a matter of degree, Mr. Chief Justice, and for that reason, the Model Penal Code rejected a legal rule that would carve out inherent impossibility and said that it's really something that should go to whether a judge should reduce the grade of a crime or dismiss it. Our position is that that sort of --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What did the Ninth Circuit rely on in United States versus Cruz? If -- if the law is as uniform as you say it is, what -- what did they rely on? They must have relied on something."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "The Ninth Circuit, I believe, made a -- a linguistic mistake. There are an abundance of cases that say that a conspiracy ends when its goal is either accomplished or defeated, and those cases, read in context, mean that if the conspirators actually abandon their efforts to complete the crime, or all of them are arrested and they're in custody and they're really not in a position to go forward anymore, the conspiracy ends at that point. And frequently that sort of a determination is made for purposes of the admission of co-conspirator statements under 801(d)(2)(E). You want to know whether the conspiracy is alive so you can determine whether to admit post-arrest statements by one conspirator against another conspirator. And in those cases, it makes perfect sense to say that the conspiracy ended when all of the co-conspirators are arrested and have given up. The Ninth Circuit took that language -- the language referring to the defeat of the object of the conspiracy -- and took it literally, and the effect was to create a defense of factual impossibility. And the court actually used those words. It was factually impossible for the conspirators to complete their crime. Therefore, the conspiracy was over as a matter of law."

When -- when the case was charged, the parties weren't focusing on Cruz and the case was just charged in the way conspiracies normally are; namely, the grand jury alleges that the conspiracy came into existence by a particular date when it could be certain that it did come into existence. It may have come into existence earlier, and the grand jury's charge says from a date uncertain, but at least by November 18, there was a conspiracy in place and the following four individuals were -- are to be charged as co-conspirators, plus others unknown to the grand jury. Now, in light of the way the facts actually panned out at -- at the trial, and given the holdings of the Ninth Circuit that the Government failed to prove pre-seizure involvement on the part of the respondent couriers, the indictment might have more accurately been written to say that on November 18th, at least, a conspiracy was formed, and by November 19th the respondents joined it.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "I don't think so, Justice Kennedy, because the crucial aspect of a conspiracy and a defining, limiting principle is the scope of the nature of the agreement. Courts have worked out a multi-factor test to determine whether you have one agreement or two agreements. And it focuses not on literal identity of membership or complete chronological co-existence of the participation of each conspirator, but whether there's a common agreement which each is seeking to advance forward in his own way and whether the excess of one is dependent on the efforts of the others. Now, in this case, construed most narrowly, the indictment alleges a conspiracy to move drugs, staring in Phoenix, Arizona, through Las Vegas, and all the way up to Idaho and then perhaps beyond that. That is the conspiracy in which respondents were involved as substitute couriers brought in to move the truck from the Karcher Mall in Idaho to its ultimate destination. That's the same conspiracy that existed at the outset. The original couriers, had they not been arrested, would have completed the trip. So what you have is one common agreement in which all participants are working to achieve the same goal, and there is only a switch of two members, the two couriers, midstream --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But you were going back to -- I think you hadn't completed your answer to why it's okay that even though the proof as to these two defendants starts on the 19th, not on the 18th, it's okay to have the indictment say they were participants from the 18th."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, if you read the indictment as alleging that they were involved on the 18th and we didn't show that they were involved until the 19th -- and as the case comes to this Court, that's what we showed -- you have a variance between the allegations of the indictment and the proof at trial. And the settled law on variances is that it is no defense for a defendant if the proof varies from the conspiracy charged in the indictment so long as the conspiracy that's proved up is within the scope of the indictment, a lesser included conspiracy, so to speak, and the defendants suffer no prejudice from the variation. Now, in this case, everyone knew from the outset that the centerpiece of the Government's proof against respondents was going to be the observation of them driving up after the call was placed to the Arizona supplier of the drugs and getting into the truck and driving the truck away down the highway in Idaho, following which they were stopped and gave completely unbelievable stories about what they were doing driving around with a truck filled with drugs. There was no prejudice to the defendants in defending against a conspiracy that was proved up based on the events of the 18th because those events were always going to be at the heart of the Government's proof that they were liable. So absent a showing of prejudice, the variance between the allegations of the indictment and the proof at trial does not warrant any relief."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But your -- your principal argument is not in response to variance. It's simply that on the 19th they became -- excuse me -- they became part of a conspiracy that had begun at least by the 18th."

  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "That's correct."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's -- that's the essence of your position."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DREEBEN",
    "speech": "That's -- the essence of our argument is that -- and the Ninth Circuit in ruling that the evidence was insufficient did not rely on principles of variance or principles of multiple conspiracies or any other fact-based, record-based analysis that would show that the Government didn't prove the conspiracy alleged in the indictment. What the Ninth Circuit relied on was its holding in Cruz which is that a conspiracy ends when the Government intervenes and renders its completion impossible. And the Ninth Circuit, therefore, reasoned that respondents could not have joined the conspiracy alleged in the indictment because that conspiracy was, as a factual matter, over. Accordingly, the only way on the Ninth Circuit's view that the Government could win this case is if the Government showed that respondents joined the conspiracy before the seizure of the drugs, or if they were involved in a broader conspiracy that involved other drugs. Only under those two assumptions did the Ninth Circuit think that the Government could prevail. And the Ninth Circuit held that the evidence was not sufficient to prove either of those other conspiratorial activities. It never questioned that the evidence was overwhelming to prove a conspiracy to participate in the distribution of drugs on November 19th, when respondents showed up and got in the truck. And because the Ninth Circuit was wrong in its holding that a conspiracy terminates when it becomes factually impossible of accomplishment, the rest of its analysis also crumbles. I'd like to save the remainder of my time for rebuttal."

    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, counsel: Mr. Sullivan and I expect that we were not invited here to argue our view that the case below was decided on the sufficiency of the evidence question. However, having said that, we would not wish to have it taken that we abandon that argument. Mr. Chief Justice, a number of the questions posed seemed to go to the heart of what this case is about. Justice Stevens asked, what was the conspiracy that survived? The Government argues at length in the brief and here today that -- notwithstanding the charge in the indictment and the trial of this case below -- that by November 18th, 1997, Mr. Recio and Mr. Lopez-Mesa could be charged with the crime. The fact of the matter is, is that the indictment framed what this case was about by November 18th."

The -- the question was posed, What conspiracy survives, and I'm suggesting that no conspiracy survived, and that the answer is, is that the Government framed the case as they would have it and that the issues that the Government talks about here today and in their brief at length as to when the -- these two late-comers to the conspiracy enter -- came into it -- obscures that notion. Your Honor -- or Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the question posited in the -- in the petition for certiorari, with all due respect, I don't think has been really argued here much today by the Government. The -- the question is correctly whether a conspiracy ends as a matter of law when the Government frustrates its objective. That is taken from the formulation of former Chief Judge Browning in this case below that he -- all they said was -- in describing the case here and referring back to Cruz -- in Cruz we ruled that a defendant could not be charged with conspiracy to distribute illegal drugs when the defendant was brought into the drug scheme only after the law enforcement authorities had already intervened and defendant's involvement was prompted by that intervention. The Ninth Circuit didn't say that this was an impossibility case, that it was impossible for the conspiracy to continue as to other people. What the Ninth Circuit said in that case was in these circumstances -- in these limited circumstances, in Cruz and in Recio -- that given the Government intervention in the objective of the conspiracy, given the Government intervention and the invitation after that to join the conspiracy by Recio and Lopez, that they couldn't join the conspiracy.

The other, the Government says, is that the conspirators have to abandon it, not that it becomes -- there's an impediment to its completion, but abandonment by one person, if she withdraws from the conspiracy and tells the police, for example, or tells the co-conspirators. But an impediment -- another impediment -- doesn't stop the conspiracy from persisting. And the Ninth Circuit I thought pretty clearly said, Yes, it does, and that -- wasn't there rather sharp disagreement among the Ninth Circuit judges over this? They didn't treat it as a question of sufficiency of the evidence."

However, what -- the point I seek to make, not very well, apparently -- is -- is that what the court below did not say was that it was impossible to have a conspiracy, but that they added to abandonment and accomplishment a new ability to frustrate or end the conspiracy. That is Government -- and -- and narrowly. Government intervention that frustrates its objective and that Government intervention invited the new participants into it. And Justice Ginsburg, you -- you inquired as to what -- or, Justice O'Connor, as to the -- as to the -- what the Model Penal Code might say about that. And I would suggest that in that regard, Wharton, in describing that, said -- suggests that the Model Penal court -- Code suggests the position that if the conduct is, quote, \"so inherently unlikely to result or culminate in the commission of a crime that no public danger is presented warranting defendant's punishment as a conspirator.\" And I think that's what the Ninth Circuit was saying in this case, that if we look at this historical purposes of conspiracy -- and the Government has well traversed that in its briefs and its reply brief -- that the gist, the gravamen of a conspiracy is the combination that -- to agree to do something. Mr. Justice Kennedy, you inquired whether to do something that's not illegal is -- can be a conspiracy, and I suggest that that -- that's part of what brings us here is the confusion as to when you can and cannot and ought not have a conspiracy."

You can say, well, you know, That's a harmless conspiracy, but a conspiracy to rob a bank is not harmless. These are bad people, and if they don't do this bank, they may do another bank.

You can only find him guilty of the conspiracy if he joined it prior to 1:18 a.m. on November 18th. On the other hand, if you find there's a larger conspiracy, you can find him guilty, but that larger conspiracy must be to distribute other drugs than those that were seized. So I -- I suppose the proof doesn't support either of those conspiracies."

The evidence was just simply insufficient to sustain the conviction for either the single load or the multi-load before November 18th."

We would suggest simply that that's the obligation of the prosecutors now. Cruz doesn't add any burdens to the prosecutorial responsibility. Thank you."

    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To address the jury instruction issue first, the jury in this case was instructed in accordance with the requirements of Cruz, and therefore, the jury was asked to find whether there was evidence of respondents' involvement in the conspiracy before the seizure of the drugs or, alternatively, whether they were involved in a broader conspiracy, not limited to the drugs that were seized. At pages 6 through 8 of our reply brief at the petition stage, we addressed the consequences of what happens if this Court should conclude that the Cruz legal rule is incorrect. And in essence, our position is that any rational jury that found guilt under the Cruz instructions also would have found that respondents were involved in a conspiracy to distribute the very drugs that they drove to the Karcher Mall to pick up. That was the centerpiece of the Government's evidence, that respondents were involved in a conspiracy, and the fact that the jury may have found that respondents were involved in a longer conspiracy, or in other conspiracies wouldn't detract from the rationality of its necessarily concluding that the respondents were also involved in this conspiracy. Even if this Court didn't agree with that rationale or chose not to reach it, it's important to note that the effect of the Ninth Circuit's holding is to find insufficient evidence to prove the crime charged in the indictment. That doesn't leave the Government with the option of pursuing a new trial on correct instructions with the Cruz findings purged from them. It would mean that respondents have permanent immunity from the crime that's charged in the indictment. If this Court were to conclude that Cruz is wrong, and either this Court or the Ninth Circuit also concluded that the jury instructions somehow prejudiced the defendants, the remedy would be a new trial. It is also important, I believe, to note that the -- the principle that the Ninth Circuit has adopted would go contrary to what this Court has noted about the evolution of conspiracies. In a case called Blumenthal versus United States, which we did not cite in our briefs, but it appears at 332 U.S. 539, the Court noted that conspiracies involving elaborate arrangements generally are not born full-grown. Rather, they mature by successive stages which are necessary to bring in the essential parties. And in this case, two essential parties were brought in not at the inception of the conspiracy, but after events that the conspirators were aware of required that new couriers were brought in. They were not aware that the Government had seized the drugs, but they knew that they needed new couriers. They brought them in. Under the principles of Blumenthal, that's all one conspiracy. Respondents' counsel has mentioned the Model Penal Code provisions. The Model Penal Code at section 5.01 addresses the question of impossibility under attempt law and concludes that the defense should not be recognized and at section 5.03 does the same for conspiracy. Finally -- thank you."
