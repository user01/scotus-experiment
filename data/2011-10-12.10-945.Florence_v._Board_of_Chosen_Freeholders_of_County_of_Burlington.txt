1 2 PROCEEDINGS 3 (10:02 a.m.) 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 5 first this morning in Case 10-945, Florence v. The Board 6 of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington. 7 Mr. Goldstein. 8 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 10 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it 11 please the Court: 12 We ask this Court to hold that a jail may 13 strip search an arrestee in cases of reasonable 14 suspicion. That is the rule that was applied throughout 15 almost the entire country in the three decades after 16 Bell v. Wolfish, without either administrative 17 difficulty or any apparent increase in smuggling. We're 18 here today, of course, because both the Burlington Jail 19 and the Essex County Jail require every arrestee to 20 stand 2 feet in front of a correctional officer and 21 strip naked. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you apply the 23 reasonable suspicion rule to all arrestees? I thought 24 you were making a distinction between felons and less 25 serious offenders.

1 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We do apply it to all 2 arrestees. The Respondents and the U.S. Bureau of 3 Prisons do draw a line at major versus minor offenders. 4 I think they do that because they think that people who 5 commit more serious crimes might be inclined to greater 6 criminality. But our rule is one of reasonable 7 suspicion. Our question presented draws a line at minor 8 offenders because this class definition is only people 9 who were arrested for minor offenses. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the reasonable 11 suspicion test more easily met if it's a felon detained 12 for a serious felony? 13 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It is in the view of the 14 courts that have considered this question, absolutely. 15 In our view - 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In your -- in your view? 17 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Yes, and, in fact - 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then you are going 19 on a case-by-case basis based on the offense. 20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The category -- there is a 21 categorical rule, and that is -- that was adopted by 22 these Respondents, by the Bureau of Prisons, and four 23 court of appeals, that says if you were arrested for a 24 more serious offense, categorically there exists 25 reasonable suspicion.

1 Our case-by-case rule, it's true, applies 2 with respect to minor offenders. And, again, that's the 3 class that was defined here. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how would this work 5 with respect to individuals who have been arrested for 6 serious offenses? Let's say someone has been arrested 7 for -- for assault. Say it's a case of domestic 8 violence, assault. Would that be enough to justify a 9 search? 10 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I think you will have to 11 ask -- I know you want me to answer the question. Let 12 me just be very clear. This is their rule. The 13 Respondents draw the major/minor offense line. The 14 Respondents apply a reasonable suspicion standard. Now, 15 in my view - 16 JUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand. You say 17 that you don't want to draw that line; you want to apply 18 it to - 19 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 20 JUSTICE ALITO: -- to everybody, and I'm 21 asking you whether the mere fact that someone has been 22 arrested for a violent offense would in your judgment be 23 sufficient to provide reasonable suspicion. 24 MR. GOLDSTEIN: If the jail made that 25 judgment, we would think that a court would not overturn
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that judgment. We think that illustrates that, by 2 contrast to when someone is arrested for not paying a 3 fine, that there is no justification whatsoever, because 4 the logic of their own policy is that this is a person 5 who's inclined to violence - 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I take it -- I take it 7 what we're trying to do is to protect the individual 8 dignity of the detainee. But it seems to me that you 9 risk compromising that individual dignity if you say we 10 have reasonable suspicion as to you, but not as to you. 11 You're just setting us up, and you're setting the 12 detainee up for a classification that may be questioned 13 at the time and will be seen as an affront based on the 14 person's race, based on what he said or she said to the 15 officers coming in. 16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so, it seems to me 18 that your rule imperils individual dignity in a way that 19 the blanket rule does not. 20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, a couple of points, 21 Justice Kennedy. I think it's an incredibly important 22 issue. They don't have a blanket rule. Remember, the 23 Respondents apply a reasonable suspicion standard. They 24 do strip everyone naked, but if they're going to look 25 for contraband -- that is, look at the person's mouth,
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 look at their anus -- they apply a reasonable suspicion 2 standard. 3 Now, to your very serious concern that maybe 4 we are inviting discrimination or at least an appearance 5 of discrimination, remember that their rule is going to 6 produce more of that problem than ours, because their 7 rule is not that they have to strip search -- they have 8 to strip search everyone for contraband, but their rule 9 is they can. They can make a choice. 10 This Court in the Fourth -- they say we - 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure if it's 12 their rule or our rule. Ultimately, it's going to be 13 our rule. 14 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, okay. Well, then - 15 (Laughter.) 16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: First let me say I hope not. 17 I hope that your rule is that there has to be a 18 reasonable suspicion standard, which is the rule that 19 was applied almost everywhere in the wake of 20 Bell v. Wolfish, without - 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: To do -- to do what? 22 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You just said that strip 24 naked is different from a strip search. 25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, exactly.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, what is permitted? 2 There are various things. One is showering in the 3 presence of officers? 4 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Showering in the presence of 5 officers is not something that requires reasonable 6 suspicion. The courts have uniformly concluded that if 7 you are just generally in an area in which you're being 8 monitored by the officers, that's not a Fourth Amendment 9 search that violates a reasonable expectation of 10 privacy. This is different. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They -- they can be 12 inspected without their clothes; just nothing more than 13 that? 14 MR. GOLDSTEIN: There are two different 15 scenarios. One is a common room where everyone is 16 standing around, and for jail security purposes - 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: A common? 18 MR. GOLDSTEIN: A common room, a common 19 shower area. And, of course, for security purposes. 20 This is different, Justice Ginsburg. You 21 asked what's prohibited in the absence of reasonable 22 suspicion. What's prohibited is standing 2 feet away 23 from the person - 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I want to know what's 25 permitted.

Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, what is permitted is 2 anything -- what is not subject to a reasonable 3 suspicion standard is anything other than looking at - 4 a close inspection of the person at arm's length. What 5 the courts of appeals have uniformly recognized, in the 6 lower Federal courts, what the literature recognizes and 7 really what I think concerned this Court in the Safford 8 case is that when you are standing so close to the 9 person inspecting their genitals, looking directly at 10 their most private parts of their bodies, that is a 11 direct intrusion on their individual privacy - 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Are you 13 --are you suggesting three different levels? Stripping 14 naked: It's okay to stand 5 feet away, but not 2? 15 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't think that the 16 courts have had to confront 5 feet versus 2 feet. What 17 they have confronted is they acknowledge that jails are 18 places that require security. And so, if you're just 19 observing a shower room, that does not implicate a 20 reasonable expectation of privacy. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, are you 22 -- are you taking the position that it's the purpose of 23 the search - 24 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, I'm taking - 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that's at issue?
9

1 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, it's the closeness of 2 it. There is not a problem, I think, with the question 3 of 2, 3, 4, or 5 feet. These searches all occur in the 4 same way, and that is the officer stands directly in 5 front of you. The testimony here is 2 feet away. That 6 seems to be the common - 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm still - 8 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- unsure if it's okay 10 to shower - 11 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and have an officer 13 watch you shower naked. 14 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is -- the greater 16 intrusion is that you're standing 2 as opposed to 5 feet 17 away? 18 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Two versus 10 feet away or 19 just generally observing the room. This is exactly - 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. If that's a 21 line, that doesn't make much sense to me. 22 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then let's go to the 24 next line, which is -- that's one kind of search. 25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.
10

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The second is I think 2 what some have called a visual cavity search. 3 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Whether you're going to 5 have the individual open or expose private parts. 6 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you make an argument 8 that that's different than just a visual search? 9 MR. GOLDSTEIN: You can. So, let me just 10 say -- let me just try and close off my answer to the 11 question of the 5 versus 10 feet and then turn 12 immediately to this visual body cavity search. 13 Remember, this is -- the Court will recall 14 that this is a reprise of the argument in the Safford 15 case, where the schools there argued that, well, there's 16 an observation of these students in gym class, they 17 shower together naked, they undress naked. And the 18 Court said it's quite different when you're standing 19 right there looking over the student. Now, as to -- and 20 said that's what implicates a Fourth Amendment right of 21 privacy, and the distinction did make sense. 22 As to your question, yes, there is a 23 material difference, we think, although we think both 24 should be covered by our rule. But a visual body cavity 25 inspection as occurred in the Essex facility here, where
11

Alderson Reporting Company

1 you require someone to bend over and cough, which is 2 what the testimony is in this case - 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One, not the other? 4 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct. 5 That -- the second jail had a slightly 6 different search protocol, in which the testimony is 7 that he was required to bend over and cough and expose 8 his anus for inspection. And the Respondents themselves 9 regard that as a more significant intrusion, and they 10 apply a reasonable suspicion standard themselves to 11 that. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Goldstein, what -- what 13 you propose is reasonable enough, I suppose, and some 14 States could adopt that kind of a protocol instead of 15 what they have. But what you're asserting is that the 16 Fourth Amendment prohibits them from adopting it, and 17 the obstacle I see is that at the time the Fourth 18 Amendment was adopted, this -- this was standard 19 practice, to strip search people who were admitted to 20 prisons. So, how could it be deemed an unreasonable 21 invasion of privacy when it -- when it was done all the 22 time and nobody thought it was unconstitutional? 23 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We don't believe that the 24 premise is correct. If you read history differently 25 than me, I'm not going to be able to persuade you. But
12

Alderson Reporting Company

1 our understanding of the history is that the closest 2 they can come to is two things: First, that people were 3 strip searched upon arrest, and that's certainly not the 4 rule under the Fourth Amendment; and that in certain 5 jails at the time of the founding, other inmates in a 6 process of ablution, what is almost kind of a ritual 7 cleansing, would strip search new inmates. It had 8 nothing to do with the jail officials themselves or 9 trying to intercept contraband. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: That is somehow less of an 11 intrusion - 12 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's just a - 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- on your privacy, to be 14 naked in front of a whole bunch of inmates, rather than 15 one jail official inspecting? 16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, first, it wasn't a 17 nearly -- the nearly uniform practice that I think your 18 question assumes. And it's just a different kettle of 19 fish entirely, that -- we don't believe, obviously, that 20 that historical lesson obtains today, that the prisoners 21 can strip search new inmates as they -- new arrestees as 22 they come in. 23 I do agree with the basic premise of your 24 question that it's -- our position can't just be that, 25 hey, I've got a reasonable rule. I do have to, in

1 either under the terms of Bell v. Wolfish or 2 Turner v. Safley, establish that this is an exaggerated 3 response, that this is much more, materially more than 4 is necessary to accomplish their goals. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But less intrusive than 6 the one -- the search in Bell v. Wolfish, which involved 7 pretrial detainees? 8 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Ginsburg, we 9 disagree with that. At least as to the second search, 10 we think that there is no difference between the degree 11 of intrusion here and in Bell. But there is another 12 significant reason that this -- not just in the nature 13 of the search, but a big difference between this case 14 and Bell is that the inmates in that case made a 15 voluntary choice. They decided to have the contact 16 visits that was - 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know if the 18 pretrial detainees in Bell were also inspected on entry 19 into the facility? 20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We do not. I tried 21 everything I could to check the record of that case, and 22 there was no record of an admission strip search at the 23 MCC at the time. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, is there - 25 there is a distinction between the simple strip search
14

1 and the visual body cavity search. You say that they 2 apply reasonable suspicion standard to the visual body 3 cavity search. 4 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, is the visual 6 cavity search therefore off the table? 7 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, it is not. We contend 8 that the Fourth Amendment prohibited the visual body 9 cavity search at the Essex facility. So - 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, right. But 11 you would say that they had to have a reasonable 12 articulable suspicion before they could do that? 13 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We say that under their 14 written policy, they should have, but they didn't. The 15 Burlington County -- the only evidence about a 16 conclusion of the jail about reasonable suspicion is 17 that the Burlington County intake officer filled out a 18 form saying there is no reasonable suspicion here. And 19 Essex I don't believe contends that there was reasonable 20 suspicion to engage in a visual body cavity search. 21 They deny, as a matter of fact, that it happened. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so, you see a 23 distinction between what they actually do and the 24 written policy. 25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I do with respect to the
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Essex -- I apologize -- no. What happened here is that 2 Essex, after this search occurred -- and this is 3 described in the Essex brief in opposition, in case you 4 want to look at it later, at 3 in note 1. Essex, after 5 the search in this case, changed its policy. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 7 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We were denied an injunction 8 going forward under L.A. v. Lyons. So, we -- it's just 9 a question of damages for the search that occurred at 10 the time under their old policy. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm confused about your - 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I - 13 JUSTICE ALITO: -- your position. Suppose a 14 jurisdiction has the policy of requiring every inmate 15 who is arrested and is going to be held in custody to 16 disrobe and take a shower and apply medication for the 17 prevention of the spread of lice and is observed while 18 this is taking place from some distance by a corrections 19 officer, let's say 10 feet away. Is that -- does that 20 require reasonable suspicion? 21 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It does not. The -- and - 22 and - 23 JUSTICE ALITO: And so, your -- your only 24 concern is searches that go further than that. 25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's exactly right. The
16

1 very close inspection of the individual's genitals, 2 which can occur absolutely so long as there is some 3 minimal level of suspicion that's created. 4 I do want to return to Justice Kennedy's 5 concern about dignitary interests here and whether 6 drawing any sort - 7 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there -- could I just 8 follow up on that? Is there a dispute of fact as to 9 whether anything beyond that occurred in Burlington 10 County? 11 MR. GOLDSTEIN: In Burlington County, there 12 is a dispute about the so-called genital lift, whether 13 Mr. Florence was required to lift his genitals or not. 14 There is no dispute that he was required directly in 15 front of an officer to strip naked, despite the officer 16 having made a finding, which is on page 390 of the joint 17 appendix, that there was no reasonable suspicion to 18 conduct a strip search. That is the only factual 19 dispute - 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel - 21 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- in the entire case. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you clarify two 23 points for me? The first is, was he admitted into the 24 general population at Burlington? 25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The record is not entirely
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 clear. What the record says is that for the first few 2 days of his stay -- remember, he inexplicably was kept 3 for 6 days. For the first several days, he was kept in 4 a cell with only one other inmate, or possibly two, and 5 one time he had lunch with other people. In Essex, he 6 was admitted to the general population. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The prior charge against 8 your client was the use -- involved the use of a deadly 9 weapon. Assuming the prison knew this, wouldn't that 10 provide the reasonable suspicion that you argue was 11 missing? 12 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, because it depends - 13 because of the breadth of the phrase "possession of a 14 deadly weapon," as this case illustrates. The record 15 shows that the possession of the deadly weapon -- and 16 that's why this charge was not pursued by the State - 17 is -- was that he was pulled over at a traffic stop and 18 he drove away. The deadly weapon is the car in this - 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, now you're feeding 20 into your adversaries' arguments that what you're asking 21 the police to do on intake, or the corrections facility 22 on intake, is to investigate in that fine detail. They 23 can't even look at the rap sheet - 24 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No - 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and see use of a
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 deadly weapon and say, ah, this guy could be dangerous? 2 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Sotomayor. The 3 rap sheet does not contain that charge. What the rap 4 sheet does show -- and we are perfectly fine with them 5 looking at the rap sheet. The rap sheet -- and it's in 6 the joint appendix. The rap sheet says that he had a 7 single charge, he pleaded guilty, he got a term of 8 probation. There is nothing about that the jail would 9 have had any information suggesting that he had some 10 charge involving a deadly weapon. And that's why they 11 themselves certified that there was no reasonable 12 suspicion. 13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is the rap sheet 14 always available immediately? I thought it was rather 15 common -- correct me if I'm wrong -- just based on 16 practice some years ago, that it -- it would take maybe 17 24 hours, 48 hours for the wiretap -- for the wire 18 services and the Internet to -- to report that he was 19 wanted for questioning for some very, very serious crime 20 in some other State. 21 I mean, in my practice at least, county 22 jails were much more dangerous than penitentiaries, 23 because you don't know who these people are. You arrest 24 them for traffic, and it may be some serial killer. You 25 do not know.
19

1 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. First, that is not 2 the view of the jails in this case. Remember, they 3 apply a reasonable suspicion standard. They did not 4 find any concern in their own policies, neither does the 5 Marshals Service, ICE, with this prospect of some prior 6 offense. 7 As to what the rule is and how common it is 8 and whether this works in practice, the jail here did 9 look him up in the New Jersey Criminal Justice 10 Information System. That's in the record. They're 11 required by New Jersey law to do that. It's a -- every 12 single one of these jails has computer access to the 13 NJ CJIS, and also to the NCIC; they just type in his 14 identifying information. 15 They were able to pull him up without any 16 difficulty, and they have not complained that they 17 didn't have enough information about him. They filled 18 out a form saying there is no reasonable suspicion here. 19 And remember, our rule only operates in a system, 20 Justice Kennedy, in which the jail does have enough 21 information. When -- our point is this: If the jail 22 has the facts, as it did here, to affirmatively 23 determine that there is no reasonable suspicion, which 24 is what they decided about Mr. Florence, then it is an 25 extraordinary intrusion on dignity and autonomy to strip
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 him naked - 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel - 3 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- when they have no reason 4 to do so. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, my 6 understanding of the statistics -- and correct me if I'm 7 wrong -- is that they get about 70 new people going 8 through this process a day. Is there anything in the 9 record about how much additional time it would require 10 to look at each one, to look at their record, to 11 determine which category they should fall into, to strip 12 search or not, as opposed to having a blanket rule? 13 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. There is because they 14 do this already. They -- it is not an administrative 15 problem. They apply our rule today. Remember, 16 Mr. Chief Justice, when he arrived at the Burlington 17 County Jail, they did an assessment of him and 18 determined that there was no reasonable suspicion. The 19 jails in this case did pull up his prior criminal 20 history, and they have no problem doing that. They 21 apply our standard today. It is not a difficult one. 22 But - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Goldstein, you -- YOU 24 have acknowledged that we have held that when you have 25 visitors, you may be strip -- strip searched after the
21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 visit and the same kind of close examination that you 2 object to here. Now, your explanation why that is okay 3 is that that is voluntary. 4 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I have two explanations. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: That you don't have to have 6 visitors. Can you really condition your -- your having 7 visitors on your waiver of your Fourth Amendment rights? 8 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Block establishes that 9 you have no right whatsoever to have contact visits. 10 So, under Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, of course, you can 11 say I voluntarily relinquish my Fourth Amendment right 12 in exchange for this privilege. 13 But I have a second - 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are -- are you sure about 15 that? 16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I - 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: You can -- you can 18 condition certain -- certain privileges upon a waiver 19 of constitutional privileges? 20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, I believe that 21 that's -- I think that's a fair statement of the law. 22 I do have a second point, though, and that 23 is that the principal reason underlying 24 Bell v. Wolfish's holding that those searches were 25 reasonable is that it was essential to deter smuggling,
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 and that deterrence rationale has much more of an 2 attenuated relationship to this case. 3 Remember that the inmate in that case was 4 having a planned meeting with someone, and the 5 representation of the government is that our problem is 6 if you plan to have somebody come visit you and you're 7 going to have a contact visit, you can plan for them to 8 try and sneak something to you. This Court has set - 9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Goldstein, there, of 10 course, were guards there who were watching the visits. 11 And, as I understand that case, there was really no 12 empirical evidence that smuggling came about as a result 13 of these visits. 14 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, can I just read to you 15 what the Court said about that? Just so -- the Court 16 did have a slightly different take, I think. And this 17 is from page 559 of the Court's opinion: "That there 18 has been only one instance where an MCC inmate was 19 discovered attempting to smuggle contraband into the 20 institution on his person may be more a testament to the 21 effectiveness of the search technique as a deterrent 22 than to any lack of interest on the part of the inmate 23 to secrete and import such items when the opportunity 24 arises." 25 And our point is that that -- when you have
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 an unexpected arrest here -- remember, Mr. Florence 2 showed the paperwork that he was not wanted for arrest. 3 And that's going to be generally true in all kinds of 4 traffic stops and the like - 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, which is it you're 6 doing? I mean, I imagine -- I thought you were saying 7 you always need reasonable suspicion. So, I imagine a 8 case where the person is going to be arrested, put into 9 the general prison population. There is a warrant out 10 against him for second-degree murder, and the policeman 11 stopping him for a traffic offense arrests him because 12 he knows he is wanted on a warrant in another place. 13 And the jail has a policy that says when you're -- come 14 in here because of second-degree murder, we strip search 15 you. Okay? Can they do that under your rule or not? 16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: That's all they know. 18 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. That's reasonable 19 suspicion. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: Then you do not want to - 21 then you are not saying it always has to be reasonable 22 suspicion. 23 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's just a debate about 24 words. We think that is reasonable suspicion. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, all right. Well, that

GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: What helps me is to know 4 what the category of things is that the jail in your 5 opinion is going to have to look into the 6 characteristics of this individual person, and when I 7 look at the ABA, they talk about minor arrests. 8 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: And when I look at some of 10 the cases, there's a long list, like violence, drugs, 11 and so forth, where you don't have to, where you can 12 just use a general -- the fact that he was arrested - 13 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: -- for the thing. But there 15 are other ones, minor ones, where you do. So, what's 16 your rule on that? 17 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Our rule that we would 18 accept is that, with respect to minor offenders, that's 19 when you assess - 20 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then the next 21 question which we'll get - 22 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: -- who is a minor offender 24 and how do you administer that rule? 25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. I think that is a
25

1 great question for them, because that's their rule. 2 They have a rule that says for minor offenders that you 3 have to have reasonable suspicion to search for 4 contraband. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are trying to 6 state the constitutional rule, and you keep talking 7 about what is their rule, and we're trying to find out 8 what are the limits - 9 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- of the rule, and I 11 think you've already qualified what you said opening. 12 Opening, you said reasonable suspicion is the rule for 13 everyone, the felon as well as the minor offenders. Now 14 you seem to be saying, well, this case involves only 15 minor offenders; so, let's limit it to that. That's 16 what I thought you were saying now. 17 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, that's right. Because 18 this case only involves minor offenders, we have 19 articulated a rule with respect to minor offenders. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. That's what 21 I'm - 22 MR.

1 JUSTICE BREYER: How do you want us to write 2 this so that jail personnel all over the country - 3 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: -- have to be able to 5 follow it and know exactly what they're supposed to do. 6 MR. GOLDSTEIN: For three decades the rule 7 that was articulated by the Federal courts and applied 8 without difficulty is one that says for minor offenses. 9 When that was applied in practice it was basically done 10 at a felony versus misdemeanor line. The court accepted 11 that if you are -- the courts accepted that if you are 12 suspected of a more serious offense, then for 13 administrative reasons and because we just think you 14 might be engaged in more criminality, then you don't 15 have to have any individualized inquiry whatsoever. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: I can understand that -- I 17 can understand that for cavity searches, but -- but why 18 for the search to see that -- if the person has any 19 fleas or cooties or, you know, any -- any other 20 communicable disease before he's put into the general 21 population? Are -- are felons more likely to have those 22 than non-felons? 23 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, they are not. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, that line makes no 25 sense for that aspect of the search which is -- is just

1 we want to make sure that we have a clean prison. 2 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is not correct. That 3 aspect -- what the testimony in this case establishes is 4 that the jail guards allow any sort of medical rationale 5 for the search to be conducted by medical personnel, not 6 by the guards themselves. All these inmates are 7 examined by a medical person, a nurse or the like, and 8 they are responsible for -- for - 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that -- that's where 10 the Fourth Amendment invasion of privacy line is to be 11 drawn? If you're examined close up by someone who has a 12 medical degree, it's okay? And, on the other hand, if 13 it's someone who does not have a medical degree, it's 14 not okay? 15 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: That can't be the line as 17 to whether your privacy is being invaded. 18 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It -- it can be the line, 19 and it is the line that's been accepted for decades. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even for - 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you -- you would - 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- body lice? 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- have to keep the person 24 in custody, say, for 24 or 48 hours until the medical 25 personnel could come. Do you have 24-hour medical

1 personnel for intakes that are at 2 in the morning? 2 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. The intake process, 3 the testimony is that - 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they are - 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're telling us that 6 every county jail in -- in the United States has medical 7 personnel on duty 24 hours a day ready to do a -- a 8 search? 9 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, I apologize, 10 Justice Kennedy. I'm telling you what's in the record 11 in this case. And that is - 12 JUSTICE BREYER: You said before was 2 feet 13 is too close, but 5 feet is okay. Are you sticking with 14 that? 15 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, I'm saying 16 that a close inspection which is intended to examine the 17 person's individual - 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 19 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- genitals, and whether 20 it's at 2 feet or 4 feet I don't think is the relevant 21 line. 22 If I could make one point, and then reserve 23 the remainder of my time, that that - 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just ask, on your 25 medical personnel, children in school get inspected for

1 -- for head lice, prisoners for body lice. You don't 2 need a doctor to do that? 3 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, that's right, but if 4 that is right, what happens is that medical 5 professionals are the people who are assigned that 6 responsibility. That's the testimony in this case. The 7 only last point that I wanted to make is - 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not 9 constitutionally required. 10 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I -- I agree. That - 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, that's another thing 12 that -- that you don't need to -- they can inspect for 13 body lice, and that's -- that's okay? 14 MR. GOLDSTEIN: If that's what they're 15 doing, I think that that is okay. The courts have said 16 that that is not itself a -- because of the prospect of 17 handling that problem with shampoo, which is what these 18 jails do, that that's not a sufficient -- a sufficient 19 justification to require the person to strip naked. 20 The only other point that I did want to make 21 is that this is the rule, not just at Burlington and 22 Essex, but also of the U.S. Marshals Service, which has 23 the intake of 220,000 inmates every year, and also of 24 the Bureau of Immigration Customs Enforcement, which 25 intakes 384,000 a year.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Government tells 2 us that that's true only if they don't put the arrestee 3 in the general population. 4 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's not correct. That is 5 only the policy of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, which has 6 an intake of minor offenders of only a few thousand 7 people a year. For the Marshals Service and for ICE, 8 which have a combined 600,000 people every year, they do 9 not have that separate housing rule. 10 If I could reserve the remainder of my time. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll give you 12 rebuttal time, but maybe just to be clear - 13 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you don't -- do 15 you or do you not have an objection to the superseding 16 ECCF policy? 17 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We -- if the -- we do, 18 because they still have to stand naked directly in front 19 of the correctional officer under the superseding 20 policy. What the superseding policy is, which is 21 Burlington's policy throughout this, is that they will 22 not search the person for contraband, which is their 23 supposed interest here, for contraband, in the absence 24 of reasonable suspicion. 25 Both jails at the time of this search and

1 also now will still require the person to strip naked, 2 supposedly for contraband, even though their own policy 3 says we won't search for -- we won't engage in the depth 4 of search that's required, we won't look at the anus, we 5 won't look in the person's mouth, in the absence of 6 reasonable suspicion. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the current 8 policy? 9 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is the current policy. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you have no 11 problem with that. 12 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We do have -- I - 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, you have no 14 problem with the reasonable, articulable suspicion 15 aspect of the body cavity search. 16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. And with 18 respect to the simple strip search - 19 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- your only 21 objection is that the guard is too close to the inmate? 22 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 2 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 3 and may it please the Court: 4 I actually appreciate the clarification that 5 your questions brought to this case, because I think 6 there's a bit of confusion that I'd like to try to clear 7 up, although my -- my colleague's movement in terms of 8 answering some of the questions left me a little bit 9 perplexed as to exactly what the nature of their claims 10 are. 11 The -- the first question that it seems to 12 me the Court should focus on is what policy is at issue 13 here. And, obviously, since the class certification 14 deals with one set of issues and the plaintiff's claims 15 deal with another set of issues, I think you have to be 16 careful. 17 I think you have to focus on the policies 18 that existed in 2005. That was the basis on which he 19 was in fact searched under these circumstances. And the 20 policy in Burlington was that -- was primarily aimed, 21 frankly, at health and tattoos, and the policy at Essex 22 was aimed primarily at contraband and then secondarily 23 at tattoos and health. 24 And the policy at Burlington was largely 25 a -- you come into prison, you give up your clothes,
33

1 they look through your clothes, you take a shower, they 2 examine you fairly cursorily, but look at you, and then 3 -- then give you prison garb and move along your way. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Is the 5 shower and look at you cursorily -- are those separate 6 things? Or is it during the shower? 7 MR. PHILLIPS: It -- it's before or during. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because your friend 9 places a lot of significance on how close - 10 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the examination 12 is. So, under that policy, how close was the 13 examination? 14 MR. PHILLIPS: It almost certainly would 15 have been about an arm's length, because at that -- I 16 mean, the problem is if you're exchanging clothes with 17 somebody, you're handing them clothes to change into, 18 it's sort of hard to be longer than arm's length and 19 actually get the clothes into his hand. So that - 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Two arms' lengths. I mean, 21 he could reach out, right? 22 MR. PHILLIPS: Okay. Two arms' lengths. 23 (Laughter.) 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not 25 right. They could take -

1 MR. PHILLIPS: But I'm not - 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not right. 3 You could take the clothes off, put them in a bin - 4 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The person examines 6 the bin. 7 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And that's actually 8 what they do in Essex. In Essex, they do it that way. 9 The difference between Essex is that Essex, in fact, 10 does have -- I mean, part of the problem is 11 terminological, all right? 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 13 MR. PHILLIPS: You know, Burlington is 14 basically a body visual observation, and the district 15 court said that's unconstitutional, that just observing 16 at all is unconstitutional. 17 To some extent, it seems to me my -- my 18 friend here has given up that part of the district 19 court's decision, which -- then clearly the court of 20 appeals, to the extent it reversed that part, ought to 21 be affirmed on that ground alone. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: Visual observation from 23 more than 2 feet, or less than 2 feet? 24 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, although that -- that 25 was not the district court's theory. The district court
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 didn't say 2 to 3 feet. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What happened? Do 3 we know? Was the search within 2 feet or not within 2 4 feet? 5 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it depends on whose 6 version of it. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: We don't know. 8 MR. PHILLIPS: You have to remember, the 9 district court granted summary judgment to the plaintiff 10 in this case. So, you would have to -- you would have 11 to interpret -- you'd have to give us the benefit of the 12 interpretation, which was that it was more than 2 feet. 13 But the court of appeals reversed, of 14 course, without regard to that, because the court of 15 appeals said, look, if you -- if you apply this Court's 16 decision in Bell v. Wolfish, it doesn't matter, because 17 you can engage in a much more intrusive true body cavity 18 search, which frankly is more intrusive than even what 19 Essex County asks -- has -- does in this case, because 20 he wasn't asked to bend over and to -- and to have a 21 body cavity anal search. What he was asked to do was to 22 squat and cough, in the event that -- because ordinarily 23 that will cause the contraband then to fall out, and you 24 can -- and you can catch it under those circumstances. 25 So, this is -- that's sort of the context in
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 which this issue comes up. 2 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, if I could 3 understand your position, you think that there's no 4 reasonable suspicion even for that more intrusive body 5 cavity search; is that right? 6 MR. PHILLIPS: That's correct. That's my - 7 that's the rule of law I'm asking for. 8 JUSTICE KAGAN: And does it matter to you 9 whether the person is being introduced into the general 10 prison population, or would you also say that if the 11 person is not being introduced into the general prison 12 population? Do you still think that there's no 13 reasonable suspicion requirement? 14 MR. PHILLIPS: I would say, from my 15 perspective, I think even -- even if they weren't going 16 to be admitted into the general prison population, 17 because the risks remain too substantial. But the truth 18 is I don't have to defend that argument, because both - 19 both of these jails admit the -- their inmates into the 20 -- into the general population 99.9 percent of the time. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would a manual search - 22 MR. PHILLIPS: So, that's not a line we 23 draw. 24 JUSTICE ALITO: Would you say that 25 regardless of the offense for which the person is
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 arrested? There have been some stories in the news 2 recently about cities that have taken to arresting 3 people for traffic citations. So, suppose someone is 4 just arrested because they have a lot of tickets for 5 being caught on speed cameras, let's say. That person 6 can be subjected to the searches that you're describing? 7 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Alito. I think 8 the basic principle we're asking for is that deference 9 to the jails and -- and to the administrators of the 10 jails requires that this Court respect their judgment 11 that you can't make a distinction based on that specific 12 individual; that whether somebody is a minor offender or 13 a major offender, one, is never all that clear in the 14 first place, and, two, isn't a basis on which to 15 distinguish the risks that it poses to the - 16 JUSTICE BREYER: Try the ABA. The ABA is 17 minor offenses, not drugs, not violence, and there you 18 have to have reasonable suspicion. Now, I've read 19 through the briefs, and I can't find a lot of 20 contrabanders that were caught in that category. In 21 fact, my law clerk thinks it's one out of 64,000 or 22 less. So -- so, what is the justification for a rule to 23 avoid reasonable suspicion in that category? 24 MR. PHILLIPS: If -- if you look at the 25 expert testimony that was before the court, in the
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 district court in this case, both the expert testimony 2 of the plaintiff and the expert testimony of the 3 defendant -- this is at 348a of the joint appendix. It 4 says "a greater presence of contraband amongst those 5 individuals that have minor offenses." That's his - 6 that's their expert's characterization, that minor 7 offenders bring in more contraband than major offenders. 8 Our experts said misdemeanants can be more dangerous and 9 more likely to bring in contraband - 10 JUSTICE BREYER: It's a conclusion - 11 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and we have a lot of 13 practical experience because different States have 14 different rules, and San Francisco came in with I think 15 the toughest on your side, for your side. I just say, 16 looking through that, it's very hard to find somebody 17 who really was in this minor offender category, who 18 really was found to have contraband. So, what should I 19 look at to show that my initial reaction from a quick 20 reading is wrong. 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean - 22 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, do I just say this 23 is a - 24 MR. PHILLIPS: -- I think you can go back to 25 Bell v. Wolfish, where this Court said that the fact
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that there is not a lot of contraband being found may be 2 a testament to the effectiveness of the deterrent. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why do we change the 4 policy? In Bell, we found that the policy was 5 successful. Even though there were searches, contraband 6 still got in. So, virtually every circuit -- in 7 practice, the Federal system -- have been following this 8 reasonable suspicion for minor crimes, and they've been 9 fairly successful. So, why do we change the 10 constitutional rule to let them do more? 11 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think that - 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To invade more. 13 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, I think, first 14 of all, anybody who thinks that the problems of 15 contraband are less serious today than they were in 1978 16 is -- is ignoring reality. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I understand 18 contraband is serious, but most of the studies point to 19 it not being on intake, but coming in through guards, 20 coming in through contact visits. 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The great cause today is 23 that from corrupt correction officials. 24 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, we can debate 25 that. But, Justice Sotomayor, it seems to me that the
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 -- that the fundamental principle that ought to 2 undergird the entirety of the Court's analysis here 3 comes out of Turner v. Safley and that line of cases, 4 where - 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could I ask you 6 something just in terms of your rule? I think your 7 brief says your rule is you're not entitled 8 constitutionally to any right of privacy in prison. 9 MR. PHILLIPS: No. 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If that's the case, are 11 you saying that if the prisons decide on a manual 12 search, every prisoner who comes in, correction officers 13 can manually check their cavities, is that - 14 MR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice Sotomayor. No. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, there is some 16 privacy right? 17 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I can be clear about 18 this. It seems to me that Hudson v. Palmer and the - 19 and the history of the Fourth Amendment clearly suggest 20 that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy of 21 being viewed naked in a prison. And, therefore, the 22 ordinary Burlington approach of having somebody take a 23 shower and looking at him or her naked for tattoos and 24 health and incidental contraband, clearly 25 constitutional, clearly doesn't even raise a Fourth
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Amendment issue. 2 When you get beyond that point and start to 3 begin the -- what Essex does, which is not a true anal 4 cavity search but simply an anal-focused and 5 genital-focused search, I think that is subject to the 6 Turner v. Safley and/or the Bell v. Wolfish standard. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we go back to 8 Justice Alito's question? Isn't one of the factors that 9 we look at under the Fourth Amendment reasonableness? 10 And should we be thinking about the fact that many of 11 these people who are now being arrested are being put 12 into general populations or into jails, sometimes not 13 just overnight but for longer periods of time, like this 14 gentleman, for 6 days before he sees a magistrate? 15 Should we be considering a rule that basically says your 16 right to search someone depends on whether that 17 individual has in fact been arrested for a crime that's 18 going to lead to jail time or not, whether that person's 19 been presented to a magistrate to see whether there is 20 in fact probable cause for the arrest and detention of 21 this individual? I mean, there is something unsettling 22 about permitting the police to arrest people for things, 23 like kids who are staying out after curfew with no 24 other -- based on probably nothing else. 25 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Sotomayor, I think
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 what is disturbing about -- about this case is, in fact, 2 the -- that he was arrested under circumstances in which 3 he candidly shouldn't have been arrested as a matter of 4 State law. I understand that. But I think to change 5 the constitutional rule and to change the 6 Turner v. Safley and Bell v. Wolfish standards and 7 ignore what the underlying inquiry should be here, which 8 is these policies which apply across the board impinge 9 constitutional protections, but nevertheless 10 represent - 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what - 12 MR. PHILLIPS: -- the good-faith judgment of 13 our jailers. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what are we doing 15 with the presumption of innocence? That's also a 16 constitutional right. And so, shouldn't the degree to 17 which a search is permitted be conditioned in some way 18 on whether or not this person has been presented to a 19 magistrate? 20 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- if you ask me the way I 21 would analyze it, I would -- if you want to adopt a 22 different set of standards about who ought to be 23 arrested and who ought to be taken to jail, that's fine. 24 I understand that. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I mean -

Either they - 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought -- I 12 thought your friend said that is exactly what you do 13 with respect to the visual body cavity search, 14 reasonable articulable suspicion, under the new policy. 15 MR.

1 individual reason, right? 2 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. And you don't 4 require that with respect to simple strip search? 5 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So, you agree 7 with your friend that the only thing at issue here is 8 how close the guard is going to be to the individual who 9 you have no reasonable suspicion to think is different 10 than anybody else during a simple strip search? 11 MR. PHILLIPS: Well -- no - 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want -- he says 13 2 feet is too close; 5 feet or whatever is okay. You 14 want to go to 2 feet. You don't want to have to stand 15 back to 6 feet. That's all the case comes down to? 16 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't -- well, I mean, you 17 can characterize it that way. I mean, I think the 18 better way to think about it is that what Essex wants, 19 what -- you know, what Essex policy permitted it to do 20 was to examine the - 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not interested 22 in what Essex policy permitted it to do in the past. 23 I'm looking at the new policy, all right?

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- for everything 2 except simple strip search and observation. 3 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, see, that's the 4 problem, is that the language there is different. 5 Because the -- the truth is that the line that the new 6 policy draws is between a true -- what I -- what I think 7 Bell v. Wolfish was describing, where you ask the inmate 8 to bend over and expose his or her anus for a cavity 9 search. On that score, that's what -- we don't do that. 10 But we do, in fact, ask - 11 JUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Phillips - 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Could I 13 finish and find out what you do? You said: We don't do 14 that. We do -- what? 15 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. What we do is ask the 16 individual to lift his genitals and to squat and cough. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So, you do 18 more than a simple strip search. 19 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, slightly more than a 20 simple strip search. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: But, Mr. Phillips, there - 22 there - 23 MR.

1 the case beyond the ordinary visual inspection, and that 2 is this: Even though you have changed your policy 3 now - 4 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, we're still liable. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the question remains 6 whether that change in policy was constitutionally 7 required, so that when -- when you treated the -- the 8 plaintiff in a different fashion under the old policy, 9 that was a violation of the Constitution. 10 Doesn't -- doesn't that question remain in 11 the case? 12 MR.

And all I'm -- all I 21 -- the only point I've been trying to make here is that 22 if you -- if you look at the way the district court 23 analyzed the case, the district court split it up, and 24 it's the basis of the class distinction versus the - 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the record or common

1 experience justify an argument that if you have the 2 person who's stopped just for a traffic ticket, but that 3 person is going to be in custody for 5 or 6 days, that 4 person might well prefer an institution where everyone 5 has been searched before he or she is put into the 6 population with - 7 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Kennedy, there 8 actually is testimony in the record from the warden 9 saying that in order to ensure everybody's safety, we 10 are better off with a blanket policy that says that 11 we're going to engage in -- in some form of the search. 12 Essex has a slightly more intrusive one. But it is all 13 designed to accomplish the same thing. It's not just 14 designed to ensure against contraband and -- and that. 15 It's designed to ensure that there isn't somebody like 16 Mr. Florence who's going to end up being poked or 17 otherwise - 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any evidence -- I 19 count seven or eight States anyway that have some 20 variation of the reasonable suspicion rule like what 21 they want, roughly. Is there any evidence at all that 22 in those seven or eight States, there is more contraband 23 being smuggled in? 24 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there is the testimony 25 in the record from their expert, who said that in
48

1 Kentucky, there is today -- the single biggest problem 2 in Kentucky prisons and the biggest cause of death is 3 drug overdose, which suggests that there's a serious 4 contraband issue in Kentucky. Kentucky is in one of 5 those -- is one of those -- is inside one of the 6 circuits that has had a reasonable suspicion requirement 7 as a constitutional matter forever. 8 So, I would say there -- yes, there is some 9 evidence from which you could infer that it's worse now 10 than it was. But I would also ask the Court to rely on 11 its common sense and its own -- and what it essentially 12 took judicial notice of in Bell v. Wolfish and 13 Rutherford v. Black, which is this is a serious problem, 14 and it is no less a serious problem today than it was 15 more than 30 years ago, when the Court addressed - 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there any limits - 17 are there any constitutional limits, in your view? You 18 say you didn't attempt the kind of search that was done 19 in Bell v. Wolfish. Is there any constitutional 20 impediment to your doing so? 21 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I don't believe that - 22 my position would be, no, there isn't a constitutional 23 impediment, but - 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, there's no - 25 MR. PHILLIPS: -- the balance would tip in

1 favor of the -- of the institution under those 2 circumstances. I do think -- obviously, there is a 3 limit between a manual physical body cavity search, and 4 that it seems to me, yes, I -- that would -- that would 5 be a very different balance of the equation, and I -- I 6 suspect I would be very hard pressed to just -- to 7 convince five members of this Court that that's the - 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you want us to write 9 an opinion that applies only to squatting and coughing. 10 Is that it? 11 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, you may want to write 12 it slightly differently - 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 14 (Laughter.) 15 MR. PHILLIPS: -- Justice Scalia. No, but 16 what -- but what I would really like is an opinion that 17 recognizes that deference to the prisons and to their 18 judgment is what's appropriate under these 19 circumstances, and that extends all the way to the 20 Bell v. Wolfish line. The only difference being that I 21 would like for the Court to analyze it under Turner 22 v. Safley, in which -- in which the analysis is -- is 23 this -- you know, is there a logical nexus between the 24 rule that the -- that the prisons have and preventing a 25 problem? And the answer is yes. And are there
50

1 reasonable alternatives? And there, the answer is no. 2 If the - 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You are saying that they 4 can do the full -- as far as the Constitution is 5 concerned, all of these searches are permissible. 6 MR. PHILLIPS: All -- clearly, all of our 7 searches are permissible, and I would go - 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In Bell v. Wolfish - 9 MR. PHILLIPS: In Bell v. Wolfish. Yes. I 10 think that's exactly the holding of Bell v. Wolfish. 11 Bell v. Wolfish was not tied in its opinion itself to 12 the fact that they - 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they did -- they did 14 stress that there was a visitor who could -- who could 15 give the inmate contraband. Bell v. Wolfish doesn't - 16 and I asked Mr. Goldstein whether we know whether the 17 pretrial detainees in New York were searched that way on 18 entry, and he said there's nothing that shows one way or 19 the other. 20 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I think that's -- I 21 think that's correct. We don't know. And, of course, 22 part of the -- and part of the empirical problem in - 23 in that is that that facility had only been open for 4 24 months anyway. So, it was really going to be difficult, 25 if you were going to adopt the policy they adopted in
51

Alderson Reporting Company

1 Bell, to insist on some sort of empirical proof. 2 JUSTICE KAGAN: The one significant 3 difference between Bell and this case is that in Bell, 4 there was a real opportunity for people to plan, to 5 conspire together to bring in contraband. Here, you're 6 talking about somebody who's arrested on the spot, 7 there's no opportunity for planning, for conspiracy with 8 respect to contraband, is there? 9 MR. PHILLIPS: No, but the policy itself - 10 may I answer the question? 11 The policy is aimed at all people, not just 12 at Mr. Florence, and if you aim it at all people, there 13 are people who self-report who've obviously got an 14 opportunity to bring in contraband, and there are a lot 15 of people who just get arrested and happen to have drugs 16 or something on them and, rather than show those when 17 they're being stopped for a speeding ticket, will likely 18 stick it in their pocket or put it somewhere else. 19 Thank you, Your Honor. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 21 Ms. Saharsky. 22 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY 23 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE 24 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 25 MS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 please the Court: 2 The searches at issue in Bell are very 3 similar to the searches at issue in this case, and they 4 should be upheld. I want to start with Justice Kagan's 5 question. It is true that contact visits in Bell are 6 different from a person coming into the -- to the jail 7 for the first time in that there might be a greater 8 opportunity for planning, but as one of the Justices 9 pointed out, there was less of an opportunity to 10 actually get contraband, the person coming in was going 11 to be searched, the inmate, as Justice Marshall pointed 12 out, was wearing a one-piece zip-up jumper, and he's 13 being watched the entire time. 14 The visit -- the contraband situation in 15 this case at intake, the person does have an 16 opportunity, even if they are not self-reporting, 17 knowing that they're going to be arrested. Protesters, 18 for example, who decide deliberately to get arrested. 19 They might be stopped by the police, they see the squad 20 car behind them. They might have a gun or contraband in 21 their car and think, hey, I'm going to put that on my 22 person; I just need to get it somewhere that's not going 23 to be found during a pat-down search. And then 24 potentially they have the contraband with them. 25 Also, the process of going from the
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 arrest -- point of arrest to the general jail population 2 is not a quick one. The person typically goes, for 3 example, to a metropolitan police department -- that's 4 what happens here -- and the person would mix 5 potentially there in a holding cell with other 6 offenders. 7 If this Court, for example, adopted a rule 8 saying that minor offenders would not be searched in a 9 way that other offenders would, I have no doubt that 10 there are some offenders in those circumstances, all on 11 the bus together to go to the general jail population, 12 who would give the stuff to the minor offenders - 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how does that - 14 MS. SAHARSKY: -- to try to get them to 15 bring it in. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not the Federal 17 rule. And, by the way, the brief was really confusing. 18 When what -- when I read page 1, page 1 tells me that 19 the BOP policy requires all incoming pretrial detainees 20 to be subject to visual body cavity inspections. And 21 then it isn't until page 30 that I learn there is an 22 exception for the very category of arrestee that we're 23 talking about here, that they are not subject to body 24 cavity inspections unless there's reasonable suspicion 25 that they're concealing contraband. That the
54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 misdemeanor or civil contempt offender is not subject. 2 MS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry if that was 3 confusing. The Bureau of Prisons' policy is that a 4 person will not be put in the general population, being 5 allowed to mix with other offenders, unless he or she 6 has undergone the strip search. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I want to know 8 how people in this category are treated in the Federal 9 system. And you -- you - 10 MS. SAHARSKY: The people - 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You reversed it. They - 12 those people are not subject to this visual body cavity 13 search. 14 MS. SAHARSKY: Those people, when they go 15 into the jail, would be asked whether they're willing to 16 consent to this type of search. In most cases, they do 17 consent. If they don't consent and there is not 18 reasonable suspicion, then they are not placed in the 19 general jail population; they are kept separate from the 20 other offenders. So, it is the case, the rule that the 21 Third Circuit identified, which is a blanket policy that 22 anyone that's going to go into the general jail 23 population and mix with everyone else has to be strip 24 searched. That is the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 25 policy. I should note that -
55

Alderson Reporting Company

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I'm sure 2 I missed something. You say when they go in they're 3 asked: Will you consent to a more intrusive body cavity 4 search and be put into the general population; or if you 5 don't, you don't have to be searched and we put you in 6 some place else. Who consents to that? 7 (Laughter.) 8 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, the general jail 9 population has certain facilities, you know, computer 10 facilities and others that you don't get when you're in 11 a cell by yourselves. As a practical matter, this 12 arises very, very infrequently in the Federal system. 13 We're talking about fewer than 1 percent of offenders. 14 And the question before the Court at this 15 point really is you have before you a blanket policy 16 saying we need to strip search everyone, and is that 17 something that's unreasonable or irrational in the way 18 that the Court has considered its normal deference to 19 prison officials? And I just -- I would like to - 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand most of the 21 general propositions that your side is advancing, but I 22 have to say I was somewhat surprised at the evidence of 23 the amount of contraband that was discovered, the amount 24 of weapons that was discovered that's in the literature 25 and that's in the citations, of course, was somewhat
56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 skimpy. I thought there would be a stronger showing 2 than I -- than I found in the briefs. 3 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, there -- there are not 4 empirical studies of this type of information. 5 Typically it arises when there are incidents at a 6 facility, and incident reports are written up. They're 7 not published regularly. There's not some kind of 8 laboratory study that you can do. The facilities have 9 an incident that they try to deal with. Sometimes it 10 makes the news. Those are some of the things that we 11 reported. And I would hate for the Court to think that 12 there is not evidence of people who've committed - 13 minor offenders in the record bringing in very serious 14 things into prisons and jails. 15 I'd point you to footnote 15 in the 16 Government's brief, which talks about people being 17 arrested for traffic offenses and smuggling crack pipes 18 in body cavities. I'd point the Court to both experts 19 in this case cited by Mr. Phillips. I'd point the Court 20 to the record in Bull, the San Francisco case. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The issue has to be 22 certainly some misdemeanor. Some people charged with 23 misdemeanor crimes will try to smuggle things in. The 24 issue is how many of them would not have been found on a 25 reasonable suspicion standard? I think Justice Breyer
57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 said, in the San Francisco study, it appears only one. 2 MS. SAHARSKY: I think that that's a very 3 hazardous thing for courts to do with 20/20 hindsight. 4 You know, the Court could look back at individual 5 offenders and might have information - 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But we don't have 20/20. 7 We have how many years? Fifteen years since Bell - 8 MS. SAHARSKY: What I - 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- where prisons have 10 been applying the reasonable suspicion standard. And 11 the most you can muster under that standard is one 12 example of a case where someone has entered? At some 13 point, empirical evidence has to mean something in terms 14 of us judging the question of reasonableness. 15 MS. SAHARSKY: I agree with you, but what 16 I'm saying is that the individuals who are doing the 17 searches at issue have very limited information about 18 people. This is when you have people who are coming 19 into the first -- the system for the first time. They 20 have had the most contact with the outside world. You 21 have the least amount of information about them. In the 22 Federal system, you don't know - 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I -- I do have a 24 question about that today. I know that when -- it's bad 25 to base your judgments on your own personal experiences.

1 When I was a prosecutor, it took sometimes days to get a 2 rap sheet. I understand that that's no longer the case 3 today, that they're virtually almost always accessible 4 by computers today. 5 MS. SAHARSKY: That may be true, but it's 6 not the information that the people who do intake and 7 are doing the searches have. They do not have that 8 information at their fingertips in the Federal system. 9 They have name, date of birth, and they have the offense 10 that the person was charged with. They don't know 11 anything else. 12 And the question before the Court, if I may, 13 is whether there are reasons for a blanket rule that 14 this Court should defer to. And I would say there are 15 several. 16 First of all you cannot say that there are 17 some minor offenders that don't pose a contraband risk. 18 They are documented in the record. Second, you have 19 individuals who are making very quick determinations. 20 They're -- they have large numbers of people to -- to 21 get through -- into the general prison population. They 22 have very little time, and if they guess wrong, those 23 mistakes can be deadly. Third, the rule needs to be - 24 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose we accept the 25 Petitioner's concession that it is permissible to
59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 require everybody who is arrested to disrobe and shower 2 under the observation of the corrections officer from a 3 certain distance. Now the question would become: How 4 many people who do that will still be able to smuggle in 5 contraband? 6 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, there would be 7 contraband found in -- that would be in body cavities. 8 And we have documented in this record and other records 9 in our brief that there are folks who do that, and that 10 contraband is not found until they do these squat and 11 cough procedures. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: That's my -- that's my 13 problem. I don't -- I overstated the -- the strength of 14 your evidence. I was just trying to throw it out -- or 15 I understated it. San Francisco's point is really that 16 30 to 60 percent or some very high percentage of people 17 who come in for minor crimes are high on drugs or have 18 been -- and there is just that footnote really which has 19 a few examples. Definitely, they're there in this 20 category. So, would it be helpful if you included in 21 the excluded part people who are high on drugs? You 22 see? So, we give you the high on drugs people. It's 23 the drug offense, and those who are high on drugs and 24 those -- I mean, is there a way of drawing this rule 25 that we can even catch most of the people in footnote
60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 50 - 2 MS. SAHARSKY: I think the fundamental 3 question for the Court is who is supposed to be doing 4 this line drawing. And you've said case after case 5 after case that you're going to defer to the prison and 6 jail officials who are seeing this stuff on the ground 7 day to day. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: But it's obvious that the 9 simplest thing for any prison official is say do it for 10 everybody. 11 MS. SAHARSKY: That's - 12 JUSTICE BREYER: And so, the fact they do it 13 for everybody and don't try to make some exclusion for 14 traffic violators or something might be consistent with 15 little or no evidence; it might be consistent with some. 16 That's why I keep looking for it. 17 MS. SAHARSKY: There are many good reasons, 18 though, to have a policy to do it for everyone. It is 19 easily -- easy to administer when you have lots of 20 people. It is done for the protection of people like 21 Petitioner who don't want to be knifed in the shower - 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the reason? If 23 there's so much sense to that policy, why isn't it the 24 Federal policy? Before you said because there aren't 25 that many offenders. If there were more, then would
61

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 there be -- would the Federal policy change so that even 2 people who are in on a contempt charge or a minor 3 crime - 4 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. The Federal Government 5 thinks that that blanket policy is a good one. It made 6 one modification to its policy in 2003 when the weight 7 of the circuits was against it. But, again, this is a 8 policy that is done for everyone's protection. A point 9 that Justice Kennedy made earlier is that there - 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm sorry, I didn't 11 understand. You think the Feds think it's a good policy 12 to inspect everyone? 13 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes, to inspect everyone who 14 would be put in the general jail population. That is 15 the Third Circuit's holding, and that's what we're 16 defending in this case. That's -- because when you have 17 a rule that treats everyone the same, you don't have 18 folks that are singled out. You don't have any security 19 gaps. We urge you to affirm the judgment of the court 20 below. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 22 Mr. Goldstein, take 4 minutes. 23 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 24 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, sir.

1 I have three points to make: The first is 2 that my friend from the United States says defer to the 3 experts. But the point that the United States 4 consistently omits is that there are 600,000 offenders 5 that go into the Federal system every year. I don't 6 understand the claim that -- this only involves 1 7 percent of Federal offenders. 8 The Marshals Service and ICE admit 600,000 9 offenders every year under our standard. They are not 10 kept in separate housing. These are cited in our brief. 11 Six hundred thousand people, is their expert judgment, 12 are subject to a reasonable suspicion standard when 13 they're admitted to jail. 14 The second point, about numbers, 15 Justice Breyer, there is a significant empirical study, 16 and that is the County of Orange case. The district 17 judge there did an unbelievably detailed job going 18 through the record of 26,000 admissions into the system 19 and was able to identify only a single instance where 20 contraband would have gotten in under a reasonable 21 suspicion standard. 22 There is also evidence in this case, and it 23 is the evidence, to my surprise, that my friends keep 24 pointing to. There's a memorandum from the Essex jail 25 system. It's at page 70a to 71a of the joint appendix.
63

1 And it tells you two really relevant things. It says 2 every year they admit 25,175 people into this jail, and 3 that they only found 14 instances of contraband. And 4 they don't even make the claim that those 14 instances 5 out of 25,000 would not have been found under a 6 reasonable suspicion standard. So, you have evidence in 7 this record about this particular case. 8 Third, a couple of points have been made 9 about whether -- Justice Breyer, you asked whether 10 someone who's high on drugs. The uniform rule -- and 11 this is not just the ABA but the expert standard of the 12 American Correctional Association. What they say is 13 that essentially almost anything will do. What will not 14 amount to reasonable suspicion is when you have a minor 15 offender -- and we do have -- there are 700,000 people 16 in jail in the United States every year for misdemeanor 17 offenses. This is -- this is a lot of people who are 18 having a very significant intrusion on privacy. 19 And the expert standard, the rule that was 20 applied under Bell v. Wolfish, is that when you have 21 people who come in on a minor offense -- they don't have 22 any drug history. They are not high on drugs. There 23 was no opportunity to hide a weapon. I'm not sure where 24 they think the gun is going to be hidden that's not 25 going to show up in the very close manual pat down that
64

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 they do of every one of these people that isn't going to 2 show up in - 3 JUSTICE ALITO: I don't think you're really 4 arguing for a -- an individualized reasonable suspicion 5 standard. I think you're arguing for a rule that draws 6 distinctions based on categories that correspond only 7 perhaps very roughly to reasonable suspicion. 8 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, first, there are real 9 categories that are overinclusive in favor of the jails, 10 like if it's a serious offense or if they have any drug 11 history. And then on top of that, if there's any 12 individualized basis that the jails can articulate, that 13 will do as well. 14 We are not saying that categorically people 15 will be excluded from being searched. We're saying that 16 there are entire categories that will automatically be 17 searchable. We're just saying don't throw the baby out 18 with the bath water. 19 When somebody is pulled over like Mr. 20 Florence, and there's just -- it's laugh-out-loud funny 21 to think he's smuggling in -- something into this jail; 22 that it's too much of an intrusion to put him under the 23 direct, you know, 2 feet away, I'm going to look at your 24 genitals, as opposed to the ordinary intrusion of saying 25 we're going to oversee the showers.
