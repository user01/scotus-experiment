2 (11:12 a.m.)

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument in number

4 04-607, Laboratory Corporation of America against Metabolite

5 Laboratories.

6 Mr. Franklin, whenever you're ready, you may

7 proceed.

8 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN

9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10 MR. FRANKLIN: Justice Stevens, and may it

11 please the Court:

12 The patent claim at issue in this case was

13 held to be infringed whenever any doctor looks at a

14 homocysteine test result and reflexively thinks about a

15 basic natural correlation. The result has been multimillion

16 dollar damages and an injunction prohibiting a testing

17 company from conducting important homocysteine tests by any

18 method and for any reason whatsoever.

19 As broadly construed by the Federal Circuit,

20 this claim is invalid as a matter of law for two closely

21 related reasons. It contravenes both of this Court's

22 settled proscription against effectively patenting laws of

23 nature or natural phenomena as well as the requirement that

24 a patent must fully and clearly describe, disclose and

25 enable an actual invention and must not sweep so far as to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 encompass more than what was actually invented.

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that second point -- is

3 that second point definiteness?

4 MR. FRANKLIN: The second point is

5 definiteness, it's enablement.

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does definiteness describe

7 this second aspect that you've just --

8 MR. FRANKLIN: It describes part of it, Your

9 Honor.

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just part of it.

11 MR. FRANKLIN: There is definiteness, there is

12 enablement, there is written description. We think all of

13 those are contravened here.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's examine them. What if

15 it definitely goes so far as to allow no other use of this

16 natural law that it's discovered? It definitely goes that

17 far, isn't definiteness fully satisfied?

18 MR. FRANKLIN: I think not, Your Honor,

19 because --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: No?

21 MR. FRANKLIN: -- definiteness would still

22 require that you distinctly claim an invention here and

23 that's one of the things that's absent in this case. But

24 even moving beyond that, Your Honor --

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's indefinite because we

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 don't know where our thoughts will take us? Suppose there a

2 patent which requires looking at the clouds in the sky for

3 10 minutes. I mean, that's maybe absurd, but it's certainly

4 definite.

5 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, Your Honor, if it is

6 definite, then it is certainly not enabling of an actual

7 invention. And here the Morse case, which we have cited in

8 our briefs, comes into play. In that case, the court held

9 that Samuel Morse was entitled to patent his innovative

10 telegraph but he couldn't go further to effectively patent

11 the law of nature or natural phenomenon associated with it

12 and thereby monopolize all manner of devices and processes

13 that he did not invent and did not enable or describe.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wasn't the issue there

15 what is patentable? I mean this case in the district court

16 was under this definiteness idea, 112. 101 deals with

17 what's patentable. And it seems to me that you -- this case

18 was presented as a definiteness case.

19 MR. FRANKLIN: But it was not just

20 definiteness, Your Honor. It was section 112. But let me

21 get to the Morse case because as we have explained in our

22 reply brief and, in fact, in our opening brief, the Morse

23 case was in fact decided under what is now section 112. The

24 Court cited and quoted the relevant statute which has not

25 changed in any material respect today. The Court made clear

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that the problem in that case, at page 120 of the opinion,

2 was that Morse claims what he has not described in the

3 manner required by law.

4 And what we have here is the same situation.

5 We have these patentees who are indisputably entitled to

6 patent their innovative method for measuring homocysteine.

7 And LabCorp continues to use that method sometimes and we

8 pay royalties whenever we use that method. But what they

9 couldn't do is what Samuel Morse tried to do and push the

10 envelope, and try to effectively patent the natural

11 phenomenon associated with all homocysteine tests and

12 thereby gain a monopoly over just not the one that they

13 invented, not just those that are in the prior art, which

14 itself would be impermissible, but even yet to be invented

15 assays.

16 And here is the nub of this case. LabCorp has

17 sought to use but has been penalized for using and is

18 prevented from using a more efficient and cost-effective

19 method for assaying homocysteine than the one that these

20 patentees invented. The method that LabCorp seeks to use,

21 which is the Abbott method, reduces the processing time for

22 homocysteine tests down from what was up to 18 hours under

23 the patentee's method down to a manner of minutes.

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the Abbott test -- that's

25 patented and you're paying royalties for that?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FRANKLIN: Actually, I don't know, Your

2 Honor. And, I just don't know whether it's patented but it

3 is certainly not covered by their claims 1 through 12, which

4 have never been -- well, the district court found that those

5 claims didn't apply here, and that's not an issue.

6 The Abbott method is different. It's an

7 immunoassay. It is not the same kind of mass spectometry

8 gas chromatograph method that they have described. It's

9 much more efficient, it's much more cost-effective and the

10 reason obviously that LabCorp wants to use that method is to

11 more effectively serve patients and their doctors and to

12 meet the burgeoning demand for homocysteine tests. But

13 because these patentees have effectively claimed the patent

14 on the natural correlation that's associated with all

15 homocysteine tests, they have prevented LabCorp from using

16 what the patent laws would seek to encourage, that is, a

17 more cost-effective, innovative, different method, the kind

18 of thing -- exactly the kind of thing that the Court was

19 concerned about in Morse.

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The opinion of the Court of

21 Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the appendix begins

22 discussion of claim 13 about page 16a. Are there some, one

23 or two sentences there or a paragraph that you can tell me

24 is completely wrong?

25 MR. FRANKLIN: In the Federal Circuit's --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. You're asking us to

2 reverse this court of appeals decision and I'm looking, and

3 particularly with reference to claim 13, the one we're

4 talking about, I assume, and I'm looking through pages, say,

5 16 and 21 to find something that's absolutely wrong.

6 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, I think what --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want me to tell the court

8 of appeals, well, you can't do this. But where is it wrong?

9 MR. FRANKLIN: I think where it's wrong, Your

10 Honor, is that it proceeds from an assumption that is wrong

11 in itself and that is --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you can't point me to any

13 particular sentence that -- that's absolutely wrong?

14 MR. FRANKLIN: I think that the argument in --

15 the Federal Circuit's decision is wrong in its enablement

16 discussion, it's wrong in its written description

17 discussion. I mean, just to take one, the written

18 description posits that this is a valid written description

19 because the inventors, as the Federal Circuit says in its

20 opinion, possessed the correlating step. And I think what's

21 wrong about that, Your Honor, is that nobody can possess the

22 correlation. And that's the nub of this case.

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And where does it say this?

24 MR. FRANKLIN: I'm sorry, that is at page -- I

25 believe it's at 17 of the appendix. Let me just make sure

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 I've got the right -- and that was when it talks

2 about --

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You see my point? I'm not

4 sure what it is you want me to say went wrong, other than

5 the fact that this patent is, should never have been granted

6 to begin with but that wasn't raised.

7 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, I think it was raised,

8 Your Honor. The validity issue was raised in the district

9 court, it was raised on appeal. The district court had

10 construed the patent as requiring -- and part of the

11 district court's claim construction addressed the issue as

12 to whether or not one could patent a law of nature or

13 effectively patent a scientific idea. The district court

14 said this patent must require something more, and that is at

15 joint appendix page 60. It must require something more than

16 simple existence of the relationship between homocysteine

17 and vitamin deficiencies. And one of the places that the

18 Federal Circuit did get it wrong, Your Honor, was in

19 abandoning that limitation that the district court had

20 imposed on the patent.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: I guess that --

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you're arguing now, as I

23 understand it, that the reason you win on definiteness is

24 that it sweeps in even as yet uninvented processes.

25 MR. FRANKLIN: Yes.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: And it does so by means, in

2 effect, of erecting this umbrella of a natural fact which is

3 intended to cover every process that might be relevant to

4 establishing that natural fact.

5 MR. FRANKLIN: Yes.

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: So that you're saying we

7 cannot -- no court can decide definiteness in this situation

8 without hitting the patentable issue.

9 MR. FRANKLIN: Absolutely, Your Honor. That's

10 exactly what we're arguing. And that's where the Federal

11 Circuit got it wrong. And we did in fact urge the Court --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: But you told the -- you said,

13 judge, if you in fact hold that this claim 13 satisfies

14 section 112 and is sufficiently precise and specific and

15 concise, if you hold that, then the claim would violate

16 Morse?

17 MR. FRANKLIN: Yes, it would violate --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: And you argued that

19 specifically? And so your problem -- I guess that you said

20 that. I mean, you quote it in your supplementary brief on

21 page 6.

22 MR. FRANKLIN: We did say that. Yes.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: And it's the language.

24 MR. FRANKLIN: Yes.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what it said. It

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 didn't say Morse. It said Diehr.

2 MR. FRANKLIN: Diehr, which --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: Dier incorporates Morse.

4 MR. FRANKLIN: Yes.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: As was my understanding.

6 MR. FRANKLIN: Yes.

7 JUSTICE BREYER: So your complaint about the

8 paragraph on 17a is that it did not deal with that

9 argument.

10 MR. FRANKLIN: Yes.

11 JUSTICE BREYER: But I imagine they'll say that

12 simply mentioning it in an oral argument is not enough to

13 get us to think seriously about it.

14 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, it was in the brief, Your

15 Honor, and I think that it was also in, with the premise of

16 everything that we argued, because the district court had

17 already -- and again, I point the Court to joint appendix

18 page 60. The district court had already held that it had to

19 mean -- the patent had to mean something more than the

20 simple relationship, the simple existence of the

21 relationship between elevated homocysteine and vitamin

22 deficiencies. And the premise of the entire Federal Circuit

23 argument and, in fact, to the arguments below was that we

24 don't know what that anything is, because the patent doesn't

25 tell you.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 The Federal Circuit blew past that, Your Honor,

2 and what the Federal Circuit said, which makes the issue

3 front and center now, is the Federal Circuit said, and this

4 is at 18a. "The correlating step is a simple conclusion

5 that a cobalamin/folate deficiency exists vel non based on

6 the assaying step."

7 And what that means is now, as a result of the

8 Federal Circuit's decision, unlike the district court's

9 decision, we now know that every homocysteine test

10 automatically infringes because every doctor will

11 reflexively look at it and think about the phenomenon

12 associated with it.

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You set off the district

14 court and the court of appeals but you don't think the

15 district court got it right, either. You said the district

16 court required something more.

17 MR. FRANKLIN: Yes.

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the something more

19 and why wasn't that adequate?

20 MR. FRANKLIN: We don't know and that's why it

21 wasn't adequate. That's why we had always argued under

22 indefiniteness and under enablement, under written

23 description. We had no idea. The patent doesn't tell you.

24 We suggested one way. That wasn't -- the Federal Circuit

25 didn't agree with us. The problem with the district

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 court's -- we agreed with the district court's claim

2 construction. That far, we did. But then there was nothing

3 more even adduced at trial, and this was the argument we

4 consistently made. The Federal Circuit then abandoned what

5 the district court did and then we here have it front and

6 center with the patent --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What the district court did

8 is it got, it tried this case and it got a rather large jury

9 verdict.

10 MR. FRANKLIN: Yes.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I don't understand how

12 you're setting off the district court from the court of

13 appeals when the court of appeals, whatever it said, it

14 affirmed the judgment of the district court.

15 MR. FRANKLIN: It did, but the claim

16 construction is the part of what I'm talking about. At page

17 60, I'll just read what the district court said.

18 "Correlating is a verb and must mean more than the simple

19 existence of a relationship between a high level

20 homocysteine and deficiency in cobalamin or folate."

21 The Federal Circuit's opinion is contrary to

22 that, Your Honor, and that's where this whole issue gets put

23 front and center now. And what we have here under the

24 Federal Circuit's extraordinarily broad construction is we

25 have nothing more than the reflexive mental recognition of a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 natural correlation preceded by the inherent and generic

2 step of somehow ascertaining the input for that correlation.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I could see how that broad

4 interpretation would raise perhaps for the -- clearly raise

5 for the first time the section 101 issue. But, so that

6 should have been clear to you by the time the court of

7 appeals decision came out, right? But did you, in your

8 petition here, rely on 101?

9 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, we relied, Your Honor, on

10 all of -- many, many cases in court interpreting that

11 provision and others under the law of nature doctrine --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: You never mentioned 101,

13 though, did you?

14 MR. FRANKLIN: We didn't but just as an

15 example, Your Honor. The court's invitation or, to the

16 solicitor general didn't mention 101, but everybody knew

17 what the court was talking about. And let me just -- the

18 petition couldn't have raised -- the petition squarely

19 raised the issue. On page 18, we cited Diamond versus

20 Diehr, Benson, Funk Brothers, Mackay Radio and the Le Roy

21 case from 1852. On page 26, we cited, quoted, relied on

22 Funk Brothers and Mackay Radio again. Page 27 refers back

23 to the authorities at page 18 of the petition. Page 28

24 states that under the Federal Circuit's holding, anyone who

25 claims to be the first to discover scientific correlation

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 could patent it simply by drafting the vague test plus

2 correlate claim.

3 This issue was presented in the petition. It

4 is within the question presented. And, Your Honor, I think

5 that the issue is easy to resolve given the Federal

6 Circuit's broad construction. Under that construction,

7 again, there is nothing more than the recognition of the

8 natural phenomenon preceded by what is the inherent step in

9 any natural correlation of ascertaining the input. And as

10 we have said without contradiction in the opening brief, if

11 this patent is valid, then anyone can gain a patent over a

12 scientific correlation by doing this kind of artful

13 drafting. Einstein could have patented E=MC2 which this

14 Court has stated on more than one occasion could not be

15 patented simply by doing a test plus correlate.

16 To take another hypothetical that was stated in

17 the opening brief without contradiction, if I discover

18 tomorrow a new correlation between having a certain kind of

19 blood type and a medical condition that heretofore people do

20 not know about, I could run down to the Patent Office,

21 patent that correlation and the effect of that would be to

22 monopolize all blood typing, no matter whether it's done

23 through methods in the prior art or methods yet to be

24 developed.

25 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it true as the Respondents

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 argue that a holding in your favor would call into question

2 thousands of patents?

3 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, they don't mention all --

4 the number but I don't think it would call into question a

5 huge swath of patents. It would call into question patents

6 that are like this one, obviously, things that are simply

7 test plus correlate.

8 JUSTICE ALITO: And do you have any idea how

9 many there are of those?

10 MR. FRANKLIN: No. You would have to do an

11 exhaustive search. There are some and I believe that some

12 of the ones that the Respondents cite, some of the claims --

13 and let's distinguish between patents and claims here,

14 because it might invalidate some claims in some patents,

15 which is not unusual because patent drafters often push the

16 envelope. They patent this -- in this case, they have

17 indisputably unchallenged and valid patent claims for a

18 method of measuring homocysteine, but they went further in

19 claim 13. And to the extent there are other patents that

20 might have those kind of claims, yes. But to the extent

21 we're talking about the broader swath of patents dealing

22 with things like genes, no.

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if that's -- if there is

24 some likelihood or possibility of this that we should assess,

25 it seems to me that it's imprudent for us to discuss it here

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 when it hasn't been discussed in the court of appeals.

2 MR. FRANKLIN: I think, well, it was, again, it

3 was pressed in the court of appeals. But again, what we're

4 talking about is deciding this case on its facts and

5 obviously to the extent there are other patents that are

6 just like this one, and the court has addressed this in the

7 context of Flook and Diehr and has distinguished between

8 those patents which facially looked rather similar but the

9 court was able to draw the distinctions. The Federal

10 Circuit can draw the distinctions.

11 But if it is a patent that is simply like this

12 one, which claims nothing more than a natural correlation

13 preceded by the inherent step of ascertaining the input, no

14 court, to my knowledge, has ever upheld such a patent before

15 this case.

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're urging on us something

17 like plain error, is about what you're telling us.

18 MR. FRANKLIN: No, I think that we're urging

19 the Court to examine the case that it has before it, look at

20 the patent and we're not asking the Court to go further than

21 this patent. Look at this patent, look at the Federal

22 Circuit's construction and that's something that we will

23 take as a given for purposes of today's proceeding.

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: You're saying this patent, you

25 really mean just claim 13, don't you?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FRANKLIN: I'm -- excuse me, Justice. And

2 again, I wanted, as I was saying to Justice Alito, you do

3 need to distinguish between patents and claims. And claim

4 13 is the only claim that's been asserted here. It's the

5 only claim that's being challenged. And let me just --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why shouldn't we do what the

7 Solicitor General proposed, that is, since we don't know for

8 sure, at least I don't know for sure, I'm not enough of a

9 scientist --

10 MR. FRANKLIN: Right.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- whether in fact the section

12 112 determination, as made by the Federal court, excludes all

13 other possible use of this natural phenomenon.

14 Since I don't know that for sure, why shouldn't

15 I tell the Federal Circuit, you know, your definition of

16 correlate raises this issue and you should resolve whether

17 it is true that there is no other possible usefulness for

18 this, no substantial usefulness?

19 MR. FRANKLIN: Quite simply, Your Honor, it's

20 because the Court doesn't need to reach that issue and

21 didn't need to reach it in any of its prior cases save one

22 and that's the Benson case where that issue came up really

23 in one sentence of the opinion. In the Morse case, in the

24 Funk Brothers case, in the Flook case, all of those patents

25 had -- were limited to a particular use.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Just take Morse's patent which was limited to

2 just conveying information at a distance through

3 electromagnetism. That was actually one very small sliver

4 of what you can do with electromagnetism. In fact, very,

5 very small. And the Court said, no, it doesn't matter.

6 Where what you have is effectively the patent on the

7 correlation, it doesn't matter whether you've limited it to

8 one use or many uses. So if the Court --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

10 MR. FRANKLIN: -- so I don't think the Court

11 needs to get into that. In Diehr, the Court made that

12 explicit that a field of use -- limiting a patent to a

13 field of use is not going to save that patent from

14 invalidity.

15 Now, if the Court does examine the issue, it

16 ought to do it the way it did it in Benson just by looking

17 at the broad sweep here. And how I would use it, Your

18 Honor, would be to say that in addition to all of the other

19 problems that this patent, as construed by the Federal

20 Circuit, has, it also has an extraordinarily broad

21 pre-emptive sweep. It applies to any homocysteine test, no

22 matter how it's done, no matter what reason it's done, no

23 matter if it's in the prior art, no matter if I invent it

24 tomorrow.

25 It applies to any act of even looking at the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 test. And here it's not just doctors. If anyone in the

2 audience today learns about this correlation because of this

3 argument, if they're listening carefully, and then they go

4 to their doctor and ask for a test, they will, number one,

5 be inducing infringement; number two, if they look at the

6 test result, now being armed with what we have given them,

7 which is the scientific knowledge that the correlation

8 exists, they will infringe. And there was testimony in

9 trial to that effect.

10 So I don't think the Court needs to get into

11 the inquiry, and I don't think the Patent Office really

12 wants to get into that inquiry either. To have to look at

13 each patent application to determine not just based on

14 what's in it whether it's valid but whether there are other

15 uses not even invented yet that might not be covered.

16 That's not, I submit, what the Patent Office would like to

17 do.

18 If I might reserve the remainder of my time.

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: You may, Mr. Franklin.

20 I think Mr. Hungar is next, Mr. Estrada.

21 MR. ESTRADA: Oh, sorry, Justice Stevens.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're too hungry,

23 Mr. Estrada.

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hungar.

25 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

2 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS AMICUS CURIAE

3 MR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

4 may it please the Court:

5 Claim 13 satisfies the written description,

6 enablement and definiteness requirements of section 112 of

7 the patent act. The patent specification sets forth the

8 scope and nature of the claimed invention in terms readily

9 understandable by a person of ordinary skill in the art and

10 it enables such persons to practice the claimed invention.

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you agree or you submit

12 that you can have a definite description of something that's

13 unpatentable because it's too broad?

14 MR. HUNGAR: Well, that obviously assumes the

15 conclusion, Your Honor. But with respect to the

16 definiteness requirement, the challenge seems to be that

17 because the first step of claim 13 is not limited to a

18 particular type of assay but instead claims all assays, that

19 that somehow renders it indefinite, and that argument is

20 simply incorrect as this Court has recognized for over a

21 hundred years.

22 In the Cochrane against Deener case, for

23 example, the Court addressed that question where a process

24 claim was not limited to a particular method of performing a

25 particular step of the process, and the Court said quote, "A

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 process may be patentable irrespective of the particular

2 form of the instrumentalities used", closed quote. And the

3 Court reiterated that principle in the Diehr case.

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, but, but -- well, let's

5 assume that there is a claim that includes something that

6 should not be patentable, because it's too broad or it

7 involves the scientific phenomena, the mechanics of the

8 universe. Can a patent still be definite if it includes

9 that sort of unpatentable claim?

10 MR. HUNGAR: It can be. It might or might not

11 be depending on the circumstances. The Morse case is an

12 example where it was both indefinite and invalid because

13 trying to claim a principle of nature, in effect. But by

14 the same token you can easily have, and in fact you have

15 here, a claim where it's definite in that persons of

16 ordinary skill in the art understand the scope of the

17 claims. They know what is and is not within the scope of

18 the patent, which is, in this case, a question entirely

19 separate from the question whether, as construed by the

20 Court and as understood by the person of ordinary skill in

21 the art, it's valid, under section 101, that is, under the

22 scope of patentable subject matter.

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: What do you think about its

24 validity under 101?

25 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, as we suggested in our

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 brief, we don't think that that question is properly before

2 the Court but that --

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand, but I didn't ask

4 you what you said in your brief.

5 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. But that if the

6 Court were to reach that question, we think that while it's

7 unclear because the issue wasn't litigated, there appears to

8 be prima facie evidence of invalidity under Benson, this

9 Court's decision in Benson, because, given what we currently

10 know, it appears that the claim as construed by the court of

11 appeals preempts all substantial practical applications of

12 the correlation. But because that issue wasn't litigated

13 below, if the Court were to reach it, it should remand --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: To you read the the patent as --

15 talking about step 1, you can use any assay method you want.

16 It doesn't have to be patented. But the correlation, step 2,

17 that any time you ask a doctor to tell us what you think the

18 results of the test mean, that that's an infringement?

19 MR. HUNGAR: That's how the court of appeals

20 construed it, yes, Your Honor. I'm sorry. Is that --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: And is it possible that that

22 can be patentable, in your view?

23 MR. HUNGAR: Well, again, Your Honor, we --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: If you just go to the doctor

25 and ask for advice and he says, yes, I've looked at the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 results; you've got a vitamin B deficiency or whatever it

2 is --

3 MR. HUNGAR: As we indicated --

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- he's committed

5 infringement under this patent as I understand it.

6 MR. HUNGAR: As we indicated in our brief, we

7 think that raises a potentially serious pre-emption problem

8 and it also raises the anticipation problem, that is, the

9 section 102 argument which is not before the Court but if it

10 were litigated --

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: It would raise the -- just

12 do you think that that patent is valid? That's what I'm

13 trying to ask you.

14 MR. HUNGAR: Well, we think it has validity

15 problems under section 102 and also under the pre-emption,

16 -- potentially under the pre-emption doctrine. We haven't

17 addressed the other issues that Petitioner seeks to put

18 before the Court involving Diehr and Flook, both because --

19 well, actually for four reasons.

20 First of all, it wasn't pressed or passed upon

21 below, it wasn't -- it's not fairly included within the

22 question presented, which construed at its most broad,

23 broadly, includes only the monopolization issue --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: I know all that. I'm just

25 really interested in your view of the patent. That's what

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 I'm trying to get to.

2 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. And as I've

3 said, we've identified two areas in which we think there are

4 potentially problems if they were in front of the Court.

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think there is a 101

6 problem too?

7 MR. HUNGAR: The preemption issue is a 101

8 problem, Your Honor. We haven't addressed -- as I said, we

9 have not taken a position on the broader section 101 issues

10 and we would urge the Court not to do so as well, in a case

11 in which it wasn't presented below, the Court doesn't have

12 the benefit of the lower court's assessment of that

13 question. And given that that question implicates

14 substantial reliance interests and --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: So we do have a fairly long

16 discussion by the lower court on the infringement issue. In

17 order to find infringement, they had to construe

18 correlation.

19 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor.

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

21 MR. HUNGAR: But the Court didn't grant

22 certiorari on that question. Yes.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't understand the

24 definiteness doctrine. I mean, all these things in 1854 I

25 guess weren't so clear. But I think the precise claim in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Samuel Morse's case was the use of the motive power of the

2 electric current for making or printing intelligible

3 characters. That sounds absolutely definite. Anyone can

4 understand it.

5 I thought the problem there was that although

6 anyone can understand it, you can't claim something as broad

7 as that. You must intend to claim something narrower. And

8 insofar as it's narrower, it isn't precise. So insofar as

9 it's broad, it's too broad, but definite. And insofar as

10 it's narrow, it's not there, but indefinite. Okay?

11 Precisely the claim that they raised before the

12 Federal Circuit and precisely the claim -- with appropriate

13 citations, and precisely the claim in respect to which the

14 Federal Circuit said nothing.

15 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I may have misspoken

16 before but I think it's probably most accurate to read the

17 Morse case as dealing with a written specification problem,

18 that is, the specification in claim 8, the one Your Honor is

19 referring to, didn't tell anything about the method by which

20 the principle of nature, electromagnetism, would be used.

21 All it did is describe a result, and it purported to claim

22 any, any method involving any number of steps that any

23 inventor might ever invent in the future, even if those

24 steps had nothing to do with -- if there was not a single

25 overlapping step between that new process and Morse's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 process.

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. And we here apply the

3 correlation to any homocysteine test, any one here, any one

4 in the future, any one that any mind might impend. What's the

5 difference?

6 MR. HUNGAR: Well, the difference is between

7 claiming a -- claiming all methods of achieving a particular

8 result and claiming one process for achieving that

9 particular result and then as one claiming any means of

10 doing one particular step of that process.

11 JUSTICE BREYER: I apply electricity to all

12 methods of putting down letters with electricity. I apply

13 the correlation to all methods of creating a homocysteine

14 test.

15 MR. HUNGAR: Well, again, Your Honor, if it is

16 true that all methods of employing the assay -- excuse me,

17 all methods of employing the correlation are preempted by

18 this patent claim, then it would be invalid under section

19 101. But to the extent the argument is an attempt to go

20 beyond that issue, we submit Morse doesn't support it and

21 indeed this Court's decision's in --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, I'm not talking about

23 going beyond it. I just thought that line between

24 definiteness and 101, 112, 101 is not quite so clear as I

25 would have thought, because it sounds to me relying on the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 1854 case of Samuel F. B. Morse, they're making the same

2 kind of argument and, indeed, you translated Morse as a

3 definiteness 112 argument, and yet it seemed to me that's

4 the kind of argument they're making.

5 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. And I think it

6 is more properly understood as a specification problem

7 because, as you say, anyone can understand the scope of that

8 claim. It's just that it was not sufficiently described

9 because he was purporting to claim any process even if it

10 had nothing to do with the process he had invented, and

11 that's not what's happening here. They claim a particular

12 step, that is, do an assay, as opposed to some other method,

13 and they claim any method of doing that assay within step 1

14 of the overall claim but they aren't saying -- for instance

15 the analogy would be if they had claimed we've just

16 devised one particular method of determining whether someone

17 has a vitamin deficiency and we therefore claim all other

18 methods of determining whether someone has a vitamin

19 deficiency.

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, I think you've hit what

21 is the problem for us. When you use the word assay, you

22 assume that that is excluding certain processes. And that's

23 not clear to me. Would you explain that in greater detail?

24 MR. HUNGAR: Well, again, we don't know --

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: I thought an assay was in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 effect synonymous with any process that gets the relevant

2 data and you're using it in a more -- I think, in answering

3 Justice Breyer's question, you were using it in a narrower

4 sense.

5 MR. HUNGAR: Well, I think that, as understood

6 by a person having ordinary skill in the art, we -- it may

7 be. We don't know because the issue wasn't litigated.

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I thought that was the

9 point of your argument, that there are assays and then there

10 are other methods. Did I misunderstand you?

11 MR. HUNGAR: Well, no. Certainly it's

12 conceivable that there are other methods and indeed the

13 patent claim -- the patent specification refers to -- or

14 suggests the possibility of assaying tissue as opposed to

15 fluid. The claim is limited to fluid.

16 I thank the Court.

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Hungar.

18 Mr. Estrada, it's your turn now.

19 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA

20 ON BEHALF OF THE ON RESPONDENTS

21 MR. ESTRADA: Thank you, Justice Stevens.

22 Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:

23 This was a hard fought jury trial in which the

24 jury rejected everything LabCorp had to sell. That judgment

25 should be affirmed for three reasons.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 The first is LabCorp never asked the trial

2 judge or the Federal Circuit to declare this patent invalid

3 under section 101, which is an affirmative defense they had

4 to plead in the answer and prove by clear and convincing

5 evidence.

6 Second, they're simply wrong on the merits of

7 the 101 case under this Court's cases.

8 And third, you can search their brief in vain

9 for a workable test for patentable subject matter that would

10 invalidate this patent and not bring complete havoc to the

11 patent world by calling into question numerous diagnostic

12 tests in medicine and otherwise, pharmaceuticals and other

13 inventions.

14 Let me deal briefly with the waiver question

15 because we don't get a sur-reply brief and there is a lot in

16 the reply brief that I wish I could deal with at length.

17 But I think I will say that it is a collection of cropped

18 quotes and very inventive characterizations of the record.

19 I will give you just two examples.

20 Bottom of page 9, they're trying to get out of

21 their Unitherm problem, never having this raised in the answer

22 or in the rule 50. And the footnote at the bottom of the page

23 discusses the rule 50 and states or at least suggests that this

24 argument in terms was raised before the trial court, concluding

25 with the sentence, "Respondents themselves understood LabCorp to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 have thereby presented subject matter patentability." They cite

2 to our brief on JMOL.

3 I have that here. This is what we said. "The

4 quick answer to LabCorp's mental steps theme is that LabCorp

5 never pled it in the defense. LabCorp pled invalidity on

6 the basis of 102, 103, 112 on the grounds that the patent

7 was anticipated, obvious, indefinite, non-enabled and

8 procured by inequitable conduct. But the so-called mental

9 steps doctrine goes instead to the question whether patent

10 covers statutory subject matter. That is governed

11 exclusively by section 1, 101. LabCorp has never mentioned

12 that section and has never pled the patent is invalid for

13 covering non-statutory subject matter even, in its present

14 JMOL motion.

15 Footnote: LabCorp failed to assert invalidity

16 on the basis of non-statutory subject matter in any of its

17 five answers or counterclaims or in any of its interrogatory

18 responses. None of its experts, including its patent law

19 expert, made any such assertion in any reports or testimony.

20 That gets translated in the reply brief as we understood

21 this issue was in front of the court.

22 Now, we made that point in our papers. There

23 was no response saying, no, wait, district judge, this isn't

24 the case. Rule on section 101.

25 Not a word.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 We had the same exchange in the Federal Circuit

2 and, once again, we pointed out this was 101, had been

3 waived six ways from Sunday. Not a response telling the

4 Federal Circuit, this isn't the case, please rule. And this

5 is important because you're being asked to tell trial court

6 and three courts of appeals judges that they committed

7 reversible error for failing to address a question that

8 nobody ever asked them.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: Now what do you say in

10 response to my question to the Solicitor General?

11 MR. ESTRADA: Which question, Justice Breyer?

12 I'm sorry.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: That they thought it was

14 obvious, that they thought that obviously the problem here

15 with this particular claim is that it doesn't say

16 specifically which tests this principle is meant to apply

17 to. So it isn't definite enough. It never occurred to

18 anyone that if you tried to apply it to every test, it was

19 somehow a valid patent, so they made it in the definitive

20 context. Because for 154 years, it's been clear that you

21 can't take a principle of nature like electricity and simply

22 make a claim for all uses of electricity to create letters.

23 That's their analogy.

24 And they thought by referring to the cases and

25 by referring to the failure to point out definitely what the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 tests were this applied to, it violated 112 because

2 otherwise, it wouldn't be a valid patent, which everyone in

3 the patent field would know. That's at least, I think, what

4 they're saying.

5 MR. ESTRADA: I think it is wrong on the facts

6 and on the law. If it was obvious all along this is an

7 affirmative defense under section 282 of the patent code,

8 that must be pleaded. One certainly can't be excused for

9 failing to plead something that, dare I say, is obvious.

10 But let's deal with the Morse case.

11 Mr. Franklin said it's the same statute at the time.

12 Actually, that is not so. At the time Morse was decided,

13 section 112 and 101 were both together in section 6 of the

14 1836 patent act. In 1870, Congress broke that off. That's

15 important because in Diehr, this Court considered a similar

16 issue with respect to the novelty requirement and concluded

17 that once Congress consciously wrote the novelty requirement

18 out of section 101, it was inappropriate to inject, you

19 know, the novelty considerations into section 101.

20 The second answer to the Morse question,

21 Justice Breyer, is that the test for definiteness is not is

22 this definite in the abstract, but is it really too broad in

23 relation to the inventive contribution as disclosed in the

24 specifications. And the contrast here that is important to

25 keep in mind is between Morse in 1854 and Alexander Graham

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Bell, claim 5 of that patent.

2 Just to set it up, in the Morse case, claim 8,

3 it had been known for many years that it was possible to

4 transmit using the electromagnetic current but nobody knew

5 how. And in fact, this Court's ruling on page 107 says this

6 was known by men of science everywhere. And the problem was

7 that Morse discovered one particular way to transmit

8 characters at a distance and tried to patent everything that

9 everybody might ever discover using whatever means to print

10 at a distance.

11 Alexander Graham Bell is a good contrast.

12 Claim 5. It was also known that you could use the

13 electronic current to transmit voice. People had tried and

14 tried and tried and, in fact, there was somebody in Germany

15 who successfully transmitted music but not words. This is

16 all in -- in the Court's opinion. Now, Graham Bell

17 discovered that the key was to use continuous undulations in

18 current. Continuous undulations, not discontinuous

19 undulations. And had a patent claim, claim 5, which was

20 very broad. All users of continuous undulations to transmit

21 voice or sound. The Court said that's absolutely right,

22 because he was not trying to claim beyond his inventive

23 contribution to the art.

24 Now, Drs. Stabler and Allen in this case

25 discovered something very important which is all of the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 medical tests that existed in the art as late as the 1880s

2 -- the 1980s were wrong. People were horribly misdiagnosed.

3 And there was a test that existed but nobody used. This is

4 what the record was.

5 The test for existing homocysteine was almost

6 never used, as Dr. Allen testified to this. There is

7 evidence in the record. This is why we have jury trials.

8 And what happened was this test was solely for attempting to

9 diagnose inherited enzyme defects. This is rare. Nobody

10 used it. There was not a market for it.

11 As a result of the discovery, the medical

12 community came around and concluded that everything they

13 were doing was wrong and the new test combining the

14 knowledge that it was possible to assay for homocysteine --

15 and by the way, the assaying means only measuring -- total

16 homocysteine with the discovery of the correlation could be

17 put together, as Diehr allows, to come up with a better

18 diagnostic test. And at the time, obviously, and this is,

19 again, in the trial testimony, no market for this. Nobody

20 wanted to do it. Everybody was just delighted with the

21 existing tests. And so Dr. Allen and Dr. Stabler had to set

22 up their own lab to do it.

23 It was after the medical community came around

24 that all of the lab companies became interested in doing

25 this commercially. And I go into this level of detail

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 because I think it is in part needed to answer the point

2 made by the Solicitor General. In a world in which there

3 was no commercial use for the existing prior art because it

4 was used rarely, and a market develops solely as a result of

5 people using the test to practice the invention, I think

6 it's analytically incorrect to say that we're trying to

7 monopolize the existing prior art. What has happened is

8 commercial laboratory companies like LabCorp are selling the

9 test to practice our invention. It was open to them to

10 say --

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but let me just interrupt.

12 The -- as I understand it, the alleged infringers don't use

13 the same novel process that you use in your assay, in other

14 words, step 1. They do not use the step 1 in claim 13, is

15 that correct?

16 MR. ESTRADA: Our -- yes and no. I think there

17 is an ambiguity in the question, Justice Stevens, because it

18 is true that the Abbott method --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, assume it's not Abbott.

20 Just say I come up with a novel method that's not covered by

21 the patent that I can get the assay results. And say a

22 doctor says, would you test the blood under your unpatented,

23 novel method and tell me what the results are?

24 MR. ESTRADA: All right.

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: And now if I do that and then

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the doctor looks at it and says I think you've got a vitamin B

2 deficiency, has he infringed your patent?

3 MR. ESTRADA: If the test was not ordered for

4 the purpose of diagnosing --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: It was ordered for the

6 purpose of letting the doctor know exactly what the assay

7 would be. Yes.

8 MR. ESTRADA: Well, unless --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: He hasn't --

10 MR. ESTRADA: -- there was a purpose for

11 diagnosing the deficiency, I would say no. And while we're

12 on the subject of engaging what our arguments have been all

13 along, we made clear in our brief, and nobody ever

14 responded, at page 38, that claim 13 is only infringed when

15 the assaying and the correlating steps are both performed

16 sequentially for the purpose of diagnosing vitamin B

17 deficiency.

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, a doctor asked me to

19 perform under my -- my own method, step 1, which I do it and

20 I give him the results and then he tells the patient, I

21 think you've got a vitamin B deficiency, in that case, he

22 has infringed, if I understand your argument.

23 MR. ESTRADA: If he did it for the purposes of

24 trying to determine whether you had a vitamin deficiency.

25 Now, if he did it for the purpose of trying to determine, as

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in the prior art, whether you had an inherited enzyme

2 condition, that would not be infringing. And this point was

3 addressed, obviously somewhat indirectly because it was

4 never raised in the court of appeals, by the Federal Circuit

5 at page 9a and 10a where the Federal Circuit explained the

6 correlating step was included as a limit for the intended

7 use of the test as a means to distinguish the intended use

8 for this test from the prior art.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: You're onto something, to me,

10 that is absolutely fundamental. You have millions of

11 doctors and scientists and computer people who are working

12 extremely hard to think of useful ideas and if you don't

13 give them an incentive, they may think of less.

14 MR. ESTRADA: Correct.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: And they're all useful. At

16 the same time, if you patent all of their ideas, including

17 very useful mini-micro principle ideas, you will establish

18 monopolies throughout this country beyond belief and it will

19 be difficult for people, without paying vast amounts of

20 money, to use their useful ideas.

21 So what principle do we use to separate the

22 scientific idea which can't be patented from the process

23 which can be? I thought that the claim was settled by

24 Morse, Flook and Diehr. Now would it make sense -- you can

25 answer any part of this question you want.

1 MR. ESTRADA: All right. Let me --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Would it make sense to send

3 this back and say, look, at least address their argument?

4 You can answer any part of that.

5 MR. ESTRADA: Three answers. Number one, under

6 the patent laws, everybody -- anybody who makes, uses or

7 sells the invention is potentially liable as an infringer.

8 Number two, Congress knows this and it knows that the people

9 who might be liable as infringers are doctors. It passed in

10 1996 section 287(c) of the patent law that gives doctors a

11 defense to infringement for certain things they do in their

12 offices, not this one. So Congress is perfectly aware of

13 all of the policy issues being raised and has chosen to give

14 an answer only so far.

15 The third is it is a fundamental misconception

16 to treat the case as though, even if the section 101 issue

17 is in front of the Court -- and it isn't -- whether the

18 issue is whether section 101 means that something is

19 actually patentable as opposed to what Diehr said, which is,

20 is it possibly patentable. This is subject matter

21 patentability. Is the mouth of the funnel, not the end of

22 the funnel, and all of the outlandish hypotheticals that we

23 have to deal about how this could be patented don't really

24 deal with the reality of the patent code, which is this is

25 the intake funnel. We have doctrines of obviousness,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 anticipation, 112, many other things, all of which were

2 raised at trial and the jury rejected in this case.

3 But the reason why there may be some

4 superficial appeal to the outlandish hypotheticals, Justice

5 Breyer, is because there is an effort to confuse the issue

6 that they're trying to smuggle belatedly into the case, 101,

7 as though it dealt with whether something is actually

8 patentable as opposed to potentially patentable. And on the

9 latter question, whether something is potentially

10 patentable, we have the extremely broad language of section

11 101 coupled by this Court's cases, in Chakrabarty and Diehr,

12 which said that what Congress intended is for anything under

13 the sun made by man to be potentially patentable. And if

14 there is some more precise policy issue why a particular

15 invention ought not to be patentable, it is found in section

16 102, 103, 112, other parts of the patent code, on which they

17 lost in front of the jury.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: What was made by man here?

19 What was made by man here? I mean, if you're

20 talking about the type of assay that your client developed,

21 which was involved in other claims, not in 13, then I'd

22 say, yes, that was made by man. But here, what 13 involves

23 is simply discovery of the natural principle that when one,

24 when there is the presence of one substance in a human

25 being, there is a deficiency of two other ones. That's just

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 a natural principle. What's made by man about that?

2 MR. ESTRADA: Well, the -- we don't contend that

3 the second step of the correlation is independently

4 patentable even though the argument is framed as a --

5 argument. What we contend is patentable and what's allowed

6 by Diehr is the inventive spark of putting together the

7 discovery of the correlation with a way found elsewhere to

8 measure these important bodily chemicals to produce a

9 diagnostic test.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: A way found elsewhere if

11 indeed the Federal Circuit had determined the second step,

12 you know, step 1, do the assay, step 2, correlate. If the

13 Federal Circuit had said, oh, that requires your using a

14 scale to see how much of one there is and how little of the

15 other, but this Federal Circuit says, all correlate means is

16 be aware of the fact that when one substance is high, the

17 other two are going to be low. That's all it means.

18 MR. ESTRADA: Well, that's unfair to the Federal

19 Circuit on two points. Number one, it was very clear to the

20 Federal Circuit, and in fact I think they said that, I can't

21 put my hand on the page, where they said, there is no issue

22 here about step number one. All that people are fighting

23 about is the correlating step and what it means.

24 And the problem that LabCorp had in the Federal

25 Circuit with respect to the correlating step, which is a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 question they tried to bring up and was cert denied, is that

2 they proposed in the district court the definition that was

3 used by the Federal Circuit, which is a mutual or reciprocal

4 relationship between an elevated level and the vitamin. And

5 so having proposed that, it actually makes sense as a

6 diagnostic test, as the Federal Circuit pointed out with the

7 example of the pregnancy test.

8 Now, Justice Scalia, you asked a question

9 earlier --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, please don't get off it --

11 because this is my biggest problem with the case. I agree

12 that what you've said is simply a statement of the natural

13 phenomenon, that when the one substance is high, the other

14 two are low. And simply to be aware of that natural

15 phenomenon is all that correlation consists of.

16 MR. ESTRADA: Well, it is true but is not

17 necessarily the case that being aware of a natural

18 phenomenon or of a correlation leads you inevitably to an

19 inventive diagnostic test. There is a correlation between

20 being tall and being -- you know, between height and weight.

21 If I tell you that somebody's coming to visit you who is 250

22 pounds, that person is probably not a five year-old. But that

23 gets me nowhere in terms of turning that into useful knowledge

24 that could be patentable.

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you do agree, do you

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 not, that step 2 by itself would not be patentable?

2 MR. ESTRADA: I do agree with that, Justice

3 Stevens.

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: Your point is that even

5 though step 2 is performed as the second step of step 1

6 which is also not patentable, you get together for the

7 patent?

8 MR. ESTRADA: That's true. And if you look at

9 the Diehr case, it's a perfect example because Diehr had

10 more steps but it was absolutely true in Diehr that every

11 single step, including the mathematical equation, was part

12 of the prior art. And this Court said that's potentially

13 patentable because you have found a way to put all these

14 disparate things together in a way that makes

15 them potentially useful.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: Does that fall within it?

17 I mean, I can't resist pointing, as one of these briefs

18 did, the phrase anything under the sun that is made by

19 man comes from a committee report that said something

20 different. It said a person may have invented a machine or

21 a manufacture, which may include anything under the sun that

22 is made by man.

23 So referring to that doesn't help solve the

24 problem where we're not talking about a machine or a

25 manufacture. Rather we are talking about what has to be

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 done in order to make an abstract idea fall within the

2 patent act. Now, sometimes you can make that happen by

3 connecting it with some physical things in the world and

4 sometimes you can't.

5 MR. ESTRADA: But Justice Breyer --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: And if you have a clear

7 statement other than Diehr, Flook, Morse, which draws that

8 line properly, let me know.

9 MR. ESTRADA: I think the telephone cases, Bell

10 and Diehr, are cases that absolutely show that under this

11 Court's cases, this is patentable subject matter. Again,

12 we're talking about the mouth of the funnel, not the end of

13 the funnel.

14 But let me point something else, Justice

15 Breyer, which is it came from a committee report but it's

16 already been incorporated in this Court's cases in

17 Chakrabarty and in Diehr as exemplary of Congress'

18 determination to have the mouth of the funnel be very wide.

19 And if there are problems with something being ultimately

20 patentable, they are because there is some other requirement

21 of the patent law that -- that -- that should be looked at.

22 One of the other points on the question that

23 Justice Scalia asked, because I think it is important on

24 whether this question is before the Court, is that the rules

25 of this Court, rule 14(1)(f) mandated the petition shall

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 contain, quote, the statutes involved in the case set out

2 verbatim. And you can pick up the cert petition and indeed

3 there is an appendix which is at the very last page of the

4 petition, and you can look at it and it says, pertinent

5 statutory provisions. There are two statutes, section 112

6 and section 271. You can pick up their blue brief and do

7 the same with the back flap, and we have the fishes and the

8 loaves.

9 Now they have three statutes, 101, 112 and 271.

10 There is no way to construe their question 3 as having been

11 intended all along to encompass a very separate affirmative

12 defense that they never put in front of the trial court or

13 the Federal Circuit.

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would the case be different

15 if they quoted section 101 in their appendix?

16 MR. ESTRADA: Yes, I think it would be

17 different, Justice Stevens, because then their argument that

18 this was encompassed within one of the questions in the

19 petition might have some surface plausibility. But it

20 doesn't.

21 Let me just go back and link that point with

22 another aspect of our legal system, which is you see cases

23 of forfeiture and waiver all the time. This term in

24 Unitherm and in Arbaugh, you have already said twice that

25 parties should be held responsible for their procedural

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 defaults. You do that in other areas of the law.

2 And the one that came to mind, to my mind as I

3 was thinking about this case, Justice Stevens, is going all

4 the way back to Wainwright versus Sykes, because you have

5 cases every year involving habeas corpus, where Wainwright

6 versus Sykes says we have to be careful about sandbagging,

7 and we're going to presume that an indigent defendant on

8 trial for his life in a rural county someplace with a lawyer

9 two years out of law school, who can't find the courthouse,

10 consciously chose to save the federal claims so that he

11 could assert later, have it in his back pocket: We're going

12 to have a rule of forfeiture for sandbagging.

13 Empirically, one may well wonder whether that

14 is empirically likely to be true in a great number of cases.

15 But we don't have to wonder in this case because every well

16 advised corporate defendant, if I am their lawyer, I will

17 advise them to hold this in the back pocket and to have a

18 second trip to the trial court and the court of appeals

19 because in the rules in affirmative defense, rule 8 says you

20 have to plead it and the statute says you have to prove it.

21 And it went all the way up the ladder.

22 And if you tell them that they get to start all

23 over again, what you will have is every well advised

24 corporate defendant will be advised by counsel, like me and

25 by Mr. Franklin, that the way to do is to tire the inventor

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 out, have a trial and then we can start all over again. And

2 that's no way to run a legal system, especially when they're

3 coming with the most important questions of patent law to

4 this Court with incredibly far-reaching implications and the

5 best that they can say to the Court about why you shouldn't

6 worry about the consequences is, as they say in the closing

7 pages of the reply brief, rule for us and every other case

8 will have to be considered on its own merits. Which I guess

9 is true as far as it goes but it's about as helpful as

10 telling the Patent Office and the lower courts that life is

11 a fountain. And you know, this Court does not sit to

12 issue --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean life isn't a

14 fountain?

15 (Laughter.)

16 MR. ESTRADA: I didn't say it wasn't. I just

17 said that the expression of that thought is not helpful.

18 And insofar as this Court sits to advise the lower courts

19 and the government and the patents office and the investing

20 community who could swing billions of dollars on the basis

21 of an issue that was never litigated in the lower courts, I

22 frankly submit, Justice Scalia, that it would be

23 irresponsible for the Court to reach out and deal with a

24 question for which there was never an adequate factual

25 predicate.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: And Wainwright against Sykes

2 was even decided before AEDPA was passed, too.

3 MR. ESTRADA: Exactly. And Congress actually

4 implemented that in AEDPA. And so my basic point, Justice

5 Stevens, is if that the legal system takes the procedural

6 regularity of our courts seriously enough to enforce them in

7 what would seem to some people to be pretty compelling

8 circumstances of life and death, there is little claim on

9 the legal system for a well heeled corporate defendant who

10 has been adjudged to be a willful infringer by a jury to

11 come to this Court and asked to be put in the starting gate

12 again. There is no way that -- again, that is no way to

13 deal with the legal system.

14 I have nothing further, Justice Stevens.

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Estrada.

16 Mr. Franklin, I think you have about four and a

17 half minutes left.

18 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN

19 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20 MR. FRANKLIN: Hopefully I won't, I won't have

21 to use all that.

22 Just a few points, Your Honors. There was a

23 suggestion made that it matters what purpose these tests

24 were undertaken for. That is not true. We had argued

25 extensively that it did matter, that in fact the doctors

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 were using this for not detecting vitamin deficiencies but

2 for detecting heart disease. That was not -- we were not

3 successful on that. What the court of appeals said was any

4 doctor on pain of malpractice will necessarily perform the

5 correlating every time that doctor looks at a test result.

6 So it doesn't matter why the doctor does that.

7 Second, Morse was clearly a case decided under

8 what is now section 112. I think Mr. Hungar admitted that.

9 The language of the case makes that clear. It quotes the

10 relevant statute, and all of this is in our reply brief, and

11 it concludes that the patent in that case was overbroad

12 because it didn't, it contravened what is now section 112

13 and that is how we argued --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Weren't 112 and 101 combined

15 at that time?

16 MR. FRANKLIN: They were.

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you disagree with that?

18 MR. FRANKLIN: No, I don't. He is correct on

19 that. But look at the case and how it was decided. It was

20 decided on the basis of what is now section 112. We have

21 cited numerous cases in the lower courts that have

22 interpreted it that way. And I believe Mr. Hungar admitted

23 that too.

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't want to take up your

25 time on rebuttal but I have to ask you, do you have an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 explanation for not quoting section 101 in your papers?

2 MR. FRANKLIN: I think the explanation is that

3 we cited all of the cases -- for example, Mackay Radio is a

4 case we cited that doesn't itself cite 101. The Court

5 itself never cited 101 in these cases until 1972. It was a

6 judicially created exception for laws of nature and natural

7 phenomena. And of course to the extent it is applicable

8 here, it is applicable either on its own, but also in

9 connection with and as a natural predicate to the 112

10 inquiry. And there I think the analogy to Morse is quite

11 striking. And what -- in Morse, the Court said that he

12 could not monopolize all devices and processes used to

13 transmit the characters at a distance through the natural

14 phenomenon of electromagnetism.

15 Here what these patentees are seeking to do

16 is to monopolize all homocysteine tests that are used to, as

17 they say, detect vitamin deficiencies through the natural

18 correlation that they recite. Morse couldn't do that

19 because it wasn't limited to the one device that he actually

20 invented. Here they cannot do it because it's not limited

21 to the one homocysteine assay that they in fact invented,

22 that we use and that we pay royalties on every time we use.

23 Finally, I think that the primary gatekeepers

24 here on these kinds of things is the Patent & Trademark

25 Office. I think they're trying their best, but what I heard

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 from their representative today is that they're not prepared

2 to do anything about these kinds of patents unless this

3 Court gives them further guidance. We are only asking that

4 the Court give them further guidance on this patent and to

5 say that a patent that claims nothing more than a natural

6 correlation preceded by the inherent and generic step of

7 measuring the input for that correlation is invalid and the

8 judgment that is based upon it should also be reversed.

9 Thank you, Your Honors.

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you. The case is

11 submitted.

12 (Whereupon, at 12:11 p.m., the case in the

13 above-titled matter was submitted.)
