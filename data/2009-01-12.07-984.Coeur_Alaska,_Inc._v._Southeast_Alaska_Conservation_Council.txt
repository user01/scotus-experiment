1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument first this morning in Case 07-984, Coeur Alaska 5 v. The Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, and Case 6 07-990, Alaska v. The Southeast Alaska Conservation 7 Council. 8 General Garre. 9 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE 10 ON BEHALF OF FEDERAL RESPONDENTS, 11 IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS 12 GENERAL GARRE: Thank you, 13 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 14 The expert agencies charged by Congress with 15 implementing the Clean Water Act have concluded that the 16 discharge of fill material, like the mine tailings at 17 issue in this case, should be permitted by the Army 18 Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the Act, and are 19 not -- are not subject to the effluent guidelines 20 applicable to permits issued by the EPA under section 21 402 of the Act. 22 That interpretation is grounded on more than 23 three decades of agency pronouncements and reflects the 24 collective judgment and expertise of the Army Corps of 25 Engineers and the EPA in administering the Act.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the discharge comes 2 from a single pipe, is it always one or the other, or 3 can it ever be both fill and -4 GENERAL GARRE: Justice Kennedy, it's always 5 one or the other. The Clean Water Act establishes two 6 permitting regimes. And I think this is actually 7 something where the parties agree. Either it's going to 8 be permitted under section 402 of the Act, which covers 9 pollutants generally but not the discharge of dredged 10 material, or fill material, which is covered by section 11 404 of the Act. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a legal 13 answer to Justice Kennedy's question. What is the 14 physical answer? Can a pipe both emit sludge, fill, and 15 effluent? 16 GENERAL GARRE: As a practical matter, for 17 example, if you take the slurry in this case, which is 18 55 percent solid by volume, there is going to be liquid 19 coming out of that pipe with the slurry, but under the 20 definition that the agencies administer of fill 21 material, this is fill material under that definition. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Fill material trumps 23 effluent, in other words? 24 GENERAL GARRE: Fill material trumps 25 effluent. That's --

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it does -- here's the 2 problem that I am having and I think others may have. 3 We start, number one, with a definition, as I understand 4 it, of a pollutant that includes suspended solids. 5 Number two, there is an existing regulation to the 6 effect that wastewater from this particular method of 7 extracting gold shall simply not be released, shall not 8 be put into a water body. And then the two agencies 9 come along and in effect they say by regulation, if the 10 suspended solid in effect comes out of a mine, or if the 11 wastewater has got suspended solid in it, we are going 12 to call it "fill" and leave it entirely to the Army 13 Engineers under 404, subject to an EPA veto. 14 And on the face of it, it sounds as though 15 they are simply, number one, defining one -- one variant 16 of pollution out of the EPA's jurisdiction, and, number 17 two, with respect to the wastewater, in effect coming up 18 with a contradictory determination about what should be 19 done with it. 20 And it sounds as though, under the 21 Administrative Procedure Act, that with the statutory 22 and the regulatory regime on the one hand and this joint 23 regulation on the other, you've simply got a flat 24 contradiction, and query whether that can be anything 25 other than arbitrary and capricious under the APA. Will

1 you address that? 2 GENERAL GARRE: Sure, Justice Souter. First 3 of all, I those concerns really go to the definition of 4 "fill material," and I don't think that the Respondent 5 SEACC has squarely challenged that definition in this 6 case. And I would point you to two parts of the record. 7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's assume -- and I 8 don't mean to cut you off there, but before you're done 9 -- I am at least raising it because I find it very 10 difficult to get a handle on this case without dealing 11 with that problem. So you may say, well, they didn't 12 raise it well enough, but I still want you to deal with 13 it on the merits. 14 GENERAL GARRE: Sure. And let me just point 15 to the two parts of the record: The JA at 541 note 12, 16 where the Ninth Circuit acknowledged they didn't 17 challenge it; and also I would point you to the 18 complaint, where the complaint is directed to the 19 permits and does not seek a determination that the Fill 20 Rule definition is arbitrary and capricious. 21 We think that that definition reflects the 22 settled understanding and expertise of both agencies, 23 the Army Corps of Engineers -24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could it be settled, 25 because isn't it a fact that before 2002 if the primary
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 purpose was disposing of waste that the 402 permit 2 applied? 3 GENERAL GARRE: That is correct, 4 Justice Ginsburg. By "settled," I mean it was settled 5 in 2002. They adopted this rule. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's not in 30 years' 7 experience, and when it was disposing of waste, it was 8 under 402 until 2002. 9 GENERAL GARRE: I think the EPA has always 10 adopted and applied an effects test for determining 11 whether or not a discharge is fill material -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in fact, was there 13 ever a permit by the Corps of Engineers when the purpose 14 was disposal of waste? Was there ever a 404 permit, 15 rather than a 402, for disposal of what they call 16 "processed wastewater" or "wastewater"? 17 GENERAL GARRE: There was a period, of 18 course, Justice Ginsburg -- you are right -- where the 19 Army Corps of Engineers adopted a primary purpose test. 20 During that period -- you are right -- 404 permits were 21 not -- were not issued for the discharge of things where 22 the purpose was not to fill the lake; it was to dispose 23 of material. 24 Now, during that period, though, those 25 discharges were not regulated under section 402 of the
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Act and under Section 306, the effluent guidelines, but 2 for a different reason. The reason why that they 3 weren't regulated under 402 during that period is 4 because of the agencies' wastewater treatment exception, 5 which is found at 40 C.F.R. 122.2, where the agencies 6 excepted from the definition of the "waters of the 7 United States" discharges into an impoundment area. 8 And what you have going on here is the 9 discharge of fill material into an impoundment area, 10 which is dammed off with a 50-foot dam. Those 11 discharges, in this case, are governed by section 404 of 12 the Act. But any discharges from that impoundment area 13 into downstream waters of the United States are subject 14 to section 402 of the Act -- there's a separate permit 15 in this case -- and are subject to the effluent 16 guidelines and the new source performance standards. 17 So you have those two. The agencies have 18 come together. They've reconciled the statutory 19 regimes, and they have the 404 permit of dredged 20 material, material that's going to fill the bottom of 21 the lake, raise it by 50 feet, governed by section 404 22 of the Act. That impoundment area then is sealed off, 23 and any discharged material out of that impoundment area 24 into waters of the United States is going to be governed 25 by 402 and the separate effluent guidelines there. That

1 -2 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's pretty cold comfort 3 when you treat as an impoundment area a natural lake. I 4 suppose if the -- if it's proper to do what they're 5 doing here, then the lake in the middle of the 6 Everglades is an impoundment area, or a Great Salt Lake 7 is an impoundment area. 8 GENERAL GARRE: Well, any -- we're talking 9 about -10 JUSTICE SOUTER: This is a long way from a 11 settling pond. 12 GENERAL GARRE: Well, let me address that in 13 two different ways: First of all, at the end of this 14 project, when the lake is going to be reclaimed, the 15 agencies determined that it's going to be 16 environmentally as sound, if not superior, for the 17 habitats in Alaska, fish and wildlife. So at the end of 18 the project, it is going to be -19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but what's that -20 what's that got to do with the definition of 21 "impoundment area"? My problem is that you are 22 treating -- the Corps is treating as an impoundment area 23 a whole natural lake as distinct from a settling basin. 24 GENERAL GARRE: The statute refers to 25 specified disposal sites and what you have here, you are
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 right, is a lake. But it's impounded by a 50-foot dam. 2 The other part I wanted to point to is the section 404 3 guidelines are rigorous environmental guidelines that 4 address a number of different concerns, including the 5 quality of the water, the fish and wildlife habitat, and 6 at the end of that process you have got the EPA, which 7 has the right to exercise a veto over -8 JUSTICE SOUTER: You keep saying they are 9 rigorous. My understanding is -- and I didn't think it 10 was seriously disputed here -- is that during the period 11 in which the deposits are going to be made, the natural 12 life of this water body is going to be destroyed. 13 GENERAL GARRE: That's true. 14 JUSTICE SOUTER: And the Corps comes along 15 and says, oh, when it's all over, it will come back. 16 But when you're destroying the entire living sort of 17 corpus of this lake, it seems to me that it's getting 18 more lenient to say that there are rigorous 19 environmental standards. 20 GENERAL GARRE: That's true, Justice Souter, 21 but it's important to keep in mind that the reason why 22 the lake -- the fish in the lake are not going to 23 survive is because of the fill effect of the material, 24 not because of any toxics put into the water. 25 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but as I understand it,
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and you correct me if I am wrong here, I thought 2 "suspended solids," I guess is the buzz word for it, is 3 a form of pollution. So you're saying, well, we're 4 destroying the fish with one form of pollution rather 5 than another form of pollution. And I don't know that 6 that advances the ball for your side. 7 GENERAL GARRE: Any time you have fill 8 material going into the waters of the United States -9 of course, section 404 doesn't apply until you've got 10 fill material going into the waters of the United 11 States. 12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but this comes back to 13 my initial question. You are simply, or the Corps is 14 simply, defining what would otherwise be a pollutant, 15 suspended solids discharged into the water, by calling 16 it fill material. And it -- in effect it's defining one 17 subject of -- of discharge regulation right out of the 18 law of the United States by redefining it and saying, 19 oh, it doesn't exist if it's coming out of a mine. 20 GENERAL GARRE: I think what the agencies 21 have done to reconcile their definitions is to apply 22 this effects test. Now, if Coeur Alaska sought to fill 23 the entire lake -24 JUSTICE SOUTER: But to apply the effects 25 test, the legal effect, is it not, is to define one form
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of pollution as no longer existent so long as that form 2 of pollution falls within the Corps of Engineers 3 definition of "fill." 4 GENERAL GARRE: I don't think that's 5 correct. 6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that correct? 7 GENERAL GARRE: The legal effect is to 8 regulate that pollution under section 404. 9 JUSTICE ALITO: General Garre, I don't want 10 to take up your rebuttal time, but what's the 11 environmental alternative to what was done here? 12 GENERAL GARRE: The primary environmental 13 alternative considered was a dry tailings alternative. 14 And that would be been problematic in two different 15 ways. One, it would have required the destruction of 16 some 100 acres of wetlands; and two, it would have 17 resulted in enormous stacks of tailings, 100 to 200 18 high, thousands of feet wide, that would actually dwarf 19 the Pentagon and be visible from nearby Berners Bay. 20 Now, the Army Corps of Engineers, the State 21 of Alaska, and the Forest Service determined that the 22 wet tailings option, putting the tailings into a lake, 23 and reclaiming that lake so that it would be 24 environmentally superior, was the preferable option. 25 I do want to emphasize that if this Court
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 has any doubt about the statutory text the regulatory 2 decisions here go back more than 30 years. In 1973 the 3 EPA adopted a rule that said that the discharge of fill 4 material is not regulated under the section 402 5 permitting system. In 2002, in the preamble to the fill 6 rule, the agency made clear again EPA has never 7 regulated the discharge of fill material under the 8 effluent guidelines. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Weren't they then 10 thinking of fill material as material that was used 11 either to fill in, to reclaim land, or in a construction 12 project? I mean, to call filling a lake, to call that a 13 fill, when what it's doing is providing a disposal place 14 for a mining operation, it's not what one ordinarily 15 thinks of as a filling operation. 16 GENERAL GARRE: Not the Environmental 17 Protection Agency. The Environmental Protection Agency 18 since the passage of the Clean Water Act has taken the 19 position that discharge that has the effect of changing 20 the bottom elevation of a water is going to be fill. 21 And that makes sense as a practical matter. The 22 agencies with 30 years of experience determined that the 23 purpose definition that the Corps had adopted for a 24 period was unworkable, unpredictable and didn't make 25 sense. And I think that if there's any judgment that
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the courts ought to defer to here, it's the judgment of 2 the agencies based on their collective experience as to 3 the proper definition of "fill material." 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's one question that 5 Justice Souter raised and before you sit down I would 6 like to get your answer, and that is, can anything, any 7 water of the United States that the Corps of Engineers 8 decides is appropriate to be used as a disposal place, 9 can any waterway be a settling pond? That is, here we 10 have a lake. And is it just up to the Corps of 11 Engineers? They say this is a settling pond, it's a 12 settling pond? 13 GENERAL GARRE: I think as a practical 14 matter if you put discharge into a river and it may not 15 change the bottom elevation, that wouldn't be fill 16 material. But, Justice Ginsburg, there have been a 17 number of hypotheticals raised by Respondents here. Let 18 me address those. The section 404 process is a rigorous 19 environmental process, the EPA does have veto authority. 20 We haven't seen these problems at all in the six years 21 that the fill definition has been in place and I think 22 it's simply untenable to suggest that these standards, 23 which in section 4 require water quality determinations, 24 wildlife, aquatic determination, would result in the 25 sort of environmental harm that Respondents have
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 hypothesized, and the prospect of that harm is no basis 2 for this Court to override the statutory scheme that 3 Congress created with two distinct permitting regimes, 4 one for fill material, one for other pollutants, and to 5 override the agency's pronouncements, interpretations 6 for more than 30 years. 7 And the other agency document I wanted to 8 point to is very important. It's the 2004 mine tailings 9 memorandum, which is contained at JA-141 to 146. In 10 that memorandum, which is a 2004 memo by the heads of 11 the EPA water divisions, they explain the application of 12 the statutory and the regulatory scheme to these types 13 of discharges, discharges that fill material into the 14 impoundment is going to be subject to 404 and the 15 rigorous process there. Any discharges out of that 16 impoundment area is going to be subject to the rigorous 17 requirements of 402 and that agency interpretation is 18 entitled to deference. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General. 20 GENERAL GARRE: Thank you, Your Honor. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Olson. 22 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON 23 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 24 MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 25 please the Court: Let me reemphasize one point. The
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Clean Water Act itself, Congress created two distinct, 2 mutually exclusive but complementary permitting regimes. 3 One is fill material, which is governed by, administered 4 by the Corps of Engineers. The other is "other, except 5 as permitted under section 404," administered by the 6 EPA. 7 A discharge, in answer to your question, 8 Justice Kennedy, may be governed by one program or the 9 other, not both. Everybody admits that, including the 10 Respondents. 11 The fill rule -12 JUSTICE STEVENS: But doesn't the EPA have a 13 veto power over the fill material permit? 14 MR. OLSON: Yes, it does, Justice Stevens. 15 JUSTICE STEVENS: So they're not totally 16 mutually exclusive. 17 MR. OLSON: It's mutually exclusive in terms 18 of the issuing agency, and I think that's a very 19 important point. We want to emphasize that, that the 20 rules pursuant to which the Corps of Engineers 21 administers the fill permit are the 404(b)(1) rules 22 which Congress specified to be enacted by the EPA. So 23 the rigorous rules governing the quality of the water 24 that's going to be affected by these fill permits are 25 established by the EPA.

1 Furthermore, the State is involved, the 2 fisheries departments are involved, the conservation 3 area of the State of Alaska. Many different agencies 4 are involved in this permitting process. The permits in 5 this case followed 900 studies, the expenditure of $26 6 million, an evaluation by the EPA, the Corps of 7 Engineers, the department of conservation of Alaska, 8 and, Justice Stevens' point, finally before the permit 9 could be issued it had to go to the EPA and the EPA had 10 the power to veto the permit. 11 Now, Congress determined -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could they veto it 13 due to its failure to comply with effluent limitations? 14 MR. OLSON: No, they could not do that, 15 Justice -- Chief Justice Roberts, because the -16 Congress made a choice under sections 404 and 402. 17 Section 402, the EPA program, is governed by those 18 effluent limitations under 301 and 306 and standards of 19 performance. 20 Congress made a choice of applying section 21 307, which are toxic effluent limitations that apply to 22 the 404 permits. That 307 regime which Congress 23 selected, which is also endorsed by the EPA in the rules 24 that the -- that the Corps must follow in administering 25 the permit -- that 307 provision to which I just
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 referred to is in the 404(b)(1) regime rules. So all of 2 this, the permitting process, which Congress made the 3 decision to put into two baskets: Either it's fill 4 material or it's except permits under -5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What happens if the 6 agencies disagree as to whether it's fill? If 404 says 7 it's fill, EPA says it isn't, can the EPA then veto it 8 on that ground? 9 MR. OLSON: The -- the -- yes. I -- I think 10 the answer to that is yes. But the better answer to 11 that, Justice Kennedy, is for a while, as -- as General 12 Garre pointed out, the EPA had a different concept of 13 what was fill than the Corps of Engineers. The EPA 14 right from the beginning said it would be the effect on 15 the -- on the water. 16 The Corps for a while had that definition. 17 Then it used a purpose test. Both agencies, the EPA and 18 the Army Corps of Engineers, agreed in 2002 that that 19 "purpose" definition of the word "fill" was not 20 workable. It was too subjective. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there are still going 22 to be cases, I would assume very close cases, even under 23 the present standard, where there could be disagreement. 24 MR. OLSON: Well, there could be 25 disagreement, but I was just about to say that this rule
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 was jointly adopted by the Corps of Engineers and the 2 EPA in 2002. To the extent there is any ambiguity as to 3 what fill material is, both the Army Corps of Engineers 4 and the EPA agree that it includes slurry from mines. 5 So that -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The definition that was 7 adopted, if I have it right, was the EPA definition. 8 That was the effect. And it was the Corps that had the 9 purpose test. And yet, until 2002, if I understand 10 correctly, if the only reason of raising the elevation 11 of the lake was to dispose of waste, you didn't get a 12 404 permit. That was not a 404 situation until 2002. 13 MR. OLSON: That's -- that's -- except in 14 the early stage, as I understand it, the Corps and -15 the Corps also used the "effects" test. Then there was 16 a period of time when it used a "purpose" test. The EPA 17 consistently used the -- the "effects" test. In -18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in an application 19 that never included filling a lake, raising the 20 elevation of a lake simply for the purpose of disposing 21 of waste. 22 MR. OLSON: That's -- that's -- until that 23 point, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. But the two 24 agencies that were involved in this process determined 25 that that was not a workable test. It didn't function
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 well. It allowed too much evasion and -- and 2 manipulation, and they both came together after long 3 studies and decided a reasonable interpretation that was 4 effective, consistent, and workable. 5 Under the Clean Water Act, both agencies 6 came together and decided that the definition included 7 the placement of overburden, slurry, tailings, or 8 similar mining-related materials. 9 Now, to the extent there is any ambiguity in 10 the statute, this is the reasoned judgment, notice-and11 comment rulemaking by the two agencies given 12 responsibility. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I perhaps am missing 14 this. I -- this is in general what I don't understand, 15 how this works. My understanding is that under 404 16 something is "fill" -- they have a definition. And it's 17 "fill," among other things, if it changes the bottom 18 level of any portion of water in the United States. Is 19 that right? 20 MR. OLSON: That's correct. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: And somewhere I have the 22 idea -- but I can't find it in the briefs now -- that it 23 has to raise the bottom level by 55 feet. 24 MR. OLSON: No, I don't -- that does not -25 JUSTICE BREYER: There is some number of
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 feet. 2 MR. OLSON: I don't know where you got that. 3 That is the result in this case. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the result of this 5 case. But, anyway, it raises the level. I guess it has 6 to raise it some significant amount. All right. So 7 what happens in this situation? 8 Let us think of the worst pollutant you can 9 think of. Think of that. I don't know what it is. 10 Maybe it's saturated fat in potato chips, something 11 absolutely terrible. 12 MR. OLSON: Cholesterol. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. We are going to 14 think of that pollutant. And now let's suppose that 15 with the agreement of the Army Corps of Engineers a 16 company takes this pollutant, which is the worst one you 17 could think of, that the EPA would never let you go 18 within 50 feet of it, and they take it, and they fill a 19 lake with it up to the level of 55 feet, or 20 feet, or 20 whatever number of feet. 21 I mean, it just can't be that simply because 22 they poured a lot of it in and it fills up the bottom of 23 the lake that suddenly the EPA can't regulate it any 24 more. Now, that -- that -- since that's so 25 counterintuitive, that all you have to do is take a
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 terrible pollutant and fill the bottom of the lake with 2 it and now it's up to the Army Corps of Engineers and 3 not up to the EPA -- that's so counterintuitive that I 4 assume I don't understand the statute, and you will 5 explain it to me. 6 MR. OLSON: Yes, I will, Justice Breyer. If 7 it's fill, the administrating, permitting agency is the 8 Army Corps of Engineers. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh. 10 MR. OLSON: But in granting that permit, in 11 evaluating that permit, they must follow the 404(b)(1) 12 guidelines that were drafted and written by the EPA. So 13 that -- and EPA has all sorts of provisions. It can't 14 have an adverse effect on the water. There cannot be a 15 preferable environmental alternative. It must go 16 through the Marine Fisheries. It cannot contain that 17 toxic material that you are talking about, that worst 18 material in the world. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it can contain it so 20 long as it is -- as it -- as it is not transitory. 21 MR. OLSON: No -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, isn't it arguable 23 that the best place for -- for really toxic stuff is at 24 the bottom of a lake so long as it stays there and is 25 not carried --
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. OLSON: That -- that may be, but the 2 Rule 404(b)(1) guidelines address both that point, and I 3 understand your point, too. But in -- on 11(a) of the 4 Government's brief the -- the 404(b)(1) guidelines are 5 set forth, and it includes a provision, number 2 on that 6 page, "violates any applicable toxic effluent standard 7 or prohibition under section 307 of the Act."

OLSON: Pardon me? 13 JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I heard you say before 14 that it was not identical. That -- I mean if, of 15 course, EPA takes all its regs and applies those regs 16 when the Army Corps of Engineers considers a permit 17 under 404 so that you couldn't get an Army Corps of 18 Engineers permit unless you complied with the 402 19 etcetera regs, then this all could come to nothing. 20 MR.

It's inert material. It does not changing 5 the chemical composition. It is not hurting the water 6 quality of the lake. 7 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's going to kill 8 every living creature in the lake, right? 9 MR. OLSON: Putting sand or rocks -10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Wait a minute. It is going 11 to kill everything in the lake. 12 MR. OLSON: Yes, it is, Justice Souter. 13 Putting sand in the bottom of the lake is going to do 14 that. They are going to reintroduce the fish. It will 15 be a bigger lake with a better aquatic system when it's 16 finished. But, yes, you are correct, in the interim the 17 sand at the bottom of the lake will kill those fish. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how do we know that 19 life will ever be restored?

OLSON: It's a -- it's a condition for 22 the permit, and every agency which examined this, 23 including the Fisheries Department, the -- the 24 conservation agencies of the State of Alaska -- and 25 specifically said in the administrative record that

WALDO 10 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 11 MR. WALDO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 12 please the Court: 13 In section 306(e), Congress enacted an 14 unqualified prohibition against operating any new source 15 in violation of any standard of performance applicable 16 to the source. The standard of performance at issue in 17 this case is applicable on its face to the formula at 18 the Kensington mine. It says there shall be no 19 discharge of processed wastewater into navigable waters 20 from mills that use the froth-flotation process. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the 22 provision that authorizes permits begins by saying 23 "Except as provided in sections 1328 and 1344," and 1344 24 is 404. So why doesn't that just take the 404 regime 25 completely out of what you were just talking about?
27
Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. WALDO: Because that's only a statement 2 about whether section 402 applies. It means that if you 3 have a section 404 permit, you don't also need a section 4 402 permit. It doesn't say anything about whether a 404 5 permit is appropriate under any particular 6 circumstances, and it doesn't say anything about whether 7 section 306 is applicable. In fact -8 JUSTICE ALITO: The standard has to be -9 the standard has to be applicable and this is an EPA 10 regulation, isn't it? 11 MR. WALDO: Yes. 12 JUSTICE ALITO: And the EPA has said this 13 isn't applicable to this situation. 14 MR. WALDO: But that determination was based 15 on a misinterpretation of the Clean Water Act. That 16 prefatory clause that the Chief Justice was asking about 17 doesn't say anything about whether section 306 applies. 18 306 does not have a prefatory clause like that, which 19 strongly suggests that it's not intended to apply there. 20 In other -21 JUSTICE ALITO: So your position requires us 22 to determine that EPA's interpretation of those, the 23 statutory regime that you are talking about, 306 and 24 402, is contrary to the statute? 25 MR. WALDO: That the interpretation as it's
28

1 presented in this case is contrary to the statute. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: If EPA were to amend the 3 performance standard to say that it doesn't apply in the 4 situation in which the fill rule applies, would that be 5 a valid regulation? 6 MR. WALDO: Well, I doubt that EPA could -7 could lawfully under the Clean Water Act enact such a 8 thing, because the Clean Water Act requires EPA to 9 regulate suspended solids and EPA has always regulated 10 suspended solids through effluent limitations. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could the -- could the EPA 12 allow a point source to discharge sand slurry -- there's 13 nothing in it but sand -- into a river? Wouldn't you 14 have to -- wouldn't you need some permission from the 15 EPA to do that? Wouldn't that violate the Act? 16 MR. WALDO: If it -- I'm sorry, so it -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: I want to discharge. I 18 have a pipe and there is sand on my land which is being 19 washed away. I'm discharging all that sand into a 20 river. 21 MR. WALDO: Yes -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would that violate -23 MR.

WALDO: Well, the Corps of Engineers has 8 the authority under section 404 to grant fill material 9 permits -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though it violates 11 effluent standards. 12 MR. WALDO: No, not when it violates 13 effluent standards. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you say -- you say that 15 if you discharge sand into -- into a river it violates 16 effluent standards. 17 MR. WALDO: Oh, that doesn't -- oh, I'm 18 sorry. I didn't understand that part of your question. 19 Yes, if -- if there is an effluent limitation for a 20 particular source -- remember, effluent limitations are 21 adopted for industrial sources, so you would have to 22 look at what the source of that discharge was. 23 And if EPA had identified that source, a 24 particular kind of factory of some kind, a mill, you 25 know, a leather tanning facility or something like that,

1 if EPA had adopted effluent limitations that were 2 applicable to that source, then discharges have to 3 comply with those effluent limitations. 4 It's important to realize here that the 5 Clean Water Act, contrary to the way the Petitioners try 6 to present it, is not just one big permitting statute. 7 It's not simply 402 and 404 and that determines 8 everything. The effluent limitations under sections 301 9 and 306 have independent applicability directly to 10 discharges. They are separately enforceable by EPA and 11 through citizens. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The discharges we 13 are talking about have to be discharges of effluent, 14 right? 15 MR. WALDO: Something that is governed by an 16 effluent limitation, yes. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My question is, does 18 it apply to solids? 19 MR. WALDO: Absolutely. EPA is required in 20 the Clean Water Act to regulate suspended solids through 21 effluent limitations. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess, I 23 mean, does suspended solids mean there is some liquid 24 involved? 25 MR. WALDO: That implies some liquid, right;
31

1 that -- that the solids are present in the liquid, like 2 the discharge here. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Like the discharge 4 here. Now, I think Mr. Olson said these are 55 percent 5 solid by volume. 6 MR. WALDO: By weight. By volume it is 30 7 percent solids. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a point at 9 which it's proper to speak of it as a solid rather than 10 a suspended solid? I mean, 90 percent by weight or by 11 volume, whichever it is, solid? 12 MR. WALDO: Well, the standard in this case 13 prohibits a discharge of processed wastewater. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 15 MR. WALDO: And so, it -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You wouldn't think 17 something that's 90 percent solid is wastewater? 18 MR. WALDO: There might be some point at 19 which the liquid content of a solid waste is so small 20 that EPA wouldn't regard it as processed wastewater 21 anymore. But that's not the case here. In this case, 22 there is no dispute that the discharge is processed 23 wastewater. The government has conceded that point. 24 And -- and it's extremely important, because 25 EPA is required to, as I said, regulate suspended solids

1 through effluent limitations and to adopt a zero -2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if they were just 3 putting whatever it is that doesn't have any water, 4 concrete, into this lake, then you agree that it would 5 be just the Corps of Engineers through the fill -- fill 6 provisions that would govern that? 7 MR. WALDO: As long as there is no effluent 8 limitation governing it, yes. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so, if they chop 10 up the concrete and put a little water in so that it's 11 easier to move, then all of a sudden it comes under 402 12 and the EPA's jurisdiction? 13 MR. WALDO: It depends on if EPA has adopted 14 an effluent limitation for it. So if that waste stream 15 that you are describing comes from some kind of factory, 16 concrete -- for example, cement manufacturing is a 17 source category that EPA -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I'm just 19 curious how that makes any sense, since we are talking 20 about putting something into water. I mean, does it 21 really matter whether you add the water before it goes 22 into the lake or just the lake adds the water when you 23 put in the solid? 24 MR. WALDO: EPA -25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERT: Either way, I guess

1 your friends on the other side would argue, I assume, 2 that it's properly regarded as fill material, because 3 that is the effect of it, rather than as effluent 4 subject to 402. 5 MR. WALDO: EPA has always regulated 6 industrial sources that -- whose raw processed 7 wastewater contains high levels of suspended solids, 8 high enough that it would have the effect of fill 9 material and can be considered fill. In fact -- and, in 10 fact, EPA has always had a definition of fill material 11 that was based on the effects. 12 So for more than 30 years, EPA has been 13 regulating sources like ore processing mills, cement 14 manufacturing plants, aluminum smelters, coal-fired 15 power plants, all of which and many more require the use 16 of settling ponds to remove the solids. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So do we decide -- we 18 decide this case on the assumption that this is fill? 19 Do you agree that this is fill? 20 MR. WALDO: It's both. It's fill material 21 and it's processed wastewater that is subject to an 22 effluent limitation. 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then the question 24 that we've put earlier is whether or not a single pipe 25 contained both, and you say that it can contain both.

WALDO: No. In this case there can't be 16 any permit because there is a new source performance 17 standard that prohibits -18 JUSTICE ALITO: All right. So, let's change 19 that. What if the -- what if the new source performance 20 standard was not a total prohibition? What if there was 21 an effluent limitation in there, so that a permit could 22 be issued, provided that there was compliance with the 23 effluent limitation? Now, who issues the permit?

1 MR. WALDO: If there is an effluent 2 limitation applicable, it will end up having to be EPA 3 that issues the permit, and that's -- that's simply 4 because the Corps of Engineers just doesn't have the 5 tools available to apply effluent limitations in its 404 6 permits, except for toxic substances. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: Where do you find that in 8 the statute? 9 MR. WALDO: Well -10 JUSTICE ALITO: Where there's a situation 11 where possibly there could be a 402 and a 404 permit, 12 the 402 permit trumps the 404 permit? 13 MR.

And I'm asking where in the statute does it 25 say that?

1 MR. WALDO: It is an absence of a provision 2 in 404, but -- but the thing is, even if 404 has -- even 3 if the Corps of Engineers -- and I should say, we agree 4 with the Government and with the agencies about this. 5 The agencies have never interpreted section 404 to 6 provide for the application of effluent limitations in 7 404 permits. The 404(b) guidelines don't provide for 8 it; it's not provided in the statute. And so, they just 9 don't have the ability to do it. 10 The problem is, they try to carry that a 11 step farther and take that absence of provision to say 12 that it's an exception from effluent limitations, to say 13 that they don't have to comply with section 301 and 306, 14 but it doesn't say that; and that's an implied 15 exception, and the Court should only find an implied 16 exception if it's necessary to avoid absurd results. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Could you go -18 MR. WALDO: No one -19 JUSTICE BREYER: Excuse me. Could you go 20 back for a second to my discussion with Mr. Olson? I'm 21 thinking of it in very simplified terms. The simplified 22 terms is, I think of a pipe and I think of a 23 circumstance where some terrible pollutant comes out of 24 the pipe that would be subject to 306; and if the pipe 25 goes up in a river or a lake, a regular lake, it could

1 fill up the bottom. Seems possible. 2 MR. WALDO: Yes. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So if it fills 4 up the bottom, it's called fill and comes under 404. 5 MR. WALDO: It doesn't even have to fill it 6 up very much -7 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I know, I know that. 8 I see the point. But I mean, it seems to me if it fills 9 up to the bottom to whatever point, it's fill, and now 10 it's the Army Corps of Engineers. If it has effluent in 11 it, it's effluent and so now it's under EPA. In other 12 words, you have both. 13 MR. WALDO: That's the situation. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: It's only been going on for 15 40 years. I'm sure this isn't the first time they've 16 had both. 17 MR. WALDO: That's exactly right. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and so I don't 19 understand. What I would think of is if you have two 20 sets of standards and it's both, they should satisfy 21 both. I'm not writing these statutes. 22 MR. WALDO: Well, let me -- I think -23 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I heard from -- and I 24 might interpret Mr. Olson -- he may not have really said 25 this, but the way I heard it was: Well, don't worry,

1 because if it's fill and you get it over to the Corps of 2 Engineers, they are going to apply the effluent standard 3 anyway. And now you are sort of saying: Well, or they 4 are going to apply some standard. And then there was a 5 question of well, what standard, and we got a little 6 vague there. 7 Now, what happens if it goes to the EPA as 8 effluent? Justice Alito's question is, well, do they 9 apply the fill standard? And between my response to 10 these two answers, I still don't understand how it 11 works. It's -- help me. 12 MR. WALDO: The Corps of Engineers only 13 applies toxic effluent limitations. There are other 14 pollutants that are nontoxic -15 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So now, if you lose 16 this case, what we are going to have is all the fish are 17 going to be killed by some horrible pollutant, and the 18 -- the Army Corps of Engineers can't do anything about 19 it, and the only reason is we put enough of the 20 pollutant in there to fill it up to ten feet from the 21 bottom. And then if you did it the other way, if the 22 EPA regulated it, it might do something terrible under 23 404, and they couldn't do anything about it. 24 Now it's very hard for me to believe that 25 that's really how these agencies have been operating for
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 40 years. 2 MR. WALDO: Well, that's not; and let me 3 explain how they have been operating, because I think 4 that will help clarify it. For 40 years EPA has 5 regulated sources like ore processing mills, aluminum 6 smelters, others that I have named, others that are 7 listed in our brief, and has applied effluent 8 limitations to those discharges. Now, you hear -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even when they -10 even fill -- even when they fill a lake? 11 MR. WALDO: Yes, absolutely -- and let me 12 explain that, because you hear this statement a lot: 13 "EPA never regulates fill material." Well, that's 14 because when you apply the effluent limitations, it's 15 not fill material anymore. 16 The effluent limitations require the use of 17 settling ponds that are not in navigable waters. The 18 settling ponds or other technologies remove almost all 19 of the solids so that the discharge that is permitted by 20 EPA in the section 402 permit might have a limitation of 21 20 or 30 milligrams per liter, something that wouldn't 22 have a measurable filling effect on the receiving water 23 body. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when EPA 25 regulates has regulated these for 40 years, which I
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 assume is up until 2002, then it's -- it's because they 2 don't go into lakes; it's because they go into settling 3 ponds? 4 MR. WALDO: Settling ponds. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which are not 6 navigable waters of the United States. 7 MR. WALDO: Exactly. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the new 9 regulation says the EPA does not regulate it when it 10 goes into -- I can understand why the Army Corps of 11 Engineers doesn't care if it's an impoundment pond or a 12 settling pond, but they do care when it's a lake. 13 MR. WALDO: When they adopted the new 14 regulation, they were very clear that they intended to 15 continue their past practice. The agencies never stated 16 an intent to repeal or modify or change the 17 applicability of any effluent limitations, and in fact 18 this question came up repeatedly: What happens if it's 19 fill material but it's subject to an effluent 20 limitation; and every time they addressed it, they said 21 the same thing. Effluent limitations will continue to 22 apply and will be applied through section 402 permits. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To fill material as 24 defined in the 2002 regulation? 25 MR. WALDO: That's what it's all about, yes.

WALDO: No, it's been permitted -25 prohibited.

I mean, the 6 EPA says not. Do you have a -- an instance where it was 7 prohibited where a company wanted to -- to emit fill 8 material into a lake and the EPA said no, you can't do 9 it, because of the effluent limitations? 10 MR. WALDO: Well, if any -- I don't know if 11 anyone ever asked to do that, but if they did the answer 12 would have been no. I can't come up with an answer 13 because that's what the effluent limitations require. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: But your -- your 40 years 15 of experience then really don't -- don't cover this 16 case. People have been putting it into settling ponds. 17 Let me ask you another question. The other 18 side says that the alternative to this would be even 19 worse, or it sounds worse to me, anyway. What -- what 20 is your solution, closing down the mine? Is there -21 MR. WALDO: No, no, no. We -- we agree with 22 EPA on this point. There is a different of opinion 23 between EPA and Corps of Engineers as to which was the 24 preferred site. EPA preferred the dry land disposal 25 site, and -- and we agree that has much less adverse
44

1 affect on the ecosystem. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- your description of 3 that effect? The other solution we were told would 4 involve filling in a vast expanse of wetlands and then 5 having these huge piles that could be seen by all the 6 tourist boats. 7 MR. WALDO: Yes, it has -- it does have 8 adverse impacts, that is, some; but in EPA's view and in 9 our view is not as bad as filling up a lake and killing 10 all the fish and aquatic life in the lake. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All the fish, there 12 are a thousand fish in this lake, right? 13 MR. WALDO: Yes. Right. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And those aren't 15 endangered fish; there are millions of them somewhere 16 else, right? 17 MR. WALDO: That's right. But it's -- it's 18 also an important point for us here that this is a 19 national rule, and EPA considered these kind of 20 alternative land use requirements as an effect of its 21 no-discharge rule. When the -- EPA specifically 22 addressed the fact that if you prohibit discharges of 23 processed wastewater into navigable waters, it's going 24 to require using more land to dispose of all that solid 25 waste somewhere, and they determined that the benefits

WALDO: When -- when the Corps of 7 Engineers proposed the draft 404 permit, EPA commented 8 on it and said, we disagree with your conclusion that 9 filling up the lake is the least environmentally 10 dangerous. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if it really felt 12 that way, couldn't it simply have vetoed the permit? 13 MR. WALDO: Yes, EPA can veto -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it couldn't have felt 15 very strongly about it. 16 MR. WALDO: Well, EPA -- the veto authority 17 is a discretionary authority. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 19 MR. WALDO: It's for unacceptable adverse 20 consequences. And for understandable reasons, EPA very 21 rarely exercises that authority. But EPA never changed 22 its position about whether the -- about which was the 23 preferred alternative. The EPA -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: It couldn't have preferred 25 it very much, or it would have vetoed this one.

1 MR. WALDO: It -- apparently not enough to 2 come to the conclusion that it was one of those 3 situations where they wanted to veto based on 4 unacceptable adverse consequences. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any aquatic 6 life in this lake other than a thousand fish? 7 MR. WALDO: Well, sure. There's 8 microinvertebrae and -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Microinvertebrae? 10 MR. WALDO: I mean, all sorts of the things 11 that fish feed on. Plant life and animal life, and all 12 that stuff. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Plankton and stuff. 14 MR. WALDO: Yes. Whatever. I'm not an 15 expert on the ecology of this lake, but there is a 16 couple of different kinds of fish and other life that 17 make it possible for those fish to live there, and 18 essentially -19 JUSTICE BREYER: Is it right -20 MR. WALDO: -- it would all be destroyed. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: Is it right -- now, I am 22 back on my hobby horse -- but is it right that this 23 slurry is pushing into this lake 50 feet or 75 feet 24 covering the bottom with some stuff? A lot of it's 25 dirt, and some of it's the worst chemical ever, except

1 it's not toxic? Okay. I guess cyanide isn't toxic. 2 But the -- the -- now I just heard that if 3 the EPA doesn't give the permit, but the Corps of 4 Engineers does, the EPA has the power to veto the 5 permit. Is that right? 6 MR. WALDO: EPA can veto for unacceptable 7 adverse consequences. It's not a way to enforce 8 effluent limitations. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? If they have a 10 veto power -11 MR. WALDO: Because that's all 404(c) says. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: I know it comes under a 13 different statute, but in any instance where in fact 14 they see that some of their rules that they promulgate 15 are being violated and they think the Corps of Engineers 16 is not paying attention to those rules, they can veto 17 it. 18 MR. WALDO: Well, but then -19 JUSTICE BREYER: If they don't veto it, then 20 that would be a way of reconciling these two things. 21 MR. WALDO: The -- the position that EPA has 22 taken in this case, unfortunately, is that, if the 23 discharge meets that definition of fill material, no 24 matter how bad the consequences are for water quality, 25 it's fill material, and it's therefore exempt from
49

1 effluent limitations -2 JUSTICE BREYER: So couldn't they veto it? 3 MR. WALDO: Only if it was for adverse -4 well, if they found adverse -- unacceptable adverse 5 consequences -6 JUSTICE BREYER: And wouldn't an 7 unacceptable adverse consequence be that it puts all 8 this effluent into the water? 9 MR. WALDO: It's a different standard from 10 whether it violates an effluent limitation. That's all 11 I'm saying. 12 And I want to be clear that the effluent in 13 this case, although it doesn't necessarily violate any 14 toxic pollutant effluent, it is toxic. It's toxic with 15 conventional pollutants. It has a pH of 10, which is 16 toxic to aquatic life. It's very high. It's about the 17 pH of ammonia, is what this slurry effluent is that's 18 being discharged in this case. And the -19 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that the pH at the 20 point where it's discharged, and not the general pH in 21 the lake? 22 MR. WALDO: It will dilute in the lake. 23 They are using the lake as their diluting settling pond. 24 That's right. They're using a navigable water body -25 JUSTICE ALITO: What's the answer to the
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 question, when -- once it's released into the lake, 2 what's the pH of the lake as opposed to the -3 MR. WALDO: Oh, it will dilute in the lake, 4 so it will revert to normal levels, but -5 JUSTICE ALITO: Within how long? 6 MR. WALDO: Oh, I mean, that happens, you 7 know, in a -- some sort of a mixing zone just outside 8 the pipe. That happens pretty quickly. 9 Now, for the lake to recover -10 JUSTICE ALITO: The pH that you just cited 11 was the pH -12 MR. WALDO: Of the slurry. 13 JUSTICE ALITO: -- just at the point of the 14 discharge? 15 MR. WALDO: Of the slurry. That's right. 16 And -- now I want to talk about this allegation that 17 it's like dumping wet sand in the lake. That's not true 18 at all. They tested the tailings sediment from this 19 discharge with two organisms, and with one of them, it 20 killed 95 percent of the organisms in the test, which is 21 way over the top for EPA's toxicity threshold. In the 22 other organism they had, it -- the organism survived, 23 but their reproduction rate was significantly reduced, 24 also meeting the toxicity test standards that EPA 25 establishes. So this --

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to follow up, 2 that's the same point, though, that Justice Alito made: 3 You're testing that right as it comes out, not as it's 4 diluted in the lake. 5 MR. WALDO: No. No, Your Honor, that's not 6 right. That's what the solids -- that's the affect of 7 the solids, and that's why, as a result of that, they 8 established this rule that -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, I didn't 10 understand you. I thought you said that the toxicity in 11 the slurry was tested and killed 99 or whatever percent 12 of these invertebrates. 13 MR. WALDO: They took that slurry, they let 14 the solids settle down in the bottom, and then they 15 tested the solids for what effect it would have on some 16 fresh water organisms, because they were trying to 17 determine whether the lake would be able to recover from 18 depositing all these solids into the lake. And they 19 found that it had a very high toxicity level. And so 20 what they did to try to remedy that was require 21 depositing native vegetation on the top of all of that, 22 after the mine closes. And they are hoping that that 23 will have the effect of letting the lake recover. But 24 EPA concluded that it will take decades, if ever, before 25 the lake can recover from that.

1 So this is not some benign wet-sand kind of 2 discharge. It's a toxic slurry with a high pH level and 3 with effects that are going to last for decades. And if 4 EPA -- if section 404 is interpreted to allow these 5 kinds of discharges to be emitted exempt from effluent 6 limitations, it eviscerates key requirements of the 7 Clean Water Act. EPA is required to regulate sources of 8 this type through effluent limitations. EPA is required 9 to regulate the suspended solids through effluent 10 limitations from industrial sources like this. So -11 JUSTICE BREYER: If, in fact, you have this 12 mix, and it satisfies -- it goes to an effluent part and 13 a fill part, in your view, what -- if the statute says 14 both agencies regulate, they have to meet both, one or 15 the other? How does it work? 16 MR. WALDO: If there's an effluent 17 limitation, the effluent -- there's a performance 18 standard under section 306. The performance standard 19 must be complied with under section 306(e). And the 20 only way -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You say this is 404; it's 22 not 402 -23 MR. WALDO: No. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It is 306? 25 MR. WALDO: 404 is not appropriate here

1 because there is an effluent limitation. With fill 2 material -3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it is fill. 4 MR. WALDO: It's fill material, but it's not 5 fill material that is available for a section 404 6 permit. And EPA has always regulated discharges from 7 sources like this, that meet that definition of fill 8 material. EPA has had an effects-based definition of 9 fill material since virtually the beginning of the Clean 10 Water Act. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: So fill material is only 12 that material as to which no effluent standard applies? 13 MR. WALDO: No, it's fill material. In this 14 case, it's fill material, but this fill material is not 15 eligible for a 404 permit. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: 404 material is material 17 such that it is fill material and there is no effluent 18 standard applicable? 19 MR. WALDO: Yes, that's correct. And -20 JUSTICE ALITO: So, it's 95 percent solid, 21 but there's an effluent limitation, and your position is 22 that there can't be a 404 permit; it has to be a 402 23 permit? 24 MR. WALDO: If it's covered -- if that 25 discharge is covered by an effluent limitation, yes,

1 that's correct. And I want to be clear about this 2 point, that EPA -- well, I guess my time is up. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. Finish 4 your thought. 5 MR. WALDO: Okay. EPA amended its 6 regulations in 1979 specifically to recognize the fact 7 that some discharges of fill material are not eligible 8 for section 404 permits and require NPDES permits. At 9 that time, the regulations said you don't need an NPDES 10 permit if it's fill material. EPA amended that 11 regulation to say you don't need an NPDES permit if it's 12 fill material and it's subject to section 404 of the 13 Clean Water Act. And the purpose of that -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 15 Waldo. 16 MR. WALDO: Thank you. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Olson, you have 18 three minutes remaining. 19 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON 20 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 21 MR. OLSON: What the Respondents would wish 22 to do is to have this Court disagree with the agencies' 23 interpretation of the statutes which they administer, 24 their consistent interpretations of those statutes, and 25 the factual findings that a whole slew of agencies made
55

1 with respect to the subject matter of these permits. 2 The preamble of the 202 -- the 2002 fill 3 regulations specifically says -- this is 31,135 of 4 Federal Register Volume 67 -- EPA has never sought to 5 regulate fill material under effluent guidelines. 6 Never. 7 There was an agreement, a memorandum of 8 agreement between EPA and the Corps of Engineers in 9 1986. It is cited at the United States Government brief 10 at page 27. The EPA and the Corps agree -- and this is 11 in response to your question, Justice Breyer, and I 12 think something Justice Kennedy said and something 13 Justice Souter said with respect to what if there are 14 two things in the stream going into the water. Fill 15 material remains subject to 404 permitting even if they 16 occur in association with discharges meeting 402 17 criteria. That's the answer to that question. And the 18 -- and the EPA -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought -- I thought 20 your brother would say: But that does not respond to 21 306 effluent. 22 MR. OLSON: 306 provisions in the statute 23 are not made applicable to 404 permitting, and the 24 consistent regulatory history from 1973 -- and it's all 25 set out on page 27, or summarized on page 27 of the

1 government's brief -- are that 301 and 306 are not 2 applicable under the 404 process. 3 And if there was any doubt at all, there is 4 a -- the so-called mine tailings memorandum at pages 141 5 through 145 of the joint appendix in which three top 6 officials of the EPA construe what they call the rules, 7 the regulations, and the statute. This is both 8 agencies. Under the plain regulation language of the 9 rule -- this is page 145a -- under the plain language of 10 the rule and the agency's interpretation of the 11 regulation in its preamble, the mine tailings that are 12 to be placed into an impoundment are covered by 404. 13 And it specifically addresses this -14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why does that mean anything 15 more than you've got to get a 404 permit without 16 addressing the question whether you can get a 404 permit 17 if it has, in effect, the -- the -- if it has the 18 effects which are supposed to be regulated by the 19 effluent limitations? 20 MR. OLSON: That precise question, 21 Justice Souter, is addressed on pages 143, 144, and 145 22 of this memorandum from top officials of the EPA, 23 applicable to this particular mine and these particular 24 discharges -25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Where is -- where is that

1 in the appendix? 2 MR. OLSON: That's on pages 141 through 145a 3 of the joint appendix. 4 JUSTICE STEVENS: But as I read that 5 sentence, Mr. Olson, it says they are subject to both 6 permitting. 7 MR. OLSON: No, it doesn't. It says -- with 8 due respect, Justice Stevens, it says on the bottom of 9 page 144: "As a result, the regulatory regime 10 applicable to the discharges under section 402," and so 11 forth. What -- I think one thing that -12 JUSTICE STEVENS: You are talking about the 13 last sentence on -14 MR. OLSON: There is a 402 permit in this 15 case, too there is a 404 permit with respect to material 16 going into the lake and a 402 permit for the material 17 coming out of the lake into the waters of the United 18 States. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 20 Olson.
