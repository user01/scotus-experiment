3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Case No. 14916, Kingdomware

5 Technologies v. United States.

6             Mr. Saunders.

7            ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. SAUNDERS

8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9             MR. SAUNDERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11             By its plain terms, the 2006 Veterans Act

12 requires the VA to consider veterans first under the

13 Rule of Two before awarding contracts to other

14 suppliers.

15             That mandate, which applies only to the VA

16 and reflects the agency's unique obligation to veterans,

17 contains no exception for the contracts formed when the

18 VA makes awards under the Federal Supply Schedule.  And

19 the government's attempt to create such an exception

20 fares no better than its prior attempts to resist the

21 mandate.

22             Its semantic distinction between contracts

23 and orders conflicts with its own concession that an FSS

24 order is a contract in the ordinary sense.  It

25 creates 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE ALITO:  Before you get too deeply

4

2 into the merits of the case, could you just tell us what

3 relief you could get at this point that's consistent

4 with the Tucker Act?

5             MR. SAUNDERS:  We're seeking a declaratory

6 judgment that, with respect to these particular

7 procurements, the VA erred in failing to conduct market

8 research and  and to apply the Rule of Two before

9 going straight to the FSS.

10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  On the ground that this

11 is capable of repetition yet evasive of review, is that

12 your  your answer to the mootness?

13             MR. SAUNDERS:  Absolutely.  It's  it's

14 recurred  the same situation's recurred numerous

15 times.  Even during the course of this litigation,

16 Kingdomware continues to be actively competing for these

17 contracts, and these contracts are of a short duration.

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What was the amount of

19 this contract?

20             MR. SAUNDERS:  This contract was for a base

21 amount of $33,000.

22             JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't it strange to get a

23 declaratory judgment that something unlawful occurred in

24 the past but that no other relief is available for this

25 past violation of the law?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. SAUNDERS:  Well, no other relief is

5

2 available solely because of the passage of time it has

3 taken for this case to work its way up to this Court.

4 And that's why the doctrine of capable of repetition yet

5 evading a view  review is 

6             JUSTICE ALITO:  What  what I'm getting at

7 is:  What good would such a declaratory judgment do?

8             MR. SAUNDERS:  Well, once  once the legal

9 rights, once the meaning of 8127(d) is established in

10 this case by that declaratory judgment, then going

11 forward, you would expect that the VA will comply with

12 this Court's interpretation of the law.  And so it would

13 be a tremendous benefit to the veterans community going

14 forward from that declaration, from that elucidation of

15 the legal rights here.

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You did  your client

17 stipulated away the cost that it would have been

18 entitled to after winning before the GAO, correct?

19             MR. SAUNDERS:  The 

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So there was relief.

21 You just gave it away, essentially.

22             MR. SAUNDERS:  Well, the  the Tucker Act

23 doesn't allow for the protest costs, and so the  the

24 relevant costs that might have been allowed would be bid

25 preparation costs.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             But the very point of this case is there

6

2 wasn't an opportunity to bid.  This isn't a situation in

3 which the opportunity was put out there and Kingdomware

4 was able to compete for it.  It was  it skipped

5 through the Rule of Two process required by 8127, went

6 straight to the Federal Supply Schedule, and the first

7 that Kingdomware ever learned of it was when the

8 announcement went up saying that the contract had been

9 awarded on the solesource basis to someone else under

10 the Federal Supply Schedule.

11             So under the circumstances of this case,

12 where it's about the government going to a procedure it

13 shouldn't be going to first, there's no opportunity to

14 amass those bid protests.

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Your client is still an

16 FSS vendor and is still competing for contact 

17 contracts that the 

18             MR. SAUNDERS:  Yes.

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay.

20             MR. SAUNDERS:  And  and our client  he's

21 listed it in the FSS, but most importantly for this case

22 is a servicedisabled veteranowned small business and

23 continues to be listed in the VA's database, which

24 limits the eligibility for the Rule of Two here.

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The government takes the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
7 1 position that if we rule in your favor, that means that 2 we're doing away with, effectively, the FSS. 3             Is that your view? 4             MR. SAUNDERS:  No.  Absolutely not.  The FSS 5 is still going to apply to a large number of 6 procurements.  Congress, when it made this targeted 7 provision mandatory and focused on the VA, also said in 8 8127(e) that it only applies to the businesses that are 9 registered in the VA's database. 10             And it did that for two reasons:  Number 11 one, as opposed to the selfcertification procedures of 12 the Small Business Act, which are more open to abuse, it 13 wanted to prescreen and make sure these are the real 14 deal here in the database.  And that also ensures that 15 the VA has this information at its fingertips. 16             Currently, there are about 7,000 people 17 listed in that database.  There are going to be tons of 18 procurements for which the VA will simply consult its 19 own database and see that there is no veteranowned 20 business that's eligible to do this. 21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can it tell from that 22 database whether or not a particular vendor is a veteran 23 or a disabled veteran? 24             MR. SAUNDERS:  Oh, absolutely.  The  the 25 database  and this is one  this is very clear  the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
8 1 VA has its own VAspecific database mandated by law that 2 is limited to veteranowned and servicedisabled, 3 veteranowned small businesses.  And the only people who 4 are eligible under 8127(e) for this preference are 5 people who are contained in that database. 6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, there's two 7 databases.  There is the general database and there is 8 the FSS database.  Are we talking about the same one? 9             MR. SAUNDERS:  No, we're talk  we're 10 talking about a separate VAspecific database.  And  11 and so what's happening is the VA is gathering in this 12 information.  It knows who the veteranowned small 13 businesses are.  And then, rather than consulting its 14 own database to see who they are, it's been going 15 straight to the FSS. 16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Which  and then you 17 are wanting to do away with the FSS? 18             MR. SAUNDERS:  No, not at all.  Because  19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So they go through the 20 FSS and find the veteranowned businesses? 21             MR. SAUNDERS:  Not  not under this 22 mandate, because the  the mandate here in the law is 23 tied to the VA's database.  And people who are listed as 24 a veteranowned small business under the FSS database 25 don't go through those same 
Alderson Reporting Company

1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Saunders, I think

9

2 that Justice Sotomayor's question is asking you to

3 address what happens if there's than urgent need.  I

4 think you would concede it's a slower process if you

5 have to use the Rule of Two.  And  and suppose there

6 is an urgent need for a certain good or service.

7             MR. SAUNDERS:  Well, two things:  Number

8 one, the Rule of Two only applies when you have both

9 fair and reasonable price and best value to the

10 United States.  So if there's truly an urgent need and

11 it's not going to be met by going through the Rule of

12 Two, then I think you have leeway within the bestvalue

13 determination.

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that

15 strikes me as a  a very thin protection.

16             Are  these terms imply a lot of

17 discretion:  What's fair?  What's reasonable?  What's

18 best value?  The idea that that's going to operate as a

19 significant restraint on the requirement that the VA

20 locate veteran businesses seems a real stretch to me.

21             MR. SAUNDERS:  But  but the process

22 here  I mean  take you through the process of

23 applying the Rule of Two.  It's limited to the universe

24 of the people in the database.  So all the VA has to do

25 is fire up its own database and see who's out there.

10

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  How is it apparent that a

3 particular veteran's business can perform a particular

4 contract?  I mean, what in the database shows you, yes,

5 this veteran's small business is capable of performing

6 this contract in a reasonably effective way?

7             MR. SAUNDERS:  The  because the database

8 has the North American Industry Classification System

9 codes, which are actually the same codes that correspond

10 to what's in the FSS.

11             And to the extent there is additional

12 information that's needed, it's very easy to contact the

13 veterans in those  that database.

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, could you

15 get back to your answer to my question?

16             MR. SAUNDERS:  Oh.  And  and so there's 

17 for the heartland of  of smallbusiness contracting,

18 the  are going to fall into the simplified acquisition

19 procedures under part 13 of the Federal Acquisition

20 Regulation.  That's for services under $150,000.  And

21 for procurement of goods, it's now up to $7 million.

22             And under that system, you have a greatly

23 streamlined process for the smallest contracts, micro

24 purchases.  It's  it's really just you make the

25 decision for the sort of lower tier of contracts,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1 certainly for anything under $25,000, all the  all the 2 government's doing is placing a purchase order under the 3 simplified acquisition procedures. 4             There is a standard form.  It's Form 1449. 5 It's a single sheet of paper.  And that's the purchase 6 order that they place.  And quite frankly, the form 7 looks almost identical to FSS Form 347 for how you place 8 the order. 9             So for the lowerlevel stuff, there is 10 already a procedure outside the FSS that's incredibly 11 streamlined.  And as you begin to get to larger 12 dollarvalued contracts, the requirements of going 13 within the FSS begin to ramp up in terms of having to 14 seek price reductions.  And also, if you think of how 15 the FSS operates in terms of services, you might be 16 listed on there for the GSA as someone who can provide 17 information technology, customized computer programming. 18             But to go to Justice Kagan's question about 19 how do you know can you actually do this work?  That 20 same process plays out under the FSS.  For the services, 21 yes, someone's listed as a custom computer programmer. 22 But the agency still has to issue a statement of work 23 saying this is what we actually need done.  Here are our 24 requirements.  It puts that out there with their request 25 for quotations that come in from the various FSS

2             Now, they will be constrained by, you know,

3 the prices that they listed before on the FSS, but it

4 still is an interactive process.  It's not just firing

5 up the computer and  and clicking 

6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When is it  what's

7 it 

8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I suppose there is

9 some system for the government to check to see whether

10 or not this person really has been offering this good,

11 has  has a track record, because that goes with the

12 fair and reasonable price?

13             MR. SAUNDERS:  Yes, absolutely.  And they

14 can compare, you know, a broad  when they're doing the

15 market research, they have a lot of flexibility to

16 compare here.

17             The other thing I will say is that there is

18 a broad grant of discretion to the VA in terms of what

19 it requires in the database.  So if it finds that it

20 needs more information to make this law work up front

21 from the vendors, then it can require that.  It can take

22 the effort that it spent resisting the mandate and put

23 it into making the mandate work within its existing 

24             JUSTICE BREYER:  Is this the case 

25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You mentioned the best

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
13 1 value to the United States is one of the qualifications. 2             I understand fair and reasonable price.  But 3 what is offer best value to the United States?  What 4 does that add to the fair and reasonable price? 5             MR. SAUNDERS:  Well, best value is designed 6 to go beyond price.  It's  it's really sort of the 7 totality of the circumstances.  It lets the government 8 consider quality, its  its needs.  In this case it 9 would allow it to consider the urgency of a particular 10 procurement. 11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the sort of 12 thing that there will be an awful lot of litigation 13 about, don't you think? 14             MR. SAUNDERS:  Against a framework that has 15 been recognized, the discretion  you know, there's 16 litigation within an APA framework in terms of arbitrary 17 and capricious review. 18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you're putting 19 a lot more weight on that  excuse me  on that 20 provision if you prevail on your statutory 21 interpretation argument.  And it seems to me that that 22 provision is inevitably going to lead to litigation. 23 How do you tell what's best?  It's a combination of 24 price and quality.  It's not any absolute that you can 25 identify, and you know, what's fair, what's reasonable.

3 to say  almost in every case.

4             MR. SAUNDERS:  I  given the  the

5 standards for making that out, I don't think that you

6 would see rampant litigation in this area in terms of

7 the  the squishiness of the time cuts in favor of the

8 government in that sense there.

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How do  how do we know

10 how to evaluate your answer or the government's position

11 if the government comes and says, oh, this is just

12 unworkable, it's going to be difficult if we've never

13 been involved in government contracting?  Are there

14 findings?  Are there  are there writings in law

15 reviews or what  what do we look to, to determine the

16 empirical basis for your argument, or the lack of

17 empirical basis for your argument?

20 going to happen?

21             MR. SAUNDERS:  Well, no.  It's looking to

22 the  the authorities that exist on the face of the

23 statute, in terms of look at the simplified acquisition

24 procedures and how streamlined they can be, look at the

25 FSS procedures and how complicated and  and  they

1 can be as the dollar values ramp up.

15

2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there is no empirical

3 evidence because this is  this is a new kind of

4 provision, this mandatory setaside; isn't that true?

5 So we don't have any  any logic.  We don't have any

6 experience at all.

7             MR. SAUNDERS:  We  we don't have direct

8 experience with the mandatory provision like this

9 because it's been resisted for a decade and hasn't

10 gone 

11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Hasn't the SBA been

12 using it?

13             MR. SAUNDERS:  Well, under the Small

14 Business Act, there were agencies that were doing

15 setasides, and then it was made explicit that they

16 could do setasides within the FSS.  We also have been

17 dealing with situations for many years where you have

18 other preferences outside of the Small Business Act

19 framework in terms of Federal Prison Industries, the

20 AbilityOne Program for the blind and the severely

21 disabled that have always taken precedence over the FSS.

22 And it's not proved to be unworkable to give those

23 mandates mandatory effect without going to the FSS.

24             And you know, we've also cited  you see in

25 our reply briefs  sources saying  and we have a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
16 1 treatise that we've cited  that's discussed the fact 2 that the simplified acquisition procedures for these low 3 value contracts are just as simple, if not in many ways, 4 simpler. 5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you're not talking 6 about just the small value contracts.  You want the 7 supply to all contracts, to all orders.  So to tell me 8 that it works for the small ones is not answering the 9 questions of my colleagues.  How much is it going to 10 complicate the big ones? 11             MR. SAUNDERS:  Well, for the  for the big 12 ones, the FSS itself is already complicated.  It's 13 already ramping up in complexity as the contracts get 14 bigger. 15             And quite frankly, when we get to those 16 bigger dollar figures, the idea that if  if a small 17 business is going to qualify for a contract that's above 18 $150,000, that we can't go through the procedures that 19 Congress mandated here, the VA can't even consult its 20 own database and see whether there's an eligible 21 supplier before going straight to the FSS I don't think 22 holds water in that sense. 23             And at the end of the day here, we're 24 looking at a mandate that was plain on its face in terms 25 of Congress saying shall award contracts, contracts
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
17 1 being an expansive, allinclusive term here.  And these 2 policy judgments are judgments that Congress made in 3 terms of the administrative feasibility of this when it 4 decided to move away from the failed Small Business Act 5 approach and go to the mandatory approach here. 6             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's why I wondered  7 I'm not certain how this works  that I read the 8 statute.  It says, "The department shall award contracts 9 on the basis of competition restricted to veterans.  If, 10 if, if.  Okay?  Well, what wouldn't be awarded according 11 to veterans?  I mean, what was surprising to me is that 12 the goal was to have 3 percent awarded to veterans. 13             But if I read this the way you read it, 14 everything will be awarded to veterans.  I mean, maybe 15 not literally, but there are millions of veterans. 16 There are probably hundreds of thousands or millions of 17 veterans' businesses.  So wouldn't everything be awarded 18 to veterans?  What wouldn't be? 19             MR. SAUNDERS:  No, not  not at all. 20             JUSTICE BREYER:  What wouldn't?  That's what 21 I want you to address. 22             MR. SAUNDERS:  The vast  for the  given 23 the limited number of veteranowned small businesses 24 that are out there, and  25             JUSTICE BREYER:  How many are there?
Alderson Reporting Company

1             MR. SAUNDERS:  When  when Congress was

18

2 going through the legislative history here, it was

3 hearing that maybe 15 percent of businesses.  So

4 there 

5             JUSTICE BREYER:  It may be 15 percent of

6 businesses, but the question is what does the Department

7 of Veterans Affairs buy?  And my guess is they buy lots

8 of stuff.  They buy household stuff, they buy paper

9 towels, they buy buildings, they buy all kinds of

10 things.  And in respect to all the things they buy, if

11 you read this, a contract supplies to everything.  I

12 guess they'll buy it all from veterans.  Now, it's

13 just  or 90 percent, I don't know.  It's very

14 surprising to me that Congress would have wanted the

15 Veterans Administration to buy everything from veterans.

16 Now  now, that's  or nearly everything.

17             Now you explain to me  I must be missing

18 something  and  and you explain to me what I'm

19 missing.

20             MR. SAUNDERS:  First, the  the fair and

21 reasonable price and best value requirement

2 surprising that Congress would have wanted nearly

3 everything to be bought from veterans, that's all.  And

4 where am I wrong?

5             MR. SAUNDERS:  You're wrong in terms of

6 the  the natural cap on the limit of businesses that

7 are out there, but where there is a veteranowned small

8 business that can perform the requirement 

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not saying they can't

10 perform.

11             MR. SAUNDERS:  No, no.  I'm saying 

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  I want you to address what

13 you're calling this natural cap.  You're saying to me

14 you're wrong, it doesn't mean everything, it means like

15 10 percent.  Is that what you're saying?  Or what 

16 what are you saying?

17             Explain what it is.  I read it.  I thought

18 it's everything.  Now you explain why it isn't

19 everything or nearly everything.  I mean, if you're not

20 a veteran, Congress wouldn't normally say you don't get

21 a leg up, but to shut you out entirely?  I mean,

22 that's  that's just my problem that I want you to

23 explain.

24             MR. SAUNDERS:  It's  it is everything, all

25 the contracts for which there is a veteranowned small

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  Are you saying Congress

3 want  just wanted everything that veterans can supply

4 to be supplied by veterans?  And if I say, is that

5 everything, it's not 90  it's not a hundred percent,

6 probably not 99 percent, but it might be 80 percent.  I

7 mean, I'm guessing.  You tell me.  You're the expert.

8 What percent is it when you win?

9             MR. SAUNDERS:  When I win I don't think

10 we're going to be talking about numbers that high.

11 Congress in the legislative history was talking about 15

12 percent of the 

13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I thought your answer

14 would be a hundred percent.

15             MR. SAUNDERS:  I'm just saying as a

16 practical matter.  In terms of what Congress 

17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the 

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is your answer to

19 Justice Breyer?  A hundred percent provided the

20 statutory requirements are satisfied?

21             MR. SAUNDERS:  Yes; that is correct.  When

22 there is a business 

23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And we know how many

24 businesses there are because they registered under a

25 special procedure.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
21 1             MR. SAUNDERS:  Right.  And so when there is 2 the business that's available, yes, it should be getting 3 all those opportunities.  That's exactly what 4 Congress  5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what Justice  what 6  Justice Breyer raised a question about the way this 7 statute is worded because it says, "For purposes of 8 meeting the goals."  And the goals are very low; the 9 goals are 3 percent. 10             So it seems odd for a statute to say for 11 persons of meeting a 3percent goal, you should do the 12 following, which will lead to 90 percent. 13             MR. SAUNDERS:  Well, a few points, Justice 14 Kagan.  First, the 3percent goal was the 15 governmentwide goal under the Small Business Act.  This 16 provision for servicedisabled veterans requires the VA 17 to set a higher goal. 18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  How high? 19             MR. SAUNDERS:  It doesn't  it doesn't 20 require the specific number.  It has to be higher than 21 3 percent.  And we're talking about  22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  That could be four percent. 23             MR. SAUNDERS:  It  it could be, but we're 24 talking about a period in time when there have been 25 goals since 1999, discretionary authority since 2003.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 And as of 2005, the government's progress towards its 2 3percent goal was .6, sixtenths of 1 percent. 3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, it sounds like the 4 government did very badly in meeting its goals.  And you 5 can understand why Congress would have done something to 6 say the government  and specifically the VA  has to 7 do a lot better toward meeting its goals. 8             But the goals are still, you know, pretty 9 far down compared to what Justice Breyer was indicating 10 is the natural tendency of this system that you're 11 describing to produce  you know, almost everything is 12 given to a veteran. 13             MR. SAUNDERS:  Well, where there is a 14 veteran that's eligible.  But even at the time that this 15 was done, the goals had always been a 3 percent 16 governmentwide goal.  Individual agencies were required 17 to set their goals based on the maximum practical 18 opportunity, and so even at the time going into this, 19 the VA had already set a higher goal.  I believe it was 20 7 percent. 21             The goals that it had set under the statute 22 have been even higher than that.  And the answer is, 23 yes, the government was expecting the VA  this to be 24 an important mandate for the VA because this was tied to 25 the VA's unique obligation to help veteranowned small

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You  you mentioned

3 that the  you've mentioned several times, I think,

4 that there has to be a veterans  veteranowned

5 business that's eligible as  as  but don't you think

6 there will be a lot more veteranowned businesses if you

7 prevail?  In other words, if everything is open to the

8 preference, as long as there is, you know, two that get

9 the preference, don't you think a lot more veterans 

10 won't it make a lot more sense for them to go into

11 business rather than some other line of work?

12             MR. SAUNDERS:  It may well be.  And Congress

13 would think that's fantastic.  We're 

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you shouldn't

15 be telling us that the limitation is that there's only

16 so many veteranowned businesses, because if you

17 prevail, there will be many times that.

18             MR. SAUNDERS:  Yeah.  And there could be,

19 and then that  you know, this was enacted at a time in

20 2006 where we were facing incredible unemployment rate

21 among veterans.  And so if this is encouraging formation

22 of more veteranowned small businesses 

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  I see many good things.

24 People would enlist in the Armed Forces.  They would

25 have careers assured after.  It just still surprises me,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
24 1 but my question is not really aimed at you.  It's aimed 2 at the other side, and you would have a chance to answer 3 this question. 4             I can understand.  I accept your argument, 5 pretty much.  I don't know why there would be any 6 exception to the SS  the FSS, or whatever it's called. 7             But I was rather stopped by the lower 8 court's argument which they have given up, which is that 9 right in the statute, not in a preference, but right in 10 the statute it says, "For purposes of meeting the 11 goals," under Section A.  That, I understand. 12             And then what you do is you'd have goals; 13 they should be tough goals, and  and if you're way 14 ahead of the goals, then maybe you don't have to do it. 15 That was their argument.  The government's given that 16 up. 17             So  so I don't know what to do.  I mean, 18 I'm going to ask them for help  19             MR. SAUNDERS:  But  20             JUSTICE BREYER:   and then  the same  21             MR. SAUNDERS:  The government has given that 22 up because the stated purpose of setting those goals was 23 to increase contracting opportunities.  And the House 24 report here was referring to tools to meet, if not 25 exceed, its contracting goals.  The goals were never
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
25 1 intended to be ceilings here.  And if, in retrospect, it 2 seems like there might be some mismatch between the 3 mandate and the goals, you have to remember that at this 4 time they were so far from meeting even the more modest 5 goals that Congress was thinking of this in mandatory 6 terms:  We have to do everything we can here to ramp up 7 this obligation, because the old approaches, the 8 discretionary approaches aren't working. 9             And the idea that in doing that they would, 10 without saying anything to that effect in the statute, 11 leave an enormous loophole that lets the agency take up 12 to 60 percent of its procurements off the top and just 13 send them straight to the FSS doesn't jive, especially 14 when you remember that at the time that the agency was 15 missing its goals, those contracting goals counted not 16 just open market contracts, but FSS orders were being 17 counted.  When the government was doing .6 against the 18 3 percent goal, that was both on the open market and on 19 the FSS.  Congress was worried about that failure across 20 the board and enacted a mandatory provision. 21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 22             Mr. Tripp. 23             ORAL ARGUMENT OF ZACHARY D.

Official

26

2             The mandate here applies when the VA awards

3 wholly new contracts, not when it places orders under

4 old ones.

5             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Tripp, would you

6 preliminarily explain why the government walked away

7 from what was a winning position in the Federal circuit?

8 I mean, it's really odd.  I read the Federal circuit

9 decision, and I expected to open the government brief

10 and say, yeah, the Federal circuit was right.

11             You're telling us the Federal circuit was

12 wrong.

13             MR. TRIPP:  I guess  about the Federal

14 circuit's position, we think the Federal circuit's

15 rationale is right, so far as it goes, but that it's

16 incomplete.  And so the Federal circuit has a complete

17 answer for why Petitioner's sort of maximalist position

18 is wrong, which is that if  if this mandate applies in

19 100 percent of procurements, then the secretary's

20 discretion to set goals is pretty much wiped out, and

21 it's hard to even talk about them as goals at all.  But

22 the fact that there needs to be discretion somewhere in

23 this scheme doesn't really answer where the discretion

24 needs to exist.

25             And the distinction that we're drawing 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 first, I want to be clear about the distinction that

27

2 we're drawing.  We're not saying that when you place an

3 order under a preexisting contract that that's not a

4 kind of contract; of course it is.  We say that outright

5 in our brief.  What we're saying is that when Congress

6 establishes a procedure that applies when an agency,

7 quote, awards contracts, that's naturally read to refer

8 to awarding wholly new contracts, not placing orders

9 under old ones.

10             JUSTICE ALITO:  Your answer to Justice

11 Ginsburg is that the Federal circuit was actually right

12 even though you disagree with its reasoning.  And isn't

13 the real answer to  is the real answer to this

14 question that the  the VA regulations don't say

15 anything about goals?

16             MR. TRIPP:  But it's not only that the VA

17 regulations don't say anything about goals.  It's that

18 the VA's regulations map up perfectly with the argument

19 that we're  we're  we're pressing here, which is

20 that this is a mandate that we apply in 100 percent of

21 procurements when we are awarding a wholly new contract.

22 We do it every single time under the regulations, but

23 those regulations never even come up.  You never 

24 like, a contracting officer doesn't begin a procurement

25 by turning to part 819.70 of the  of the FAR.  There's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 like a 5,000page document, right?

28

2             They can open up, march their way through,

3 place an FSS order under part  part 8.  And when you

4 place an order under a preexisting contract, the FAR is

5 crystal clear that you do not consider setaside

6 requirements.

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't quite 

8             MR. TRIPP:  And so the argument we're

9 advancing here is foursquare with the way our

10 regulations actually work and what our practices have

11 been on the ground since 2009.

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why is it that you

13 call these order  order contracts?  I look at 

14             MR. TRIPP:  Pardon?

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I look at your history,

16 and you, yourself, the government itself, calls these

17 orders order contracts.

18             MR. TRIPP:  An order is a kind of contract,

19 you know, under the 

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's not a kind.  It is

21 a contract.

22             MR. TRIPP:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a contract

23 under the 

24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So tell me what kind of

25 contract do you have, absent the order with the FSS

Alderson Reporting Company

1 vendor?

Official

29

2             MR. TRIPP:  Oh, under the FSS, there's

3 already a government contract between the United States

4 and the vendor to supply an indefinite quantity of  of

5 a certain category of products or services.  And so

6 we're placing an order under those preexisting

7 contracts.

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How difficult is it for

9 you to take the database that you have with respect to

10 what are veteranowned businesses.  Take that database,

11 look at it, look at what it is you need, a stapler, and

12 see if  how many vendors on that list supply staplers,

13 and then check that against the FSS?

14             MR. TRIPP:  It  it 

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If there's no veteran

16 that matches the FSS list, then you go to the FSS.

17             What's the problem with that 

18             MR. TRIPP:  If I could take a step back and

19 explain why this is so important to the VA.

20             The thing that we're most troubled by is

21 that Petitioner's position would block us from being

22 able to place orders under preexisting contracts.  The

23 whole point of the contract 

24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  You didn't listen

25 to me.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
30 1             You go to your veteranowned list; you're 2 looking for staplers.  You find five veteranowned 3 businesses on your list that sell staplers, but you want 4 to  you need an FSS supplier, because you don't want 5 to negotiate a new contract.  You don't want to do all 6 that hard work.  You check whether there are two or more 7 of those five on the FSS list. 8             MR. TRIPP:  All right.  So you're saying if 9 we were going to use the Rule of Two to choose among FSS 10 vendors who are already qualified  11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.  Exactly. 12             MR. TRIPP:   the first point about that is 13 that Petitioner would lose.  They are not a qualified 14 vendor. 15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't care about the 16 merits of whether it wins or loses.  I'm talking about 17 the legal issue. 18             What is so difficult about that? 19             MR. TRIPP:  Yeah.  A couple points about 20 that. 21             The  that would significantly narrow our 22 practical concerns.  Our practical concerns are mostly 23 driven by  by  by the interpretation that we would 24 not be able to place orders under preexisting contracts 25 at all.  We do this 85,000 times a year.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
31 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't  I don't  2             MR. TRIPP:  You know, this is very important 3 to us.  And so in our  our first position about that 4 is that we just don't think that Congress did that. 5 This statute is materially identical in its wording to 6 five earlier statutes, none of which have ever been 7 interpreted that way.  When Congress wanted to address 8 this  9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Except the FBA has 10 interpreted this contrary to you; so has the GAO. 11             MR. TRIPP:  The FBA  the FBA took that 12 position, and the FAR counsel, which represents the 13 entire procurement policy of a broad, panexecutive 14 branch procurement agency, rejected it.  So it said that 15 it was going to be unworkable, and that it was unclear 16 whether it would offer us a  17             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Tripp, I guess I'm not 18 sure I understand.  I mean, I understand your policy 19 concerns and  and the way you think this will damage 20 procurement practices.  But the statute just seems 21 pretty clear.  Once you say that this is a contract, 22 what you've said in your brief and right now.  And once 23 you say that, it just  the statute says, "A 24 contracting officer of the department shall award 25 contracts on the basis of competition restricted to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
32 1 veterans' small businesses."  So that seems to kind of 2 answer the case, whatever the policy identifications 3 are. 4             MR. TRIPP:  Well, I  I think the basic 5 problem with that is if you take that sort of  just 6 like sort of 1L understanding of contract and  and 7 blow it through  8             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it's your own 9 understanding of contract.  You just said this is  10             MR. TRIPP:  No, no. 11             JUSTICE KAGAN:   contract. 12             MR. TRIPP:  But  but the problem is that 13 there's many Federal procurement statutes that apply 14 when the  when the Federal government, quote, "awards 15 contracts."  That's what five prior small business 16 contracting preference statutes say.  They apply when 17 there are either awards contracts, award contract 18 opportunities, or reserves contracts.  And  and the 19 two most basic statutes in the area  20             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But as I understand it, all 21 of those contracts have a "may" in there. 22             MR. TRIPP:  No.  Two of them  23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Or almost all of them do. 24             MR. TRIPP:  Well, one of them has always had 25 a "shall."  One had "shall for 13 years."  But if I
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 could get to another 

33

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah, but  but most of

3 them have a "may."  But here you have  and  and the

4 "shall"s, the one or two that there are, have really

5 never been adjudicated by  certainly by this Court.

6             MR. TRIPP:  Right.

7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So the question is, well,

8 there we are.  We are, you know, for the first time

9 deciding what this language means, and this language

10 means that you shall award contracts on the basis of

11 this restricted competition.  And you say this is a

12 contract, so you know, end of case.

13             MR. TRIPP:  Well, so a couple points.

14 The  the very basic statutes that govern sealed

15 bidding and negotiated bidding, the most heavyweight

16 procedures for awarding a new contract, they both say

17 that the government shall award a contract under those

18 procedures.  And if you extend those to the FSS, that

19 would totally break.

20             The whole point of entering into these kinds

21 of contracts upfront is that you don't have to do that

22 again and again.  And when a local VA hospital needs to

23 order like stents or wheelchairs or an ultrasound

24 machine 

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But I don't understand

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
34 1 your policy argument.  Why is it so tough for you to  2 to get those things from an FSS  from an FSS vendor if 3 it's a veteran?  I mean  4             MR. TRIPP:  Well, I mean, we often do. 5 We're  we're currently  6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This year  7             MR. TRIPP:  We're currently exceeding our 8 goals on  if you look only at our FSS spending at  9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the question  I 10 think the question is, it's  it's a matter of just  11             MR. TRIPP:  Yeah. 12             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   pushing a second button 13 on the computer. 14             MR. TRIPP:  No, it's not.  It's  15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  First of all, I want to 16 see what  what's the FSS  FSS, and then I want to 17 see if there are any veteransowned businesses that 18 provide that service or that product on the FSS.  push 19 two buttons.  That's it. 20             MR. TRIPP:  Yeah.  I think that  the 21 practical, sort of, front end of how difficult  if we 22 are  if we're talking about using the Rule of Two to 23 choose among qualified FSS vendors, how difficult is it 24 to do that, the upfront cost is not that big.  The  25 the bigger concern, practical concern that we would have
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 is the litigation risk that that would expose.

35

2             Right now, our choice of whether to do a

3 setaside when choosing among FSS vendors, that is

4 committed to agency discretion by law because when

5 Congress addressed this point headon in 644(r), it said

6 that agencies may, at their discretion, do this.

7             But if suddenly the Rule of Two applies in

8 every case, then in every case a disappointed bidder can

9 come in and say, oh, no, you've misapplied the Rule of

10 Two.  You should have thought that they 

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, in every case

12 there has to be  we're dealing with small 

13 veteranowned small businesses.  The examples you gave,

14 stents, wheelchairs, ultrasound machines, are there many

15 small businesses that provide ultrasound machines?

16             MR. TRIPP:  I guess I  I don't know about

17 ultrasound machines, but we've bought things like 

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There are expensive,

19 big things that you expect you have to be a big company

20 to provide, like an ultrasound machine, or you mentioned

21 stents.

22             Now maybe if they're commodities, then to

23 provide fair price and best value, it also would help to

24 be a big business as opposed to a small business.  Let

25 me  I  I can't imagine the small business is going

TRIPP:  Of our FSS  when we're 14 spending on the FSS, 13  15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So I should 16 discount your parade of horribles argument by 87 17 percent.  It's really not as horrible as it sounds. 18             MR. TRIPP:  Our concern isn't placing an 19 order.  We're happy  we're happy.  One of our  20 we're  we're  like this statute has had enormous 21 effect on our procurement.  We're happy to help 22 veteranowned small businesses, but it's only one of our 23 priorities, right?  Our number one agency priority is 24 caring for veterans. 25             And so our concern is that if you  if you
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
37 1 apply this with this wooden mandate across the board in 2 every case, that it would seriously impair our ability 3 to deliver the quality care that we're trying to 4 deliver. 5             JUSTICE BREYER:  Is this the case?  Do I 6 understand this?  Am I  there are three parts to this. 7 Question one in my mind, is it the case that they lose 8 because the agency does not have to apply veterans only 9 where they way exceeded their goal? 10             The answer to that in the opinion would say, 11 we do not reach that question for there are no 12 regulations that suggest that the agency has tried to 13 take that approach.  Am I right so far? 14             MR. TRIPP:  That has tried to take the 15 approach of saying that we drop it if we're way over  16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Correct. 17             MR. TRIPP:  Yeah, right.  Okay. 18             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Then we reach 19 question two, left one open. 20             Question 2 is do they have to choose the 21 Rule of Two in the FSS?  And there are two parts to 22 that.  The first part is suppose two veterans qualified 23 are already on the FSS list.  And there we might say, 24 yes, you do in respect to them.  Or we might say, no, 25 you don't.  But if we say yes, you do, at least we
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
38 1 don't, in your opinion, wreck the system.  All right. 2             Then we get to Step 3.  There is no veteran 3 on the FSS.  Now what do we do?  And there your argument 4 is that, look, everyone on the FSS is a person who has 5 entered into a contract, which contract says that when 6 called upon for further supply, they will give it.  Am I 7 right? 8             MR. TRIPP:  Yes. 9             JUSTICE BREYER:  So, therefore, it is that 10 contract, not the contract within the contract that 11 they're talking about.  And were we to say the contrary, 12 we would have to take an architect who has 40,000 pages 13 of things he's going to do, and we change the sentence 14 on page 389 to read 300 rather than 400, and we say 15 that's a new contract, or something like that.  I'm 16 trying to make an argument for you.  It's not a contract 17 within a contract, it is contract to which this refer. 18 Am I way off base or is that what you're trying to say? 19             MR. TRIPP:  I think that's  20             JUSTICE BREYER:  And don't just say it is 21 because you think I'd agree with it, please. 22             (Laughter.) 23             MR. TRIPP:  I  I don't think that's 24 exactly what we're trying to say.  And  and it's a 25 little hard to know 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Well, if it

39

2 isn't that, look, these people on the FSS list have

3 already entered into a contract, this is just

4 implementing the contract that they've already entered

5 into.  If you're not saying that, then how in heaven's

6 name do you get out of his argument?

7             MR. TRIPP:  We're saying that when we place

8 an order under a preexisting contract, that that is not

9 awarding a new  awarding a contract within the meaning

10 of these procurement statutes.

11             There have been  I  I really do want to

12 emphasize the historical context that's built up over

13 decades about the understanding of this phrase,

14 "throughout Federal procurement law," right?  There's

15 five prior statutes on exactly this same subject, and

16 every one of them has been interpreted by the FAR to be

17 categorically inapplicable when placing orders under

18 preexisting contracts.

19             And the  one of the things that's very

20 troubling about their position is that if you say, well,

21 we want to read a lot into this special provision,

22 8127(d), it was intended to help veterans, but there's

23 nothing special about the language.  It's almost

24 identical to the language of the HUBZone preference that

25 was in place from 1997 to 2000 that had  that had 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 sorry, 1997 to 2010 that had exactly the same shall

40

2 award a contract opportunity.  I mean, it was very

3 powerful.  And that the whole  the whole time since

4 1978, Congress has had a provision in place saying that

5 each contract in a small dollar range shall be reserved

6 exclusively for  for small businesses.

7             And if you 

8             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Tripp, this is an 

9 an overarching problem.  The  the argument which you

10 state very well is very complex.  The Federal circuit

11 had a really simple take on it, and all of these

12 regulations and provisions that you are mentioning

13 didn't figure at all in  in the Federal circuit's

14 opinion.  So you're putting us in the position of being

15 a court of first view in a rather dense area.  This 

16 this Court usually doesn't do that.  It likes to know

17 what 

18             MR. TRIPP:  Right.

19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   other judges have

20 thought about it.

21             MR. TRIPP:  Yes, I  and I  I totally

22 understand that concern.  And, you know, obviously, our

23 firstline position is that we're right for the reasons

24 that we say in our brief.  This traces through all of

25 the Federal procurement statutes.  It wouldn't upset

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
41 1 the  the way things work in this area of the law, and 2 we think we're also entitled to Chevron deference.  And 3 for that reason, we think you could affirm. 4             But we also said in your mootness briefing 5 that we think it would be fair to send this back to the 6 lower courts to consider these arguments in the first 7 instance  8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Consider  9             MR. TRIPP:   we  we recognize that. 10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Consider the 11 argument, or consider mootness? 12             MR. TRIPP:  Consider both.  But  13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What  what factors does 14 the secretary look to when the secretary sets goals? 15 Because I'm going back to the argument about for 16 purposes of meeting the goals. 17             MR. TRIPP:  I mean, the  18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What  what  what 19 standards does the Congress impose on the secretary when 20 the secretary sets the goals? 21             MR. TRIPP:  It  it  the goals are 22 committed to his discretion, except for that the goal  23 the minimum goal needs to be at least 3 percent.  The 24 goals since the statute has gone into effect have been 25 in the range of 10 percent and 12 percent.  And I want
Alderson Reporting Company

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What does he 

3             MR. TRIPP:   the nightandday impact.

4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What does he consider in

5 deciding whether to go 5, 10, 15?  The risk of

6 litigation?  The higher the goal is?  Or 

7             MR. TRIPP:  No, I  no, I think  I guess,

8 I  I would  I would have to  to speculate on that,

9 but I think it's more the sort of practical reality of

10 what seems like a  a goal, something that we

11 could push forward that's attainable, but  but not

12 unrealistic.  And  and I 

13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if the discretion is

14 that broad, then it seems to me that maybe the Federal

15 circuit was wrong, that these goals are simply

16 aspirational.  But that doesn't have any real effect on

17 the operation of the statute.

18             MR. TRIPP:  Well, they have a huge impact on

19 the way that we actually procure, right?

20             This has had  I mean, the statute 

21 before the statute was enacted, we were falling short of

22 even the 3 percent goal.  Now the goals are in the range

23 of 10 to 12  10 to 12 percent, and in most years we're

24 crushing these goals, right?  We're beating them, even

25 on the FSS, where we're  we're not applying the Rule

Alderson Reporting Company

1 of Two.

Official

43

2             But we're doing two other very important

3 things for veterans.  We put a thumb on the scale when

4 we're considering offers that were submitted within the

5 FSS by veterans.  And we also do setasides under

6 644(r), the statute where Congress spoke very directly

7 to this and said that we may, at our discretion, set

8 aside orders placed against multipleaward schedule

9 contracts.  We do those setasides, and the  and the

10 results have been very dramatic.

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When  I'm sorry.

12 When you say you're crushing the goals, that means

13 you're meeting them?

14             (Laughter.)

15             MR. TRIPP:  We're  sorry.  Sorry.

16             We're  we're far exceeding them.  In  in

17 many years we're  we're nearly doubling them.  And I

18 think this is something that we  we have  this has

19 had a huge impact on  on our operations.  I think we

20 think it's had a big impact on the veterans' community.

21             But the  the  our concern is that if you

22 take this sort of mechanical Rule of Two and apply it,

23 especially in the  sort of the blocking interpretation

24 that Petitioner has been  been pressing, that we would

25 not be able to place an order at all.

1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you please 

44

2             JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you explain 

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   explain to me 

4             JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you  could you

5 explain why the FS  use of the FSS was important with

6 respect to this particular contract?  You provide

7 examples of the VA's ordering standard commodities like

8 a stent, or pencils, or something like that.  But this

9 was  my understanding  maybe this is not right 

10 this was a custom service that you were seeking, and 

11             MR. TRIPP:  Yes.

12             JUSTICE ALITO:   what you did was to

13 solicit a quote from a single contractor.

14             So how does that fit in with the arguments

15 you're making about the need to use the FSS?

16             MR. TRIPP:  It  it sort of  two things

17 about this.  The  the  this is a somewhat unusual

18 bid because  there  there is not explanation in the

19 record because  because this case was just litigated

20 on the agreed facts about the procedure.

21             The much more common  the  the VA orders

22 a lot of services on the FSS.  It's like one of the

23 major ways that people  that agencies purchase

24 services.  And the  the standard way of doing it,

25 it's  it's  you know, it's not like Amazon.com, but

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 you can go on to a website, drill down, see all the

45

2 vendors who  who are already prequalified to provide

3 that kind of service.  And the standard way that you

4 would do this is that you would request  request

5 quotes from at least three of them, and then consider

6 them when they come in.

7             And when you request  request the quote

8 from them, even if you request it from three or four of

9 them, every vendor on the schedule who is preapproved

10 will  will see that it's open and can submit an offer,

11 and then  and then the  the agency would consider

12 all the offers that were given to it, and it picks the

13 one that offers the best value.

14             So that's how it would work if we were doing

15 something like hiring a temporary psychiatrist at a 

16 at a new  at a new  expanding a medical center in

17 Des Moines or something.

18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  One of the amicus briefs

19 suggests that the VA is now doing increasingly complex

20 procurements by way of the FSS.  That we have it in our

21 heads that this is all about, you know, staples and

22 paperclips, but that, in fact, the FSS is being used to

23 do things that would previously have been done on the

24 open market.

25             MR. TRIPP:  I  I  I  well, first, I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 want to emphasize that the VA's primary use of this,

46

2 again  this is not  I'm not talking about staples

3 and paperclips.  We're talking about, you know, the 

4 the medicalrelated stuff, the, you know, wheelchairs,

5 stents, all that  temporary staffing services.

6             But yes, a lot of the FSS  even for more

7 complex procurement, the FSS is still substantially

8 easier.  And the FSS, you tend to already be sort of

9 aggregating the government's buying power.  And so the

10 pricing is  the idea of the  of the FSS is that it's

11 both easier to do and that the price will ordinarily be

12 lower.

13             And so  I mean, the  the agency wouldn't

14 be going into the FSS if the agency didn't think that

15 that was the  the best approach.  And in fact,

16 whenever the procurement is over half a million dollars,

17 I believe, the FAR requires the contracting officer to

18 make an affirmative, express determination on exactly

19 that point:  That  that going through the FSS is going

20 to provide the best value for us overall.

21             And I  and just to respond to Petitioner's

22 effort to put a lot of weight onto the bestvalue

23 language in the  in the Rule of Two, I'm a little

24 confused by that because  exactly because when 

25 whenever the agency is placing an order under the FSS,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 under the FAR, that  that the  the contracting

47

2 officer is making a determination that that order is the

3 best value.  So I  I guess I just  I  I feel like

4 that  that may just collapse on its own weight.  I

5 don't  I don't quite understand where that argument

6 goes.

7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Tripp, can  can I ask,

8 what effect would this statute really have on your view?

9 As I understand it, the government does have to use the

10 Rule of Two on all openmarket purchases; is that right?

11             MR. TRIPP:  Under the statute, our

12 regulations implemented it, yes.

13             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Above, like, a very low

14 threshold?  Is it 3,500, something like that?

15             MR. TRIPP:  Yes.  Right, right.

16             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So  so if you're right,

17 what did this statute actually accomplish?  In other

18 words, you already have to use the Rule of Two for

19 openmarket purchases, or almost all of them.

20             MR. TRIPP:  Oh, right.

21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  What does the statute do?

22             MR. TRIPP:  Yes.  It  so 8127(d) has a 

23 has a huge effect, because under the  just the  sort

24 of the regular FAR, you just have to do a setaside for

25 small businesses, right?  That's  that's sort of norm

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 under the  under the Rule of Two.

48

2             But under 8127(d), this required to  to

3 restrict competition only to veteranowned small

4 businesses who are in our database.  So this is a far

5 more 

6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Who 

7             MR. TRIPP:  Only in our  who are verified

8 as veteranowned in our database.

9             So this is a far more powerful preference

10 than the  than  than the ordinary preference in 

11 in the FAR, or even when you take that and you couple it

12 with section 8128, which they mention in the brief,

13 which gets at, again, just sort of putting a  a bit of

14 a thumb on the scale.  Restricting competition is a very

15 powerful thing, and it has a huge effect.

16             So again, I think, I just want to emphasize

17 at  at closing that our  our major concern is with

18 Petitioner's sort of blocking interpretation that would

19 prevent us from  from placing orders at all, even when

20 we have them in place, and even when we could place

21 orders with another veteranowned small business.

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And you still haven't

23 answered my question fully.

24             If we limit that to preexisting orders where

25 there is two or more veterans 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. TRIPP:  Yes.  And I  and  and 

49

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   on the same practical

3 consequences.

4             MR. TRIPP:  The  the practical

5 consequences are much narrower.  I have  but I have a

6 lot of trouble seeing how you limit that to this statute

7 when the language of this statute is materially

8 identical to 

9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Like we limit everything

10 else.  Once we say what we think, Congress then decides

11 what it's going to do in the future.

12             MR. TRIPP:  Are  are they 

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right now, there are no

14 statutes like that.

15             MR. TRIPP:  No, no, no.  There is  there

16 is five others on  on the exact subject of

17 smallbusiness contracting preferences, and especially

18 644(j), which applies across the government and says

19 that each contract 

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The Small Business

21 Administration has read it the way Kingdomware 

22             MR. TRIPP:  No, that  but that was

23 decisively rejected by the FAR counsel, the

24 governmentwide body that considered this.  They said it

25 was unworkable, and it was unclear that it was going to

50 1 have a significant upside.  Congress responded to the 2 FAR council by enacting 644(r) and establishing a 3 procedure to do that, but making it discretionary in all 4 cases. 5             And if you extend the Rule of Two mandate 6 there, first of all, it would expose us to lots of 7 litigation.  But I  I  again, I don't see how you 8 restrict that to this statute and not all the other 9 ones. 10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do  do you know what 11 proportion of the VA's annual purchases are under the 12 FSS? 13             MR. TRIPP:  By dollar? 14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  Is it 5 percent, 15 or  16             MR. TRIPP:  I think it's about 20 percent. 17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  20? 18             MR. TRIPP:  About 20 percent, yes. 19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was the 60 percent? 20 There was a 60 percent figure. 21             MR. TRIPP:  The  the 60 percent is by 22 transaction volume.  You know, a lot of the FSS orders 23 tend to be relatively small dollar order.  So there's a 24 lot more of them, but they don't add up to as many 25 dollars.

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  What are the kinds of things

3 that aren't done under the FSS?  Like, what's the

4 remaining 80?

5             MR. TRIPP:  Well, you know, a big part of

6 that are orders that we do under other contracts.  So 

7 so, right, we spend $4 billion a year ordering

8 pharmaceuticals under a preexisting contract.  And  I

9 mean, if we couldn't do that, that would be really,

10 really devastating to our just basic operations.

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, how  do you

12 know how many veteranowned businesses would be able to

13 offer the best value on pharmaceuticals to the VA?

14             MR. TRIPP:  No.  What I'm  what I'm 

15 if  I think actually if the question is just, you

16 know, to  if  if a small business needed to deliver

17 some penicillin to a  a local hospital for an

18 individual order by a local hospital, I don't know,

19 maybe a veteranowned small business could do that.

20             What we've done is to  is  as 

21 actually, as Congress directed us in Section 8125, they

22 required us to buy these things on national contracts or

23 on the FSS, and so that's what we've done.  And so we

24 strategically source all of our pharmaceutical

25 purchases, or almost all of them, through this one

SAUNDERS:  Thank you. 11             This case should begin and end for this 12 Court with the concession that in the ordinary sense of 13 the term, an order under the FSS is a contract. 14 Congress chose sweeping language here in acting its 15 mandate, and that language encompasses FSS orders.  And 16 to the extent there are, you know, changes that would 17 need to be made or other policy considerations, those 18 can be made by Congress in the future.  But the policy 19 consideration it made is  is embodied in the statutory 20 language it chose. 21             Now, the idea that we're going to come back 22 and limit this based on a specialized meaning of the 23 word "contract," we should remember that that argument 24 is not one that appeared in this case until the 25 government's merits brief in this Court.

53 1             If it's a settled background interpretation 2 that  that Congress was incorporating that limitation 3 into the Act, you think it would have occurred to them 4 in the last decade, the carveouts for the Small 5 Business Act exceptions were never justified based on 6 providing a narrower meaning of the word "contract," and 7 on their face were expressly limited to the Small 8 Business Act, the provision that applied to part 19 of 9 the FAR implementing the Small Business Act. 10             Well, to the extent there's an exception for 11 the Small Business Act, well, Congress came in here is 12 it rejected the Small Business Act approach.  Rather 13 than continuing to tinker within the framework of the 14 Small Business Act where this exception applied, it said 15 we're taking this mandate out of the Small Business Act, 16 we're going to narrow it, it's not going to be a 17 governmentwide mandate, but we're going to apply it 18 specifically to the VA in light of its unique 19 obligations and set the VA up as the driver of 20 procurement in this area; have it set the example for 21 the rest of the government. 22             Congress was making  balancing these 23 policy considerations.  It wasn't going to be blundering 24 into something that was administratively unworkable. 25 And if you  the dire consequences that we're hearing

54 1 today really stood any chance of coming to pass, I don't 2 think that you would have the American Legion, the Iraq 3 and Afghanistan veterans, 41 members of Congress, who 4 care deeply about veterans issues, supporting 5 Kingdomware's position in this case. 6             The reality is if the government's only 7 doing 20 percent of its procurements from FSS, you're 8 already talking about a broad mandate.  And then with 9 respect to those existing ones, you have to have a 10 business that is eligible, it has to appear in the 11 database, and it has to be able to offer a fair and 12 reasonable price and best value. 13             And as the  the Chief Justice discussed 14 for some of these big order commodity contracts, that 15 it's going to be a difficult fight for the  for the 16 drugs that are being offered here, there's a statutory 17 provision that says that the government acquires its 18 drugs at 76 percent of the average price that 19 wholesalers pay to the manufacturers.  So take the 20 average price that anyone else in the world can get from 21 the manufacturer and do a big discount on top of that. 22 Those are tough terms to beat. 23             And so I think that there's going to be  24 you know, the reality here is not the dire consequences 25 that you're seeing, and the policy judgment is for

55 1 Congress.  And believe me, if anything in this mandate 2 enforced as written is going to hurt veterans in any 3 way, then you can expect Congress will act swiftly to 4 correct that problem. 5             But none of this supports the sweeping 6 carveout that the government is saying that it doesn't 7 even have to look at its own database.  It doesn't have 8 to consider a single veteranowned small business, no 9 matter how competitive it would be, because it can go 10 straight to the Federal suppliers. 11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What response do you have 12 to judge  Justice Ginsburg's question that really 13 you're making us a court of first impression here? 14 Shouldn't we send this back? 15             MR. SAUNDERS:  I don't think we should 16 because the meaning of "contract," this is a straightup 17 question of law.  And the reality is that the veterans 18 who are waiting for this law to be enforced as written 19 have already waited a decade.  And for  to send it 20 back and have additional delay on a pure question of law 21 based on a new argument that the government's making for 22 the first time here sets a very bad precedent. 23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 24             The case is submitted. 25             (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the
