That interpretation is grounded on more than three decades of agency pronouncements and reflects the collective judgment and expertise of the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA in administering the Act."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "Justice Kennedy, it's always one or the other. The Clean Water Act establishes two permitting regimes. And I think this is actually something where the parties agree. Either it's going to be permitted under section 402 of the Act, which covers pollutants generally but not the discharge of dredged material, or fill material, which is covered by section 404 of the Act."

    "speech": "As a practical matter, for example, if you take the slurry in this case, which is 55 percent solid by volume, there is going to be liquid coming out of that pipe with the slurry, but under the definition that the agencies administer of fill material, this is fill material under that definition."

  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "But it does -- here's the problem that I am having and I think others may have. We start, number one, with a definition, as I understand it, of a pollutant that includes suspended solids. Number two, there is an existing regulation to the effect that wastewater from this particular method of extracting gold shall simply not be released, shall not be put into a water body. And then the two agencies come along and in effect they say by regulation, if the suspended solid in effect comes out of a mine, or if the wastewater has got suspended solid in it, we are going to call it \"fill\" and leave it entirely to the Army Engineers under 404, subject to an EPA veto. And on the face of it, it sounds as though they are simply, number one, defining one -- one variant of pollution out of the EPA's jurisdiction, and, number two, with respect to the wastewater, in effect coming up with a contradictory determination about what should be done with it. And it sounds as though, under the Administrative Procedure Act, that with the statutory and the regulatory regime on the one hand and this joint regulation on the other, you've simply got a flat contradiction, and query whether that can be anything other than arbitrary and capricious under the APA. Will you address that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "Sure, Justice Souter. First of all, I those concerns really go to the definition of \"fill material,\" and I don't think that the Respondent SEACC has squarely challenged that definition in this case. And I would point you to two parts of the record."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "Well, let's assume -- and I don't mean to cut you off there, but before you're done -- I am at least raising it because I find it very difficult to get a handle on this case without dealing with that problem. So you may say, well, they didn't raise it well enough, but I still want you to deal with it on the merits."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "Sure. And let me just point to the two parts of the record: The JA at 541 note 12, where the Ninth Circuit acknowledged they didn't challenge it; and also I would point you to the complaint, where the complaint is directed to the permits and does not seek a determination that the Fill Rule definition is arbitrary and capricious. We think that that definition reflects the settled understanding and expertise of both agencies, the Army Corps of Engineers --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "How could it be settled, because isn't it a fact that before 2002 if the primary purpose was disposing of waste that the 402 permit applied?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "That is correct, Justice Ginsburg. By \"settled,\" I mean it was settled in 2002. They adopted this rule."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "So it's not in 30 years' experience, and when it was disposing of waste, it was under 402 until 2002."

    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "I think the EPA has always adopted and applied an effects test for determining whether or not a discharge is fill material --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But in fact, was there ever a permit by the Corps of Engineers when the purpose was disposal of waste? Was there ever a 404 permit, rather than a 402, for disposal of what they call \"processed wastewater\" or \"wastewater\"?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "There was a period, of course, Justice Ginsburg -- you are right -- where the Army Corps of Engineers adopted a primary purpose test. During that period -- you are right -- 404 permits were not -- were not issued for the discharge of things where the purpose was not to fill the lake; it was to dispose of material. Now, during that period, though, those discharges were not regulated under section 402 of the Act and under Section 306, the effluent guidelines, but for a different reason. The reason why that they weren't regulated under 402 during that period is because of the agencies' wastewater treatment exception, which is found at 40 C.F.R. 122.2, where the agencies excepted from the definition of the \"waters of the United States\" discharges into an impoundment area. And what you have going on here is the discharge of fill material into an impoundment area, which is dammed off with a 50-foot dam. Those discharges, in this case, are governed by section 404 of the Act. But any discharges from that impoundment area into downstream waters of the United States are subject to section 402 of the Act -- there's a separate permit in this case -- and are subject to the effluent guidelines and the new source performance standards. So you have those two. The agencies have come together. They've reconciled the statutory regimes, and they have the 404 permit of dredged material, material that's going to fill the bottom of the lake, raise it by 50 feet, governed by section 404 of the Act. That impoundment area then is sealed off, and any discharged material out of that impoundment area into waters of the United States is going to be governed by 402 and the separate effluent guidelines there. That --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "That's pretty cold comfort when you treat as an impoundment area a natural lake. I suppose if the -- if it's proper to do what they're doing here, then the lake in the middle of the Everglades is an impoundment area, or a Great Salt Lake is an impoundment area."

    "speaker": "GARRE",

    "speech": "This is a long way from a settling pond."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "Well, let me address that in two different ways: First of all, at the end of this project, when the lake is going to be reclaimed, the agencies determined that it's going to be environmentally as sound, if not superior, for the habitats in Alaska, fish and wildlife. So at the end of the project, it is going to be --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "Yes, but what's that -- what's that got to do with the definition of \"impoundment area\"? My problem is that you are treating -- the Corps is treating as an impoundment area a whole natural lake as distinct from a settling basin."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "The statute refers to specified disposal sites and what you have here, you are right, is a lake. But it's impounded by a 50-foot dam. The other part I wanted to point to is the section 404 guidelines are rigorous environmental guidelines that address a number of different concerns, including the quality of the water, the fish and wildlife habitat, and at the end of that process you have got the EPA, which has the right to exercise a veto over --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "You keep saying they are rigorous. My understanding is -- and I didn't think it was seriously disputed here -- is that during the period in which the deposits are going to be made, the natural life of this water body is going to be destroyed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "That's true."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "And the Corps comes along and says, oh, when it's all over, it will come back. But when you're destroying the entire living sort of corpus of this lake, it seems to me that it's getting more lenient to say that there are rigorous environmental standards."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "That's true, Justice Souter, but it's important to keep in mind that the reason why the lake -- the fish in the lake are not going to survive is because of the fill effect of the material, not because of any toxics put into the water."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "No, but as I understand it, and you correct me if I am wrong here, I thought \"suspended solids,\" I guess is the buzz word for it, is a form of pollution.  So you're saying, well, we're destroying the fish with one form of pollution rather than another form of pollution. And I don't know that that advances the ball for your side."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "Any time you have fill material going into the waters of the United States -- of course, section 404 doesn't apply until you've got fill material going into the waters of the United States."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "Yes, but this comes back to my initial question. You are simply, or the Corps is simply, defining what would otherwise be a pollutant, suspended solids discharged into the water, by calling it fill material. And it -- in effect it's defining one subject of -- of discharge regulation right out of the law of the United States by redefining it and saying, oh, it doesn't exist if it's coming out of a mine."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "I think what the agencies have done to reconcile their definitions is to apply this effects test. Now, if Coeur Alaska sought to fill the entire lake --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "But to apply the effects test, the legal effect, is it not, is to define one form of pollution as no longer existent so long as that form of pollution falls within the Corps of Engineers definition of \"fill.\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "I don't think that's correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "Is that correct?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "The legal effect is to regulate that pollution under section 404."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "General Garre, I don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but what's the environmental alternative to what was done here?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "The primary environmental alternative considered was a dry tailings alternative. And that would be been problematic in two different ways. One, it would have required the destruction of some 100 acres of wetlands; and two, it would have resulted in enormous stacks of tailings, 100 to 200 high, thousands of feet wide, that would actually dwarf the Pentagon and be visible from nearby Berners Bay. Now, the Army Corps of Engineers, the State of Alaska, and the Forest Service determined that the wet tailings option, putting the tailings into a lake, and reclaiming that lake so that it would be environmentally superior, was the preferable option. I do want to emphasize that if this Court has any doubt about the statutory text the regulatory decisions here go back more than 30 years. In 1973 the EPA adopted a rule that said that the discharge of fill material is not regulated under the section 402 permitting system. In 2002, in the preamble to the fill rule, the agency made clear again EPA has never regulated the discharge of fill material under the effluent guidelines."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Weren't they then thinking of fill material as material that was used either to fill in, to reclaim land, or in a construction project? I mean, to call filling a lake, to call that a fill, when what it's doing is providing a disposal place for a mining operation, it's not what one ordinarily thinks of as a filling operation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "Not the Environmental Protection Agency. The Environmental Protection Agency since the passage of the Clean Water Act has taken the position that discharge that has the effect of changing the bottom elevation of a water is going to be fill. And that makes sense as a practical matter. The agencies with 30 years of experience determined that the purpose definition that the Corps had adopted for a period was unworkable, unpredictable and didn't make sense. And I think that if there's any judgment that the courts ought to defer to here, it's the judgment of the agencies based on their collective experience as to the proper definition of \"fill material.\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "There's one question that Justice Souter raised and before you sit down I would like to get your answer, and that is, can anything, any water of the United States that the Corps of Engineers decides is appropriate to be used as a disposal place, can any waterway be a settling pond? That is, here we have a lake. And is it just up to the Corps of Engineers? They say this is a settling pond, it's a settling pond?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "I think as a practical matter if you put discharge into a river and it may not change the bottom elevation, that wouldn't be fill material. But, Justice Ginsburg, there have been a number of hypotheticals raised by Respondents here. Let me address those. The section 404 process is a rigorous environmental process, the EPA does have veto authority. We haven't seen these problems at all in the six years that the fill definition has been in place and I think it's simply untenable to suggest that these standards, which in section 4 require water quality determinations, wildlife, aquatic determination, would result in the sort of environmental harm that Respondents have hypothesized, and the prospect of that harm is no basis for this Court to override the statutory scheme that Congress created with two distinct permitting regimes, one for fill material, one for other pollutants, and to override the agency's pronouncements, interpretations for more than 30 years. And the other agency document I wanted to point to is very important. It's the 2004 mine tailings memorandum, which is contained at JA-141 to 146. In that memorandum, which is a 2004 memo by the heads of the EPA water divisions, they explain the application of the statutory and the regulatory scheme to these types of discharges, discharges that fill material into the impoundment is going to be subject to 404 and the rigorous process there. Any discharges out of that impoundment area is going to be subject to the rigorous requirements of 402 and that agency interpretation is entitled to deference."

The other is \"other, except as permitted under section 404,\" administered by the EPA. A discharge, in answer to your question, Justice Kennedy, may be governed by one program or the other, not both. Everybody admits that, including the Respondents. The fill rule --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "It's mutually exclusive in terms of the issuing agency, and I think that's a very important point. We want to emphasize that, that the rules pursuant to which the Corps of Engineers administers the fill permit are the 404(b)(1) rules which Congress specified to be enacted by the EPA. So the rigorous rules governing the quality of the water that's going to be affected by these fill permits are established by the EPA. Furthermore, the State is involved, the fisheries departments are involved, the conservation area of the State of Alaska. Many different agencies are involved in this permitting process. The permits in this case followed 900 studies, the expenditure of $26 million, an evaluation by the EPA, the Corps of Engineers, the department of conservation of Alaska, and, Justice Stevens' point, finally before the permit could be issued it had to go to the EPA and the EPA had the power to veto the permit. Now, Congress determined --"
  },

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",

Section 402, the EPA program, is governed by those effluent limitations under 301 and 306 and standards of performance. Congress made a choice of applying section 307, which are toxic effluent limitations that apply to the 404 permits. That 307 regime which Congress selected, which is also endorsed by the EPA in the rules that the -- that the Corps must follow in administering the permit -- that 307 provision to which I just referred to is in the 404(b)(1) regime rules. So all of this, the permitting process, which Congress made the decision to put into two baskets: Either it's fill material or it's except permits under --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "What happens if the agencies disagree as to whether it's fill? If 404 says it's fill, EPA says it isn't, can the EPA then veto it on that ground?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "The -- the -- yes. I -- I think the answer to that is yes. But the better answer to that, Justice Kennedy, is for a while, as -- as General Garre pointed out, the EPA had a different concept of what was fill than the Corps of Engineers. The EPA right from the beginning said it would be the effect on the -- on the water. The Corps for a while had that definition. Then it used a purpose test. Both agencies, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers, agreed in 2002 that that \"purpose\" definition of the word \"fill\" was not workable. It was too subjective."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",

    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "Well, there could be disagreement, but I was just about to say that this rule was jointly adopted by the Corps of Engineers and the EPA in 2002.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "The definition that was adopted, if I have it right, was the EPA definition. That was the effect. And it was the Corps that had the purpose test. And yet, until 2002, if I understand correctly, if the only reason of raising the elevation of the lake was to dispose of waste, you didn't get a 404 permit. That was not a 404 situation until 2002."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "OLSON",
    "speech": "That's -- that's -- except in the early stage, as I understand it, the Corps and -- the Corps also used the \"effects\" test. Then there was a period of time when it used a \"purpose\" test. The EPA consistently used the -- the \"effects\" test. In --"

    "speech": "That's -- that's -- until that point, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. But the two agencies that were involved in this process determined that that was not a workable test. It didn't function well. It allowed too much evasion and -- and manipulation, and they both came together after long studies and decided a reasonable interpretation that was effective, consistent, and workable. Under the Clean Water Act, both agencies came together and decided that the definition included the placement of overburden, slurry, tailings, or similar mining-related materials. Now, to the extent there is any ambiguity in the statute, this is the reasoned judgment, notice-and- comment rulemaking by the two agencies given responsibility."

I mean, it just can't be that simply because they poured a lot of it in and it fills up the bottom of the lake that suddenly the EPA can't regulate it any more. Now, that -- that -- since that's so counterintuitive, that all you have to do is take a terrible pollutant and fill the bottom of the lake with it and now it's up to the Army Corps of Engineers and not up to the EPA -- that's so counterintuitive that I assume I don't understand the statute, and you will explain it to me."

And what's being put in this settling area, this lake, is the sand, which is the same consistency of the bottom of the lake. It's inert material. It does not changing the chemical composition. It is not hurting the water quality of the lake."

    "speaker": "WALDO",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In section 306(e), Congress enacted an unqualified prohibition against operating any new source in violation of any standard of performance applicable to the source. The standard of performance at issue in this case is applicable on its face to the formula at the Kensington mine. It says there shall be no discharge of processed wastewater into navigable waters from mills that use the froth-flotation process."

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Of course, the provision that authorizes permits begins by saying \"Except as provided in sections 1328 and 1344,\" and 1344 is 404. So why doesn't that just take the 404 regime completely out of what you were just talking about? "
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALDO",
    "speech": "Because that's only a statement about whether section 402 applies. It means that if you have a section 404 permit, you don't also need a section 402 permit. It doesn't say anything about whether a 404 permit is appropriate under any particular circumstances, and it doesn't say anything about whether section 306 is applicable. In fact --"

That prefatory clause that the Chief Justice was asking about doesn't say anything about whether section 306 applies. 306 does not have a prefatory clause like that, which strongly suggests that it's not intended to apply there. In other --"

Yes, if -- if there is an effluent limitation for a particular source -- remember, effluent limitations are adopted for industrial sources, so you would have to look at what the source of that discharge was. And if EPA had identified that source, a particular kind of factory of some kind, a mill, you know, a leather tanning facility or something like that, if EPA had adopted effluent limitations that were applicable to that source, then discharges have to comply with those effluent limitations. It's important to realize here that the Clean Water Act, contrary to the way the Petitioners try to present it, is not just one big permitting statute. It's not simply 402 and 404 and that determines everything. The effluent limitations under sections 301 and 306 have independent applicability directly to discharges. They are separately enforceable by EPA and through citizens."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

    "speech": "By weight. By volume it is 30 percent solids."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

    "speaker": "WALDO",

  {
    "speaker": "WALDO",
    "speech": "There might be some point at which the liquid content of a solid waste is so small that EPA wouldn't regard it as processed wastewater anymore. But that's not the case here. In this case, there is no dispute that the discharge is processed wastewater. The government has conceded that point. And -- and it's extremely important, because EPA is required to, as I said, regulate suspended solids through effluent limitations and to adopt a zero --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "So if they were just putting whatever it is that doesn't have any water, concrete, into this lake, then you agree that it would be just the Corps of Engineers through the fill -- fill provisions that would govern that?"

    "speech": "As long as there is no effluent limitation governing it, yes."
  },

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "I guess I'm just curious how that makes any sense, since we are talking about putting something into water. I mean, does it really matter whether you add the water before it goes into the lake or just the lake adds the water when you put in the solid?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERT",
    "speech": "Either way, I guess your friends on the other side would argue, I assume, that it's properly regarded as fill material, because that is the effect of it, rather than as effluent subject to 402."
  },

    "speaker": "WALDO",
    "speech": "EPA has always regulated industrial sources that -- whose raw processed wastewater contains high levels of suspended solids, high enough that it would have the effect of fill material and can be considered fill. In fact -- and, in fact, EPA has always had a definition of fill material that was based on the effects. So for more than 30 years, EPA has been regulating sources like ore processing mills, cement manufacturing plants, aluminum smelters, coal-fired power plants, all of which and many more require the use of settling ponds to remove the solids."

    "speaker": "KENNEDY",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALDO",
    "speech": "No. In this case there can't be any permit because there is a new source performance standard that prohibits --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "All right. So, let's change that. What if the -- what if the new source performance standard was not a total prohibition? What if there was an effluent limitation in there, so that a permit could be issued, provided that there was compliance with the effluent limitation? Now, who issues the permit? And I repeat, I understand it's your position that there can't be both a 402 and a 404 permit."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALDO",
    "speech": "If there is an effluent limitation applicable, it will end up having to be EPA that issues the permit, and that's -- that's simply because the Corps of Engineers just doesn't have the tools available to apply effluent limitations in its 404 permits, except for toxic substances."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALDO",
    "speech": "Oh, I see what you are saying. Yeah. Well, even -- the -- what the problem is is that section 404 doesn't make any provision for application of effluent limitations and performance standards under sections 301 and 306."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "And 402 doesn't make any application for -- for the 404 regulations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALDO",
    "speech": "Yeah, that's correct. But it does provide the tool for EPA to apply those effluent limitations that you were asking about. The effluent limitations have to be complied with, and EPA is the agency under section --"

    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "Where does it make the -- where does it make provision for application of the standards that should apply to fill under 404?"

    "speaker": "WALDO",
    "speech": "Where does it say -- I'm sorry. Could you clarify the question?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "Where does it say that? You say that there can't be two permits and you say 402 trumps 404. And I'm asking where in the statute does it say that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALDO",
    "speech": "It is an absence of a provision in 404, but -- but the thing is, even if 404 has -- even if the Corps of Engineers -- and I should say, we agree with the Government and with the agencies about this. The agencies have never interpreted section 404 to provide for the application of effluent limitations in 404 permits. The 404(b) guidelines don't provide for it; it's not provided in the statute. And so, they just don't have the ability to do it. The problem is, they try to carry that a step farther and take that absence of provision to say that it's an exception from effluent limitations, to say that they don't have to comply with section 301 and 306, but it doesn't say that; and that's an implied exception, and the Court should only find an implied exception if it's necessary to avoid absurd results."

  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "Excuse me. Could you go back for a second to my discussion with Mr. Olson? I'm thinking of it in very simplified terms. The simplified terms is, I think of a pipe and I think of a circumstance where some terrible pollutant comes out of the pipe that would be subject to 306; and if the pipe goes up in a river or a lake, a regular lake, it could fill up the bottom. Seems possible."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALDO",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },

    "speech": "It doesn't even have to fill it up very much --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "Yes, I know, I know that. I see the point.  But I mean, it seems to me if it fills up to the bottom to whatever point, it's fill, and now it's the Army Corps of Engineers. If it has effluent in it, it's effluent and so now it's under EPA. In other words, you have both."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "Now, I heard from -- and I might interpret Mr. Olson -- he may not have really said this, but the way I heard it was: Well, don't worry, because if it's fill and you get it over to the Corps of Engineers, they are going to apply the effluent standard anyway. And now you are sort of saying: Well, or they are going to apply some standard. And then there was a question of well, what standard, and we got a little vague there. Now, what happens if it goes to the EPA as effluent? Justice Alito's question is, well, do they apply the fill standard? And between my response to these two answers, I still don't understand how it works. It's -- help me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALDO",
    "speech": "The Corps of Engineers only applies toxic effluent limitations. There are other pollutants that are nontoxic --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "Okay. So now, if you lose this case, what we are going to have is all the fish are going to be killed by some horrible pollutant, and the -- the Army Corps of Engineers can't do anything about it, and the only reason is we put enough of the pollutant in there to fill it up to ten feet from the bottom. And then if you did it the other way, if the EPA regulated it, it might do something terrible under 404, and they couldn't do anything about it. Now it's very hard for me to believe that that's really how these agencies have been operating for 40 years."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALDO",
    "speech": "Well, that's not; and let me explain how they have been operating, because I think that will help clarify it. For 40 years EPA has regulated sources like ore processing mills, aluminum smelters, others that I have named, others that are listed in our brief, and has applied effluent limitations to those discharges. Now, you hear --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Even when they -- even fill -- even when they fill a lake?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALDO",
    "speech": "Yes, absolutely -- and let me explain that, because you hear this statement a lot: \"EPA never regulates fill material.\" Well, that's because when you apply the effluent limitations, it's not fill material anymore. The effluent limitations require the use of settling ponds that are not in navigable waters. The settling ponds or other technologies remove almost all of the solids so that the discharge that is permitted by EPA in the section 402 permit might have a limitation of 20 or 30 milligrams per liter, something that wouldn't have a measurable filling effect on the receiving water body."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "So when EPA regulates has regulated these for 40 years, which I assume is up until 2002, then it's -- it's because they don't go into lakes; it's because they go into settling ponds?"

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "So the new regulation says the EPA does not regulate it when it goes into -- I can understand why the Army Corps of Engineers doesn't care if it's an impoundment pond or a settling pond, but they do care when it's a lake."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALDO",
    "speech": "When they adopted the new regulation, they were very clear that they intended to continue their past practice. The agencies never stated an intent to repeal or modify or change the applicability of any effluent limitations, and in fact this question came up repeatedly: What happens if it's fill material but it's subject to an effluent limitation; and every time they addressed it, they said the same thing. Effluent limitations will continue to apply and will be applied through section 402 permits."

In the other organism they had, it -- the organism survived, but their reproduction rate was significantly reduced, also meeting the toxicity test standards that EPA establishes. So this --"

    "speaker": "WALDO",
    "speech": "They took that slurry, they let the solids settle down in the bottom, and then they tested the solids for what effect it would have on some fresh water organisms, because they were trying to determine whether the lake would be able to recover from depositing all these solids into the lake. And they found that it had a very high toxicity level. And so what they did to try to remedy that was require depositing native vegetation on the top of all of that, after the mine closes. And they are hoping that that will have the effect of letting the lake recover. But EPA concluded that it will take decades, if ever, before the lake can recover from that. So this is not some benign wet-sand kind of discharge. It's a toxic slurry with a high pH level and with effects that are going to last for decades. And if EPA -- if section 404 is interpreted to allow these kinds of discharges to be emitted exempt from effluent limitations, it eviscerates key requirements of the Clean Water Act. EPA is required to regulate sources of this type through effluent limitations. EPA is required to regulate the suspended solids through effluent limitations from industrial sources like this. So --"
