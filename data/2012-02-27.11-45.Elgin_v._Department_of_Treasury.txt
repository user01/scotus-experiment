3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:03 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 11-45, Elgin v. Department of 5 the Treasury. 6 Mr. Schwartz. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY A. SCHWARTZ 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. SCHWARTZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 The question in this case is whether it is 12 fairly discernible from the Civil Service Reform Act 13 that Congress revoked the district court jurisdiction to 14 declare acts of Congress unconstitutional in actions 15 brought by Federal employees. The answer is no, for 16 several reasons. 17 First, the Civil Service Reform Act doesn't 18 say that it precludes section 1331 jurisdiction. 19 Congress could have said so. Congress didn't say so. 20 And there's no inference of preclusion of the 21 Petitioners' claims that's fairly discernible from the 22 scheme itself. And that's because challenges to 23 constitutionality of statutes are just not the type of 24 claims that are reviewed through the CSRA scheme. 25 Because of this, the Merit Systems

2 constitutionality of a statute routinely as outside of

3 its authority.

4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Schwartz --

5 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.

6 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- suppose an employee is

7 fired and he has a variety of different kinds of claims,

8 constitutional and statutory. What would you think

9 happens then? Does he bring the constitutional claims

10 in one court but the statutory claims in another

11 court -- excuse me -- in the -- in the commission?

12 MR. SCHWARTZ: No, Your Honor. I believe

13 that, because of normal rules against splitting of

14 claims, the employee would have to make a decision.

15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that seems just as

16 bad. In other words, that then, you -- it's not

17 inefficient necessarily, but your scheme would force the

18 employee to choose between her constitutional claims and

19 her statutory claims.

20 MR. SCHWARTZ: That is correct.

21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Why would we do that?

22 MR. SCHWARTZ: Because of the importance of

23 making the constitutional claims available in -- in a --

24 for judicial review. That is -- that's just one of the

25 options that the employee would have to weigh.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
5 1 JUSTICE ALITO: Why would you make 2 that concession? Why wouldn't it be possible in that -3 for an employee to choose? If the employee had both 4 constitutional and nonconstitutional claims, perhaps 5 that employee could take advantage of the review scheme 6 that's outlined by the Government. But in the situation 7 where there's purely a challenge to a statute, the 8 employee would have the option of bringing the claim in 9 one of the district courts. 10 MR. SCHWARTZ: That -- that certainly is a 11 possibility, Your Honor. And -- and it is a possibility 12 that the employee could bring his constitutional claim 13 in the district court and still pursue his statutory 14 claim before the Merit Systems Protection Board. 15 However, I'd like to point out that, while this is an 16 interesting hypothetical, we don't have to look at 17 hypotheticals in this situation because we have in the 18 Third Circuit since 1986 and in the District of Columbia 19 Circuit since 1995 -- those two circuits permit Federal 20 employees to bring their constitutional claims in the 21 circuit court. 22 We were unable to find a single instance in 23 which there has been one of these mixed claims of a -- a 24 constitutional claim and a statutory claim brought in 25 those circuits.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
6 1 JUSTICE SCALIA: In -- in those cases, did 2 the -- did the plaintiffs also have nonconstitutional 3 claims which they were pursuing in the Federal Circuit? 4 MR. SCHWARTZ: We -- we were unable to -- to 5 find any example of -- of that happening. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, that's -- that's 7 the problem here. I mean, yes, if all you have is a 8 constitutional claim, I suppose the system you propose 9 would work. You go to the district court. But where -10 where you have both, it's a problem. 11 MR. SCHWARTZ: I -- and I -- I agree that 12 that is a more difficult situation. But it's not the 13 situation presented by the facts of this case at least. 14 JUSTICE KAGAN: You suggested that it's a 15 situation that doesn't often arise, and I guess that 16 puzzles me. Why wouldn't it often arise? 17 MR. SCHWARTZ: I don't know why it doesn't 18 often arise. It -- it might be that -- that people 19 prefer to leave their claims in the Merit Systems 20 Protection Board. And -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you -23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what would happen if -24 if the employee is fired because of his or her religion 25 and he goes to MSPB?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.

7

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And this is a First

3 Amendment claim. MSPB has to say, well, this is not

4 adequate cause, and -- and then they find something else

5 in the statute? It can't look at the constitutional

6 aspect of the claim?

7 MR. SCHWARTZ: Your Honor, if -- if an

8 employee is fired because of his religion, there's --

9 there's a -- a separate procedure for discrimination

10 claims such as could be brought under Title VII -- and,

11 in fact, those claims do go directly to the district

12 court.

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, because -- well,

14 let's -- then I have to do a new hypothetical.

15 (Laughter.)

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because he gave a -- a

17 speech --

18 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- saying there's no

20 global warming or something.

21 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. That claim now could be

22 brought before the Merit Systems Protection Board, and I

23 agree that -- that it can be brought before the Merit

24 Systems Protection Board, and I'm not urging this Court

25 to say that that --

Alderson Reporting Company

8 1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the MSPB says we can't 2 look at the First Amendment? 3 MR. SCHWARTZ: No. No. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you -- you're 5 talking -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, just to 7 clarify: No, they wouldn't say that? Or -- I'm -- I 8 lost this, which way your "no" was going. 9 MR. SCHWARTZ: Okay. I'll -- I'll retract 10 my "no" then. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schwartz, I thought 12 you're talking about the constitutionality of a statute. 13 MR. SCHWARTZ: That's it exactly, Your 14 Honor. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not any constitutional 16 claim that there has been unconstitutional action by an 17 official. I thought that your point was when you're 18 challenging the constitutionality of a statute, then you 19 have a right to go to the district court. 20 MR. SCHWARTZ: That is my point exactly, 21 Your Honor. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But could I -23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What I'm asking -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I please 25 verify your answer to Justice Kennedy before you move

Official

9

2 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. I am drawing a

3 distinction between a challenge to the constitutionality

4 of a statute, as the Petitioners are doing here, and

5 that is beyond the -- the authority of the Merit

6 Systems --

7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you talking about a

8 facial challenge to the statute as -- and am I

9 understanding you right? A facial challenge goes to the

10 district court and a constitutional as-applied challenge

11 goes to the commission?

12 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. And -- and that --

13 that's the procedure. The as-applied challenge -- those

14 cases are bread-and-butter cases at the Merit Systems

15 Protection Board now. If somebody says I was fired

16 because I wrote a letter to the editor that my boss

17 didn't like, he's not challenging the constitutional --

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- I was leading up

19 to the fact, why should there be a difference? If the

20 MSPB has this expertise in as-applied, why doesn't it

21 have it for facial? I mean, the expertise question

22 is -- it can't be a matter of expertise; or am I wrong

23 about that?

24 MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, I would -- with due

25 respect, I -- I disagree with you, Your Honor. The

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 expertise required to decide the present Petitioners'

10

2 claim and the letter to the editor claim is totally

3 different. In the letter to the editor claim, the facts

4 concern the facts of the workplace, what was my boss's

5 motivation, what were his actual reasons for firing me.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and whether that

7 reason was justifiable. And isn't it the case that

8 whenever the reason is an unconstitutional reason, you

9 would have an as-applied challenge, right?

10 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, why do you need a

12 facial challenge in addition? I thought that we always

13 try to do as-applied first and facial second. So, why

14 isn't it enough that you can go to the Merit Systems

15 Protection Board and then to the Federal Circuit saying

16 that this action was wrong and not allowed under the

17 statute? And -- and if -- if the reason it was wrong

18 was that it was unconstitutional, what's -- what's the

19 problem?

20 MR. SCHWARTZ: Justice Scalia, I -- I agree

21 that in the as-applied challenge where somebody says my

22 rights were violated, that case now goes and should go

23 to the Merit Systems Protection Board. In the present

24 case, there's no challenge to the application of a

25 statute. There's no challenge to any decision that was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 made by -- by managers. The challenge is to the

11

2 decision made by Congress --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, that is the

4 rule --

5 MR. SCHWARTZ: -- in enacting the Civil --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the rule that

7 you would apply across the board so long -- only in the

8 case of a facial challenge do you get to go to the

9 district court? If it's an as-applied -- this law was

10 unconstitutional as applied to me -- that's still before

11 the MSPB?

12 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. And -- and --

13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me how --

14 MR. SCHWARTZ: And --

15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- how -- how this is

16 any different than the administrative system and review

17 system that was reviewed in Thunder Basin and Illinois

18 Long-Term Care? In both those statutes, the agencies

19 weren't permitted to consider facial challenges,

20 constitutional challenges; and we said that's okay, they

21 can't, but the reviewing court can. So, how's that any

22 different from the situation you're proposing here?

23 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. There are several

24 significant differences. I'd like to -- I'd like to go

25 through them.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
12 1 First of all, in the Thunder Basin case, 2 the -- the constitutional challenge was -- was to the 3 procedures that were being applied. The agency, the 4 Mine Safety Commission, was -- was an expert in those 5 procedures. The facts that were involved in making that 6 determination were the very facts that this Mine Safety 7 Commission had expertise in. 8 In the present case, the challenge is to the 9 Selective Service laws. The Merit Systems Protection 10 Board -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But please deal with the 12 language of both cases. Both cases said even if the 13 agency can't review a constitutional challenge, there's 14 still review within the Federal Circuit -- within the -15 within the circuit courts, and that's okay. 16 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why isn't that okay 18 here? I think that was Justice Scalia's question to 19 you. I know that you say, well, the Federal Circuit 20 won't have a record. But the Government says if it 21 wants a record, it can remand and ask the agency to 22 develop it. So, what's wrong with that procedure? 23 MR. SCHWARTZ: The first thing that's 24 wrong -- that's wrong with that procedure as it would be 25 applied to this case is that it's -- it's a vast
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
13 1 departure from the Civil Service Reform Act scheme as it 2 was created by Congress; and -- and -- because that 3 scheme involves the Merit Systems Protection Board 4 acting as a trial court; and -- and giving the first 5 level of review and in effect substituting for the -6 for a district court. And then -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't one of the 8 challenges here by one of the Petitioners that he was 9 constructively discharged? Isn't that an issue that the 10 board is better suited to determine in the first 11 instance, whether there was at all a constructive 12 discharge? 13 MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, in fact, it's -- it's 14 just the reverse of that, where that one Petitioner 15 would be taking the position that he was not 16 constructively discharged. If he was constructively 17 discharged, the Merit Systems Protection Board arguably 18 would have jurisdiction. If he voluntarily resigned, 19 under the Government's theory, he would be among the 20 class of Federal employees -- constitutes about a third 21 of Federal employees -- who have no appellate rights to 22 the Merit Systems Protection Board. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your position 24 was that the Merit Systems Protection Board has said we 25 have no authority to adjudicate constitutional
Alderson Reporting Company

1 questions, period.

Official

14

2 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, I thought that the

4 court was saying this claim is dismissed because we

5 don't have jurisdiction to deal with that kind of

6 question. And then your next -- the Federal Circuit --

7 well, how can the Federal Circuit exercise jurisdiction

8 over a claim where the first-instance decisionmaker said

9 it didn't have authority to render the decision?

10 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that that's

12 what your position was.

13 MR. SCHWARTZ: That is what our position is,

14 and -- and it leaves open the question of just what the

15 Federal Circuit is going to do after the Merit Systems

16 Protection Board has dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's not your

18 position, as I understood it, in your response to my

19 earlier question. You said that the -- it is all right

20 to have as-applied constitutional challenges presented

21 to the MSPB or not presented but then reviewed in the

22 Federal Circuit.

23 MR. SCHWARTZ: My position is that if the

24 MSPB has jurisdiction to find a statute -- that since

25 the MSPB does not have jurisdiction to find a statute

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 unconstitutional, any claim in which the employee is

15

2 asking for them to find a statute unconstitutional is

3 one that is outside of the CSRA scheme.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, but -- but

5 within the statutory scheme, are you saying that a claim

6 that this statute is, while not facially

7 unconstitutional, unconstitutional as applied to me --

8 Where does that go?

9 MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

10 apologize for my confusion about --

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think it's

12 probably mine.

13 MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, I would defer to you,

14 Your Honor.

15 (Laughter.)

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where does -- where

17 does -- where does that claim go?

18 MR. SCHWARTZ: My confusion is about the use

19 of the term "as applied." And I -- rather than using

20 terms such as "facial" or "as applied" where the

21 dividing line can be somewhat blurry, I propose drawing

22 the dividing line between a case where the employee is

23 saying this statute is unconstitutional; I'm saying

24 Congress made a mistake --

25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why wouldn't the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
16 1 dividing line be -- and I think that this is consistent 2 with your argument. The dividing line should be where 3 the MSPB itself could decide the claim. 4 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. 5 JUSTICE KAGAN: If the MSPB can decide the 6 claim, then it goes to the MSPB. If the MSPB can't 7 decide the claim, I think is what you're saying, then 8 it has to go to the district court. 9 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. 10 JUSTICE KAGAN: And you're saying that the 11 MSPB has said that, although it can decide, can decide, 12 cases where he says, you know, my -- my supervisor fired 13 me for a discriminatory reason, that that's within the 14 scope of the MSPB's authority, a claim like this, which 15 is that the Selective Service Act is unconstitutional 16 full stop, is not within the scope of the MSPB's 17 authority. Is that right? 18 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes, that's absolutely 19 correct. And -- and the cases that would not be within 20 the MSPB's authority would include cases where the 21 employee says the statute is unconstitutional and would 22 also include the million or so Federal employees who, as 23 the Government says, have no appellate rights to the 24 MSPB, all -- all of those persons, career -- those 25 persons would include summer interns, FBI employees.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
17 1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, what type -2 summer interns and FBI employees? 3 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. The -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I assume that's for 5 very different reasons -- one because they are summer 6 interns, and, you know, if they are impermissibly 7 treated, it's kind of -- they're summer interns. 8 There's no reason to get -9 (Laughter.) 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't -- I 11 don't mean that facetiously. I mean, what they're 12 saying is that there's some level of de minimis 13 personnel actions when you're talking about the vast 14 Federal bureaucracy that we don't have to really give, 15 you know, the whole panoply of rights. And FBI agents, 16 I assume, because it's the sensitive nature of what they 17 deal with. 18 So, I guess what I'm saying is, do you want 19 us to focus on the millions of employees who would now 20 be going to district court or do you want us to focus on 21 the small number that have facial constitutional 22 challenges? 23 MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, actually, Your Honor, 24 it's the Government that is taking the position that the 25 summer interns, the FBI agents, all the government
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 attorneys, Federal Government chaplains, who have no

18

2 right to appeal to the MSPB -- all of those persons, the

3 Government says. Can bring their constitutional claims

4 to the district court.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: And why is that wrong? It

6 seems to me that's what the -- what the Administrative

7 Procedure Act says, that if there is no other effective

8 means of judicial review, you get judicial review under

9 the APA.

10 MR. SCHWARTZ: Well --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: These people have no

12 effective right because they can't go to the MSPB and

13 can't go to the Federal Circuit. So, they have -- they

14 have rights in the district court. That's not a

15 problem.

16 The problem is the people who do have rights

17 to go to the Merit Systems Protection Board, right, who

18 have constitutional claims based on -- on the

19 unconstitutionality of a statute?

20 MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, I -- I disagree with

21 that, Justice Scalia.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why?

23 MR. SCHWARTZ: Because the -- the summer

24 intern, the FBI agent, the nonpreference employee, the

25 excepted service employees, unless they -- they have a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
19 1 claim that they can take to the Merit Systems Protection 2 Board, they're precluded from going to any other court. 3 They're precluded under the Administrative Procedures 4 Act. That's this Court's Fausto decision. And in this 5 Court's Fausto decision, a Federal employee who could 6 not bring a case -- his appeal to the Merit Systems 7 Protection Board tried to bring a Back Pay Act claim in 8 the Court of Claims and this court said, no, that is 9 precluded. 10 And what the Government is doing is saying 11 you got a right in Fausto, but for constitutional 12 claims, Mr. Fausto had it right. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that's -- that's 14 entirely logical. Fausto in effect said that the 15 statutory structure simply provides no cause of action 16 for these people, okay? 17 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: They're not entitled to 19 anything. But I don't think that there's anything in 20 the -- in the civil service laws that say these people 21 are not entitled to constitutional protections. So, I 22 don't think that -- that Fausto rules this out. 23 MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, and I -- I agree with you 24 completely that -- that constitutional claims are 25 different from statutory claims --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.

20

2 MR. SCHWARTZ: -- or damages.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it's those that I say

4 that people not covered by appeals to the Merit Systems

5 Protection Board -- they can bring those constitutional

6 claims, even though they can't bring statutory claims.

7 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. And that's -- that's

8 the position I'm taking. I'm taking it a step beyond

9 the Government, however.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. You're taking -- I'm

11 saying that's true only with respect to those people who

12 have no right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection

13 Board. You're going further.

14 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're saying even the

16 people who can appeal to the Merit Systems Protection

17 Board, right, can go directly to the district court?

18 That's a different question.

19 MR. SCHWARTZ: But I -- I'm limiting that to

20 those people who can appeal to the Merit Systems

21 Protection Board, but the Merit Systems Protection Board

22 has no authority to grant them relief.

23 JUSTICE ALITO: There are at least -- at

24 least three different kinds of constitutional claims,

25 and I'm not sure where you're drawing the line with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
21 1 respect to your argument. There's a claim that -- that 2 the agency acted in an unconstitutional manner, not that 3 any statute is unconstitutional -4 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: -- but there's 6 unconstitutional executive action. There's an as7 applied claim. Let's say that a plaintiff says that the 8 registration requirement is unconstitutional as applied 9 to me, not to other people, but to me because I'm a 10 conscientious objector or I have religious objections to 11 military action that the United States is taking at this 12 particular time. And then there's this -- there's a 13 claim that this statute is unconstitutional on its face. 14 Now, where do you -- which of those can the 15 Merit Systems Protection Review Board decide? Just the 16 first category? 17 MR. SCHWARTZ: Just the first category. 18 JUSTICE ALITO: So, it's not a distinction 19 between as-applied and facial? 20 MR. SCHWARTZ: No. No, no. And that's -21 that's -- that's why -- that's why I'm specifically not 22 trying to say where the line is between as-applied and 23 facial. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your position 25 was that whatever the MSPB cannot hear, then you can go
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to the district court.

22

2 MR. SCHWARTZ: That is absolutely correct.

3 And --

4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Now, in your original briefs,

5 Mr. Schwartz, you suggested that if the MSPB can't hear

6 a claim, neither can the Federal Circuit. And as I

7 understood the Government's brief, the Government comes

8 back and said that's not the case. Even when the MSPB

9 can't hear a claim, the Federal Circuit could hear it.

10 Now, then there's a question of, if there's a necessity

11 for a record, how does the record get developed?

12 But do you now concede that the Federal

13 Circuit could hear the claim as a matter -- you know, on

14 the -- at the -- at the first level?

15 MR. SCHWARTZ: I agree that a system can be

16 proposed to get these claims to the Federal Circuit.

17 However, it's not the system of the -- that Congress

18 created in the Civil Service Reform Act. And the

19 significance of the contortions that have to be gone

20 through to get these claims to the Federal Circuit

21 demonstrates that it's not fairly discernible from the

22 Civil Service Reform Act as written by Congress that --

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you take the position

24 that the MSPB, having no jurisdiction and saying it has

25 no jurisdiction, it can't adjudicate this matter, well,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 then, a reviewing court has no jurisdiction to -- to

23

2 review? There's nothing to review because the MSPB said

3 we have no jurisdiction.

4 MR. SCHWARTZ: That's how it would work in

5 the real world. I mean, what is -- what is the Federal

6 Circuit supposed to do? It has an order from the MSPB

7 that says we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The

8 Federal Circuit -- and the Government doesn't say that

9 that is wrong. The Federal Circuit says we affirm your

10 dismissal, and now we'll move on to the merits. That --

11 it's possible we could have a system like that, but that

12 isn't the system of the Civil Service Reform Act, and

13 that's not the way that appellate courts normally

14 function.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it really a

16 question of jurisdiction of the MSPB?

17 MR. SCHWARTZ: Well --

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: "Jurisdiction" is a

19 word with many meanings.

20 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. And -- and -- and

21 there's a general rule with that -- there have been

22 exceptions to -- that administrative agencies do not

23 have authority to rule on constitutionality of statutes.

24 JUSTICE BREYER: So, what's the problem? He

25 says -- the employee says I was dismissed. MSPB says

Alderson Reporting Company

24 1 that's right, you were, and it's lawful. The employee 2 says but you didn't consider my argument that the 3 relevant statute was unconstitutional. MSPB says, no, 4 we can't. The Federal Circuit says but we can; so, make 5 your argument. What's the problem? And then I'll 6 decide it. And if they decide it's unconstitutional, 7 then the action of the MSPB is wrong. 8 MR. SCHWARTZ: That's a system that -- that 9 could come up. It's not the system of the Civil Service 10 Reform Act in -- because -11 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know -- I'm just 12 saying, is there any practical problem with that? 13 MR. SCHWARTZ: Oh, it presents immense 14 practical problems. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Which is? 16 MR. SCHWARTZ: Which is that the Merit 17 Systems Protection Board is not going to say we affirm 18 your dismissal or that -- it's not going to reach the 19 merits. It's going to -- it's going to get the 20 paperwork. The government is going to -21 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine, fine. What they say 22 is you have one argument here, that the statute that led 23 to your dismissal was unconstitutional. 24 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: We do not have jurisdiction

25 1 over that; therefore, we say you were rightly dismissed. 2 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, they appeal that, and 4 they say they're right that they didn't, but you do; so, 5 will you please decide that this statute is 6 unconstitutional? What's the problem? 7 MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, that's -- that's an 8 unusual form of -9 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah. It may be unusual. I 10 just want to know what's the problem. I'm not saying 11 there isn't one. I want to know what's the problem with 12 that. 13 MR. SCHWARTZ: Okay. The problem, if that 14 is the system that's going to be in place, is that it's 15 not quite that straightforward. It's -- at first, the 16 employee has to file his claim in the MSPB with 17 everybody knowing it's going to be dismissed. He then 18 appeals that dismissal to the Federal Circuit, which 19 affirms the dismissal, says, yes, MSPB has no 20 jurisdiction. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: No, it doesn't affirm the 22 dismissal. It says the dismissal was unconstitutional; 23 go reinstate him. 24 MR. SCHWARTZ: And then, in a case such as 25 this one, where -- the raison d'être of this challenge

1 to Rostker is that the facts have changed. There was

2 extensive factual discovery in Rostker. So --

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that your point was

4 and hasn't the Federal Circuit said that the MSPB has no

5 jurisdiction to decide we have no jurisdiction to

6 review.

7 MR. SCHWARTZ: That's what the Federal

8 Circuit had said.

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that an appellate

10 court is reviewing a court of first instance. The

11 scheme that has been proposed would turn the Federal

12 Circuit into a court of first instance, rather than an

13 appellate court.

14 MR. SCHWARTZ: And that is why what's

15 proposed by the Government is such a departure from the

16 CSRA scheme as written by Congress, in which MSPB has

17 first-instance jurisdiction; the Federal Circuit has

18 appellate jurisdiction.

19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, isn't your basic

20 answer to Justice Breyer -- I mean, correct me if I'm

21 wrong -- you think that the problem is that there's no

22 record that the Federal Circuit can use to evaluate this

23 constitutional claim?

24 MR. SCHWARTZ: That is correct.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, every day of the week

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 we get constitutional claims, and people submit all

27

2 their arguments in the briefs. Now, occasionally,

3 there's one you have to have factual development, and I

4 grant you on that one maybe they could appoint a special

5 master or, if not, send it back. But they have plenty

6 of authority to get them to argue the facts. But I

7 doubt -- I don't know if there are such claims. But I

8 don't see why that would be a problem. Now, I'm not --

9 again, I'm not giving you an answer. I'm giving you a

10 question.

11 MR. SCHWARTZ: The problem is that that's

12 not the scheme written by Congress --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: That's your conclusion, and

14 I want to know what -- what is the practical reason that

15 that wouldn't work or why is that such a big problem to

16 have it work that way? I'm asking for your answer on

17 that.

18 MR. SCHWARTZ: Okay. I mean, that's -- that

19 system could work in some cases. I agree with that.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: Give me one where it

21 wouldn't.

22 MR. SCHWARTZ: Excuse me?

2 JUSTICE BREYER: So, you have to be thinking

3 about it if you want to respond.

4 MR. SCHWARTZ: Okay.

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you said this

6 one.

7 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This one, because you

9 want to make a record of all the changes that have

10 occurred in the service, and you need much more than

11 briefs. You need to have maybe testimony from people

12 who have -- who have been working with the changes in

23 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN

24 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

25 MR. FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 and may it please the Court:

29

2 I'd like to begin if I could by addressing the

3 question asked by Justice Kagan, which is why shouldn't

4 the scope of the MSPB's authority be the test for

5 determining whether a claim can be filed in district

6 court?

7 And I think using that as the test would

8 lead to unclear and easily manipulated jurisdictional

9 rules. Among other things, it often won't be clear up

10 front whether the MSPB can resolve an employee's claim

11 or not. A claim that appears at first blush to

12 challenge a statute's constitutionality might be

13 resolved, for instance, by interpreting the statute to

14 avoid the constitutional question, which is something

15 that the MSPB could do.

16 JUSTICE KAGAN: We could just ask the

17 MSPB, Mr. Feigin. If you bring the claim to the MSPB,

18 and then the MSPB says, no, we have no authority to

19 adjudicate this claim, then you know that you're in a

20 world in which the MSPB doesn't have authority, so that

21 you can go to the district court.

22 MR. FEIGIN: Well, I don't think that's

23 consistent with the CSRA, Your Honor, because the way

24 the CSRA works is that you go to the MSPB first, and

25 then you go to the Federal Circuit. And I think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 everyone agrees that the Federal --

30

2 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but the CSRA is

3 presuming that the MSPB actually can decide something.

4 MR. FEIGIN: I don't think it's presuming

5 that any more than 42 U.S.C. 405(g) was presuming that

6 in Illinois Council or the Mine Act was presuming that

7 in Thunder Basin Coal. That is, that it's often useful

8 to have constitutional claims presented to an agency in

9 the first instance, even if the agency can't resolve

10 those claims, because it allows the agency to figure

11 out -- for example, in the case that this Court was

12 discussing with Mr. Schwartz about circumstances where

13 there might be nonconstitutional claims and

14 constitutional claims, the agency might be able to moot

15 out the case on nonconstitutional grounds. The

16 constitutional --

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feigin, those --

18 those statutes to which you refer said that no action on

19 the claim -- well, this was Social Security benefits --

20 no action shall be brought under 1331. There is no such

21 provision here.

22 MR. FEIGIN: That was true in Illinois

23 Council and some of the other cases we cite. But in --

24 in Thunder Basin, the Court was very clear that the

25 statute was facially silent as to the preclusion of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
31 1 pre-enforcement claims like the sort that were at issue 2 in Thunder Basin. The Court nevertheless held that the 3 claim in Thunder Basin was precluded, and it held that 4 even though it acknowledged that it might be possible 5 that the constitutional claim that was raised by the 6 plaintiff in that case couldn't be addressed in first 7 instance by the Mine Commission. 8 Now, the MSPB here is very analogous to the 9 Mine Commission. 10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, could you help me with 11 something? Because I agree with you, Thunder Basin is a 12 very strong case for you, but McNary is a very strong 13 case for Mr. Schwartz. And I read those two opinions, 14 and, frankly, I have a tough time reconciling them. So, 15 could you tell me how you do? 16 MR. FEIGIN: We prefer Thunder Basin, Your 17 Honor. 18 (Laughter.) 19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, I imagine so. 20 MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, I think, as we 21 suggest in our brief, McNary actually presented a very 22 specialized circumstance in several respects. First of 23 all, there was a special statutory provision in that 24 case that limited judicial review of -- in that case, to 25 the record that had already been developed, and that's
Alderson Reporting Company

1 not true here.

Official

32

2 Second, the Court was very concerned in

3 McNary that if the plaintiffs weren't allowed to bring

4 their claims in district court, they wouldn't be able to

5 receive any meaningful judicial review at all.

6 Now, here, the plaintiffs in this case can

7 get meaningful judicial review from the Federal Circuit,

8 which everyone agrees has the authority to resolve a

9 constitutional challenge to a statute.

10 Now, if I could, I'd like to address I think

11 some confusion, as the Chief Justice was noting, over

12 the meaning of the term "jurisdiction" and exactly what

13 would happen if the Petitioners had brought this case in

14 the first instance to the MSPB.

15 Now, before getting into this, I'd like to

16 acknowledge that when Petitioner Elgin did bring this

17 case to the MSPB, the government argued that the MSPB

18 had no jurisdiction. We have conceded below and we

19 concede here that we were wrong about that. We do not

20 think Elgin should be prejudiced by the government's

21 position. If he were to file a motion now to reopen his

22 case with the MSPB, the Government would support that.

23 Here's how it should have worked if the

24 government --

25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that your -- is that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
33 1 your answer for that's why it's an out for their failure 2 to have gone to the Federal Circuit? 3 MR. FEIGIN: Our answer -- our answer -4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Will they be able -- if 5 the -- if the commission says, no, we won't reopen, do 6 they have any avenue now to go to the Federal Circuit? 7 MR. FEIGIN: Well, they can appeal that 8 decision to the Federal Circuit, and the Government will 9 again support the fact that the case ought to be 10 reopened. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please finish with your 12 answer. 13 MR. FEIGIN: And let me now address what 14 should have happened when the case went to the MSPB. 15 The MSPB would have had jurisdiction over the case in 16 the sense that the challenge to the adverse action is 17 properly before the MSPB. I think that's very clear 18 under 5 U.S.C. 7513(d) and 5 U.S.C. 7701(a), which grant 19 the MSPB jurisdiction over adverse actions under the 20 CSRA. 21 Now, the MSPB would not be able to 22 adjudicate the constitutionality, would not be able to 23 issue an order striking down a Federal statute. And to 24 determine that that would be what would be necessary 25 here in order to grant the plaintiffs relief, what it
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
34 1 would have done is, first of all, it could have accepted 2 any evidence that the plaintiffs or the government 3 wished to submit on the constitutional issue in order to 4 build up the administrative record for review -5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I ask you to 6 pause -7 MR. FEIGIN: Yes. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- briefly on that 9 question? So, the government -- if Mr. Schwartz comes 10 in before the MSPB and says we have three witnesses who 11 are going to testify only on the constitutional issue; I 12 have this volume of evidence about what's happening in 13 the military; it's only relevant in the constitutional 14 issue; and, you know, it's going to take us 2 days to 15 present this -- the government is going to say it's okay 16 with us, right? 17 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're not going to 19 object that that's beyond the jurisdiction of the agency 20 to decide. 21 MR. FEIGIN: We will not object that it's 22 not beyond the jurisdiction of the agency to decide -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I will object. What 24 is the agency -- taking evidence on an issue that it has 25 no jurisdiction to decide? That is absolutely weird.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35

2 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think this

3 is fairly analogous, although not perfectly analogous,

4 to the fairly common circumstance where, for example, a

5 district court reserves to itself a decision on the

6 merits of an action and then delegates to a magistrate

7 judge decisions on discovery. Now, the only

8 limitation --

9 JUSTICE KAGAN: But they're very different

10 because the magistrate can come back to the district

11 court judge and say we have a tough one, Your Honor; why

12 don't you decide it?

13 I mean, here you're stipulating that the

14 board has no power to decide this question. Call it

15 jurisdiction; call it something else. The board cannot

16 decide the question, but the board is going to now

17 become the arbiter of discovery disputes? The

18 factfinder? I mean, "weird" is a good word for it.

19 MR. FEIGIN: Well, first of all, Your Honor,

20 the only thing that we think the MSPB lacks authority to

21 do, the only thing, is to issue an order on the merits

22 declaring a Federal statute unconstitutional. It is

23 competent to resolve discovery disputes --

24 JUSTICE ALITO: How can it -- how can it

25 deal with discovery without knowing -- without going

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
36 1 into the merits of the constitutional claim? In other 2 words, the parties can just put in any evidence they 3 want? 4 MR. FEIGIN: Well -5 JUSTICE ALITO: Any evidence they think 6 might be possibly be relevant to the case, they can put 7 that in. It can be discovery of anything. 8 MR. FEIGIN: Well, there may be disputes as 9 to the scope of discovery. And those -- resolution of 10 those disputes may touch on the merits. We think the 11 MSPB can do all of that. The only thing the MSPB lacks 12 authority to do, according to the MSPB, is to issue an 13 order striking down a Federal statute as 14 unconstitutional. 15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think the MSPB should 16 find facts with regard to this claim? 17 MR. FEIGIN: Well, first of all, Your Honor, 18 I think this case isn't going to require any factfinding 19 because I think it's worth noting that both judges that 20 have addressed Petitioners' arguments on the merits, the 21 district court judge and the concurring judge in the 22 court of appeals -23 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, maybe it will and 24 maybe it won't. 25 MR. FEIGIN: -- were able to resolve the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 claim without factfinding.

37

2 JUSTICE KAGAN: I would think, Mr. Feigin,

3 it would depend on how it's litigated. But in a case in

4 which there is some factfinding to be made, would the

5 MSPB have authority to find facts?

6 MR. FEIGIN: Yes, it would, Your Honor.

7 Now, I'd like to add that in many cases --

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you go back and tell

9 me when the government changed its position? It was my

10 understanding that up until, well, certainly this case

11 was litigated, the government was taking the position

12 MSPB has no jurisdiction to pass on the

13 constitutionality of a statute.

14 When did the government back away from that

15 position? When did it say, no, we were wrong; they do

16 have jurisdiction?

17 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I need to

18 separate out two things. First, it is still our

19 position that the MSPB has no authority to declare a

20 Federal statute unconstitutional. Now, the government

21 was taking the position that in cases where an employee

22 had been removed pursuant to a statutory bar, that the

23 MSPB lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal of -- of a

24 case like that.

25 And the reason the government argued was not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 because the MSPB lacked authority to decide the

38

2 constitutionality of a statute, although we believe

3 that, too, but because the government was arguing

4 erroneously that an employee who is removed based on a

5 statutory bar that should have prevented his hiring in

6 the first place wasn't an employee within the meaning of

7 5 U.S.C. 7511. Now the government no longer takes that

8 5 U.S.C. 7511 position. We've been consistent on that

9 in the court of appeals and in this Court, and,

10 therefore, we believe that the MSPB did properly have

11 jurisdiction over the action in this case.

12 Now, when it goes up to the MSPB, the MS --

13 and after -- the MSPB would then deny relief on the

14 merits because it would lack the authority to declare a

15 Federal statute unconstitutional.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't want to delay you;

17 so, don't pause too long. But I've just been curious --

18 where did this rule -- is there a statute or something

19 that says an agency can't say that this action would be

20 unconstitutional? Where does that idea come from?

21 MR. FEIGIN: So, there is not a statute,

22 Your Honor. This Court has said in several cases that

23 administrative agencies generally lack the authority to

24 declare a statute unconstitutional. It's clear from

25 Thunder Basin that that isn't a constitutional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
39 1 limitation on the authority of Federal agencies. That 2 is to say, if Congress wanted to give an agency the 3 authority to adjudicate the constitutionality of a 4 statute, it could. And the Court noted that the Mine 5 Commission in Thunder Basin believed it did have the 6 authority to adjudicate the constitutionality of 7 statutes, although the Court didn't reach whether the 8 Mine Commission was correct about that. 9 And in this case, the MSPB believes, 10 consistent with this Court's repeated statements, that 11 it lacks authority to adjudicate the constitutionality 12 of statutes. 13 Now, if the Court decides that the best way 14 to reconcile this scheme would simply be to say that the 15 MSPB does have the authority to adjudicate the 16 constitutionality of statutes, I think that would make 17 much more sense than the position the Petitioners are 18 urging. And here's an example, I think, that 19 illustrates why the position the Petitioners are urging 20 will lead to confusion of jurisdictional rules and 21 manipulation of jurisdictional rules. 22 So, if you imagine two employees who were 23 fired by an employing agency for leaking information to 24 the press, confidential information to the press, they 25 both challenge their removals, but they raise slightly
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
40 1 different arguments. The first one says, well, I don't 2 think the employment statute should be construed to 3 allow me to be fired for this reason because I think the 4 employment statute should be construed with First 5 Amendment principles in mind and shouldn't reach this 6 case. 7 The second one says I concede that the 8 employment statutes allow my firing for this reason, but 9 I think those -- I think that statute is 10 unconstitutional as applied. 11 Now, those are really the same claim and -12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Feigin, they might 13 well be the same claim, but if the MSPB can decide the 14 one and cannot decide the other, that's a relevant 15 distinction. Now, you might be right in what you said. 16 Well, maybe one answer is that the MSPB can decide both. 17 But as long as the MSPB can decide the one or the other, 18 it seems -- I mean, that's -- it seems like a sensible 19 dividing line. 20 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, even if the 21 MSPB lacks the authority to strike down a Federal 22 statute, I still think it might be able to adjudicate 23 the claim of the employee, the second employee, who 24 brings it as an as-applied challenge because the Court 25 would -- I'm sorry; not the Court -- the MSPB could
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
41 1 decide that case on the same constitutional avoidance 2 grounds that are -- that are urged by the first 3 employee. 4 That is, they really are the same case. 5 Before striking down a statute as constitutional, this 6 Court all the time, it instructs lower courts, and this 7 would be true of agencies, too, should interpret the 8 statute to avoid any significant constitutional 9 question. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: But they're not at all the 11 same claim. They're related, but one says the statute 12 means something; and insofar as it's applied to a 13 particular situation, it's unconstitutional. The other 14 one says it doesn't mean that. 15 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think they 16 are the same in the respect that, as I was just saying 17 to Justice Kagan, if the MSPB -18 JUSTICE ALITO: When we -- just let me rephrase 19 that. If -- if this Court adopts a certain 20 interpretation based on the principle of constitutional 21 avoidance, do you think the Court is rewriting the 22 statute? 23 MR. FEIGIN: No, Your Honor, but there may 24 be ambiguity in a statute that the Court interprets to 25 avoid a significant constitutional question. So, maybe
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
42 1 I can give another example that might flesh this out a 2 little bit. 3 There's a statute, 5 U.S.C. 7311, that bars 4 from Federal employment people who have participated in 5 strikes. Now, it's easy to think of an employee who 6 raises a factual or statutory challenge to that claim. 7 He says that what he did wasn't participating in a 8 strike, either factually or shouldn't be considered 9 participating in a strike within the scope of the 10 statute. And he also challenges the statute on 11 constitutional grounds. 12 And the most common case brought to the 13 MSPB, in our experience, that raises a constitutional 14 claim also raises the sort of factual and statutory 15 claims I was just suggesting. Now, the MSPB might 16 resolve that first question -- those first set of 17 questions in such a way as to avoid the constitutional 18 question by saying that the statute doesn't reach the 19 conduct that the particular employee engaged in. 20 And if we imagine instead that the employee 21 had only brought the constitutional claim, which would 22 be kind of a strange way to litigate because he'd be 23 giving up arguments on which he might win, I still think 24 that the MSPB could decide, look, before we send this 25 off to the Federal Circuit and decide that the only way
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
43 1 we can grant you relief is to say that a Federal statute 2 is unconstitutional, which is something we don't think 3 we can do, we should at least take a look at the statute 4 to see whether these somewhat ambiguous terms, 5 "participate" and "strike," actually do apply to your 6 conduct. 7 And by failing to give the MSPB the first 8 crack at doing that, what -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any such 10 possibility in this case? I mean, the statute says men 11 must register for the draft. There's no way to avoid -12 to reread that statute to say anything other than that. 13 So, I don't -- I don't see any constitutional avoidance. 14 MR. FEIGIN: I agree with that, Justice 15 Ginsburg. In this case, we don't think the 16 constitutional question can be avoided, and we don't 17 think the MSPB could have granted relief. But I don't 18 think the Court should essentially throw everything out 19 just because of this case. Their position is going to 20 make for unclear jurisdictional rules, and employees 21 aren't going to know where they're entitled to go or 22 where they're supposed to go, because -23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To go back to your 24 interesting suggestion that the board should decide the 25 constitutional issue, I've just been spending a little
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 bit of time going through the Act, and you're

44

2 certainly -- it doesn't appear that there's anything in

3 the Act that precludes them from granting any

4 appropriate relief with respect to an unlawful

5 discharge. Am I correct?

6 MR. FEIGIN: That's correct, Your Honor.

7 The statute does not, as we explain in our brief, draw

8 any distinction between the types of arguments that

9 would be made in seeking to set aside an unlawful

10 discharge --

11 JUSTICE KAGAN: Although, that's weird in

12 another way, isn't it, Mr. Feigin, because, can we

13 really imagine in the real world the MSPB deciding that

14 the Selective Service Act is unconstitutional? I mean,

15 what do they know about that question?

16 MR. FEIGIN: Well, as everyone agrees and as

17 Mr. Schwartz was discussing with the Court, the MSPB

18 does have expertise on -- in constitutional claims. The

19 MSPB are a set of -- a set of persons that are appointed

20 by the President and confirmed by the Senate.

21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but this is a

22 question, and -- and you can -- I take the point that

23 I'm just talking about this case. But this is a

24 question about whether women should have to register for

25 the draft in the same way as men should. That goes to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 defense policy. It goes to equal protection law. It 2 doesn't seem to have anything to do with -- with 3 workplace issues of the kind that the MSPB is expert on. 4 MR. FEIGIN: Well, I think that's right, 5 Justice Kagan, but the CSRA doesn't draw distinctions 6 between the types of arguments that are being made. It 7 draws distinctions, as Justice Sotomayor was just 8 suggesting, about what sorts of personnel actions it 9 covers. And I think -10 JUSTICE ALITO: Congress is -- Congress is 11 unhappy when this Court holds a statute 12 unconstitutional. 13 (Laughter.) 14 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think it's -- it's 15 really likely that they intended for the MS -- MSPRB to 16 have the authority to declare its acts unconstitutional? 17 MR. FEIGIN: I don't, Your Honor. And 18 that's why our primary position is that the MSPB does 19 not have that authority. However -20 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? I mean, it sounds -21 really what the argument boils down to is -- is if we 22 accept your position, there's a kind of procedural 23 complexity and anomaly. And your argument is that his 24 position's worse. And, yours is also fairly bad. 25 (Laughter.)
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1 JUSTICE BREYER: So, that's his point. So, 2 I mean, that's -- but that's why I wondered. I mean, 3 U.S. magistrates, all -- tax courts, all kinds of people 4 as a preliminary matter have jobs where they say we 5 think a statute is unconstitutional. I suppose 6 millions. I don't know how many. So, is this coming 7 that they can't do it from some kind of lore from 8 Kenneth Davis or something or -- what's -- what's the 9 basis of this? And wouldn't it be simpler if you just 10 said it says they can take appropriate relief? They can 11 take appropriate relief, period. End of the matter. 12 MR. FEIGIN: It's coming from statements by 13 this Court and also statements by Kenneth Davis -14 JUSTICE BREYER: Are there -15 MR. FEIGIN: -- in 1958 his administrative 16 law treatise. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: So, somebody quoted Kenneth 18 Davis in 1958 and wrote it into an opinion in a holding? 19 MR. FEIGIN: No. The Court usually just 20 sort of says this in passing. And the Court made very 21 clear -22 JUSTICE BREYER: So, Kenneth Davis said this 23 in 1958? 24 MR. FEIGIN: The Court made very clear in 25 Thunder Basin this is just a general presumption --

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

2 MR. FEIGIN: -- about the authority of

3 administrative agencies. It doesn't have to be --

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Johnson v. Robison is one

5 such case. I don't recall in that case anybody

6 referring to any administrative law treatise.

7 MR. FEIGIN: Well, that treatise is cited,

8 for example, by -- the Court cites the Mine Commission

9 cases that themselves cite the treatise. But the point

10 is, Justice Breyer, even if our rule does have a couple

11 of hiccups with it, we do think it is much superior to

12 the rule that Petitioners are urging because there are

13 clear jurisdictional rules.

14 If I could follow up --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I could just

16 focus there. In your brief, you're quite careful, and

17 you have been today, to talk to even if the MSPB lacked

18 this authority. It's your position that the MSPB does

19 lack this authority in fact; right? It's not just the

20 MSPB's position.

21 MR. FEIGIN: Yes, we agree with the MSPB's

22 position that it lacks the authority to strike down a

23 statute as constitutional. However, if it is a

24 difference between adopting Petitioners' position or

25 holding that the MSPB has the authority to declare a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
48 1 statute unconstitutional, we think Congress would have 2 greatly preferred the latter because that preserves 3 the -- the basic idea of the CSRA, which was to 4 consolidate and streamline judicial review. 5 As this Court recognized in Fausto, Congress 6 specifically did not want challenges to adverse actions 7 to go through district court into the court of appeals 8 and get a duplicative and wasteful two-layer judicial 9 review. Instead -10 JUSTICE ALITO: If anybody who drafted or 11 voted for the Civil Service Reform Act had thought about 12 a case like this, where it's a pure question of law, a 13 facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute, 14 do you think they would have said, well, the way we 15 think that this should be handled is this scheme that 16 you have proposed? 17 MR. FEIGIN: I think they would have 18 preferred it to a scheme where, first of all, the claims 19 go to district court, which is precisely what the CSRA 20 was trying to eliminate; and, second of all, to a scheme 21 where it becomes confusing and dependent on precisely 22 how a plaintiff frames his argument which court winds up 23 entertaining the claim. 24 Now -25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know of any
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 other -- any other case where an appellate court has

49

2 authority to decide a question that the court of first

3 instance lacked authority to decide? I mean, you say

4 MSPB says it has no authority, and you agree with that.

5 I couldn't think of another case where a

6 court of appeals, which is a court of review, not first

7 view, substitutes itself for an incompetent court of

8 first instance.

9 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, first of all,

10 we cite several examples of courts of appeals deciding

11 constitutional questions in the first instance, at pages

12 37 to 38 in our brief. Another example would be this

13 Court's decision in INS v. Chadha, the legislative veto

14 case, which came up from the Board of Immigration

15 Appeals. The Board of Immigration Appeals said it

16 didn't have authority to adjudicate the separation of

17 powers question. It was reviewed by the Ninth Circuit

18 and then reviewed by this Court.

19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Feigin, could I go back

20 to the Chief Justice's question about what actually

21 would happen in the MSPB? Presumably in this case, what

22 the plaintiffs seek to do is to develop an extensive

23 factual record showing how much has changed in the

24 military in terms of the -- the -- the role that women

25 play in the military. And that it's almost impossible

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to litigate this kind of claim without having such a

50

2 record. That's the entire basis for -- for arguing that

3 Rostker is outmoded, given current military operations.

4 So, how could the -- the plaintiff develop that record

5 that is needed to litigate this claim?

6 MR. FEIGIN: You would develop it in the

7 MSPB, either in the first instance on the initial

8 appeal, or the MSPB could let it go to the Federal

9 Circuit without having developed an administrative

10 record. And the Federal Circuit if, unlike either of

11 the judges to address the merits in this case, believed

12 that a factual record was necessary, it could remand to

13 the MSPB with instructions that the MSPB take evidence

14 and develop an administrative record.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't like that at all.

16 That's ridiculous. Send it back to an agency that has

17 no jurisdiction over the question, you know, make

18 factfindings on this -- on this question over which you

19 have no jurisdiction.

20 Can you give any example where -- where that

21 occurs elsewhere? Why wouldn't the -- the preferable

22 course be to appoint a master, have the Federal Circuit

23 appoint a master to do it?

24 MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, if the Court

25 believes that that is a better way to reconcile the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 scheme, we wouldn't oppose that either, but --

51

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I don't like

3 that.

4 (Laughter.)

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, the idea

6 of -- the special masters floating around freely every

7 time you get one of these cases -- I mean, what --

8 inevitably what's going to happen is that you're going

9 to have a more or less permanent special master who gets

10 all these things. You're not going to appoint 85

11 special masters if there are 85 of these sorts of

12 claims. It seems to me you've got an agency there

13 that's expert in the interrelation between the different

14 provisions in the statute. And, you know, why don't --

15 why don't -- they make factfindings all the time in

16 areas within their authority to decide. It seems to me

17 it's ready-made for sending these things back.

18 MR. FEIGIN: That was our position, Your

19 Honor --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but this is not

21 an area that's within their expertise to decide. What

22 do they know about -- about the military? And when is

23 that ever -- ever relevant to anything that they decide?

24 It's utterly irrelevant to their work. And you're

25 telling them to take --

Alderson Reporting Company

52 1 MR. FEIGIN: Well, first of all, Your Honor, 2 I think it's actually going to be a fairly rare case in 3 which a challenge to a legislative act of passing a 4 statute is really going to turn on some sort of factual 5 finding -- like a credibility -6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but this is that case. 7 MR. FEIGIN: -- like a credibility 8 determination or something that's uniquely within the 9 competence of a trial court or an agency with trial 10 court-like powers. 11 I think what might be more common, Justice 12 Kagan, is that you might need to develop some sort of 13 administrative record. But once the evidence is 14 submitted, the conclusions one would draw from that 15 evidence will be fairly obvious. For example, in 16 Rostker v. Goldberg, there was discovery, there was 17 evidence submitted, and then the parties were able to 18 stipulate to the facts that would set forth review. 19 So, in this case, for example, I don't think 20 there's really going to be a dispute that the MSPB is 21 going to have to resolve about what sorts of positions 22 women can serve in, in the military. I think the 23 government is going to be willing to stipulate to that. 24 JUSTICE ALITO: I suspect that if this were 25 litigated in district court, the government would move
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
53 1 to dismiss and would take the position that it doesn't 2 matter; even if women can now do 99 percent of the -3 the things that are done in the military, the 4 Registration Act is still constitutional. Wouldn't you 5 take that position? 6 MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, I don't -7 JUSTICE ALITO: Would you say that if -- if 8 it can be proven that they've -- that women are now -9 that the percentage is now high enough, the statute may 10 be unconstitutional? 11 Anyway, assuming that you might take that 12 position, then -- and you might win on that -- then what 13 would be the point of having all of this discovery that 14 you're talking about? 15 MR. FEIGIN: Well -16 JUSTICE ALITO: All of this -- all of this 17 development of the factual record? What -- what sense 18 does it make to develop a big factual record before you 19 know whether it's even -- whether it even makes any 20 difference? 21 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, the way to 22 deal with that would be to just have a very quick stop 23 in the MSPB which assures itself, yes, this is a 24 constitutional challenge to a statute. As the Court 25 recognized in Weinberger v. Salfi, for example, it is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
54 1 useful to have -- at least exhaust the claim with the 2 agency for that purpose. Yes -3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any rule of the 4 board that stops a litigant from making a proffer -- an 5 offer of proof? 6 MR. FEIGIN: There is not, Your Honor, and, 7 in fact, it would be -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wouldn't that be the 9 proper way of doing it, if you're going to go up on a 10 constitutional claim? Make your offer of proof, and 11 then the Federal Circuit can decide if it needs more 12 evidence or not. 13 MR. FEIGIN: That's where I was going with 14 this, Your Honor. In fact, the MSPB has a special 15 rule -- I believe it's 5 C.S.R. 1201.61; it's cited in 16 our brief -- where even if the MSPB decided not to 17 accept evidence for some reason, a description of the 18 evidence would go in the record and, therefore, be 19 available for the Federal Circuit. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- I guess 21 that the party doesn't -- doesn't even have to raise its 22 constitutional claim before the MSPB, does it? 23 MR. FEIGIN: Well, the Federal -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, it's pretty 25 odd to say that you've somehow waived a claim you
Alderson Reporting Company

1 couldn't pursue.

Official

55

2 MR. FEIGIN: Well, the Federal Circuit has

3 in analogous cases decided constitutional claims that

4 weren't raised in front of an agency when the agency

5 couldn't decide them. In the Government's view, it

6 would make sense to exhaust, for the reasons I was

7 explaining earlier and to Justice Ginsburg, which is

8 that it may be that the MSPB finds that the statute

9 doesn't really cover the situation. Now, I acknowledge

10 that's not going to happen in this case; it is clear

11 that section 3328 required these people's removals.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. You're -- you're

13 actually proposing that you have to exhaust questions

14 that the agency has no authority to decide?

15 MR. FEIGIN: Yes, Your Honor. I think the

16 Court has recognized --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Curiouser and curiouser.

18 (Laughter.)

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you don't bring before

20 the agency a question that the agency says it has no

21 authority to decide, you have forfeited your ability?

22 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I don't think

23 what should happen in this -- in a case like this is

24 that the employee appeals to the MSPB and says nothing

25 at all. The employee should appeal to the MSPB and at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 least say what his constitutional claim is. And the

56

2 benefit of that, as the Court has recognized in, for

3 example, Weinberger v. Salfi, is that the agency can

4 assure itself, yes, it's a constitutional claim that is

5 beyond my authority to resolve, and there's no other way

6 for me to resolve it.

7 Another benefit of presenting these claims

8 to the agency is the MSPB hasn't been crystal clear

9 about exactly where its authority begins and ends; and

10 neither the Federal Circuit nor this Court has addressed

11 that question at all. And allowing the agency in the

12 first instance to determine whether it has the authority

13 to grant the plaintiff the relief he is seeking has a

14 great benefit of clarifying what the scope of the MSPB's

15 authority is. It makes a lot more sense for the MSPB

16 and the Federal Circuit to be deciding what the scope of

17 the MSPB's authority is than it is to file a claim in

18 the District of Massachusetts and have that district

19 court and then the First Circuit debating about what the

20 proper scope of the MSPB's authority is.

21 I think the CSRA expresses a clear

22 preference that appeals of adverse actions like this go

23 through the MSPB and to the Federal Circuit, so that

24 they can decide those kinds of questions. Again --

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did -- where did

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
57 1 Salfi go? The agency couldn't decide the constitutional 2 question. So, what's the next stop? Was it a court of 3 appeals or the district court? 4 MR. FEIGIN: In Salfi, Your Honor? 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 6 MR. FEIGIN: That would have been in 7 district court. However, under 42 U.S.C. 405(g), which 8 was at issue in Salfi and Illinois Council, the district 9 court is performing essentially appellate-style review 10 of the agency's findings. That is, any -- the preferred 11 course is that any additional factfindings that would be 12 necessary would be made on remand and not taken by the 13 district court. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not on the constitutional 15 question. 16 MR. FEIGIN: I think it would still be the 17 preferred course that the agency would do any further 18 factfinding that would be necessary in the first 19 instance. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? The district court 21 is -- that's what it's equipped to do. That's what it 22 does all the time. And -23 MR. FEIGIN: Well, under 405(g), rather than 24 1331, the preferred form of factfinding is in the agency 25 and remands to the agency for further factfinding,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 rather than development of the facts in the district

58

2 court in the first instance.

3 In any event, the Court has recognized that

4 in Thunder Basin, for example, where review in the first

5 instance was in the court of appeals, that the court of

6 appeals had adequate authority to give meaningful

7 judicial review to a constitutional claim that an

8 agency, in that case the Mine Commission, by hypothesis

9 could not decide.

13 Mr. Schwartz, you have 2 minutes remaining.

14 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY A. SCHWARTZ

15 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

16 MR. SCHWARTZ: Thank you. We're not here

17 for an exercise in which side can best rewrite the Civil

18 Service Reform Act so that the Petitioners' claims can

19 fit in it. What we're here for is to determine whether

20 the background rule that Federal courts have Federal

21 question jurisdiction, under the common law and under

22 section 1331, to rule on claims challenging the

23 constitutionality of an act of Congress.

24 Now, the fall-back position is that that

25 jurisdiction remains. What this Court is -- is tasked

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
59 1 to do is to see whether it's fairly discernible from the 2 Civil Service Reform Act as it was written by Congress, 3 not as it's twisted or amended or bent to fit these 4 claims in it, but whether the Civil Service Reform Act 5 as written by Congress revokes that background Federal 6 court jurisdiction. 7 And I suggest that the gyrations that have 8 been discussed about, well, we could do this, we could 9 go up, we could go down, we could do these odd 10 procedures, show that it is not fairly discernible that 11 Congress intended to somehow try to shoehorn these 12 claims within the CSRA framework. And for that reason, 13 not because the Government's system is better, not 14 because the system that I'm proposing works better or is 15 faster, but because there is no fairly discernible 16 evidence from the Civil Service Reform Act, as written 17 by Congress, that Congress intended to revoke this very 18 fundamental jurisdiction of the district courts. 19 This is a Marbury case, not a Bivens case. 20 This is fundamental jurisdiction, the power of the 21 Federal court to say that Congress, not some Federal 22 agency, but that Congress acted in violation of the 23 Constitution. And I suggest that it -- the Court should 24 act carefully before deciding that Congress took that 25 fundamental jurisdiction away from the district courts,
