1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:01 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument first this morning in Case 08-7412, 5 Graham v. Florida. 6 Mr. Gowdy. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN S. GOWDY 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. GOWDY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 Sentencing an adolescent to life without any 12 possibility of parole condemns him to die in prison and 13 rejects any hope that he will change for the better. 14 This sentence, like the death penalty, cruelly ignores 15 the inherent qualities of youth and the differences 16 between adolescents and adults. At -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you urging that in 18 all cases, including homicide cases? Or are you drawing 19 the line at homicide? 20 MR. GOWDY: We are -- we are drawing the 21 line, Your Honor, at -- at non-homicide cases because we 22 recognize under the Eighth Amendment that we must look 23 at societal consensus, and society has said that murder 24 is different and has said that in the sentencing 25 practices, as demonstrated by the fact that outside of

1 Florida judges and juries have imposed this sentence on 2 just 30 non-homicide offenders in just 6 States. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thirty-eight States 4 allow this sentence, though, don't they? 5 MR. GOWDY: Thirty -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thirty-eight, 39. I 7 know you have a little dispute, but the vast majority of 8 States allow the imposition of this sentence. 9 MR. GOWDY: The vast majority allow it and 10 they have for some time, and we believe that the fact 11 that it has been allowed for so long and imposed so 12 rarely, as the States themselves have admitted, is -- is 13 strong evidence of societal consensus. 14 JUSTICE ALITO: You're making a -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought 16 that would be strong evidence that they appreciate the 17 gravity of the sentence in the particular circumstances 18 of juveniles and therefore only impose it rarely. 19 MR. GOWDY: Your Honor, I would -- I would 20 disagree. I would -- if -- if there's 30 -- 31 States 21 that have allowed it and have never imposed it, in -- in 22 our judgment, that -- that's evidence that it's very 23 unusual, and you couple that -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: No sentence can be -- can 25 be imposed rarely?

1 MR. GOWDY: No, Your Honor, it has to ­2 JUSTICE SCALIA: When a sentence is imposed 3 rarely, it becomes unconstitutional? 4 MR. GOWDY: No, Your Honor. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not your position? 6 What -7 MR. GOWDY: Our position is that you are 8 looking at two things. One, is it cruel? It's cruel 9 because life without parole is unique, is particularly 10 cruel to adolescents because it -- it gives up on the 11 adolescent and determines that he is forever unfit to 12 live in civil society. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't make it crueler 14 to him. I don't see why it's any crueler to an 15 adolescent than it is to -- what -- where do you draw 16 the line? At 21? 17 MR. GOWDY: We draw the line at 18, the same 18 line that the Court drew in Roper. And it's cruel 19 because of the inherent -- the inherent qualities of 20 youth. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: And you are making a per se 22 argument, no? You can imagine someone who is a month 23 short of his 18th birthday, and you are saying that, no 24 matter what this person does, commits the most horrible 25 series of non-homicide offenses that you can imagine, a
5 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 whole series of brutal rapes, assaults that render 2 the -- the victim paraplegic but not dead, no matter 3 what, the person is sentenced shows no remorse 4 whatsoever, the worst case you can possibly imagine, 5 cannot -- that person must at some point be made 6 eligible for parole. That's your argument? 7 MR. GOWDY: Your Honor, that's -- that's 8 correct. The life -- yes. A life with parole sentence 9 would be constitutional, and that may mean that person 10 you describe still spends his entire life in prison, but 11 life with parole gives some hope to the adolescent who 12 has an inherent capacity to change. It gives him some 13 hope that later in time he may be released. 14 JUSTICE ALITO: If we agree with you -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: And so if it's -16 JUSTICE ALITO: If we agree with you, at 17 what point must the parole consideration be given? 18 There is a suggestion in your brief that maybe the 19 Colorado statute, which says that a person can get 20 parole consideration after 40 years, would be 21 constitutional. Is that your position? 22 MR. GOWDY: Your Honor, our position is that 23 it should be left up to the States to decide. We think 24 that the -- the Colorado provision would probably be 25 constitutional. We will have to see what different
6 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 States do. I mean, but -- but, yes, even that long 2 amount of time would give at least some hope to the 3 adolescent offender. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what 5 if it's the -- pursuant to the usual State parole 6 system, and it turns out that grants parole to 1 out of 7 20 applicants? 8 MR. GOWDY: I think all that would have to 9 be required, Your Honor -- I think that would be 10 sufficient. All that would have to be required is a 11 meaningful opportunity to the adolescent offender to 12 demonstrate that he has in fact changed, reformed, and 13 is now fit to live in society. It -- that's all. 14 That's all we are asking for. 15 We are not asking that it be automatic right 16 to get back out. If Terrance Graham or Joe Sullivan -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that 18 your -- your argument suggests that you are, quite 19 rightly, focusing on the particular facts that have life 20 without parole. But if you concede that it's all right 21 to have a sentence of 50 years and then a consideration 22 where 1 out of 20 people are granted parole, I think it 23 suggests that the line you would draw is -- is pretty 24 artificial -- or certainly suggests that the next case 25 we will get is somebody with life with parole after

1 50 years. 2 MR. GOWDY: Your Honor, first, I'm -- I'm 3 not conceding that with 50. The question was asked 4 about 40. But I understand -5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you saying there 6 is something in the Eighth Amendment that draws a 7 distinction between 40 and 50 in that case? 8 MR. GOWDY: Your Honor, I'm saying that this 9 sentence that we are here today before is unequivocally, 10 unmistakably a condemnation that you will never be 11 released from prison, and so this sentence clearly falls 12 on the line of being cruel because it tells an 13 adolescent, for an adolescent mistake, you can never 14 live in civil society. 15 There will be other sentences that people 16 will argue are the equivalent of this sentence, and -17 and people may argue that with a 50-year sentence. But 18 this sentence here is unequivocal, and there is no 19 question that it's cruel because of -- of the fact that 20 it rejects any hope that the adolescent can be changed. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it a fact that -22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm interested in -- in 23 two different things and you can address them during the 24 course of your argument. One is the assumption of the 25 argument seems to be that there are in place parole --

1 throughout all the States -- parole systems which are 2 effective, which are operating, and that they have the 3 capacity to make accurate judgments about 4 rehabilitation. What can I read -- what -- what studies 5 do you have to -- that -- that comment on that? 6 Secondly, unrelated, at some point I think 7 you ought to talk about the procedural bar, which is 8 something you go over very, very, very -- let's see -9 that's Sullivan. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the other case. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Pardon me. That's 12 Sullivan, yes. 13 MR. GOWDY: With leave, I will let 14 Mr. Stevenson answer about the procedural bar. 15 But on the first question, Your Honor, I 16 would point you to the amicus brief filed by the various 17 correctional officers that talk about the types of 18 programs that can be done. I think that that has -- is 19 very thorough and -- and would answer it far better than 20 I can in a couple minutes up here. 21 But, yes, to answer short, we -- we believe 22 that -- that the parole systems in place can be 23 effective to do this, and in all seven States where 24 there are currently non-homicide juvenile offenders, 25 they all have functioning parole systems.

1 Even Florida has it. Even though it -- it 2 abolished parole in 1983, Florida still has 6,000 3 parole-eligible inmates and last year they heard over -4 they made over 1,700 parole determinations. So the -5 the administrative burden to the State of adding these 6 ­7 JUSTICE ALITO: But Florida has abolished 8 parole, has it not, going forward? 9 MR. GOWDY: Going forward, it has abolished 10 parole -11 JUSTICE ALITO: So eventually, if things are 12 allowed to take their course, the Florida parole board 13 will go out of business. 14 MR. GOWDY: And Florida could choose to make 15 that sentence and instead impose a sentence, as its 16 prosecutor recommended here, a 30-year determinant 17 sentence, if Florida doesn't want to reinstitute parole. 18 We are not saying it has to do parole. That's just one 19 of several constitutional options. 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what would you do 21 if there were a crime spree and there were different 22 jurisdictions? One jurisdiction imposes for 35 years, 23 the next jurisdiction for another 35 years, to be served 24 consecutively. 25 MR. GOWDY: Well, Your -- Your Honor, I -- I
10 Alderson Reporting Company

1 think that the -- that you would get into the question 2 about whether that sentence is the equivalent of life 3 without parole, and there could be an argument made that 4 if you -- obviously, if you sentence someone to 150, 5 200 years, there's no conceivable hope of ever release, 6 150 years without parole. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the second jurisdiction 8 has the obligation, but not the first? Is that the way 9 it works? 10 MR. GOWDY: I would think that the -- if you 11 had that -- I would think that the -- that the judge 12 making that sentence would have to take that into 13 consideration, that this sentence is going to -- based 14 on all adolescent conduct -- it has to be all adolescent 15 conduct, not if some of the conduct is post-juvenile. 16 But, yes, I would think that the -- that the second 17 sentencing judge would need to take that into 18 consideration. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: So he -- he could sentence 20 up to 1 year before the life expectancy of the -- of 21 the person in prison? That -- that would be okay? 22 MR. GOWDY: I -- I wouldn't say that would 23 be okay, Your Honor. I think that -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what's he supposed to 25 do? How many years can he give --

1 MR. GOWDY: I think -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- consecutive? 3 MR. GOWDY: I think there has to be some -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: There obviously does. What 5 do you propose? I propose, you know, 1 year before 6 his life expectancy. 7 MR. GOWDY: Your -- Your Honor, I think that 8 would be coming so close to the -- the constitutional 9 line, it would be -- it would be difficult to see that 10 as constitutional, but -- but -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, 1 year before life is 12 also unconstitutional? 13 MR. GOWDY: Your Honor, I'm -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Two years before life? 15 MR. GOWDY: Your -- Your Honor, there would 16 definitely be a -- a difficult line to draw at that 17 case. Life without parole, though, is unequivocal. And 18 even that sentence that you are describing, there is 19 some difference between it and life without parole, 20 because only life without parole makes the unequivocal 21 assessment that the adolescent cannot be returned to 22 civil society. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have -- you are 24 arguing for a categorical rule. 25 MR. GOWDY: Yes.
12 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the 2 other side is arguing for a categorical rule, always 3 permissible. But we have a precedent that suggests in 4 -- in an individual case, you assess the proportionality 5 of the sentence to the crime. 6 Now, we know from Roper that death is 7 different, and we know from Roper that juveniles are 8 different. Wouldn't it make sense to incorporate the 9 consideration of the juvenile status into the 10 proportionality review? So that if you do have a case 11 where it's the 17-year-old who is 1 week shy of his 12 18th birthday and it is the most grievous crime 13 spree you can imagine, you can determine that in that 14 case life without parole may not be disproportionate. 15 But if it's -- and I know you would argue 16 that these are the facts here -- if it's a less grievous 17 crime and there is, for example, a younger defendant 18 involved, then in that case maybe it is 19 disproportionate. 20 Why -- why doesn't that seem more sensitive? 21 And it avoids all of the line-drawing problems we have 22 been discussing. 23 MR. GOWDY: Well, two things: First, Your 24 Honor, Roper states, and the science -- states it based 25 on the science, that at that age we cannot make a
13 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 determination about whether or not the adolescent will 2 or will not reform. Even an expert psychologist, 3 psychiatrist cannot do it. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I understand. 5 But I don't think they'll say that we can't make that 6 determination at 17 years 51 months, but we can make 7 that determination at 18 years 1 month. 8 MR. GOWDY: Well, anywhere you draw the 9 line, Your Honor, you're going to come up with an 10 example where you are 1 day before or 1 day after, and 11 the Court in Roper struggled with where to draw the line 12 between maturity and immaturity, and it concluded, 13 rightly so, to draw the line at 18 based on both the 14 science and the legislative determinations. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that is because, 16 as they told us, death is different. And you do -- once 17 you decide that, you do have to draw a line somewhere. 18 I'm just wondering why we have to go all the way in with 19 you or all the way with your opponent when our precedent 20 allows us to consider an issue of this sort on a case 21 by-case basis. 22 MR. GOWDY: I think it's because adolescents 23 are different. Adolescents are different in that we 24 can't tell at this age whether they are going to reform 25 or not. And all we are proposing is that an adolescent
14 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 not necessarily be released, but that he be given a 2 later opportunity. And it boils -- it just comes down 3 to adolescents are different, Your Honor, and the 4 determination can't be made at age 17 even for the most 5 heinous crimes that are committed. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any difference 7 in the terms of incarceration making this harsher than 8 otherwise? I think you suggested in -- in your brief 9 that educational and vocational training is not given to 10 people who are in for life without parole because they 11 will never be out on the street so they don't need to be 12 transitioned back. 13 MR. GOWDY: If I understand your question, 14 would it be different if those type of programs are made 15 available to life-without- -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: My question is, first, 17 you say that they are not available. 18 MR. GOWDY: Yes. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that -- that's so? 20 MR. GOWDY: Yes, that is generally true. 21 And the -- and the very website that the State of 22 Florida cites makes a point of saying that the programs 23 are for the purpose of reentry into society, and so 24 those are obviously the opposite of what life 25 without parole is. You are never going to reenter
15 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 society. And it's generally true that those programs 2 are not available to offenders who get life without 3 parole, and that's what makes the sentence so 4 particularly cruel, to give up on a kid at that point in 5 his life. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what are the terms of 7 incarceration? They just stay in their cells and ­8 MR. GOWDY: Well, Your Honor, I think it 9 varies obviously by facility by facility. But the 10 sentence means you are going to stay in your cell and 11 die there. You are going to stay in your cell for 60 or 12 70 years, whenever you reach your natural death, and die 13 there. 14 You know, they -- they do have some limited 15 freedoms, as the State of Florida has pointed out, the 16 same types of freedoms that people on death row have. 17 But ultimately both sentences mean that you are going to 18 die in a State-controlled institution. And they are 19 very hopeless -20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think -- the same 21 kind of freedom that people on death row have? I -22 MR. GOWDY: Well, the State makes the point 23 in their brief, Your Honor, that you have the right to 24 exercise your religion, you have the -- you have the 25 right to petition the courts.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Aren't they released into 2 the general population for exercise, for -- which I 3 don't think death row inmates are. 4 MR. GOWDY: Your Honor, I -- obviously 5 everything varies facility by facility, but it's -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I doubt whether this 7 varies. I -- I don't know of any principle where if you 8 are in for life, you are in solitary. 9 MR. GOWDY: Well, I'm not -- I'm not -- you 10 are correct. I'm not suggesting they are in solitary 11 confinement. But they are locked up for the rest of 12 their life, and they're not allowed to rejoin civil 13 society even if, as some of the former juvenile 14 offenders who filed a brief in this case, can 15 demonstrate that they have become model citizens. 16 JUSTICE ALITO: And why isn't the -- the 17 most sensible way to deal with the problem that you are 18 raising, the one that the Chief Justice suggested, to 19 permit as-applied proportionality challenges that take 20 into account the particular circumstances of the 21 juvenile in question, rather than this per se rule that 22 you are advocating, which would deprive the State of 23 Florida from reaching the judgment that there are some 24 -- there are some juveniles, some individuals who are 25 short of their 18th birthday, who cannot -- who deserve

1 imprisonment in -- life imprisonment without parole? 2 Some of the actual cases that -- in which 3 this sentence has been imposed in Florida involve 4 factual situations that are so horrible that I couldn't 5 have imagined them if I hadn't actually seen them. 6 Raping an 8-year-old girl and burying her alive. Are 7 you familiar with that case? 8 MR. GOWDY: I am not familiar with that 9 particular case. No. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: Raping a woman in front of 11 her 12-year-old son and then forcing the son to engage 12 in sexual conduct with the mother. Are you familiar 13 with that case? 14 MR. GOWDY: Yes, Your Honor, I am familiar 15 with that case. 16 Your Honor, the reason, first of all, the 17 Court has said and said so clearly in Kennedy that 18 murder is different. In the Kennedy decision, you also 19 said: Horrible facts, someone who raped their 20 stepdaughter. But yet this Court drew a line and 21 exempted from capital punishment adult defendants who 22 commit horrible crimes. 23 But to get to the core of your question as 24 to why not do it on a case-by-case basis, because you 25 can only make the determination about the adolescent
18 Alderson Reporting Company

1 later in life. And I -- we would agree that there 2 should be a case-by-case determination as to -- as to 3 whether or not that offender should spend his whole life 4 in prison, but we say it needs to happen later, once he 5 has matured, once he's reached past adulthood, because 6 when you're -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: You assume -- doesn't your 8 argument assume that the only purpose of punishment is 9 deterrence in the sense of protecting society from this 10 person in the future, so that, you know, once that's no 11 longer a problem, we should let this person out. But 12 that isn't the only purpose of punishment that we've 13 acknowledged. One of the purposes is retribution, 14 punishment for just perfectly horrible actions. And I 15 don't know why that value of retribution diminishes to 16 the point of zero when it's a person who's, you know, 17 17 years 9 months old. 18 MR. GOWDY: We are not suggesting that it 19 goes to the point of zero. We're not -- and we concede 20 the State has a right to -- to exact retribution from 21 the juvenile offender. And in this case, 30 years would 22 have been a lot of retribution for Terrance Graham, both 23 -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Most States didn't -- don't 25 think so, or many States don't think so.
19 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. GOWDY: Well, Your Honor, we -- but a 2 Juvenile is -- not only does he have an inherent 3 capacity to grow; he is less culpable. And so to exact 4 the most -- for a non-homicide crime whether you are 5 adult or juvenile, this is the most severe punishment 6 you can receive, and to exact that most severe 7 punishment for a less culpable offender that the Court 8 has recognized is a less culpable offender doesn't -- is 9 too much retribution. We are not saying the State can't 10 exercise retribution, but that life without parole is -11 is too much for those types of crimes. 12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gowdy, can I ask this 13 question? 14 MR. GOWDY: Yes, Justice. 15 JUSTICE STEVENS: If your client in this 16 case had been processed in the juvenile system instead 17 of the adult system, what would the maximum penalty he 18 could have received been? 19 MR. GOWDY: He would have had to have been 20 released when he was 22 years. 21 JUSTICE STEVENS: So the choice is between 22 that short a term and an indefinite term? 23 MR. GOWDY: No, no, Your Honor. We -- we 24 concede that the State of Florida may continue to 25 prosecute juveniles in adult court and that makes sense

1 in order to get a term of years that is longer than you 2 can get in juvenile court. And in this case, if the 3 judge had gone along with the prosecutor's 4 recommendation, it would have meant a 30-year sentence 5 for my client, which would have been far longer than he 6 could have gotten in the juvenile court. Worse -7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The logic in Roper 8 was very straightforward. It says, "Death is reserved 9 for the worst of the worst." I think that was the 10 quote. We know that juveniles are not the worst of 11 the worst, for the reasons you have articulated, that 12 they are not fully developed, don't have moral sense to 13 the same extent as an adult. But life without parole is 14 not reserved for the worst of the worst, and so it seems 15 to me that the logic of our precedent suggests that you 16 can't necessarily rely on the juvenile status to exempt 17 them from a penalty that is not reserved for the worst 18 of the worst, but perhaps it makes sense to consider in 19 a particular instance whether the penalty is 20 disproportionate, given the juvenile's characteristics 21 that you suggest. 22 MR. GOWDY: Well, I guess we will come back 23 to the point that I think life with parole would be a 24 long sentence, and I don't -- I don't see how you can do 25 it on a case-by-case basis at age 17. You can certainly

1 do it -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there 3 disproportionality review generally in Florida and 4 particularly for juvenile offenders? 5 MR. GOWDY: There is no -- no. Under 6 Florida law, there is no basis to challenge a sentence 7 as being excessive or disproportionate as long as it's 8 at the statutory maximum. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there wasn't 10 prior to our death penalty jurisprudence, either. And I 11 thought we reviewed proportionality as a matter of 12 Federal law in the Solem case. 13 MR. GOWDY: Right. I guess I understood 14 Justice Ginsburg's question as if under Florida law. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 17 MR. GOWDY: Can you -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so did I, but 19 we are talking about constitutionality under the Eighth 20 Amendment -21 MR. GOWDY: Right. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- which is Federal 23 law. 24 MR. GOWDY: I guess a -- I know under 25 Federal -- under Federal sentencing law, statutory law,
22 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 there's a reasonableness review. And I was -- I guess 2 I was trying to draw a comparison with, and maybe I'm 3 not answering the question correctly, that we don't have 4 that in Florida. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, that's what I meant, 6 whether you'd have to create a -- a procedure that does 7 not exist in Florida for proportionality review. 8 MR. GOWDY: Well, there would -- it would 9 have to be strictly Federal law. It would have to be a 10 procedure on a -- if you do this case-by-case 11 suggestion, it would -- it would have to be strictly 12 based on Federal constitutional law, because -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, sure, but you can make 14 that claim in Florida courts, can't you? 15 MR. GOWDY: You can -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can't you argue in Florida 17 courts that this sentence is disproportionate and 18 violates the Eighth Amendment, whereupon the Florida 19 courts would have to decide? Wouldn't they have to 20 decide that question? 21 MR. GOWDY: You -- you could make that 22 argument. And we do -- we do -- I should point out to 23 the Court that we do have a fallback position in our 24 papers based on Mr. Graham's offense of armed burglary 25 and -- and the fact that in only two States could Mr.

1 Graham have gotten this sentence and that the only State 2 that has actually imposed it for a first-time armed 3 burglary is Florida. And it -4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a problem 5 with that argument in this case, because the sentencing 6 judge made it quite plain that he was treating Graham as 7 a recidivist, not as a first-time offender. He said -8 Graham got a very light sentence, just 12 months in 9 detention and then 3 years' probation, and the judge 10 said: Now, you better toe the line or else you could be 11 put away for a long time. 12 And then he committed -- it really was ­13 the sentence was for the later activities, even though 14 they weren't proved beyond a reasonable doubt. I think 15 that Graham admitted to a couple of -- to more armed 16 robberies. Isn't that so? 17 MR. GOWDY: He -- he admitted to the police, 18 and I don't want to get too much into the facts, but 19 that -- but even if Your Honor concedes that he was 20 convicted of all those crimes, which he was not 21 convicted of, but the judge, as you say, correctly 22 relied upon for this sentence, then we only have two 23 States that we know of that have imposed life without 24 parole for a recidivist robbery or burglary crime, and 25 that's California and Florida.

1 And we -- we've set forth that argument to 2 give the Court that option, but we believe our primary 3 argument, the categorical rule, is more logical because 4 of the fact that you can't do a case-by-case 5 determination of an adolescent at the time -- based on 6 his juvenile offense. And maybe, in these horrible 7 crimes -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you haven't answered 9 Justice Alito's point, which is: What's the difference 10 a month before he's 18 and a month after?

You don't have to draw a line 4 then, and that's the attraction of that approach. 5 MR. GOWDY: You -- I -- I think that the -6 -- based on -- I would just ask to conclude and then I 7 will sit down. 8 Based on the -- on what scientists have told 9 us, the categorical approach is the most logical 10 approach because we can't tell which adolescents are 11 going to change and which aren't. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 13 Gowdy. 14 Mr. Makar. 15 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT D. MAKAR 16 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 17 MR. MAKAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 18 please the Court: 19 The categorical rule that Petitioner seeks 20 here would undermine what Florida and other States have 21 adopted in terms of juvenile justice. And in 22 particular, it would go against three major trends, that 23 being strong punishment for serious violent crimes by 24 juveniles; second trend, transfer laws allowing 25 juveniles to be treated as adults; those laws have been
26 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 enacted in the last 15 years -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did that -3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't -- I didn't hear 4 the second. 5 MR. GOWDY: I'm sorry. 6 The three trends are: The strong punishment 7 for juveniles that States have enacted over the last 158 20 years; the various transfer and waiver laws that 9 States have enacted over the last 10, 15, 20 years 10 allowing juveniles to be transferred into adult court; 11 and then finally, what is really at issue is parole. 12 Parole has been eliminated in many States. Fifteen 13 States have totally eliminated it in the last 10, 15 14 years. So what they are seeking is a categorical rule 15 that goes against the national consensus and the 16 national trend. 17 The concession here was that Graham's 18 sentence could be even up to life as long as there is 19 the possibility of parole. We believe that's very 20 telling. In their brief, they point out that Graham 21 could have been sentenced to something just short of his 22 actuarial life. His actuarial life is around 64 years 23 old, which means just about a 46-year sentence. 24 And the standard that we suggest here is 25 that there cannot be any categorical rule, for the

1 reasons Justice Alito pointed out. We have -2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you are 3 arguing for a categorical rule of your own. You are 4 saying that under a -- under -- juveniles under the age 5 of 18, what, it's never -- it can be never determinative 6 that they are juvenile in setting the sentence as a 7 matter of Federal law? 8 MR. MAKAR: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we do 9 agree in Florida and other States as well that age does 10 matter, and we ask that there be three things that the 11 Court look at. 12 First, look at the legislative structure. 13 Florida structure doesn't -- Florida structure is a very 14 balanced, thoughtful approach, in waiving children into 15 the adult court only when it's a violent crime and only 16 under certain -- when certain ages are in play. Look at 17 the age. It does play a role. The judicial discretion 18 plays a role. The trial judge -19 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this: Is there 20 a minimum age when a juvenile can be transferred to -21 to adult procedures? 22 MR. MAKAR: It's a three-tiered system, 23 Justice Stevens. And let me -24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I'm just interested 25 in one. Is there a minimum?
28 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. MAKAR: Yes. The way in which -2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that an arbitrary line, 3 or how do you -- how do we know it shouldn't be higher 4 or lower than the line? 5 MR. MAKAR: Well, the legislature has set 6 the line at 14-15 for certain crimes and 16-17 for 7 others. And then for indictment, where it goes to a 8 grand jury, there is no age limitation. That has been 9 on our books for the better part of 50, 60 years, 10 allowing indictment -- allowing the grand jury to make a 11 decision about whether the particular juvenile shall be 12 brought into the adult court. So -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then the -- what 14 is your objection to an approach that when you are 15 dealing with life without parole, for the reasons that 16 your brother has articulated, you must as a matter of 17 Federal law consider the juvenile status of the 18 defendant before that sentence is imposed? 19 MR. MAKAR: Well -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, not 21 a -- not a categorical rule that it automatically makes 22 a difference, but not a categorical rule that it can 23 never make a difference? 24 MR. MAKAR: Well, sure. And as I say, 25 there's the three factors I would ask the Court to look
29 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 at. 2 First, the structure that we have here in 3 Florida, which many States have, that deal with the age. 4 Age does matter. Ninety-nine out of 100 juvenile 5 offenders in our system do not go into adult court, and 6 an even smaller percentage of that ultimately get into 7 the adult sanctions. 8 The trial judges in Florida, unless -9 unless it's a very violent crime, have some discretion 10 to sentence as to age. If you look at the transcript 11 here in the joint appendix, the trial judge here 12 struggled with this, struggled with age, and said: 13 Juvenile sanctions are inappropriate; youthful offenders 14 -- youthful offender sanctions are inappropriate; I'm 15 going to sentence you to -- to adult. 16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but could I interrupt 17 with one question? Isn't it correct that the age is 18 relevant on whether or not to transfer the person to the 19 adult system, but once he's in the adult system, age is 20 entirely immaterial? 21 MR. MAKAR: That's not accurate, Justice 22 Stevens. Under the statute 985.226, 227, and 225, we 23 have a system in which the grounds are set for when 24 juveniles can be either mandatorily or discretionarily 25 brought into the adult system.
30 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 And then under the statute 985, the 2 punishment is graduated. In other words, for the lower 3 offenses, the juvenile sanctions must be considered and 4 the youthful offender sanctions must be considered. 5 It's only in certain limited instances, like indictment, 6 where it's a life offense, where the juvenile has been 7 indicted for life, that the trial judge is forced to do 8 adult sanctions. 9 In this case, Graham was under the 10 discretionary direct -- direct file, meaning that the 11 prosecutor had discretion whether to bring the case or 12 not. He brought it into the adult system. Graham 13 accepted being processed as an adult. He was put on 14 probation, and then -15 JUSTICE STEVENS: I still don't understand. 16 Just to make sure I get the point correct: After the 17 decision has been made to have them prosecuted in the 18 adult system, at that -- after that decision has been 19 made, is the age of the defendant a relevant factor in 20 sentencing? 21 MR. MAKAR: The age -- they get a 22 presentence report. The age is woven in -23 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand, but 24 statutorily? As a matter -25 MR. MAKAR: Well, the statute doesn't

1 specifically say the trial judge -2 JUSTICE STEVENS: The answer is no. It's -3 under the statutes, it's totally irrelevant after he has 4 been transferred to the adult stage. Is that correct? 5 MR. MAKAR: Not exactly, because the range 6 of remedies the trial judge can impose is based upon 7 what method by which the juvenile was transferred or 8 waived into the adult court. In Graham's case, he was 9 allowed to have juvenile and youthful offender sanctions 10 considered because of his age. I mean, that's the way 11 -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean the trial judge 13 under Florida law does not have discretion to choose a 14 lower sentence because of the -- of tender years of the 15 defendant? 16 MR. MAKAR: Well, absolutely, the trial 17 judge does. And you can see the trial judge here 18 grappling with that. 19 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the statute doesn't 20 draw any distinctions once he is in -- in the adult -21 MR. MAKAR: I guess the answer to your 22 question is there is no specific statute that says the 23 trial judge shall consider age specifically. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and 25 there's -- well, I guess that answers my question. He

1 is not required to as a matter of Federal law. He can 2 say: I am not considering the fact that this is a 3 juvenile because I think his crime should be treated as 4 an adult crime. 5 MR. MAKAR: No -- I mean, certainly not 6 under any Federal constitutional principle I am aware 7 of. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's what we 9 are arguing about. 10 MR. MAKAR: Right, right. Well, certainly 11 here, I mean, what we would say, assuming there is no 12 categorical rule and the Court decides to go into the 13 proportionality balance here, we think that certainly 14 Graham's offense certainly is off the scales and would 15 be grossly -- probably be -- it would be -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- that's one of 17 the problems, is the individual sentencing judge might 18 think that Graham is a very bad individual, but the 19 prosecutor had a different judgment of it. And Florida 20 doesn't have any kind of proportionality review, doesn't 21 have any review -- appellate review of the sentences. 22 MR. MAKAR: Well -23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This judge, I think, 24 surprised everyone in the courtroom with the -- with the 25 sentence. Certainly it was far beyond what the
33 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 prosecutor recommended. 2 MR. MAKAR: Well, the prosecutor recommended 3 30 years, that's correct, and the judge here entered 4 life. As I say, that translates into -- essentially a 5 46-year actuarial life sentence. That was within the 6 trial judge's discretion, and particularly given the 7 seriousness of the offenses that Graham committed. We 8 are talking about violence. 9 And violence does matter. This Court has 10 said -- and certainly in oral argument in Solem and 11 others, the -- violence versus non-violent acts plays a 12 major role in sentencing, and it should play a major 13 role as well when it comes to juveniles. 14 I don't read Roper to say that it takes off 15 the table lengthy sentences for violent crimes by 16 juveniles. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -18 MR. MAKAR: Yes. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think 20 that it categorically violates the Eighth Amendment for 21 a 10-year-old to be sentenced to life without parole? 22 MR. MAKAR: Well, the answer to that is it 23 certainly raises a concern about the age. Age does 24 matter. And as the age goes down, it does. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So once it matters, the
34 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 question for me is -- help me draw the line -- if 10 is 2 in my judgment too early, why isn't 14, 16, or 18? 3 Meaning why should a -- someone below the age of 14 be 4 sentenced to life without parole? That's the -- that's 5 the Sullivan case -6 MR. MAKAR: Right. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but it begs the 8 question, which is age is -- matters a lot. And so, 9 take on your adversary's argument that it matters a lot 10 because this is a less culpable person. 11 MR. MAKAR: Sure. It matters -- I think it 12 does matter and it certainly matters from a legislative 13 perspective, from a judicial perspective, and from an 14 Eighth Amendment perspective. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about historical 16 perspective? I mean, you might appeal to the fact that 17 at common law, which was in effect when the Cruel and 18 Unusual Punishments Clause was adopted, 12 years was -19 was viewed as the year when a -- when a person reaches 20 the age of reason. And -- and the death penalty could 21 not be inflicted on anyone -22 MR. MAKAR: Well, certainly that historical 23 perspective has -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and all felonies were 25 the death penalty.

1 MR. MAKAR: Sure. And it has importance. 2 To some extent, the States have displaced the common law 3 with their juvenile justice systems. And we -- as I 4 say, I believe Florida's is -- is very balanced. 5 Going back to your question, Justice 6 Sotomayor, I think that the way age plays a role is that 7 we -- in our system in Florida, we have no one under the 8 age of 13. And that's sort of provides us -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You have no one? What 10 was your answer? 11 MR. MAKAR: I'm sorry. No -- no one in our 12 system is under the age of 13 with life without parole. 13 You know, there are very -14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that because judges 15 haven't chosen to impose it or because your legal system 16 doesn't permit it? 17 MR. MAKAR: No, the legal system permits it. 18 I -19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How young could the 20 youngest person in Florida be to be prosecuted as an 21 adult and be eligible for life -22 MR.

And 5 that that would be certainly violative of the -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In -- in your 7 earlier response to Justice Sotomayor's question, you 8 said age certainly matters. As -- as a -- as a matter 9 of what law? 10 In other words, I understood your submission 11 to be that there was nothing in Federal law that 12 requires different consideration of age. So when you 13 say age matters, why? 14 MR. MAKAR: Well, we suggest that it may 15 matter in a particular case, and when you get to the 16 gross disproportionality -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under the authority 18 of what law?

37 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 think just -- certainly age matters in the legislative 2 branch, judicial branch, executive branch. It matters 3 that we look at the age and make considerations about it 4 when Florida has made those considered judgments. 5 What we are saying is that if the Court 6 decides to go down the path that's perhaps fraught with 7 more line-drawing than one can imagine and decides that 8 age will be a part of the proportionality, it creates 9 serious problems. But here -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Why is 11 that? If you go down on a case-by-case basis, there are 12 no line-drawing problems. You just simply say age has 13 to be considered as a matter of the Eighth Amendment. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: And then we apply a 15 totality of the circumstances test -16 MR. MAKAR: Well -- well -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- which means whatever 18 seems -- seems like a good idea. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we apply the 20 proportionality review that we articulated in Harmelin, 21 and Solem and Ewing. 22 MR.

1 the Court, they are on the violent side of the line. 2 They are out in the tail of the distribution in terms of 3 seriousness of the offense. So it would be the same 4 result in either case. I think perhaps -5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are not seriously 6 suggesting that the crimes at issue here are comparable 7 to a rape or a permanent infliction of serious 8 disability or any of those other very violent crimes 9 that are close to homicide that Justice Alito spoke 10 about? There is a quantitative and qualitative 11 difference between those, isn't there? 12 MR. MAKAR: There is, but the legislatures 13 make the judgment about how they are going to punish 14 those. And in Florida, we have -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, if we -- if we 16 have already said that you can't impose death on an 17 adult who hasn't committed a homicide, an intentional 18 death, and so for an adult the most serious sentence 19 that we can give them is life without parole, why should 20 that same sentence be given to a juvenile who we have 21 recognized as being less capable than an adult? And why 22 should we permit it for a crime that's not comparable to 23 a homicide and/or something akin in seriousness to that? 24 MR. MAKAR: Because it is still a very 25 serious, violent crime. We are talking about weapons

1 and guns and people's lives at risk. And the 2 legislature has made the judgment in Florida and other 3 States to say that that type of crime -4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't it true -- and 5 I think one of my colleagues already questioned you -6 that the prosecutor didn't think that this merited life 7 without parole. Didn't the parole supervisor say that 8 this young man, Mr. Graham, was compliant with other 9 conditions of his probation? He went to school. He did 10 other things. It does suggest some hope for him. 11 MR. MAKAR: Well, I think the prosecutor 12 certainly offered up to 30 years. And the trial judge 13 who, as you can tell from the transcript, was familiar 14 that there were these home invasions going on around our 15 county, that there had been a task force established, 16 and so forth, the -- the trial judge was aware of that 17 and the seriousness of it. In one instance, one of 18 Graham's codefendants actually killed someone as a part 19 of a home invasion. These were serious problems 20 afflicting our community in Jacksonville. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know why the 22 co-perpetrators got so -- their sentences were 23 dramatically lower. Do we know why that was so? 24 MR. MAKAR: Is this as to the home invasion 25 or the armed ­-

MAKAR: He helped -- helped and 6 testified and basically assisted the prosecution, so I 7 believe he got a lower sentence. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because he assisted the 9 prosecutor. 10 MR. MAKAR: Right. The third one is in 11 jail, life without parole on a murder charge, life 12 without parole on the same charge Graham has for another 13 home invasion, and then has the other serious sentences. 14 So he -- for his home invasions, he is -- he is life 15 without prison -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't think he -17 MR. MAKAR: I mean, life without parole. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: For this very offense, 19 this home invasion, I didn't think that anyone other 20 than Graham had gotten life without parole. 21 MR. MAKAR: Well -- well, Graham got life 22 without parole, and it relates back to his armed 23 burglary with assault and battery. He got the life 24 sentence under that charge, which is then all part and 25 parcel of the violation-of-probation hearing. There

Official
1 were these secondary -- these second incidences of home 2 invasions where Meigo Bailey was the codefendant who got 3 life for murder and also for armed burglary as a part of 4 one of the home invasions. So they -- you know, they 5 got serious punishment. This is a serious punishment 6 that was meted out to them. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did he -- how do you 8 answer the argument that unlike an adult, because of the 9 immaturity, you can't really judge a person -- judge a 10 teenager at the point of sentencing? That it's only 11 after a period of time has gone by, and you see, has 12 this person overcome those youthful disabilities? 13 That's why a proportionality review on the spot doesn't 14 accommodate the -- what is the driving force of the -15 your -- the Petitioner's argument is that you can't make 16 a judgment until years later to see how that person has 17 -- has done. 18 MR. MAKAR: Well, Justice Ginsburg, we 19 respect that, and certainly in Roper that was the 20 linchpin to the decision. Here we are in a different 21 context that deals with these -- these terms of years, 22 and there -- there's no constitutional right to parole. 23 And certainly that is a purely legislative decision to 24 be made, and States have said we are not going to have 25 parole.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose you could say the 2 same thing of -- of adults, of somebody over 18. You 3 really can't tell how redeemable this individual is 4 until he is in prison for some time; and, therefore, you 5 should not give anybody life without parole. They -6 they may all be savable. So we should defer -- defer. 7 We shouldn't have any non-parole sentences. Everybody 8 should be evaluated, which was indeed the approach that 9 -- that many jurisdictions used to take. Wasn't that so 10 -11 MR. MAKAR: True. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- when there was parole 13 for everybody? 14 MR. MAKAR: And it --- and it goes to the 15 core of the State's sovereignty to decide what laws to 16 enact. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Florida does -- and 18 every State -- recognize the difference between an adult 19 and a minor. And you have to make the line. We have it 20 at 18. But think of the teenager can't drink, can't 21 drive, can't marry. There are so many limitations on 22 children just because they are children. 23 MR. MAKAR: And, Justice Ginsburg, we ask 24 that the same respect for our juvenile justice system be 25 given to those laws enacted in Florida that protect the

It is the legislature on the ground 2 there and seeing what's going on in our State that makes 3 these decisions about who can drive, who gets the right 4 to have a tattoo, or who gets -5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they don't make it on 6 a case-by-case basis. They say no juvenile can drink -7 no juvenile. 8 MR. MAKAR: That's true but at the same -9 by the same token, the juvenile justice system in 10 Florida -- and keep in mind we had a juvenile justice 11 division -- department established in 1994 because of 12 the severe problems as we outlined in our brief -- that 13 Florida has a -- has committed resources and -- and 14 programs and so forth to the juvenile justice system. 15 So given all of that, that what the Court -- I am sorry 16 -- what the State has done as -- as to age, that's why 17 we say that it matters. 18 What we are concerned about is that to 19 pursue the categorical rule that they seek, the Court 20 would have to, of course, abandon the various firewalls 21 that would stand between terms of years and also the 22 death penalty. 23 But, in addition, if the Court decides to go 24 down the proportionality route, my concern is the five 25 principles in the Harmelin concurrence about the States
44 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 having the ability to have diverse juvenile justice 2 programs and not have the -- sort of a lawnmower coming 3 through and making them all uniform. The Harmelin 4 concurrence, Justice Kennedy, talked about the deference 5 in structuring these. And there's going to be 6 differences. Some States are going to have the most 7 harsh laws. The Eighth Amendment doesn't dictate any 8 particular penological theory. There's great -- and it 9 -- it would turn the Eighth Amendment analysis on its 10 head to first allow this diversity among the States and 11 allow strong medicine for certain types of violent 12 crimes and then to kind of compare them and say, well, 13 gosh, Florida is unusual; it's different; and that 14 shouldn't be the case whatsoever. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we look just at 16 deterrence, my initial instinct is that the difference 17 in life and life without -- life with parole and life 18 without parole is just not a factor in deterrence. I -19 I don't know how I'd confirm that one way or the other, 20 but let's -- let's assume that there is some basis for 21 that intuition. 22 Then, insofar as the deterrence prong is 23 concerned, since it's not a deterrent, and if you assume 24 that there is rehabilitation, what is the State's 25 interest in keeping the accused, the ­- the

MAKAR: Well -5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you could say 6 retribution, but then you have judges on a case-by-case 7 basis deciding when there should be retribution. 8 MR. MAKAR: Well, I think certainly the 9 State of Florida's interest as among other States is 10 first of all to punish. Certainly I think deterrence 11 plays a role. We recognize that deterrence may have 12 less impact on some juveniles, but it doesn't have -- it 13 doesn't have zero impact. It does have some impact -14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me the 15 deterrence interest is quite minimal if you assume 16 rehabilitation or strong evidence of rehabilitation. 17 MR. MAKAR: Well, but the deterrence goes to 18 those who would commit the same act. Rather than 19 deterring this particular individual, it goes to others 20 who -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the question 22 is: Will the difference between life with parole and 23 life without parole deter anybody?

1 Do any of the briefs or any of the materials with which 2 you are familiar discuss the rate of -- the difference 3 between the danger of recidivism of a young offender and 4 one who is, say, 40 or 50 years old? 5 MR. MAKAR: I -- I don't have that at my 6 grasp, but -7 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it seems to me sort of 8 -- as a matter of intuition, Justice Kennedy made the 9 same sort of point. It seems to me that the older 10 people are less likely to be recidivists than the 11 younger ones, but is -- is there any empirical evidence 12 that says that's an incorrect or correct judgment? 13 MR. MAKAR: Well, in terms of recidivism, I 14 think, number one, violence matters. I think there are 15 studies -- I can't quite put my finger on -- that 16 says that the violent offenders tend to recidivate more 17 than the non-violent. And that as one ages -- I think 18 Judge Posner has written a book called "Aging and Old 19 Age" that talks about -- in one of its chapters about 20 how age matters, and that crime rates go down as -- as 21 the population ages. So I mean there are those sorts of 22 things out there that -23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, along those 24 lines -- and, again, maybe this was in the amicus 25 briefs. Do you have a study about what age cohort is
48 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 responsible for most violent crime? 2 MR. MAKAR: There are -- there are studies 3 everywhere, and I have looked at many of them, and it 4 appears that it certainly increases from age 13, and it 5 goes up to 14. And it keeps going up until about 16, 6 17, and 18. It peaks. It depends on the crime, and it 7 depends upon what jurisdiction, and so forth. But it 8 tends to peak in the early 20s, the late teens or early 9 20s. So that's -- that's -- I think that's typical. 10 One thing I would point out that I haven't 11 had a chance to say: The empirical question in this 12 case, I think, is very important because they are asking 13 that a constitutional rule be established on studies 14 that have just been generated literally over this summer 15 and have not been subject to meaningful review. 16 We have a concern with that. We think that 17 the definitional questions that they have raised, you 18 know, about the offenses and what is life -- is life -19 the studies tend to focus on life. But what is life? 20 Well, in Florida we have some juveniles who are serving 21 prison terms that have 50-, 60-, 70-, 80-year sentences, 22 but they are not included within that study. 23 We also have in this case, for example, 24 Graham, he had a -- let's say that the judge decided to 25 give him 30 years for the main offense and 15 for the
49 Alderson Reporting Company

1 second and made them consecutive. That's 45 years. 2 Graham's actuarial life -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we are not sure that 4 those 70-year sentences are any good, either, because 5 your -- your friend on the other side, you know, is not 6 willing to -- to pick a number at which the sentence 7 amounts to life without parole. Maybe a 70-year 8 sentence does. 9 MR. MAKAR: Well, they've conceded, in their 10 brief, that what this all boils down to is that if 11 Graham wins and he gets to go back and be resentenced, 12 that either the Florida legislature has to pass a law to 13 reinstitute parole for this category of offenders, or 14 the trial judge could say, okay, the actuarial table 15 says you are going to live to be 64.2, we're going to -16 I'm going to sentence you to something less -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that there was 18 a parole system still functioning, so -- although it 19 will be phased out over time, but for people who 20 were incarcerated under the old regime -- and I think 21 the suggestion was that that system would take care of 22 the handful of people, not more than that, that this 23 decision would involve. 24 MR. MAKAR: There is still a parole board. 25 Its functions have been minimized greatly. It has not
50 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 been applicable to anyone since 1983. It would take a 2 legislative act or perhaps even an executive act of some 3 sort to reinstitute that board and to take account of 4 these cases. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell us just a 6 little bit about the Florida correctional systems, the 7 policies with respect to rehabilitation programs? If 8 they don't have parole, then you might say, well, they 9 don't need rehabilitation programs or that they might 10 need them more. 11 Had the rehabilitation programs been 12 increased or decreased since the phasing out of parole? 13 Or is it about the same? Or are they -- are they 14 non-existent? 15 MR. MAKAR: No, no. They are in existence. 16 I cannot specifically answer that, Justice Kennedy, 17 because I don't know all the different programs that are 18 available. There's the various programs that deal with 19 drug offenses and alcoholism and so forth. 20 And there -- there are certain educational 21 programs. For example, when Graham was in the county 22 jail -- that was the county versus the State -- he was 23 able to go to school. 24 I don't believe there is anywhere near sort 25 of the total absence and deprivation, sort of a Weems

1 case, sort of we put you in a cell and you rot there for 2 the rest of your life, at all in our system. There's 3 all these various rights that we pointed out in our 4 brief that are -- enable -- they are able to have 5 familial relationships. They can have the Maslow's 6 hierarchy. I mean, they -- physiological needs and 7 emotional needs and so forth are still available to be 8 met in prison. 9 So I can't give you specific programs, 10 Justice Kennedy, but in Florida's system, they do 11 exist. 12 If there's no further questions -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 14 Mr. Makar. 15 Mr. Gowdy, you have 4 minutes remaining. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why does a juvenile have a 17 constitutional right to hope, but an adult does not? 18 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN S. GOWDY 19 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 20 MR. GOWDY: Because the juvenile is 21 different than an adult. A juvenile is less culpable. 22 He's -- we know over time he will change and -- and 23 potentially reform, as opposed to an adult. Once you 24 are fully formed, you are more culpable and you don't 25 have that same inherent capacity to change.

1 JUSTICE ALITO: But do you know anybody who 2 is willing to say that, as a categorical matter, that -3 you know, the 18th birthday is the magical date for 4 every single person? 5 MR. GOWDY: No, Your Honor, and nobody was 6 willing to say that in Roper, but, yet, the Court still 7 drew the line at 18 for the death penalty in Roper. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: Because the Court, up to 9 this point, has said that death is different, and the 10 rules -- the Eighth Amendment rules in capital cases are 11 entirely different from the Eighth Amendment rules in -12 in all other cases. 13 MR. GOWDY: We are not -- we were not -14 JUSTICE ALITO: If we -- you know, if we 15 abandon that, then one of two things has to happen, 16 either the rules for noncapital cases have to change 17 dramatically, or the rules for capital cases have to 18 change dramatically, unless death is different, in fact. 19 MR. GOWDY: Well, I -- first, we -- we are 20 not asking that the procedural rules in the intricate 21 individualized death penalty sentencing scheme be 22 transported or moved over to the noncapital cases. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: I know you are not 24 asking for that, but that -- isn't that where this, 25 logically, is going? If death is not different, then
53 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 there should be uniform rules across the board. 2 MR. GOWDY: Absolutely not, Your Honor, 3 because those rules make no sense when you are talking 4 about adolescents, who are different, because those -5 which a Court recognized in Roper, that those rules 6 can't be applied to adolescents because we -- you can't, 7 as a sentencer, predict the future. 8 And so, though death is different, it's not 9 different in any critical respects here because the 10 punishment, life without parole, just like death, says 11 that the offender is forever irredeemable, is forever 12 unfit to live in society, and must die in prison. 13 JUSTICE ALITO: Why does it say that? Why 14 doesn't it just say that, in this particular case, what 15 this individual has done is so bad that, even if this 16 person can be rehabilitated and would not present a 17 danger to -- to society at age 60 or 70, that this 18 person is -- should be sentenced to life without parole? 19 That's -- that's what it means for an adult offender. 20 MR. GOWDY: Your -- Your Honor, I think the 21 only difference here is -- between life without parole 22 and life with parole, is that there will be a 23 determination later, at age 30 or 40 or sometime 24 thereafter, as to whether that is the right sentence. 25 And the -- the parole official, just like
54 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the judge, can consider the offense as the offender, as 2 a juvenile. We're just saying that you can't make that 3 complete determination at such a young age, and -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One reason States -5 MR. GOWDY: -- and you will have a more 6 accurate determination later. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One reason States 8 and the Federal government moved to abolish parole in -9 in recent decades was, with depressing regularity, 10 prisoners released on parole committed crimes again. 11 And I'm just -- is there any empirical 12 evidence that tells us how often people, say, from 17 -13 17-year-olds, when released, commit crimes again, as 14 opposed to 18- to 20-year-olds? 15 MR. GOWDY: Your Honor, as my brother noted, 16 I think that the evidence shows that, as people get 17 older, they are less likely to recommit crimes. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But isn't that -- I 19 remember some of those studies that -- I mean, the 20 cutoff, there's sort of a magic age at some point, 21 where people over the age of 35, or whatever, typically 22 don't engage in violent activity. 23 MR. GOWDY: It -- it decreases over time, 24 undoubtedly, and that's -- that supports, I think, our 25 argument here, that the -- that Terrance Graham, at age
55 Alderson Reporting Company

1 47, will not be the person he was at age 17. 2 I see my time is up. I'll sit down. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 4 The case is submitted. 5 (Whereupon, at 10:59 a.m., the case in the 6 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
