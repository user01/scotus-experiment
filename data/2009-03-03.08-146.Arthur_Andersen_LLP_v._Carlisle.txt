1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:19 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in Case 08-146, Arthur Andersen v. Carlisle. 5 Mr. Baker. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. MILLER BAKER 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 8 MR. BAKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 9 please the Court: 10 The principal question before the Court 11 today is whether nonparties to an arbitration agreement 12 that are otherwise entitled to enforce that agreement 13 under State law are foreclosed as a matter of law from 14 seeking relief under section 3 of the Federal 15 Arbitration Act. 16 Respondents' argument that section 3 17 forecloses such relief to nonparties is contrary to both 18 the text of section 3 and the structure of the FAA. 19 Nothing in the text of section 3 forecloses nonparty 20 enforcement rights, and under the structure of the Act 21 section 3 is a procedural device to enforce, rather than 22 a substantive limitation upon, State law arbitration 23 rights made applicable by section 2. 24 I'll begin with the text of section 3. 25 Under section 3, a stay is mandatory if the issue in
3

1 suit is, quote, "referable to arbitration under such an 2 agreement." We contend that there are three elements 3 that determine whether or not an issue is referable to 4 arbitration under the agreement. First, the applicant 5 must be able to enforce the agreement. Second, the 6 plaintiff must be bound by the agreement. And, third, 7 the claim must fall within the scope of the agreement. 8 Nothing in section 3 limits who can enforce 9 the agreement. To answer that question we have to turn 10 to section 2. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you leave the 12 text, it says as you -- "referable to arbitration under 13 an agreement," but then it says "shall on application of 14 one of the parties." How do we know whether that is 15 parties to the litigation or parties to the arbitration 16 agreement? 17 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, it's -- it's clear 18 from the -- from the context it's referring to parties 19 to the action. Likewise, in section 4 there's a 20 reference to parties, and it's parties to the 21 controversy. So section 3 refers to parties to the 22 action in which the section 3 stay is sought. Section 23 4, likewise, the companion enforcement provision, refers 24 to parties to the controversy. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what -- what is
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the "controversy"? Is it the controversy asserted to be 2 subject to arbitration or something else? 3 MR. BAKER: Well, "controversy" is in -- in 4 section 4, Your Honor, as opposed to section 3. But the 5 controversy in this case is a tort claim against various 6 defendants. And that -- the Petitioners in this case 7 assert that they are entitled to enforce the arbitration 8 clause, and under that clause this controversy is 9 supposed to be arbitrated. 10 Now, section 2 is the primary substantive 11 provision of the Act. Section 2 establishes that 12 questions concerning the enforceability of an 13 arbitration agreement, including who may enforce that 14 agreement, are decided by State law. This Court's 15 decision in Perry v. Thomas recognized and applied this 16 principle. 17 In Perry this Court remanded to State court 18 to decide the question of whether nonparties could 19 enforce an arbitration agreement. In so doing, this 20 Court instructed the lower court to apply State law to 21 determine the very question that's before this case, 22 whether non -- before this Court, whether nonparties 23 could enforce the arbitration agreement. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In practice, are there 25 decisions in which -- and I'm assuming that you are
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 right on the jurisdictional question -- in which a 2 nonparty to the arbitration agreement but a party to the 3 litigation has, in fact, succeeded in getting a stay 4 under section 3? 5 I mean, one question is -- and that's the 6 question on the merits -- assuming that a -- that a 7 party to the litigation, not a party to the arbitration 8 agreement, can come to court and say, court, stay the 9 action pending arbitration. Have there been cases in 10 which section 3 stays have been issued on the request of 11 someone who is not party to the arbitration agreement 12 but is a litigant in the case? 13 MR. BAKER: Yes, there have been, Your 14 Honor. And there -- there are numerous cases. In fact, 15 for the last 60 years it has been a recognized, settled 16 principle of FAA law that nonparties to an arbitration 17 agreement that are otherwise entitled to enforce the 18 agreement are able to seek and obtain stays under 19 section 3. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the question -21 ability is one thing. It means they -- they have the 22 capacity to apply under section 3. I was just wondering 23 how in practice -- I mean, here's a case where you have 24 three parties together counseling a certain tax shelter. 25 One of them enters an arbitration agreement with the
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 enterprise that they are advising. The other two, 2 sophisticated players, do not. 3 My question is, conceding jurisdiction, it 4 seems to me unlikely that a court would listen to two 5 such people who were perfectly equipped to get an 6 arbitration agreement themselves and didn't. 7 MR. BAKER: Well, Your Honor, it depends 8 upon the facts and the law. It may well be that those 9 nonparties have no arbitration rights, in which case a 10 section 3 stay would not be available -- available to 11 them. 12 The question is whether they have rights 13 under State law. If they do have rights under State law 14 to enforce the arbitration agreement to which they are 15 not parties, then they are entitled to a section 3 stay. 16 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I don't see that the 17 -- that the section 3 stay follows from that. It may 18 very well be that in whatever ultimate forum the case is 19 thrashed out in that the -- that the nonsignatories will 20 be able to enforce the arbitration agreement. 21 The question here is whether they can get a 22 stay in midstream in order to litigate that as a 23 separate issue. And one argument for saying that they 24 should not, that the stay right should be limited to 25 signatories, is that the policy of the -- the Federal
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Arbitration Act is to enforce arbitration agreements. 2 It is not a policy simply to promote arbitration under 3 all possible circumstances. It is a policy to enforce 4 contracts because the contracts, in effect, were being 5 given short shrift before the act was passed. 6 If the policy is one to enforce contracts 7 and, as Justice Ginsburg said, they had a chance to make 8 an arbitration agreement and they didn't do it, then 9 that is a good reason to say the Federal courts will not 10 stay the proceedings in midstream for somebody who 11 didn't get the agreement that that person could have 12 gotten. What is your answer to that argument? 13 MR. BAKER: Section 2, Your Honor, sets the 14 policy of the FAA, and section 2 establishes that State 15 law determines the rights and obligations of nonparties 16 to an arbitration agreement. If nonparties have rights 17 -18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Including -- and -- and 19 you're saying that that covers, in effect, even a point 20 of Federal procedure as to whether you get, in practical 21 terms, an interlocutory appeal. That's a question of 22 State law? 23 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, that brings us to 24 the question of appellate jurisdiction, but first let me 25 deal with the merits. Section 3, as this Court has
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 recognized on various occasions, is a procedural device 2 to enforce the substantive policy of section 2. It has 3 no substantive component on its own. 4 Section 2 establishes -- settles the 5 question of who may enforce or is bound by an 6 arbitration agreement. It settles that question by 7 directing a court to look to State law. Section 3 is -8 JUSTICE SOUTER: And the question here is: 9 What is the procedure to be followed in a Federal court 10 when there is disagreement about that? And to say that 11 that is a question of State law strikes me as a stretch. 12 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, section 3 is a 13 procedural device to enforce State law arbitration 14 rights. Section -- likewise, section 4 is the same 15 thing. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say that section 17 2 -- it isn't at all clear to me that section 2 says 18 State law determines whether somebody not a party to the 19 arbitration agreement can -- can enforce it. 20 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, that was the reading 21 of this Court in the Perry v. Thomas decision in 1987. 22 This Court construed section 2 as being a touchstone for 23 choice of law and that section 2 required the court 24 concerning questions concerning the enforceability of an 25 arbitration agreement to look to State law to answer
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 those questions. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Including enforceability by 3 whom? 4 MR. BAKER: Absolutely. That was the 5 precise question before the court in Perry and this 6 Court remanded to the California Court of Appeals to 7 determine whether nonsignatories to an arbitration 8 agreement could enforce that agreement. The California 9 Court of Appeals on remand held that they could under a 10 theory of agency, which is indistinguishable in 11 principle from the theory that Petitioners are asserting 12 here today. 13 Respondents' theory, their interpretation of 14 the Federal Arbitration Act, would wipe out six decades 15 of FAA case law recognizing that nonparties have 16 enforcement rights. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have any 18 situation -- and this one is really peculiar because the 19 one party who has the arbitration agreement with 20 Carlisle is now out of it, and is not going to get back 21 in, because -- is it Bricolage -- is bankrupt, so there 22 is an automatic stay of any litigation against 23 Bricolage. 24 The one party that has the arbitration 25 agreement is out of the picture, so you have an
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 arbitration agreement effectively with no one, that two 2 parties who have no arbitration agreement are trying to 3 enforce: The difference between parties to the 4 litigation joining in an ongoing arbitration brought by 5 either party to the arbitration agreement, and relying 6 on an arbitration agreement effectively without two 7 parties to it. 8 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, the bankruptcy of 9 Bricolage has no effect whatsoever on our rights under 10 State law to enforce the agreement. It is what it is, 11 but -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you have a party 13 to the agreement who is no longer in the picture, 14 doesn't that change things? 15 MR. BAKER: Well, the Respondents might -16 might contend so, and they -- they are free to argue on 17 remand the question of whether or not that bankruptcy in 18 any way affects our rights, whether we can prevail under 19 equitable estoppel in this case. But for purposes of 20 this Court, the question that we -- that the Court has 21 to decide is whether or not as a matter of law a 22 nonparty is foreclosed from seeking relief under section 23 3, and section 3 does not foreclose such relief because 24 section 2 establishes the principle that this -- that a 25 court is to look to State law to determine the question
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of who can enforce an arbitration agreement. 2 So we're saying that Respondents' theory of 3 the case would wipe out 60 years of FAA case law 4 recognizing that nonparties have arbitration rights. 5 Theories such as third party beneficiary, assignment, 6 agency, estoppel, including equitable estoppel, 7 assumption, successor in interest, none of those cases 8 can survive effectively if this Court were to affirm the 9 decision of the Sixth Circuit. 10 I will now turn to section 16 and the 11 question of appellate jurisdiction. Respondents, like 12 the court below, erroneously conflate the merits of the 13 section 3 issue with appellate jurisdiction. Thus if 14 you reject their interpretation of section 3, 15 necessarily their appellate jurisdiction argument fails. 16 But that -- their theory of appellate jurisdiction 17 nevertheless should be rejected on its own merits. 18 Under section 16, and that's found at page 3 19 of the blue brief -- an appeal may be taken from an 20 order refusing a stay of any action under this title. 21 This establishes a broad category of orders that are 22 immediately appealable. The Sixth Circuit below used a 23 signatory test to determine whether it had appellate 24 jurisdiction. Now, this test is legally erroneous, as 25 the Respondents concede. For 70 years -- should be 80
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 years -- the Federal Arbitration Act has been understood 2 not to contain a signatory requirement. 3 JUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I ask you this? 4 Let's assume State law said we -- we don't recognize 5 stays at this stage of the game. Therefore, we will not 6 give a stay to anyone. Would State law prevail? 7 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, State law controls 8 the question of who may enforce the agreement, who has 9 rights and obligations under the agreement. Sections 3 10 and 4 control the question of whether relief is 11 available in Federal court. The procedural devices to 12 enforce State law arbitration rights may vary from State 13 to Federal Court, but the principle of who -14 JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't that the problem? 15 That's what I'm getting at. Isn't that the problem for 16 you in this case? Because you keep arguing that their 17 substantive rights under the agreement are issues of 18 State law, but the question before us is not one of 19 ultimate substantive right. At some point there will be 20 an -- an appellate process open to them and they can 21 assert those substantive rights if they didn't get them 22 at trial. 23 The issue here is not substantive right. 24 The issue here is a procedural right, and it's a 25 procedural right which depends upon the terms of the
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Federal statute, and that's why it seems to me that it 2 may very well be that the Federal statute determines not 3 only the procedural right, the stay, but who may ask for 4 it, that being a sensible Federal question rather than a 5 State question. 6 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, the premise of your 7 question drives a wedge between section 2 and section 3 8 that is inconsistent with this Court's -- Court's 9 decision in Bernhardt. This Court in Bernhardt said 10 that section 3 cannot be read apart from section 2. 11 Section -- this Court has never characterized section 3 12 or section 4 as containing any substantive elements. 13 Such -14 JUSTICE SOUTER: And your argument depends 15 upon, as Justice Scalia pointed out a moment ago, 16 reading section 2 as in effect incorporating State law 17 for purposes of determining substantive rights. 18 MR. BAKER: It absolutely does. 19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but that still begs 20 the question whether the -- whether the incorporation of 21 State law to determine substantive rights controls the 22 question of what law determines procedural rights, when 23 a Federal procedural right is claimed, which is what is 24 involved here. 25 MR. BAKER: That's -- that's correct. And
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 sections -- it is a Federal question as to what sections 2 3 and 4 require. 3 JUSTICE SOUTER: And regardless of State law 4 the answer to the Federal question is independent of it. 5 MR. BAKER: That's not correct, Your Honor. 6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then I'm -- I'm missing the 7 logic of your argument. 8 MR. BAKER: The logic of the argument is 9 that section 3 and section 4, as this Court has said on 10 several occasions, are devices to enforce the principle 11 of arbitration enforceability outlined in section 2. 12 Section 2 establishes the substantive principle here. 13 Sections 3 and 4 are mere procedural devices. Under -14 JUSTICE SOUTER: But they are Federal 15 procedural devices and State law could not contradict 16 them. That's -- that's what we got into when I said 17 what if State law said there could be no stay? You 18 agree at that point that of course the Federal law would 19 prevail? 20 MR. BAKER: That would apply to -- that 21 would apply to the question of the -- the action in that 22 court, but in the Federal court the threshold -23 JUSTICE SOUTER: It would apply to what the 24 judge is supposed to do at that moment when somebody 25 says, I want a stay. And the judge at that point
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 consults Federal law, not State law, doesn't he? 2 MR. BAKER: That -- on the procedural 3 question of what procedural mechanism -4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, just stick to my 5 question. He says: I want a stay. Does the judge look 6 to State law or Federal law? 7 MR. BAKER: The judge first looks to the 8 question of who can enforce the agreement, and to ask 9 that -- to answer that question, the judge has to look 10 to State law. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: Why is that necessarily so? 12 I don't understand your answer to that question, or your 13 statement that your argument is dependent on the 14 resolution of that choice of law issue. 15 Are the courts of appeals unanimous on the 16 question of whether the enforceability of an arbitration 17 agreement by a nonparty is a question of State law? I 18 think there's at least a Fourth Circuit decision that 19 says it's a question of Federal law, but why -- why do 20 we have to decide that and why is your argument 21 dependent on it? 22 Suppose that is, suppose that were a 23 question of Federal law, what would that -- it might 24 change the ultimate outcome of whether there's an 25 entitlement to a stay, but I don't see why it has any
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 effect on a question of whether there is jurisdiction. 2 MR. BAKER: I don't think it has any 3 question -- effect on the question of jurisdiction, Your 4 Honor. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: Nor does it mean that you 6 necessarily cannot enforce the arbitration agreement, 7 does it? 8 MR. BAKER: It means that -- well, you have 9 to look to a source of law to determine whether a 10 nonparty has rights under an arbitration agreement. I'm 11 aware of that Fourth Circuit case. Your Honor, I 12 believe that the court was incorrect. I believe this 13 Court's decisions in Perry and ensuing cases make it 14 clear that State law determines the rights and 15 obligations of nonparties to an arbitration agreement. 16 That's a settled principle. And so that is a threshold 17 question that has to be -18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you read section 19 3, if you interpret, as you do, the word "parties" to 20 mean parties to the litigation, then for purposes of 21 jurisdiction the only thing is, is this person a party 22 to the litigation? Yes. End of case; they can move for 23 a stay. Then whether they're entitled to one because of 24 this equitable estoppel theory which is determined by 25 the State law is a merits question.
17

1 You are making a more complex jurisdictional 2 argument than I understand. What's wrong with the 3 simple argument that section 3 says parties; that means 4 parties to the litigation; the -- the Petitioners here 5 are parties to the litigation. Therefore, they can move 6 for a stay of the arbitration. And then we go to the 7 merits and say, do they have a good reason for staying 8 the arbitration? 9 But you're presenting a more complex 10 argument on the jurisdictional point which I don't quite 11 understand. 12 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I'm not sure I 13 understand the question. Are you referring to appellate 14 jurisdiction or jurisdiction under the FAA? 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: First, is there 16 jurisdiction -- yes, appellate jurisdiction. If you -17 if there's an application to stay, is that appealable? 18 Why isn't -- why isn't the answer clearly yes? 19 MR. BAKER: The answer, Your Honor, is 20 clearly yes. If we're talking about -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your step -- you seem 22 to be involving some merits question of State law in 23 that question. 24 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I turned to the 25 merits first because the Sixth Circuit below erroneously
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 conflated two entirely distinct concepts. The first is 2 appellate -3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You shouldn't do that. 4 You should tell us, this is the jurisdictional argument. 5 If we pass that threshold, then we get to the merits. 6 MR. BAKER: All right. Well, I'll start 7 with jurisdiction, Your Honor. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Good. 9 (Laughter.) 10 MR. BAKER: All right. Section 16 makes it 11 clear that all one needs to have for appellate 12 jurisdiction is a motion under section 3 for a stay 13 pending appeal, and that is denied. That establishes a 14 broad category of orders. The Sixth Circuit didn't 15 apply that text. The Sixth Circuit used a -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask -- may I ask? 17 Suppose it's somebody who has interest in the litigation 18 but is not a party either to the arbitration agreement 19 or to the litigation? 20 MR. BAKER: If a -- if a party -- if a 21 litigant makes a section 3 stay and they claim no right 22 to enforce the arbitration agreement, that denial of 23 that stay would be appealable, all right, because 24 section 16 -25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking of somebody
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 who is not a litigant, who can -- if somebody who is an 2 interested spectator moves for a stay of litigation to 3 which that person is not a party, and the court says of 4 course not. Would that be reviewable on appeal? 5 MR. BAKER: No, because they -- the 6 spectator is not even a party, Your Honor, to the 7 litigation. Section 3 contemplates parties to the 8 litigation seeking a stay. 9 On the question of appellate jurisdiction, 10 if a litigant makes a request for a section 3 stay and 11 the stay request is denied, there is clearly appellate 12 jurisdiction under section 16. That is -- in our view. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's your 14 jurisdictional argument. 15 MR. BAKER: That's our jurisdictional 16 argument. The mere request for relief under section 3 17 and the denial of that request triggers appellate 18 jurisdiction. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you're saying that's 20 all that's before us because it was thrown out -21 MR. BAKER: That's not all that's before 22 you. The Sixth Circuit below conflated the question of 23 whether there's appellate jurisdiction with whether non24 signatories can seek relief under section 3. That's why 25 it's essential for the Court to reach the second
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 questioned presented, which is whether non-signatories 2 as a matter of law are foreclosed from seeking relief 3 under section 3. 4 The court below -- I'll turn back to 5 appellate jurisdiction to -- Your Honor. The court 6 below used a fact-based test; that is, is the party 7 seeking relief a signatory to the agreement? That -8 that cannot be the law. Eighty years of FAA law 9 establishes that you don't have to be a signatory to 10 enforce an arbitration agreement. In addition, it 11 violates this Court's rule that you look to categories 12 of orders, rather than the facts of a given case in some 13 appellate jurisdictions. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: What are the instances in 15 which somebody who is not a signatory might seem to have 16 a right to enforce it? I can think of one. Suppose 17 he's a third-party beneficiary of the contract. Are 18 there others? 19 MR. BAKER: Well, absolutely, Your Honor. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: What? 21 MR. BAKER: There's assignment, successor in 22 interest, assumption, estoppel. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 24 MR. BAKER: There's a whole -25 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, which one applies

BAKER: More precisely, it's equitable 11 estoppel, but the -- the practice treatises have entire 12 chapters devoted to -13 JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but I haven't 14 unfortunately had a chance to read all the practice 15 treatises. So could you explain to me quite simply what 16 is the theory of equitable estoppel that allows someone 17 who is not a signatory to an arbitration contract to 18 have it enforced? 19 MR. BAKER: Yes, Your Honor. The theory 20 here is that the Respondents asserted claims of -- of 21 concerted misconduct, of conspiracy against the 22 Petitioners, some of whom were -- one of -- well, none 23 of whom were signatories to the arbitration agreement in 24 Bricolage which did -- was a signatory to the agreement, 25 that claim of concerted misconduct, in our view, where
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the Respondents are relying upon the agreement, that is 2 the agreement that they entered into with Bricolage to 3 -- is a theory upon which they are now seeking relief 4 from us. They are claiming that this contract that 5 contains the arbitration clause was an instrumentality 6 for the fraud that was perpetrated on them. Because of 7 that they are now estopped from seeking, claiming that 8 they are not -- not obligated to arbitrate under the 9 agreement. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, whenever I 11 sign a contract with anybody -- I sign one with Smith, I 12 ask him to buy some wheat, I sell him some wheat, and 13 there's an arbitration clause. And now I sue all kinds 14 of other people, and the contract is part of the 15 lawsuit. Are there many cases like that? Maybe it was 16 a shipper, or something, who they sent the contract to, 17 and he had to figure out what to do on the basis of the 18 contract. Or maybe there was a cousin who told me to go 19 to see Smith in the first place. Maybe -- I don't know. 20 There are a lot of people. So, now all those people 21 have to go to arbitration? 22 Because you're saying whenever I go in and 23 have a contract with X and there's an arbitration 24 clause, then in any future lawsuit where I sue anybody 25 and that contract is an essential part of it, the breach

1 thereof, he could put me in arbitration. Boy, that 2 sounds extreme. I mean, I guess there are -- there'd 3 have to be several treatises on this, but it doesn't 4 sound intuitively sensible. 5 MR. BAKER: Well, Your Honor, we're not 6 saying that that applies in every case. There's more -7 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, okay. That's all I 8 wanted to know is what's the theory in this case. 9 MR. BAKER: The theory of equitable 10 estoppel. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: If that's the theory, I -12 unless I think it always applies, I could just say I 13 don't have to decide about a third-party beneficiary. 14 MR. BAKER: Your Honor -15 JUSTICE BREYER: I just have to decide 16 whether you can enforce it. Now -- so you'd better say 17 some other things. 18 (Laughter.) 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, one of -20 MR. BAKER: Well, Your Honor, give me -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: One of the things you're 22 going to say is that, with all due respect, Justice 23 Breyer, this conflates the merits with the 24 jurisdictional problem, which is exactly the mistake 25 that the court of appeals made. Is that your theory of

BAKER: Your Honor -15 JUSTICE BREYER: Now you're saying, no, we 16 don't. 17 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, the merits -- there 18 are two parts to the merits. The first is whether as a 19 matter of law nonparties are foreclosed from seeking 20 relief under section 3. That -- that is all this Court 21 need decide. That is what the question -22 JUSTICE BREYER: I could just rely on my 23 third-party beneficiary example? 24 MR. BAKER: As an example? Exactly. A 25 third-party beneficiary can enforce an agreement as a

1 matter -- is entitled to enforce -- to use section 3. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: If he can do it under State 3 law? 4 MR. BAKER: If he can do it under State law. 5 Absolutely, Justice Scalia. 6 The question of whether or not we satisfied 7 the requirements of equitable estoppel is not before the 8 Court. That's a question to be decided on remand by the 9 Sixth Circuit. 10 Unless there are any further questions, I'd 11 like to reserve the balance of my time. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 13 Mr. De Marco. 14 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. De MARCO 15 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 16 MR. De MARCO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 17 please the Court: 18 Estoppel is what you invoke when you have no 19 contract to invoke, and this version of equitable 20 estoppel is what you invoke when you have no arbitration 21 agreement to invoke. 22 I want to come to a question that was just 23 asked by Justice Breyer. Section 3 mandates only stays 24 in aid of contract-based arbitration obligations. They 25 are not fungible, these arbitration agreements. They
26

1 cannot just be picked up by anyone and advanced as a 2 ground for arbitration. 3 This court has consistently said, in Volt, 4 for example, at page 478: The FAA does not require 5 parties to arbitrate. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I thought the first 7 issue -- I never got past the first issue. 8 MR. De MARCO: Yes, sir. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: And the first issue was, 10 does he have a right to appeal? And I read the statute, 11 and to me section 16 says yes. He asked for a stay. It 12 was denied, and it says an appeal may be taken from an 13 order refusing a stay. So there's an order refusing a 14 stay; he appealed. Why can't he appeal? 15 MR. De MARCO: Because the stay that he 16 requested was distinctly outside section 3, not as a 17 merits question, but so far outside question -- section 18 3 that we can say he should not -- that the stay was not 19 requested under section 3; it was not denied under 20 section -21 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any -- is there 22 any other example in the law -- I can't think of one -23 where you say this party has so silly an argument, which 24 is really what you're saying -25 MR. De MARCO: Right.

1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- that we don't even let 2 him appeal. 3 MR. De MARCO: Yes. There are -4 JUSTICE BREYER: It seems to me I've gotten 5 a lot of appeals where the appeal, I don't think, is too 6 meritorious, but nonetheless I never heard of saying you 7 can't appeal. 8 MR. De MARCO: Right. There are sort of 9 what I would call the Trojan Horse appeals, where a 10 party actually has moved to compel discovery and they 11 characterized it as an injunction. When that was 12 denied, they said: An injunction was denied; we have 13 the right under 1292(a). The court of appeals is 14 perfectly able to pierce that and say: No, that's a 15 discovery motion; that's outside of the injunctive area. 16 And here why we're saying this, Your Honor, 17 we recognize what they say about the Behrens case. This 18 is an instance where we're asking the Court to, in a 19 sense, pull the veil on these section 3 -20 JUSTICE BREYER: As to that, if you did 21 that, I got your first point. I understand it. I agree 22 with it. 23 As to the second point, you say -- I was 24 surprised because I hadn't quite taken that in -- that 25 we are now supposed to reach what we would call the
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 merits of the appeal. Now, there you just heard your 2 co-counsel say: Look, you don't have to decide whether 3 my equitable theory is good or not. You haven't read 4 the treatises, I have; which is a fair comment. And -5 and all I want you to say is that sometimes, at least, a 6 third party could enforce a contract to arbitration that 7 two others make. 8 The statute doesn't say he can't. The 9 statute doesn't say he has to be the one who signed it. 10 And if you think of a third party beneficiary or an 11 assignment, for example, you would think, of course, 12 there are other people, say an assignee, who could 13 enforce it. 14 MR. De MARCO: Right. And there's a reason 15 why those -- in those cases, the third -- I will call 16 them nonparties were allowed to enforce. Let me preface 17 that by saying not all of those were -- we've heard a 18 lot about State law and Federal law. Not all of those 19 are tightly grounded in Federal law. 20 But take your example of the third party 21 beneficiary, they cite a case called J.P. Morgan in 22 which the woman was incompetent, the agreement with the 23 nursing home was signed as -- on her behalf. I think 24 that's clear in that kind of case that the nonparty is 25 asserting the right through the contract, because of the
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 contract, dependent on the contract. 2 Here, by claiming equitable estoppel not 3 only aren't the Petitioners asserting rights that flow 4 to them from the contract, because they have no 5 contract; they are actually saying -- this is the gist, 6 it gets back to your question, what's the gist of their 7 equitable estoppel theory. It's as we quote in footnote 8 13: The gist of it is that equitable principles prevent 9 Respondents from claiming that they have no obligation 10 to arbitrate with the Petitioners despite the lack of an 11 agreement. 12 Their very theory assumes that what section 13 3 says must exist is absent. Their very theory says we 14 don't have an agreement of our own to assert, and 15 therefore, we need equitable principles to fill the 16 void. Now, where do these equitable principles come 17 from? 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you might say that 19 they haven't stated a claim on which relief can be 20 granted, but that is the merits question. We are 21 supposed to be dealing with the question of whether the 22 denial of the stay -- there was a denial of a stay -- is 23 appealable under section 16. And to decide that 24 question I don't think you get into how meritorious 25 their claim was for the stay.

1 MR. De MARCO: Your Honor, the fact that 2 they have filed a motion, and as I referred to it, the 3 concern that we have, and I think the concern that 4 animated DSMC and Universal when they took up this 5 issue, was the Trojan Horse stay motion. We have to 6 keep in mind not every stay that is filed pending 7 arbitration, a stay pending arbitration is necessarily 8 filed under section 3, because in footnote 23 of Moses 9 H. Cone this Court recognized another kind of stay 10 pending arbitration, and that's a discretionary stay. 11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. And what is the 12 criterion for identifying a section 3 stay? 13 MR. De MARCO: The criterion, Your Honor, is 14 that the right to the stay must be -- the right to -15 the statute speaks in terms of referable to arbitration 16 under an agreement. What does that mean? "Referable to 17 arbitration" is the arbitration obligation. "Under" in 18 that means dependent on, because of. So the 19 arbitrability of it depends on a written agreement. 20 JUSTICE SOUTER: And your -- and your 21 position is that the statute should be so construed that 22 only a signatory to the written agreement has a right to 23 the stay, indeed has a right to request the stay under 24 article 3? 25 MR. De MARCO: Yes.
31
Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: What is your reason for 2 saying that? 3 MR. De MARCO: Just to clarify, the statute 4 being section 3. 5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 6 MR. De MARCO: Yes. The reason for that is 7 this Court has been very clear in its interpretations of 8 the FAA in general. The FAA in general, the Court has 9 said, requires -- does not require parties to arbitrate 10 when they have not agreed to do so. So that sets the 11 standard. If there is no agreement, you cannot force 12 that signatory, which didn't have an agreement with that 13 nonsignatory, to arbitrate. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what do you do with 15 third party beneficiary assignment assumption? 16 MR. De MARCO: All of those examples, 17 Justice Kennedy, in all of those examples the right to 18 enforce the agreement, let's say the right to procure a 19 stay based on the agreement, flows from the intention of 20 the parties to the original agreement. 21 The examples they use -- assignment, they 22 cite a case where there is -- there was an express 23 assignment, and in the assignment the Court said they 24 actually assigned the agreement with the arbitration 25 clause in it to the successor. They cite an assumption
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 case. It was an express signed assumption. Those are 2 all cases of contract-based arbitration. 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in a way that was 4 where one of the parties, without the other party's 5 consent, say assignee, a third party beneficiary. Here 6 in a way it's a fortiori because the party who is 7 objecting, his or its own actions caused the agreement 8 to come into play. That's their theory. 9 MR. De MARCO: Well, let me tease that out a 10 bit. The -- one of the -- the problems in this area, 11 this equitable estoppel that has developed as an ersatz 12 form of equity principle, it is not tied to section 3 13 nor is it tied to State law. It is -- it is perfectly 14 ad hoc, so it's an amorphous concept that we've seen 15 develop over the last -16 JUSTICE BREYER: Your proper -- I see this 17 is actually a pretty difficult question to me, and -18 because it seems to me sometimes they have to be able to 19 enforce it, the assignee, the third party beneficiary. 20 MR. De MARCO: Right. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: And now what I don't know, 22 is what they're doing, it's true that section 3 and all 23 the other sections, they talk about the agreement, but 24 they don't say that the individual who is asking for the 25 stay has to be the same person who signed it, as they
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 couldn't. So how do we know which among all the 2 possible people in the case who hasn't signed it should 3 and should not be able to enforce it? 4 Their argument is look to State law, okay? 5 And your argument is derive some principles yourself. 6 Really. 7 MR. De MARCO: Right. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: And so, so -- is it 9 possible to answer this case by saying he's wrong in 10 thinking you always look to State law. It may depend on 11 what the State law says. So that's the answer to the 12 question. You should have had your appeal. Go appeal, 13 and let the courts below work that out first, knowing 14 that the State law is relevant but not always 15 determinative. Then we'll get some -- we'll get some 16 case law on this and we'll be in a better position to 17 figure out what the right answer is. 18 MR. De MARCO: Justice Breyer, the question 19 of arbitrability does not always depend on State law. 20 In Volt, in first options this Court said sometimes it 21 does, but it does when the issue is, was a contract 22 formed, is a contract valid. How are we going to 23 interpret that contract? 24 Here where equitable estoppel is concerned, 25 that's not the consideration. Therefore, because you
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 can -- you can interpret the contract until the cows 2 come home, you're never going to find the Petitioners in 3 it. So that the question -4 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you see it's a little 5 hard. I can imagine a case where they're sitting in the 6 room drawing up the contract, they put it in the 7 arbitration agreement. There are four other people 8 directly related to the room. The parties look around 9 and say, hey, we have arbitration here, I hope everybody 10 understands everybody is going to have to do this. And 11 they all say, okay, don't worry about it. 12 Now, I would say, hey, maybe they're 13 estopped. And there they're going right through the 14 contract. 15 MR. De MARCO: Right. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: So I hate to write the 17 words "equitable estoppel is never relevant." I would 18 rather write the words "I'm uncertain State law is 19 relevant policy." You know, it's not true that it's 20 always relevant. 21 MR. De MARCO: I think the safest ground is 22 to clear up first this question of how arbitrability is 23 decided. And I think Justice Alito asked the question: 24 Is -- is there unanimity among the courts of appeals. 25 The Fourth Circuit case that I -- I think
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 was mentioned, I believe that's the Bailey case. I 2 don't even think there is unanimity, unfortunately, 3 within the Fifth Circuit. But there -- the -- the 4 better view, I think, that is expressed in the Fourth 5 Circuit case is that when the issue that's pivotal is 6 contract interpretation, arbitrability in that narrow 7 sense, that's State law. When it's not, it's Federal 8 law. 9 And I think that's why you see these 10 equitable estoppel cases not talking at all about State 11 law. It is sort of an ersatz, ad hoc version of Federal 12 equity that's being -13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Why shouldn't the 14 Federal law be even simpler than that? And I -- I 15 proposed one, and -- and probably because I don't 16 understand the law well enough, it may -- may have been 17 simply simplistic. 18 But my suggestion was the -- the issue 19 before us should be construed narrowly as being the 20 question of who can ask for a stay. And the answer to 21 that would be only a person -- or one possible answer to 22 that would be only a person who has signed the 23 arbitration agreement, because the Federal policy is to 24 enforce agreements, not force arbitration. And, 25 therefore, it is sensible as a matter of Federal policy
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to say, we're not going to stop this trial in mid-track 2 for arbitration unless you who are asking for it to be 3 stopped signed an arbitration agreement yourself, and 4 it's that agreement that you're trying to enforce. 5 Now, that is maybe a -- a too simplistic 6 approach, but tell me what's good or bad about that. 7 MR. De MARCO: I think that it's the correct 8 approach to say that we are not talking generically 9 about the enforceability of arbitration agreements. We 10 are talking in the context under section 3 of an 11 existing lawsuit. That one party says, hey, I want to 12 stay this lawsuit. So it is a different enforcement 13 mechanism than -- than the -- than the generic law. 14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. That opens the door 15 to my simplistic theory. Now -16 MR. De MARCO: Yes. 17 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- is it a good theory or a 18 bad theory? 19 MR. De MARCO: It's a good theory because 20 then, once you've opened that door to the -- the ability 21 to ask for a stay, you must ask: Well, what are the 22 ground rules for asking for this stay? 23 And while my friend continuously returns to 24 State law, our point is you don't depart from the terms 25 of section 3 itself, because section 3 itself tells you
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the circumstances under which the mandatory stay 2 provision applies. And those circumstances are only 3 when it is referable to arbitration under a written 4 agreement. 5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But it seems to me 6 that that's not enough, because "under the written 7 agreement" leaves open the question of whether the 8 written agreement can be enforced right here and now by 9 getting a stay only by somebody who signed it or by a 10 third party beneficiary or -- or somebody dependent on 11 the contract plus some other legal theory. 12 My simplistic suggestion was: Keep it 13 simple and simply say the -- "under the agreement" means 14 an agreement signed by you, and the reason we confine it 15 to an agreement signed by you is not because the phrase 16 "under this agreement" tells us that. It doesn't. That 17 leaves the question open. 18 We say it is going to be confined to an 19 agreement signed by you because that's really the -- the 20 nub of the Federal policy. We want to enforce 21 agreements, and we want to confine this extraordinary 22 remedy of a stay to people who went to enough trouble to 23 make -- and I don't know whether that's a good idea or 24 not. And -- I mean it's favorable to you, so it's in 25 your interest to say it's a good idea, but I may be
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 getting into trouble by that. And that's what I want 2 you to tell me. 3 MR. De MARCO: Well, that's consistent with 4 the Federal policy as this Court has expressed that 5 Federal policy. It has -- it has said repeatedly the 6 Federal policy is not a general policy to encourage this 7 form of dispute resolution but, rather, it is to give 8 effect to parties when and if they agree to arbitration. 9 So I agree that that is, and should be, the starting 10 point of the analysis. Is -- and -- and it was 11 expressed in -- in Mitsubishi this way: That -- that 12 the intent of the FAA is to give effect to arbitration 13 agreements, to put them on an equal footing with all 14 other agreements, but not more so. And I believe what 15 -- what Petitioners are asking for is a "more so." 16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. De Marco, can I ask 17 you this question? In section 3 do you agree with his 18 reading of the word "parties," or do you think "parties" 19 just means parties to the contract? 20 MR. De MARCO: With my friend's reading? 21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 22 MR. De MARCO: Justice Stevens, I have to be 23 honest and say I'm concerned about that argument because 24 I think Congress has used the word "parties" throughout 25 the FAA rather haphazardly to mean three different
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 things, maybe four: Party to the agreement, party to 2 the action, party to the arbitration, or party-like 3 person. And I would be concerned about hanging it on -4 on that. So my -- my answer is, because of the way it's 5 used in sections 3, 4, 5, 9, I would be concerned about 6 -- about resting on that. 7 JUSTICE STEVENS: You are concerned about -8 does that mean you agree with him that "parties" means 9 parties to the action and not parties to the contract? 10 MR. De MARCO: I -- actually in section 3 11 what I would say is it's equivocal, and the rest of the 12 FAA doesn't help us understand that. So it's an -- it's 13 an issue on which I would not hang my hat, because it is 14 equivocal. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: What would you think about 16 saying that some parties -- some parties to the case who 17 are not parties to the contract can as third parties, 18 nonetheless, enforce arbitration? We have listed a few 19 examples, assignees, et cetera. When considering 20 whether this is one of them, judge, the key question -21 we can tell you what the key question is and what it 22 isn't. What it is has to do with the intent of the 23 persons who did sign the contract. 24 MR. De MARCO: Right. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Something related to that.
40

1 We don't have to be specific. 2 MR. De MARCO: Right. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: What it isn't is a case 4 management device. Because what I think the temptation 5 would be for the judge is to -- is to -- let's send them 6 all off to arbitration if we can, and then I would not 7 have to worry about this case for a while. And come 8 back, and I'll figure it out. 9 MR. De MARCO: Right. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: So is that -- is that 11 right, or is it wrong? What's your insight or guess on 12 that? 13 MR. De MARCO: I think it's -- it's correct. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm just looking for ways 15 of separating these sheep from goats. 16 MR. De MARCO: Yes. The only way, I think, 17 to give effect to what the Court said, which is nobody 18 is going to be forced to arbitrate when they haven't 19 agreed to arbitrate, is for judges to take section 3 20 seriously when it is proffered as the basis for a stay 21 motion and to -- and to apply it as -22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you just told us 23 that section 3 was ambiguous. You don't know if the 24 reference to "parties" means parties to the arbitration 25 agreement or parties in the litigation. So how can we
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 take it -- we take it seriously, yes, and say there's an 2 ambiguity. We don't know from the text which is the 3 proper reference, parties to the agreement or parties to 4 the litigation. 5 MR. De MARCO: Justice Ginsburg, by 6 declining Justice Stevens's invitation of sorts to read 7 "parties" a particular way, I did not mean to -- to 8 suggest that the referable -- issue referable to 9 arbitration under a written agreement is ambiguous. I 10 don't think that's ambiguous. 11 I think as applied here in this case it's 12 clear that the -- the Petitioners' claim of 13 arbitrability does not flow, to use Justice Breyer's 14 terms, from that which the parties to the Bricolage 15 agreement intended. They don't claim that the parties 16 to that agreement intended for them to be covered, as 17 would be the case with a third-party beneficiary or -18 JUSTICE ALITO: If the "parties" in -- in 19 section 3 means parties to the arbitration agreement, 20 would that mean that a -- someone who is not a party to 21 the litigation could file a stay motion under section 3, 22 someone who is not a party to the litigation but is a 23 party to the arbitration agreement? 24 MR. De MARCO: If it were limited to parties 25 to the -- if it were interpreted as parties to the
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 arbitration agreement, then it would suggest that a 2 party outside the litigation -- let's say a party that's 3 conducting an arbitration pursuant to an arbitration 4 agreement could intervene. 5 That's what happened in DSMC. The -- the -6 one of the contracting parties intervened and said, we 7 are engaged in this arbitration. We want you to stop 8 this, what had been claimed to be, nonarbitrable 9 litigation. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, once they intervene, 11 they are a party to the litigation as well. 12 MR. De MARCO: Pardon me? 13 JUSTICE ALITO: Once they intervene they 14 are. 15 MR. De MARCO: There I think it was for the 16 limited purpose of seeking a stay. I -- I take your 17 point, though, that -- I -- I think we have to be 18 careful in -- in judging the -- a stay motion, to focus 19 on the language of section 3 under the under-written 20 agreement language, and when -- when that is the focus, 21 I think it's clear that theories such as equitable 22 estoppel, an outlier among all those theories that were 23 listed, assumption, assignment -- an outlier among 24 them -- uniquely says that despite the lack of a written 25 agreement to arbitrate, equity requires; equity says it
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 should be arbitrated. That -- that I think is 2 incompatible with the language of section 3. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you would recognize 4 that there is some appeal possibility, because you 5 already said or at least you said in your brief that the 6 12 might -- let's get this question settled about the 7 equitable estoppel and going to arbitration; That the 8 district court in its discretion that could give a 9 1292(b) order and say I want to get this issue settled 10 on appeal before I go on with the case. 11 MR. De MARCO: Correct. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would be all right. 13 MR. De MARCO: There is an appellate pathway 14 and that is 1292(b). That has always existed for 15 discretionary stays. I think it applies when a party 16 attempts, perhaps labels its motion a section 3 stay, 17 but misses the mark by not truly grounding it in 18 section 3. When it misses the mark, their outlet -19 their pathway to interlocutory appeal ought to be 20 1292(b), particularly because section 16(b) indicates 21 Congress felt that was a compatible accommodation in the 22 stay -- in the arbitration context. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well -- the district 24 judge could say, I'm going to treat this as a 1292(b) 25 issue, and I'm going to grant the stay so that the court
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of appeals can tell -- can tell me what the law is? 2 MR. De MARCO: That's correct, Justice 3 Ginsburg. I want to be clear that the rule we propose 4 as to these claimants asserting equitable estoppel does 5 not preclude them from seeking a stay, even based on 6 equitable estoppel. And the best example I can give you 7 is one in the D.C. Circuit, in the post-DSMC era. 8 There's a case called Toledano in which the party was 9 asserting exactly the same theory that -- that 10 Petitioners are, equitable estoppel entitles us to a 11 stay. And what the court said there is well, DSMC has 12 come down and said you cannot under section 3 predicate 13 a stay on equitable estoppel, because you are by 14 definition saying I am not subject to a written 15 agreement; that's the predicate for section 3. 16 So what the District Court said in that 17 State -- in that case, it entertained the stay as a 18 discretionary stay, and it granted it. It granted it on 19 the very same ground that my friend is insisting should 20 be the ground for a mandatory stay in the post-DSMC era; 21 it's a basis in the District of Columbia for a 22 discretionary stay. It worked exactly the same way. 23 The difference was you -- you were true to 24 the language of section 3 and you were true to the 25 language of section 16(a)(1)(A); you don't have the
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 runaway stays in the D.C. Circuit that you have in the 2 Fifth Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit and to some 3 extent in the Fourth Circuit; and you don't have the 4 interlocutory appeals from those except under 1292. 5 I want to come back to a -- to a question 6 that was -- that was asked by Justice Ginsburg about 7 Bricolage. If Bricolage were, let's say, back in the 8 picture, or does the fact that Bricolage is out of the 9 picture make a difference? 10 The only sense in which an issue in this 11 case was ever referable to arbitration under an 12 agreement in writing is under the Bricolage agreement. 13 Once Bricolage departed the case, that obligation that 14 Respondents may have had to arbitrate with Bricolage 15 became inoperative, and what I see Petitioners 16 attempting to do is to disaggregate that the obligation 17 that Respondents undertook to arbitrate with Bricolage 18 from Bricolage's reciprocal obligation, detach it, and 19 run away with it as if it's a fungible commodity and say 20 we are now owed this obligation, when -- contrary to 21 everything this Court has ever said. 22 That's not the way the FAA works, because 23 with the FAA the starting point as this Court said in 24 Mitsubishi is did the parties agree to arbitrate that 25 dispute? And if we're talking about the -- the absence
46
Alderson Reporting Company

1 of Bricolage, I think we're -- we're dealing with a case 2 where even among the equitable estoppel cases, this case 3 will turn out to be an outlier because of Bricolage's 4 absence. 5 I say that because we're also dealing with 6 accountants who were their accountants for 25 years 7 before Bricolage came along. We're dealing with a law 8 firm that had a written retention agreement, had a 9 contract with them and didn't think to put it in that 10 contract, saying, "oh, pay no attention to that, let me 11 show you this contract that they signed with someone 12 else." 13 It gets back to Justice Breyer's point: If 14 I -- let's say I unilaterally published in The 15 Washington Post, "I am through with litigation, 16 henceforth I will arbitrate every dispute with every 17 other human being that I get involved in." That's not a 18 section 3 agreement to arbitrate. 19 Agreement imports the notion of an exchange 20 of arbitration obligations, which we do not have here. 21 Bricolage is gone. There's no question that the premise 22 of this equitable estoppel argument is the absence of a 23 -- of an agreement to arbitrate should be overlooked 24 because of equity. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Bricolage did move to

1 compel, it did move for a stay, did make a section 3 2 application; and then it -- it became bankrupt and got 3 the benefit of the automatic stay in bankruptcy. 4 MR. De MARCO: Right. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I take it that 6 Andersen and Curtis are saying we have a right to be 7 substituted for Bricolage. That's -8 MR. De MARCO: That's what their -- that's 9 apparently their argument, and the problem is how do 10 they fill that gap. They attempt to fill it with State 11 law. I think State law does not apply, the language of 12 section 3 applies, Your Honor, and section 3 cannot get 13 them there from here. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 15 Mr. De Marco. 16 Mr. Baker, you have four minutes remaining. 17 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF M. MILLER BAKER 18 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 19 MR. BAKER: Thank you, Your Honor. 20 The question of appellate jurisdiction, the 21 Petitioners here made a motion for relief under section 22 3, and that motion was denied. Therefore there is 23 jurisdiction under section 16 to reach the question of 24 whether we were entitled to relief under section 3. 25 Respondents have made a very important
48

1 concession that decides this case. Respondents concede 2 that under section 3 nonparties can enforce an 3 arbitration agreement through the mechanism of section 4 3. That decides this case. This case should be 5 remanded to the Court of Appeals to decide the question 6 of whether on these facts, these nonparty Petitioners 7 can actually enforce section 3. 8 The Petitioners' quarrel is with the 9 doctrine of equitable estoppel. They don't like it, but 10 there's nothing in the text of section 3 that allows 11 this Court or any court to distinguish between the 12 various doctrines or legal theories that nonparties may 13 seek to which -- to enforce section 3. We happen to 14 have used section 3, happen to have invoked equitable 15 estoppel as the basis for invoking section 3, but it 16 could have been assigned and it could have been a third 17 party beneficiary. 18 They have -- Respondents have conceded the 19 principle that section 3 is available to provide relief 20 on nonparties who are otherwise entitled to enforce the 21 agreement. They just think that on the merits we don't 22 satisfy the requirements of equitable estoppel. That's 23 a question to be decided on remand. Equitable estoppel, 24 I will say very briefly, presupposes the existence of a 25 written arbitration agreement. In the absence of a
49

1 written arbitration agreement, Petitioners here would 2 not have any ability to assert this theory of equitable 3 estoppel. So -- so it's not completely separated from 4 or detached from the existence of a written arbitration 5 agreement. 6 I would like to turn to Justice Souter's 7 signatory test for allowing relief under section 3. 8 With all respect, this defies 80 years of case law 9 interpreting the Federal Arbitration Act. It defies the 10 history of the Federal Arbitration Act. It's settled 11 that Congress in enacting this Act, chose New York law, 12 and the New York arbitration act lad a much more 13 stringent requirement for arbitrating existing disputes 14 which required a signature. 15 Congress, as we outlined in our brief, did 16 not choose that section of the New York law as a model 17 when it enacted the FAA in 1925. 1292(b), the right to 18 appellate jurisdiction is illusory because that is 19 denied; a nonparty with arbitration rights be forced to 20 litigate and lose the very things that arbitration is 21 designed to avoid -- that is, the cost and time of being 22 in litigation in a district court. Not only that, the 23 District Court will suffer the loss of judicial 24 efficiency by having to litigate -- litigate a case 25 before it or adjudicate a case that should be in

1 arbitration. 2 Unless there are any further questions, I 3 will conclude the argument. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 5 The case is submitted. 6 (Whereupon, at 12:19 p.m., the case in the 7 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
