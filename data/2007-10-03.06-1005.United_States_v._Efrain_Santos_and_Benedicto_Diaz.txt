1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in case 06-1005, United States versus Santos. 5 Mr. Roberts. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 9 please the Court: 10 The Seventh Circuit misconstrued the Federal 11 money laundering statute by interpreting the term 12 "proceeds" to mean profits. The statute prohibits the 13 laundering of all the gross receipts of a crime, not 14 just its profits. The primary meaning of "proceeds" is 15 gross receipts, and the statutory context makes clear 16 that's the meaning Congress intended here. The statute 17 is structured to prevent criminals from using the fruits 18 of their crimes to promote or to conceal their illegal 19 activities. But a profits definition of proceeds would 20 constrict the statute in ways that can't be squared with 21 that statutory objective. 22 Because the word "proceeds" appears in 23 the introductory section of the statute, those kinds of 24 restrictions would apply to both concealment and 25 promotion cases.

1 For example, the statute wouldn't cover 2 expense payments that are structured to conceal the 3 unlawful nature and source of the funds involved. That 4 means that if an illegal gambling operator recorded the 5 compensation that he paid his collectors as salary 6 payments by a legitimate business that he owned, that 7 that would not be covered under the statute. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- so what? 9 MR. ROBERTS: Well, Congress was trying -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there some rule up there 11 that says every criminal statute has to cover as much as 12 possible? 13 MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor. That's not 14 what we're arguing. What we're arguing is that there is 15 no reason that Congress wouldn't have covered these 16 transactions and that they implicate the objectives of 17 the statute as revealed by its text, just as much as the 18 transactions that are clearly covered. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it -- I think it 20 much more remarkable than that, more extraordinary than 21 that, that Congress would want to make all -- all 22 betting operations like this a violation automatically 23 of two criminal statutes. 24 MR. ROBERTS: Well, Your Honor -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I find that sort of, you

1 know, very strange. 2 MR. ROBERTS: -- it is certainly true that 3 illegal gambling and money laundering are going to occur 4 together, but that isn't a cause for concern. It just 5 reflects the fact that certain businesses, illegal 6 businesses like gambling operations, like drug dealing, 7 frequently generate large amounts of cash and they need 8 to launder that cash in order to survive and to prosper. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It is hard to see this -10 that, just in the sense of laundering, nothing is being 11 concealed. They're not -- the money that's being paid 12 to the runners and the collectors, it is an ordinary and 13 necessary expense of the illegal business. 14 So I think Justice Scalia was emphasizing 15 that this is, for the very same conduct two discrete 16 statutes, one with much heavier penalties. That makes 17 it odd, too, that the basic gambling statute has a lower 18 penalty than this money laundering statute, and yet it's 19 the same conduct that's violating both. 20 MR. ROBERTS: Well, it's not the same 21 conduct in that the conduct here, the paying the winners 22 and paying the collectors is not a required element of 23 the gambling offense. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh well, I mean -- come on. 25 Nobody -- nobody runs a gambling operation without

1 paying off the winners. It's not going to last very 2 long. 3 MR. ROBERTS: And, true -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: To make the paying off of 5 the winners a separate crime from running the gambling 6 operation seems to me quite extraordinary. 7 MR. ROBERTS: It -- it -- it's true, Your 8 Honor, that they're not going to last very long. 9 They're not going to survive. They're not going to 10 grow. That's because they need to commit money 11 laundering in different ways to do that. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: But even if -13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me what 14 happens if there's a -- two bank robbers, the one's with 15 the get-away car; the other one going into the bank 16 teller, and the robber that goes into the bank gets 17 $1,000 and comes out and gives 500 to the get-away guy. 18 Is that a violation of the statute? 19 MR. ROBERTS: That is, if the -- if the 20 payment would promote the continuing -- if they've got a 21 continuing robbery operation and by paying him he's 22 going to say, he's saying, you know, keep on continuing 23 in the operation and let's expand it further. 24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then under your theory the 25 employee who gets paid shows up for work the next

1 morning; and so, of course, under your theory it would 2 be promotion. 3 MR. ROBERTS: Your Honor, your question and 4 a lot of the questions I'm getting, I think express 5 concern about treating these transactions as promotion 6 under the statute. But the question -7 JUSTICE SOUTER: I would have the same 8 concern if we were dealing with concealment. 9 MR. ROBERTS: What I don't -10 JUSTICE SOUTER: If the robbery takes place 11 in a dark alley, is that automatically concealment? 12 MR. ROBERTS: No, because what needs to be 13 concealed, what there needs to be is a financial 14 transaction that's designed, the transaction itself, to 15 conceal the nature and source of the proceeds. 16 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's going into the alley 17 instead of doing it out on the -18 MR. ROBERTS: I don't think that doing a 19 robbery in the alley would be a financial transaction -20 would be designing a financial transaction to conceal 21 the unlawful nature and source of the proceeds. 22 But if I can give you an example of -23 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Roberts, isn't it true 24 that the problems that are being highlighted are 25 problems that result from expansive interpretations of
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 other concepts that are not before us here, expansive 2 interpretation of promotion, expansive interpretation of 3 concealment? 4 The Seventh Circuit in the first appeal in 5 this case interpreted promotion very broadly. And then, 6 I guess it felt that it had boxed itself in and that's 7 what led to this interpretation of proceeds. But if you 8 interpret those other concepts more narrowly, you don't 9 have the same kind of overlap. 10 MR. ROBERTS: I agree with that, Your Honor. 11 I was going to try to say to Justice Souter's question 12 before that if you have concerns that these kind of 13 expense payments should not be treated as promotional 14 money laundering, the way to address those is not by 15 adopting a profit construction of proceeds, because that 16 would do tremendous violence to the statute in other 17 ways. 18 And I do think that there are -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the 20 qualification that Judge Easterbrook made when he said, 21 at least where the crime is a business-like operation? 22 He gave the example of gambling, he gave the example of 23 selling contraband. 24 And it seems to me that he was narrowing his 25 definition of proceeds to cases where the crime is not
8

1 robbery or a one-time event, but a business-like 2 operation. 3 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think it's difficult 4 to interpret the proceeds, the term "proceeds," to mean 5 something different for business operations than for 6 other crimes because it's the same word. But even so, 7 Your Honor, there are other ways -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you 9 continue. I'm sorry. I didn't know you weren't done. 10 MR. ROBERTS: Okay. I'm sorry. 11 Even so, there are other ways in which a 12 profits definition just makes no sense under this 13 statute, besides the numerous concealment transactions 14 that would be excluded that Congress would have no 15 reason not to cover. It also would make no sense as 16 applied to professional money launderers. Those are 17 people who are hiding money for criminals as a matter of 18 their business. Because they wouldn't be guilty of 19 money laundering, even if they knew that they were 20 concealing money that was generated by a Federal felony, 21 unless they also knew that the money was profits. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 23 answer to the line of questioning that we were having 24 was that the problem would still be there, even if you 25 limited this statute to profits. You take the two bank
9

Alderson Reporting Company

1 robbers in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, the one that 2 robs the bank, the other in the get-away car. If before 3 the robber gave the money to the person in the get-away 4 car, he said, now, you know, I'm keeping $100 because I 5 had to buy the gun and that was $100, so you only get 6 400, so it's only the profits that they're splitting, 7 you'd have the same problem, wouldn't you? 8 MR. ROBERTS: That's right. That's another 9 point, Your Honor, that a profits definition itself 10 isn't going to solve the problem of where the underlying 11 crime and the money laundering -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: It will solve a lot them. 13 And unless you're willing to come in and say, yes, do it 14 to us, give us a narrower definition of concealment and 15 a narrower definition of what's a transaction, but 16 you're not willing to do that. You're going to stretch 17 that as broadly as you can. 18 MR. ROBERTS: It's not going to -- it's 19 not -- first of all, this case doesn't present the 20 interpretation of promotion and the Court would be free 21 to address that in -22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe the question 23 presented doesn't present it -- 24 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. 25 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I think the facts of
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the case do present it. I mean, it's theoretically 2 possible we could agree with you on the profits issue, 3 but nevertheless say this doesn't fit the promotion. 4 MR. ROBERTS: You certainly could, Your 5 Honor. But that would not be an alternative ground that 6 would be appropriate for you to rule on in this case, 7 because that issue was raised on direct appeal. It was 8 decided against Respondents by the -9 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand all that, but 10 we can still do it if it's perfectly obvious that that's 11 the right way to dispose of the case. 12 MR. ROBERTS: You can obviously address any 13 issue that you want to, Your Honor. But the ordinary 14 rule is that issues that have been decided on direct 15 review shouldn't be relitigated on collateral attack. 16 The issue wasn't addressed by either of the courts below 17 in these collateral proceedings. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't it be -19 MR. ROBERTS: We do submit that it was 20 resolved correctly in this case, because, as the Seventh 21 Circuit held and as all the other courts of appeals have 22 held about promotion, the payments to the winners and 23 the payments to the collectors encourage the continued 24 participation of the collectors and encourage the 25 increased participation by gamblers.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, the Seventh 2 Circuit in this case was following a precedent in 3 another case and it thought that the defendant was would 4 prevail under its theory. 5 If this Court should say that that theory, 6 that it's profits and not proceeds that matter, wouldn't 7 it be appropriate for us, if we don't decide the 8 question ourselves, to remand and say, Seventh Circuit, 9 your precedent was wrong; but you could consider a 10 question that was not necessary for you to reach because 11 you had your precedent on the profits issue? 12 MR. ROBERTS: You could do that, but the 13 question that I think that is concerning the Court was 14 resolved by the Seventh Circuit in this very case on 15 direct appeal. So on direct appeal, the argument was 16 made by Mr. Santos that these transactions can't count 17 as promotional money laundering because they're 18 essential transactions of the business and that they 19 don't promote the carrying on of the business, and the 20 court of appeals rejected those arguments. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: You might well reject it if 22 you're going to have a narrow definition of proceeds. I 23 mean, that rejection was connected with its acceptance 24 of a narrow definition of proceeds. And if you're 25 asking us to obliterate the latter, I don't know why it
12

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 isn't reasonable to send it back to the Seventh Circuit 2 and say, well, you still said the same thing if you came 3 out differently on the proceeds question. 4 MR. ROBERTS: Well, we certainly would 5 prefer that you did that than that you interpreted 6 proceeds to mean profits because of the violence that it 7 would do to the remainder of the statute, Your Honor. 8 I was talking about professional money 9 launderers before and how they wouldn't be guilty of 10 money laundering if they were concealing money that they 11 knew that was generated by a crime. And Congress -12 there's no reason that Congress would have considered 13 those professional money launderers to be less culpable 14 merely because they might be laundering only illicit 15 receipts. 16 And It would be very difficult for the 17 government to prove that professional money launderers 18 knew that they were laundering profits because they 19 haven't participated in the predicate crime. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: I've got that point, but 21 what is your suggestion as to how to deal with what is 22 underlying disturbing me and it seems like a lot of 23 others, if prima facie Congress did not intend that you 24 launder money where the activity is an essential part of 25 the underlying crime itself? And there are three ways
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of dealing with that: 2 One is this gross receipts method, which has 3 the defects you mentioned. 4 The second is a definition of "promotion" 5 which says when you promote a crime that's different 6 from engaging in the crime. 7 And the third is sentencing; because it's a 8 real offense sentencing method and where what you've 9 done is nothing more than the underlying crime, the 10 sentence should be nothing more than the underlying 11 crime. I see three ways to get to the same problem, and 12 you're asking us to decide them piecemeal, yet they're 13 related. What do I do? 14 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think you decide the 15 question presented here and you decide that proceeds 16 means that -- that proceeds means gross receipts, 17 because that's the only meaning that makes sense with 18 the statute. 19 But the sentencing point you make is a very, 20 very good one, Your Honor. And the fact is that the 21 Sentencing Guidelines were changed in 2001 to align the 22 punishment for money laundering when people participate 23 in the underlying crime much more with the punishment 24 level for the underlying crime. 25 And -- you know, in addition, as we know,
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory, and so courts 2 could certainly take into account concern about 3 overlap -4 JUSTICE BREYER: But still your answer 5 leaves me -- and I have no answer to this; I want yours. 6 I want you to see that I'm in -- at risk here as a judge 7 of getting whipsawed, that I first decide this case for 8 you; and the next case, all kinds of arguments appear 9 that I hadn't thought of; and then the third case, 10 again. But if I could have them somehow together, I 11 could look at the least evil way or the most efficient 12 way of achieving the congressional objective. 13 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think that you can't 14 have all of them together, Your Honor, unfortunately. 15 But I do think that we would say that out of the three 16 that you raised, the best way to deal with concerns 17 about this would be in the sentencing context. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I find that extraordinary. 19 You really come in and say yeah, two crimes, assume 20 Congress meant ordinary gambling crime to carry with it 21 this other extraordinarily high penalty for the same 22 activity that involves the gambling, but don't worry 23 about it, we'll even it out in the sentencing. 24 I mean -- that's no way to run a railroad. 25 MR. ROBERTS: It's not -- Your Honor, it's
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 just not exactly the same activity, because people can 2 commit gambling without commit money laundering. They 3 can be guilt of illegal gambling without being guilty of 4 money laundering -5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Straighten that out in the 6 definition of the crime, rather than in the -7 MR. ROBERTS: But they can be -- even under 8 this definition, Your Honor. In this very case there 9 were restaurant and tavern owners that permitted the 10 gambling bets to be taken on their premises because it 11 increased their -- the patronage of their businesses. 12 And they were convicted of participating in illegal 13 gambling operations. They didn't commit money 14 laundering, because they didn't engage in a financial 15 transaction that's not an element of the gambling 16 offense, that involves the proceeds of the offense, and 17 that's intended either to conceal the proceeds -18 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- Mr. Roberts -- that the 19 gambling offense is conducting a gambling business, so 20 it makes it -- it is not just the gambling itself -21 MR. ROBERTS: It is -- but the statute 22 defines what the three -- the statue defines what the 23 three elements of the gambling business are, Your Honor. 24 That it's illegal gambling that's illegal under State 25 law, that involves 5 or more persons, that it has --
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 continues for more than 30 days or has more than $2,000 2 in gross revenues in a day. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: What continues? The 4 business has to continue. You are not engaging in a 5 gambling business if you're not paying off the winners. 6 That's all. That's not a good decent honest gambling 7 business. 8 (Laughter.) 9 MR. ROBERTS: The gambling business -- it 10 might be gambling and fraud, Your Honor. But the 11 gambling business can continue for more than 30 days 12 without having paid the winners if they had a lottery 13 every month, and it was at the end of the month -- they 14 hadn't paid the winners yet, it would have gone for the 15 30 days, in a 31-day month without -- without having 16 paid the winners. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- if your definition 18 of proceeds is problematic, it is something like an 19 abstract question you're asking us to answer. If this 20 -- if we say well, we're not sure this is proceeds but 21 if it is proceeds, it is defined as gross receipts. 22 That's an artificial context in which to 23 address the issue. 24 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. I think that what 25 they're asking you to do is to interpret -- and what the
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Seventh Circuit has done, is to interpret proceeds in a 2 way that makes no sense for the statute in order to deal 3 with these concerns about promotion cases that can be 4 dealt with in the other ways that Justice Breyer raised. 5 And there are really four -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Robert, may I go back 7 to something you said about -- of the options that 8 Justice Breyer mentioned. 9 You said the way to handle it is in 10 sentencing. 11 Santos was sentenced to 60 months on the 12 gambling counts and 210 months on the laundering. You 13 said the statute has been changed. So what would be the 14 sentence under the statute as it now exists? And this 15 is vastly disproportionate. 60 months for gambling, and 16 210 for money laundering. 17 MR. ROBERTS: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I 18 probably should know the answer to what the precise 19 range would be under the guidelines. Now, I don't. But 20 what I do know is before, the way the guidelines worked 21 was that the base offense level for a money laundering 22 crime was not tied to the offense level for the 23 underlying offense. So it was set I think starting at 24 23 for promotional money laundering. 25 But what happened in 2001 is that the
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 commission changed the rules so that when you -- when 2 the money laundering involves the person who 3 participated in the underlying offense and has also done 4 the money laundering, you start with the offense level 5 for the underlying offense and then you make some minor 6 increases depending upon the type and the -7 JUSTICE BREYER: I have it in front of me 8 actually. I was looking at it. And it seems to me what 9 it assumes is that the underlying offense is different 10 from the money laundering. And do you have any 11 rationale at all as to why this individual, if it's true 12 that he did nothing more than engage in the underlying 13 offense, why should he receive one day more than 60 14 months? 15 MR. ROBERTS: Well, because he does engage 16 in something more than what he needs to do to be 17 punished for the underlying offense, and that conduct is 18 -- and that conduct is -- promotes ongoing crime or can 19 conceal ongoing crime in ways that are just what 20 Congress was getting at in the statute. And -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because gambling under the 22 definition has the three elements that do not include 23 paying off the winners. That's what it all represents 24 -25 MR. ROBERTS: Because -- well, that's one
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 thing, but the other thing is, Your Honor, if I could 2 talk about the ways that the proceeds definition just 3 doesn't make sense here. If these expense payments -4 the expense payments for instance, the payment of the 5 salary that Mr. Santos made to Mr. Diaz -- it happens in 6 this very case, although we didn't prosecute it as 7 concealment money laundering -- that he recorded those 8 payments as salary payments by a printing business that 9 he owned. 10 And he's doing that to conceal the activity, 11 to enable it to keep going. And that's just what 12 Congress was trying to get in the statute. Wouldn't be 13 covered under a profits definition. If criminals 14 concealed the gross receipts temporarily until they pay 15 the expenses -- for instance, if a gambling operator 16 takes the money that -- his illicit receipts from the 17 gambling, and he puts it in the bank account of the 18 printing business. And then later he uses it to pay the 19 winning betters, he's doing that to hide it so the 20 gambling operation can keep going. That's what Congress 21 was trying to get at here. That wouldn't be covered. 22 That -- that evades detection just as much 23 as transactions that hide profit. 24 JUSTICE STEVENS: You are saying it would 25 not be covered as money laundering, but nevertheless it
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 would be illegal and be punished as gambling. 2 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, it would, Your Honor. 3 But the conduct, the concealment conduct -4 JUSTICE STEVENS: And everything they've 5 done here would be punished as gambling -6 MR. ROBERTS: -- the concealment conduct is 7 additional conduct, and it is what Congress wanted to 8 get at here, and a profits definition would mean that it 9 is excluded from the statute. 10 And it would exclude the -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you see the problem 12 we have is we're not sure that it is within the statute. 13 So then you're asking us to say how to make the statute 14 work when we don't think the statute's applicable at 15 all. 16 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I guess if you don't 17 think that concealing expense payments should be 18 covered, if you don't think concealing money that is -19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can you imagine running a 20 illegal gambling business and advertising your expenses? 21 I mean, you have got to conceal these -22 MR. ROBERTS: It's not a question of 23 advertising them, Your Honor. It's not a question of 24 advertising them, but it is a question of taking 25 additional conduct to conceal them.
21

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it's not additional 2 conduct. That's the point. 3 MR. ROBERTS: It is additional conduct. He 4 didn't need to record it on the books of the -- on the 5 books of his printing business. 6 JUSTICE SOUTER: What if he puts it in a tin 7 can and buries it in the garden? Is that additional 8 conduct? 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course it is. 10 MR. ROBERTS: It's additional conduct, but 11 it's not designed to conceal the unlawful nature -12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't it? Do you put 13 your salary in tin cans in the garden? 14 MR. ROBERTS: I might like to keep my money 15 in the cookie jar -- and it's perfectly legitimate 16 money, Your Honor -- because I don't want when someone 17 comes into my house that -- for them to steal the cash. 18 JUSTICE SOUTER: I just don't see how you 19 can make the distinction you're making, and therefore I 20 don't see how you can avoid Justice Stevens's problem. 21 MR. ROBERTS: If he takes the money, Your 22 Honor, and he structures his payments to his employees 23 by making them -- or to his suppliers, by making them in 24 $9,000 increments in order to evade transaction 25 reporting requirements, that wouldn't be covered either
22

1 under this interpretation of the statute. 2 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Roberts, isn't it true 3 that the Seventh Circuit's interpretation of proceeds 4 doesn't really solve these problems except in the case 5 of an unprofitable business? In the case of a 6 profitable illegal enterprise, all of the same problems 7 exist. 8 MR. ROBERTS: I think there are many 9 situations, as the Chief Justice pointed out, in which a 10 profits definition isn't going to be enough to solve it. 11 For instance, just a drug dealer accepts payment for the 12 drugs. If that money exceeds the cost of the business, 13 it would presumably be profit and without some other 14 requirement in the statute, it would count as money 15 laundering. And for instance, when street-level dealers 16 that are employed by a drug kingpin turn the receipts 17 over to the kingpin even after they've take out their 18 share, let's say -- under a profits definition if those 19 receipts exceeded the costs of the business that would 20 also be covered as money laundering. So I think it's 21 very true that the profits definition isn't going to 22 solve all the problems as well. 23 That's a -- you know -- another point about 24 it. 25 It also means that what we have to prove
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 profits that that's going to be very difficult for us to 2 do even in cases that don't involve these expense 3 payments because criminals often don't keep accounting 4 records. They certainly don't keep records that are 5 accurate and complete and decipherable by law 6 enforcement. And Congress recognized the lack of hard 7 evidence of criminal profits, and for that reason 8 Congress provided for the forfeiture of proceeds rather 9 than profits in the RICO and drug forfeiture statutes. 10 And there's no reason to think Congress took a different 11 approach here in the money laundering statute, two years 12 later, when it used the same term "proceeds." 13 There's also -- there's the issue of the 14 uncertainty that would be created by a profits 15 definition, because it would raise all these questions, 16 and there are no accounting rules to resolve them. 17 And even the court below acknowledged that 18 it's difficult to determine what is and isn't net 19 income, and that the line between paying expenses and 20 reinvesting that income is murky. 21 And I don't think the Court should lightly 22 assume that Congress intended a definition of an element 23 of the offense that's going to raise these numerous 24 issues about the scope of that essential element of the 25 offense. And the Court is going to have to resolve them

VARE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 10 may it please the Court: 11 Justice Ginsburg, you have suggested 12 correctly that the only conduct in this case was the 13 payment of ordinary and necessary expenses of the 14 business. 15 Justice Scalia, you correctly suggested that 16 paying off winners is necessary to every gambling 17 operation. 18 Justice Breyer, you have correctly suggested 19 and stated that the money laundering statute is intended 20 to punish different conduct, different criminal activity 21 than the underlying criminal activity. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Didn't Justice Alito 23 correctly suggest that these merger problems would still 24 persist even under your definition of "proceeds"? 25 MR. VARE: I think that that is not
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 necessarily true. The merger problems would -- would 2 exist except for the "profits definition," certainly on 3 the facts of these cases -- on this case. 4 On this case the only facts that were 5 presented by the Government -- and they have conceded 6 that they did not present any evidence of profits. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but I mean if 8 you have a "profits" definition and the enterprise has 9 profits, all of these problems we've been talking about 10 in terms of the merger, as I call it, between the money 11 laundering and the underlying offense would still be 12 there, right? 13 MR. VARE: Yes, Your Honor. There would. 14 There would. And, in fact, Justice Alito also correctly 15 suggested that the reason why the Scialabba panel 16 decided the "proceeds" definition is profits was because 17 of the expansive interpretation and application of the 18 other aspects of the statute, and that they were left 19 with essentially no choice. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: So why are you urging us to 21 create two problems, to drag along all of the problems 22 that you object to with -- with interpreting proceeds to 23 include simply covering your expenses? You acknowledge 24 that the problems you point out would continue to exist 25 if we accept your definition.
26

1 On the other hand, I think you have to 2 acknowledge that accepting your definition creates other 3 problems of its own, such as the difficulty in every 4 case of showing that an illegal operation made a profit, 5 such as the difficulty of deciding what kind of criteria 6 you use for determining what are the -- what are the 7 ordinary and necessary expenses of a criminal 8 enterprise. 9 Why should we -- why should we choose to get 10 the worst of both worlds? And why isn't the proper way 11 to attack the difficulty to focus in on what constitutes 12 a transaction and what constitutes concealment -13 something other than the "proceeds" definition? 14 MR. VARE: I think you're absolutely 15 correct, Justice Scalia. And, in fact, in our 16 opposition to the petition for cert in this case, we 17 made this very point as to why this was not the right 18 case to determine all of these issues, and particularly 19 the burdens that have been presented by the government. 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you argue at any point 21 that these were not proceeds? 22 MR. VARE: Yes, Your Honor, we did. 23 Justice Kennedy, in the briefing in the opposition to 24 cert and in our response brief, we have set forth 25 distinct arguments that there are not separate
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 transactions distinct and different from the underlying 2 criminal activity. 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you argue that in the 4 court of appeals? 5 MR. VARE: That was presented as -- that was 6 presented as part of the Febus decision as an argument 7 that those transactions did not constitute distinct and 8 separate transactions from gambling. That was presented 9 in the pro se petition and acknowledged by the 10 government in responding to the pro se petition below. 11 The government acknowledged that the 12 question in Febus, the question in Scialabba, the 13 question in this case on habeas are legally and 14 factually indistinguishable. And I think Justice 15 Stevens has suggested that all of this is inherent in 16 the question presented. 17 A fair -- it is fairly included because to 18 look at the statutory context of the word "proceeds" is 19 necessary for an intelligent resolution of the meaning 20 of that word as well as how it plays throughout the rest 21 of the statute. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: The question is can you 23 violate the statute by financial transactions which -24 have you promoted the crime, when those transactions are 25 no more than part of the crime itself?
28

1 That's basically the question. And I think 2 Justice Kennedy is asking if, in fact, we wanted to 3 reach that question, is this a case in which we could do 4 it, through reargument or in some other way? 5 MR. VARE: I think that that is a question 6 that this Court could resolve on the facts of this case, 7 or -8 JUSTICE BREYER: And was it raised in the 9 court below? 10 MR. VARE: It was -- it was raised in the 11 court below as -- as inherent -- well, it was certainly 12 raised in the Febus, in the direct appeal. 13 It is inherent in the 2255 petition filed 14 pro se by my client, Mr. Santos. It was acknowledged by 15 the government that these issues are not legally or 16 factually distinguishable. 17 And again, it is inherent in the question 18 that's presented. The money laundering statute requires 19 conducting a financial transaction involving the 20 proceeds of the specified unlawful activity with the 21 intent to promote the -22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think it is a 23 stretch so far as the question presented. The question 24 presented is very clear whether or not it is gross 25 receipts or net profits. That's what we're asked to

VARE: Absolutely not, Justice Ginsburg. 5 It is not our question presented, but we do feel that, 6 even in answering that question, whether or not it is 7 net or gross does require looking at the term in 8 context. And -- and the context, we're not looking at a 9 different statute. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I didn't see that 11 you presented -- a separate question presented in your 12 opposition. 13 MR. VARE: We did , Your Honor. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that? 15 MR. VARE: In the -- Mr. Chief Justice -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not at page (ii). 17 MR. VARE: In Mr. Santos' brief. And the 18 question presented there was -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Brief in opposition -20 MR. VARE: The brief in opposition on the 21 very first page. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, but I am looking 23 at the orange one, not the red one. The orange one is 24 what we have before us when we decide whether or not to 25 grant certiorari. And there you don't have a different
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 question presented. 2 MR. VARE: No, we did not -- in the 3 opposition to the cert petition we did not present a 4 different question presented as a question presented. 5 But we did present the argument -6 Mr. Santos did and Mr. Diaz did -- that there were no 7 separate transactions that promoted the carrying on of 8 the specified unlawful activity. Rather, all that the 9 government had presented in this case was merely 10 conducting the illegal gambling business. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we adopt your 12 position, we will have to decide a question like, for 13 example, if the argument is I didn't have any profits 14 because I had to pay $10,000 for a hit man to kill 15 somebody, we would have to have a judicial decision 16 that, yes, paying hit men is the ordinary and necessary 17 business expense in carrying out illegal gambling 18 operations, right? 19 MR. VARE: I think, Mr. Chief Justice, in 20 any case you're going to have to look at what the 21 specified unlawful activity is in the context of a money 22 laundering prosecution, because that is part of the 23 context. 24 And so in this case you have to look at what 25 is the ordinary conduct of an illegal gambling business.

1 And I would suggest that paying off a hit man most 2 likely would not fall into that category. But, 3 certainly, as many of the Justices, including Justice 4 Scalia and Justice Stevens and others have suggested, 5 that when a gambling business pays off its winners, that 6 is inherent -- that is integral -- to conducting a 7 gambling business. It is not -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's take two 9 illegal gambling operations that are identical in every 10 way except that the one pays the runners, you know, $200 11 a week. The other pays the runners $500 a week. And 12 the one that pays $500 doesn't make any profits because 13 he's paying too much to the runners. 14 The first one, the more successful 15 operation, you say, can be prosecuted for money 16 laundering because its has profits. The other one 17 doesn't. So incompetence is rewarded. 18 MR. VARE: No, Mr. Chief Justice. I would 19 say that neither one could be prosecuted for money 20 laundering because in both situations -21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the -22 MR. VARE: -- when in both situations the 23 gambling operator is simply paying off ordinary business 24 expenses. Just the collectors who are part and parcel 25 of running the illegal gambling business, they're one of
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the participants. And that's part of the illegal 2 gambling statute, is that you have to have five or more 3 participants. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm focusing on 5 the question presented -- that was the only question 6 presented when we considered whether to grant certiorari 7 by either of the parties, and that focuses solely on the 8 question of whether "proceeds" is considered gross 9 revenues or profits. 10 MR. VARE: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, what I 11 -- what I believe is the answer to your question is -12 is you cannot look at the term "proceeds" in isolation. 13 And Justice Breyer, you know, suggested that the reason 14 why we're even here today, arguing about what I believe 15 is just absurd and unwarranted results on the facts of 16 this case, is because the courts below -- and the 17 government has proposed expansive interpretations -- the 18 courts below have adopted, in some cases and not others, 19 these expansive interpretations. 20 JUSTICE ALITO: But this doesn't -21 "proceeds" must mean the same thing in every money 22 laundering case, doesn't it? And every money laundering 23 case is not based on a gambling business. There are 24 drug businesses and all sorts of other predicates. 25 MR. VARE: Well --
33
Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE ALITO: Can it mean something 2 different in -- depending on the underlying illegal 3 activity? 4 MR. VARE: I think there is certainly a 5 suggestion, but that this Court itself has made recently 6 in the Duke Energy case, that a term can have multiple 7 meanings, multiple shades of meanings, and that will 8 depend upon the context. So you have to look at the 9 context and the specified unlawful activity is context. 10 Now, I'm not suggesting that we adopt a 11 definition of proceeds as net profits in one case for 12 one unlawful activity or gross profits for another 13 unlawful activity or gross receipts for another one. 14 But the problem that we have presented to us 15 today is due to the piecemeal construction and 16 application of this statute and -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Vare, you know, I'm -18 I'm unwilling to decide the definition of transaction 19 question in the present case because, frankly, I think 20 that's a -- in itself, a very difficult question which 21 we haven't had adequately argued. For example, while I 22 believe, as I've indicated earlier, that paying off the 23 winners is -- is an essential part of a gambling 24 operation, I don't believe that paying off runners 25 necessarily is. You can have a gambling operation
34

1 without runners, can't you? You can -2 MR. VARE: You could have -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: You can -- you can view 4 that as something beyond the mere -- the mere gambling 5 crime. I don't -- I don't think you can view that 6 paying off the winners is beyond the gambling crime, but 7 I do think having a bunch of runners and paying off each 8 of them is not necessarily part of gambling. 9 MR. VARE: Well, you can have a gambling 10 business without runners per se. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. 12 MR. VARE: But you do need, Justice Scalia, 13 you do need five or more participants. And the courts 14 below have defined participants as -- as owners or 15 partners, bartenders, cocktail waitresses, doormen, 16 employees of the business. 17 And if those are qualifying participants to 18 even establish the -- the predicate for an illegal 19 gambling business, then those participants are most 20 likely going to get paid, and if they get paid, then 21 that is simply part of conducting an illegal gambling 22 business. 23 I think the fact -- I mean, the fact that 24 the runner in this case, the bet collector, Mr. Diaz, is 25 probably -- you know, illustrates best the unwarranted
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 result in this case. Mr. Diaz did nothing more in this 2 case than collect wages of about $150 a month or a week, 3 something along those lines, for simply collecting 4 debts, and he was convicted of money laundering and 5 sentenced to 9 years in jail. 6 Mr. Santos, my client, all he did was pay 7 winners and pay those bet collectors to collect debts, 8 and he -- his sentence was nearly quadrupled. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So someone who 10 simply paid off whoever it is that ships in, you know, a 11 ton of heroin, you'd say is not guilty then? Same 12 thing. I mean, you're just paying off the people who 13 engage in the activities that are necessary for the 14 continuation and promotion of the illegal enterprise. 15 MR. VARE: Well, I -- I think in that case, 16 Mr. Chief Justice, I would -- I would suggest it might 17 be an incomplete hypothetical, because simply paying the 18 expenses of a crime or simply buying more drugs is not 19 in and of itself -- and I think the government has 20 conceded that in their opening -- that's not in and of 21 itself money laundering. There has to be a transaction 22 that is conducted with the intent to promote the 23 carrying on or separately a transaction that is designed 24 to conceal the legitimate or the illegitimate source of 25 -- of the funds received.

1 So simply receiving proceeds from an 2 unlawful activity is not enough. And that's clear on 3 the statutory language. You either have to have some 4 promotion element or some concealment element. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: Let me go back to the 6 question of the definition of "proceeds." 7 Isn't it very unlikely that Congress would 8 have wanted -- wanted to adopt the net income definition 9 in light of the legal issues and the problems of proof 10 that that would involve? 11 Let's take the example of an international 12 drug ring that has assets in a foreign country. They 13 may have crops. They may have processing plants, 14 warehouses, trucks, airplanes, et cetera. They ship 15 millions of dollars of drugs into the United States. 16 They get millions of dollars in gross revenue here every 17 year. They hire a professional money launderer to 18 launder the money here. Now, the Government wants to 19 prosecute the money -- the person they hired plus 20 members of the organization. 21 The person they hired may not know and may 22 not care whether the money that was being laundered was 23 profits or not. And how are you going to prove what -24 whether this enterprise was a profitable enterprise or 25 not? They may have -- and they may have enormous gross

1 revenue, but they may have -- they may have enormous 2 expenses overseas. They may have bought a lot of 3 warehouses and equipment. They may have lost a lot of 4 things because they were raided by the government, 5 destroyed the factory, killed the plants. 6 It becomes as impossible situation, and why 7 would Congress ever have adopted a definition like that? 8 MR. VARE: Well, Justice Alito, I don't 9 think it's an impossible situation, number one, and I'll 10 get to that in a second. To address your first 11 question, could Congress have intended this to mean 12 profits knowing that the burdens were so difficult? 13 To answer that question, then you must look 14 at what else Congress intended, and there's no question 15 that Congress intended to punish different conduct than 16 the underlying criminal activity. 17 And then you have to look at what Congress 18 intended to get at when they wanted to fill the gap in 19 criminal law, when they want wanted to punish crimes 20 that were not previously punished. 21 They focused on getting at ill-gotten gains 22 of criminal enterprises. They focused -- and our 23 briefs, you know, set forth the statements that are 24 replete through the debates on the floor, that the 25 Congress was focused on profits of criminal enterprises.

1 Congress was not focused on the unprofitable 2 criminal enterprise because -3 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm sure that's true. They 4 wouldn't be that worried about the unprofitable criminal 5 enterprises because they wouldn't last very long. But 6 there's the -- there still is the problem of proof -7 MR. VARE: Absolutely, Justice Alito. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: -- proving that it's 9 profitable. 10 MR. VARE: And the proof problem -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not just proving that it's 12 profitable; proving that the person laundering it knew 13 that it was profits because that's part of the 14 definition of the crime, that scienter. And how can you 15 prove that the fellow knew that it was profits? He 16 would very rarely know whether it was or wasn't. So he 17 skips off scot-free free of the laundering crime. 18 MR. VARE: Well, Justice Scalia, the intent 19 or the knowledge or the scienter requirement is going to 20 be present. It's going to be a burden on the government 21 to prove, no matter what definition of proceeds is. 22 But in terms of proving profits, the 23 government is able to prove profits in other criminal 24 financial transaction-type cases in a number of ways. 25 They're not limited to a particular accounting method.

And even in -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do they 7 know even what the fiscal year of these enterprises is? 8 I mean let's suppose you have some costs. They have to 9 buy the poppy field or wherever, but, you know, over 3 10 years, they're going to make a lot of money. You're 11 saying you can't prosecute them in year 2? 12 MR. VARE: No, I'm not saying that at all, 13 Mr. Chief Justice, and I think my point would be the 14 government would not even need to look at a fiscal year 15 to prove profits. They would be able to look at a 16 period of time and through their extensive search and 17 seizure efforts -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is the 19 profits may not come in immediately, even though the 20 underlying activity is exactly the same. 21 MR. VARE: That may be the case. They may 22 have a difficult burden of proving profits in the early 23 stages, but most of these prosecutions practically occur 24 after a period of time. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean what -- what's the

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 total stage you look at? Suppose it's profitable 1 2 month and not the next month, and the loss the second 3 month more than undoes the profits of the first month. 4 Can you still prosecute them for the profits in the 5 first month? 6 MR. VARE: Certainly, based upon the profits 7 in the first month. They're not limited to that. I 8 mean -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: One day they could pick 10 then, they have one good day. And they could -11 MR.

VARE: Simply giving money to somebody 6 else does not meet the concealment and disguisement 7 element. I mean, there has to be an effort made to 8 disguise the source of the income as being illegitimate. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Assume that it's proceeds. 10 Assume that they have a money launderer. Under your 11 definition there's still no violation? 12 MR. VARE: I suppose I would say no. And 13 I'm going to explain why I have to say no, and I'm going 14 to give you a medical word. The profits construction is 15 not perfect. There's no question about that. 16 But we're here today because it's the only 17 way to resolve the case that came up to this Court based 18 upon the expansive interpretations of the rest of the 19 money laundering cases. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well that's -- but 21 we don't try to solve every case. We look at particular 22 questions presented. And maybe there's going to be 23 another case coming up in which the issue of how broadly 24 you should construe promotion is, or whether you should 25 have a different definition when the offenses are merged
42

1 or not. And we'll confront that when it gets here. 2 It seems to me that your argument is -3 maybe your best argument, but your argument, anyway, is 4 let's avoid this question because of these other 5 mistakes that have been made, mistakes which are not 6 presented to us on the question on which we granted 7 cert. 8 MR. VARE: I think, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm 9 not asking this Court to avoid any question. What I am 10 saying is that there is a profits construction that if 11 you apply the traditional rules of statutory 12 construction, if you look at the text -- the word 13 itself, "proceeds," does not have a single plain meaning 14 as gross receipts. It is ambiguous. And it has 15 multiple shades of meaning depending upon the context. 16 If you look at the term "proceeds" in 17 context then, then it will depend upon how one is using 18 it. If I were selling a house, and I asked somebody on 19 the street what would be my proceeds from the sale of my 20 house, in that -- and only in that context, some would 21 say it is the gross. Some would say it is the net. 22 Some would say it depends. 23 Well, it depends upon what? It depends upon 24 context. That is included in the question presented. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take this
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 context. 2 There is, if you are going to go with 3 profit, a question of what expenses? That's one of the 4 difficulties of working with a net proceeds, because we 5 don't know what the expenses that you would deduct, and 6 the hit man was given as one example. You said no, not 7 that one. But salaries to the runners, yes. 8 To figure out what would count to come up 9 with a net figure is the least difficult, is it not? 10 MR. VARE: Justice Ginsburg, I think that it 11 is slightly more difficult in the case the government 12 has now, which is really no difficulty at all. I think 13 that it would depend upon the unlawful activity, the 14 specified unlawful activity, what would be the ordinary 15 expenses associated with doing that crime. 16 And lower courts are well equipped and 17 juries are well equipped to hear evidence, direct and 18 circumstantial, and make inferences and decide those 19 issues. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does it have to be the 21 ordinary expense of that? I mean, let's assume the 22 charge is murder, and I happen to use a hit man for the 23 murder. That's proven and whatnot. 24 Why -- you mean, that isn't part of the 25 murder conviction, simply because I could have done it
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 without a hit man, I could have done it myself? 2 MR. VARE: No, I don't think so at all, 3 Justice Scalia. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think paying the hit 5 man would be part of the murder transaction? 6 MR. VARE: Absolutely. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Uh-huh. 8 MR. VARE: But I don't think that that 9 necessarily parlays into whether or not it is money 10 laundering or not. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I understand. 12 MR. VARE: If, for example, the murderer 13 paid the hit man with money to kill somebody and then 14 paid -- you know, used proceeds from the insurance 15 premium that somebody might have been his wife or her 16 husband, and used the proceeds to pay off the money -17 the hit man for the next crime or to reward him or 18 something else, to carry on the business or used the 19 insurance proceeds to conceal where they came from, then 20 I think you could create a hypothetical situation of 21 money laundering. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought it would 23 depend on whether or not the insurance proceeds exceeded 24 how much he had to pay the hit man, right? Let's say 25 he's not doing it to get the insurance money. It just
45
Alderson Reporting Company

1 so happens he had a $50,000 policy on the victim -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: He wanted to kill his wife, 3 right? 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. He just wanted 5 to commit the murder, not get the money. And so he pays 6 the hit man $100,000, he gets the $50,000, and then uses 7 it for all these other activities, you'd say no money 8 laundering, because no profits? 9 MR. VARE: If we assume the expansive 10 interpretations of a transaction promoting the 11 underlying crime that have been presented in this case 12 and then we apply the profits definition, that might not 13 be money laundering. But, the money laundering statute 14 is not designed to cure that evil. That evil is 15 punished and punished severely by the murder statute. 16 It is punished as the underlying crime. 17 And so in this case, Mr. Santos and 18 Mr. Diaz -- or Mr. Santos was punished up to the maximum 19 of five years for running an illegal gambling business. 20 He didn't do anything else other than run a gambling 21 business. 22 And so I think the point is at the end of 23 the day, there are certainly a lot of hypothetical 24 situations that suggest a profits construction might 25 pose some burdens, might not make sense. But if you're
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 going to look at the burdens on the government in terms 2 of construing the term "proceeds," then you also must 3 look at the consequences of accepting the gross receipts 4 construction. And I think at the outset, nearly every 5 justice up here suggested -- well, that turns every 6 illegal gambling business into a money laundering 7 violation. 8 The government has no answer to that. Under 9 their interpretation as applied today, then every 10 illegal gambling operator will be guilty of money 11 laundering. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought their 13 answer was the money laundering statute covers a whole 14 waterfront of activities besides illegal gambling. And 15 the question is, what did Congress intend when they 16 passed the money laundering statute. 17 This is kind of the tail wagging the dog. 18 The tail is, well, it presents these problems when 19 you're talking about gambling operations, but there's a 20 whole rest of the dog area where it doesn't present a 21 problem. 22 MR. VARE: Well, I think what the money 23 laundering statute was intended to do was punish 24 different conduct, separate and distinct from the 25 underlying crime. And that different conduct is
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 inherent in conducting a financial transaction with the 2 intent to promote the carrying on of the unlawful 3 activity. 4 I do not think that you can parse the 5 statutory language and only address the term "proceeds" 6 irrespective of its consequences. 7 In fact, I think the questions directed to 8 me as to the harsh consequences on the government 9 approving profits shows that you have to look at the 10 term "proceeds" in its context. In its context includes 11 not only the burdens on the one hand, but it certainly 12 includes the situation we have here, that every illegal 13 gambling business is automatic money laundering. And 14 that is not what money laundering statute was enacted, 15 it's not what it was written or intended to address. 16 Thank you. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Vare. 18 Mr. Roberts, you have four minutes 19 remaining. 20 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS 21 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 22 MR. ROBERTS: Thank you. 23 If I could first address the reasons why 24 this Court should not decide the separate transaction 25 issue itself in this case.

1 First of all, it's not the question 2 presented here which is limited to the meaning of the 3 statutory term "proceeds." Respondents didn't present 4 any alternative question in their briefs in opposition. 5 And, in fact, they don't present an alternative question 6 presented even in their briefs on the merits. They're 7 just using the concern about merger as a reason to 8 decide that proceeds means profit. 9 The separate transaction issue was decided 10 against Respondents adversely on direct appeal in the 11 Febus case, as my brother on the other side 12 acknowledged. And those kinds of issues that are 13 decided adversely on direct appeal shouldn't be 14 relitigated. 15 The issue wasn't raised in the separate 16 transaction issue, it wasn't raised in the Section 2255 17 issues, and wasn't addressed by the courts below in 18 these collateral proceedings. 19 At most, we say it should be left open for 20 another case that presents -- that presents the issue. 21 Beyond that, if this Court thought that something should 22 be left open for the court below to address, the court 23 below could address a range of possible ways to deal 24 with ensuring a separation, for example, Justice 25 Stevens's suggestion that an illegal gambling business

1 under the statute itself entails the payment of winners 2 and the payment of employees, although we don't think 3 that it does. 4 But a profits definition is not the way to 5 address concerns about overlap for the underlying 6 offense, because it makes no sense in the broader 7 context of the statute. 8 It would create significant uncertainty 9 about the scope of the statute because of the absence of 10 accounting rules. It would make proof very difficult as 11 a general matter because of the absence of those rules 12 and because criminals often don't keep accounting 13 records. It would exclude numerous concealment 14 transactions that Congress had no reason not to cover, 15 and it would cripple the government's ability to 16 prosecute professional money launderers, which are 17 really a significant part of the problem that Congress 18 was addressing. 19 If the Court has no further questions, we 20 would ask that the judgments of the court of appeals be 21 reversed. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 23 The case is submitted. 24 (Whereupon at 12:00 noon, the case in the 25 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
