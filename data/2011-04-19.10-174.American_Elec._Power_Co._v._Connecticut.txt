1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:13 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 today in Case 10-174, American Electric Power Company v. 5 Connecticut, et al. 6 Mr. Keisler. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. KEISLER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 10 please the Court: 11 This is a case in which the courts are being 12 asked to perform a legislative and regulatory function 13 in a matter in which the necessary balancing of 14 contending policy interests is among the most complex, 15 multifaceted, and consequential of any policy issue now 16 before the country. 17 The States ask that the courts assess 18 liability and design a new common law remedy for 19 contributing to climate change, and to do so by applying 20 a general standard of reasonableness to determine for 21 each defendant, in this case and in future cases, what, 22 if any, its share of global reductions in greenhouse gas 23 emissions ought to be. That would require the courts 24 not to interpret and enforce the policy choices placed 25 into law by the other branches, but to make those policy

1 choices themselves. And all of our arguments here - 2 that plaintiffs lack standing, that the Federal common 3 law shouldn't be expanded to include this new cause of 4 action, and that the case presents nonjusticiable 5 political questions -- while all of them represent 6 distinct points, All of them flow from the same basic 7 separation of powers principles that establish, we 8 believe, that the case ought to be dismissed. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that's - 10 MR. KEISLER: Now, all of these issues - 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's exactly one 12 thing that's concerned me. They do all flow from the 13 same basic argument, and I'm concerned why you think we 14 should focus on prudential standing, basically, which 15 cuts off our jurisdiction at our own whim, as opposed to 16 dealing with this on the merits. 17 MR. KEISLER: Well - 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In either case, your 19 argument is that this is too generalized for the Court 20 to -- to address. 21 MR. KEISLER: Mr. Chief Justice, our 22 principal argument has not been prudential standing. 23 The government has focused on the prudential standing 24 argument. We join that and we'd be happy to see the 25 case resolved on that basis, but our principal argument

1 on standing has been Article III standing. And we 2 actually believe that the Court could resolve this case 3 and address the issues in any order, with one possible 4 exception, which is that we do read the Court's decision 5 in Steel Co. as holding that the Court has to address 6 Article III standing before reaching the question 7 whether there's a valid cause of action. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Keisler, what -- what 9 good does it do you to have this Court say that there is 10 no Article III standing? The suit will just be brought 11 in State court - 12 MR. KEISLER: Well - 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- under State common 14 law and -- and the States' rules of standing are not 15 ours. 16 MR. KEISLER: Well, many States, Your Honor, 17 have similar doctrines of standing, similar doctrines of 18 political questions. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: They only need one. 20 MR. KEISLER: Well, in any event, Your 21 Honor, we believe we would have a very strong motion to 22 dismiss in State court on a variety of grounds, 23 including - 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: We're not sure about that, 25 are we? So we -- we -- we -- may be just spinning our

1 wheels here. 2 MR. KEISLER: Well, I don't - 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, you know, tapping 4 the case to State judges instead of Federal judges, I 5 would frankly rather have Federal judges do it, 6 probably. 7 MR. KEISLER: Well, as I said, Your Honor, I 8 think we would be able to defeat a State common law 9 claim on grounds of State law, for lack of proximate 10 cause, on standing and political question grounds that 11 many States have that parallel these; but in any case, 12 whichever ground the Court resolves this case on, we 13 think it's clear that the cause of action can proceed. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if -- if you had a 15 State court suit with a State plaintiff, wouldn't the 16 State be able to adduce Federal common law as a ground 17 for recovery? And then we would get to the merits and 18 see if there is a Federal common law cause of action. 19 MR. KEISLER: It's -- it's possible, Your 20 Honor, although we think they would be more likely to 21 proceed under State common law. But either way, we 22 don't think the elements of a State or Federal common 23 law cause of action under nuisance could be met here, 24 and we're very confident we could defeat that claim in 25 State court as well.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we all -- we all 2 know that you sometimes have to peek at the merits to 3 see if there's standing. There's a little cheating that 4 goes on. But -- but in this case it does seem to me 5 that you're lacking any clear precedent. When I think 6 of standing, I think of Frothingham v. Mellon. That 7 isn't this case. 8 MR. KEISLER: But the Court has said in 9 Warth v. Seldin that the plaintiff has to demonstrate 10 that it will benefit in some tangible way from the 11 Court's intervention. And that's - 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you have -- if you 13 have the precedent of Massachusetts v. EPA and if any 14 one plaintiff has standing, I guess that's enough. So 15 if you look at standing alone, it seems to me the States 16 would have standing on the same basis that Massachusetts 17 had standing. 18 MR. KEISLER: Justice Ginsburg, we believe 19 that Massachusetts was very carefully qualified to focus 20 on the particular regulatory context of that opinion. 21 The Court said that it was addressing standing to 22 challenge the denial of a petition for rulemaking, when 23 the agency would be proceeding incrementally to address 24 a broader problem, and a statute specifically gave the 25 petitioners the right to seek that kind of incremental

1 protection. The Court was very specific about that. 2 The statutory right was of critical importance, it said, 3 to the standing inquiry. 4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Keisler, the Court did 5 say that, but it's cut off from the Court's actual 6 analysis in the case. When the Court goes through 7 injury and causation and redressability, the Court never 8 refers to the statutory cause of action. 9 MR. KEISLER: But it does, Justice Kagan, 10 specifically refer to the regulatory context in which 11 the case is taking place. The Court said that if the 12 EPA's arguments there about traceability and 13 redressability were adopted, it would doom most 14 challenges to agency action because agencies proceed 15 incrementally. 16 Here we have no statute, we have no agency 17 proceeding incrementally, and we believe there is no 18 basis for the plaintiffs to seek that kind of 19 incremental relief when they've acknowledged that will 20 have no material effect on their injury; and they 21 acknowledged that in the State's complaint when they 22 specifically said that the relief they seek here would 23 only constitute these defendants' share of the larger 24 overall emissions reductions that would be necessary in 25 order to have any material effect on climate change or

1 the injuries that they assert. That is an 2 acknowledgment that the relief they seek here would not 3 provide them any redress except in connection with other 4 reductions that would be obtained elsewhere, and that we 5 think means that this is a classic case in which the 6 injuries are not the product of the defendants' conduct 7 but of the collective independent actions of numerous 8 third parties not before the Court. 9 JUSTICE KAGAN: But the Court clearly 10 understood that in Massachusetts v. EPA and said that it 11 was enough, and I would think under traditional standing 12 principles the standing there was actually harder to 13 find because one had to go through the EPA first. One 14 had to say the EPA should regulate, and then the EPA 15 would regulate, and then the question was would that 16 reduce emissions levels? Here the EPA is out of the 17 picture. The action is much more direct. 18 MR. KEISLER: But there, Your Honor, they 19 were suing a defendant, the EPA, that had regulatory 20 authority over the entire country. Here they're suing 21 five separate defendants, each of whom has to be 22 evaluated individually, and there is not a single one of 23 them against whom the relief sought would have any 24 tangible effect on the injuries that the plaintiffs 25 claim here. But we also think that Massachusetts is
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 relevant in a completely different respect, which is the 2 Court was very specific in Massachusetts about what its 3 role was and what it wasn't. The Court said: We lack 4 the expertise or the authority to second-guess the 5 policy choices of the EPA, but its role there was to 6 compel the agency to adhere to the statute as the Court 7 interpreted it. 8 In this case, the States are asking the 9 courts to play exactly the role that this Court 10 disclaimed in Massachusetts v. EPA, which is to make 11 those policy choices in the first instance, and they say 12 that the courts can do this because the courts have done 13 this in prior nuisance cases, but this case is nothing 14 like any of the prior nuisance cases this Court has 15 held. It's nothing like an instance in which one State 16 is complaining that another State has dumped sewage into 17 a body of water that's crossed the border. The case - 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how many States 19 does it take? I think, you know, if it's three States 20 who have made that allegation, I don't know exactly how 21 you draw the line between a case like Tennessee Copper 22 and this case. 23 MR. KEISLER: It's not a question of the 24 quantity of plaintiffs, Mr. Chief Justice, it's the 25 nature of the task that the Court would have to perform,
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and this task is different because of the global nature 2 of the phenomenon. 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm more receptive to this 4 kind of argument if I know we're going to the merits as 5 opposed to standing - 6 MR. KEISLER: It -- it - 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and I recognize that we 8 slip in and out of the two categories, and don't want to 9 make it difficult on you. But I take it that these 10 arguments also go to whether there's a cause of action 11 on the merits. 12 MR. KEISLER: Exactly, Your Honor, and 13 whether the Court should expand the Federal common law 14 to recognize this. The global nature of this phenomenon 15 makes it different because every sector of the economy 16 worldwide produces greenhouse gases, and there is no 17 geographic nexus, as there was in Tennessee Copper and 18 every one of the other nuisance cases, between the 19 source of the emission and the victim that claims the 20 harm. And that changes what the Court has to do. It 21 means that any court or policymaker thinking about how 22 to alleviate the kinds of injuries that are pled here 23 has to first think what is the appropriate overall level 24 of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere and then 25 make a comparative judgment about how the reductions
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that would be necessary to achieve that level should be 2 allocated among all the different sectors based on the 3 social good that that sector produces and what 4 reductions would mean to that social good. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your -- your 6 first argument when you addressed this issue was there 7 is a decisionmaker and that decisionmaker is EPA. So 8 you wouldn't get to even how arduous a task this would 9 be if it was within the court's bailiwick. I thought 10 your position was that the function, this regulatory 11 function, has been assigned to the EPA and not to the 12 courts. 13 MR. KEISLER: We are making both arguments, 14 Justice Ginsburg. We don't think there would be an 15 appropriate Federal common law cause of action even if 16 the Clean Air Act hadn't been enacted. But certainly 17 the argument is even stronger and easier because of the 18 existence of the Clean Air Act and in particular because 19 this Court in Massachusetts v. EPA interpreted the Clean 20 Air Act so that the term "pollutant" specifically 21 includes greenhouse gases, and that means that Congress 22 has assigned to EPA the task of making precisely the 23 determinations that plaintiffs ask the courts to make 24 here: Do greenhouse gases endanger the public, and if 25 so, what regulatory consequence -

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the EPA is given 2 authority to regulate other pollutants, including those 3 that do not go up into the atmosphere, but that does not 4 prevent California, for example, from enacting stricter 5 standards for its -- for automobiles in its State. 6 MR. KEISLER: Oh, and - 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: So why should we say the 8 EPA preempts the Federal common law? 9 MR. KEISLER: Because this issue, and I 10 would prefer to refer to it as displacement rather than 11 preemption, is very different from the question of 12 preemption of State law. The Clean Air Act has a 13 savings clause that preserves State authority across a 14 variety of areas, but the Court in second Milwaukee v. 15 Illinois cases specifically distinguished between 16 displacement of State law and displacement of Federal 17 common law. It said the -- the presumption is against 18 preemption of State law because of various concepts of 19 State sovereignty, but because of Federal concepts of 20 separation of powers, the presumption is in favor of 21 lawmaking by Congress and not lawmaking by courts, and 22 that means that the standard is very different. It 23 means that if Congress has addressed the problem, then 24 Federal common law is displaced. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's your best case?
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. KEISLER: Milwaukee v Illinois II. That 2 was the case in which the Court held that the Clean 3 Water Act displaced a Federal common law nuisance claim 4 by Illinois against Milwaukee and specifically said 5 because Congress had addressed the problem, Federal 6 common law had no role to play. Here Congress has 7 established a process and it's a process in which the 8 States and the private parties here can participate. 9 They can file petitions for rulemaking, they can appeal 10 EPA decisions that they oppose, and it would be 11 completely inconsistent with that process if they could 12 also take a complete end run around it and go to court 13 and ask courts to make the decisions that Congress has 14 assigned to EPA. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is a merits argument, 16 right? 17 MR. KEISLER: Yes, it is a merits argument, 18 because it says that any Federal common law action would 19 be displaced by the Clean Air Act. 20 Now, the - 21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Is the consequence of that 22 argument, Mr. Keisler, that there in fact is no Federal 23 common law of interstate pollution claims? 24 MR. KEISLER: I don't think there is very 25 much left of any Federal common law of interstate
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 pollution claims, just because the field has been so 2 heavily occupied by statutes. You know, all the 3 nuisance cases that the court of appeals relied on, Your 4 Honor, they were in a completely different time. They 5 were at a time when the Court's view of its common law 6 authority was extremely broad and its view of Congress's 7 constitutional power under the Commerce Clause was very 8 narrow. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you're going to 10 have to struggle with the preemption question sooner or 11 later. You're confident you can establish not only 12 displacement of Federal common law, but also preemption 13 of State common law, right? 14 MR. KEISLER: It will ultimately depend on 15 the state of the law at the time that such a 16 hypothetical case is filed, but we would welcome the 17 opportunity, Your Honor. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is part of the inquiry, 19 part of the dynamic, how imminent the Federal regulation 20 is? 21 MR. KEISLER: I don't think so, Justice 22 Kennedy. I think the question is always what Congress 23 has done, not what the stage of the EPA rulemaking 24 process is. Congress, not EPA, can create or modify or 25 destroy causes of action, and that's why the Court said
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 in that Milwaukee 2 case that when Congress has 2 addressed the problem that's the end of the inquiry. 3 And there is no question that Congress has addressed not 4 just the general problem, but the specific problem here. 5 It has the statute which assigns EPA the authority to 6 regulate pollutants in certain ways and pollutants have 7 been defined under Massachusetts v. EPA to include the 8 precise greenhouse gasses that are at issue here. 9 There couldn't be a more specific example of 10 Congress having addressed the problem and assigned a 11 different approach to dealing with it than letting the 12 courts work it out under Federal common law. 13 The States' and the private plaintiffs' 14 argument is that the Federal common law will only be 15 displaced when EPA adopts the precise regulation that 16 provides the precise form of relief that they're asking 17 for. There's no case that says that and that's not the 18 law. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: EPA couldn't give - 20 could EPA give that relief? We're dealing with existing 21 stationary sources. We're not dealing with new or 22 modified sources. 23 MR. KEISLER: We believe that the EPA can 24 consider, as it's undertaking to do, regulating existing 25 nonmodified sources under section 111 of the Clean Air
16

Alderson Reporting Company

1 Act, and that's the process that's engaged in now. It's 2 announced that it will propose standards in the summer 3 and complete a rulemaking by May. Obviously, at the 4 close of that process there could be APA challenges on a 5 variety of grounds, but we do believe that they have the 6 authority to consider standards under section 111. 7 And if the Court has no questions, with the 8 Court's permission I would like to reserve the balance 9 of my time. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 11 Keisler. 12 General Katyal. 13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL, 14 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT TENNESSEE VALLEY 15 AUTHORITY, IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS 16 GENERAL KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief 17 Justice, and may it please the Court: 18 In the 222 years that this Court has been 19 sitting, it has never heard a case with so many 20 potential perpetrators and so many potential victims, 21 and that quantitative difference with the past is 22 eclipsed only by the qualitative differences presented 23 today. Accordingly, the Court should apply the 24 prudential standing doctrine and hold these lawsuits not 25 fit for judicial resolution. The very name of the
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 alleged nuisance, "global warming," itself tells you 2 much of what you need to know. There are billions of 3 emitters of greenhouse gasses on the planet and billions 4 of potential victims as well. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, again, that just 6 goes to the merits. You make that argument to the 7 district court that your injunction is meaningless, 8 equity does not require an idle act. End of case. 9 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, Justice Kennedy, I 10 think it goes to both. That is, this Court in outlining 11 what the prudential standing doctrine is all about in, 12 for example, Newdow has said the following at page 11: 13 "Without prudential standing limitations, the Court 14 would be called upon to decide abstract questions of why 15 public significance, even though other governmental 16 institutions may be more competent to address the 17 questions and even though judicial intervention may be 18 unnecessary to protect individual rights. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'll add a third thing that 20 it goes to and that's Article III standing. It's clear 21 in our cases, if as you say the relief requested here 22 will not remedy the complaint of these people, you don't 23 have to go to prudential standing. That it seems to me 24 would deny Article III standing. 25 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, Justice Scalia, I
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 think that this case is best like Newdow, in which the 2 Court went to prudential standing first before Article 3 III. And the reason for that is because this court in 4 Massachusetts v. EPA, in analyzing the redressability 5 prong of what you're asking said that the reductions 6 that were sought there, if granted, would, quote, "slow 7 or reduce the problem." 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'll think about it, 9 but Newdow was a case where we thought that this 10 particular litigant was not directly injured. Here the 11 State said it's directly injured. That's the 12 distinction. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: More than that, Newdow 14 was a case of a father trying to assert a right on 15 behalf of a child, and the child herself did not want 16 that right nor did her mother. So it seems to me it's 17 worlds apart, and when you describe prudential standing 18 as involving generalized grievance, I thought that the 19 generalized grievance was Article III. I thought that's 20 what Mrs. Frothingham's case was about; it was a 21 grievance that she shared with everybody in the 22 populations, so she didn't have standing. 23 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, we're not 24 here saying that this case follows inexorably, 25 inexorably from the facts of Newdow or, frankly, from
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 any case that this Court has decided. There is no case 2 in the 222 years that announces the precise rule we're 3 seeking here, and the reason is because you have never 4 heard a case like this before involving the quantity and 5 quality of the claims sought here, the - 6 JUSTICE KAGAN: But it seems, General 7 Katyal, that there also is no case where we've ever used 8 this language of generalized grievance as a prudential 9 matter rather than as an Article III matter. So am I 10 wrong about that? 11 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think that this 12 Court has in Newdow and in Warth v. Seldin used the 13 language of generalized grievances to reflect prudential 14 considerations. 15 JUSTICE KAGAN: But Newdow -- Newdow quoted 16 the language of generalized grievance that came from 17 Warth, but it didn't specifically pin anything on that 18 language. 19 GENERAL KATYAL: I quite agree with you, 20 Justice Kagan. This is not like a case in which the 21 government is announcing some rule of standing that 22 requires the Court to, for example, call into question 23 previous precedents of this Court that reached the 24 merits or something like that. It's that this Court has 25 never had a case involving this scale and scope, and we
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 think that the prudential standing doctrine, at least in 2 a circumstance like this, which is a Federal common law 3 cause of action in which the Court is already being 4 asked to fashion the rules and, as Justice Scalia says, 5 an equitable action in which the Court has I think 6 special abilities to fashion relief if appropriate and 7 not -- I think prudential standing reflects best the 8 kind of tapestry of different factors. 9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, General Katyal, how 10 about the Aiken case, because in the Aiken case I think 11 the government came in and made the same argument, that 12 even though the injury was concrete, it was too 13 generalized and therefore there should be no standing, 14 the Court specifically rejected that argument both as to 15 Article III and as to prudential standing. 16 GENERAL KATYAL: Right, and I think Aiken 17 says that the prudential standing cases thus far have 18 been about has concrete injury been shown to a 19 particular person. And we're not disputing that for 20 purposes of Article III concrete injury has been shown 21 to at least one plaintiff, but we think that - 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: To that extent you 23 disagree with Mr. Keisler because he says there is no 24 Article III? 25 GENERAL KATYAL: That is absolutely correct,
21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 we do disagree to that extent. We think that prudential 2 standing best reflects the Court's general intuition in 3 this area that when a problem is of this magnitude and 4 literally involving the world, where everyone is a 5 potential perpetrator, everyone is a potential victim, 6 and where their own theory at page 15 of their brief and 7 32 and 40 states: "If someone contributes one drop to 8 the nuisance, they can be sued. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you don't 10 usually -- your phrase is exactly what bothers me. We 11 don't usually base a decision on our general intuition, 12 and the idea of prudential standing that we have 13 jurisdiction of the case but we're not going to decide 14 it is contrary to Chief Justice Marshall's famous line 15 that if we don't have jurisdiction, we can't decide it, 16 but if we do, we have to decide it. 17 GENERAL KATYAL: But I think that the 18 prudential standing doctrine generally and the zone of 19 interest test in particular really do focus on this 20 question, Mr. Chief Justice, about whether or not a case 21 can be cut down to judicially manageable standards. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'll give that you 23 on the zone of interests, but there you're dealing with 24 administrative law and a very narrow proposition. I 25 think it's Justice Kennedy's point, or at least the
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 point of his questions, that these issues meld into the 2 merits and, at least for anyone who is troubled by the 3 idea that we are not going to decide a case even though 4 we have jurisdiction to decide it, maybe that's the 5 better place to address it. 6 GENERAL KATYAL: I'll move to that and take 7 your invitation, Mr. Chief Justice. But before doing 8 so, I would say that if you're going to give me 9 administrative law and zone of interest I think you 10 should then give me Federal common law, which this Court 11 is at its height in terms of fashioning who can come 12 into court and what those rules may be. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand why you 14 assert that the remedy here will not provide the 15 relief -- you acknowledge that, don't you, that the 16 remedy here cannot possibly stop global warming, right? 17 GENERAL KATYAL: We acknowledge that the 18 relief that they are seeking looks like the relief in 19 Massachusetts v. EPA, which is that it would, if the 20 Court - 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: It does? It does? In 22 Massachusetts v. EPA the relief was allowing a Federal 23 agency to regulate the entire society's carbon 24 emissions. 25 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, that isn't

1 what the Court said. What the Court said is that it 2 would allow regulation in the transportation sector, 3 which would be approximately 1.7 billion tons, and here 4 they are saying 650 million tons. And so, I agree it's 5 less, but I think that the -- and one can criticize the 6 reasoning in the majority, but if that -- that is the 7 rule of this Court, and I think that as long as a 8 slowing or reduction - 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think -- do you 10 think that was the holding of Massachusetts v. EPA, that 11 EPA can only regulate the transportation section? 12 GENERAL KATYAL: That is what the Court 13 based its redressability analysis on. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the holding of the 15 case and -- and do you think the -- the -- the 16 forthcoming EPA rules can only govern transportation? 17 GENERAL KATYAL: Of course not. I'm just 18 saying that the - 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course not. Of course 20 the case covers - 21 GENERAL KATYAL: But I am talking - 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- what the EPA could do. 23 GENERAL KATYAL: Right. And I'm just 24 talking about the redressability part of the analysis, 25 Justice Scalia. For that the Court said that this

1 reduction in the transportation sector was sufficient. 2 If I could take the Mr. -- the Chief 3 Justice's invitation to address displacement at this 4 time. We believe that we meet the State's own test for 5 displacement, which is found at page 46 of their brief, 6 which is: "A Federal common law nuisance claim is 7 displaced when a Federal statute or regulatory action 8 addresses the nuisance." And here you have not just the 9 Clean Air Act, you have the Clean Air Act plus, a 10 cascade of a number of different actions taken after, 11 Justice Scalia, the opinion in Massachusetts v. EPA. 12 JUSTICE ALITO: At what point in this -- in 13 what point in this cascade did the displacement occur? 14 GENERAL KATYAL: We think that the Court 15 doesn't really need to get into it. And for the -- the 16 reason is this: Displacement actions are extremely 17 rare, Federal common law actions are rare, so we don't 18 think you should announce some sort of general standard 19 for when displacement occurs. It's a more case-by-case 20 situation. 21 Here you have undoubted evidence that it 22 occurred -- that it has occurred because of a number of 23 different things. 24 JUSTICE ALITO: We don't know what EPA may 25 do down the road, we don't know what Congress may do

1 down the road. So don't we have to have some idea about 2 when this takes place in order so that this precedent 3 may - 4 GENERAL KATYAL: Certainly - 5 JUSTICE ALITO: -- be applied to the future 6 course of conduct? 7 GENERAL KATYAL: Certainly, Justice Alito, I 8 think it's appropriate for the Court to look at what 9 has -- what is happening right now. And here's what's 10 happening. First, in December 2009 the EPA issued an 11 endangerment finding, finding these greenhouse gases 12 significant pollutants. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, General Katyal, suppose 14 that the EPA had decided not to issue the endangerment 15 finding. Would your argument still apply? 16 GENERAL KATYAL: I think that that would 17 present a difficult case, because it would be the one 18 like the Petitioners make, which is the Clean Air Act 19 alone. And I think that what the States themselves 20 acknowledge and what the language of Milwaukee II - 21 excuse me -- Milwaukee I says in it is that -- and this 22 is at page 107 of the opinion: "It may happen that new 23 Federal laws and new Federal regulations may in time 24 preempt the Federal common law of nuisance. We think 25 that both together presents the best and easiest case
26

1 for displacement," and you have that here. You have not 2 just the endangerment finding; you have the EPA 3 regulating all passenger cars, all light motor vehicles 4 right now. 5 JUSTICE KAGAN: But if I insisted you answer 6 the hypothetical I gave you, what would the answer be? 7 No endangerment finding. Is there displacement? 8 GENERAL KATYAL: I think that it's a -- it's 9 a difficult case to make for -- for displacement, but I 10 think it could be made, for the reasons Mr. Keisler 11 suggests. But I - 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is it -- I don't 13 want to make -- try to make a case for you, but why is 14 it that much more difficult? It's just -- I mean, it's 15 sort of like the negative commerce clause, right? The 16 fact that EPA has the authority to regulate in a 17 particular area means that the ball has passed from the 18 courts to the agency, to the executive branch, and 19 they've made an implicit decision not to regulate a 20 particular question. 21 GENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely. I think that 22 there's a good argument to be made. I imagine the 23 argument on the other side that you'll hear in a moment 24 is that the Clean Air Act doesn't look precisely like 25 the Clean Water Act in terms of forcing the agency to
27

1 decide various things. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess that would 3 be a preemption question rather than -- rather than a 4 displacement question. 5 GENERAL KATYAL: I think that very well may 6 be. And with respect to that, Mr. Chief Justice, you 7 had asked before about State common law causes of action 8 and whether they would be -- they would kind -- the 9 existence of those would somehow mean that the Court 10 should either find jurisdiction or reach the merits in a 11 way. And we think that the same arguments that prohibit 12 the Court from -- from -- from recognizing a Federal 13 common law cause of action for displacement very well 14 may be preemption questions as well that could be 15 addressed down the road with respect to State common law 16 actions. 17 And we don't think the Court should be 18 troubled by the existence of a potential State common 19 law cause of action. It's just like Milwaukee II, in 20 which the dissenters made precisely this argument. They 21 said: If you don't recognize it, then the States will 22 regulate it and it will balkanize and the like. And 23 what the majority said is: That's a question for down 24 the road; the question for now is has displacement 25 occurred?

1 JUSTICE ALITO: I understand that that's not 2 the issue here, but does the government have a position 3 on that if -- if New York law provides exactly the same 4 public nuisance claim that is now asserted under Federal 5 common law, would that be consistent? 6 GENERAL KATYAL: I -- I don't think we have 7 a position at this time on that. That's I think an 8 enormously complicated question we can get to at an 9 appropriate time. Our central -- our central submission 10 to you on displacement is this: That there is literally 11 no precedent for the argument that they are making here, 12 which is that the Federal Government has to regulate the 13 precise jot and tittle, the specific relief that they 14 are seeking before displacement occurs. 15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you have a position on 16 whether there's anything to be displaced here? Do you 17 have a position on whether there is, in fact, a Federal 18 cause of action? 19 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, we think, again, the 20 Court doesn't need to get into that question because 21 it -- you know, the -- there are few Federal common law 22 causes of action in the area of nuisance -- I mean, and 23 there have been two that the Federal Government has 24 filed since 1970 and three that we can find all together 25 in the Federal courts of appeals, all of which have
29

1 failed for various displacement reasons, and the others. 2 We think none of those look anything like 3 the -- the common law cause of action here. And, so, it 4 would at least require this Court to extend quite 5 dramatically Federal common law to cover this type of 6 situation in which everyone is a potential perpetrator 7 and everyone is a potential victim. And it would 8 require the Court, in fashioning relief, to think 9 through a number of things that the Federal courts 10 haven't ever had to grapple with from the nature - 11 JUSTICE ALITO: So, if there were -- if 12 there were no Clean Air Act, you would still say that 13 this suit, a suit like this, would -- would fail 14 prudential standing, but you don't have a position as to 15 whether there would be a claim under Federal common law? 16 GENERAL KATYAL: That is correct. We think 17 it would still fail prudential standing because of the 18 quantity and quality of the nature of the problem here, 19 and the multitude of different policy judgments that 20 would be required -- that this Court would be required 21 to undertake to adjudicate a Federal common law cause of 22 action in the absence of a statute. 23 JUSTICE KAGAN: But I'm sorry, General, 24 because I was understanding your answer differently, and 25 maybe I misheard you, as saying that if there were no
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 legislation here, you doubted that there was a Federal 2 law cause of action. Is that correct? 3 GENERAL KATYAL: I doubted that there was 4 prudential standing. 5 JUSTICE KAGAN: No, but as to whether the 6 cause of action exists under Federal common law in a 7 case like this, where you said it was so different from 8 the other Federal common law cases that the Court has 9 seen. 10 GENERAL KATYAL: I -- I -- I think I put it 11 as we doubt it. I mean, I think that it would require a 12 dramatic extension, Justice Kagan, of a case like 13 Tennessee Copper and the other cases that this Court has 14 heard, which are essentially: A pollutes a river or 15 something and hurts B. A here is the world and B is the 16 world, and that is such a difference in scale and scope 17 to pose enormously difficult questions as to whether 18 this Court should recognize such a cause of action. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Same -- same hypothetical, 20 assume no Federal statute, and -- and assume no Federal 21 common law. What about State law? Does State common 22 law become displaced because it's a matter of Federal 23 concern? We don't -- we don't -- we don't usually have 24 preemption of Federal common law. 25 GENERAL KATYAL: Well -- well, there may be
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 arguments, Justice Kennedy -- I'm not sure if the 2 premise of your question has a Clean Air Act in 3 existence or not. There may be some sort of arguments 4 about displacement or preemption under the Clean Air 5 Act - 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The hypothetical is that 7 the Federal law -- Federal statutory law doesn't apply. 8 GENERAL KATYAL: Then I think that again for 9 purposes of State common law, I think this Court would 10 approach that question the same way it did in Milwaukee 11 II, which is to say that's a really separate 12 policy-based question that the Court doesn't use to 13 answer the questions about whether a cause of action 14 should be recognized or whether displacement has 15 occurred. But I would point out that the States that 16 have sued generally have doctrines like prudential 17 standing, doctrines like political question, that may 18 very well bar the reaching of these claims in State 19 courts as well. 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It would be very odd to 21 say that there's no Federal common law, but also that 22 there's no -- no displacement of State law. That - 23 that seems to me odd. 24 GENERAL KATYAL: That's precisely the 25 situation that -- that this Court was grappling with in
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Milwaukee II, and it said that - 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we get to -- to the 3 situation that now exists? They are seeking standards 4 for existing sources. I asked Mr. Keisler, and do you 5 agree with him, this is not a -- this is not a new 6 source or a modified source; we're talking about 7 existing sources. Does EPA, could EPA, regulate and set 8 standards for existing sources? 9 GENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely, Justice 10 Ginsburg. Let me say three things about that. First 11 is, EPA is currently regulating existing sources. To 12 the extent that a power plant is modified in any way to 13 increase carbon dioxide above a certain amount -- and 14 this is one of the so-called tailoring rules -- then 15 those power plants right now are subject to regulation. 16 Indeed, one has already had to get a permit. These 17 regulations just went into effect in January 2011 for 18 existing power plants that seek to modify. 19 Second, there is a settlement agreement in 20 place that commits EPA by May of 2012 to deciding how 21 and whether to regulate existing power sources, the 22 existing stationary sources. 23 And third, and I think most fundamentally, 24 there is no precedent, Justice Ginsburg, that says that 25 the government must regulate the specific industry, the
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 specific thing that the plaintiff isolates, in order for 2 displacement to occur. Rather, Sea Clammers and 3 Milwaukee II I think make explicit that that's the wrong 4 question. And so long as the nuisance is being 5 addressed -- and here the nuisance is undoubtedly being 6 addressed with a panoply of different Federal actions in 7 the area of global warming, and an executive order that 8 says that fighting global warming is one of the 9 government's highest priorities -- and concrete steps 10 taken, such as the 500-page tailoring rule, the 11 400-page -- the -- the other hundreds of pages that EPA 12 has done with its experts to appropriately regulate 13 greenhouse gas emissions, as opposed to a Federal common 14 law court of action doing something which would frankly 15 put you all at sea in terms of the complexity, 16 economics, international nature of the problem. 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: General, could I take you 18 back on that last point to another threshold question, 19 which is the political question doctrine? Because a lot 20 of your arguments really sound like prongs two and three 21 from Baker v. Carr, but you say that we shouldn't go 22 there, that we should instead address this matter on 23 prudential standing grounds. But the political question 24 doctrine actually seems more natural, given the kinds of 25 arguments you're making. So why not?

1 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, Justice Kagan, I'm 2 not going to tarry too long on which different way we 3 should win this case. I think either is an appropriate 4 way. 5 (Laughter.) 6 GENERAL KATYAL: But I think that the 7 prudential standing doctrine is a bit narrower because 8 it -- it contemplates a variety of factors, including 9 the fact that this is a Federal common law cause of 10 action where the Court is fashioning relief in the first 11 place, as opposed to the political question doctrine 12 which looks -- looks more to the standardless nature of 13 the adjudication. 14 We agree that -- that the political question 15 doctrine is an appropriate way to dismiss of this case, 16 but we think that, like Newdow, like Kowalski, this 17 Court can handle this case on prudential standing first 18 and recognize that this is an unprecedented action 19 involving literally the world, and it is not suited for 20 judicial resolution, and that flows quite naturally from 21 the precepts of the prudential standing doctrine. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not an area where 23 the Court can't go. To take a political question we all 24 agree on, I think, the courts can't mess with the 25 impeachment of a president, just -- but here the Court
35

Alderson Reporting Company

1 does deal with the subject matter all the time. It 2 reviews decisions that the EPA has made. 3 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, we quite 4 agree, and that is why we say that if a statute were - 5 were announced to provide standards, that that would 6 provide a way around the political question problem that 7 exists in this case. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General. 9 General Underwood. 10 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD 11 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 12 MS. UNDERWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 13 it please the Court: 14 This case rests on the longstanding 15 fundamental authority of the States to protect their 16 land, their natural resources, and their citizens from 17 air pollution emitted in other States. It rests on 18 three propositions: One, the interests of the States 19 are harmed by global warming; two, these defendants, as 20 the five largest U.S. emitters of carbon dioxide, are 21 significant contributors to it; and, three, these 22 defendants could take reasonable, cost-effective 23 measures to reduce their emissions in a way that would 24 slow the effects of global warming. 25 We will have to prove these propositions,
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and after we do the district court will have to 2 determine whether it can frame an appropriate equitable 3 injunction. That's what discovery and trials are for. 4 But this Court should not close the courthouse door to 5 this case at the outset. The common law action for 6 public nuisance has been around for hundreds of years, 7 has been adapted by courts to cover new environmental 8 threats, and there's no reason why the courts can't do 9 the same thing here. 10 The defendants say there are too many 11 plaintiffs, too many potential defendants, and that 12 adjudication of this case will require courts to solve 13 the entire problem of global warming, but that is simply 14 not so. 15 On the plaintiffs' side, this is about the 16 States. We are alleging the kind of injury to States 17 that has been traditionally recognized by this Court; 18 their lands, their citizens, their businesses are being 19 injured by pollution emitted in other States. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Underwood, the - 21 the relief that you're seeking, asking a court to set 22 standards for emissions, sounds like the kind of thing 23 that EPA does. I mean, Congress set up the EPA to 24 promulgate standards for emissions, and now what -- the 25 relief you're seeking seems to me to set up a district
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 judge, who does not have the resources, the expertise, 2 as a kind of super EPA. 3 MS. UNDERWOOD: It's not as a super EPA. 4 It's something much smaller. It's a different question. 5 Interstate pollution disputes have historically been 6 entrusted to the courts, including the determination of 7 how much is unreasonable, which is - 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we just 9 concentrate on I think the relief you want, you say: 10 District court, if we pass everything else, you set 11 emissions standards, you put a cap immediately, you set 12 a cap, and then annually you require further reductions. 13 Well, that just sounds to me like what EPA does when it 14 sets emission standards. 15 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, it's also like what 16 the Court did in Tennessee Copper. That is to say, this 17 case doesn't ask the Court to decide how much, contrary 18 to what Petitioners suggest, to decide how much emission 19 reduction is required to solve the whole problem of 20 global warming and then allocate a portion to these 21 defendants. It asks the Court to do something simpler, 22 and that is to decide whether these defendants can take 23 reasonable cost-effective measures that would help to 24 slow the pace of global warming. So - 25 JUSTICE ALITO: How does a district judge
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 decide what is reasonable and cost-effective? There are 2 considerations -- this is not a situation in which the 3 emission of greenhouse gases can be totally prohibited. 4 MS. UNDERWOOD: Correct. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: There are other -- there are 6 countervailing interests. So how does the court -- how 7 can a district court balance those interests? 8 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I would say two things 9 about that. One, it was also true in Tennessee Copper 10 that it was not the case that the sulfur emissions could 11 be eliminated or that the plant was to be put out of 12 business. The Court in that case ordered a reduction of 13 sulfur, a quite specific reduction of sulfur emissions 14 in one season and more in another season. And how 15 does - 16 JUSTICE ALITO: But do you seriously argue 17 this isn't -- this isn't orders of magnitude more 18 complicated than that case? 19 MS. UNDERWOOD: It's somewhat more -- it's 20 larger. I don't know if it's more complicated. The way 21 a court would do that is presumably the way it did it in 22 Tennessee Copper. That is, there could be expert 23 testimony, there could also be evidence about whether - 24 what other emitters are doing, what they do that is 25 feasible and cost-effective to reduce their emissions.

1 In Tennessee Copper, one of the defendants settled, and 2 the other was subject to an order, and it would have 3 been available to the Court to look to what the settling 4 defendant did for some indication of what the 5 nonsettling defendant might well be ordered to do. So 6 there is evidence available from which a court could 7 conclude what is reasonable. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what is the 9 -- what factors go into the cost-benefit analysis that 10 would have to be undertaken to decide what level of 11 emissions are reasonable in light of the threat of 12 global -- global warming? 13 MS. UNDERWOOD: The available technology, 14 the cost of that technology - 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Obviously the 16 greatest benefit to reduce global warming would be, of 17 course, to shut down the power plants, right? 18 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, we haven't asked for 19 that and nobody suggests that that would be appropriate. 20 It's not, any more than it was in Tennessee Copper. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because -- right. 22 But I mean, across the economy, the whole problem of 23 dealing with global warming is that there are costs and 24 benefits on both sides, and you have to determine how 25 much you want to readjust the world economy to address
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 global warming, and I think that's a pretty big burden 2 to post -- to impose on a district court judge. 3 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, it's also a burden 4 that the plaintiffs would have to bear. That is to say, 5 we have alleged, and are entitled to try to prove -- and 6 we might fail; that would be for the district judge to 7 determine -- that "the defendants have available to them 8 practical, feasible" -- I'm reading from the 9 complaint -- "and economically viable options for 10 reducing carbon dioxide emissions without significantly 11 increasing the cost of electricity to their customers, 12 including changing fuels, improving efficiency, and 13 altering" - 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're dealing with 15 an electric grid that connects I don't know how vast an 16 area, but certainly a vast area here. And the fact that 17 they can reduce their emissions in a way that doesn't 18 affect their customers is based on the fact that other 19 power plants that are part of the grid will serve part 20 of those -- will serve the customers' needs to some 21 extent. 22 MS. UNDERWOOD: It may or may not be based 23 on this. These are facts that can be proven or not 24 proven at trial. 25 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, General, they're
41

Alderson Reporting Company

1 usually facts that are determined by an administrative 2 agency. I mean, even just reading that part of your 3 complaint, it sounds like the paradigmatic thing that 4 administrative agencies do rather than courts. 5 MS. UNDERWOOD: But if there were no agency 6 and if there were no Clean Air Act and somebody was 7 shooting poison into the air in a way that injured 8 people in another State, the States would have the - 9 JUSTICE KAGAN: But if there were no and if 10 there were no, we would be living in a different world. 11 There is an administrative agency and there is a Clean 12 Air Act. 13 MS. UNDERWOOD: But those -- those are 14 questions about what has been called the merits or 15 displacement. The question of Article III standing, the 16 question of justiciability, the question of political 17 question, those are the same questions whether there's 18 an agency or not. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We can concede that, but 20 we still have the displacement argument - 21 MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY -- in front of us, and I 23 thought that's what we were addressing. 24 MS. UNDERWOOD: We can talk about the 25 displacement argument. I just wanted to be sure that -
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 I understood the question of standards to be a question 2 addressed to the political question point. And even if 3 it might be desirable to have an agency set standards, 4 it is not something that is beyond the power of a court 5 to do. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Can the courts set a tax? 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The agency -- the agency 8 is engaged in that, in it right now, and that's another 9 facet of this case, the potential for conflict. The 10 EPA, after acting for a while, has now agreed that it 11 does have authority to classify this as a pollutant and 12 it has taken the first steps. 13 One argument that the EPA -- that the United 14 States is presenting is the way agencies go about this 15 is incrementally, so they're starting with motor 16 vehicles and then maybe they will go to new sources, and 17 then they'll get to maybe where you are. But you want 18 the Court to start with the existing sources, to set 19 limits that may be in conflict with what an existing 20 agency is doing. 21 Do we ignore the fact that the EPA is there 22 and that it is regulating in this area? 23 MS. UNDERWOOD: No, we do not ignore that. 24 This is a very peculiar moment in time for this case to 25 arrive in this Court, because what is offered as
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 displacing is something that is said to be imminent, not 2 something that actually exists, and something that is 3 imminent may never happen. It was, of course, for that 4 reason that I believe the United States suggested a GBR 5 and we suggested that the case be dismissed so that the 6 lower courts could deal with the unfolding events as 7 they occur. 8 But the case is here now, and there is no 9 Federal statute or regulation that currently regulates 10 the emission of greenhouse gases by existing unmodified 11 power plants, like the ones operated by the defendants. 12 And the Clean Air Act works very differently from the 13 Clean Water Act. It did not put in place a permit 14 system for all emissions when it was enacted in 1970. 15 Unlike the Clean Water Act 2 years later, which forbids 16 all discharges until they're authorized by permit, the 17 Clean Air Act doesn't regulate anything until the EPA 18 makes findings and imposes restrictions. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I suppose there 20 were reasons that Congress adopted that approach, and 21 your suit would override those determinations. 22 MS. UNDERWOOD: No, our suit is consistent 23 with those determinations. That is to say, the design 24 of the statute leaves preexisting law in place until EPA 25 steps in.

1 If the Clean Air Act were thought to 2 displace the common law before any regulation occurred, 3 that would mean the immediate effect of this 4 antipollution law in 1970 was to reduce pollution 5 control because - 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How much -- how much 7 regulation do you need before you would admit that there 8 is displacement? Is it -- is it a preemption analysis 9 that you're adopting or a displacement analysis? 10 MS. UNDERWOOD: It's a displacement 11 analysis. I believe it's a displacement analysis. 12 What -- what we start from is that the States have a 13 historic right to go to court under the Federal common 14 law and that to -- to -- to deal with the problem of 15 interstate pollution, and that that was a promise that 16 they obtained, the Federal remedy, in exchange for the 17 surrender of sovereignty in joining the Union. So there 18 has to be -- there's a strong Federal interest in there 19 being a Federal remedy. 20 Now, when the Clean Air Act was -- was 21 passed, without any regulations, if it displaced the 22 Federal common law, there would be no Federal law 23 applicable at all, because the Federal common law would 24 be displaced and there would be no Federal regulatory 25 law. The States would have recourse at that point to
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 State common law, as has been suggested. That would be 2 available still. 3 But this Court has said repeatedly, and it's 4 correct, that there is a strong Federal interest in 5 regulating this subject matter of interstate pollution 6 with Federal law. Federal common law is the default 7 position, and when some -- when -- when Congress and the 8 agency act to displace Federal law and put in place - 9 to displace Federal common law and put in place Federal 10 regulatory law, that's when the displacement occurs. So 11 when - 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is -- what is 13 your test for displacement? When do we tell whether 14 there's displacement or not? Has there been some 15 displacement in this case but just not total 16 displacement or - 17 MS. UNDERWOOD: There's been displacement as 18 to automobiles. The EPA made a considered judgment 19 about emissions of carbon dioxide with respect to light 20 motor vehicles. The EPA has made no judgment with 21 respect to stationary sources. 22 JUSTICE KAGAN: What if the EPA made a 23 judgment, but it just was not the judgment that you 24 liked? Suppose that the EPA said: We've looked at 25 stationary sources; we're not going to regulate. Would

UNDERWOOD: I think if it were a 3 judgment that the amount of carbon dioxide emission from 4 stationary sources that was currently happening was 5 the -- was the correct amount, that would displace. If 6 the - 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That sounds like - 8 that sounds like preemption to me and not displacement, 9 or at least preemption with another label. 10 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, of course, there are 11 some similarities between the two. In each case we're 12 talking about whether Federal -- whether one law 13 substitutes for another, whether one law ousts another. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe you can 15 tell me in what -- to what extent displacement is 16 different from preemption. Tell me in this area you're 17 going to have displacement but not preemption. Or I 18 guess it's the other way around, in which there's going 19 to be preemption but not -- well, what's the difference? 20 You said in response to Justice Kagan that 21 if they've made a considered decision that this is the 22 amount and no other amount higher or lower, then there 23 would be displacement. In what way is that different 24 from preemption? 25 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, the difference isn't
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 on that front. The difference is that with respect to 2 preemption Congress has to decide that it does -- that 3 it wishes to override State law expressly. Here what 4 we're talking about is simply whether Congress or the 5 agency has acted. It's a little different. They don't 6 have to have in mind Federal common law. They simply 7 have to act in a way that over -- that -- that 8 substitutes for Federal common law, because the promise 9 of the republic really for the States was that the 10 States would have a Federal law applicable to their 11 interstate pollution disputes, and until - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't think - 13 MS. UNDERWOOD: -- there's a new one, they 14 have the old one. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that they 16 have to have in mind State law for preemption, either. 17 If indeed the State law just positively conflicts with a 18 Federal statute, it doesn't matter whether Congress had 19 State law in mind, does it? I don't know - 20 MS. UNDERWOOD: No, but -- perhaps not. But 21 we -- we talk about, though, whether there was intent - 22 that -- that preemption is ultimately a matter of 23 congressional intent and whether Congress intended 24 and -- and preemption should not be lightly inferred. 25 It's probably the case that preemption should be harder

1 to find in a close case. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you haven't told us 3 how. It -- it -- it's certainly not harder to find 4 because for preemption you require congressional intent, 5 whereas here -- whereas for displacement you don't. 6 That's not the -- that's not the difference. What - 7 what is the difference? 8 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I think in this 9 context they probably work pretty similarly. I would 10 just say that in each case the question is, what is 11 the -- what does the new law do with respect to the law 12 that it is said to replace? And - 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you're right 14 that under your theory they operate pretty similarly and 15 I thought the whole point of Milwaukee v. Illinois was 16 that they are two very distinct propositions. 17 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, they have different 18 reasons for existing, that's certainly what Milwaukee v. 19 Illinois said. That doesn't mean they have to in every 20 instance operate differently. The point of preemption 21 is about the Federal-State balance, and displacement is 22 simply -- is about separation of powers and the 23 interaction of various agencies within the Federal 24 Government. It shouldn't be surprising - 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your point is that EPA,
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 unless and until EPA gets to the point of setting 2 standards for existing sources, the court can be side by 3 side with the agency; we know that the agency is 4 beginning, it starts with light motor vehicles, and then 5 it's moving forward. But you say as long as the EPA 6 hasn't gotten to stationary sources, the court can be 7 conducting a similar function with -- one of many 8 differences is that if the EPA is setting the standards 9 they will set -- they will do it through notice and 10 comment, everybody will be able to put in a submission; 11 but the court substituting for the EPA, how does the 12 court replicate that notice and comment process? 13 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, you say the court 14 substituting for the EPA. It would be the EPA 15 substituting for the court. That is, the default, the 16 beginning position before there was legislation, before 17 there was an agency, was a common law remedy. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But now there is an 19 agency, and we know that it operates in a certain way, 20 through notice and comment rulemaking. 21 MS. UNDERWOOD: I - 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And here is the court and 23 how does it operate to get to those standards? 24 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, TVA suggests that 25 there's an inexorable march, that there's a regulatory
50

Alderson Reporting Company

1 program underway. But what they point to is an 2 agreement by EPA to begin considering whether to 3 regulate new and existing power plants. That can't be 4 enough. The Federal common law exists for the purpose 5 of giving States a remedy for interstate pollution, and 6 if it's displaced when -- when the EPA begins thinking 7 about it, then EPA could think about it for a long time. 8 They've said when they hope to complete this rulemaking, 9 but it is not uncommon for delays to -- to enter into 10 such processes, and it could be a long time before EPA 11 actually arrives at a judgment. A lot can happen to 12 delay or derail the fulfillment of a promise. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: General, do you think that 14 you have a Federal common law cause of action against 15 anybody in the world? Your briefs talk a lot about how 16 these are the five largest emissions producers, but I 17 saw nothing in your theory to limit it to those five. 18 Is there something that you think limits it to large 19 emissions producers rather than anybody in the world? 20 MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes. I think limitations, a 21 limitation to substantial sources -- and I'll talk in a 22 minute about what that might mean -- comes from the 23 Restatement definition, from garden variety State cases 24 about -- involving nuisance, and also perhaps from the 25 requirements of standing itself.

1 This case asks the Court to recognize that 2 the States can sue the largest emitters of carbon 3 dioxide. These defendants produce 650 million tons a 4 year or 10 percent of U.S. emissions, and individually 5 they produce amounts ranging from 1 to 3 and a half 6 percent of U.S. emissions. There is no other company 7 that comes close except perhaps for a handful of the 8 next largest power companies. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're -- you're lumping 10 them all together. Suppose you lump together all the 11 cows in the country. Would -- would that allow you to 12 sue all those farmers? I mean, don't you have to do it 13 defendant by defendant? 14 MS. UNDERWOOD: Courts sometimes - 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Cow by cow, or at least 16 farm by farm? 17 MS. UNDERWOOD: Courts sometimes aggregate 18 joint contributors to pollution, particularly where the 19 remedy that's sought is injunctive relief. If this were 20 a damage action there would be a different problem of 21 allocating to each individual defendant. But the relief 22 that's sought here is the same injunction. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you can lump everybody 24 together, so you can lump together all the people in the 25 United States -

For another thing, there's no way that 7 breathing - 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. All -- all 9 homes - 10 MS. UNDERWOOD: -- could be found 11 unreasonable. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- all homes that -- that 13 emit carbon dioxide in their -- in their heating 14 systems. 15 MS.

UNDERWOOD: No. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you say that, you know, 20 that equals 10 percent or whatever. Does that give you 21 a basis? 22 MS. UNDERWOOD: It is not necessary to 23 aggregate to have these five defendants stand apart from 24 everybody else. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then don't give us a

UNDERWOOD: 3 1/2 percent of U.S. 6 emissions. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why do you 8 stop at U.S. emissions? What percentage of worldwide 9 emissions, every one of which I assume harms your 10 clients, do these five power plants represent? 11 Infinitesimal, right? 12 MS. UNDERWOOD: Not infinitesimal, actually. 13 I believe that U.S. emissions are a quarter of world 14 emissions, so you would divide these numbers by four 15 approximately. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: From power plants or 17 total emissions? 18 MS. UNDERWOOD: Total emissions. And - 19 JUSTICE ALITO: And anybody who is a 20 substantial contributor could be sued? 21 MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes. And in terms of 22 determining what -- who is a substantial contributor, 23 there are -- because I do think that at some point a 24 company's emissions or a cow's would be too small to 25 give rise to a standing or -- to either standing or a

1 nuisance claim, and there are various ways to draw the 2 lines. It's a familiar task for common law courts to 3 decide how much is substantial, too. But for an 4 example, if the cut-off were producers of 100,000 tons 5 per year, as in the EPA tailoring rule for new sources, 6 just to take an example, then according to EPA's own 7 technical data there would be at most a few thousand 8 potential defendants. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree -10 General Katyal began his argument in fairly dramatic 11 fashion by saying we've never in 222 years had a case 12 where the relief, the damages and the relief sought, 13 were as broad as they are here. Do you have anything to 14 rebut his proposition? Any case where it has been as 15 broad as it is here? 16 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, of course it depends 17 on what you call broad. There are -- there are many 18 cases, small cases involving an attempt to limit 19 discharges by companies. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's your best - 21 what's your candidate to rebut his proposition? 22 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well - 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A broader case with 24 respect to the infliction of damage and the need for 25 relief.

1 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I guess what I would 2 say is that cases allowing suits against large 3 contributors, with or without others, and dismissing 4 against small and remote contributors, I give you three 5 State cases that are cited in our briefs: A California 6 case about a large mine that was sued for polluting a 7 river when lots of -- lots of others polluted it and 8 were not before the court. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, not as many as 10 contribute to global warming? 11 MS. UNDERWOOD: No, that's correct. But we 12 could talk about -- if we talk about large contributors 13 here, then we're not talking about so many contributors. 14 We could have it -- we could have it down to, to 15 thousands or hundreds or tens, depending on how we 16 defined large. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One aspect of the 18 litigation process as opposed to the agency process, the 19 agency makes its rule and that can be challenged in 20 court, but suppose your plaintiffs lost this case on 21 merits. I take it this is not a class action, there's 22 no certification of any class. Other plaintiffs before 23 another district court could launch a similar action 24 against these very same defendants, right? There would 25 be nothing to preclude that?

UNDERWOOD: There would be others who 6 have -- would have -- who would have the ability, other 7 States, I suppose. I mean, our claim here is that this 8 Federal common law nuisance is available first and 9 foremost for the States; and the question of whether the 10 land trusts or any other private parties could even 11 bring it is - 12 JUSTICE ALITO: Even if you won and the 13 district court imposed some sort of limit would be there 14 any other obstacle to other plaintiffs bringing suits 15 and another district court issuing a different standard? 16 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, the -- ultimately such 17 things would be resolved by appeal and by -- by the 18 circuit courts. I mean, there are conflicts in many 19 areas. That's true about every district court 20 litigation. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, it's not, 22 and it's not true of every litigation in this sense, 23 that everyone is harmed by global warming. So unless 24 you limit your suits to the States, which would -- I'm 25 not aware of a principled basis for doing that -- every
57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 individual can bring -- every individual in the world if 2 they can establish jurisdiction can bring one of these 3 cause of -- causes of action. 4 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, a principal basis to 5 limit -- the common -- the Federal common law of 6 nuisance, as I said, exists principally for the States, 7 for the reason it survived Erie was the Court spoke of 8 the strong Federal interest in providing the States with 9 a remedy for interstate pollution. So there is a 10 principle there. 11 And then beyond the States, plaintiffs would 12 have to, to bring a common law nuisance claim as well as 13 to have standing, would have to have a special injury of 14 some kind that would distinguish them from the 15 general -- from the general public. The Land Trusts 16 here argue that they, because they hold their lands in 17 trust for the public, they have special standing. 18 That's -- there's no need to reach that question. This 19 case could turn and should turn on the right of the 20 States to protect their people from -- and their -- and 21 their land from -- from interstate - 22 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, General, much of your 23 argument depends on this notion that this suit is really 24 like any other pollution suit, but all those other 25 pollution suits that you've been talking about are much
58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 more localized affairs. One factory emitting discharge 2 into one stream. They don't involve these kinds of 3 national/international policy issues of the kind that 4 this case does. I mean, there's a huge gap, a chasm 5 between the precedents you have and this case, isn't 6 there? 7 MS. UNDERWOOD: I don't know if I would call 8 it a chasm, but there's a large distance between them, 9 and -- but I would like to separate two things. The 10 international aspects of this are simply, I think, 11 beyond -- we're not suggesting that this -- this -- that 12 the Federal common law of nuisance entails relief 13 against international defendants. It does exist for 14 interstate -- for conflicts between the States 15 essentially. So I would like to put those aside. 16 And then, in terms of the magnitude, well, 17 there are many cases, not just one factory, the 18 Milwaukee v. Illinois itself involved not just the 19 Milwaukee sewage district that -- that was sued, but 20 there were many other contributors to pollution in that 21 lake. 22 JUSTICE ALITO: In setting these standards, 23 there would somebody difficult trade-offs, wouldn't 24 there? Could you just explain in concrete terms how a 25 district judge would deal with those? Let -- and just
59

Alderson Reporting Company

1 determining the facts is going to be hard enough, but 2 let's assume all the facts are proven, there's not a 3 dispute about the facts. So that if a certain reduction 4 in greenhouse gas emissions is ordered, that will have 5 this effect, it will increase the cost of electricity by 6 a certain amount, and that will produce certain effects. 7 It will result in the loss of a certain number of jobs, 8 it will mean that consumers will have less money to 9 spend on other -- other things. Some people will not be 10 able to have air conditioning in the summer. That will 11 have health effects. 12 How is the district judge -- what standard 13 does the district judge have to decide those? It's 14 just -- what is it, just what's reasonable? 15 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, reasonableness is the 16 beginning. I -- I've suggested already first that we've 17 alleged that this can be done without increasing the 18 cost to the consumers. That may seem -- that -- that is 19 a subject for proof. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Implausible -- implausible 21 is the word you're looking for. 22 (Laughter.) 23 MS. UNDERWOOD: Thank you, Justice Scalia. 24 But a very good place to look is what other 25 companies have been able to do or have done, including,
60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 as I suggested, in Tennessee Copper and perhaps in this 2 area as well, companies that settle this litigation or 3 companies that don't litigate but instead do adopt 4 measures that haven't been widely adopted. There - 5 there is a practice to examine in the world about what's 6 feasible and what's cost-effective, and that's not 7 different from - 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I suppose 9 cost-effective -- suppose your complaint is the same but 10 you alleged, what I get from reading these might be the 11 best way to deal with the problem. I would like the 12 court to impose a tax of $20 a ton on carbon, right? 13 And we bring all the polluters in, and the same injury 14 that you have, everything's the same, you have 14 15 experts who say this is how to get it done. It's 16 cost-effective, it will lead to substitution, it will 17 actually bring about a world without global warming, and 18 so let's do it. 19 Now, does the district judge, in your 20 opinion, have the power to enter that order? 21 MS. UNDERWOOD: I don't think so. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, now next 23 question is going to be, if he does not have the power 24 to enter that order, which could be proved to be 25 extremely effective, and least possible harm to the
61

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 consumer, why does he have the power to enter the order 2 you want? 3 MS. UNDERWOOD: Because the common law of 4 nuisance is addressed to direct the polluter to abate 5 the nuisance. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, this will. This is 7 addressed to that. It says abate the nuisance, here's 8 how you're going to do it. You're going to put a $20 a 9 tax ton on carbon, and lo and behold, you will discover 10 that nuisance will be abated. And we bring in 15 11 economists. 12 MS. UNDERWOOD: Actually, the order we're 13 asking for is less intrusive than that. We ask the 14 defendants to abate the nuisance, we ask the court to 15 order them to abate the nuisance by some amount, 16 informed by what information is available about methods. 17 And then - 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why is it less 19 intrusive - 20 MS. UNDERWOOD: Because - 21 JUSTICE BREYER: -- to try to get into the 22 details of how an electricity company will in fact run 23 its operation, than to say all you have to do is make a 24 change in the dollar sign that you charge for your 25 product?
62

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, because we're not 2 suggesting that the court would get into the details on 3 our theory, either. It would be the defendants that 4 would get into the details, that would figure out for 5 themselves what the best way was to meet these standards 6 -- to meet the objective. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: I wish Justice Breyer had 8 made this argument in the EPA case. I don't think the 9 EPA case - 10 (Laughter.) 11 MS. UNDERWOOD: And of course it's true that 12 if you conclude that the Federal statutes displace the 13 Federal -- and the Federal regulations displace the 14 Federal common law either now or in the future, then 15 under Ouellette, the same Federal statute that replaces 16 Federal common law will revive source State common law, 17 because of the savings clause in that statute, because 18 of a choice Congress made; and that result, while less 19 -- less respectful of the Federal interest in providing 20 Federal law to govern these disputes, would nevertheless 21 leave common law courts in the business that they're - 22 of attempting to address pollution problems. 23 The suggestion has been made that the EPA 24 has entered the field of greenhouse gas, and that's 25 enough, but it isn't just one field. It only seems like
63

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 one because the EPA once said the whole subject was off 2 limits and beyond their jurisdiction. Once that 3 obstacle is removed, there still remain a series of 4 programs under the statute, a series of kinds of sources 5 that need to be regulated. The Clean Air Act regulates 6 by substance and by source. It's a collection of 7 statutory programs, and taking action under one program 8 can't displace the common law as it applies to matters 9 outside that program. 10 It may well be that there will be a 11 regulation soon that displaces, but it would be very 12 surprising if this Court concluded that the promise of 13 regulation is enough to displace the Federal common law 14 as distinguished from the actuality of it. 15 The Court has suggested that a court might 16 impose standards that would conflict with what the EPA 17 is doing, but there's really no reason to think that 18 would happen because if what a court sets out to do is 19 find out what feasible methods there are for reduction 20 and then order the defendants to make reductions that 21 are feasible, that's a much less taxing inquiry, a much 22 less demanding inquiry than the EPA is likely ultimately 23 to make. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if the EPA comes up 25 with a different number? Would it -- than the one you
64

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 achieve in this litigation; would the EPA prevail? 2 Would the EPA's number prevail or your number prevail? 3 MS. UNDERWOOD: You mean an emission 4 reduction? 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, yes. I mean you - 6 MS. UNDERWOOD: If the EPA -- when the EPA 7 speaks, the EPA's rule will displace the Federal common 8 law. We're talking entirely - 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: And will displace the 10 judgment that has been obtained under Federal law? 11 MS. UNDERWOOD: If -- it would presumably 12 provide a basis for the defendant to go back to the 13 court and -- and vacate the judgment or alter the 14 judgment to comply with regulations, should that happen. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. And the court says 16 no? 17 MS. UNDERWOOD: That's what appellate courts 18 are here for, isn't it? 19 (Laughter.) 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess, just 21 to follow up, what is the appellate court reviewing? Is 22 it reviewing the reasonableness of EPA's judgment or the 23 continuing validity of the injunction it entered 24 previously? 25 MS. UNDERWOOD: The continuing validity of
65

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the injunction it entered previously because once the 2 EPA - 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that seems to be 4 a displacement of the normal process of administrative 5 law, which we would review the agency's determination of 6 how best and to what extent to regulate the emissions. 7 MS. UNDERWOOD: On a different litigation 8 track, it is -- would also be possible to challenge the 9 EPA's regulatory judgment, but in the case in which a 10 judgment had already been entered, it is the ordinary 11 litigation track to, if -- if intervening events make 12 equitable relief no longer equitable, to go back to the 13 court and ask the court to modify its injunction. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. And I guess 15 that's the central problem. Once you turn it over to 16 litigation, it's an entirely different set of standards 17 that would regulate emissions as opposed to the 18 standards that would apply with respect to an agency's 19 determination. 20 MS. UNDERWOOD: I don't think it's a 21 different set -- yes, one set of standards for reviewing 22 an agency's determination, but the ultimate standards 23 that are reached are going to be a level of emission 24 reduction through either process. 25 When the agency speaks to the question, the
66

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Federal common law is displaced. When it doesn't, and 2 during what could be a long period of time when it 3 doesn't, the States are entitled to a Federal law 4 governing their dispute. So we urge this Court to keep 5 the Federal courts open to States exercising their 6 historic power to protect their land and their citizens 7 from air pollution emitted in other States. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General 9 Underwood. 10 Mr. Keisler, you have five minutes 11 remaining. 12 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER 13 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 14 MR. KEISLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 15 Just a few points. 16 First, with respect to the merits and what 17 it would involve to adjudicate this case, Justice Kagan, 18 it is a -- there's a reason that this issue is so 19 fraught and difficult in international negotiations and 20 at the EPA and in the halls of Congress, and that's 21 because it requires policymakers to allocate burdens 22 among critical social goods in favor of important 23 environmental considerations; and the remedies that are 24 being considered are potentially transformative because 25 they involve the way we use and supply and pay for
67

1 energy. And the problems with courts attempting to 2 replicate what's going on in those venues are not simply 3 the matter is complex, although of course it's extremely 4 complex, but there is no legal principle here to guide 5 the decision. It's a question of trade-offs, how the 6 country wants to balance the projected environmental 7 risks and benefits against the projected economic 8 benefits and costs. 9 If Congress enacts a statute providing a 10 standard, then our political question argument goes 11 away. It's not that this is permanently off limits to 12 the judiciary. It's that it requires a standard. And 13 in a big intractable issue like this, Congress can often 14 create an orderly framework for consideration within a 15 statutory context, which it has done in part by enacting 16 the Clean Air Act. 17 And the final point I would make my friend 18 and I come at this really from opposite angles, in the 19 following sense, which is the plaintiffs say that this 20 is a deeply historically rooted cause of action with a 21 very strong and ancient pedigree, and therefore it can't 22 possibly present justiciability problems, under 23 standing, political question doctrines; and we say that 24 the very powerful standing and political question 25 obstacles that we think are apparent on the face of this
68

1 are a signal that this is nothing like the historical 2 cause of action that they've relied on. 3 To classify climate change as a tort would 4 trigger a massive shift of institutional authority away 5 from the politically accountable branches and to the 6 courts, which we think would be inconsistent with 7 separation of powers, and for those reasons we ask that 8 the Court reverse the judgment and direct that the case 9 be dismissed. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 11 Mr. Keisler, counsel.
