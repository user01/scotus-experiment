Our position that it is allows the Court to reach the critical question whether a relator has contributed genuinely valuable information. The position taken by Mr. Kirk and the Government would disallow the public disclosure bar before reaching that critical issue, and it would therefore lead to a host of lawsuits by relators with no meaningful information to contribute, and that is precisely the result that the public -- the public disclosure bar is intended to prohibit. Now -­"

    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, that may well be a legitimate use of a FOIA request, and the question then becomes whether the information disclosed in the FOIA response reveals the allegations and transactions upon which the qui tam suit is based. But that question, that use by a relator of the FOIA process, doesn't go to whether or not a FOIA response is itself a report or investigation within the statute. A relator can still escape the public disclosure bar if the relator can demonstrate that his complaint is not based upon the allegations and transactions that are disclosed in the FOIA response."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "So in each case, we'd have to tell what was the -- the false claims claim; was district court did in this very case in a very thorough opinion. Judge Stein went through every element required for the public disclosure bar to be invoked, including whether the FOIA response was a report or investigation, including whether Mr. Kirk's complaint was based on allegations and transactions disclosed in that FOIA response, and concluded that every prong of the disclosure -- public disclosure bar was met, and, therefore, the public disclosure bar prevented Mr. Kirk's claims. And that is precisely the analysis that we contend ought to happen. Under the Government's position and Mr. Kirk's position, you never get to the critical inquiries about whether the allegations in a relator's complaint were publicly disclosed in a report or investigation, because under their view, a FOIA response itself is rarely going to qualify as a -- as an administrative report or as an administrative investigation. We think that view is plainly incorrect statements to an administrative office, and then someone from the press has a Freedom of Information Act request to see that financial disclosure statement, does it then become -- does it become the report of the administrative office, rather than my report to the administrative office?"

I mean, there's surely different between those two kinds -- one, I would say, the natural understanding would be it's a report by the person who's filing it to the agency; and the other, where the agency puts personnel to investigate an issue, is a report of the agency. And you seem to say, no, they're all reports of the agency."

That's how I understand a government report. But it's very hard for me to understand how a report by Schindler becomes a government report simply because it is filed with the agency."

    "speaker": "REISS",

An antitrust investigation may require millions and millions of documents and take the Justice Department 4 years. it went to -- his request started out with the Department of Labor Office of Information. It was sent to the Division on Investigation and Compliance, located in a completely separate building. The response to his request was delivered by Mr. Robert Wilson, who is the chief of the Investigations and Compliance Division. His activity clearly constitutes an investigation, and the results that he gives to Mr. Kirk is clearly a report. There may be many other agency activities that are far more detailed, far more complex, but it doesn't make what is done in response to a FOIA request not a report or investigation. They are still reports and investigations within the ordinary meaning of those words."

    "speaker": "REISS",
    "speech": "Absolutely, Justice Alito. When -- when a FOIA response says, as it did in this case, we didn't -- say it says we didn't find certain documents; we did find certain documents. Here are the documents we found. The attachment of the documents that's found is part of the report, but the report is -­ is a complete report. We didn't find some things; we found these things, here are the things we found; they meet the description of what you asked for. The documents being attached are clearly part of the report. Now, we think that the position taken by the Government and the Respondent also creates fairly serious dislocations. Under the definition of \"report\" advanced by Mr. Kirk and the Government, many things that are actually called reports by statute are not reports. The Department of Labor's -- Department of Labor reports that it is required to file detailing its oversight and compliance of VEVRRA, the statute at issue the definition advanced by the Government and Kirk, because they require some element that appears nowhere in the public disclosure bar. They require an element of some kind of search for wrongdoing or fraud. That definition appears nowhere in the public disclosure bar."

If it doesn't indicate that, it doesn't qualify as a report. We think that crabbed definition of report is not the ordinary definition of report, and this Court has said innumerable times, including I've heard even today that the Court looks to the ordinary, regular meaning of terms. The ordinary meaning of \"report\" clearly encompasses every FOIA response. If there are no further questions, Mr. Chief Justice, I would reserve my time."

And we not -- we know that's not the choice that Congress made. It included only specifically enumerated sources, and it chose particular words. It chose report, hearing, audit or investigation. It is hard to think of what other words Congress could have used to describe the type of report we are talking about or the type of investigation besides those words.

And that's because there's a substantive distinction between an investigation, certainly between a GAO investigation, between a congressional investigation and what an agency does in response to a FOIA request.

    "speech": "I don't think I'll use it all, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Ginsburg, in response to your request, the new version of the False Claims Act lets the government disclaim the public disclosure bar. It now says the bar can apply unless opposed by the government. So the government has an automatic ability to stop the imposition of the public disclosure bar simply by opposing it. So that is a material change in the government's favor that the new False Claims Act has made. Let me just address an underlying premise and it's utterly belied by the statistics from the Department of Labor in terms of what their responses are and how they do them. In 2008, which was the last year we were able to find statistics for, the Department of Labor, the department at issue here, processed 17,000 FOIA responses. Only 28 percent were granted in full. Thirty-two percent were denied in full, 10 percent, based on the statutory exemptions, and 22 percent based on other statutes like the Privacy Act, and 40 percent of those 17,000 responses were partial responses. So we can give you some but not all; and in fact the FOIA responses in this very case not only reported that we found some of the VETS-100 reports in some years, we didn't find them in others; but with respect to the VETS-100 reports that were attached, they actually made redactions, because those redactions were compelled according to the Chief of Compliance and Investigations by the Privacy Act."

    "speech": "Exactly, Justice Sotomayor, but our position does not resurrect the government knowledge standard that Congress changed in 1986, and it doesn't do so for some very good reasons. First of all, the government -- the government knowledge standard that the legislative history in the Senate report, one of the primary concerns of Congress in enacting the statute in 1986 was the fact that there was a sense that government employees themselves who were knowledgeable about potential contracting fraud were not coming forward. In fact, the Senate report cites a 1983 survey in which 73 percent of 5,000 government employees responded they would not come forward with evidence of contractor fraud. That was a major concern with Congress under the old government knowledge standard, the pre-1986 government knowledge standard. Those -- if those employees came forward, the suit would still be barred because the government by definition would have known about the fraud. Under the new statute, not only do you have the original source exception, but if government employees come forward, they are not barred from bringing those qui tam suits. It's a major change and it's not the resurrection, Justice Sotomayor, of the government knowledge standard. 9:8,9 allegations 4:10 42:14 :17 basically 19:23 7:18 46:24 47:18 15:10 concerns 47:2 corporation1:3 9:21 37:6,24 17:1,3,3,4,18 31:23 good 18:17,18 6:16 41:18 28:23,24 investigate JONATHAN kind 11:18 14:4 4:18 41:7 Privacy 43:10,19 35:16,17 36:12 quite 35:3 36:24 referred19:7 :4,15,18,21 25:20 26:14,17 32:18 39:2,4,14 46:12 scope 36:3 46:14 :4,5,10,10,13 27:10,14,22 responding roads 30:5 screaming 44:8 :19,24 7:3,14 31:20 32:6,8 19:22 28:11 Robert 12:6 search 10:19,22 :15,18,19,25 38:8,10,24 42:2 response 3:12 ROBERTS 3:3 14:4 20:14  4:19 39:8 15:20 39:4,5 19:14 20:2,17 years 9:3,5,8,8 3 2:4 :12,13 30:1 27:7,12,17 York 1:15,15,17"
