    "speech": "That's correct, Justice O'Connor.  I mean, the argument --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "To reach your conclusion."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "That's correct.  The argument made by Respondent is essentially that Title 3 covers any person who is present at a place of public accommodation, whatever he or she is doing there, whether they are a customer, an employee or an independent contractor.  I think that's wrong for several reasons. First of all, just looking at the specific language that you point to, the notion of full and equal enjoyment of goods and services, it seems to me, is quite different from the notion of being allowed to provide the goods and services."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, Mr. Farr, you keep talking about goods and services, but the statute is not limited"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "Well, if I may separate this into two things, because the $3,000 applies only to a very small piece, which is the qualifying tournament. There is no requirement playing on the Tour itself or on the Nike Tour."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Right.  But that's, that's where you start.  That's where you start."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "But that's where one starts. But in terms of privilege, I'm using the term goods and services not to skip over the others, but simply as a shorthand reference to all of that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, except that it makes a difference because I think in a common sense kind of way we can say well, he is not getting any goods and services, but he is trying to exercise a privilege of playing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "Well, except for, it seems to me that frankly would have thought in this circumstance an easier way of looking at it would be not that he's supplying labor, but that he wants to play a game and if he plays the game well enough to win a prize. That's, that doesn't fall within the sort of aura of employment that Title 1 covers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "Well, I think it does, to be honest with you, Justice Souter.  For example, this happens to be a game of golf.  But if one thinks of the game of football, for example, professional football is a game that is played by employees.  They are, they are hired I think, basically by the teams. They compete against each other."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yeah.  And they get -- and each one of them gets paid by his employer win, lose or draw.  In this case, maybe, maybe you'll have to help me out here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, except that the statement is too broad.  The football industry, I suppose, does not say we will give anybody who wants to come in and compete for a place on our team a spot.  They are not going to invite me to try out. (Laughter). But as I understand it, that, that is what is at stake here.  Anybody who can start at the first qualifying level with his money and his references and keep on playing well enough is in a position the way the PGA is run to get to this top echelon of athletes and compete for a prize."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "I'm not sure what difference that makes, Justice Souter, because in a sense, anybody can compete to play on a professional football team.  I mean, professional football teams are drawn from the public at the other thing, as Justice Souter's privilege question indicated, it also offers to a subset of the public, a very talented subset from all over the world, the opportunity to win a prize.  And that's also part of its business.  It is offering an opportunity to win a prize."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "Well, the -- the thing that I think makes it more confusing, it seems, is that normally, our position would be that the opportunity to earn something, to start with, without using the words win a prize from it, but the opportunity to earn something would not be the kind of privilege or good or service that is being offered by a place of public accommodation.  Indeed, people who want to provide the inputs would be the kinds of people who wanted to provide services and earn what they would get in return.  I think what makes this case seem different is because what Respondent in fact does for a expenses as they play and then whatever they win over and above that, that will be their earnings. Now, our argument would be that in that arrangement, the Tour would clearly not be subject to suits by those golfers under Title 3."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- under Title 1."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "Because Title 1 is the title of this Act that deals with that kind of issue, the question of relationships between people who are providing labor and the people who are paying for it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well all that -- I mean, this -- that's true, that's it's a very, it's an unusual situation here, and we could go on forever about the pros and cons and who they are really like.  But people go to race accommodation, and I think you'd say the same about all the unusual cases we can think of.  Why should this make a difference?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "I think the difference between the examples you are using, Justice Breyer, and this example, is those, the people who go to the race tracks, some of whom may go to make a living, are essentially doing the same thing, receiving the same outputs, if you will, from the race track, as the people who are there simply for recreational purposes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So are these people because after all, the golf course is leased by the PGA to use to play golf for that day."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "But, but I think the difference, Justice Breyer, is that at the time the tournament is going on, in fact, there are no people there playing for"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "That's correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But I'm, I'm sure that you must have an answer to, the public accommodations provision is not new with the American disabilities. It comes up in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 where the concern is race.  Now, with respect to race, could the PGA say that we don't want any African-Americans to play in our game?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "Well, Title 2 does not apply, we believe, in the same circumstances as we don't think Title 3 of the ADA applies, to situations in which somebody is simply seeking to provide, seeking to obtain employment or trying to obtain work as an independent contractor, so Title 2 of the Civil Rights Act would not apply in that case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So your answer is the same for both? That neither public accommodation -- under the employment provisions because they're not employees, not coming under the employment provisions, they are not covered at all?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "Under the disabilities act, and not under Title 2.  Whether there are other provisions like Section 1981, for example, in the case of race, might extend protection in that situation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes.  But as far as the public accommodation is concerned, you are being consistent."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "The public accommodations provisions in our view are intended again to deal with essentially people who are consumers, clients and customers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Farr, can I just identify your theory a little better?  Are you contending that when the golf course is being used for a PGA tournament, it is not a place of public accommodation because of the limited"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But you are assuming that the golf course, even though for a specific purpose, continues to be a place of public accommodation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "That the area generally.  There is a difficulty.  I mean, one of the questions that one has is, is every piece of the property a place of public accommodation or is the -- are the ropes, for example, dividing a place of public accommodation from a place that isn't?  That is one way to look at it. In our view, the simpler way to look at it is the second way that you have which is to say, you have to be asking in this question, is the person an individual receiving the kind of goods, services and privileges that are covered?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I see.  I think you conceivably could have taken the position that when it's rented out for a course at this moment a place of exercise or recreation, as that's typically thought of under Title 3, our answer would be, I think the better view is no.  And the Ninth Circuit actually interestingly didn't say that it was a place of exercise or recreation and noted that we made the argument it wasn't and basically said be that as it may, it is a place of entertainment, and we -- and what we are saying is yes, it is a place of entertainment and there are people present at the tournaments who in fact are enjoying goods and service and enjoying the entertainment that we are providing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But it seems to me --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "But the golfers are part of the entertainment.  Excuse me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "We are talking about not something that's just a place, we are talking about the Tour, the fact that they are operating a place of public accommodation during the tournaments. You have to be operating a place of public accommodation before you become subject to Title 3."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I assume you could have a place of public accommodation on a cybernet or something that doesn't exist at any one place, and that's what, that's what this other dimension of this case is.  They are offering to everyone the opportunity to compete in the abstraction we call a tour, a circuit."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "But Justice Kennedy, the Tour isn't an abstraction.  The Tour literally is, are a series of events put on by a 501(c)(6) organization, a non-stock membership organization, and they are put on for the purposes of providing entertainment to the public.  That entertainment, it seems to me, is a product that they moment, and for example, the Seventh Circuit in the Olinger case just assumed that Title 3 did apply to the type of claim that the professional golfer there made.  If one assumes that, then the question is whether the modification that's requested here would fundamentally alter the nature of Tour events, and I think that where the Ninth Circuit went wrong on that particular question is that it never really came to grips with what professional athletics are. The professional athletics are as I said in the beginning, simply tests of excellence.  They are questions of who can perform the best a particular set of physical tasks, and those tasks are defined by the rules of the sport."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But, but the PGA has let down its requirements in a couple of cases.  One golfer had been"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And the thing that puzzles me is how it can be a fundamental rule that applies that does not apply in the qualifying events."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "Well, because the, the principal events that they put on are, of course, the events of the Tour themselves, the two highest level events.  Qualifying involves simply questions of logistics to be honest. There are, there are many more people who are playing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No.  If logistics are sufficient to justify use of a cart, why isn't this handicap sufficient?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "Well, first of all, let me make --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Because they are both trying to determine the quality of the golfer and it's not fundamental in qualifying schools but it is fundamental in the Tour event itself."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "Well, let me make one point. That Tour, which is the second level tour, the Tour has always required that all competitors observe all the same rules, including the walking rule. There have been no exceptions to that whatsoever."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Farr --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Farr, is your position then, clear position that there is no accommodation required in a professional sport competition, that the rules are whatever they are, and there is no requirement to adjust to any disability?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "I want to make clear two points. First of all, that when I talk about rules, I am talking about what we have called in the case substantive rules. And that is rules that are intended to and do have the potential to affect performance and the outcome of the tournament.  So first of all, when I'm using the term"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, you're familiar with both the law in the area and the game in your preparation for this, for this argument, so you could not think of any concrete example of where there would be any requirement to accommodate to a disability, that the game is the game?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "In a professional sport, I think that's true, that the purpose of a professional sport is one thing and one thing only.  It's to determine who is the best at doing a certain set of defined tasks.  If you change what the tasks are, if you change the rules that people have to comply with so that you have different rules for different players, you are not going to get an answer to the question of who is the best at that particular thing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Farr."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Your argument is -- Whereas, if we go on your second ground, mainly that it is a fundamental part of a sport, the Tour wouldn't be able to make such an exception, would it?  It would in effect be admitting that it is not a fundamental feature of the sport."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "I think our second argument is slightly different, Justice Scalia.  I agree with the first part to start with.  Yes.  I think if the Court would agree on the first issue that the Tour could, and I think the Tour could under the second, simply by changing what the rules of the sport are.  Our position is not that there is such a thing --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Of course you could change it for rule.  If there were such a way to tell, we think walking would be a fundamental rule.  But our position in fact is that all the substantive rules are fundamental rules."

    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "I think the difference in amateur sports and the thing that makes, makes the, when you apply the fundamental alteration language is that the fundamental, when you talk about fundamentally altering the nature of a particular good or service, that requires looking at what the nature of the particular good or service is.  The nature of a professional sport is very different, I think, from the nature of most amateur sports. Probably not all. nature of that, essentially amateur sports, most amateur sports have a dual nature.  They have a nature that involves sort of sorting winners from losers, but they also have a nature that says we are trying to get as many kids in the high school or whatever to play.  Professional sports are not --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why couldn't we make that same argument.  Why couldn't that same argument be made by anyone who provides an important public service?  You know, we have a bunch of rules, characteristics, qualifications.  We don't want courts in there weighing the importance of this good or service or privilege. Therefore, if it affects the nature of the good, service or privilege, it's fundamental, which is the argument you are making."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARR",
    "speech": "Well, if it's actually changing what there is a specific provision that says a public accommodation does not have to change its inventory to accommodate disabled people.  And the reason given for that in the preamble of the regulations is that Title 3 requirements are intended to assure access to the goods and services being provided, not to alter the mix in nature of the services typically provided. Now, typically provided in this context we would say are the tournaments with uniform rules, including the walking rule, at the very highest level.  That is one that has been typically provided. And the reason I think for that, and I think this goes to your question, Justice Breyer, is that in a sense, any store or commercial entity is just whatever its goods are, a bookstore.  An example is a bookstore does not have to stock braille, braille books.  And there isn't time.  We'll hear from you now, Mr. Reardon."

From 1965 until 1997, the PGA ran a Q School to determine --"

And the purpose of that Q School is to determine, it's a test of excellence, as Petitioner said, to determine who is the best and who can go on the Tour the following year.  It's something like 1,200 people, golfers from the public, who wanted to play on the PGA Tour.  And they came in, paid their money, had their references, and started to play, and they winnow it down to 168 players by the third stage. Every one of those 168 players is going to either go on the PGA Tour the next year or on the Nike Tour at the time, and none of those players need ever have walked a single hole, not only in the qualifying, but in their lives."

Who is the judge of whether a person is sufficiently disabled to get a dispensation from the nonfundamental walking requirement?  Is it up to the had done what I respectfully suggest the law demands of it, which was to take a look at the nature of the disability, the individual disability of Casey Martin, rather than returning his medical records without looking at them, and returning the tape demonstrating the gravity of his problem, they would have seen the disability and in those circumstances --"

Other rules are like whether you look at the baseball before you throw it or hold it to your chest, which isn't part of the game, at least not an essential part.  Now, how did we find out which is which because the question was raised and I want to be clear what the answer to that is, and how do we find out?  Not we, me personally.

It's just an acknowledgment of who has the best expertise, who knows the most about it, who is best equipped to make the walking rule is never a fundamental -- abandoning the walking rule, it would never be a fundamental rule, or are you contending that with respect to Casey Martin, it's not fundamental because his disability has the same impact on his ability to play as walking has on other people?  Which is your theory?"

And when you look at the way they handled the exceptions throughout, this is the over 50s, just last week in Hawaii, and this is not in the brief, but examples like this are in the brief.  There are a couple of holes out in Hawaii on the Mercedes championship that were difficult for the players to negotiate because they were hilly.  They took them by cars."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but -- the game can -- we're not talking about the game in the abstract. We're talking about the PGA Tour, and if the people who make the rules for the PGA Tour say we want to make this particular game tougher than regular golf games, we are going to separate another subset of people by making them walk, or at least making them walk on most holes.  Everybody has to play by this rule.  Why, if that could be outcome determinative, is that not a, number one, a reasonable way for them to draw the line, and why shouldn't we respect it?"

It wouldn't be fundamental within the meaning."

There was counter-testimony that said the exhaustion came from dehydration, not from walking, and there was spectators at that event who were passing out. They weren't doing any walking."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
    "speech": "Well, that's rather like the fact that a university that, that offers, to which the public can apply doesn't then admit the whole public.  It has a selection process, and so what only, only the admitted people can attend, but the university is a public accommodation."

    "speech": "Why is that any different with respect to employees?  Couldn't you say that awful your employees are enjoying the opportunity to work for you in the place of public accommodation in which you employ them?  That seems to me perfectly parallel to saying that these professional golfers who are making money by, by putting on this entertainment are enjoying the opportunity to do that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
    "speech": "You might be able to say that. There are two -- the words would allow you to say that. There are two reasons why you wouldn't. One is that Congress made very clear that it was covering employees in Title 1 and that it didn't intend to provide redundant coverage in Title 3 so whatever one might say ab initio, that possibility is excluded."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Independent contractors would be here.  The golfer does not, does not undertake any obligation to perform, even in the way that an independent contractor does.  He is simply --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
    "speech": "He doesn't make a commitment to -- it's my understanding of the record that he doesn't make a commitment.  It is true that if he doesn't appear, he won't be in the Tour anymore, but he, by qualifying and being eligible to be in the Tour does not make a commitment to participate."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, that's just like saying an independent contractor doesn't have to comply with his contract there.  The only thing is if he doesn't, he gets fired.  I mean, it's the same thing. Tour explained in the district court when they were attempting to defeat the claim that this was an employee, that it doesn't hire golfers, that it's a membership organization, a professional association that arranges playing opportunities for its members and promotes their interests.  It compared itself to the ABA in that regard. It provides opportunity for them.  It provides services for them."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "May I -- may I ask you, Ms. Underwood, if whether to decide in your favor, we have to determine the general applicability of Title 3 of the ADA to independent contractors?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
    "speech": "No, you do not.  In the -- that is, the, the particular sort of entity or status of Respondent here is, as I said, a much clearer case that he is a consumer of the services or the privileges or court said he is not an employee, and looked to the body of law that said people who aren't employees are independent contractors.  But I don't think that resolves the question whether he maybe was something else entirely, a member or a potential member who was neither an employee nor an independent contractor as that term is commonly used in the working context. He simply wasn't a worker here at all. Petitioner argues that players can't be consumers of services because they are providers of entertainment to the spectators, but that is simply a false dichotomy.  PGA offers services to these two different groups.  It arranges playing opportunities for golfers and viewing opportunities for the spectators.  As a result, players both consume and provide services at the same time, just like the little league players who have said, I think there is an argument that even those independent contractors could be covered, that the Disability Act meant to open economic and social life to people with disabilities and that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Let's -- let's assume I disagree with that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
    "speech": "Yes.  I think the simple answer here is that the privilege of working for, for money in an employee-like role is simply quite different from what is happening when somebody participates in a competition. The public accommodations laws, as we said earlier, protect gamblers at a casino, or exhibitors at a craft fair, or participants in a dance contest, whether there are money prizes or not, whether the people who are engaging in those competitions.  I mean, I think the -- are doing it to make their living or are doing it as an assume that we think that that's what these golfers are doing.  What's the difference?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
    "speech": "The difference is that the participation in a contest is a different sort of, that is open to the public, is a different sort of thing from the cut from the arrangement by contract, by employment contract or by some other contract to provide services. And I'd like to point out, of course, that covering people like independent contractors or like contest participants, which is what we have here under Title 3 is not as has been suggested some sort of end run around the limitations of Title 1."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Are you then distinguishing the stage -- one analogy that was made is the spectators are in the theater, but what's going on in the stage, those people are not relating to the space as a public accommodation. discriminated against as a consumer of that facility. That's not usually the way performers relate to performance space."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "In your opinion, does it make a difference if, if there is no easy classification, that is, if a professional golfer is somehow unique, not this, not some other thing, not an employee, not a contractor, not a client, not exactly a customer, not a this, not a that.  Does it matter?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "UNDERWOOD",
    "speech": "Well, I think that the purpose of the Disabilities Act was to, was to be inclusive.  I think that's clear both from the statute and from the legislative history so that I would suggest that if there's, that doubts should be resolved here in favor of coverage.  But I don't think it's unclear.  I think that, that the, that the public accommodations title was meant me.  Just a few brief points. Responding in reverse order to the United States' argument, first of all, they say that the reason that employers, employees are not covered by Title 3 is because that covers Title 1, but Title 1 doesn't cover all employees.  It only covers employees of a covered employer.  You have to have at least 15 employees to be covered and if you are not an employee of a covered employer, you are not covered either.  Yet, the United States' position is that no employees are covered by Title 3, but really independent contractors or people similar to that are in the same position essentially with respect to Title 3 as noncovered employees under Title 1. Secondly, the district court specifically said that Respondent was an independent contractor, not just in talking about Title 1, but on page 53 of the joint is not a consumer of goods and services, and there are a number of people who are not consumers.  Employees are in the group. Independent contractors are in the group. Partners in a law firm, which is a type of public accommodation, are not in the group.  Insurance agents are not in the group.  The issue is what they are not.  They are not people obtaining, seeking to obtain or gain access to goods and services.  They are all in the category of people who are providing goods and services to the public accommodation so it in turn can provide its goods and services to other people. Secondly, just to make the contrast between the people who are also playing golf and who are covered, Title 3, we concede, it covers commercial opportunities, recreational opportunities, educational opportunities. Those are all things specifically mentioned in Title 3 in Now, just quickly on the points that Respondent raises, Rule 1.1 doesn't say golf is a sport of hitting the ball from the tee to the putting hole.  It says it's a game of hitting it from the tee to the putting hole in accordance with the rules. That is Rule 1.1. And the rules for this particular competition include, as there are permitted to be, optional rules, and that in turn includes the requirement that competitors walk the course.  So if you, if you are saying that you cannot, that you have to make waivers in that situation for someone who can't comply, then you are changing the game."
