It helps -- there is a paradox here. To the extent that a State attempts to this Court -- as the Ninth Circuit did, is to look at whether California performed a proper Clemons review, which is that the appellate court looks to see whether The Ninth Circuit held that there was no such principled and complete review, because -- California, in fact, did do what Chapman said.

Why is it not a \"weighing\" State when it says that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KIRKLAND",
    "speech": "Because the word \"weigh\" isn't the talisman for the process that the jury goes through. \"Weigh\" is a normative process that -- opposing counsel have made the point that, in the 1977 law, which everybody agreed was a \"non-weighing\" law, that when we injected the word \"weigh\" into the 1978 capital sentencing statute, that that changed this. But the California Supreme Court made clear, in its Frierson decision, that, as far as California is concerned, the process -- the mental process that the jury goes through under either statute is the same, that \"weigh,\" \"consider,\" \"balance,\" so on, none has a talismanic thing. It's just a metaphorical description for the jury's normative evaluation. So, the term \"weigh\" is not dispositive."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "And the term \"concluding that it does outweigh\" is something different from \"weighing.\"  in California, too, a critical thing is that that \"aggravating circumstances\" mean the sentencing factors that militate in favor of death; it doesn't mean that \"eligibility circumstance.\" It refers to those sentencing factors. I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal."

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Thank you, Ms. Kirkland. Ms. Rivkind. account, and be guided by the listed enumerated factors.\" The special circumstances, as the questions from the Court have noted, are specifically included. Factor (a) has two independent components, and one is the existence of any \"special circumstance\" finding. As Justice Stevens noted, this could only be considered aggravating. It is, after all, the reason that California has said that this case moved from being an ordinary murder to being one that was worthy of either death or life without parole."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "But it's not -- it's prefaced by circumstances of the crime."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "And this State, and other States, can determine, \"Oh, the victim was in fear for a long time, or was tortured.\" It seems very odd that a State, which is a so-called \"non-weighing\" State, could allow all of this same evidence to come in, but California, which tries to give some structure, is suddenly held to a higher standard. That's paradoxical."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "RIVKIND",
    "speech": "Well, no, I think it's not, and I think it's very consistent with what we see in Mississippi. In California, factor (a) contains two independent components. One is the \"circumstances of the crime,\" and one is the \"special circumstances.\" The California Supreme Court, both before it affirmed Mr. Sanders' death sentence and after -- before, in a case, People versus Hamilton, and after, in People versus Benson circumstances, said that it presumes the jury follows its instructions, and considers the special circumstances time of Clemons, all of the categories of capital murder and the aggravating circumstances, much as there is in Louisiana. However, there are two additional aggravating \"heinous, atrocious, and cruel\" aggravator, which, in Mississippi, is only a selection factor, and whether the  \"The jury shall weigh the aggravating circumstances,\" which are -- have been specified and which are narrowing circumstances; there are only five named in the statute -- true against the mitigating,\" and it turns out that one of those five aggravating circumstances is unconstitutional.  the nature of a statute will inform a court's prejudice analysis. But Mr. Sanders went into the penalty phase essentially with four weights on death's side of the scale, based solely on the special circumstances, and two of those weights should not have been there. And his jury was given a very --"

    "speaker": "RIVKIND",
    "speech": "I have two responses, Your Honor. First, the rule -- the distinction between \"weighing\" and \"non-weighing\" is not an evidentiary rule. It is a rule about the statutory labels that a State gives to the factors that the jury puts on death's side of the scale. And that's the conclusion that the --"

    "speaker": "RIVKIND",

Bacigalupo did not deal with the question of invalid special circumstances being weighed at the penalty As I understood this area, to go back to what Justice Scalia was saying -- no, wait, just -- I'll back up to try to get you to correct my misunderstanding -- 'non-weighing' State\" -- that is, everything's relevant but the kitchen sink -- \"the fact that the prosecutor made cases are wrong?

The trial court made it very clear to him, that wasn't an option."

The first is that, as to the claim -- Ms. Rivkind's claim, that she's reiterated here, that the California Supreme Court has determined that the \"special circumstances\" label has some independent weight that it's important for the jury to consider at sentencing -- she's only cited half of the sentence in Benson and Hamilton. The other half rebuts her claim. The sentence is, \"Although we presume that the jurors followed their instructions and considered the invalid special circumstances finding, independent of thier underlying facts\" -- that's what she relies on -- they say, then, as they've said in a number of cases, \"we cannot conclude that they could reasonably have given them any independent significant weight.\" So, it's just the point we're making. It's just a label that does not carry with it any independent significant weight, because the evidence, the argument, the circumstances are all before the jury in the same way. The second point is that, while there may be in this case, there's no question as to his complete culpability in the crime. He was the leader. He led circumstance, and our sentencing factors, would be completely mutually exclusive and there would be no issue whatsoever."
