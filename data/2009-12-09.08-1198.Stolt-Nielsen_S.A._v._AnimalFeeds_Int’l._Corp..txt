1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:02 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 4 argument first today in Case 08-1198, Stolt-Nielsen S.A. 5 v. AnimalFeeds International. 6 Mr. Waxman. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 Unlike courts, arbitrators derive their 12 authority solely from the consent of the parties to a 13 particular agreement. 14 That agreement determines not only what the 15 parties have agreed to arbitrate, but just as 16 fundamentally, with whom they have agreed to do so. And 17 when the agreement reveals no intent, no meeting of the 18 minds to add participants, but the arbitrators 19 nonetheless extend their reach to hundreds of parties of 20 other contracts, they violate the basic principle 21 reflected in the FAA that their authority is created and 22 circumscribed by an agreement. 23 The decision to impose class proceedings is 24 not the kind of incidental procedural matter that 25 arbitrators have to resolve in order to discharge their
3 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 responsibilities under the foundational agreement. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, there's a 3 preliminary question in this case, and that is: There 4 was one agreement, undoubtedly signed by both sides, 5 and that was the one to submit to the arbitrator the 6 question whether the arbitration clause permitted class 7 treatment. 8 The arbitrators answered that question, 9 which they were given authority to do so by both sides, 10 and the Second Circuit said that the arbitrators 11 answered within the ballpark. 12 If we agree with that, then there's nothing 13 else to consider in this case. 14 MR. WAXMAN: I respectfully disagree, 15 Justice Ginsburg. The arbitrators -- the agreement 16 reflected in paragraph 7 of the supplemental agreement 17 -- that is, to proceed to arbitration under the auspices 18 of Rules 3 through 7 of the AAA rules, and Rule 3 itself 19 contemplated precisely submitting precisely the 20 contract issue that the Bazzle plurality said should go 21 to the arbitrators. That is, looking at the arbitration 22 clause itself, does it objectively reveal an agreement 23 among the two parties to permit or prohibit class or 24 consolidated treatment, or is it truly silent? 25 That is a question of contract
4 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 interpretation. That is the question that was submitted 2 to the arbitrators. 3 There is a separate statutory question that 4 arises if the answer to the contract question is number 5 3. There is no meeting of the minds. It is truly 6 silent -7 JUSTICE BREYER: But there is no such answer. 8 MR. WAXMAN: Excuse me. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought, in contracts, 10 there is no such answer. When you interpret a contract 11 and it doesn't say, you try to figure out -- I used to 12 be taught that; probably I am way out-of-date -- you try 13 to figure out what a reasonable party would have 14 intended. 15 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer -16 JUSTICE BREYER: And I thought that's what 17 Bazzle said, that -18 MR. WAXMAN: I very -- I very much doubt 19 that you are way out-of-date. If you are, I shudder to 20 think where I am. But let me be clear -21 JUSTICE BREYER: Not as out-of-date. 22 (Laughter.) 23 MR. WAXMAN: I hope I am as up-to-date as I 24 need to be to provide a coherent, correct answer. 25 My proposition is twofold, and only the
5 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 second part gets to your question. 2 The first is that the arbitrators in this 3 case decided the contractual question, the -- did the 4 parties have a meeting of the minds, yes or no? And if 5 so, was it? 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 7 MR. WAXMAN: And the arbitrators then went 8 on to say: Even though there is no meeting of the minds 9 objectively revealed, nonetheless we are going to apply 10 a background rule that puts the burden on the party 11 opposing arbitration to prove that there is an intent to 12 preclude. 13 So, we're establishing that the -14 JUSTICE BREYER: I see that now, but then -15 but there are two separate questions. 16 MR. WAXMAN: Exactly. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: My question was, first, the 18 same as Justice Ginsburg. 19 MR. WAXMAN: And I have an answer -20 JUSTICE BREYER: And I have a question for 21 you on that, because in reading these briefs, I thought 22 your description of who is to decide this matter of 23 whether there is to be a class action was just what you 24 said: The question of who should decide it is a matter 25 for the parties.

1 MR. WAXMAN: The question -2 JUSTICE BREYER: So when I looked at -- I 3 just have been reading Bazzle three, five times, and there 4 seemed -5 MR. WAXMAN: Well, you are nowhere near up 6 to me, then. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But what it 8 seems to say is that that's a matter to figure out from 9 a contract and background circumstances. In Bazzle, 10 the contract was: Any -- all disputes relating to this 11 contract. 12 Here, it doesn't say that. It says: "Any 13 dispute arising from the performance, termination, or 14 making of the contract." 15 Now, a class-action determination does 16 relate to. Maybe it doesn't arise out of, okay? That's 17 an argument. 18 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. No, no, no -19 JUSTICE BREYER: So why are all these briefs 20 saying that what Bazzle said was: Whenever this is 21 silent, it goes to the arbitrator; the who question is 22 answered at arbitration. 23 I can't find it saying that. 24 MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. What -- and I -- I'm 25 interpreting the plurality opinion that you wrote -- or
7 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 you and three of your colleagues. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I know. I know. But 3 what I actually thought doesn't matter. What matters is 4 what is said. 5 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. Well, our 6 understanding -- what Bazzle said is, at the very 7 beginning of the opinion -- look, here's the case: The 8 South Carolina Supreme Court found that the arbitration 9 clause is truly silent, and it then applied a rule of 10 State law that says, if it's silent, class treatment 11 will be permitted. We granted certiorari in this case 12 to decide whether that rule of South Carolina law 13 applied to this case is precluded by the FAA, which 14 requires actual consent, not coercion. 15 Now, what the plurality in Bazzle, with 16 respect, said is: We can't reach the legal question, 17 the statutory FAA question on which we granted review, 18 because we can't be certain that the contract really is 19 silent. To be sure, there's no express provision, but 20 Bazzle -- the Bazzle plaintiffs say that it is silent, 21 and Green Tree says, no, if you look at other words in 22 it, including the right to choose each arbitrator for 23 each arbitration, it's not -- the South Carolina courts 24 answered the question, but they are not the ones, 25 because when you are talking about a question of the
8 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 interpretation of a contract that has committed to 2 arbitration, that is for the arbitrators to decide. The 3 arbitrators have to decide whether there was actually a 4 meeting of the minds. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, you're -- so the 6 answer to Justice Ginsburg's question is, as to the who 7 question, who shall decide whether or not in your case 8 class actions are permissible? 9 MR. WAXMAN: And the -10 JUSTICE BREYER: The who question in Bazzle, 11 because of the contract and background, was the 12 arbitrator. 13 MR. WAXMAN: If -- yes. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: The who question here, 15 irrespective of the contract is the arbitrator for the 16 reason that Justice Ginsburg said. There's a separate 17 saying: You are the who; you, arbitrators, are the who. 18 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: So now we look to the what. 20 They then decided it. 21 MR. WAXMAN: Exactly. So in Bazzle -22 JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what did they decide? 23 And you are saying that's wrong. And there you run into 24 all the authority, Misco, who used to be in other 25 places, saying when the arbitrator says something,
9 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 unless it's in Marrs, follow it. That's what you are 2 addressing. 3 MR. WAXMAN: Right. Exactly. And -- and this 4 case presents exactly the same answer to that question 5 that Bazzle presented when it was granted review; that 6 is, there is -- there was an interpretation of the 7 contract in Bazzle, and an application of a legal 8 principle to that interpretation. The who for what -9 what the parties actually intended is the arbitrator. 10 That's what the Bazzle plurality, together with Justice 11 Stevens, both decided. 12 The question that arises, the legal question 13 that arises, only if the arbitrators say there was no 14 meeting of the minds: So what rule does the FAA allow 15 us to apply as a matter of Federal law? That is for 16 courts, and you didn't reach it because the preliminary 17 question of whether the contract was really silent, the 18 predicate question, wasn't answered. And you remanded 19 for that -20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Waxman, can I ask this 21 preliminary question? Assume the contract expressly 22 authorized class arbitration. Would you agree that was 23 permissible? 24 MR. WAXMAN: If it expressly authorized it? 25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.
10 Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. WAXMAN: If it expressly authorized 2 class participation, obviously, we would have no 3 argument that the parties had not agreed to it. 4 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand, but would 5 you agree that would be consistent with the law, to 6 enforce such a provision? 7 MR. WAXMAN: My -- I have a -8 JUSTICE STEVENS: That is, does the Federal 9 statute prohibit that kind of provision? 10 MR. WAXMAN: No, certainly not. 11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Oh. 12 MR. WAXMAN: I mean, the only reason -- the 13 only reason I'm hedging -- and I don't mean to hedge, but 14 trying to be thoughtful -- is that this Court explained 15 in Mitsubishi, in the context of the arbitration of a 16 Sherman Act agreement, and subsequently in Gilmer and 17 other statutory cases, that in determining whether class 18 participation or some other form of remedy is or isn't 19 available, there is a two-part inquiry. 20 The first part is: What was the scope of 21 the arbitration agreement? What is it that the parties 22 have agreed -23 JUSTICE STEVENS: And you would agree that 24 if they phrased their order a little differently and 25 said we think that the best reading of this agreement
11 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 is that the parties intended to authorize class 2 arbitration, then you would have no case? 3 MR. WAXMAN: Then we would have review only 4 under the -- I don't know that I would characterize it 5 this way, but what Justice Breyer characterized, the 6 Marrs standard of review; that is, you would have to 7 show -8 JUSTICE STEVENS: That there was manifest 9 disregard ­10 MR. WAXMAN: -- manifest disregard, and a 11 manifest -12 JUSTICE STEVENS: And you would not contend 13 -- you are not arguing that that would be manifest -14 MR. WAXMAN: No, our -- and the petition in 15 this case presented the question as given, presented the 16 issue of contract construction as given, that the 17 contract itself was silent, not only in the sense that 18 it didn't include an express provision or prohibition, 19 but also that it reflected no meeting of the minds. It 20 objectively revealed no meeting of the minds, looking 21 not only at the actual text of the contract, but also 22 looking at the other indicia -- objective indicia of 23 intent that courts use to -24 JUSTICE STEVENS: What, in your view -25 what, in your view, were the arbitrators asked to decide
12 Alderson Reporting Company

1 by the submission by the parties? 2 MR. WAXMAN: The arbitrators were asked to 3 decide whether the arbitration agreement objectively 4 reveals consent to prohibit, permit -- whether it 5 reveals a meeting of the minds to prohibit class 6 treatment, permit class treatment, or whether it was 7 truly silent. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: Didn't you just -9 MR. WAXMAN: And if you look at -10 JUSTICE ALITO: Didn't you just say that the 11 parties agreed that there was no meeting of the minds on 12 this issue? 13 MR. WAXMAN: Well, no, no, no. The 14 parties that -- I mean -- we actually -- let me step 15 back and give -- and give the history of it. 16 This case arose immediately in the wake of 17 Bazzle. Okay? They sued in court; we obtained an order 18 affirmed by the Second Circuit sending them to 19 arbitration. Bazzle is decided, and we're all looking 20 at Bazzle, and we decide -- like the AAA, which has 21 filed an amicus brief in this case, and said it drafted 22 these rules in order to provide a procedure to answer 23 the Bazzle contract interpretation question; the AAA 24 says, we don't have any view about the statutory 25 question that arises from silence -- so we drafted a
13 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 supplemental agreement that, in paragraph 7, 2 incorporates the AAA Rules 3 through 7. 3 And the AAA Rule 3, which is included on 4 page 56 of the joint appendix, is headed "Construction 5 of the Arbitration Clause." And it requires the 6 arbitrators in this arbitration to determine, quote, "on 7 construction of the arbitration clause, whether the 8 applicable arbitration clause permits the arbitration to 9 proceed on behalf of or against a class." The, quote, 10 "clause construction award." 11 Now, the legal -- the arbitrators in this 12 case concluded that it neither permitted nor prohibited, 13 either by its express terms or by reference to other 14 objective indicia of intent -15 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm a little bit puzzled. I 16 don't understand how something -- if you ask 17 whether something permits it, and if it doesn't prohibit 18 it, doesn't it a fortiori permit it? 19 MR. WAXMAN: It -- in the context of the 20 Federal Arbitration Act, which this Court has made clear 21 more times than I can remember that the central purpose 22 is to ensure that private agreements to arbitrate are 23 enforced according to their terms, the question is: 24 Have the parties agreed to it if there is a meeting of 25 the minds?
14 Alderson Reporting Company

1 If no meeting of the minds is objectively 2 revealed, under the FAA, the arbitrator exceeds his 3 authority in requiring class arbitration. It's -- there 4 is no consent. And if there is no consent, the legal 5 rule under -- the hallmark principle of the FAA is this 6 is a private consensual matter. This is not a court 7 exercising public coercive authority. I mean, the -8 JUSTICE ALITO: What is your understanding 9 of what Mr. Persky says at 77a of the joint appendix? 10 He was -- I take it he was counsel for AnimalFeeds? Is 11 that right? 12 MR. WAXMAN: Correct. He -13 JUSTICE ALITO: And he says all the parties 14 agree that when a contract is silent on an issue, there 15 has been no agreement that has been reached on that 16 issue; therefore, there has been no agreement to bar 17 class arbitrations. 18 MR. WAXMAN: Right. I -19 JUSTICE ALITO: So then I don't understand 20 what issue there was for the arbitrator to -21 arbitrators to decide -22 MR. WAXMAN: They -23 JUSTICE ALITO: -- other than to impose a rule 24 like the rule that had been adopted by South Carolina. 25 But that would not be within their power, unless they

1 could presumably find that rule in Federal maritime law 2 or New York law. 3 MR. WAXMAN: Correct. I mean -4 JUSTICE ALITO: So what was the issue for 5 them to decide? 6 MR. WAXMAN: So here's was -- here's what the 7 issue was. They said the contract is completely silent 8 and, as you quoted on page 77, the part -- there's no 9 meeting of the minds on this issue at all. That was 10 their position about the construction of the contract. 11 Our position about the construction of the 12 contract was that, in fact, although there is no express 13 provision one way or the other, this is a maritime 14 contract, and the -- and maritime law is ascertained by 15 custom and practice. And we introduced evidence in the 16 form of affidavits that were unrefuted that since the 17 days of Marco Polo, these types of spot voyages have 18 been -19 JUSTICE BREYER: That -- isn't that -- you 20 and I have a contract. I'll ship you 17 pounds of durum 21 wheat, and you will pay me $43. In the meantime, a 22 green worm eats up all the durum wheat, and therefore 23 they can't send durum wheat; they send some duhu wheat. 24 All right? Question: Is the contract 25 valid or not?

1 MR. WAXMAN: I don't owe you. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: Answer: We have courts for 3 that purpose. We have arbitrators for that purpose. 4 MR. WAXMAN: Exactly. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Arbitrators will look to 6 see what it says. If it says nothing, they will try to 7 determine what the parties thought. If they can't 8 determine what they thought, they will look to custom, 9 analogy, et cetera. Now -10 MR. WAXMAN: No. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: They won't? 12 MR. WAXMAN: In -- in the -- in the context 13 of -- in the context of a court that has jurisdiction 14 over a dispute and exercises coercive power, it has to 15 get to an answer. 16 When you are talking about private 17 arbitration, where the model is a private agreement to 18 resolve things between two parties, this -- under the 19 FAA, the arbitrators get their authority only as to 20 matters as to which there is consent. 21 And there is -- going to Justice Alito's 22 question, there was consent. It was submitted for 23 purpose of determining whether -- if you look at the 24 contract and look at background rules and look at parol 25 evidence and look at custom and practice, can you
17 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 discern whether, as -- as you put it in -- in the 2 opinion in Howsam, Justice Breyer, whether the contract, 3 quote, "objectively reveals an agreement" by the two 4 parties. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's the same before 6 courts. That's no different. I mean, yes, a court has 7 to come to a decision, but so does an arbitrator. And I 8 really -- I really don't understand what it means to say 9 that the contract does not cover it. I mean, the -- the 10 contract either requires it or does not require it. 11 And if the contract is silent, either the 12 court or the arbitrator has to decide what is the 13 consequence of that silence, in light of the background, 14 in light of -- of implied understandings. Is the 15 consequence of the -- of the silence that a class 16 arbitration is permitted, or is the consequence of the 17 silence that it is not? 18 But those are the only answers. The 19 contract requires it or the contract doesn't require it. 20 I don't know anything in between -- the contract is 21 silent. If the contract is silent, it's up to the court 22 or the arbitrator to decide what that silence means. 23 MR. WAXMAN: Exactly. And -- and maybe the 24 ambiguity here is the fluidity of the term "silence." 25 "Silence" can mean there's no express
18 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 provision. "Silence" could also mean, well, if you look 2 at other words in the text of the contract, you can't 3 work your way through to conclude that there was in fact 4 an intent. 5 It also may mean -- and this is the sense 6 that I am using it in, and I think the sense that the 7 arbitrators have authority to do, is to say, well, 8 let's look and see, for example, if there is custom and 9 practice that would inform the backdrop against which 10 the parties negotiate. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and why is it that 12 you say an arbitrator cannot do that, but a judge can? 13 MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no, I think an 14 arbitrator can. The arbitrator has plenary authority, 15 subject to manifest disregard review, to decide whether 16 or not there was a meeting of the minds of the parties. 17 And it can use the text of the statute; it can use an 18 applicable background principle of governing law; it can 19 use principles like contra proferentem, as this Court 20 did in -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But are they situated and 22 do they have the same authority as a court would in 23 determining that issue, given the fact that it was 24 remitted to them to decide? 25 MR. WAXMAN: They have plenary authority to
19 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 apply rules of construction that go to the parties' 2 intent, that go to whether there is -- possible to discern 3 a meeting of the minds. They don't have -4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you would -- would you 5 describe -- would you describe the authority of a court 6 any differently than you've just described the authority 7 of an arbitrator? 8 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think that courts can 9 -- for example, a court can say -- and the other side 10 relies heavily on a Seventh Circuit opinion by Judge 11 Posner, where he basically says: There is no intent 12 here, but courts apply contract constructions that seem 13 most sensible as a matter of public policy, and that's 14 what we are going to do. 15 That's what a court can do and an arbitrator 16 can't. The arbitrator can use any tools possible, 17 including, largely, the text and custom and practice, in 18 order to define whether or not there was a meeting of 19 the minds. But if there wasn't -20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do I have to agree with 21 Judge Posner on that? I mean I -- I don't -22 MR. WAXMAN: I think it's a radical 23 proposition -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: You would -- yes, you -25 MR. WAXMAN: -- as a matter of what courts can
20 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 do, but it certainly doesn't express what an arbitrator 2 can do. And he was -- he was performing the kind of 3 function, ostensibly, that you said that should be done 4 by an arbitrator in Bazzle. He was doing it as a court. 5 But arbitrators have to construe the 6 agreement itself between the two parties to see if there 7 is a meeting of the minds. And there are lots of tools 8 they can use. 9 And just to get back to your question, 10 Justice Alito -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -12 MR. WAXMAN: I'm sorry -- in this case, we 13 said the contract was not truly silent, that -14 essentially, we argued what Judge Rakoff concluded. 15 They said: No, no, no; it is truly silent, but you 16 should rule for us on other grounds. And may I please 17 ask the Court, if you have it, to turn to page 22 of our 18 blue brief, because on page 22 of our blue brief we have 19 reprinted exactly what AnimalFeeds told the arbitrators 20 were the reasons why they should win, in light of Mr. 21 Persky's statement that there was no meeting of the 22 minds. And it is the indented paragraph. 23 This is all that they said: "The parties' 24 arbitration clause should be construed to allow class 25 arbitration because (a) the clause is silent on the
21 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 issue of class treatment, and without express 2 prohibition, class arbitration is permitted under 3 Bazzle." The arbitrator said: No, that's not what 4 Bazzle means. Bazzle doesn't mean that unless there's 5 an express prohibition, it's -- it's permitted. So that 6 was their reason number one. 7 Let's go to their reason number 3. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the arbitrators 9 say that? 10 MR. WAXMAN: They said it in -- pardon me 11 while I get the page. 12 Page 49a: "Claimants argue that Bazzle 13 requires clear language that forbids class arbitration 14 in order to bar a class action. The panel, however, 15 agrees with Respondents that the test is a more general 16 one. Arbitrators must look to the language of the 17 parties' agreement to ascertain the parties' intention, 18 whether they intended to permit or to preclude class 19 arbitration." 20 Now, let's go back to what they told the 21 arbitrators, and it's reprinted on page 22. I am going 22 to skip -23 JUSTICE STEVENS: But let me just, right 24 there, interrupt with one question. The alternatives 25 before the arbitrator were whether it is permitted or
22 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 precluded? 2 MR. WAXMAN: Or was silent. 3 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, that's not what they 4 said there, is it? That -- that the parties agree they're 5 silent -- that whether they -- if they are silent, 6 whether they permit or preclude class action. Those are 7 the two alternatives that they were confronted with. 8 They decided that it did not preclude; ergo, it 9 permitted. 10 MR. WAXMAN: Well -11 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's what the answer to 12 that on page 49a is. 13 MR. WAXMAN: No, with -- with respect -- and 14 I'll -- let me answer this question -15 JUSTICE STEVENS: You -16 MR. WAXMAN: -- before getting back to the 17 -- what that -- what -- look, you -- you may find, 18 contrary to the cert grant in this case, that the 19 predicate of our petition is wrong. 20 Our petition is predicated on the 21 understanding that the arbitrators found that the 22 contract was truly silent; that is, it expressed no 23 meeting of the minds. And, therefore, this case 24 presents the question -25 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the question you were
23 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 asked was whether that silence should be interpreted as 2 a preclusion or a permission. 3 MR. WAXMAN: And we know from the 4 arbitrators' decision -5 JUSTICE STEVENS: You said there was a 6 permission. 7 MR. WAXMAN: As -- as a background rule, 8 that's what they said. What they said was, they -9 first of all -- and we are looking at page 52 -- they 10 acknowledge the force of the argument, quote, "that the 11 bulk of international shippers would never intend to 12 have their disputes decided in a class arbitration." 13 But they said, well, we can deal with that later in 14 deciding whether they can opt in or out. 15 I mean, the point is that if you have to opt 16 in because it's clear that you never agreed, there is no 17 meeting of the minds. 18 Secondly -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, may I 20 ask you -- because your time is running and we are 21 spending all of your time on this preliminary question. 22 There is one fundamental flaw, it seems to 23 me, in your argument, and I'd like you to answer it. 24 And you can call it "the vanishing class action." 25 AnimalFeeds wanted to be in court, not in arbitration.
24 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said -- and they 3 wanted to bring a class action. You persuaded the 4 Second Circuit they belong in arbitration. So now they 5 are in arbitration. You say: The only thing we 6 consented to is a one-on-one claim. Fine. 7 AnimalFeeds can then say: Fine, well, we 8 didn't consent to anything more than the one-on-one. We 9 had a class action. We had -- we were in court. We 10 could have proceeded in an individual action or a class 11 action. Now we are in arbitration, and under the 12 agreement, as you read it, we can't have the class 13 action in arbitration. 14 That doesn't mean it vanishes, because if it 15 does, then the arbitration clause is not merely saying 16 what the arbitrator can decide, but it is shrinking 17 drastically the dimensions of AnimalFeeds' claim. 18 MR. WAXMAN: That is incorrect, with 19 respect. AnimalFeeds doesn't have a class claim. 20 AnimalFeeds has a claim. Its claim is that it paid too 21 much for the contracts that it entered into -- the charter 22 parties -- to ship some sort of oil from Panama to ports 23 around the world. 24 It is -- it was asking a court, and is now 25 asking an arbitrator, to join in the separate claims

1 that other parties to other contracts with other 2 terms -3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's what it was 4 doing in court. 5 MR. WAXMAN: Exactly. And -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and the court 7 said this goes to arbitration. What is the "this"? 8 If it's only a one-on-one claim, how do they lose the 9 larger claim that they had in court? 10 MR. WAXMAN: It's -- you know, that argument 11 -- in the JLM case, which is the case in which the 12 Second Circuit, the district court in the Second Circuit 13 said, no, you have to arbitrate this -- their briefs 14 actually made this point. Their briefs said you can't 15 send us to arbitration, because we won't get class 16 treatment in arbitration. 17 And the Second -- the district court in the 18 Second Circuit said you have got to arbitrate 19 according to the terms of your agreement. In footnote 9 20 of the Second Circuit's opinion ­21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they never -- they 22 never gave up. 23 MR. WAXMAN: They never -24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- if the -- if you 25 would regard arbitration as a change in forum, like
26 Alderson Reporting Company

1 a forum selection clause, it says where you go, but it 2 doesn't change, if you have to go to another forum, what 3 your claim is. 4 MR. WAXMAN: Their claim was we paid too 5 much. And with respect, Justice Ginsburg, your point 6 that they aren't allowed to proceed in class arbitration 7 is no different than the fact that by agreeing to 8 arbitrate this bilateral dispute, the parties agreed to 9 dispense with an appeal and with meaningful judicial 10 review of the things the arbitrators decided. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, I hope you are 12 going to have time to go through (a), (b), and (c) -13 MR. WAXMAN: I -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- as you started to do. 15 MR. WAXMAN: I will. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you. 17 MR.

27 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 arbitrators correctly said no. 2 I want to skip (b), because my submission is 3 that (b) is what they did. 4 (C) says the clause would be unconscionable 5 and unenforceable if it forbade class arbitration. The 6 panel said: We aren't reaching that; we are not 7 deciding that question. 8 So what's left? The only other argument 9 that AnimalFeeds made was (b): The clause should be 10 construed to permit class arbitration as a matter of 11 public policy. And that is exactly what the arbitrators 12 did. 13 What they said was -- and this is on page 51 14 of the petition appendix -- they said that if they 15 followed a strict contractual theory, quote, "There 16 would appear to be no basis for a class action, absent 17 express agreement among all parties and putative class 18 members." 19 And they then, lower down on the page, then 20 said that we were required to prove that the parties, 21 quote, "intended to preclude arbitration." That is, 22 they applied a background rule that they thought was 23 desirable from a public policy sense. 24 And our sole submission here, the only 25 question presented in this case, is that that decision
28 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 is not -- is precluded by the Federal Arbitration Act, 2 which requires that contracts to arbitrate be construed 3 only in accordance with their terms and what the parties 4 agreed with. And section 4 of the Arbitration Act 5 couldn't be clearer that they -- they can only proceed, 6 quote, "in accordance with the terms of their 7 agreement." 8 May I reserve the balance of my time? 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you. 10 Ms. Pillard. 11 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CORNELIA T.L. PILLARD 12 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 13 MS. PILLARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 14 and may it please the Court: 15 What the arbitrators did here was interpret 16 the contract as the parties asked them to. They did not 17 impose their own policy judgment. And any judicial 18 review is under very deferential FAA standards under 19 section 10, which is confined to correcting what amount 20 to gross defects in the process. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where -- where do 22 they say that they were interpreting the intent of the 23 parties, that it was the intent of the parties to permit 24 class arbitration? 25 MS. PILLARD: Okay. Petitioners' position
29 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 rests on a misinterpretation of what the arbitrators 2 did. And if you look at page 59 of the petition 3 appendix, Mr. Waxman already read to you the language 4 that the arbitrators understood they must look to the 5 language of the parties' agreement to ascertain the 6 parties' intention. 7 And then the next key part is on page 50a, 8 which is a little terse, but let's say -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, what part -- 50? 10 MS. PILLARD: 50a, the next page of the 11 petition appendix. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said 59a to 13 start. 14 MS. PILLARD: No. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: You said 49a. 16 MS. PILLARD: 49a was where -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 18 MS. PILLARD: -- the arbitrators described 19 their methodology, which is standard contract 20 methodology: To look to the parties' agreement, to 21 ascertain the parties' intention, whether they intended 22 to permit -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or to preclude. 24 MS. PILLARD: -- or preclude -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
30 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MS. PILLARD: -- class action. So they have 2 set up -3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that a 4 critical difference, though? I mean, I understood the 5 fundamental question in -- before getting arbitration 6 is whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate this 7 dispute with this party. 8 And it's one thing to say that the contract 9 permitted this sort of arbitration; it's another thing 10 to say it didn't preclude it. 11 MS. PILLARD: That's right. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if it didn't 13 preclude, the contract may not preclude -- if I agree -14 I guess it's the -- well, if I agree to arbitrate with 15 A, it doesn't preclude me from arbitrating with B, but 16 nothing in the agreement compels me to do that. 17 So which did the arbitrators do? Did they 18 say, under this contract, you agreed to a class action 19 treatment, in the sense that -- whether it's the 20 language or the intent or whatever -- or did they say we 21 don't find anything here that precludes class action 22 treatment? 23 MS. PILLARD: Mr. Chief Justice, they did 24 the former. And let me point you to -- on page 50, what 25 they relied on was the broad language of the agreement,
31 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the language "any disputes." And in particular, they 2 drew on the breadth of that language and on the fact 3 that many other arbitrators had read similar language to 4 permit class arbitration. And so those other -5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would you show 6 me this -- I see they have quoted from -7 MS. PILLARD: Yes. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- from the agreement. 9 Where is that in the agreement itself? 10 MS. PILLARD: The "any disputes" -11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 12 MS. PILLARD: -- language? In the agreement 13 itself? 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you know offhand. 15 MS. PILLARD: Is -- the agreement is 16 reproduced in Appendix F of the petition appendix, which 17 starts on page 67a, and the arbitration clause is on 18 page 69a. 19 Now, it's clear that the arbitrators 20 rejected the notion that they should permit -21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, this is -- I'm 22 sorry. This is what I was wondering. It is, of course, 23 any dispute arising from -- blah, blah -- performance, 24 termination of this charter party shall be settled in 25 New York.
32 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Now, there's -- the class is not a party to 2 this charter party. So disputes arising from this 3 charter party doesn't involve the class. So they did 4 not agree to arbitrate with the class. 5 Now, as I understand what the arbitrators 6 did, they said, well, they didn't preclude it, and so 7 we get to decide how far our authority goes. 8 MS. PILLARD: I'd like to address that 9 directly, Mr. Chief Justice. The arbitrators 10 specifically rejected the notion that they should adopt 11 as -- as a default rule. And that's on page 49a. Where 12 we had actually argued that they should, they rejected 13 our argument. 14 Claimants argue that Bazzle requires clear 15 language that forbids class arbitration in order to bar 16 it; the panel, however, agrees with Respondent. 17 So they are saying: We are not going to do 18 this based on a default rule; we are going to do this 19 based on the language and intent. Right? 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, now -- now -21 I'm sorry. I'm just reading along here. They rejected 22 your argument about "forbids," but the -- they go on to 23 say: The issue -- we look at this, we look at that to 24 see whether they intended to permit or to preclude class 25 action.
33 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MS. PILLARD: Right. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's enough for 3 them if the parties did not intend to preclude class 4 action. 5 MS. PILLARD: I -- I respectfully disagree. 6 They go on and they read any disputes to authorize -7 now, it's not to require class action. I think it's 8 important that that be clear. 9 It's to put the class action mechanism -10 or, to read the contract, that the class action 11 mechanism is in the arbitrators' toolbox. It's 12 something that's available. It's not necessarily going 13 to happen, but it's something that's available. So it's 14 part of a delegation to the arbitrators of authority 15 to choose procedures. Now -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In -- in any -- in 17 any case -- when you say "arbitrators' toolbox," I'm 18 trying to figure out if that is something different than 19 what the parties agreed to. 20 MS. PILLARD: No, by agreeing to arbitrate 21 any disputes, the arbitrators found that they were given 22 the authority to use class arbitration, among other 23 procedures, if they were appropriate in the particular 24 case. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it seems to me
34 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that the arbitrators are putting the choice in a false 2 manner. It isn't whether, on the one hand, they agreed 3 to permit it or, on the other hand, they agreed to 4 prohibit it. Just forget about the latter. They must 5 have agreed to permit it. 6 Where did the arbitrators say they agreed -7 they agreed to permit it? Not simply, they did not 8 agree to prohibit it. You don't have to agree to 9 prohibit everything in a contract. You have to agree to 10 permit it. That's what contracting is about. 11 MS. PILLARD: That's right. I'd like to 12 point to two aspects of the opinion that I think clarify 13 this. 14 The one is their reference to the language 15 on page 50a, the panel is -- and they are talking about 16 the language in the context of the other arbitration 17 precedent, or the other arbitration opinions that had 18 developed at that point under the AAA arbitration 19 scheme. And they are saying the -- they find that the 20 broad wording "any dispute" to be significant, and the 21 fact that other arbitrators looking at that language 22 also found "any dispute" to encompass the choice of this 23 procedure. 24 Now, I think it was Justice Alito -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no, I mean, they --
35 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 they put it just -- just the way that -- that is not 2 good for you. "The panel is struck by the fact that 3 Respondents have been unable to cite any post-Bazzle 4 panels or arbitrators that construed their clauses as 5 prohibiting a class action." 6 That's not what -- what they have to find. 7 They must find positively that it permits a class 8 action. 9 MS. PILLARD: And it's our contention -- and I 10 think it's clear -- that they found that it was 11 permitted. And when you see that following -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just give me some language 13 that says that. I -- there is nothing in that paragraph 14 that says it. 15 MS. PILLARD: The -- the broad wording, the 16 "any dispute" -- now, they reject the notion -- they 17 expressly have rejected the notion that they are 18 supposed to do it as a matter of default. 19 And then I just want to address this 20 language, which I think could be confusing, at the 21 bottom of 51a, where they say they don't establish that 22 the parties -- this is the last paragraph on 51a: The 23 Respondents' evidence "does not establish that the 24 parties intended to preclude class arbitration." 25 You might read that as supporting the
36 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 argument that you are proffering. However, I believe 2 that the arbitrators meant that, that once they had 3 established under the "any disputes" language that there 4 was affirmative general authorization on the part of the 5 arbitrators to choose any procedures, to have this in 6 their toolbox, then in order to overcome that, you would 7 need to -- and the Petitioners were trying with their 8 maritime experts -- to show an intent to preclude. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the only language you 10 can point to is that -- is that "any dispute" language 11 on 50a? 12 MS. PILLARD: That's right, and I think 13 that's very important. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: You are hanging your whole 15 -- your whole assertion that -- that these arbitrators 16 not only found that the contract did not prohibit it, 17 but found that the contract positively authorized class 18 action, upon that language on 50a? 19 MS. PILLARD: Together with the language on 20 49a where the panel expressly rejects the idea that all 21 you need is the absence of language forbidding it. 22 Right? 23 So they've already -- they've set the issue 24 up exactly as you -- your hypothetical would require 25 them to. They've said: It's not enough to find --

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where -2 MS. PILLARD: It's on 49a, the second 3 sentence under the heading of "Discussion of Parties' 4 Contentions." They say, "Claimants argue that Bazzle 5 requires clear language that forbids class arbitration" 6 -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: "Clear language" is the 8 point of that sentence. "Claimants argue that Bazzle 9 requires clear language that forbids class arbitration. 10 The panel, however, agrees with Respondents that the 11 test is a more general one. Arbitrators must look to 12 the language to ascertain the parties' intention whether 13 they intended to permit or to preclude class action." 14 MS. PILLARD: I would -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: The point of those two 16 sentences is simply that in order for us to find that 17 you didn't preclude it -- and if you didn't preclude it, 18 it's okay -- you don't need clear language. We have to 19 look to everything. 20 MS. PILLARD: I -- I respectfully disagree, 21 Justice Scalia. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's how I read 23 the two sentences. 24 MS. PILLARD: But I think that what's very 25 important here is that judicial review is under a very
38 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 deferential standard, which is confined to correcting -2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's just 3 saying that they're -- they're giving up a lot. This 4 is the basic reason that you require, I thought, fairly 5 clear language that you are agreeing to arbitrate. They 6 are giving up their right to go into court. They have 7 an agreement between A and B that they will arbitrate a 8 dispute, and they say you are giving up your right to go 9 to court with the dispute between A and C. 10 And the "any dispute" language that you're, 11 you know, quite understandably relying on refers to any 12 dispute arising from the -- making performance or 13 termination of "this charter party." "This charter 14 party" says nothing about arbitrating with C. 15 MS. PILLARD: No, but this charter party is 16 the same agreement that the Petitioners have with every 17 absent class member. We wouldn't be here if every -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, but they can 19 agree to arbitrate. They can agree to arbitrate with 20 some and not with others, even if it's the same 21 contract. They may decide that your client is a very 22 reasonable person; they are happy to submit that to 23 arbitration. 24 Or it's a very big and important client, and 25 they don't want to get into court with you. They may

1 decide some other party, for whatever reason, they 2 don't want to get dragged into court with them. Same 3 charter party, different -- different parties -4 MS. PILLARD: But they've -5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and different 6 results. 7 MS. PILLARD: Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. 9 MS. PILLARD: They've already entered into 10 agreement. They've already said they are going to 11 arbitrate with the absent class members, so everybody 12 has the same contract that says "any disputes," 13 and the question is: Do the arbitrators, under that 14 broad language, have the authority? 15 And I would point this Court to the -- this 16 Court's decision in Mastrobuono, which read a clause 17 requiring arbitration of any controversy to empower 18 arbitrators to award punitive damages, and that was 19 despite established New York State law to the contrary. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: That's where I started 21 this. We don't get many contract interpretation cases, 22 and that's why I -- I needed to go back to Jack Dawson, 23 who is a great contracts professor. And I am -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I used to teach contracts. 25 Did you know that?

1 JUSTICE BREYER: What? 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I used to teach contracts. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't have that 4 pleasure, but the -5 (Laughter.) 6 JUSTICE BREYER: The -- but the -- as I recall, 7 the way I would have interpreted -- imagine a worker who 8 says: I have a right, permission -- it's permissible 9 for me to eat lunch next to the machine. The employer 10 says no. The question was what is -- does the contract 11 permit this or not? 12 So the arbitrator or the judge reads the 13 words. Nothing. They have no idea. Then the judge or 14 the arbitrator reads the rest of the contract. Hasn't a 15 clue. Then the arbitrator or the judge goes and looks 16 and sees what's practice around here? "I don't know." 17 Then they might look to what happens in the rest of the 18 industry. Then they might look to what happens in 19 foreign countries with comparable industries. Then they 20 might look to public policy. 21 They might look almost to anything under the 22 sun they think is relevant, and the way, in jargon, you 23 describe the bottom line is: They have found a meeting 24 of the minds as to what this means. 25 Now, of course, it isn't really a meeting of
41 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the minds. But that's just the summary of the 2 conclusion as to what, objectively read, those words in 3 the contract mean. Now, that's how I think I would have 4 learned it. 5 Is that still done, or is there some other 6 way of describing it? 7 MS. PILLARD: I think that's pretty good 8 contract law. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: If that's contract law -10 MS. PILLARD: And that's the way I understand 11 it. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: -- then I take it what 13 they're saying is: It may be true that the arbitrators, 14 when they looked at some of those elements, really got 15 it wrong. Now, if they are correct on that -- this is 16 the other question I have. You are going to say: No, 17 they're not -- they didn't get it that wrong; wrong, 18 maybe, but not that wrong. 19 All right. Now, can they not do this? The 20 next person who has this form contract does not so 21 readily agree it's up to the arbitrator to say whether 22 that contains a class action or not. Rather, they say: 23 I read this contract as reserving that question to the 24 court. It's not the same language as was there in 25 Bazzle; it's not the same industry of the kind you had
42 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 in Bazzle; and, therefore, a judge should decide that. 2 That's the meeting of the minds on the who question. And 3 then we'll get it all resolved, because the judge might 4 come out differently if they're right, and maybe 5 arbitrators will follow the judge. 6 I'm interested, because we might have to write 7 something, in your answer to that question. 8 MS. PILLARD: I think that if they wanted to 9 write around it, they could do that, as this Court -10 JUSTICE BREYER: Not -- we know they're 11 going to -- they have something already in place. 12 MS. PILLARD: Could it be interpreted to 13 say -14 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 15 MS. PILLARD: -- this is a question for the 16 court? 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh. 18 MS. PILLARD: I think -- I don't see the 19 language here in this contract, but they could try to do 20 that. There's nothing in the FAA that bars it. 21 And, you know, as we've emphasized, the 22 contract interpretation, under ordinary contract rules 23 that the FAA has consistently applied in -- and this 24 Court has consistently applied to the FAA in -- in many, 25 many cases -- it's ordinary contract law we're talking
43 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 about here. 2 Now, I just think one thing -- when we are 3 thinking about contract law, which is ordinarily in the 4 province of the States, I think it's important that the 5 New York Appellate Division, in Cheng v. Oxford Health 6 Plans, has since approved just such an arbitrator's 7 contract interpretation under New York law, allowing 8 class arbitration under a 1998 pre-Bazzle clause -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Allowing. 10 MS. PILLARD: -- like this one. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Allowing. See, that's 12 where I get hung up. There's a difference 13 in arbitration -- and it's a fundamental difference -14 between allowing something and a background rule that 15 requires it if you don't say anything about it. 16 The difference I see with the hypothetical 17 Justice Breyer put is that you are talking about the 18 details of a contract once it's agreed there is a 19 contract. There's a contract that governs the 20 relationship between the employer and the employee, and 21 you're trying to figure out if it says anything about 22 where they eat lunch. 23 This is the much more fundamental issue of 24 whether you've even agreed to arbitrate with this 25 person. Is this guy your employee or just somebody who
44 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 came in off the street? 2 And I think what your brother's position is, 3 is that this is just somebody who came off the street; 4 the class members. I didn't agree to do anything with 5 them. 6 MS. PILLARD: Well, I think, Mr. Chief 7 Justice, that that goes back to whether any disputes can 8 plausibly be read to encompass the class mechanism, 9 because if it can, well, then, by agreeing to that 10 contract, you have, in effect, agreed to something that 11 delegates to the arbitrator the ability to use that. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -13 MS. PILLARD: So when you picked -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I -15 MS. PILLARD: -- your arbitrator you picked 16 your arbitrator knowing that. And here, they had 17 extra notice, right, because this case had been filed 18 in court as a class action? They knew when they picked 19 these arbitrators -- and you can tell by the caliber of 20 arbitrators they picked -- that they knew this could be a 21 class arbitration, and so they are picking people who 22 are up to that task. 23 Now, they also know that they are going to 24 dispute that, but if we're right that the arbitrators, 25 plausibly and under the -- the Marrs standard of
45 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 judicial review, have -- have sustainably interpreted 2 this contract to give the arbitrators the authority to 3 proceed on a class basis, well, then, I think your 4 objection -5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's -6 that's what it comes down -7 MS. PILLARD: -- Mr. Chief Justice, 8 disappears. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what it comes 10 down to -11 MS. PILLARD: Right. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- whether it's an 13 interpretation of the contract to give the arbitrators 14 the authority to proceed on a class basis. 15 Not enough, right, under your view, if 16 there's nothing in there that precludes them from doing 17 so? 18 MS. PILLARD: I think that's a question of 19 State law. For example, under the State law at the time 20 in South Carolina, what the South Carolina Supreme Court 21 found in Bazzle was that the contract was silent, but 22 the -- applying two rules of contract construction, 23 contra proferentem -- well, one rule of contract 24 construction and one FAA rule, which is the Moses H. 25 Cone rule, the court said: We find this contract
46 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 authorizes it. Right? So there was contra proferentem. 2 There was also, which I haven't mentioned 3 and I should, the Moses H. Cone rule, which says when 4 there's any ambiguity about the scope of issues that 5 have been given to the arbitrator, we put a finger on 6 the scale in favor of giving the issue to the 7 arbitrator. So if it's unclear, any disputes, well, 8 maybe that only is about contract issues, where the 9 court in JLM said, no, it's antitrust, too -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what -- what 11 happens -12 MS. PILLARD: -- and the arbitrators say 13 procedure, too. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What happens if you 15 get the arbitrator on the stand, and he says: As we read 16 the contract, it doesn't say -- and nothing about the 17 intent of the parties leads me to believe they meant -18 you may arbitrate this on a class basis, but at the 19 same time there is nothing in there that says you may 20 not. And I looked at the intent of the parties 21 and background rules, and nothing there says you may 22 not. 23 What do you understand to be the answer? Can 24 they proceed on a class basis or not? 25 MS. PILLARD: I understand that to be

PILLARD: We, the arbitrators, decide 17 that -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -19 MS. PILLARD: -- not we, the United States 20 Supreme Court.

I said 7 she doesn't agree with it. 8 But, I mean, assuming that's true, what's the 9 answer? Yes or no? Can they go ahead with class action 10 or not? 11 MS. PILLARD: They -- in my view, they 12 haven't answered that -- well, maybe they answered that 13 question under New York law. They have answered the New 14 York contract law question that was put to them. 15 I think they tee it up in a way that 16 Mr. Waxman and I agree is a valid statement of New York 17 contract law, which is on page 49. We look to the 18 parties' intent and the language to ascertain whether 19 they would permit or preclude -20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you help me with 21 one -22 MS.

1 process, we have to say they have done their job, they 2 have found this contract authorizes the arbitrators, if 3 they find that it's necessary, and -- you know, we do 4 have a right -- this argument here, which is that they 5 haven't done anything. They haven't decided whether -6 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a question, a 7 very basic, elementary questions? Where in the record is 8 the specific question to the arbitrators found 9 -- that they were asked to respond to? 10 MS. PILLARD: Well, that's a good question. 11 In the arbitrators' own opinion? 12 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand what the 13 arbitrators said, but is there anything in the record 14 that says we want you to answer this narrow question, 15 and if so, what is it? 16 MS. PILLARD: The -- what I'm looking to, 17 and I'm not sure this is going to be the best cite for 18 you, but in the Petitioners' reply brief, they say, 19 the -- on page 6, "The parties certainly authorized the 20 arbitrators to determine whether the parties intended to 21 permit or prohibit class arbitration." And I do think 22 that's an accurate statement of what the arbitrators -23 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the record does not 24 contain -25 MS. PILLARD: Got it.

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- the specific question 2 that arbitrators were asked to answer. Is that correct? 3 MS. PILLARD: I -4 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because I haven't been 5 able to find it. I understand what they say they were 6 asked to answer, but I thought there would be some 7 document saying we've agreed to this supplemental 8 arbitration agreement, which is going to define what the 9 answer -- what is the question you have to answer. 10 MS. PILLARD: Right. Well, the supplemental 11 agreement does -12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because I don't think, 13 that -- from what I've been able to read, I don't think 14 they were ever asked the question whether the agreement 15 authorizes class action or class procedures. They were 16 only asked to decide whether it either permitted it or 17 precluded it, but is that what the question really was? 18 MS. PILLARD: Now, "permitted" I think they 19 take to understand as "authorize," and the reason -- and 20 this is something that the court, in the context of 21 Sixth Circuit Dub Herring case, says -- they explain why 22 do we use the language "permit"? 23 We use it because they are not saying 24 whether we are actually going to use this power; we are 25 just saying this power is available to you. But I
51 Alderson Reporting Company

1 think, for purposes of whether the contract is giving 2 the authority to the arbitrators, that "permitted" means 3 "authorized." 4 JUSTICE STEVENS: See, as I understand it, 5 in the supplemental agreement, they were asked a 6 question about the meaning of the underlying arbitration 7 agreement. 8 MS. PILLARD: Yes. 9 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I can't find what that 10 specific question was, which seems, to me, answers the 11 whole case, if we could find out what it is. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: There's a supplemental 13 agreement here because I thought -14 MS. PILLARD: Yes. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: -- in reading this, the 16 supplemental agreement submitted the case under Rule 3 17 -18 MS. PILLARD: Yes. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: -- of the AAA, and it's 20 supplement -21 MS. PILLARD: Yes. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: -- rule 3 of the AAA 23 supplementary rules says, an arbitrator shall, quote, 24 "determine, as a threshold matter, in a reasoned, 25 partial, final award, on the construction of the

1 arbitration clause, whether the applicable arbitration 2 clause permits the arbitration to proceed on behalf of 3 or against a class." 4 MS. PILLARD: Thank you. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: So I thought the 6 supplemental agreement said -7 MS. PILLARD: Thank you. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: -- apply Rule 3, and 9 therefore, it was asking the arbitrators to decide the 10 question put in Rule 3. Is that right? 11 MS. PILLARD: I think that's correct, yes. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: So then we could get the 13 question by reading page 7 of the blue brief. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, is that what's on 15 56a of the joint appendix, Construction of the 16 Arbitration Clause? That's what Mr. Waxman referred us 17 to? 18 MS. PILLARD: Yes, that's right -- 56a of the 19 -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: "Upon appointment, the 21 arbitrator shall determine, as a threshold matter." 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: What page? 23 MS. PILLARD: Are you at -- on the buff -24 in the buff joint appendix? 56a? 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 56a.
53 Alderson Reporting Company

1 MS. PILLARD: 56a. Exactly. It's -- I've 2 bracketed it here. It's under heading 3, Construction 3 of the Arbitration Clause. 4 "Upon appointment, the arbitrator shall 5 determine, as a threshold matter, in a reasoned, 6 partial, final award, on the construction of the 7 arbitration clause, whether the applicable arbitration 8 clause permits the arbitration to proceed on behalf of 9 or against a class." 10 So the question put to them is: Is it 11 permissible in that phase? And the question put to them 12 in the next phase is: Do you actually want to use it in 13 the context of this case? 14 I did want to address the language that -15 that Justice -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: May I -- you know, that 17 doesn't help me a lot. What does it mean, if it permits 18 it? I mean, I guess you could say, if there's a 19 background rule, that whether the parties agree to it 20 or not, it's okay. 21 Does "permits it" mean "authorizes it"? Does 22 -- does that mean whether the parties have agreed to it? 23 Is that what "permits" mean there? 24 MS. PILLARD: In my view, it means it 25 authorizes the arbitrators to choose. We are talking
54 Alderson Reporting Company

1 here about a question of arbitration procedure, as this 2 Court correctly characterized it in Bazzle. 3 And, typically, what you have is an 4 arbitration clause that says you arbitrate any 5 disputes and, as this one does, it doesn't incorporate any 6 arbitration provider's rules; and, therefore, what you 7 have is the arbitrators have to select the procedures. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you and I have a -9 MS. PILLARD: So they're not -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. 11 If you and I have a contract -- you're going 12 to sell me a car, and we write up a contract and we 13 enter into it, and it provides for arbitration if we 14 have a dispute. I also buy a car from Mr. Waxman, and I 15 Xerox that contract. It's the exact same contract. 16 We have a dispute, and we go to arbitration. 17 Can Mr. Waxman come in and say, I got the same contract, 18 and I've got the same dispute. Arbitrate with me, too? 19 MS. PILLARD: I would say that if 20 you have -- well, if they've chosen the arbitrator and 21 we have chosen the arbitrator, and it's the same 22 arbitrator and the arbitrator wants to put them 23 together, under this language, I would say the 24 arbitrator does have the authority to do that, yes. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Now, suppose
55 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 I have a contract just with you and -- to arbitrate -2 or I -- I have the same contract with Mr. Waxman, but 3 it has no arbitration clause. 4 And he says, well, the dispute is the same, 5 you are arbitrating that, can I come in, too, and get 6 bound by your decision? 7 MS. PILLARD: I would say no. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would say no. 9 And the reason is? 10 MS. PILLARD: He doesn't have an arbitration 11 agreement with you. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not that I -- he 13 doesn't have any arbitration agreement with me or that 14 it's not the same arbitration agreement? 15 MS. PILLARD: He doesn't have an arbitration 16 agreement that has the same language, that has -- the 17 same or substantially similar language giving the 18 arbitrator the authority to use class procedures. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's say the intent 20 is pertinent when we enter into the contract, okay? And 21 there's good evidence about what you and I meant the 22 contract to mean, and there's not any evidence about 23 what Mr. Waxman and I meant the contract to mean. Say 24 we've got an arbitration clause in both cases. 25 Can we arbitrate -- can I be required to
56 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 arbitrate Mr. Waxman's contract with -- along with the 2 one that you and I have entered into? 3 MS. PILLARD: I think your question is 4 getting to we have evidence of subjective intent here 5 and none there, but the New York law, as is the law in 6 many jurisdictions, is an objective intent standard, so 7 you look to the language as evidence of intent. 8 And on this intent question, I did just want 9 to respond to a question that Justice Alito had asked 10 Mr. Waxman about Mr. Persky saying there has been no 11 agreement that has been reached on this issue, which is 12 in the joint appendix, the buff-colored appendix, on page 13 77a. 14 Now, he clarifies in the next sentence that 15 what he -- what he is speaking to there is there has 16 been no agreement to bar class arbitrations, right? But 17 this is in the context of disputes over whether this 18 maritime expert witness testimony is going to be 19 admitted. And I think it's very clarifying that two 20 pages later, at page 79a of the joint appendix, Mr. 21 Persky expressly makes the argument that we believe the 22 arbitrators adopted, which is that the arbitration 23 clause here contains broad language, and this language 24 should be interpreted to permit class arbitrations. And 25 at the end of the following paragraph he continues:
57 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 "Use of 'any' normally means all and includes class 2 arbitration" except -- "unless expressly excluded." So 3 he is two pages later making ­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: What page -- what page are 5 you quoting from? 6 MS. PILLARD: I'm -- I'm sorry. I'm quoting 7 from the buff-colored joint appendix at page 79a around 8 the middle of the page and then in the following 9 paragraph. 10 So he's clearly making the argument here, 11 and he doesn't make it in the brief that Mr. Waxman 12 cited. 13 And I think the arbitrators correctly 14 rejected the -- the Respondents' framing of that issue 15 and actually went further, as they say in their opinion. 16 They didn't think that those were adequate grounds to 17 rule for the Respondents, for us. They thought they had 18 to find an intent in the contract. And then Mr. Persky 19 does make that argument, which I think is the winning 20 argument, here on page 79a. Now -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I -- may I ask 22 you this question? Let's assume that you prevail in 23 this case. I -- I would assume that the tankers are now 24 going to add to their contract, as many contracts do, a 25 provision saying no class action -- you cannot proceed in
58 Alderson Reporting Company

1 a class action. If the arbitration agreement says 2 agreed to arbitrate any and all disputes, but you may 3 not proceed on behalf of a class, would that preclude 4 you from bringing a class action any place? 5 MS. PILLARD: I think it would if -- and if 6 the -- that might be the exact kind of fact situation 7 that if the arbitrators somehow ignored that in reading 8 the contract and said, oh, you -- we still have the 9 authority to authorize a class, that is the kind of 10 thing that under this very deferential standard of 11 review might be exceeding their powers. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are many, many 13 contracts -- and pick up your average credit card 14 agreement -- that will say you may not bring this as a 15 class. 16 MS. PILLARD: Many such contracts, and 17 indeed there are contracts that started doing that back 18 in the '90s. I think the case before -- Discover Bank 19 is a party that started to put express no-class-action 20 terms. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you won't get -22 you win this case, but then all the future AnimalFeeds 23 lose because they'll just put in the arbitration 24 agreement you can't proceed on class. 25 MS. PILLARD: That's right. But at least it
59 Alderson Reporting Company

1 was incumbent on them to do that here if this was 2 something that they were so concerned about would be 3 such a burden on them. And the fact that they did not 4 do that, even though class arbitration has been 5 something that has been happening actively in California 6 for at least a quarter century -- this is one of the 7 largest, you know -- with an economy -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not in this industry, 9 however. 10 MS. PILLARD: I'm not so sure. I mean, we 11 don't have evidence that -- that it has been going on, 12 no, because this is a -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 14 MS. PILLARD: Thank you. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 16 Mr. Waxman, why don't you take 2 minutes? 17 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 18 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 19 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. Three points, so I will 20 take 25 seconds for each point. 21 First of all, these contracts in the class 22 are not all the same. These are form contracts that are 23 drafted by the charterers and their brokers, and they 24 involve different clauses, including different 25 arbitration clauses.

1 The second point, the Rule 3, I think, 2 fairly does encapsulate the question that the parties 3 presented to the Court, which is to construe the 4 contract, the question that the Bazzle plurality sent 5 back. The AAA amicus brief in this case, which I 6 commend to the Court, on behalf of no party says over and 7 over and over again, we drafted the rules to provide 8 procedures to answer the Bazzle contract question. We 9 have no opinion about the answer to the Federal 10 statutory question that arises if the answer to the 11 -- the meeting-of-the-minds question is no meeting of the 12 minds as a matter of contract law. 13 And if you find -- and much of the 14 discussion this morning has focused on this -- that, 15 well, somehow the arbitrators did just decide the 16 meeting-of-the-minds question, they didn't decide the 17 legal consequences of no meeting of the minds, then just 18 as in Keating and as in Bazzle, you will not be able to 19 reach the very important, fundamental FAA statutory 20 question in this case. And the next generation of 21 lawyers will come before you or your successors to get 22 it answered. 23 Now, as to the contract question, I do want 24 to address your point, Justice Breyer, about the 25 toolbox. It is true that in answering the contract --

1 what is -- what did the parties intend? Was there 2 really a meeting of the minds here? And, by the way, 3 let me just say that when Ms. Pillard says, well, we 4 don't know whether the parties in this industry agreed 5 or disagreed, all of the -- the evidence was undisputed 6 that since the days of Marco Polo the background 7 principle in maritime law has been bilateral, rigorously 8 bilateral. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 10 The case is submitted. 11 (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the 12 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
