1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (1:00 p.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument next in Vaden v. Discover Bank. 5 Mr. Ortiz. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. ORTIZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 9 and may it please the Court: 10 This case poses two substantive issues: 11 First, whether section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act 12 impliedly repeals section 1331's "well-pleaded 13 complaint" requirement? Only if it does can a district 14 court look through a petition to compel arbitration that 15 itself contains no Federal question to ground Federal 16 subject matter jurisdiction on a Federal question 17 lurking somewhere in the dispute sought to be 18 arbitrated. 19 And, second, if section 4 does repeal this 20 part of section 1331, can a completely pre-empted 21 State-law counterclaim in a pending State-court lawsuit 22 furnish look-through jurisdiction? 23 Your Honors, at bottom this is ae dispute 24 between two radically different conceptions of Federal 25 question jurisdiction. One view, Respondents', is so
3

1 broad as to allow parties to compel arbitration in 2 Federal court of nearly any dispute concerning credit 3 card debt; and one, Petitioner's, narrowly confined 4 subject matter jurisdiction to those disputes where the 5 arbitration agreement itself arguably arises under 6 Federal law. 7 But, Your Honors, the ordinary, the original 8 meaning of section 4, the structure of the overall 9 Federal Arbitration Act, and the purposes of the Federal 10 Arbitration Act all militate strongly in favor of the 11 Petitioner's view of subject matter jurisdiction here. 12 First, the language. The words "save for such 13 agreement," Your Honors, as the words "save for" 14 themselves suggest, necessarily imply that the agreement 15 exerts some negative effect on otherwise existing 16 jurisdiction. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That simply means 18 that you can't bring an action in Federal court because 19 the agreement says you can't. The agreement says you've 20 got to arbitrate. So if you throw the agreement out 21 save for such agreement, the question is whether or not 22 you could then bring the action in Federal court. 23 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, the -- those words 24 "save for such agreement" were originally intended to 25 refer to the hoary doctrine of ouster, which barred the
4

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Federal courts from subject matter jurisdiction in such 2 suits. The words "but for" suggest that the agreement 3 itself somehow impairs jurisdiction. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ortiz, why isn't 5 section 2 of the Arbitration Act sufficient to take care 6 of the ouster doctrine, whatever may have been left of 7 it? 8 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, section 2 says that 9 an arbitration agreement shall be valid, irrevocable, 10 and enforceable. At the time when section 2 was 11 enacted, the Federal courts were still split between law 12 and equity. Section 2 by itself could well have made 13 such arbitration agreements enforceable, but only in 14 law. Section 4, "save for such agreement," makes clear 15 that there is no -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not sure that I 17 follow that, because it seems to me -- where did this 18 doctrine of ouster come from? It came from the court. 19 The courts said, no, we won't enforce arbitration 20 agreements if it would oust us of jurisdiction. Why 21 would a court reading section 2 not say, well, that rule 22 never made any sense in the first place, so we're not 23 going to follow it? It's not any rule that Congress has 24 imposed on the courts. 25 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, section 2 by itself
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 would not have made clear that in -- such agreements 2 were enforceable in equity. As Justice Story wrote in 3 Tobey v. County of Bristol, bills in equity were thought 4 in the Federal courts to be ill-founded in point of 5 jurisdiction to support a motion to compel arbitration. 6 And so although under section 2 such an agreement might 7 be enforceable in law -- damages might be available, 8 penalty clauses might be enforced in law, a party might 9 also be able to recover the expenses incurred in an 10 arbitration that was revoked before the arbitration came 11 to its conclusion -- that would not be clear that -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That may have been the 13 historic model. This was never a notion that Congress 14 enforced on the courts. They imposed it on themselves. 15 So my question remains why shouldn't the 16 Court then say this agreement has been declared 17 enforceable, the ouster doctrine didn't have much to 18 recommend it in the beginning, but certainly not any 19 more; we can change it? 20 MR. ORTIZ: No, Your Honor. It is true that 21 Congress in the Federal Arbitration Act abrogated the 22 ouster doctrine. The only question is whether section 2 23 would do so by itself or whether section 4 was necessary 24 because of the division between law and equity at the 25 time.

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm just not getting the -2 I have never understood this argument and I still don't 3 understand it now. What is it in the text of section 2 4 that would seem to leave it inadequate to touch equity 5 as well as law? 6 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, section 2 says that 7 arbitration agreements shall be valid, irrevocable and 8 enforceable, but it does not say how they could be 9 enforced. 10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Exactly. And why, 11 therefore, would anyone -- why would anyone be drawing 12 distinctions as to how? It would be enforceable in any 13 way that an agreement might appropriately be enforced in 14 the courts of the United States at the time -- or any 15 courts, for that matter, at the time the act was passed. 16 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, if Congress wanted 17 to be very clear that ouster in all of its forms was no 18 longer any kind of issue in enforcing arbitration 19 agreements, it took the extra step in section 4. 20 JUSTICE SOUTER: It -- it made a categorical 21 statement in section 2. Why did it need to be any 22 clearer than that? 23 MR. ORTIZ: Well, because, Your Honor, it 24 would be the case that arbitration agreements could be 25 enforceable, but just not enforceable in the way that
7

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 might be most helpful. 2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it could be, but why 3 in the world would anyone draw that inference? 4 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, because there were 5 separate bars at law and equity at the time -- at the 6 time of ouster. Under law, there was some room in some 7 jurisdictions for there to be enforcement, not across 8 the board. In equity there was an even higher standard 9 at the time against jurisdiction. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: I have the same problem 11 that Justice Souter does, especially since section 2 12 refers to equity. It says they will be irrevocable and 13 enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or 14 in equity for the revocation of any contract. 15 Obviously this -- this section was meant to 16 apply to equitable actions. You wouldn't dismiss them 17 in law for a -- a ground that only existed in equity? 18 MR. ORTIZ: But that particular section, 19 Justice Scalia, is meant to refer to ordinary State 20 contract doctrines in law and equity, which would make 21 the overall contract unenforceable. The "save for" 22 language is specifically directed at ouster, which is a 23 jurisdictional doctrine rather than one of substantive 24 contract law. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know. When it says
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 they are enforceable and makes an exception only for 2 grounds that enable revocation in law or in equity, I 3 would -- I would think that the general command was 4 meant to apply to both law and equity. 5 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, the Respondents' 6 view also doesn't take into account the other provisions 7 of the Federal Arbitration Act itself. Under their 8 view, the "save for" language is literally read out of 9 section 4 of the agreement, since the rest of section 4 10 would accomplish exactly what they think the 11 look-through doctrine that they are arguing for without 12 those four critical words. 13 Also, sections 203 and sections 205 show 14 that when Congress wanted to expand subject matter 15 jurisdiction, it knew how to do so clearly and 16 unequivocally. And in fact, when Congress adopted 17 Section 205 in 1970 -18 JUSTICE STEVENS: I hate to interrupt you 19 here, but would you explain why the words "save for such 20 agreement" cut back on the jurisdiction? I didn't quite 21 understand your point. 22 MR. ORTIZ: Justice Stevens, the point is 23 that "save for such agreement" instructs a court to jump 24 over the historical ouster doctrine. 25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't it just instruct
9

1 the court to decide whether, if there were no such 2 agreements, would there be Federal jurisdiction in the 3 underlying dispute? 4 MR. ORTIZ: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. 5 JUSTICE STEVENS: So in this case there 6 would be. 7 MR. ORTIZ: No, Your Honor, because the 8 underlying dispute between the parties in this case is 9 a -- concerns the arbitration agreement, not the 10 underlying bank debt. 11 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, it's not the 12 underlying bank debt, but it is an underlying dispute 13 over which this Federal -- if you had brought your class 14 action as an original case, there would have been 15 Federal jurisdiction. 16 MR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor. 17 JUSTICE STEVENS: So then why doesn't the 18 language read on this case? 19 MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, the language 20 in -- the language -- the particular language of section 21 4 is meant to say, save for such agreement but for the 22 doctrine of ouster, setting aside the ouster doctrine 23 whether there would be -24 JUSTICE STEVENS: The text says nothing 25 about the ouster doctrine.

ORTIZ: Well, literally at the time it 5 would have been understood to refer -- to refer to that, 6 because ouster was the whole problem against which FAA 7 itself was first enacted. FAA -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is a tough -9 it's a tough sell. When you say "save for such 10 agreement," which I agree with Justice Stevens seems to 11 me you've put the agreement aside and then you say right 12 away then you look at the agreement to see if there is 13 Federal jurisdiction and only the agreement, not through 14 that. So you're throwing it out and then you bring it 15 right back in. It seems -16 MR. ORTIZ: Not quite, Your Honor. What -17 the rest of that sentence in section 4 instructs the 18 court to look at a suit concerning the subject matter in 19 controversy, which would be a suit seeking specific 20 performance of the arbitration. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of the arbitration 22 agreement? 23 MR. ORTIZ: Yes, sir. So you are -- what 24 the court is instructed to do under the "save for such 25 agreement" clause is to ignore the historical problem of
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 ouster and then to see whether in a suit brought to 2 specifically enforce the arbitration agreement, there 3 would be Federal subject matter jurisdiction. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And I guess 5 it's -- I mean, you say if it said save for the historic 6 doctrine of ouster, then it would be easy to say, and 7 then you look at the arbitration agreement. But it says 8 "save for such agreement" and then you look at the 9 agreement. 10 MR. ORTIZ: Well, you're not quite looking 11 at the agreement. And this makes clear, I believe, that 12 ouster was the problem being referred to in those four 13 words in section 4. It says a suit arising out of a 14 controversy. It's instructing the Federal courts to 15 determine Federal subject matter jurisdiction for a 16 section 4 proceeding, which was completely novel at the 17 time. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You just -- you just used 19 the words "arising out of the controversy." "The 20 controversy" is used in several sections of the 21 Arbitration Act, and "the controversy" in other contexts 22 means the underlying dispute between the parties. "The 23 controversy" is not over the enforcement of the 24 arbitration agreement. 25 MR. ORTIZ: With all respect, Justice
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Ginsburg, it's a little bit more complicated than that. 2 The Federal Arbitration Act uses the word "controversy" 3 four times, twice in section 2, once in section 4 and 4 once in section 5. 5 In section 2, the word "controversy" is 6 embedded in a larger phrase: "Controversy arising out 7 of such contractor transaction." It is that context for 8 the word "controversy" that makes clear that in section 9 2, both instances in section 2, it is referring to the 10 dispute which is sought to be arbitrated. 11 In section 5, by contrast, the simple word 12 which appears the middle of 4A of the Petitioner's 13 brief, either -- section 5, which deals with the 14 appointment of arbitrators or umpires, it says "either 15 party to the controversy", it's clear in the section 5 16 context that the word "controversy" by itself refers to 17 the controversy over arbitration, not to the underlying 18 dispute. 19 JUSTICE ALITO: In Moses H. Cone, didn't the 20 court say that the controversy was the underlying 21 dispute? 22 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, that -- this Court, 23 in that footnote 32 of Moses H. Cone, mentioned language 24 that refers to the underlying dispute. In the context 25 of both the sentence, the footnote itself, and the
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 overall case, it is clear that the Court could not have 2 meant that. 3 That phrase is followed immediately by a 4 semicolon and then the word "hence." And after the word 5 "hence" in that same sentence in the same footnote, this 6 Court says, "Hence an independent basis for jurisdiction 7 needs to exist," which in context makes it clear that 8 it's not referring to look through. 9 Also that sentence cites a Fifth Circuit 10 case, Commercial Metals Company, and the other -- points 11 to the other cases in it. They basically show that an 12 independent -- stand for the proposition that an 13 independent basis of jurisdiction exists, not that there 14 is look through. And, in fact, one of them dealing with 15 Federal-question jurisdiction says that the Federal 16 issue has to appear on the face of the complaint. 17 The rest of footnote 32, Your Honor, is all 18 directed towards -- towards the jurisdictional inertness 19 of the FAA overall. And the case of Moses H. Cone, 20 itself, if look through had been rigorously adopted 21 there, it would have defeated subject-matter 22 jurisdiction because there would not have been complete 23 diversity among the parties. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you do think -25 you do think we should look through to determine
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 diversity and the amount in question? In other words,

2 not in the Federal-question context, but if it's

3 diversity, you say we do look through the arbitration

4 agreement.

5 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, that seems a

6 somewhat different sense of look through; but, to the

7 extent that ordinary, background 1331 or 1332 principles

8 authorize such look through, that is appropriate in

9 arbitration cases as much as it is appropriate outside

10 of arbitration cases.

11 It is Petitioner's contention that section 4

12 has no independent look-through force. To the extent

13 that look through is appropriate, it is because it is

14 appropriate under section 1332, itself.

If under

15 Respondents' view section 4 operates independently to

16 authorize look through, then it would presumably

17 override 1332's normal principle that you do not look

18 through in determining complete diversity. And it would

19 have the overall effect of paradoxically reducing the

20 number of petitions to compel on the diversity side that

21 could be brought in Federal court.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Say that again. I didn't

23 follow that.

24 MR. ORTIZ: The -- the point is a simple

25 one, but it's sometimes hard to express. If you -- if

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 this Court says that section 4 operates independently to 2 authorize look through in section 1331 and section 1332, 3 the courts, district courts, will be in the position of 4 looking through section 1332 petitions to determine 5 whether the parties are completely diverse. 6 It will not be basing the complete diversity 7 determination on the parties before it in the 8 arbitration -- in the petition to compel, itself, but it 9 will be looking through to the underlying dispute. 10 Now, in Moses H. Cone, if the Court had done 11 that, it would have picked up the architect who was 12 dropped from the actual -- between the actual underlying 13 lawsuit and the petition to compel arbitration, and 14 completeness of diversity would have been defeated 15 there. 16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that point argued in 17 Moses -- Moses Cone? Was that point argued in that 18 case? 19 MR. ORTIZ: I do -- I do not know, Your 20 Honor. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why wouldn't 1332 22 require complete diversity and require the court to 23 assure itself of that anyway? 24 MR. ORTIZ: No, Your Honor. The question -25 1332 does not authorize look through for purposes of
16

1 determining completeness of diversity, so if section 4 2 independently authorizes -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said it did 4 have a look through, an automatic look through, itself. 5 MR. ORTIZ: Not under the completeness of 6 diversity, Your Honor. To the extent it has anything 7 equivalent to look through, it's on the amount-in8 controversy side of Section 1332. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. I see. You are -10 you are -- you are limiting it to the amount. 11 MR. ORTIZ: Yes. So, under Respondents' 12 view, there would be -- section 4 would authorize a look 13 through one part of section 1332 and not with respect to 14 another part of section 1332 under -15 JUSTICE STEVENS: I am not -- I mean just -16 I have to be sure I follow. Why couldn't it require the 17 same look through in a diversity case as it does in a 18 Federal-question case? 19 MR. ORTIZ: Because, Your Honor, if this 20 Court authorizes look through in Federal-question cases 21 through the arbitration agreement, itself, to the 22 underlying dispute, then if that look -- and that look 23 through comes -- authorization comes from Section 4 -24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. 25 MR. ORTIZ: -- then in 1332 cases, this
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Court would be looking through not only for 2 amount-in-controversy purposes -3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Complete diversity. 4 MR. ORTIZ: -- but also for complete 5 diversity. 6 JUSTICE STEVENS: What's wrong with that? 7 MR. ORTIZ: Well, that would have the 8 effect, Your Honor, of not allowing the petitioner to 9 define the contours of the lawsuit and would actually 10 reduce the number of section 1332 petitions that could 11 be brought in Federal court. 12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe it would. So what? 13 MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, if that is -14 that is an implication that is -- is lurking in 15 Respondents' position, and it is also -- in a case like 16 this it is a little bit worrying as to why ordinary 17 section 1332 principles should not apply. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: There is a dispute between 19 people. You look at their underlying dispute, the 20 underlying one, and you say: Is there diversity? 21 What's the problem? 22 MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, that's not 23 actually the way you use Federal -- lower Federal court 24 now. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Why -- why wouldn't you do
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 just what I said, just what we started with? You take 2 out the arbitration agreement, and then you look to see 3 what this dispute is about. And if it's about something 4 that happens to involve all people from one side in one 5 State and from another State on the other side, there is 6 jurisdiction. Why is that a problem? I don't 7 understand. 8 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, it -- it removes the 9 Petitioner's ability or the plaintiff's ability or the 10 -- similar to the plaintiff's ability in an ordinary 11 lawsuit to define -12 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? 13 MR. ORTIZ: -- the parties. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? 15 MR. ORTIZ: Well, because, Your Honor, 16 someone could not bring a section 4 petition in Federal 17 court against maybe one party seeking to force that 18 party into arbitration if there are other parties 19 involved in the underlying dispute where there is no 20 diversity. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So you define 22 "look through" as -- under our hypothetical here as 23 looking through to all people who might potentially be 24 parties under this arbitration agreement. 25 MR. ORTIZ: Well, that would be the
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 implication of taking the kind of look-through theory 2 that Respondents are arguing for in this case and 3 applying it evenhandedly. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I will think about that. 5 I'm -- I'm -- I wasn't -- it wasn't clear to me that 6 that was so. 7 MR. ORTIZ: But, Your Honor, there are also 8 several jurisdictional gaps in the act that are created 9 under Respondents' view. The critical -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I hold up just a 11 second to make sure I understand it. You are saying 12 that, let's say, Person A has an arbitration agreement 13 that implicates Persons B and C. C is diverse, but B is 14 not. They could decide to compel arbitration with 15 respect to B and leave C out of it. But if you follow 16 the look-through doctrine, you would say, well, the 17 dispute is between A and B and C; and so you would be 18 depriving A of their right to frame their own complaint 19 in a way that doesn't create Federal jurisdiction. 20 MR. ORTIZ: Exactly, Your Honor, and that -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's not quite so, 22 because the -- the action could proceed with just A and 23 C, and then it -- it could come to a complete judgment 24 as to them. In the look through for the -- the claims 25 that are involved, the action couldn't possibly proceed
20

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 without taking account of the pre-emption claim that the 2 Federal -- the Federal claim. 3 You couldn't -- you could decide the case 4 completely in No. 1, the diversity case, but not in No. 5 2. So there -- so there is a difference. It's true, 6 you don't decide it completely as to all parties. 7 MR. ORTIZ: When the -- no, Your Honor. 8 But there -- there could under your situation be large 9 parts of the underlying dispute that are not covered 10 under -- and still left to be decided. It is, you know, 11 not the case that necessarily everything would be 12 subject to arbitration. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, I suppose 14 how that works depends on what the rules are about how 15 you frame the dispute once you do look through. 16 I mean, if there is a pending State suit 17 between A and B, even though C may -- you could have 18 sued C as well, I mean the judge can say, well, I am 19 only going to look through to what the -- the actual 20 litigation is; and if I look at that, that's not a 21 Federal case. And -- and -- and so your position 22 follows. 23 MR. ORTIZ: This Court could; and, 24 interestingly, that wasn't the situation in Moses H. 25 Cone, itself. There, there was a preexisting lawsuit,
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and this Court did not look through. The court found 2 that there was no problem with the architect being 3 absent from the petition to compel arbitration, itself. 4 Well, Your Honors, there is also, as I 5 mentioned, strange jurisdictional gaps that are created 6 under Respondents' view of this case. Section 4 is the 7 only section of the arbitration -- in the Federal 8 Arbitration Act that has the critical "save for such" 9 language, which under Respondents' view authorizes 10 look-through jurisdiction, in particular, Sections 7, 9, 11 10, and 11, which allow a court, a Federal court, to 12 compel the attendance of witnesses at ab arbitration. 13 That is Section 7; and then 9, 10, and 11, which 14 respectively allow a Federal court to confirm, vacate, 15 or modify an arbitration once it has happened. 16 None of those sections contain language 17 which under Respondents' view or the Fourth Circuit's 18 view are necessary for there to be look through. 19 In all those cases -- situations, Your 20 Honor, the Federal courts would be in the position of 21 being able to compel arbitration under section 4 but not 22 being able to compel the attendance of witnesses at the 23 arbitration or to subsequently confirm, vacate, or 24 modify an award coming from an arbitration that they, 25 themselves, compelled.

1 Coming from an arbitration that they 2 themselves compelled. The closest Respondent comes to 3 sort of explaining this or trying to jump or leap over 4 this gap, are two amici, two law professors, who argue 5 that this Court should find jurisdiction, subject matter 6 jurisdiction under sections 7, 9, 10 and 11 as an 7 emanation from sections 3 and 4, only one of which 8 actually has the necessary "save for" language. 9 Also, Your Honors, this look-through 10 approach to Federal subject matter jurisdiction violates 11 the core purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act. The 12 Federal Arbitration Act was meant to get things to 13 arbitration quickly and to have arbitrators, not judges, 14 decide them. These -- sometimes often complex 15 jurisdictional inquiries undermine both those aims. 16 Here this case has been pending in Federal 17 court just at the jurisdictional stage for many years 18 now. In the Strong case which is now en banc before the 19 Fifth Circuit -- I'm sorry, the Eleventh Circuit -20 Justice -- Judge -- excuse me, Judge Marcus wrote a 21 32-page opinion. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, and what really 23 leapt off the page at me in that opinion, he gets to the 24 end, I think he basically presents your position and 25 then he says: Thus, on my reading the relevant portion

ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, he didn't say 6 it had to be rewritten. He said if you wanted to make 7 it even clearer what was originally intended under 8 section 4 that is how you would do it. That's a far cry 9 from saying that you need to do violence to the statute. 10 Here -11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, his rewriting 12 doesn't look very much like section 4 to me. 13 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, if his rewriting, 14 given the disappearance of the ouster doctrine -- he's 15 trying to make it clear to present context what was 16 originally understood at the time the Congress 17 originally enacted the FAA. There is no memory, 18 historical memory or otherwise, of the ouster doctrine, 19 no realization how it actually played out; and against 20 that absence of knowledge, Judge Marcus is trying to 21 educate his readers and the lower courts as to how 22 things need to be done. 23 But certainly the language as originally 24 understood would have -- that save-for language would 25 have been all about, which it is clear from the time was

1 thought by Congress to be the major obstacle to 2 arbitration. 3 JUSTICE ALITO: What about the fact that 4 that was not included in the New Jersey statute, nor was 5 it included in -- was it included in the Uniform 6 Arbitration Act? 7 MR. ORTIZ: No, Your Honor. Now -8 JUSTICE ALITO: What's the explanation for 9 that? 10 MR. ORTIZ: The explanation, Your Honor, is 11 that in New York law and equity have been merged. 12 JUSTICE ALITO: I know. And you're saying 13 New Jersey; it was, you know, a very complicated 14 argument about the status of it. What about the Uniform 15 Arbitration Act? 16 MR. ORTIZ: By the later times it appeared 17 that it was closer, coming -- the law and equity across 18 many jurisdictions was coming closer, but at the time in 19 the Federal court system at least, if only because of 20 Justice Story's hostility towards jurisdiction, finding 21 jurisdiction in the Tobey case to build equity seeking 22 specific performance kinds of things, that language is 23 necessarily clear. 24 Your Honors, if there are no further 25 questions I would like to reserve my time for rebuttal.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 2 MR. ORTIZ: Thank you. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips. 4 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS 5 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 6 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 7 and may it please the Court: 8 It seems to me that if the argument that 9 just ended doesn't prove anything, it suggests that 10 perhaps the Court ought to follow the simple expedient 11 of read the statute as it's written, apply it as written 12 and come to what strikes me, at least, as a reasonably 13 easy resolution of this particular case. 14 The statute says that a party aggrieved by 15 the alleged failure to arbitrate -- and we have that 16 precisely in this case because the other side has filed 17 a lawsuit against our indemnitee arising out of an 18 underlying dispute -- may petition any United States 19 district court which, save for such an agreement -- it's 20 pretty clear that everybody agrees that in this context 21 you just simply put the agreement aside -- and then you 22 say would have jurisdiction under Title 28 in a civil 23 action of the subject matter of the suit arising out of 24 the controversy between the parties. 25 It seems to me reasonably clear to interpret
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that language as saying you look to the underlying 2 dispute between the parties. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's the question 4 that I have, Mr. Phillips. What is the underlying 5 dispute between the parties? 6 It seems to me that your look-through 7 argument is look-through only halfway. That is, if you 8 look -- if you consider the controversy, the suit that 9 was brought in the State court, the controversy is here 10 we have a customer who hasn't paid the amount charged. 11 So we have a suit on a debt. Why isn't that the 12 controversy? You have to make the counterclaim the 13 controversy, which comes up only defensively. It wasn't 14 brought as a lawsuit. 15 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, the 16 language of section 4 actually talks about the subject 17 matter of a suit arising out of, not the existence of a 18 suit; and section 4 doesn't require that a lawsuit have 19 been filed. So it's not appropriate simply to say to 20 yourself look at what litigation actually exists, 21 because in as many cases as not there is not going to be 22 any litigation ongoing. So the court has to make the 23 hypothetical: would the court have had jurisdiction 24 over the subject matter of this dispute? And the 25 dispute in this case, which Professor Ortiz was very
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 explicit about -- he said specifically that if he had 2 brought this as an affirmative lawsuit it would have 3 arisen under Federal law. 4 It seems to me that's as clear a concession 5 that the nature of this dispute is a question of Federal 6 law. And therefore -7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who gets to frame -8 who gets to frame the complaint? Normally if you're a 9 party and you have a dispute that may implicate Federal 10 law, you have control over the complaint. You don't 11 have to have a -- you don't have to well plead it in a 12 way that implicates a Federal question. You can go out 13 of your way to do it in a way that does not implicate a 14 Federal question; and therefore it would not be, you 15 could not bring it in Federal court. 16 Just as in the diversity example, you can 17 specifically avoid suing people who would create 18 diversity. But in your position the judge has to in his 19 mind write a complaint and see whether there is 20 jurisdiction or not; and how does the judge decide 21 whether to sue diverse parties or not to sue diverse 22 parties? 23 MR. PHILLIPS: I think what the judge has to 24 do is to take -- is to give the plaintiff in the section 25 4 complaint the benefit of his allegations. And we have
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 made an allegation here that the subject matter of this 2 dispute arises under Federal law, and we did that not 3 just based on our own assessment of the situation in the 4 abstract, but we did that on the basis that she had 5 filed a very specific claim against us asserting that we 6 had violated essentially section 20. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but she chose to 8 assert it only defensively; and it's not a complaint -9 the counterclaim if it had been brought as an 10 independent action, everybody agrees qualifies for 11 Federal jurisdiction. But the litigant who has this 12 claim is asserting it only as a defense to a claim that 13 you admit does not qualify for Federal jurisdiction. 14 MR. PHILLIPS: But Justice Ginsburg, I think 15 the difference is that we are not seeking to remove her 16 original lawsuit. That's not -- if that were the case, 17 then I think the argument you're making is a legitimate 18 one. All we are seeking to do is to assert our 19 independent section 4 rights and that's not at all 20 dependent on the -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in the practical 22 effect, what happens? Now you have asserted that you 23 can enforce because of the counterclaim that asserts -24 that arises under Federal law. But you say it's is not 25 the same as removal because the underlying claim, your
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 suit on the debt owed, remains in Federal -- State 2 court; but what happens to that claim once you have this 3 arbitration? 4 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are a couple 5 possibilities. I mean, first of all, the arbitration 6 agreement is quite explicit in saying that if, if you -7 if this starts off as litigation and then a subsequent 8 claim is made by either of the parties, the parties have 9 the right to enforce the arbitration as to that 10 particular claim. So that's specifically what we did in 11 this particular case. 12 So in theory, at least the collection action 13 would remain in State court as a State cause of action, 14 although it would certainly be available to the 15 Petitioner in this case to say, well, no, if you're 16 going to arbitrate that portion of the case then I'm 17 content to arbitrate the rest of the case as well. So 18 they could do it that way or we could arbitrate the 19 Federal law. 20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips -21 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry? 22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Clear up one thing for me. 23 Is it correct, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, that the 24 counterclaim was purely defensive? Didn't it ask for 25 additional relief? The counterclaim, wasn't it a class
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 action? 2 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, right. Yeah -- no -3 exactly. That's absolutely true. 4 JUSTICE STEVENS: So it was not merely an 5 defense to the action, the State court action. 6 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I meant -- I didn't mean 8 to say you couldn't get affirmative relief on a 9 counterclaim. Of course you could. But this -10 MR. PHILLIPS: But I couldn't -- I couldn't 11 remove it -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Chose not to -13 MR. PHILLIPS: I think that was the point 14 she was trying to make. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- chose not to litigate 16 the case, chose to -- well, I'm being sued, so I'm going 17 to bring up this claim. It wasn't as an original 18 matter. 19 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I -- I understand 20 that, Justice Ginsburg, but the -- the -- but the point 21 I am trying to make here is that the language of section 22 4 just talks about the subject matter of the controversy 23 between the parties. It doesn't specifically talk about 24 an existing lawsuit, and frankly it doesn't envision the 25 existence of a specific lawsuit.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The controversy between 2 the parties is the credit card company says, customer, 3 you're in default $10,000; and the customer said, if 4 that's so, then I have certain offsets because they 5 charged me too much interest. How do you -6 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, in that -7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- how do you -- it's all 8 part of the same controversy, isn't it? 9 MR. PHILLIPS: But -- no -- well, I mean you 10 could -- you can certainly view it as part of the same 11 controversy, but the -- but the bottom line is, the 12 question is: Would a Federal court have jurisdiction 13 over the dispute that arises under Federal law between 14 the Petitioner and the Respondents? And the answer is 15 clearly yes. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the dispute? You 17 say the dispute is not defined by what -- what has been 18 brought in a complaint. 19 MR. PHILLIPS: It's defined by our complaint 20 in section 4. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- from your 22 argument, I would gather that a court would be able to 23 imagine a counterclaim. Once it finds out, you know, 24 what -- what -- what the principal complaint is about, 25 the court could imagine that there would be a
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 counterclaim for interest or for something else. 2 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm not sure -- I'm not 3 even sure -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's very strange to decide 5 Federal jurisdiction on the basis of -- of imagined -6 imagined complaints. 7 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I mean the problem 8 with that -- I mean the difficulty arises, Justice 9 Scalia, because the language of the statute does say 10 that the court has to determine whether it would have 11 jurisdiction over the subject matter of the controversy. 12 And then that -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the problem with his -14 I mean with his interpretation, you don't have to 15 imagine anything. 16 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, with his 17 interpretation, you have to imagine everything. In 18 point of fact, you have to imagine that this had 19 something to do with ouster when it doesn't use the word 20 "ouster." 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -22 MR. PHILLIPS: It has to do with equity and 23 law when it uses "equity" and "law" in other contexts. 24 And -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have to imagine
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 complaints. You -- you don't have to invent litigation. 2 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. That's true, but 3 what it -- but -- but the flip side of that is that this 4 is a section, a fundamental provision, of the Federal 5 Arbitration Act that apparently was designed to provide 6 a basis of Federal jurisdiction for the Gila Indian 7 Tribe claims. It seems inconceivable to me that 8 Congress had that narrow an interpretation of section 4 9 in mind when it passed this particular law. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's close to inconceivable 11 to me that Congress wanted us to -- to construct 12 litigation that is not yet in existence. 13 MR. PHILLIPS: But I think all of this 14 really is talking -- I mean this is not significantly 15 different -16 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- answer that the 17 litigation does exist. 18 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but your position is it 20 doesn't have to exist. Had that litigation not been 21 brought, had the motion to arbitrate been brought before 22 a lawsuit was filed, that the court would still have to 23 consider what is the dispute between the parties and 24 what kind of complaints could that dispute have 25 generated.
34
Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. PHILLIPS: And it may well be, Justice 2 Scalia, that in that context the answer is that the 3 court will say that the claim is unripe; that we don't 4 know for sure whether or not this is going to congeal 5 into a real dispute between the parties. And if that's 6 the case, obviously, then the court does not have to go 7 forward. But you don't have to worry about that in the 8 context of this particular litigation because that 9 dispute has congealed. The parties are at loggerheads 10 over the particular issue in this case. And -- I'm 11 sorry. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There would be nothing 13 inappropriate about a State court entertaining that 14 excessive interest claim, but applying Federal law to 15 it. I mean the -- 1831(d) says that Federal law governs 16 the interest -17 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not state usury law. So 19 you could have this case going on in State court. 20 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the State court would 22 be perfectly competent to apply the Federal law. 23 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Although, you know, 24 that's to the -- obviously, that sets aside the 25 arbitration agreement completely.

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why does it set 2 aside? This is the thing I guess I don't understand 3 about the case, and that is what is really driving your 4 side, given the difficulties that I share with the 5 Justices on my right and left here. And the -- the 6 tacit assumption seems to be that you in fact are going 7 to get shortchanged on your arbitration right if you 8 have to bring your arbitration claim in a State court. 9 And I don't see that. 10 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, first of all, section 4 11 doesn't apply in -12 JUSTICE SOUTER: I know section 4 doesn't, 13 but section 2 does. 14 MR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, section 2 does, 15 but whether or not -16 JUSTICE SOUTER: You can -- based on the 17 Federal act, you can in State court claim your right to 18 enforce the arbitration agreement. 19 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but the flip side of 20 that is -21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why don't you do it in the 22 State court instead of going through these gymnastics? 23 MR. PHILLIPS: Because we have serious 24 doubts as to whether or not in fact we will have our 25 Federal rights protected as zealously as we would in a

1 Federal court. 2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Speaking of gymnastics, 3 can I ask you if you had foreseen this problem, could 4 you have brought a declaratory judgment action to 5 establish that your Federal claim -6 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- controls this dispute 8 and could you have then said that you wanted this 9 arbitrated? 10 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Kennedy. I 11 believe we could have done both of those. 12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why didn't you do that? 13 Why are we here? 14 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, because we brought the 15 action under section 4, which I think -16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, could you still do 17 that after this case? 18 MR. PHILLIPS: Assuming there's no statute 19 of limitations issue, and I don't know that there would 20 be, but that would available. But it still seems to me 21 that the bottom-line question is: Are you entitled to 22 bring an action under section 4? 23 JUSTICE BREYER: So your theory -- I mean 24 basically I think you concede that the other side has a 25 point in sometimes it will be difficult to say what the
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 dispute is precisely and, therefore, difficult to know 2 if precisely this dispute does or does not -- one that 3 you can get into Federal court on. For example, it 4 hasn't even arisen. You know, there is no lawsuit. And 5 I guess what would happen, what the judge should say is 6 they should say to you you'd like to have this in 7 Federal court, wouldn't you, this dispute? What's it 8 about? 9 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: And once he says what's it 11 about, both sides will say, well, basically it started 12 off -- it's just about collecting some money from 13 in-state parties. So that's not Federal. 14 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: So that, you know, 16 something could happen here. It could happen that they 17 could decide they want to sue in a big class action and 18 get huge amounts of money under usury laws of the State 19 which don't exist, so they have to proceed under an FDIC 20 reg, and then it could be Federal. And the judge might 21 say to you: "What? You're just imagining." And that 22 would be up to the judge. 23 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, and the judge would 24 have the discretion to decide -25 JUSTICE BREYER: It's a kind of a defense.
38

1 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: But you'd say then it might 3 be the case that it wouldn't be so hard to decide. 4 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. There could be a 5 letter that says, look, what you're doing here violates 6 Federal law, and if you don't stop it, we are going to 7 take action against you. And then we have to sit there 8 and wait. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: A real suit. And -10 MR. PHILLIPS: But they are here. They are 11 here. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: And in a real suit, there 13 is a class action brought not just on behalf of the one 14 you're trying to sue but on behalf of everybody, where 15 they have to proceed under a Federal reg, and they are 16 going to get a huge amount of money, and you say that's 17 what we want arbitrated. 18 MR. PHILLIPS: And that's precisely what 19 we've asked for here, Justice Breyer. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: So this one is not so hard 21 to figure out. 22 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: There might be some that 24 are. 25 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, and there's no
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 question about that, and it's -2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's hard to 3 figure out, you have, let's say, a franchisee, and you 4 have a dispute with the franchisor. And the franchisee 5 says it's an antitrust violation, and I'm going to sue 6 you under the California antitrust law, and he does. 7 And the Federal court says, we've looked through and 8 says, well, you could have sued under the Federal 9 antitrust law. And you -- yes, I could have; I 10 deliberately didn't. And then they say, well, this is 11 something that could have been brought in Federal court. 12 And that really deprives a plaintiff of his right to 13 frame his complaint as he sees fit. 14 MR. PHILLIPS: And I understand that, 15 Mr. Chief Justice. And in the right case, you know, I'm 16 not sure how I would come out in that particular -17 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, in his case, in the 18 Chief Justice's case, wouldn't you say they don't get 19 into court, probably don't because they are bringing 20 this under a State law? 21 MR. PHILLIPS: You see, I would comply with 22 the original complaint. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. But you just 24 say, is the dispute one that could have been brought in 25 Federal court?
40

1 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, that's exactly 2 what the Eleventh Circuit held. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a violation of 4 the Sherman Act. 5 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, it could 7 be brought in Federal court. 8 MR. PHILLIPS: Well -- and in the right 9 case, the Federal -- you know, if I had to go that far, 10 I might well make that argument, Mr. Chief Justice, but 11 in this case I don't have to go that far. And I think 12 all the Court needs to resolve is in a situation where 13 the parties have a very concrete dispute between them, 14 one that arises exclusively under Federal law, and a 15 party seeks to have that claim arbitrated under section 16 4 pursuant to -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That claim doesn't -18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me get one fact. 19 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry. 20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is the State court suit 21 still pending? 22 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, the State court suit is 23 pending. 24 JUSTICE STEVENS: So there are two separate 25 underlying actions.
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. PHILLIPS: The State court has stayed 2 its hand pending the outcome of the Federal litigation. 3 So we'll see what happens. But, obviously, as I say -4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there could be 5 nothing left for the State court to do after you have 6 the arbitration. I mean, not that you arbitrate about 7 interest due on a nonexistent debt. I mean, you have to 8 have the two things together. 9 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, in some ways, 10 as I say, it seems to me that's Petitioner's right or 11 potentially -- or ours. I suppose either side could ask 12 to have that arbitrated, but the truth is if you took -13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I just can't envision a 14 case where what you haven't effected is taking a case, a 15 debt, simple debt, no diversity a State court case. 16 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you remove the State 18 court from the picture and gotten it over into Federal 19 court to order the arbitration and any follow-up to the 20 arbitration. It just seems to me you have effected -21 accomplished what you could not have accomplished by the 22 -- by removal, which you admit that you can't remove on 23 the basis of a counterclaim. 24 MR. PHILLIPS: But see, Justice Ginsburg, I 25 think that's not right. I think that actually what
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 happens is you eliminate what I perceive to be the 2 Federal question in this through the arbitral process. 3 You still have the underlying collection 4 action. If the Court says, no, there is no violation of 5 the usury laws, you have not overcharged, you have not 6 made any mistakes, the question we still have is a claim 7 on the debt and her obligation to pay it. 8 Now, whether she wants to adjudicate that in 9 State court or resolve it as part of the arbitral 10 process, that's really up to her as far as how that 11 goes. But the arbitration agreement could not be 12 plainer in saying that you can divide up the claims for 13 purposes of seeking arbitration, and that seems to fit 14 perfectly well with an effort to say that there is a 15 specific claim here that arises exclusively under 16 Federal law, and that, therefore, we can enforce our 17 arbitration rights pursuant to that section 4 right. 18 And that's, frankly, all we are trying to 19 accomplish here, Justice Ginsburg. 20 The second part of the statute which is 21 the -- you know, the one that has obviously created the 22 greatest amount of controversy here, is, you know, 23 "would have jurisdiction over the subject matter." 24 Again, it seems to me that this is the easiest case the 25 Court is going to face in this area, because here is one
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 where there is no question -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what worries me. 3 That's what worries me. 4 (Laughter.) 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: If we accept your theory, 6 this is the easiest case, what about the hard cases that 7 are further down the line? 8 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think what's going to 9 happen -- I candidly don't think they are going to come 10 up that much, in part because these issues have been 11 around a long time. You know, it's not like there have 12 been dozens of these kinds of issues arising over time. 13 I don't think it's likely to be that big a problem. 14 But again, it seems to me that district 15 courts have the authority to resolve this, because if 16 they don't believe that there really is a Federal claim 17 that would justify exercise of section 4, they can say 18 that. If they do, then they will -- then they will send 19 it. 20 I mean, look -- the other thing about this 21 is, you know, the other side makes a big fuss about 22 federalism, but we are not asking to take the issues 23 away from the Federal court -- from the State courts to 24 the Federal courts. What we are asking for is what 25 everybody has agreed to here, which is to have these
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 disputes resolved by arbitration. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you could have asked 3 for that in the State court as well, and -4 MR. PHILLIPS: There is no question about 5 that, Justice Ginsburg. The problem is that there is 6 some lack of confidence in the State courts that we will 7 get the same treatment under section 4 that we would get 8 in Federal court. And Congress created that right. 9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then bring that up here on 10 appeal from the State court. 11 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I wish it were that 12 easy to get this Court to grant review of everything 13 that I bring up here in the first place. 14 JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't have any 15 trouble. 16 (Laughter.) 17 MR. PHILLIPS: I appreciate that. 18 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's not really -- of 19 getting constants from Federal judges; the arbitrators 20 can decide this question. 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 22 JUSTICE STEVENS: The arbitrator might 23 decide there is no preemption. 24 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But the -- and that's 25 fine and we have to live with that. And obviously,
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 since we can't change the standards of review on the 2 back end under sections 9, 10 and 11, we are going to be 3 pretty much stuck with that -- with that determination. 4 But the truth is the bigger risk is that the trial 5 judge, the State court will not send it to arbitration. 6 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this, I haven't 7 reread the Moses Cone case, but is your adversary 8 correct in saying that there would have been no 9 jurisdiction in that case it we followed your view? 10 MR. PHILLIPS: No. 11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because the arbitrator was 12 not of diverse citizenship from the other parties? 13 MR. PHILLIPS: I mean, It wasn't litigated. 14 It's not clear on the face of the opinion. So if there 15 is something he knows that I don't know, maybe. But 16 I -- I -- certainly nothing in there that reflects 17 that -- that view of the world. 18 JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- if, in fact, were a 19 nondiverse party in the Moses Cohen, there should have 20 been no jurisdiction? 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, now, the nondiverse 22 party issue, it depends on how you read section 4. You 23 know, section 4 talks about the parties. And the 24 parties there I don't think means parties to the 25 underlying controversy. I think there parties refers
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 specifically to the dispute in front of the court. 2 So I don't think the pass-through problem 3 for 1332 applies in that particular context for complete 4 diversity. 5 I don't think Congress envisioned you would 6 look beyond the immediate dispute under section 4 to see 7 whether there are additional parties, except to the 8 extent, obviously, that you would have necessary and 9 indispensable party litigation that might bring them in. 10 I think the assumption is you take the 11 complaint as it's written, and then you look to see 12 whether or not there is amount of controversy. For that 13 you have to go beyond because the dispute with respect 14 to arbitration is not going to get you anywhere near 15 that number. And you have to look beyond for Federal 16 questions to see whether or not there is a Federal issue 17 there to be enforced. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Is this right? I'm asking 19 if it may sound favorable to you, then I'll get a good 20 response in rebuttal. 21 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm not going to give a good 22 response? 23 JUSTICE BREYER: If you read it the other 24 way -- if you read it the other way, the way the 25 Petitioners want to read it, then is this so or not?
47
Alderson Reporting Company

1 That then you look to see if there is Federal 2 jurisdiction of the arbitration agreement; is that 3 right? 4 MR. PHILLIPS: Under their interpretation? 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, under their 6 interpretation. 7 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: So, what you could have is 9 you could have two parties sign an arbitration agreement 10 that lasts for a year that governs all disputes between 11 them, and one is from Vermont; the other from 12 California. 13 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: So there is jurisdiction. 15 And all the disputes happen to involve just pure matters 16 of -- that never could come into Federal court. I mean 17 there are such matters you could argue about. 18 MR. PHILLIPS: Sure. Right. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: But nevertheless, we have a 20 Federal court issuing this injunction, under their 21 theory. 22 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Assuming the amount 23 of -24 JUSTICE BREYER: Assuming they are right. 25 MR. PHILLIPS: Assuming the amount of

1 controversy -- I mean, it could have an amount -2 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I see. The arbitration 3 agreement has to meet the amount in controversy. 4 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. It has to have an 5 independent basis for Federal jurisdiction. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So then 7 probably no arbitration agreement in itself meets the 8 amount. 9 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's exactly our 10 point. That's why you have to look through. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: So if you didn't look 12 through, then this would apply to nothing? 13 MR. PHILLIPS: Pretty much that's our view 14 of the case. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: If the arbitration -16 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I'm sure my opponent 17 will say something different than that. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: The arbitration agreement 19 has to -- they talk about the arbitration agreement, 20 then you could have really important Federal questions 21 in substantive issues -22 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: -- that couldn't come in 24 because the arbitration agreement doesn't? Or you could 25 have State questions that would suddenly come in because

1 the arbitration agreement does. The arbitration -- but 2 now you're saying, well, that second case is never going 3 to arise. 4 MR. PHILLIPS: Probably not. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Probably not, because no 6 arbitration agreement has -- so then it becomes a 7 nullity of the statute? 8 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Except to overcome the 10 ouster. Okay. We've got your side of it. 11 (Laughter.) 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it makes a nullity of 13 it, except that it gets into the Federal court the 14 decision on the arbitration agreement, which was the 15 object of this stuff, whatever -- whatever the 16 underlying claim is, whether it's a Federal claim or 17 not. 18 As I understood the purpose of the 19 Arbitration Act, it was to make sure that arbitration 20 was -- was honored not just in Federal cases but in 21 State cases as well. And it's entirely compatible with 22 that, that sometimes a Federal court will -- will direct 23 arbitration in a case this involves an underlying 24 controversy that's purely non-Federal. 25 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh absolutely. I mean, you
50

1 know, in a situation -- it depends on how you interpret 2 it. If you interpret it the way that the Petitioner 3 does in saying that you can't have any look through -4 now he softens that and says, well, no, you can have 5 look through for diversity. 6 But if you accept the idea that section 4 7 only makes you look at the dispute at the arbitration 8 level, then the reality is you're going to have no cases 9 that are going to be covered, because you're never going 10 to satisfy the amount in controversy. 11 And then the issue is why do you get to look 12 through for diversity purposes and never get to look 13 through for Federal question purposes? And it -- it 14 seems to me the much easier way to reconcile the 15 language of the statute is to say, of course, you look 16 through to see, particularly if you have an unquestioned 17 Federal question dispute that's being litigated between 18 the parties; we know that; there is not an issue before 19 us. In fact, he has conceded as much even here in court 20 today. 21 And so, it seems to me that's the solution 22 to this case. Now admittedly, there will be other cases 23 where you may have right in these questions, and there 24 will be other cases where the parties will have to fight 25 at the Federal district court level as to precisely
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 what's at issue and what the plaintiff really means to 2 be fighting over. And it may be in some instances you 3 won't get an order that directs arbitration. But that's 4 not this case. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't it proper to 6 look to see -- the party who wants arbitration has a 7 dispute; the dispute is we are owed money by the debtor. 8 Why shouldn't the court say, well, we'll see what your 9 case is about; if your case would qualify for Federal 10 jurisdiction, fine. But we are not going to look to see 11 what the defendants cases is or might be. We'll just 12 look at your case and that's how we will define the 13 controversy. 14 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are two problems 15 with that. First of all, the statute talks about the 16 subject matter of the controversy. It doesn't talk 17 about the specific controversy. 18 And second of all, the statute clearly 19 envisions that there are going to be situations where 20 there is no complaint, there is no underlying State 21 court cause of action, and it still envisions in that 22 situation that a district court is going to have to 23 determine whether or not it would have jurisdiction. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you'll have not 25 only a hypothetical claim, because nothing has been
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 brought, but an hypothetical answer by way of 2 counterclaim to that claim. 3 MR. PHILLIPS: But it seems to me that's 4 precisely what the language "would have jurisdiction 5 over the subject matter of the controversy" asks this 6 Court to make a determination of. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you would come into 8 the court and say there is no suit going on anywhere, 9 but if we were to bring this suit in State court, the 10 defendant could have brought this Federal counterclaim? 11 That's a lot of hypothesis. 12 MR. PHILLIPS: But it seems to me, Justice 13 Ginsburg, the better way to think about this is what if 14 we were getting letters from the Petitioner saying you 15 are engaged in usurious conduct, you're outrageous, you 16 got to stop what you're doing, we are going to bring a 17 class action against you, you had better change your 18 behavior tomorrow, and they don't sue us, and they don't 19 sue us, and they don't sue us? 20 And then the question is are we entitled to 21 go to court to get that resolved and are we entitled to 22 have the resolution to that issue as a matter of 23 arbitration? 24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, the answer 25 to a better hypothetical is what if there had been no
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 original collection action but they had brought such an 2 action. 3 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, that's -4 actually, you're right. 5 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's the case you're 6 really saying. You're saying that is like this case. 7 MR. PHILLIPS: That is this case. 8 JUSTICE STEVENS: And Justice Ginsburg is 9 suggesting it's not, because it happens to arise out of 10 a different -- quite different dispute. 11 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I thought your 12 question absolutely nailed it because you said, would 13 this -- you know, if you brought that suit could you and 14 would you, and the answer is yes, you could, and 15 therefore you know as -- without any question that it's 16 a Federal suit. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Excuse me -18 JUSTICE STEVENS: As I understand your 19 opponent, they would agree there was no jurisdiction 20 even in that case. 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I think that's no 22 doubt that that's their position. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do with the 24 assertion that sections 9 through 11 are not in sync 25 with your view, because they would not give you -- you
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 could go in and -- to compel arbitration but once the 2 arbitration was award -- an award was made, you would 3 not have access to the Federal courts to enforce the 4 award? 5 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean the interesting 6 thing about 9, 10 and 11 is if anything the language is 7 broader than our language. If we didn't have the "save 8 for" and "would have jurisdiction under," this would 9 clearly be an action that arises under Federal law, 10 because the question, you know, section 4 says have you 11 been aggrieved, do you have a right of action, and do 12 you have a remedy for that action? 13 I mean, without this rigamarole that we've 14 been talking about this whole time, we would have -- we 15 would easily have a 1331 action. So if anything you 16 would argue that 9, 10 and 11 arise under Federal law 17 regardless. Now if you don't want to go that far, then 18 it seems to me you just say you read sections 9, 10 and 19 11 and pairing material with the limitation in Section 4 20 and you wouldn't read it any broader than that. 21 But there is no basis for taking the 22 unlimited languages in 9, 10 and 11 and somehow 23 distorting that to more narrowly limit the rights that 24 we have under Section 4. So I -25 JUSTICE ALITO: But the Petitioner says you
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 never clearly clarify the particular Federal on which 2 the jurisdiction rests on this case. What -- can you 3 clarify that? 4 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. This case arises under 5 section 4 through Section 27. 6 JUSTICE ALITO: Section 4 creates the 7 Federal -8 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, it does create it, 9 because section 4, without the "would have jurisdiction" 10 language clearly would be arising under jurisdiction, in 11 my judgment, and the only thing -- and then it places an 12 additional requirement on you. 13 You can't just use the contract that gets 14 you into Federal court. You have to then look to see 15 whether you would have had an underlying cause of action 16 or an underlying Federal claim or whether there would 17 have been diversity jurisdiction on the underlying 18 claim. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why can't you have 20 sort of modified look, through like a modified limited 21 hangout or whatever it was? That is to say, you can 22 look through for the purpose of determining whether the 23 arbitration agreement raises a Federal question. But 24 that doesn't mean you have to look through to determine 25 whether the underlying controversy raises a Federal
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 question. 2 MR. PHILLIPS: Because I think -- I think 3 the reference in the statute to controversy clearly 4 envisions the underlying dispute between the parties, 5 because it's not just the arbitration agreement and it's 6 not even just the controversy; it's the subject matter 7 of the controversy, and you compare that to section 2 8 and it's clear that what the Congress has in mind there 9 is the underlying dispute between the parties. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the Petitioner's -- I'm 11 sorry I didn't get a chance to ask the Petitioner -- is 12 the Petitioner's argument for a limited look through 13 compromised in any way by the Beneficial Bank case which 14 allows removal if there is a Federal defense? 15 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, I don't know if 16 it's compromised by it. I think it -- the Beneficial 17 case makes it absolutely clear that we have here a 18 Federal claim and therefore -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's of course in the 20 context of a defense, as opposed to a counterclaim. 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But again I don't 22 think -- I don't think section 4 is asking the courts to 23 make that determination. I think what section 4 is 24 asking the Court to look at is the subject matter of the 25 controversy, and is it -- is it clear under the
57

1 circumstances that there is in fact a Federal claim 2 underlying it? And here there is no question on that. 3 I ask you to affirm. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 5 Mr. Phillips. Mr. Ortiz, you have three minutes 6 remaining. 7 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. ORTIZ: Thank you, Your Honor. Just a 10 few quick points. 11 I think this Court should be exactly clear 12 how much Federal question jurisdiction the look-through 13 theory would create. So long as a Federal issue can be 14 imagined anywhere in the lawsuit, there would be Federal 15 question jurisdiction under this theory, and this is 16 almost by definition going to be the case in any dispute 17 concerning credit card debt, either because of the 18 theory of complete pre-emption from the FDIA, or because 19 of the theory used in the Strong case before the 20 Eleventh Circuit that RICO's prohibition on the 21 collection of unlawful debt -22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about a Federal 23 defense? 24 JUSTICE STEVENS: That isn't quite true, 25 because here there is a definition in the Federal claim

1 in your counterclaim. 2 MR. ORTIZ: I'm sorry, Your Honor? 3 JUSTICE STEVENS: There is a definition of 4 the controversy in your counterclaim and in their 5 response. 6 MR. ORTIZ: No -- there -- in general, if 7 you accepted their theory, as long as there is an issue 8 that could be spun as a Federal issue which there will 9 always be in a credit card debt collection case and 10 just -- in most States, that on look-through theory 11 would be -12 JUSTICE STEVENS: You're suggesting that 13 every credit card debtor would have a class action? 14 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, every -- it does not 15 have to be a class action to establish what would serve 16 -17 JUSTICE BREYER: That's your view, but I 18 mean believe me, I think I can keep that problem under 19 control. That was your original point. I see the 20 point, it's going to spread too far; you'd have to have 21 some rules that cabin it. 22 Assume I got that under control; maybe I 23 don't.

1 MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, Respondent 2 argues that this is an easy case, or at least over time 3 the courts will decide these things to make the 4 jurisdictional inquiry -- inquiries clear. Petitioner 5 does not believe that is true. 6 For example, here the real party in interest 7 dispute consumed much of the court's time. The lower 8 courts have gone both ways on this issue. It's 9 incredibly fact-dependent. There is no easy answer for 10 it. 11 Also, Your Honor, Petitioner does not 12 believe that the Declaratory Judgment Act would have 13 been appropriate in this case. Declaratory judgments 14 are discretionary and in this context of where you have 15 a pending State court lawsuit Petitioner believes that a 16 Federal district court would be very cautious before 17 permitting one. 18 Also Your Honor, if in the context of 19 declaratory judgment action presumably the district 20 court would have to take the State court admission into 21 account, and in particular here it was admitted that the 22 account was with Discover Financial Services not with 23 the bank. 24 Also, Your Honors, this -- Respondents try 25 to portray Petitioner's position as siphoning off all

1 Federal question jurisdiction. That is not true. Under 2 Petitioner's view, a lot of Federal question 3 jurisdiction -- some would remain. It would just be 4 that the arbitration agreement itself would have to 5 sound in Federal law. ERISA arbitration agreements 6 would still be covered. Some labor agreements would 7 still be covered. There would be -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, what do 9 you mean would still be covered? 10 MR. ORTIZ: Would still be covered under 11 Petitioner's theory of what section 4 means. So for 12 example, Mr. Chief Justice -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which would still be 14 in Federal court. 15 MR. ORTIZ: Would still be in Federal court. 16 Thank you. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 18 The case is submitted. 19 (Whereupon, at 2:01 p.m., the case in the 20 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 21 22 23 24 25
