1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:05 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument next in Case 08-678, Mohawk Industries v. 5 Carpenter. 6 Mr. Allen. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL L. ALLEN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. ALLEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 For well over a century this Court has 12 recognized the importance of the attorney-client 13 privilege. In Hunt v. Blackburn in 1888, the Court 14 clearly states that the seal of secrecy upon 15 communications between client and attorney is founded 16 upon the necessity, in the interest of justice, that the 17 aid and advice of persons having knowledge and skill in 18 the practice of law provide that advice in a manner that 19 is safely and readily available and, importantly, free 20 from the consequences or apprehension of disclosure. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Allen, except for the 22 fact that you and I are lawyers, do you really think 23 that the -- that confidentiality right is any more 24 important to the proper functioning of society than, 25 let's say, the protection of trade secrets? So that in
3

1 a case of discovery where the defendant says, if I 2 produce this I would be giving up a trade secret and 3 it's not necessary for the case, and the judge says no, 4 turn it over -- would there be in your view a right to 5 interlocutory appeal in that case? And if not there, 6 then why here? 7 MR. ALLEN: Justice Scalia, there are -8 there are several answers to the question. Let me 9 start, first, with the -- the issue of the importance of 10 -- of the attorney-client privilege as a key and central 11 element of the administration of justice that this Court 12 has recognized, not just with Hunt, but in a number of 13 cases since. 14 But the question I think also goes more to 15 prong three of Cohen, which is the reviewability 16 standard. In the context of attorney-client privileged 17 information, once that information is disclosed to your 18 adversary, it is disclosed to the last person on earth 19 you might want to see it. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: The same thing with a trade 21 secret. It is a suit between another company who is a 22 competitor of yours -23 MR. ALLEN: Well -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the Judge says, turn 25 over your trade secret, the formula for Cocoa-Cola, and
4

1 you say no. No interlocutory appeal, right? 2 MR. ALLEN: I think with trade secrets -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or do you say there should 4 be an interlocutory appeal there? 5 MR. ALLEN: Your Honor, we do not argue 6 that -- here, that there should be an interlocutory 7 appeal for trade secrets. I think the practical 8 resolution to the trade secret question is present in 9 most cases of commercial litigation, where the court 10 would provide a protective order limiting access to the 11 trade secret; in other words, limiting access to 12 counsel. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what if the court 14 doesn't, as Justice Scalia has posited? The court here 15 could do the same thing, depending on the secret being 16 disclosed. It could set up any number of protective 17 mechanisms. 18 The issue is broader than that, which is: 19 Why is the public policy of anti-disclosure any more 20 important in the attorney-client privilege than in the 21 trade secret context? 22 MR. ALLEN: Yes, Justice Sotomayor. But, 23 with regard to the attorney-client privilege, first on 24 the issue of the protective order, the protective order 25 cannot limit the adversary's counsel from seeing the
5

1 information. 2 As I said earlier, I think that's the last 3 person in the world you would want to see. You could 4 limit access to trade secrets to counsel, who could make 5 no use of the Coca-Cola formula or -- or Colonel 6 Sanders' chicken recipe, but -- but the -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ah. Are you sure? 8 MR. ALLEN: But -- but the answer to the -9 the importance question, I think, has to return to the 10 central and important role that the privilege plays in 11 the administration of justice. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't the role -13 the central role -- role, is to encourage the frank and 14 open communication between client and attorney? That's 15 the purpose of the rule, isn't it? 16 MR. ALLEN: It -- it is the purpose of the 17 rule, at least in part, Your Honor. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. If that is 19 the purpose, the very existence of exceptions infringes 20 that purpose. The minute you create an exception, you 21 are placing some sort of limitation to the frank and 22 open discussion that you are permitting, so the damage 23 is already done. 24 The further disclosure doesn't really serve 25 the purpose -- or help the purpose in any meaningful

1 way. The fact that an erroneous decision on 2 attorney-client disclosure is not going to stop people 3 from talking to lawyers if they really need to and they 4 are staying within the rules. 5 MR. ALLEN: Your Honor, I -- don't think we 6 are here to suggest that it would stop people from 7 talking to their lawyers. I think the point is that the 8 incremental erosion of the rule is going to lessen the 9 value of the privilege. At this -10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well -- but that's what 11 I'm trying to figure out, because you are positing that 12 erroneous decisions on disclosures are being made 13 routinely by the lower courts. 14 Assuming, as I do, that there are some 15 erroneous disclosures, but that that's not necessarily 16 the majority, why is there an incremental erosion 17 significant enough to overcome our interests in the 18 finality rule? 19 MR. ALLEN: Your Honor, I don't think we 20 suggest that -- that erroneous orders on privilege are 21 occurring routinely. Certainly, we have suggested they 22 occurred in this case and that they happened in other 23 cases. 24 But I think the more direct answer to your 25 question goes to the Court's holding in Upjohn. One of
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the things that Upjohn points out is that what is 2 necessary -- and I think the Court makes a similar 3 observation in Swidler & Berlin, that one of the things 4 that's necessary for the privilege to have effect is 5 predictability. 6 If -- if there is no predictability, then 7 you fall back to the apprehension or the worry of 8 disclosure that is observed in Hunt. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Let's talk about 10 predictability. Once you make an exception for waiver, 11 there is already that limitation. It's not absolute. 12 Maybe it can be waived. 13 Secondly, you have to worry about a district 14 court finding it to have been waived, even though it 15 really wasn't. That's another point of doubt. 16 And, thirdly, you have to worry about the 17 Supreme Court affirming a district court that wrongly 18 found it to have been waived because we give, you know, 19 weight to the fact-finding of the -- of the district 20 court. 21 Once you -- once you factor in all of those 22 uncertainties, you are not talking about a -- you know, 23 about a fail-safe privilege at all. There are those 24 doubts, and I'm not sure the doubts are increased 25 enormously, by simply saying a district court may make a
8

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 mistake without -- without your being able to go up to 2 the court of appeals on that mistake. 3 MR. ALLEN: Your Honor, I don't disagree 4 that -- that the rule we search for will not still have 5 problems with the protection of the attorney-client 6 privilege, but I do disagree that it will not 7 significantly improve the quality of the rules that 8 counsel are -- are designed -- or counsel are -- are 9 instructed to follow. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Allen, you used a 11 term before, and I think you were right in using it -12 you said, "interlocutory review," but 13 Cohen v. Beneficial is a narrow exception and it -- the 14 theory is, it is a final judgment. It's not 15 interlocutory. 16 And, nowadays, the courts have 1292(b). 17 They can certify a question, if they think it's 18 sufficiently important and they need an answer, without 19 pretending that it's a final judgment in the case. 20 So, given 1292(b), shouldn't we be 21 particularly reluctant to extend Cohen v. Beneficial to 22 include a case of a privilege that maybe was wrongfully 23 denied? 24 MR. ALLEN: No, Justice Ginsburg. I don't 25 believe that you do. I used the term "interlocutory"
9

1 only to refer to the fact that the appeal would take 2 place while the case-in-chief proceeds. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's what 1292(b) 4 was meant to deal with. 5 MR. ALLEN: I don't think 1292 would -6 would obtain, in this instance, and I think the -- the 7 judge in the district court made this observation 8 himself, although he did not expound on his reasoning. 9 It would appear that the reasoning would be 10 that this -- that a decision in this case is not likely 11 to materially advance the ultimate determination of the 12 litigation, so, therefore, I think 1292(b) would not be 13 applicable in the ordinary case to a -- to a ruling 14 finding waiver of the attorney-client privilege. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Why do you think that 16 your -- that this privilege -- or is it -- more 17 important than any other privilege? I mean, Justice 18 Scalia's question and your answer convinced me that you 19 can protect this the same as you can any other trade 20 secret -- any trade secret. 21 Of course, you do disclose it to the 22 opposing party, but that is also true of any breach of 23 any privilege, so husband-wife, priest-penitent, 24 psychiatrist and patient. I take all of those are 25 privileged. Do we allow collateral appeals there?
10

1 MR. ALLEN: No, Your Honor, you have not. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if we don't allow 3 collateral appeals with the husband and wife, with the 4 priest and -- and someone in -- you know, confession or 5 something, I don't -- with a priest, or with a 6 psychiatrist who is dealing with a patient, why would we 7 allow collateral appeal here? 8 MR. ALLEN: Your Honor, first of all, I 9 don't think the issue of those other privileges has, to 10 the best of my knowledge, come before this Court. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: But then if we grant your 12 collateral appeal, don't we have to, perhaps, equally 13 grant it in every situation, where a judge arguably 14 makes an erroneous ruling on a question of privilege? 15 MR. ALLEN: I don't believe you do, Your 16 Honor, and let me say, first of all, the -- the instance 17 that Your Honor points to, where the information would 18 be disclosed to the other party, it's not the other 19 party in this instance, that -20 JUSTICE BREYER: It's the lawyer. 21 MR. ALLEN: -- that you are worried about in 22 first instance. It is, in fact, the counsel. And -23 and, second of all, I think the importance criteria 24 as -- as previously defined in this Court's cases, is a 25 measure of the importance of the interest that will be
11

1 lost if appeal is not available now. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: So it's -- in your opinion, 3 it's more important to protect the lawyers, who talk to 4 clients, from erroneous rulings, than protect the priest 5 or protect the wife or husband or protect the 6 psychiatrist who is dealing with a patient? 7 Now, that's hard for me to see why. I mean, 8 I think lawyers are very important, but it's a little 9 hard to see why they are more important than these other 10 people. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is the use -12 I'm -- I'm sorry if I cut you off. 13 But what is the use by the adversary lawyer 14 that you are worried about? That the lawyer is going to 15 used information against your client, correct? 16 MR. ALLEN: Correct, Your Honor. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there is a remedy. 18 After final judgment, if the information was disclosed 19 erroneously, the court sets aside the judgment, sends it 20 back, and says, you can't use it in the future and so 21 make your case without it. 22 MR. ALLEN: Your Honor, that -- I apologize. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't that an 24 effective remedy for the harm that you are claiming 25 exists in the disclosure?

1 MR. ALLEN: That is the analysis that the 2 Eleventh Circuit applied, and I think it was incorrect 3 for the following reasons: First of all, it treats the 4 attorney-client privilege as if it is a use privilege, 5 as you describe it in your questioning. It is not a use 6 privilege. It's a right to be free from compelled 7 disclosure. So returning to -- to trial is not going to 8 undisclose the information that's already -9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You have to a right to 10 choose your lawyer and not to be -- and not to be 11 represented by a -- by a different lawyer, and yet we 12 don't permit that to be interlocutorily appealed. 13 MR. ALLEN: That's -14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why is this any greater 15 in terms of the harm that your client suffers? 16 MR. ALLEN: That is correct, Your Honor, but 17 in the attorney-client privilege cases, this Court did 18 not find that collateral order jurisdiction did not 19 obtain because of the fact that the attorney-client 20 privilege or the attorney-client -- excuse me -21 disqualification cases were not important. The Court's 22 ruling was premised upon the fact that that order was 23 sufficiently reviewable under prong three of Cohen. So 24 it's not -- the decisions were not based on Cohen -25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understand what the
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 court below did. I'm just following up on your point 2 about the importance of this privilege and why it's 3 critical that it be subject to interlocutory appeal as 4 opposed to the final judgment ruling. 5 MR. ALLEN: Justice Sotomayor, the -- the 6 importance in this instance is -- is measured against 7 the societal importance or the societal need for 8 non-piecemeal application of the final judgment rule. 9 So when you measure the attorney-client privilege and 10 the role that it plays in the administration of justice 11 in ensuring observance with laws against a rule of 12 efficiency, in this instance in our view, the 13 attorney-client privilege weighs heavier in that 14 consideration. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not -- it's not a 16 rule of efficiency. It's a firm final judgment rule 17 that we have in the Federal system. And we are talking 18 about a narrow exception. The exception was first 19 declared in Cohen v. Beneficial. The question there was 20 security for costs, yes or no? Does that -- that is a 21 pure question of law. It doesn't depend on the variety 22 of factual circumstances. Attorney-client is quite 23 different because it can often be fact-bound. It 24 depends upon this particular case. 25 Cohen v. Beneficial was meant for the kind
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of question that doesn't get you into the facts. 2 Otherwise, once you get into -- once it's a fact-bound 3 question, you are really eroding the final judgment 4 rule. 5 MR. ALLEN: I understand your question, 6 Justice Ginsburg. I think in this instance, the facts 7 that the Court would need to consider are sufficiently 8 narrow that it should not trouble the final judgment 9 rule and sufficiently collateral -10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are carving out 11 an area, attorney-client privilege, as opposed to the 12 kind of situation Cohen v. Beneficial dealt with. 13 Here's a rule that a State has. You have to put up 14 security for costs before you go ahead with a class 15 action. The answer to that is either yes or no, that it 16 either requires it or it doesn't require it. No facts 17 at all. You just have a class action, you need security 18 for costs. 19 Maybe this particular case doesn't involve 20 many facts, but there will be attorney-client privileges 21 cases, waiver cases that surely do. So we can't take 22 that category, attorney-client privilege, and equate it 23 to what was the kind of question at issue in Cohen. 24 MR. ALLEN: I agree, Justice Ginsburg that 25 that was the kind of narrow issue that was at issue
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 in -- in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial. But this Court 2 has considered much more factually intensive cases in 3 the context of qualified immunity or maybe as a better 4 example, the context of the double jeopardy claim such 5 as in Abney. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because those are cases 7 that say your right is not to be tried, your right is 8 not to be exposed to trial at all. 9 MR. ALLEN: That is correct, Your Honor. My 10 only point is that the appellate courts are perfectly 11 capable and able to consider the facts that are at issue 12 in those cases, and it does not unduly burden the 13 appellate process in the context of those type of cases. 14 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask two yes or no 15 questions? One, did you, in fact, ask for a 1292(b) 16 right to appeal, make an interlocutory appeal? 17 MR. ALLEN: No, Your Honor, we did not. 18 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the second question 19 is, would your rule apply if the decision had gone the 20 other way? If they had denied access to the documents, 21 would the other -- would the person seeking discovery 22 have the same right to appeal that you asked for here? 23 MR. ALLEN: No, Your Honor, the -- the party 24 losing the claim would not have the same right to 25 appeal.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why not? 2 MR. ALLEN: I think access to information in 3 the course of discovery does not trigger the same 4 important interest that orders compelling discovery of 5 attorney-client would trigger? So I don't think that 6 they would in any way satisfy that test. And I think, 7 in fact, the question presented as designed even by 8 Respondent does not capture orders that deny the 9 disclosure of attorney-client privilege information. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Some time ago 11 Justice Breyer asked the question of why is this 12 different than the other privileges, and I would like 13 your answer to that. 14 MR. ALLEN: Justice Breyer, I think that the 15 answer to that question has to focus on the role that 16 the privilege plays in the administration of justice, 17 and it's why I went, in response to Justice Sotomayor's 18 question, why I went to the balancing between the 19 interest of the attorney-client privilege versus the 20 interest of a more rigorous application of the final 21 judgment rule. 22 So -- so, while I think it is instructive to 23 compare the privilege to other privileges that the Court 24 may in the future confront, I think the proper analysis 25 is to balance that, that rigorous application of the
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 final judgment rule, to the attorney-client privilege. 2 And I think in that instance it resolves more quickly. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Allen, one of the 4 purposes, one of the -- the underpinnings of 5 Cohen v. Beneficial is that this kind of question is not 6 going to come up very often, but attorney-client 7 privilege, once you say that that's open to -8 everything stops while you go to the court of appeals to 9 get that. And if you -- and if we hold the way you want 10 us to, then a lawyer will be obligated every time she 11 thinks that she has a valid claim to the privilege or 12 that it hasn't been waived, she would be obligated to 13 take an appeal which you are urging would be an appeal 14 of right. 15 MR. ALLEN: Justice Ginsburg, I don't 16 believe that the attorney would be obligated to take the 17 appeal. And I believe that the -- that the facts that 18 we've laid out in our brief with regard to what has 19 actually occurred -- we wonder how many appeals might 20 take place. We know how many appeals might take place, 21 because we have the experience in the Third and the 22 Ninth and the D.C. Circuits that tell us that in the 23 11 years since Ford was decided by Judge Becker in the 24 Third Circuit, the opinion by Judge Becker in the Third 25 Circuit, that there have been only 11 such cases brought
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 up on appeal. So, we have some experience to tell us 2 what will actually happen. 3 But I don't believe it requires that the 4 attorney as a matter of obligation take that appeal. 5 The Court, I believe, dealt with this same issue in the 6 Behrens v. Pelletier case, which is a qualified immunity 7 case, where the Court wondered whether or not there were 8 going to be an increase, a significant increase in 9 the -- the appeals that arose out of -- out of the 10 Court's holding. And the Court observed that the only 11 conclusion that could be reached -- and I believe the 12 Court quoted in that opinion the opinion of Judge 13 Easterbrook in the Able case in the Seventh Circuit -14 that the only conclusion that could be drawn is that 15 there was forebearance by the lawyers in taking appeals 16 that they otherwise had the opportunity to take. I 17 think there is no reason to conclude that there would be 18 a difference in the analysis in -- in the case here. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -- just so I'm 20 clear about your position, are you arguing that all 21 issues related to attorney-client, whether they are 22 waiver, crime or fraud, scope of the privilege, 23 et cetera, that all issues are immediately appealable 24 because the public interest is the same in all cases 25 related to the attorney-client privilege, or are you
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 wanting us to limit this rule only to the waiver cases? 2 MR. ALLEN: Correct, Your Honor. We have 3 asked that the Court address, in this instance, the 4 question presented having to do with only waiver cases. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So -- but your position 6 logically would apply to everything, wouldn't it? 7 MR. ALLEN: Your Honor -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Otherwise, how do we 9 distinguish or make a difference in your analysis? 10 MR. ALLEN: I think it's certainly -- it 11 certainly should be assumed that if this Court rules in 12 our favor, it must conclude that the attorney-client 13 privilege is important. If it concludes that the -14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No one is doubting its 15 importance. The issue is whether or that importance 16 outweighs the finality rule. That's a very different 17 thing for you. 18 MR. ALLEN: I -- I agree. But -- but in 19 order to get to -- to the position we advocate, the 20 Court must pass that threshold and establish importance. 21 If the Court reaches that conclusion it is certainly 22 likely that the importance test in other existence-of23 privilege cases, for example, would obtain. 24 I -- I don't think that compels the 25 conclusion that any case addressing privilege must
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 therefore be permitted collateral order jurisdiction. 2 For example, I believe you recited the crime fraud 3 exception in your question. Certainly crime fraud 4 exception might present a difficulty with prong two of 5 the Cohen analysis, which has to do with the 6 separability of the issue on appeal for merit. So it 7 may well be that in crime fraud cases there is not 8 sufficient separability of the issue from the merits and 9 therefore collateral order jurisdiction would not 10 obtain. 11 As I mentioned earlier, I think we are in 12 agreement that orders that deny the disclosure of 13 information would not be immediately appealable. So 14 there are -- there are a number of instances that this 15 Court might find in what I'll call general privilege 16 cases that might not obtain, and it's the course that 17 the Court has taken in other sort of general areas of 18 law. For example, in the attorney disqualification 19 cases, the Court started off in Firestone finding that 20 orders denying disqualification did not satisfy 21 collateral order jurisdiction and it limited its 22 holdings to -- to that instance. 23 In Flanagan it took up the question of 24 whether or not collateral order jurisdiction obtained in 25 disqualification cases and criminal cases, and in
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Richardson-Merrell in civil cases. So the Court has 2 traditionally taken, if you will, the facts of the case 3 presented to them and limited its rulings to the facts 4 of those cases. We suggest that approach in this case. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any sensible 6 line between an invocation of the privilege, denied, and 7 a holding that the privilege has been waived? I know in 8 your reply brief you -- you draw some kind of a 9 distinction between waiver of the privilege and the 10 existence of the privilege. I didn't follow it. 11 MR. ALLEN: Other than the examples that I 12 --- that I just gave, Your Honor, I don't think there is 13 a principled difference between the finding of 14 importance, and that is -- that is clearly a threshold 15 issue. As Court said in Will, it's the -- the -- what 16 the issues ultimately boil down to. 17 So with regard to that issue I -- I agree, 18 but with regard to crime fraud exception or instances 19 when no disclosure is ordered, another example that I 20 think the Respondent points to in their brief is 21 instances of inadvertent disclosure. Instances of 22 inadvertent disclosure would not trigger the -- the 23 prejudice element necessary because the -- if you will, 24 the cat is in fact already out of the bag at that point. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is another. You
22

1 are stressing the importance of the attorney-client 2 relationship, the work of the attorney. Do you extend 3 your position to work product? It's not privileged. 4 MR. ALLEN: No, Your Honor -5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's certainly -6 it's certainly protected against disclosure. 7 MR. ALLEN: We do not extend the -- the rule 8 that we advocate to work product in the -- in the broad 9 sense. Certainly there are exceptions within Rule 26 to 10 when work product can in fact under the right 11 circumstances be disclosed. So we are not embracing the 12 -- the work product as a general rule. Certainly the 13 mental impressions of client -- of counsel, which is the 14 important exclusion of the work product doctrine in Rule 15 26, we would embrace as a -- as an appropriate 16 limitation on the rule that we are advocating. 17 Mr. Chief Justice, if there are no further 18 questions, may I reserve the remainder of my time? 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 20 Ms. Resnik. 21 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH RESNIK 22 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 23 MS. RESNIK: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, 24 may it please the Court: 25 Before 1997, no circuit held that there was
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 appeal as of right for privilege or waiver, and most of 2 the circuits continue that approach. That is the right 3 approach because attorney-client privilege cases do not 4 fit the parameters of the Cohen appealability and there 5 are alternative responses that are available on the 6 remedial side. In terms of the Cohen factors, the 7 factor of importance which has just been discussed here, 8 this Court has over the 60 years of some 30 opinions 9 refined the importance test and moved it away from the 10 questions of place, shape of litigation, dynamics of 11 litigation, to a very narrow set of cases in which a 12 government is typically a party or a government 13 official, and there is a very significant either 14 constitutional or statutory question principally of 15 immunity from suit. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will get to that, 17 I think, when the government lawyer gets up. But does 18 that distinction make sense to you? 19 MS. RESNIK: I think the -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Government lawyers 21 get the privilege, private lawyers don't? 22 MS. RESNIK: As I understand the 23 government's position here, it's that ordinary lawyers 24 don't get the privilege in ordinary litigation. The 25 government is here to speak to the question of State
24

1 secrets and particular kinds of particular official 2 privileges, but not to the regular case. And I think 3 it's important that we understand from the presence of 4 them that this is a rule that is appropriate for lawyers 5 on all sides of the fence, because the immediate 6 availability of appeal as a right stops in the tracks. 7 The case was decided at the district court in October of 8 2007 and, holding aside these proceedings, it was August 9 of 2008 when the Eleventh Circuit rejected the mandamus 10 and the appeal. 11 So the wisdom of the final judgment rule is 12 precisely because the cost and delay, particularly in 13 the area of discovery and evidentiary privileges, is so 14 significant given that there are so many of these. And 15 one of the important -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we are talking 17 about the central privilege to the maintenance of the 18 adversary system which we've determined to be central to 19 maintaining the rule of law. This is not like the other 20 privileges, priest-penitent, other evidentiary 21 privileges, because it is the privilege that allows 22 lawyers to protect the interests in those other cases. 23 And it just seems to me that -- that to allow a single 24 ruling by a district court judge to undermine the 25 privilege is going to affect people.

1 What -- I mean, the statement of the lawyer 2 could be, look, you are going to lose this case, and you 3 are saying the district court can require the disclosure 4 of that without allowing at least a quick trip to the 5 court of appeals to check it out. 6 MS. RESNIK: Well, there are remedies -7 there are two directions for an answer. One is that in 8 all the courts of appeal of the three circuits that have 9 this rule, work product as well as attorney-client 10 privilege is available on appeal in the Third Circuit. 11 Trade secrets is available, although the Third Circuit 12 has raised questions given Will v. Hallock and 13 Cunningham about whether or not this remains a viable 14 position, but trade secrets is available. 15 Psychotherapists is appealable, spouse is appealable, 16 and nontestifying experts as well. Which is the -17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That is in the Third 18 Circuit. 19 MS. RESNIK: Well, the Third, the Ninth and 20 the D.C. together are the three that have opened up the 21 door, and they have found -- the experience of those 22 appellate judges has not found that it is easy to make 23 the distinction among these, and as a consequence there 24 is appeal as of right to this entire cluster of cases. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Allen has told us
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that there are very few cases, in fact 11 cases in I 2 don't know how many years, in the Third Circuit. 3 MS. RESNIK: Well, I take to be -- the 4 cheerful news is that by and large everyone is getting 5 it right at the trial level. But we are looking at the 6 question -- first of all, one question would be how to 7 count the cases of whether there's these other appeals 8 as well. 9 But more importantly, both the law professor 10 and judge amici in our brief asked to look at the 11 pipeline, and there are two levels of the pipeline, or 12 three. One is that in the district courts we try to 13 look at the numbers of instances when trial judges write 14 opinions, magistrate and district judges, which is only 15 the tip of that iceberg. 16 As best we can tell, somewhere between 10 17 and 30 times a month in Westlaw reports one can find a 18 conclusion either upholding or denying disclosure. 19 Moreover it's sequential -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it matters 21 which they do, right? If they are denying disclosure 22 the statistics don't mean much. 23 MS. RESNIK: We found about half the cases, 24 and the law professors amici and judges amici found 25 about 104, in which in which disclosure was required, in
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the six-month period. So there is a significant number 2 at the trial level that exists in terms of the pipeline. 3 If we go just to the case that is before you, the 4 Federal district judge reserved question on a second 5 attorney-client privilege question because issuing a 6 protective order on the deposition, there is a related 7 case here and he precluded the lawyers from 8 participating in it. 9 JUSTICE ALITO: I was on the Third Circuit 10 for eight years under this regime. And it didn't seem 11 to me that the sky was falling. In fact I can't 12 remember any cases, any appeals involving this issue, 13 and we had lots of cases of a variety of kinds. So 14 maybe there's -- I don't want to be a witness in this, 15 but you know, convince me that the sky really will fall 16 if we were to adopt this. 17 MS. RESNIK: I am not going to convince you 18 that the sky is going to fall, but I am going to suggest 19 that the Cohen rule does not apply to these cases not 20 only because the sky isn't going to fall. The empirical 21 question is there will be more cases for sure and there 22 will be more people with comparable privileges knocking 23 at the appellate doors, and they'll be sorting, so that 24 goes to the county. Do we count the cases that knocked 25 and you said no to as well as the cases you said yes to.

1 The other case is that the Cohen rule 2 requires a particular kind of importance and a 3 particular kind of severability. In this case, the 4 trial judge said, in fairness, there has been a waiver 5 because you've injected new issues in the case. In 6 order to get to the in fairness waiver injection, you 7 have to know the facts of the case and weigh the waiver 8 against the other facts in the case. 9 JUSTICE ALITO: So the Eleventh Circuit was 10 wrong on that issue? Didn't they hold that this was -11 this was separate from the merits? 12 MS. RESNIK: In our view, every one of 13 the -- this case fails the test on all four -- three to 14 four of the Cohen prongs, which is separability and 15 conclusiveness or -- or distinct ideas, potentially, 16 importance, and remediability. And therefore, the 17 embeddedness here is typical of cases, CrimeStar was an 18 example already mentioned, in which the factual 19 predicates are here. In terms of coming back to the 20 piecemeals, in this case the trial judge reserved the 21 question. The lawyers below have asked for a 22 pre-ruling. The questions to be asked at the deposition 23 will not waive attorney-client privilege. The trial 24 judge said, I don't know the answer to that, it hasn't 25 been fully breached and we don't know what you are going
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to ask. Therefore, in this very case, if the rule were 2 that you could appeal as a right, you could be back in 3 this case twice to the Eleventh Circuit during the 4 pendency of the case. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Resnick, can you go 6 back and articulate what you see as the rule that we 7 have on what is important enough? Because that is what 8 really is at question. So how would you articulate a 9 rule that would apply both to the cases in which we have 10 granted interlocutory appeal and to those that you are 11 advocating we don't. Because it's not just freedom from 12 suits like qualified immunity or double jeopardy. We 13 have granted interlocutory appeal in other cases, 14 including in the Cohen case. 15 MS. RESNIK: Well, Cohen involved the major 16 question of the application of the Erie principle in 17 1949 involving a state -- the right of security for 18 expenses. And I would take Cohen and the Vale case and 19 the drugging case of Sell as instances in which, is the 20 litigant, during the pendency of the case, going to be 21 economically secure or free, or drugged or not drugged, 22 as distinct qualities which are all framed in either 23 State law or Constitutional premises. If we look over 24 the course of the 60 years, the category is not neat. 25 But the turning point is in 1978 with the Coopers
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 opinion which says death knell, which says strategic 2 interactions, the shape of class actions, is not 3 available for appeal as a right. 4 In 1994, one might have thought of the 5 digital case that a contract not to continue by -- just 6 settle would have been within the set, but the Court 7 said, no, that kind of private contractual interest is 8 not sufficient. 9 And in 2006, in the Will case, the court 10 narrowed it again by saying the res judicata sequence is 11 insufficient. So in the last decade the Cohen cases 12 have come down to basically qualified immunity or 13 Constitutionally-freighted -- structural or almost 14 abstract, not interpersonal dynamics of the litigation, 15 including contractual relationships or evidentiary 16 privileges. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But are you suggesting 18 that -- that Cohen itself wouldn't come out the same way 19 today if the question of security for costs, whether 20 State or Federal, hadn't been settled? 21 MS. RESNIK: Well, Cohen predates this -22 the Congress's creation of 1292(b), which you mentioned 23 earlier, Justice Ginsburg. And so what it is looking at 24 is, when Cohen was initially decided it opened a window, 25 but in the relationship between Court and Congress, the
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 judicial conference went to the Congress and said, We 2 need a broader window, and Congress adopted verbatim in 3 1958 the 1292(b) criteria which, clearly, Cohen would 4 have been eligible for or potentially eligible for, and 5 there are attorney-client privilege cases that do go off 6 under 1292(b). 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it is a bit of a 8 hurdle, isn't it, since you do have to satisfy the 9 materially advanced -- the litigation and those other 10 criteria? 11 MS. RESNIK: There are a few selective 12 waiver cases. There are a few of these that come up, 13 but you are completely right that it is a hurdle but we 14 have alternatives here as well. As the example of the 15 -- once the Federal Court Study Committee suggested we 16 needed more appeal rights after the Coopers case, 17 Congress responded by authorizing the Court through its 18 rulemaking to provide interlocutory orders as final, and 19 23(f) is the next example, which also provides the 20 mechanism. 21 The basic point is that there are other 22 routes. The remedial prong of Cohen is amply responded 23 to here, because first, internal to the case, there 24 could be protective orders and limited disclosure. 25 Second, you can take the issue and stipulate it against
32

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 you. Third, you could actually, if you ever did go to 2 trial, not testify. That's the Jackie B. Redman 3 scenario. Fourth, you have the after-a-fact appeal. 4 Fifth, mandamus is available, and there are circuit 5 courts. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that is only in 7 egregious cases. 8 MS. RESNIK: In the extraordinary case there 9 is mandamus. There is also certification, and all of 10 these are routes that are filtered. Cohen opens the 11 door completely. 12 JUSTICE ALITO: Are you -- are you arguing 13 that the collateral order door is closed now? That -14 that nobody else is going to get through that door? 15 MS. RESNIK: I can't forecast future cases, 16 except to say that this Court has repeatedly in the last 17 decade narrowed the door substantially. And I take it 18 it has come in relationship to the door opening through 19 the other mechanisms, Congressional carve-ups like the 20 Classified Informations Procedure Act, the Congressional 21 carve-up in Catha, and each of those isn't a wide-open 22 door, but either discretionary or timeframed or limited. 23 And of course, that goes to the problem that an 24 interlocutory appeal really is interlocutory and stops 25 everything, whereas the 23(f) rule says after the court
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 order, there's nothing stayed at the district court 2 level. 3 JUSTICE ALITO: An interlocutory appeal 4 doesn't have to stop everything, does it? 5 MS. RESNIK: The -- as a rule of filing a 6 notice of appeal with a court of appeal at the -- a 7 statutory rule provision puts the -- stays the district 8 court activity. That's why 23(f) moderates that rule, 9 as I understand it. 10 Further, I wanted to come back to the 11 question here in terms of importance. Rule 501 and 502 12 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, Number 502 has just 13 been reworked. 501 remains that in some of these the 14 existence of the privilege will arise -- will be a 15 question of state law. I know of no one of the Erie 16 cases in which the interlocutory appellate question 17 turns on the question of state law as a predicate, and 18 the D.C. Circuit rule is that it's when there's an 19 adverse privilege ruling that you get appeal as a right. 20 It's -- that's the D.C. circuit's rule for -- and 21 indeed, it had several of these, not very many, but a 22 few of these cases. 23 So then 502 has just come with the workings 24 of the judicial conference and the Congress together, 25 and the lawyers, to shape a rule that is very protective
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of inadvertent waiver, protective about its sequential 2 impacts as well, and articulating and Federalizing that 3 area of law, as well as providing under 502(a) for -- if 4 you waive in the course of a Federal proceeding, 502 5 organizes the way a district court should think about 6 it. 7 If there were appeal as a right of waiver 8 right now, after this case, then all those 502 cases 9 could come directly, whereas instead a few might get 10 here or not by 1292(b). And again, if it looked like 11 there needed to be a wholesale reworking because of the 12 vulnerability of the system, then the Court and 13 committee working with the lawyers can draft together 14 some revision. But the -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The usual way that 16 the district court, after denying the recognition of the 17 privilege, insists that people proceed is, they want the 18 lawyer to go to jail. They say, You've got contempt, 19 you can appeal contempt. The district judges, as you've 20 mentioned, they want these things to move on and they 21 tend not to think that their rulings are in error, and 22 the lawyers are frequently confronted with an extremely 23 difficult choice, of violating what they think is their 24 ethical obligation or going to jail. 25 MS. RESNIK: Well, it is the case that Judge
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Wilkinson recently reiterated Judge Friendly's 2 suggestion that -- or commentary that contempt is a 3 provision that is available. And it is a route. But 4 we've found -5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how -- how is it -6 unless the judge cooperates, it has to be criminal 7 contempt. It wouldn't be civil contempt. The judge 8 says, I'm not going to hold you, and -9 MS. RESNIK: What -- we have found that many 10 courts of appeals have responded, precisely because of 11 either the draconian nature of criminal contempt or the 12 possibility that it won't issue, by looking at some of 13 these cases, in the extraordinary instance, through 14 mandamus and there are at least a dozen mandamus -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But mandamus is supposed 16 -- not supposed to be a run about the final judgment 17 rule, and if -- and if Cohen v. Beneficial is available, 18 then mandamus would not lie, right? 19 MS. RESNIK: That is directly -- that is 20 exactly correct, yes. It is that the appeal of these 21 unappealing groups is because the final judgment rule 22 says even if there is an error and even if it's a very 23 important error, absent this very narrow category of 24 cases that are final through our gloss on Cohen, the 25 basic plan is you wait till the end.

1 In this instance, this district judge, in 2 the related case, certified under 1292(b), the RICO 3 question that came back -- came up to this Court, it 4 also had a 23(f) appeal in this case. 5 So this is actually a textbook case, if you 6 will, of watching both the pros and cons of 7 interlocutory appellate review, and, in this instance, 8 what we see is that the district court, here, said this 9 is too run-of-the-mill for 1292(b). 10 However, if you want, cooperating with the 11 lawyers, I will -- I will put everything in abeyance, if 12 you want to seek mandamus. And so the district judge 13 was attentive to the lawyers' concerns, moreover because 14 the district judge has put a protective order on related 15 materials. 16 We have an example of a district judge, who 17 is very aware of the parameters of the litigation, and 18 that goes to remedies. We dont' know -19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, a protective 20 order isn't going to work -- a protective order isn't 21 going to work at all. You're not going to -- I mean, 22 the lawyers on the other side get the privileged 23 material, so they don't care -- I mean, in terms of the 24 viability and protection of the privilege, it doesn't 25 matter if the clients get it.

The rare instances 4 in which a trial judge affirmatively makes a finding of 5 waiver through conduct, in this instance or in some 6 other way, are going to not undermine the privilege in 7 its initial formation, and the final judgment rule has 8 said, repeatedly, We could get it wrong on class action 9 certification. We could get it wrong on attorney 10 disqualification. 11 Nevertheless, the costs of the final 12 judgment rule are so substantial -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the -- you 14 know, the -- the American Bar Association has said the 15 exact opposite.

So we could watch the 21 sequence of a frequent, repetitious return back and 22 forth to the court of appeals on this kind of privilege 23 and, potentially, on other kinds of privileges. 24 Thank you very much. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.

KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 7 please the Court. In the last 15 years, this Court, in 8 applying the principles of Cohen, has repeatedly 9 stressed that a necessary requirement is that the order 10 involved and the issues implicated be important and, 11 particularly, that the issues be so important as to 12 outweigh the values served by the important and usual 13 rule of a final judgment requirement. 14 In our view, the denial of an assertion of 15 attorney-client privilege in an individual case does not 16 rise to that level and to the -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, except when 18 the government is the one raising it. 19 MR. KNEEDLER: No. We do not -- we -- to be 20 clear, we are not asserting that an -- that an assertion 21 of attorney-client privilege by the government is -- is 22 immediately -23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but, in the 24 government context, what would be in the private 25 context, an attorney-client privilege, is redressed as a
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 different type of governmental privilege. 2 When you give advice to a government agency, 3 you don't call that the attorney-client privilege. You 4 call it a governmental privilege, a deliberative 5 privilege, all these other things. 6 In the private sector, when you are an 7 attorney and you give advice to a client, you can't say, 8 This has got something. It's the attorney-client 9 privilege. 10 MR. KNEEDLER: Let me also stress, we are 11 not arguing that a denial of the assertion of the 12 deliberative process privilege is immediately 13 appealable. 14 Our -- the -- the submission that we make in 15 the latter part of our brief, and that we urge the Court 16 not to foreclose here, is the Presidential 17 communications privilege, which applies to 18 communications involving the President or his top 19 advisors. 20 And we also say that the State secrets 21 privilege raises similar concerns. Both of those serve 22 functions of constitutional significance. We do not 23 make the same claim about -- about the general 24 government privilege for deliberative process. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are saying

1 that you -- government lawyers cannot seek an 2 interlocutory appeal of any privilege claimed, other 3 than Presidential communications and State secrets? 4 MR.

KNEEDLER: That -- that would be -- that 10 would be available in an appropriate case. There are 11 the -- there are the limitations. We trust that a court 12 would -- would grant that, but these -- these are 13 interests of the highest order. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. There 15 are problems with 1292(b). Are you telling me, when 16 your office writes a letter to the Department of 17 Interior and says, Look, we are not going to appeal -18 we will appeal your case, but we think you have got a 19 really bad case, you are likely to lose; and you 20 assert -- the only privilege you can assert is the 21 attorney-client privilege, and, if a district judge 22 says, that's not covered, for one reason or another, 23 you -- you don't get an interlocutory appeal? 24 MR. KNEEDLER: No. Not -- we don't get an 25 interlocutory appeal under -- under 1291. No. We are
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

And, for the 2 two particular privileges that -- that we have 3 identified in our -- in our brief, it is possible that 4 1292(b) certification would be granted by the -- by the 5 Court, but it is also possible that it would not. 6 And I -- I would like to -- I would like to 7 identify -- and I think Justice Sotomayor asked about -8 about a test for importance, and the Court, in its 9 recent decision in Will, tried to summarize what -- what 10 it has been driving at over the last 15 years on this 11 importance prong and whether the importance outweighs 12 the -- the final judgment values. 13 And what the Court said there is that there 14 has -- that the denial of an immediate appeal has to 15 undermine -- let me -- let me quote -- "has to undermine 16 some particular value of high order." 17 And then the Court identified the things 18 that have fallen into that category. It mentioned 19 separation of powers. The Court mentioned disruption of 20 government operations through the denial of qualified 21 immunity, and I would add the denial of statutory 22 immunity under the Westfall Act to that. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't think that 24 the attorney-client privileges rises to the level of who 25 gets to -- who has to put up security for costs that was

1 an issue in Cohen? 2 MR. KNEEDLER: We -- I think the -- I do 3 not. And I think the problem is that the denial of 4 attorney-client privilege is tied up with discovery of 5 the sort that happens every day in Federal Court. It's 6 bound up with -- with discovery plans, that -7 objections on relevance, materiality, various -- various 8 privileges. 9 One of the important values served by the 10 final judgment rule is that the conduct of -- of 11 district court proceedings like that is committed to the 12 judgment and discretion of the district court, and if a 13 disappointed litigant could automatically run to the 14 court of appeals that undermines the ability of the 15 district court judge to manage the day-to-day -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We are not talking 17 about -- I guess what, perhaps, the case comes down to 18 is, if you think the attorney-client privilege is like 19 every other evidentiary privilege that you have just 20 listed, relevance, materiality, all those sorts of 21 things, or if you think the attorney-client privilege is 22 different, even more important than who has to post 23 security for costs, because it is central to the rule of 24 law, because it is central to how the adversary system 25 functions.

1 MR. KNEEDLER: I think the more precise 2 question, Mr. Chief Justice, is whether the -- the 3 question is whether the denial of an attorney-client 4 privilege threatens to -- so substantially undermine the 5 values of the privilege to warrant an immediate appeal, 6 and I think, as has been pointed out by several of the 7 Justices here, there are -- there are exceptions to the 8 privilege, which -- which will -- might undermine the 9 confidence people might have in it. There are 10 uncertainties at trial. These are often fact-based 11 determinations that would be subject to clearly 12 erroneous review on appeal. The very sorts of reasons 13 why issues like this are committed to the district 14 court's discretion and reviewed on final judgment when 15 you can find out whether the error actually made a 16 difference on a particular case. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the review -- I 18 follow your answer but the review on final judgment is 19 meaningless. I mean, the cat is out of the bag. 20 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, it's not entirely 21 meaningless. It can -- if the evidence was used in the 22 trial and had -- had a substantial impact you can have a 23 reversal of the judgment, and -- and the -- the injury 24 can be mitigated by saying that the -- that the evidence 25 cannot be -- cannot be used in the retrial.

KNEEDLER: Well, again, the -- the 6 question is -- the attorney/client privilege is not for 7 competence in its own right but to encourage frank 8 communications in order to promote litigation in the 9 function of lawyers. And the question is whether the 10 denial of a privilege in a particular case will so 11 undermine that privilege as a general matter to warrant 12 an immediate appeal. And we think the answer is clearly 13 no. And also the loss of the privilege to the 14 individual litigant we think is not a sufficient basis, 15 because the other cases that I mentioned, and that the 16 Court identified in Will are situations where the injury 17 transcends the particular case. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, I think I 19 have this right, but correct me if I am wrong. I 20 thought in Cohen v. Beneficial, it wasn't just a 21 question that we would like to get this legal question 22 settled, but, in fact, for many plaintiffs if security 23 for costs was something that the Plaintiff has to put up 24 up front, that would be the end of the lawsuit. It 25 would be the practical end of the lawsuit. Unlike in an

1 attorney-client privilege, the suit goes on. 2 So Cohen v. Beneficial wasn't simply that 3 this was an important question unsettled under Erie, it 4 is the practical reality that plaintiffs who had to put 5 up security costs would be out of -6 MR. KNEEDLER: That's -- that's a very 7 important -- that's a very important point. And I think 8 that -9 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Kneedler, is true 10 that true, that the case goes on? Isn't it true that of 11 the civil cases that get through discovery, only a tiny 12 percentage ever come to an appealable final judgment? 13 The vast, vast majority of these things are settled, are 14 they not? 15 MR. KNEEDLER: They are. And I -- I -- I 16 think that supports the point for not having immediate 17 appealable -18 JUSTICE ALITO: Right, because there never 19 could be an appeal. 20 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, but the -21 JUSTICE ALITO: It means that the 22 erroneous -- if there was an erroneous ruling, it's 23 built into the -- it's irretrievably built into -- well 24 not irretrievably, but powerfully built into the 25 bargaining --

1 MR. KNEEDLER: But that's the nature of 2 trial proceedings and discovery. Judges may make 3 erroneous rulings. And this Court, again, acknowledged 4 in Will that the purpose of the final judgment rule is 5 no to protect -- prevent particular injustices that 6 might happen in a particular case. Again, to go back to 7 what the Court has stressed, there has to be a -- a -- a 8 value, and the Court said constitutional or statutory or 9 something with a large public pedigree where the -10 where the injury will -- will not be -- where the 11 weighing of the costs and benefits comes out quite 12 differently. 13 JUSTICE ALITO: If the privilege were in a 14 statute, that would make a difference? 15 MR. KNEEDLER: I don't think so if there was 16 a statute that just codified the -- the privileges like 17 this. What I -- what I -- what I was suggesting is 18 there might be a statute that would identify a 19 particular governmental interest as in the D.C. 20 Circuit's decision in the -- in the -21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Putting aside the 22 question of whether the attorney-client privilege has a 23 good pedigree in public law, my experience has been that 24 litigants on one side frequently request and demand in 25 discovery material that they know is covered by the
49

1 attorney-client privilege, one, precisely because that's 2 where the good stuff is; and two, because it gives them 3 leverage, because they know that the other side is going 4 to have to go through this impossible process and can't 5 get an immediate appeal. 6 Why isn't that a concern that we should 7 have? 8 MR. KNEEDLER: I think and that's a -9 district judges are -- are -- who manage these cases 10 every day can see through that, and -- and -- and can be 11 trusted to, by and large, make correct results. It may 12 be that there will be an occasional erroneous 13 determination. But, again, as for privileges generally, 14 that's -- that's so. 15 I did want to make one final point about -16 about irreparable injury. For the sorts of privileges 17 that we have identified in -- in our brief, the -- the 18 presidential communications privilege and whatnot, 19 that -- that harm is immediate and broad on behalf of 20 the nation as a whole. That is a different question 21 from the harm to a particular litigant when a privilege 22 is denied in a particular case and it doesn't undermine 23 the broader purposes of the privilege. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 25 Mr. Kneedler.

1 Mr. Allen, you have four minutes remaining. 2 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL L. ALLEN 3 ON BEHALF THE PETITIONER 4 MR. ALLEN: I would like to address the 5 question that Justice Alito raised with regard to 6 whether or not an appeal of a collateral issue dealing 7 with waiver or privilege would stay the litigation. The 8 answer is it does not. The case remains with the 9 district court, the district court is empowered to 10 manage the case. Only the question addressing the issue 11 would go up with collateral order jurisdiction. Indeed, 12 in this case, the court did not stay the litigation 13 below. So, the court maintains that ability to manage 14 its own docket. To be sure -15 JUSTICE STEVENS: It certainly doesn't go 16 ahead with the trial, does it? 17 MR. ALLEN: He has not gone ahead with the 18 trial. 19 JUSTICE STEVENS: It never would, would it? 20 MR. ALLEN: He is certainly empowered to do 21 so. 22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, just go ahead with 23 trial while a material issue is still pending, I can't 24 imagine that. 25 MR. ALLEN: Your Honor, the scenario that
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 you raise would put the attorney or the client, 2 depending on who is in the box, if you will, to some 3 hard choices. But there are two ways that the case 4 stays: Either the district court has to order that the 5 case stays or on appeal the court of appeals has to 6 order that the case stays. The parties and their 7 counsel cannot stay the case. 8 So, I agree with you that it could be a 9 difficult situation for the parties. 10 JUSTICE STEVENS: I can't imagine a judge 11 going to trial in a case when an important issue like 12 this is pending on appeal. Has that ever happened? 13 MR. ALLEN: I am unaware that it has -- it 14 has ever happened, Your Honor, and I hope it doesn't. 15 But the -- but point is that the district court 16 maintains that power and authority to run -- to run its 17 courtroom. 18 The United States cites Will for the 19 proposition that -- that the collateral order doctrine 20 is designed to impact some particular value of high 21 order, and it recites from Will a number of those 22 particular values of high order, including qualified 23 immunity. As this Court recognized in -- in Harlow, 24 a -- a doctrine of common law origin, much like the 25 attorney-client privilege, the -- the doctrine in
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Harlow, qualified immunity is designed to impact and 2 affect the efficient operation of government. 3 The design of the attorney-client privilege 4 is intended to have the same impact on the efficient and 5 effective operation of the administration of justice. 6 If I could go back, Justice Breyer, to the 7 question that you raised with regard to other privilege. 8 I would suggest that a holding in this case in our favor 9 would have no impact on the Court's later determination 10 of privileges of husband, wife, spousal privileges, or 11 of priest and penitent type privileges. I would suggest 12 that the better course would be to examine a case that 13 develops the importance or the impact of those 14 privileges, but certainly with regard, for example, to 15 spousal immunity or spousal privilege, the way that the 16 States recognize them -- I believe that all 50 States 17 recognize spousal privilege -- is varied. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so, I think any 19 system of -- that denies you the interlocutory appeal, 20 will, in fact, work some injustice. I have no doubt 21 about that. Any system that allows too many 22 interlocutory appeals wrecks the judicial system through 23 delay. 24 Now, I think on that kind of question which 25 is here, maybe there is some information that you come
53

1 across with the ABA, for example, that has 300,000 -2 maybe 600 -- you know, hundreds of thousands of members. 3 There might be instances in the circuits where appeal 4 was denied, where the lawyers would say, my goodness, 5 appeal was denied, I want to tell you the hardship that 6 that worked. 7 Has anyone gone around and tried to find if 8 there are such instances, as there must be, how serious 9 it was? How harmful, how often do we have any empirical 10 information on that question? 11 MR. ALLEN: Your Honor, I do not have any 12 empirical information to answer that question. But to 13 go to the -- to the -- to the underlying premise of 14 whether or not those other cases might generate some 15 flood gate, if you will, I think we have -- we have 16 answered to be clear with Respondent's description of 17 our counting. I don't think it is a statistical 18 analysis. We simply counted the actual appeals, 11. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Is it wrong for me to 20 expect that if this would work, a lot of instances of 21 serious hardship not allowing the appeal, some lawyers 22 in their meetings would be upset and they would raise a 23 few examples? So doesn't the fact that you have been 24 unable to find any tend to count against you? 25 MR. ALLEN: I don't believe it does, Your
