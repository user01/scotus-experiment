 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 
 4 argument next this morning in Case Number 11-1118, 
 5 Gunn v. Minton. 
 6 Ms. Webre? 
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANE WEBRE 
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 9 MS. WEBRE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 
 10 please the Court: 11 In Grable, this Court explained that 12 "arising under" jurisdiction demands, not only a 13 contested Federal issue, but a substantial one embedded 14 in a State claim in order to indicate whether there is a 15 serious Federal interest in exercising Federal 16 jurisdiction over the State claim. 17 This Court should reverse the judgment below 18 because Minton -- Mr. Minton's claims do not present a 19 substantial Federal issue, and exercising Federal 20 jurisdiction over his claim and legal malpractice claims 21 like his, State legal malpractice claims would -22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The question is whether 23 the experimental use -- whether that was a viable 24 theory. Why isn't that a substantial -- what do you 25 mean by, "substantial"?

1 MS. WEBRE: Well, Your Honor, defining 2 substantiality is a difficult point. I -- I would 3 answer in two layers. First, Mr. Minton's claim did not 4 involve a legal question of does the -- how does the 5 experimental use doctrine work; how is it applied, what 6 are its parameters? 7 The question was did his fact-bound and 8 situation-specific affidavit present relevant evidence 9 of the application here in this particular case. And it 10 is not a substantial question because, first, from a -11 a unique case perspective, it involved merely a 12 hypothetical determination. 13 There were no actual patent rights that 14 would be at issue. Those were already fully, finally, 15 irrevocably determined in the underlying patent 16 litigation in Federal court. 17 And, second, from a jurisprudence 18 standpoint, the -- the question of uniformity of patent 19 law, any decision by a State court, in Mr. Minton's 20 legal malpractice claim, would not be binding in any 21 way, on either the PTO in a patent application, or on 22 any subsequent Federal court deciding a real patent 23 case. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you mean substantial 25 beyond the -- the -- this particular case?

1 MS. WEBRE: Yes, Your Honor. And I -- I 2 think that that's where the Federal circuit's 3 jurisdictional -- the Federal circuit's "arising under" 4 jurisdiction standard, which the Supreme Court of Texas 5 applied here, that's exactly where it goes awry, is that 6 the court improperly conflates the -- the question of 7 necessity of a Federal issue with the question of 8 whether that issue is substantial. 9 And, in the Grable case, this Court 10 emphasized that those are two separate issues. There 11 are four prongs to the Grable test. The Federal issue 12 embedded in the State claim must be necessary to the 13 State claim; actually disputed; substantial; and then 14 there is a federalism inquiry that exercised a Federal 15 jurisdiction over this State claim can't upend the 16 proper balance between State and Federal authority. 17 The Grable court announced that, and then 18 just a year later, in the Empire HealthChoice case, Your 19 Honor -- Justice Ginsburg, you wrote that opinion for 20 the Court, and that acted sort of as an underscoring of 21 "and here's how limited the Grable rule really is." 22 The Empire HealthChoice opinion 23 distinguishes between Grable, which presented a merely 24 pure question of law, and the claims at issue in Empire 25 HealthChoice which were fact-bound and
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 situation-specific. It distinguished the -- the 2 question of whether a State court is competent to apply 3 Federal law to the extent relevant to the claims and 4 found that, yes, it was. 5 And the -- the Court emphasized that, 6 certainly, the State courts are going to be deciding the 7 occasional Federal issue here and there, but let's not 8 make a Federal case out of each and every State tort 9 claim that might have an embedded Federal issue. 10 Now, in the earlier argument, there was some 11 discussion of the fact that jurisdiction means a lot of 12 different things in a lot of different contexts. But, 13 here, this Court has, on more than one occasion, 14 determined that jurisdiction -- "arising under" 15 jurisdiction means the same thing in 1331, the general 16 Federal question jurisdictional grant, and 1338(a), 17 the -- the exclusive provision that's applicable 18 specifically to patents. 19 Now, that has been amended slightly. It -20 it, now, includes compulsory counterclaims where they 21 didn't used to be a part, but the jurisdictional grant 22 that Congress gave through the first sentence of 1338(a) 23 uses the same exact phrase, the "arising under," "any 24 civil action arising under Federal law." 25 And, Justice Scalia, you wrote the opinion
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 for the Court in the Holmes Group case and explained 2 that the linguistic consistency between those two means 3 that they mean the same thing. 4 There is nothing unique about this subject 5 matter -- the patent subject matter, that changes the 6 scope of the jurisdictional grant. To be sure, the -7 the grant of original jurisdiction to the district 8 courts is exclusive, and that is different from the 9 general Federal question. 10 And to be -11 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why isn't that 12 significant? Doesn't that manifest Congress's view 13 that -- that -- that this is -- that this is a 14 complicated specialty area? And so there would be, 15 arguably, a special reason for having these cases, cases 16 that involve a patent issue, in Federal court, rather 17 than State court? 18 MS. WEBRE: Yes, Your Honor. But the -19 Congress did that in a couple of different ways. First 20 of all, I think it begs the question -- it begs the -21 the core question, to say that exclusive -- the fact 22 that jurisdiction is exclusive answers the 23 substantiality because, in order to get to exclusivity 24 of the jurisdiction, you have to get to jurisdiction 25 first.
7

1 You have to -- it has to be "arising under" 2 an act of Congress relating to patents before it can 3 then be exclusive. So -- so we still have the first 4 step. But, also, Congress did not cast the net broader 5 than the general "arising under" standard. 6 Even under the -- the statutory framework 7 after the America Invents Act amendment -- under the 8 statutory structure, there are still a number of patent 9 issues -- legal issues that are going to be decided in 10 the State courts that do not come within the exclusive 11 jurisdiction of the Federal courts. For example, 12 compulsory counterclaims, now, come within the exclusive 13 jurisdiction, but permissive counterclaims don't. 14 Permissive counterclaims can certainly 15 present just as substantive a question of patent law, 16 and, yet, those are excluded under the statutory scheme 17 of 1338(a). Patent issues raised as a defensive matter 18 are not sufficient to support "arising under" 19 jurisdiction under 1338(a). 20 So, certainly, Congress contemplated a 21 situation where some patent issues are just not going to 22 come within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal 23 courts. 24 And I think it's interesting to -- to back 25 up a little bit and look at the Federal circuit's
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 evolved perception of its own exclusive jurisdiction. 2 In the early years of the Federal circuit, in 1984, the 3 first Chief Justice -- the first chief judge of the 4 court, Chief Judge Markey, in the Atari case that is 5 cited at page 21 of the amicus brief filed by the 6 American Intellectual Property Lawyers Association, the 7 Federal circuit wrote, "Congress was not concerned that 8 an occasional patent law decision of a regional circuit 9 court or of a State court would defeat its goal of 10 increased uniformity in the national law of patents." 11 And that was the view of the Federal 12 circuit's own jurisdiction in 1984. But, in the time 13 evolved, the Federal circuit has changed its perception 14 of its own jurisdiction, and that's why we are here 15 today, is, in 2007, the Federal circuit went awry and -16 and changed the standard that no longer follows what 17 this Court articulated in Grable. 18 They -- they have improperly conflated the 19 necessity and substantiality components of the -- of an 20 appropriate Grable analysis. And they totally disregard 21 a proper balance of the State and Federal interests. 22 The Federal circuit announced that there's an interest 23 in -- Federal interest in uniformity of patent law, and 24 then that was that. That was the end of the inquiry. 25 There is no balance if you don't look at the State
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 interest on the other side. 2 And, in legal malpractice cases, in general 3 and in Mr. Minton's claim in particular, there are 4 substantial State interests. There is the general 5 interest, the right of a State to develop its own State 6 claims, its own State law, and its own State courts. 7 But there is also a State interest in 8 governing the relationship between attorney and client 9 that happens through the legal malpractice process. 10 But, specifically, with regard to Mr. Minton's claim, 11 one of his primary theories in -- in this case -- in the 12 legal malpractice case, is that the attorney's error, 13 with regard to bringing up the Experimental Use 14 Doctrine, deprived him of the opportunity to make a 15 lucrative settlement with the NASD in the underlying 16 patent litigation. 17 Well, the question of exactly how you prove 18 whether and to what extent the NASD would have paid a 19 settlement and for how much in the underlying case is a 20 matter of tremendous dispute right now. That is an 21 evolving issue in the -- in the legal malpractice 22 jurisprudence of the State of Texas. 23 In fact, in the month of December 2012, the 24 Supreme Court of Texas heard argument in a case called 25 Elizondo v. Krist that addresses that precise issue.

1 How do you prove that NASDAQ would have paid him 2 $100 million, if only these lawyers had raised this 3 issue earlier? 4 And, yet, if this -- if Mr. Minton's claims 5 are hailed into Federal court because of the fact-bound 6 and situation-specific application of the Experimental 7 Law Doctrine, the Federal courts would be Erie guessers 8 as to that important issue that the State courts really 9 need to resolve. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Webre, is there any 11 binding effect of a Federal determination here on State 12 law? And is there any binding effect of any State 13 determination here on Federal law? 14 MS. WEBRE: No, Your Honor. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: If it was left to the 16 State, would what the States say about -- about patent 17 law be binding in any Federal cases? And, vice-versa, 18 if it went to the Federal jurisdiction, would anything 19 that the Federal court says about -- about State tort 20 law be binding on State courts? 21 MS. WEBRE: In neither direction would any 22 decision be binding. The -- the State -- any decision 23 in a State court on a legal malpractice matter regarding 24 issues of patent law would not be binding in any way on 25 the Federal courts or on the PTO in handling any of the
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 patent applications -- prosecution of patents. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that -- that being 3 so, your -- your last argument about the Federal 4 government messing up -- you know, State tort law in an 5 area that -- that is currently very much in the fore in 6 the -- in the decisions of the Texas Supreme Court, that 7 doesn't really carry a lot of weight, except in this 8 single case. 9 I mean, they are not going to mess up Texas 10 law in that regard. They may get this case wrong, 11 but -12 MS. WEBRE: You -- you are right that -13 that it will not, substantially, adversely impact Texas 14 State law, but that's an illustration of a substantial 15 State interest. 16 And, in a way, it's akin to the issue in 17 Grable because the -- the embedded issue in Grable that 18 justified this Court reaching down and grabbing a State 19 law claim and bringing it up into Federal courts wasn't 20 just that the issue was disputed, the -- the 21 construction of that statute was unresolved. But that 22 it needed resolving. It needed resolving by a court 23 whose decision could be precedential, so then it's 24 resolved from then on. 25 And so the -- the question of how do you
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 prove a settlement is an issue that needs resolving by a 2 court who's going to advance the jurisprudence. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about the Federal 4 issue? Doesn't that need resolving? 5 MS. WEBRE: There are no Federal issues that 6 need resolving here because it's solely a question of 7 the application of these specific facts in this 8 affidavit to the doctrine. There's -- there's no 9 overarching question of -- of patent law that needs 10 resolving. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me -- me ask this 12 question: Suppose you have two cases, hypothetical, 13 case A, case B, both involve the Experimental Use 14 Doctrine in Federal patent law. In case A, it's a very 15 weak argument; it's most unlikely it's not going to 16 apply. Case B, very strong argument, Experimental Use 17 Doctrine applies. 18 Any difference in the removability in those 19 two cases? 20 MS. WEBRE: I don't believe so, Your Honor, 21 because the question isn't the -- the significance to 22 the particular claim. The question is the Federal 23 issue. Is there a -24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if -- if you say -25 since you're going to say it -- I mean, if it's a
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 "substantial" Federal issue, then it's substantial in 2 hypothetical B, but not in hypothetical A? 3 MS. WEBRE: Well, it's -- it's, perhaps, 4 more necessary. But -- and maybe what I need to do is 5 back up a little bit and discuss what I think are the 6 factors for a court to look at, when deciding whether or 7 not an embedded Federal issue is a substantial one. 8 And looking at this -- this Court's 9 articulation in the Grable case and the Empire 10 HealthChoice case, the -- the issues that the Court 11 looked at -- one was the nature of the Federal -- of the 12 Federal question itself -- the Federal issue, is it a 13 constitutional issue? 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So does that mean that, 15 if the claim in the malpractice action is that the PTO 16 acted unconstitutionally -- assume that set of facts -17 how does that change your analysis? 18 MS. WEBRE: That -- that would be a more 19 substantial Federal question than the one presented 20 here, but I submit that it would not be sufficient to 21 warrant "arising under" jurisdiction here because it 22 is -- it involves only a hypothetical actual set of 23 patent rights. No judgment that can happen in a State 24 legal malpractice case actually impacts any patent 25 rights.

1 Let's say Mr. Minton won a judgment from a 2 State legal malpractice court saying, it was the 3 negligence, that you would have won the experimental use 4 exception, your patent would have been declared valid. 5 And so he has a judgment from a State court saying, 6 the -- the loss of your patent was the result of the 7 negligence and not because it was actually invalid. 8 That doesn't give him a valid patent. He 9 cannot take that judgment and then sue somebody and say, 10 look, look, I've got a patent. And it's -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So go back to -- you 12 were going through a list of questions, and I posited 13 let's assume that the malpractice claim does involve a 14 constitutional question. 15 MS. WEBRE: Yes. So -16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then what other 17 factors -18 MS. WEBRE: Well, the -- the -- in the 19 continuum constitutional issues would be more 20 substantial; statutory issues would be a little less 21 substantial. In fact, this Court grappled with that in 22 the Grable case and said, we're not going to draw a hard 23 and fast line on statutory issues. 24 But then, in the Empire HealthChoice 25 opinion, the Court noted that this is a -- the issue -
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the Federal issue there was nonstatutory, and so, 2 therefore, let's not make a Federal case out of it. So, 3 in that continuum, that would be one factor to look at. 4 Another factor to look at would be, is the 5 Federal issue -- the legal issue undisputed or 6 uncertain? Not necessarily the application of these 7 particular facts to the legal issue because there really 8 isn't a Federal interest in how this affidavit is 9 construed or not. 10 But, in -- in the resolution of the legal 11 issues, as in Grable, is the question of law disputed or 12 uncertain? And the corollary to that is does it need 13 resolving? Because that was the situation in the Grable 14 case. But just because an issue is novel doesn't ipso 15 facto make it a -- a substantial issue. 16 This Court, in the Merrell Dow case, 17 discussed that, that -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why do all -- why do 19 all of these issues cut in your favor, in all cases 20 involving malpractice? I mean, you're urging, not just 21 that your client win here, but you want us to adopt a 22 general rule that malpractice suits involving patent 23 rights can never, ever come under "Federal arising" 24 under jurisdiction. 25 Isn't that -- isn't that what you want us to
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 say? 2 MS. WEBRE: Yes, Your Honor. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the burden would be on 4 you to show that every one of these factors, in all of 5 those cases, is always going to cut in your favor. 6 That -- what, that they will never involve a 7 constitutional issue? That they will never, ever 8 determine future patent decisions? 9 MS. WEBRE: Well, Your Honor, I -- I urge 10 that because I think that's the only appropriate 11 application of the Grable test to legal malpractice 12 cases. And it's not that -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I like -- I like 14 bright-line rules. In fact -- you know, I thought 15 Holmes had it right. It doesn't arise under, unless the 16 cause of action is a Federal cause of action. But once 17 we've gone down -- down the road of Grable, I don't -18 you're -- you're proving a negative. 19 The burden is on you to prove a negative, 20 that there is no situation that can arise in -- in 21 malpractice cases involving patents where the Federal 22 issue would justify arising under jurisdiction. That's 23 a hard road to hoe. 24 MS. WEBRE: I think there are two reasons -25 there are two reasons why that's the only appropriate
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 way to apply the Grable test to legal malpractice cases, 2 and both of them involve the lack of precedent from the 3 case. 4 One is it can never involve actual patent 5 rights. The consequence of a judge's -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about fraud on -- a 7 claim of fraud on -- that the malpractice was fraud on 8 the PTO? Lawyer loses that. It's been litigated. 9 Isn't it res judicata, and won't it affect the patent -10 or might it not affect the patent in a patent action? 11 MS. WEBRE: No, Your Honor, it would not. 12 It would not affect the patent office, either, as a 13 matter of res judicata or as a matter of issue 14 preclusion -- non-mutual issue preclusion or as a matter 15 of jurisprudential precedent, for a couple of reasons. 16 One is that, as a starting point, the -- the 17 question of attorney misconduct can affect the issuance 18 of a patent before the patent office, but that would 19 happen not in the context of a legal malpractice claim, 20 but in the context of the actual prosecution of the 21 patent before the PTO itself. 22 So the PTO would have made a -- its own 23 determination and granted or not granted limited 24 sanction, whatever action it is the PTO takes in -25 before -- in a proceeding before itself, the PTO would
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 be deciding that. 
 2 So a legal malpractice case would only be 
 3 subsequent to that. So, in -- in the first instance, 
 4 the PTO gets to decide that. 
 5 From a res judicata standpoint, the PTO's 6 patent review manual -- the Manual of Examination of 7 Patents provides that res judicata effect is only given 8 to decisions by either the Board of Patent Review or 9 Interferences, the United States District Court for the 10 District of Columbia, and the Federal circuit. No State 11 courts make that list. 12 So, from a res judicata standpoint, only 13 going right up the chain is going to bind the PTO. And, 14 from an issue preclusion standpoint, the PTO would never 15 be a party -- could never be a party to a -- a legal 16 malpractice claim and, therefore, would not be bound by 17 any State court decision. 18 And what's kind of a funny -19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I find that somewhat 20 hard to follow. 21 Let's assume, in adjudicating a medical -- a 22 malpractice claim, the State court finds that the 23 attorney suppressed information. It's a finding of 24 fact. He had this information in his or her file, and 25 they didn't disclose it. I'm not quite sure how the PTO
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 ignores that litigation. 2 MS. WEBRE: The PTO may not ignore it. The 3 PTO -4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or the district court 5 doesn't, if it gets to review that in a later action. 6 MS. WEBRE: Well, but -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm only raising this 8 question to address Justice Scalia's point. You're 9 asking for an absolute rule, and I posited a situation 10 where I think it's not so clear that a State court 11 finding might not have an effect. 12 So do we have to go to your absolute rule? 13 MS. WEBRE: No, Your Honor. You do not have 14 to go to my absolute rule. I think that the absolute 15 rule is the -- the most sensible and appropriate 16 application of the Grable test to State law legal 17 malpractice claims, and it has the added benefit of 18 certainty. It -- it doesn't roll us back to the Justice 19 Holmes' rule. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess you might argue 21 that, even if it fails the Grable test in a couple of 22 isolated cases, we should still adopt that rule because 23 the benefits of having a -- a clear rule that doesn't 24 have to be litigated in every -- every case outweigh the 25 fact that one or two might -- might not come out that
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 way if we applied Grable. 2 MS. WEBRE: Well -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because we're making it up 4 anyway, right? 5 (Laughter.) 6 MS. WEBRE: Well, Your Honor, I -- I would 7 take it a step further than that because I think that 8 any actual impact of -- of what you're positing, Justice 9 Sotomayor, is so ephemeral. The idea that -- that the 10 PTO will look at a fact-finding in a legal malpractice 11 case, and, oh, goodness, I didn't realize there was this 12 suppression of evidence, I'm now going to dig further. 13 Well, that's such a speculative and 14 ephemeral possibility, it doesn't disrupt the fabric of 15 patent jurisprudence -- patent law, in any way, and it 16 doesn't tie the hands of the PTO in any way. It doesn't 17 bind the PTO in any future consideration of a 18 continuation patent or any other related 19 continuation-in-part patent. 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let me ask you 21 this: The Brighton Miller treatise is rather 22 complimentary of Grable, it says it brought 23 considerable certainty to the area. I was pleased to 24 hear that because I'm not sure that it's true. 25 (Laughter.)

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But can you just tell me, as an -- as an 2 empirical matter, does "arising under" 3 for removal jurisdiction cases consume a tremendous 4 amount of time in litigation in the Federal courts? 5 It's just -6 MS. WEBRE: Well, it -- it does a couple of 7 things. First is it consumes a lot of time of the 8 courts and the litigants in removing and then getting 9 remanded again. And it -- as is discussed in the -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What I -- yes. What I 11 mean is the argument over "arising under" over 12 jurisdiction. 13 MS. WEBRE: There are, on this issue of the 14 legal malpractice cases, in the wake of the Federal 15 circuit's opinions, the Air Measurement case and 16 Immunocept case in 2007, scores and scores and scores of 17 courts -- State and Federal courts have been grappling 18 with this precise jurisdictional issue. 19 I think this case is about the fifth or 20 sixth cert petition that came up to this Court on this 21 jurisdictional question. I think there are three or 22 four behind us in queue, and there -- there continues to 23 be uncertainty in the lower courts on this precise 24 issue. 25 And -- and it really presents for this Court
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 a question of is "arising under" jurisdiction truly a 2 lenient standard, as the Federal court has articulated? 3 Now, it's true that the -- the entire body 4 of State law legal malpractice cases arising out of 5 patent representation is not going to overwhelm the 6 Federal court. It's not going to -- to -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So my question was even 8 broader. Let's say we resolve legal malpractice. 9 Then -- then we will have products liability with a 10 particular product, and then we will have some food and 11 agriculture cases. It goes on and on. 12 MS. WEBRE: Well, I think that is a -- that 13 is a -- that's a substantial issue. But, like 14 Justice Scalia said, that -- you know, the -- this Court 15 departed from Justice Holmes' construct some years ago. 16 But I think that there is the opportunity in this case 17 to provide a great deal of certainty, to provide 18 absolute certainty vis-à-vis legal malpractice cases 19 because of their unique hypothetical aspect. The 20 consequence of the judgment affects no rights. 21 But, second, in reaffirming -22 rearticulating the Grable test, emphasizing the 23 importance and the separateness of the substantiality 24 inquiry, emphasizing the importance of the federalism 25 aspect, this Court has a great opportunity to resolve a
23

1 lot of uncertainty. 2 And, if there are no further questions, I 3 would like to reserve the -- the remainder of my time. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 5 Mr. Michel? 6 Is that correct, "Michel"? 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. MICHEL 8 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 9 MR. MICHEL: It is, Your Honor. Thank you. 10 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the 11 Court: 12 This case is about whether a State court has 13 subject matter jurisdiction over a State law patent 14 malpractice claim that rests entirely on an issue of 15 patent law that is only heard in Federal court, and when 16 that issue is dispositive, central to the case, has 17 issues of first impression in them, has no State 18 analogue in any other area of the law, and whether in 19 the deciding issues of questions of law and will not 20 disturb the balance between State and Federal judicial 21 responsibility. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about other areas of 23 exclusive Federal jurisdiction, where the claim, if you 24 are stating it initially, would have to go into Federal 25 court and not State court, say, an antitrust claim, a
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 copyright claim? 2 Is -- is what you're saying about patents, 3 does that go for every area, where initial jurisdiction 4 is exclusively in the Federal court? 5 MR. MICHEL: No, Your Honor. It does not. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then what's the 7 difference between, say, antitrust and patent? 8 MR. MICHEL: There -- there are many 9 differences, Your Honor. First, antitrust has -- has a 10 State analogue. The Texas Supreme Court in 11 Coca-Cola v. Harmer, 218 Southwest -12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then take immigration 13 law. 14 MR. MICHEL: Yes. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Don't get in the weeds. 16 Take immigration law. 17 MR. MICHEL: Yes. Now, once again, the 18 issues -- immigration law may be a -- a differing area 19 where there is exclusive Federal court jurisdiction in 20 that area, possibly. But, once again, the analysis and 21 the application in immigration law, from a malpractice 22 case, may give rise in that area. 23 However -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I guess I just 25 don't understand this. Is it the case that there is

1 "arising under" jurisdiction only when the Federal cause 2 of action presented is one over which Federal courts 3 have exclusive jurisdiction? 4 MR. MICHEL: That -5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that -- is that the 6 rule? 7 MR. MICHEL: I believe, in part. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, any -- any Federal 9 statute that can be sued upon, both in Federal courts 10 and in State courts, but as to which Federal courts are 11 the dispositive adjudicators, you say that that does not 12 come within this "arising under" rule? 13 MR. MICHEL: Does -- does not come within 14 this Court's doctrinal holdings in Grable and Empire 15 because we have a Federal balancing and State balancing 16 issue. And, as we've articulated, when Congress has 17 articulated -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have a case for 19 that, that says, if a suit could be brought in State 20 court, even though it involves a dispositive Federal 21 question as to which this Court would be the -- you 22 know, the last interpreter, it cannot possibly come 23 within "arising under" jurisdiction? 24 Have you got a case for that. 25 MR. MICHEL: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I don't

1 know if I followed your question. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have a case which 3 says that, when a Federal question is presented in a 4 case over which Federal courts have jurisdiction, but 5 also State courts have jurisdiction, although, needless 6 to say, the Federal courts would be dispositive on the 7 issue, such a case cannot come within the "arising 8 under" jurisdiction? 9 MR. MICHEL: No, I don't think anything that 10 expressly. But the A&T and the -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would find it 12 extraordinary for -- for that to be the rule. 13 MR. MICHEL: Well, you can't isolate it. 14 That rule is more complicated because it is the 15 application of the Grable standard that's the analysis. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But getting back -17 Justice Ginsburg simply made the point, I had thought, 18 that you place a good deal of reliance on the fact that 19 there is exclusive jurisdiction. And her question to me 20 pointed out how far-reaching this case might be because 21 it -- it could involve patents, copyright, all other 22 areas of exclusive jurisdiction. If that is going to be 23 your special rule, it's not so confined as you suggest. 24 That's all that question meant to me. 25 Certainly -- certainly, you -- you could have cases
27

1 where there is concurrent jurisdiction, 1983, in which 2 we'd have the same problem. 3 MR. MICHEL: I think -- I think the factors 4 that go into determining the -- one of the grounds that 5 has been articulated by Grable and the balancing for 6 Merrell Dow is the number of cases that would come into 7 Federal court, and it is a doctrinal decision. It is a 8 doctrinal rule. 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So patent law cases of 10 malpractice are smaller in number than copyright 11 cases -12 MR. MICHEL: Patent law cases -13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR -- immigration, other 14 exclusive jurisdictions, so that's okay to -- to remove, 15 but those others aren't? 16 MR. MICHEL: Those -17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that make a whole 18 lot of sense? 19 MR. MICHEL: That is the articulation in 20 Grable, Your Honor. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how about a 22 different one, the one that's being proposed by your 23 adversary -24 MR. MICHEL: That -25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- which is define

1 "substantial" as to how it affects Federal law, which I 2 think was the bottom line -- or the development of 3 Federal law, the bottom line of Grable. 4 And she says -- you dispute this in your 5 brief -- that it doesn't affect the invalidated patent, 6 that there's no way that a judgment on the malpractice 7 is going to be used in a continuation patent dispute 8 because it's not one of the listed preclusive courts. 9 So how does a ruling affect patent law? 10 MR. MICHEL: Sure. Many -- many ways, Your 11 Honor. 12 First, the test is uniformity, under Grable, 13 the uniformity of patent law -- Federal law, not whether 14 the -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why is -- who's going to 16 follow it? 17 MR. MICHEL: In many situations. For 18 example, she -- she conflates -- Petitioners conflate, 19 res judicata with issue preclusion. That goes back to 20 your earlier question, Justice Sotomayor, and that issue 21 preclusion will have an effect. And as, in fact -22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Issue preclusion applies 23 only to someone who was a party. 24 MR. MICHEL: Correct. That would only apply 25 to the inventor; it would not apply to the PTO. It can
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 only be used against, in this, case Mr. Minton. And, in 2 fact, patent counsel in this case, under the rules of 3 the Federal circuit, under patent law and the Patent 4 Manual, disclosed the State court's rulings in this case 5 to the Patent Office during its continuing patent. The 6 State district court judge made a scope and claim 7 decision. 8 So, Justice Sotomayor, back to your 9 question -10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that, certainly, is 11 not binding. The -- whatever the State -- whatever the 12 State court says, as a matter of patent law, has no 13 binding effect on that question coming into Federal 14 court. 15 MR. MICHEL: It does. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How? 17 MR. MICHEL: Under this Court's decision 18 Marrese v. The Academy of Orthopedic Assertions -19 Surgeons, a State court's decision is entitled to issue 20 preclusion, even in Federal forum. And so that is 21 why -- also the patent -- the continuation patent 22 would -- could be declared invalid for failing to 23 disclose that information. 24 We are not saying it's binding on the PTO, 25 but it is an issue of issue preclusion as against Minton

1 that would be in front of the PTO and is in front of the 2 PTO, as we speak. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, is that -- my 4 goodness, but you are going to have a purely 5 hypothetical State decision here. The State will have 6 held that -- you know, if -- if he had said this, the 7 result would have been something else. And you think 8 that that precludes the -- the issue when it arises in 9 real life? 10 And you say, since the State court made that 11 hypothetical determination, it precludes me from arguing 12 it in -- in real life. 13 MR. MICHEL: Yes. It is a factor -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any cases like 15 that? It seems, to me, a rather weird -- weird 16 situation. I mean, maybe it could, but it -- it's 17 strange. 18 MR. MICHEL: Well, it is a matter of issue 19 preclusion. This Court -- that is the danger of 20 allowing these patent law issues to proceed in State 21 court. 22 This Court -- the State district court in 23 this case entered in a brand-new issue of Federal ­ 24 Petitioners and Respondents totally disagree as to 25 whether this is a fact-specific case or whether this case

1 involves issues of law. And, in fact, we contend it 2 involves issues of first impression. 3 In this case, the State district court made 4 holdings about issues of whether the question of -- the 5 experimental use exception is a question of law or a 6 question of fact. 7 It made the requirement that experimental 8 use had to go to a required claim element, as opposed to 9 a claimed element. It made the determination -- and the 10 Court of Appeals made the legal determination that 11 knowledge of the buyer is conclusive, rather than as a 12 factor. 13 Those are all issues of not only disputed 14 substantial issues of Federal patent law that both 15 parties submitted briefings in the trial court and the 16 court of appeals, 70 pages long, disputing the legal -17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Besides the parties -18 MR.

1 determination? 2 MR. MICHEL: It's going to have a really 3 profound effect on the patent law practitioners who are 4 uniquely situated and work in parcel -- and interlocking 5 with the Patent Law Office. 6 It is the patent lawyers who draft the 7 patents, it is the patent lawyers who present them to 8 the Patent Office, they are the ones who engage when 9 they need to be amended or refined or narrowed or 10 broadened. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: They knew -- they knew 12 these were controverted issues. You say that they -13 they are controverted issues. So they would have been 14 alerted to a problem anyway. And they certainly would 15 not accept a State court determination as authoritative 16 resolution of that problem. 17 MR. MICHEL: The patent -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: The patent attorneys. I 19 mean, you -20 MR. MICHEL: No, the Patent Office will have 21 to take that as guidance because their new taskmaster 22 will not be -- be following Federal patent law because, 23 in this case, the Court injected a brand-new requirement 24 that was never held by a patent lawyer, that you had to 25 have an expert witness testify to establish your

1 experimental use testing exception. 2 That's never been held anywhere in Federal 3 patent law. So, now, who's the patent lawyer going to 4 be looking to for guidance? The exclusive Federal 5 courts? The Patent Office? Guidance from the Federal 6 circuits? 7 No, they are going to have their backs 8 watched by the State courts, saying, uh-huh, you know 9 what? I'm going to impose a new legal obligation on 10 you, and you are going to be held for malpractice. And 11 that's not -- that's not -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would happen -- what 13 would happen if that came up in an ordinary litigation 14 in Federal court, and the Federal circuit, ultimately, 15 decided the question, that the State court was entirely 16 wrong about this; you don't need a witness. 17 Well, that's the end of it, right? Once the 18 Federal court decides the question, then whatever the -19 the State judge thought was the Federal law is -- is 20 gone. 21 MR.

The State 2 courts are not bound by the Federal court's holding? 3 You mean State courts can resolve patent questions, 4 contrary to what the Supreme Court of the United States 5 says the law is? 6 MR. MICHEL: No, not contrary -- that was 7 the point I was going to make -- not contrary to the 8 holdings of the United States Supreme Court, contrary to 9 the Federal circuit's holding. And, in fact, the Fort 10 Worth Court of Appeals did not follow the Federal 11 circuit's holding in this area. 12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, are you saying, 13 Mr. Michel, that what -- what the State courts are going 14 to do is to say that, notwithstanding that the Federal 15 circuit has ruled on a matter and notwithstanding that 16 the lawyer has complied with the rule as articulated by 17 the Federal circuit, that, nonetheless, they will be 18 held to have committed malpractice because they didn't 19 comply with the State's rule? 20 Is -- is that what you think the State 21 judges are really going to do? 22 MR. MICHEL: I think the State judges are 23 going to try to, possibly, apply Federal circuit 24 holding. In this case, they did not. They injected a 25 new holding, which established a new liability for the

The hypothetical doesn't mean -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that worse than the 12 fact that, if it goes to Federal court, all of the 13 lawyers in the State, in all malpractice cases, are 14 going to be, supposedly, bound by the Federal court's 15 holding as to State issues of malpractice? 16 I mean, it seems to me it's Twiddle Dum or 17 Twiddle Dee, whichever court system you go to, you are 18 going to terrorize the lawyers of that State on the 19 basis of an opinion of a court that is not dispositive 20 on those issues. 21 So I don't -- I don't know why -22 MR.

The Federal rules, 5 that's what is so troubling about -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you -- you are trying 7 the malpractice lawsuit -- the State malpractice lawsuit, 8 in Federal court. 9 MR. MICHEL: Correct. But the application 10 and the rules governing it are going to be by Federal 11 law. The rules in this case -- in particular, the 12 substantial issue of the experimental use exception, the 13 only issue we've saved was the -- the experimental use 14 exception. We disagree that just because the State 15 court makes an opinion and a holding, it doesn't have 16 real-world effects. It really does. It's not an 17 advisory opinion. 18 And there needs to be a distinguishment 19 between the side issue the Petitioners are saying -20 they are trying to get you focus on this one micro-issue 21 of whether it will affect an actual patent -- as to 22 whether it will affect patent law. And it will affect 23 patent law, and it will affect the application of patent 24 law. And so what you're going to have is you're going 25 to have two diverging systems.

1 You're going to have -- actually, you will 2 have one on the Federal side, and then you will have 50 3 jurisdictions espousing what they think the law is of 4 patent law and not being bound by the Federal circuit, 5 which is going to -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Anytime -- anytime -- I 7 mean, a lot of patent questions -- as you already 8 pointed out, a lot of patent questions come up in State 9 court litigations, contract litigations, every time you 10 have a patent question, then must the case go to the 11 Federal court, in your view? 12 MR. MICHEL: No, that is not our position. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what is the dividing 14 line between patent questions that belong in State court 15 and patent questions that belong only in Federal court? 16 MR. MICHEL: For example, not every 17 malpractice case -- it will be the case within the case 18 doctrine in a patent case that will go to Federal court. 19 For example, failure to communicate a 20 settlement offer does not have a case within the case. 21 In a business transaction, it doesn't have the case 22 within the case analysis. 23 So those malpractices arising from them will 24 not go to Federal court. Breaches of fiduciary duty for 25 divestiture of fees don't have the causation element.

The only distinguishing factor is this 13 hypothetical argument of the case within the case 14 analysis. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why don't you stay 16 within the lines that you give us? You have said not 17 every patent question that comes up in a State court gets 18 dismissed, just so you can start over in Federal court, 19 what patent questions -- now, let's not talk about breach 20 of fiduciary duty general questions -- what patent 21 questions are properly adjudicated in the State court 22 as part of a lawsuit that -23 MR.

1 mean -- I'm sorry -- brought in State court -- our -2 our request here is following Grable, that what will go 3 to Federal court are legal malpractice cases arising 4 from substantial issues of Federal patent law that have 5 that case within the case analysis. 6 And it's that narrow -- extremely narrow 7 window of cases. This is not, "Katie, bar the door." 8 We ­ we've set forth the empirical numbers. They are 9 going to be microscopic. But what they do have is 10 Grable's test. Every element that Grable articulated, 11 this case meets. 12 It does involve substantial issues of first 13 impression. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what was the 15 substantial Federal matter in Grable? 16 MR. MICHEL: The issue of the IRS, whether 17 personal service had to be given under an IRS -18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. And that was going 19 to control, the actions of the Federal agency, of IRS. 20 MR. MICHEL: Correct. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you have no 22 counterpart for that here? 23 MR. MICHEL: We do have rules that will 24 govern the law on experimental use exception. 25 GINSBURG: You have -- you have --

1 MR. MICHEL: And that would govern the 2 application in Federal court. That's why it should be 3 in Federal court, to govern how the agency -- and 4 whether a patent -- and this suit goes directly -- it 5 affects patents. This is going to patent validity. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- but the 7 Federal court -- you said before that whatever the 8 Federal circuit says, the State doesn't have to follow 9 it the next time there's a case in State court, but the 10 Federal court is certainly not going to follow what the 11 State judge says on experimental use. 12 MR. MICHEL: It does. I will tell you -13 the reason why it does, it's in the doctrine of 14 collateral estoppel. It affects the inventor. It's 15 affecting the inventor in this case. This holding of 16 the State district court and the State court of appeals 17 are now before the Patent Office -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. How does 19 it -- the patent's invalid. 20 MR. MICHEL: I'm sorry? 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The patent's invalid. 22 Nothing the Court does here is going to change that 23 invalidity. That -- that's what I don't understand. 24 MR. MICHEL: Correct. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He's not going to get
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 his patent back from this action. 2 MR. MICHEL: That's correct. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He's going to get money 4 for losing it, maybe. 5 MR. MICHEL: Correct. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how does it affect 7 the patent? 8 MR. MICHEL: There is a pending continuation 9 patent. And -10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We're back to that 11 issue. Okay. 12 MR. MICHEL: Yes, but that is a collateral 13 estoppel issue. Here, let me -- let me give up another 14 scenario because, in a different role, when the patent 15 is not declared invalid and, instead, there is a finding 16 of non-infringement, and that's what gives rise to the 17 legal malpractice case. 18 Then you go to State court, and, in that 19 situation, the determination of -- of infringement will 20 be raised as a basis for legal malpractice against the 21 lawyer in the malpractice action. Then the lawyers 22 raise, as within the case within the case exception, is 23 that, oh, the patent was invalid. 24 So, then, in that situation, a State 25 district court will be rendering an opinion on a live
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 patent, and then that will be binding on the inventor 2 and will affect real live actual patents, and it does 3 affect patents before the Patent Office. 4 Petitioner said we -- it's not an issue of 5 res judicata. They cite a rule. That's not our 6 argument. It's an issue of issue preclusion. It's also 7 the duty and the obligation of the lawyer to disclose 8 that judicial discussion -- discussion to the Patent 9 Office. 10 Otherwise his, continuation patent could be 11 declared invalid for inequitable conduct -- for not 12 disclosing material information. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And your -- your 14 distinction between other areas of Federal jurisdiction 15 where the Federal law controls and patent is what? 16 What -- Justice Sotomayor brought up immigration law -17 MR. MICHEL: Yes. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- copyright law. Why 19 don't they -- why doesn't what you said work the same 20 way in those fields? 21 MR. MICHEL: I think there are -- there are 22 distinctions in the area of patent law versus any other 23 area of the law namely because, as we get to the 24 State -- and this -- this goes to the analysis of the 25 State/Federal balance. That's why the exclusive Federal
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 court jurisdiction. 2 That's why exclusive nationwide jurisdiction 3 in patent law in the Federal circuit is different than 4 any other area of the law. It is that balancing test 5 that we are required to engage in. 6 That's why it's unique from antitrust, 7 trademark, civil rights, securities, employment. Those 8 have concurrent jurisdiction. They may not have an 9 agency involved. 10 For example, bankruptcy initially sounds 11 like it's exclusively Federal court issues, but, when 12 you look underneath the bankruptcy, there is core 13 proceedings, and there's non-core. Non-core are 14 concurrent. Those can be heard in State court. 15 Secondly, those underlying issues in 16 bankruptcy, typically, involve State property right 17 issues anyway. So they are really applying whether 18 somebody has a perfected security interest lien, whether 19 somebody has a justified debt, whether -- things of that 20 nature. 21 So rather than in any other area of law, 22 these other areas, even if they are exclusive in Federal 23 court jurisdiction, some of those underlying issues are 24 basically based on who the party is. 25 And they are still applying underlying
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 State issues. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So your case turns on 3 the -- the Federal circuit having exclusive appellate 4 jurisdiction? 5 MR. MICHEL: That is one of the most 6 defining factors on the State/Federal balance of 7 judicial responsibility. Our understanding of that 8 analysis of the federalism and, also, the articulation 9 of -- just as we have showed up -- Petitioners said a 10 whole ton of cases were going to come in. 11 We supported statistics that the numbers 12 will be very small. But the distinguishing factor 13 because of the balancing test that we are required to -14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, if there's a large 15 Federal interest, I mean, that's what you're saying that 16 there is in the Federal/State balance -- the Federal 17 balance -- it's preponderant on the Federal side. 18 If there is that large Federal interest, is 19 it surprising that the government hasn't come into this 20 case, if there's such a Federal interest to be 21 protected? 22 MR. MICHEL: No, I think the Federal 23 government -- I can't -- I can't speculate to -- for 24 that, Justice Ginsburg. There could be just many 25 reasons why they didn't come in on this case, just like
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 they don't come in on many other cases. 2 But the Federal interest here, in the 3 national uniformity, I think, has been well stated, both 4 by this Court and the Federal circuit. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's a difference 6 between you and your colleague on what "substantial" 7 means. 8 MR. MICHEL: Yes. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And she says it doesn't 10 just mean necessary -- essential in this particular 11 litigation, but, as in the Grable case and the Kansas 12 City Title & Trust, has larger ramifications for many 13 other cases, not just this case and whether there's 14 going to be issue preclusion as to this particular 15 inventor. 16 Those -- I don't see an issue in this case 17 comparable to those. 18 MR. MICHEL: I think there are -- there are 19 a number of issues of -- of greater importance than just 20 this case. The question is the ongoing conflict in 21 Federal patent law on whether the experimental use 22 exception is a question of law or a question of fact. 23 The Federal circuit has gone both ways on 24 that, whether the issue of buyer knowledge is a 25 conclusive factor or whether it is just one of 13
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 factors. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Whether they -- those 3 questions will come to the Federal circuit, and they'll 4 decide it, and then they'll be settled. 5 MR. MICHEL: Well, we would hope they would 6 be settled, but, then, we're going to have this whole 7 other body of law out there in State courts that aren't 8 bound by the Federal court to answer those questions. 9 And those will govern the practice of patent -- patent 10 lawyers. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How likely is that, in 12 practice, that once the Federal circuit weighs in, that 13 the State judges will go their own way? 14 MR. MICHEL: I think it's a very real 15 possibility. We've had -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, my -- my experience 17 is that Federal judges, including this Federal judge, 18 are not interested in -- in getting into the weeds of 19 patent law, and, if -- if they could rely on a decision 20 of the Federal circuit, they would do that just as fast 21 as they can. 22 MR. MICHEL: You -- you would -- you would 23 think so. It doesn't appear to be the case because, in 24 this case, we had holdings that -- that experimental 25 testing had to be on a required claim element. There is
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1 also an issue in this case of whether you had to have an

2 expert witness testify to prove up the experimental use

3 exception, nowhere held in Federal law.

4 The problem is these judges often will have

5 never handled a patent law in their career. This will

6 go to some judges who have been in family law, got

7 elected at the district court, and will never have

8 decided or looked at a patent law case.

9 We're requesting --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would that be the same

11 thing for antitrust, be the same for copyright?

12 MR. MICHEL: But the articulation isn't the

13 same. There are other -- in antitrust, there are State

14 analogs. The -- the judges are familiar with applying

15 it. In fact, the State of Texas, in Coca-Cola v.

16 Harmar, stated that there's a high interest in its own

17 State interest -- I mean, antitrust laws. The same with

18 trademark, trademark is concurrent jurisdiction.

19 The limited area that applies these factors,

20 going back to the balancing test, is extremely narrow.

21 Patent law is unique in that area of almost any other

22 area of law. We think the Texas Supreme Court got this

23 decision right, and we request that the Court follow

24 Grable and apply Grable to the case at hand.

Thank you.

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

1 Ms. Webre, you have four minutes remaining. 2 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JANE WEBRE 3 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Webre, can I ask you 5 about the question presented? 6 The way you presented it to us, it -- it was 7 as though we're -- we're reviewing whether the Federal 8 circuit was right to reject Grable in -- in whatever the 9 names of those opinions are. But. In fact, that's not 10 the situation at all. 11 The Texas Supreme Court here applied Grable, 12 and I think just the way you would want it applied. So 13 your -- your contention is simply they didn't apply it 14 correctly; isn't that right? 15 MS. WEBRE: I disagree, Your Honor. The 16 Texas Supreme Court didn't properly apply Grable. What 17 they applied was the Federal circuit's improper 18 departure from Grable, in two ways. 19 One is they conflated necessity with 20 substantiality, and that comes -- in the Federal 21 circuit's jurisprudence, that comes from a sound bite 22 from the earlier Christiansen case, where the -- the 23 line goes something like, "There is a substantial 24 Federal issue because it is necessary to the parties' 25 claim."

1 And so it conflates necessity with 2 substantiality, and the -- the Texas Supreme Court 3 followed the Federal circuit's construct. They said, 4 we're applying Grable, we're looking at substantiality, 5 but then they did exactly what the Federal circuit did. 6 And ditto with -- with the Federalism 7 balance. They pointed to the needs of the Federal 8 interest in the uniformity of patent law, and that was 9 the end of the inquiry. 10 And I think that that is a measure of the 11 deference that the Supreme Court of Texas -- as other 12 State courts would do, the deference they grant to the 13 Federal circuit in deciding the question of appropriate 14 scope of patent jurisprudence and the relative 15 importance of the -- the uniformity of patent law. 16 And so we arrive to you from the Supreme 17 Court of Texas, but truly presenting the -- the 18 appropriateness of the Federal circuit's redone 19 application of the Grable test. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you answer the one 21 point your adversary raised that -- that gives me 22 pause -- a lot of pause. 23 He says a ruling on patent law of how you 24 should or should not behave in a State malpractice claim 25 will affect all of the lawyers who practice in ­ in
51

1 your State because each of them will have to do or not 2 do whatever that malpractice ruling was because that's 3 what the State is going to -- State courts will follow 4 in the future. 5 So it will change those lawyers' behaviors 6 in Federal court. 7 MS. WEBRE: Your Honor, I think that that is 8 such a speculative road to go down. What is it the 9 lawyers are going to do different? A lawyer -10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They are going to 11 present an expert all of the time when they don't need 12 to. 13 MS. WEBRE: They are -- they are going to do 14 some extra work and make an extra belt along with the 15 suspenders that they are required to do. 16 And where is the harm in that? And where is 17 the undermining of -- of the uniformity of patent law if 18 a lawyer in a-- in a real patent case in Federal 19 court -20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you can think of an 21 example where -- not perhaps on the facts of this case, 22 but where a State court's ruling could, in fact, 23 establish a -- a code of behavior that's not just belts 24 and suspenders, that's something else. 25 MS. WEBRE: Your Honor, I think that ­ that
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 spinning out a hypothetical on that would be truly 2 speculative. It's hard to imagine a situation where it 3 would be contrary or intentioned with what -- what the 4 Federal courts would hold, particularly since it's -- I 5 agree with Justice Scalia's construct, that the State 6 courts are going to try to apply appropriate Federal 7 law -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about just 9 the -- just the flip side of this case? Let's suppose 10 they said, the one -- no, you don't need an expert. So 11 it's not belt and suspenders; it's neither belt nor 12 suspenders. 13 That's going to affect the conduct of the 14 lawyers in the State in the way that would be disruptive 15 of -- of the uniformity of Federal patent law. 16 MS. WEBRE: If an expert is required under 17 Federal jurisprudence, then an expert is required in a 18 real patent case. And if the State court makes the 19 mistake in -- in an occasional case here or there, then 20 a lawyer practicing in a real patent case -- in a real 21 case in Federal court, needs to make sure that they are 22 complying with the requirements. 23 And -- and if you're going to ­ 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, right, the 25 requirements of the Federal law. The question is
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 there's going to be a different interpretation of what 2 that means in the State court and in the Federal 3 circuit. 4 MS. WEBRE: Well, Your Honor, if there is a 5 conflict, then what you're supposed to follow is the 6 jurisprudence of the courts who -- before whom you are 7 practicing. If -- if the Federal circuit or Federal 8 district court has something about patent law, then 9 that's what the lawyers should follow in prosecuting a 10 patent case. 11 And a lawyer who decides, I'm going to 12 disregard the Federal circuit standards on fact 13 question, expert required, whatever it is, and, instead, 14 follow the Fort Worth court of appeals on this issue, I 15 submit that -- that the lawyer does so at his peril, and 16 that doesn't undermine the appropriate uniformity of 17 patent law. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 19 The case is submitted. 20 (Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the 21 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 22 23 24 25
