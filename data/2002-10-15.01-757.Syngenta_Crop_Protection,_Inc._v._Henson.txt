 2 (10:05 a.m.)
 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 now in No. 01-757, Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. v.
 5 Hurley Henson.
 6 Mr. Alsobrook.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY B. ALSOBROOK, JR.
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
 9 MR. ALSOBROOK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 10 please the Court:
 11 In Kikkonen v. Guardian Life, this Court
 12 hypothesized the very situation that we have before you
 13 this morning because here we have a nationwide class
 14 action settlement where the court specifically by judgment
 15 retained jurisdiction to manage the settlement as well as
 16 enforce it. A critical part of that settlement was the
 17 dismissal of this case. However, when class counsel went
 18 to dismiss the case, as the Eleventh Circuit pointed out
 19 and as the district court pointed out, his efforts were
 20 thwarted and the case was not dismissed.
 21 QUESTION: Mr. Alsobrook, I see you've changed
 22 the question presented from the time in your certiorari
 23 petition to your opening brief. And the question
 24 presented, when we granted, referred to 28 U.S.C., section
 25 1441, and now you have dropped your reference to that. 

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Does that mean you're abandoning reliance on 1441 or
 2 simply broadening the question? 
 3 MR. ALSOBROOK: No, sir. We -- we're saying
 4 that under 1441 that because the district court retained
 5 jurisdiction, that that was original jurisdiction to
 6 remove the matter, and that actually, Your Honor, when we
 7 removed this, they -- the majority of circuit courts of
 8 appeals, namely the second, sixth, seventh, and eighth,
 9 had said that the proper vehicle to remove this was the
 10 All Writs Act. And that is what we are claiming today, as
 11 well as 28 U.S.C. 1367 ancillary jurisdiction, and we have
 12 set that out in our brief. 
 13 QUESTION: But you have no right to remove under
 14 1441 because there wasn't complete diversity in the
 15 Louisiana suit. Isn't that right? 
 16 MR. ALSOBROOK: That is correct. 
 17 QUESTION: So you can't rely on 1441 and that's
 18 conceded.
 19 MR. ALSOBROOK: We -- we can -- our reliance on
 20 1441 was based on the fact that the Alabama court retained
 21 original jurisdiction and --
 22 QUESTION: But that's not -- nothing in 41 rests
 23 on that. It has to be a case that would qualify for
 24 original jurisdiction, and you don't have that.
 25 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, Your Honor, but we -- we

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 construed that as being a venue rather than a -- a --
 2 because the Alabama court had original jurisdiction.
 3 And certainly under 1651 --
 4 QUESTION: What did you construe as being venue?
 5 MR. ALSOBROOK: The -- the fact that we had to
 6 take it to a Federal court in the district where the State
 7 court suit lay, and then it was immediately transferred to
 8 the -- to the Alabama court. 
 9 QUESTION: Yes, you -- you can't remove a case
 10 to a Federal court outside of the district in which the
 11 State court sat, is my understanding. 
 12 MR. ALSOBROOK: That's right, Your Honor.
 13 We took -- we took our road map from Agent
 14 Orange Product Liability. There they had a Texas --
 15 QUESTION: Who is they? 
 16 MR. ALSOBROOK: There, there was a --
 17 QUESTION: What court are you talking about?
 18 MR. ALSOBROOK: We're talking about the Second
 19 Circuit.  And --
 20 QUESTION: Initially the Eastern District of New
 21 York, Judge Weinstein's --
 22 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes. 
 23 QUESTION: -- order, which was in no way based
 24 on 1441.  It was based on 1651.
 25 MR. ALSOBROOK: But, Your Honor, also in that

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 case was the case of Ryan, and in Ryan, it was brought by
 2 to class members in the State court in Texas. And it was
 3 removed to the Federal court in Texas and then transferred
 4 to the Eastern District of New York. And that was our
 5 road map for getting this case to -- back to Alabama.
 6 QUESTION: But that was all done under the All
 7 Writs Act or what they thought was the authority granted
 8 by 1651.
 9 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, and we also, Your Honor --
 10 in our removal petition, we pled the All Writs Act, as
 11 well as ancillary jurisdiction under 1367.
 12 QUESTION: Well, what is your theory under the
 13 All Writs Act? Is your theory that removal is itself --
 14 comes under the All Writs Act? 
 15 MR. ALSOBROOK: We contend that -- that in order
 16 for the Court --
 17 QUESTION: Can't you answer the question yes or
 18 no?
 19 MR. ALSOBROOK: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yes.
 20 QUESTION: I thought the All Writs Act required
 21 the existence of some sort of a common law writ like
 22 certiorari or prohibition or injunction or something like
 23 that. There -- there never was a common law writ of
 24 removal. 
 25 MR. ALSOBROOK: That is correct, Your Honor. 

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 But the jurisprudence, particularly the Agent
 2 Orange case --
 3 QUESTION: Well, but can you cite any of our
 4 cases that support you in this respect? 
 5 MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, I can cite the New York
 6 Telephone case where the Court said that -- that removal
 7 was -- not removal, but a writ under the All Writs Act was
 8 -- was proper to avoid the frustration of judgment, and
 9 that was -- that was certainly the situation here.
 10 QUESTION: But -- but that was a different --
 11 that was an existing writ. Here -- here you're saying, in
 12 effect, that removal is -- is itself a writ. And I simply
 13 don't see how the cases support you there.
 14 MR. ALSOBROOK: I agree with that, Your Honor. 
 15 QUESTION: Do you agree that the All Writs Act
 16 is not a source of original jurisdiction? 
 17 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, ma'am. Yes, Your Honor, by
 18 the --
 19 QUESTION: Why -- why then didn't you try to get
 20 an injunction in the district court in Alabama?
 21 MR. ALSOBROOK: There were two reasons, Justice
 22 O'Connor. First is that an injunction would not dismiss
 23 the case. An injunction would enjoin the -- the State
 24 court suit from going forward. 
 25 QUESTION: Yes. 

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ALSOBROOK: And we would have had -- our
 2 client would have had to carry this as a liability on
 3 their books ad infinitum. 
 4 QUESTION: Well, couldn't the injunction have
 5 ordered the party to dismiss the case?
 6 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, they did -- they could,
 7 Your Honor, and --
 8 QUESTION: But then why -- why wouldn't that be
 9 sufficient? 
 10 MR. ALSOBROOK: I suppose it would have been.
 11 QUESTION: But if that's so, then why don't --
 12 why are we trying to read into 1441 language that isn't
 13 there and read requirements out of 1651, requirements that
 14 are there, when there was another way, totally consistent
 15 with the words, the statute, everything else, that you
 16 could have achieved any legitimate objective that you had?
 17 MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, Justice Breyer, at the
 18 time that we did this, as I said earlier, there was -- the
 19 majority of Federal circuit courts said that the proper
 20 vehicle was to remove the case and get it before the court
 21 where -- that had issued the judgment. Today with the
 22 number of class action settlements that are going on,
 23 there must be some kind of way by which a Federal court
 24 who issues a judgment can enforce that judgment across
 25 State lines.

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: There is. Isn't that just in your
 2 answer to Justice O'Connor and Justice Kennedy? You
 3 provided the way. 
 4 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes. 
 5 QUESTION: The -- the only loose end, it seems
 6 to me, that -- that you have left, after your answers to
 7 Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, is the problem you say your
 8 client would have in carrying liability on the books until
 9 the second action was somehow finally terminated. But
 10 isn't the answer to that that once you had gotten either
 11 the injunction or simply the -- the order to the parties
 12 under the retained jurisdiction, you then could have gone
 13 into court in the second suit and said, they cannot
 14 prosecute the suit? It has been enjoined. Therefore,
 15 please dismiss it. Wouldn't you have gotten your
 16 dismissal and wouldn't that have taken the -- the
 17 liability off the book? 
 18 MR. ALSOBROOK: I don't know, Your Honor. 
 19 QUESTION: Well, I -- I guess why wouldn't that
 20 have been the appropriate course? 
 21 MR. ALSOBROOK: I -- I presume that the State
 22 court under those circumstances would dismiss it, but we
 23 don't know that as a matter of fact.
 24 QUESTION: I -- I was thinking about different
 25 writs, and you've researched this more thoroughly than I,

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 I suspect. I thought the closest thing here was a writ of
 2 certiorari. This is like a writ of certiorari, but a writ
 3 of certiorari is from a superior court to an inferior
 4 court. And I -- I don't think that's the way we treat
 5 State courts and Federal courts. 
 6 MR. ALSOBROOK: That is correct, Your Honor. 
 7 And another reason --
 8 QUESTION: And -- and -- which -- and so that
 9 the absence of that kind of -- of writ indicates to me
 10 that the safer course, the more prudent course is to rely
 11 on the standard equitable remedies such as injunction that
 12 we've been discussing. 
 13 MR. ALSOBROOK: That is correct, Your Honor. 
 14 QUESTION: Except that a lot of other lawyers
 15 had -- had relied on the course that you relied on.
 16 MR. ALSOBROOK: That's correct, and a lot of --
 17 QUESTION: You were following what had been a
 18 successful course in the past. 
 19 MR. ALSOBROOK: And not only that, a lot of
 20 judges. 
 21 QUESTION: Well, to be sure. 
 22 MR. ALSOBROOK: And so there were a plethora of
 23 district court cases that allowed the removal under the
 24 All Writs Act and took jurisdiction where they had
 25 jurisdiction originally under the cases of NAACP, under

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the Agent Orange case, and the Sixth and Seventh Circuit
 2 cases. 
 3 QUESTION: Were there any cases under the
 4 relitigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act that
 5 used that device, the antisuit injunction, to accomplish
 6 the same thing? 
 7 MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, Your Honor, no. The Tenth
 8 Circuit had ruled that the -- that the All Writs Act could
 9 not be used in this -- in the method that we used it. We
 10 are not unmindful of Rivet v. Regions, but we -- our
 11 situation there -- our situation in this case is much
 12 different --
 13 QUESTION: But that was -- that was a question
 14 of fighting it out in the State court, and it's not the
 15 antisuit injunction that we're discussing now. Rivet said
 16 it's an -- preclusion is an affirmative defense. You can
 17 raise it in the State court that prior Federal litigation
 18 precludes this case. 
 19 The other way to go is to ask the court that
 20 entered the judgment, the class action judgment, the
 21 nationwide class action, to enjoin the party who was
 22 supposed to have settled the claim from proceeding in the
 23 -- in the original case when part of the bargain was to
 24 dismiss it. So I -- I'm just curious why you didn't
 25 attempt that route.

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ALSOBROOK: We didn't attempt that, Your
 2 Honor, because the majority of the circuits at the time
 3 approved the All Writs Act as the vehicle with which to
 4 remove the case and to get it back before the district
 5 court. 
 6 Additionally, we felt that it -- State courts
 7 have cases removed all the time to Federal court. And we
 8 thought it would be less onerous to the State court judge
 9 to have it removed rather than being enjoined by a Federal
 10 court.
 11 QUESTION: I don't understand that because right
 12 -- built right into the removal provision is a command
 13 that the State court shall proceed no further. So the
 14 removal petition acts as -- as a -- an injunction against
 15 the State court proceeding further. 
 16 MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, the removal petition --
 17 actually the court loses jurisdiction of it at that time
 18 because they -- it -- it is removed to -- to the Federal
 19 court. And there again, Justice Ginsburg, the -- we felt
 20 that it was less onerous and there was some jurisprudence
 21 or some dicta and some legal writing that indicated that
 22 it would be less onerous to the State court judge to have
 23 it removed rather than have it enjoined.
 24 QUESTION: May I ask this question? Looking at
 25 the language of the All Writs Act, which authorizes all

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 courts established by act of Congress to issue writs
 2 necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective
 3 jurisdictions and so forth. 
 4 Now, in this case, you removed from the Federal
 5 -- to the Federal court in Louisiana in order to protect
 6 the jurisdiction of the Federal court in Alabama.
 7 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir. 
 8 QUESTION: How do you square that with the
 9 language, respective jurisdictions? 
 10 MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, Your Honor, there again we
 11 had to rely on Agent Orange.
 12 QUESTION: You don't rely on the statute,
 13 though.
 14 MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, we relied on the statute
 15 because it says in the aid of their respective
 16 jurisdiction, and --
 17 QUESTION: Don't you think that refers to the
 18 court to which removal would take -- would occur? And
 19 here it's the Louisiana Federal court, not the Alabama
 20 Federal court.
 21 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir, and we -- it was our
 22 position that there -- there respective jurisdiction
 23 related to the Alabama court. That is our position. 
 24 QUESTION: Even though you removed to the
 25 Louisiana court.

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ALSOBROOK: We had to, Your Honor. That --
 2 under 1441, we had no alternative but to remove it. We
 3 couldn't have removed it from the Louisiana court to the
 4 Alabama court because 1441 by venue says that it has to go
 5 to the Federal district court in the -- of the district
 6 where the case lies. 
 7 QUESTION: But 1441 wasn't available to you. So
 8 as long as something new is being created in -- under
 9 1651, why not say that -- that the court that has
 10 jurisdiction over the class action can issue orders to
 11 stop inconsistent litigation? 
 12 MR. ALSOBROOK: That could be done under the
 13 Anti-Injunction Act, Your Honor. There's no doubt about
 14 that. And as -- as --
 15 QUESTION: But do -- as far as -- you're
 16 creating a removal that doesn't exist by statute. So not
 17 -- why not go all the way and say, under the All Writs
 18 Act, we can remove to the -- from the Louisiana State
 19 court to the Alabama court? Why touch base with 1441 when
 20 1441 is inapplicable? 
 21 MR. ALSOBROOK: Because 14 -- we didn't know of
 22 any other vehicle that would allow us to remove it from
 23 Louisiana to Alabama. Even the All Writs Act would not
 24 allow us to remove it across State lines or even out of
 25 the district. Certainly if this case had been brought in

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Mobile, then we wouldn't be here today because the -- the
 2 court in Mobile would have authority to -- to remove it to
 3 that district. But it was brought -- brought across State
 4 lines. And again, we followed the road map that had been
 5 set out for us in Agent Orange.
 6 QUESTION: But you still have problems even if
 7 it were to the Middle District of Alabama, because you
 8 don't have complete diversity in the Louisiana action. 
 9 Therefore, 1441 doesn't apply. You would still have to
 10 use your All Writs Act theory even if the case were
 11 pending -- if the Federal and State court were in the same
 12 State.
 13 MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, Your Honor, we feel that
 14 -- that under -- under the hypothet set out in Kikkonen
 15 that the Alabama court would have had jurisdiction to take
 16 that case.
 17 QUESTION: Mr. Alsobrook, what is -- what is
 18 this writ called? I mean, Lyndon Johnson is -- is once
 19 supposed to have asked somebody in the Justice Department
 20 to get him a writ of fixitatis. 
 21 (Laughter.) 
 22 QUESTION: What -- what is this writ called? A
 23 writ of removal? 
 24 MR. ALSOBROOK: This could be a -- well, there
 25 is no writ for this, Judge -- Justice. There isn't any

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 writ for this. 
 2 QUESTION: Well -- well, then how can you do it
 3 under the All Writs Act? 
 4 MR. ALSOBROOK: Because in other cases, the All
 5 Writs Act has been used to -- to remove cases to avoid a
 6 State court case from thwarting a Federal judgment.
 7 QUESTION: Certiorari I guess is the closest. 
 8 Historically you could have sent certiorari -- a court to
 9 any other court and to any administrative agency. I guess
 10 that would be the closest historically. Would it?
 11 MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, I think Justice Kennedy
 12 brought that up and --
 13 QUESTION: Yes. As we've come to limit it, it's
 14 -- it's higher to lower, but if you go back into history,
 15 it wasn't, I don't think. I mean, has it come down to
 16 saying, look, you were in a situation where you thought
 17 that the signer of the stipulation was flat out violating
 18 it, and you didn't know what to do, so you read the
 19 precedent, and there was precedent that suggested, under
 20 the lower court precedent, that this was the right thing
 21 to do. So you did it. 
 22 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir. 
 23 QUESTION: Okay. Now, if you turn out to be
 24 wrong, what should we do next, assuming you're right about
 25 the stipulation? They just flat-out wouldn't follow it.

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 And -- and suppose you were wrong about the route. Have
 2 you any suggestion for us as to what to do? Do we -- I
 3 guess we'd have to dismiss -- order this case dismissed
 4 without prejudice to your going to the Alabama court and
 5 -- and asking them to enjoin? Or what is your suggestion
 6 about what we should do --
 7 MR. ALSOBROOK: Well --
 8 QUESTION: -- if you're right on the merits of
 9 this thing? 
 10 MR. ALSOBROOK: If we're right on the merits,
 11 Your Honor, what I suggest you should do is reverse the
 12 Eleventh Circuit. 
 13 QUESTION: I don't mean the merits of the
 14 procedural issue. Suppose that you're wrong about that,
 15 hypothetically, but you're right about your basic
 16 instinct, that they signed a piece of paper saying, we
 17 promise to dismiss this case in the State court and then
 18 they didn't. They just didn't do it. That was your view
 19 of this. Right? 
 20 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir. 
 21 QUESTION: All right. So have you any
 22 suggestion for us about how we might help you achieve that
 23 ultimate objective, and by us, I don't mean this Court
 24 particularly. I mean the law. The law should provide a
 25 way that you get that objective if you're right. 

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ALSOBROOK: I would -- the alternative I
 2 would suggest is to remand the matter to the Federal
 3 district court in Mobile with instructions for them to
 4 file an injunction or a contempt proceeding against the
 5 party --
 6 QUESTION: But that would be up to you to -- I
 7 mean, the court doesn't initiate an injunction. You'd
 8 have to ask for it. And I assume you would be free to do
 9 it. If all this Court would decide, if it decided against
 10 you, was that the All Writs Act is not available for this
 11 purpose, that would leave you as though you had never
 12 pursued that route and you could pursue another. 
 13 There's something curious about this case, and
 14 maybe you can -- you can help me understand it. When the
 15 plaintiff's class counsel in Price went into the Louisiana
 16 court and said, Louisiana court, drop that case, dismiss
 17 that case, the defense counsel wasn't there. 
 18 MR. ALSOBROOK: No. 
 19 QUESTION: Why not? 
 20 MR. ALSOBROOK: Your Honor, this is not in the
 21 record but I was that counsel, and I had talked with the
 22 class counsel days before, and he assured me that he would
 23 take care of it and there would be no problem. We didn't
 24 anticipate this happening because the language of the
 25 stipulation of settlement, which the respondent signed,

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 was so specific that we couldn't imagine that the State
 2 court judge would not dismiss it on the motion of class
 3 counsel.
 4 QUESTION: So you were relying on plaintiff's
 5 counsel --
 6 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, ma'am. 
 7 QUESTION: -- to do -- to do that job for you
 8 and felt you didn't need to appear in the State court. 
 9 MR. ALSOBROOK: He actually told us we didn't
 10 have to appear, that he would take care of it.
 11 QUESTION: Mr. Alsobrook, if we disagree with
 12 you and reverse the -- and affirm the Eleventh Circuit, we
 13 would be affirming a decision that says in its conclusion,
 14 we accordingly vacate the district court's order
 15 dismissing Henson and remand with instructions for the
 16 court to remand Henson to Louisiana State court.
 17 We do not, however -- this is part of what it
 18 said -- we do not, however, imply that the district court
 19 may not by injunction force Henson's dismissal. So, you
 20 know, we wouldn't have to say that -- that our decision
 21 here was without prejudice. The decision of the Eleventh
 22 Circuit was said to be without prejudice. So you -- you'd
 23 be able to, as far as the Eleventh Circuit opinion is
 24 concerned, get -- get the injunction. 
 25 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir, but the --

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: I wonder why it wasn't -- wasn't more
 2 efficient for you to seek the injunction instead of coming
 3 up here.
 4 MR. ALSOBROOK: Well --
 5 QUESTION: I guess -- I guess --
 6 MR. ALSOBROOK: -- Justice Scalia --
 7 QUESTION: -- your answer is better to have two
 8 bites at the apple than one. Right? 
 9 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir. And --
 10 QUESTION: Even if you lose here, you can then
 11 seek the injunction. 
 12 MR. ALSOBROOK: And also because the majority of
 13 the circuits have approved the procedures that we followed
 14 in this case. You have the Second Circuit; you have the
 15 Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth. And --
 16 QUESTION: Well, what was the reasoning of those
 17 circuits? 
 18 MR. ALSOBROOK: The reasoning of those circuits
 19 were that they had retained jurisdiction to enforce their
 20 judgments. For example, if you take NAACP II -- rather,
 21 NAACP I, the court remanded the case to the circuit court. 
 22 NAACP II, the court said that because they had retained
 23 jurisdiction in an order, that they could go forward under
 24 the All Writs Act. 
 25 QUESTION: And what -- did they specify what

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 kind of a writ it was they were talking about? 
 2 MR. ALSOBROOK: No, sir. 
 3 QUESTION: I should think that might have made
 4 you a little hesitant to rely.
 5 MR. ALSOBROOK: Well --
 6 QUESTION: It's a good defense to a malpractice
 7 action. 
 8 MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, we had to rely on what the
 9 courts were telling us, Your Honor -- I mean, Mr. Chief
 10 Justice. 
 11 QUESTION: Were those cases in which there were
 12 two -- two different districts involved? 
 13 MR. ALSOBROOK: The Agent Orange case, there
 14 were two different districts, yes. 
 15 QUESTION: But all of them were not, were they?
 16 MR. ALSOBROOK: No. 
 17 QUESTION: Weren't some of them -- yes.
 18 It seems to me it's quite different if you're
 19 remanding to the court where the problem arose than
 20 remanding to a different court.
 21 MR. ALSOBROOK: That's right. 
 22 QUESTION: Yes. Or removing, rather.
 23 MR. ALSOBROOK: That's right. 
 24 QUESTION: Do you wish to save the --
 25 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir.

1 QUESTION: -- remainder of your time for
 2 rebuttal? 
 3 MR. ALSOBROOK: Thank you. 
 4 QUESTION: Very well. 
 5 Mr. Bederman.
 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BEDERMAN
 7 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 8 MR. BEDERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 9 please the Court:
 10 The All Writs Act may not be relied upon to
 11 remove an otherwise unremovable case. It is Congress's
 12 province to define the limits of removal, and chief of
 13 these is the requirement of original jurisdiction in
 14 Federal court. 
 15 QUESTION: Mr. Bederman, I just asked your --
 16 your friend to -- to explain why he was up here. Why are
 17 you up here? Because even if you win, the case will --
 18 you know, don't you think that an injunction will issue?
 19 MR. BEDERMAN: Very likely Mr. Alsobrook will
 20 apply, as the Eleventh Circuit invited them to, for an
 21 injunction. Such an injunction could proceed because
 22 under this Court's decision in Parsons Steel, the State
 23 court has yet to issue a conclusive ruling about
 24 preclusive effect. And therefore, they're at liberty to. 
 25 We are, by no means, conceding the -- the substantive

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 merits of the injunction motion whether they would have a
 2 substantial likelihood of success on the merits, but we
 3 would certainly agree that they have the ability to file
 4 an injunction immediately. 
 5 QUESTION: Why -- why -- okay. What -- what is
 6 at issue on the merits? 
 7 MR. BEDERMAN: The issue on the merits would be
 8 presumably the proper construction of the settlement
 9 agreement --
 10 QUESTION: Of the settlement agreement? 
 11 MR. BEDERMAN: That's right. And, of course,
 12 whether an injunction, narrowly tailored to the parties,
 13 would, as -- as the Justices have already indicated, be
 14 properly addressed to the parties to order dismissal of
 15 the case. 
 16 QUESTION: Okay. So you -- you would -- you
 17 would contest the injunction just as you're --
 18 MR. BEDERMAN: We would contest the merits of
 19 the injunction. We would not context the ability of them
 20 to file for the --
 21 QUESTION: You can say in a sentence -- as I
 22 read this, it says, class counsel hereby stipulates that
 23 the related case, including any and all claims, will be
 24 dismissed. And then it defines related case to refer to
 25 Hurley Henson by number in the State of Louisiana.

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BEDERMAN: That's right, Justice Breyer.
 2 QUESTION: So I'm just curious what the defense
 3 would be. 
 4 MR. BEDERMAN: The only defense that -- that I
 5 could imagine is the ambiguity in that provision, as you
 6 were reading, at 38a of the joint appendix, that the
 7 concern about whether including any and all claims,
 8 including without any limitation any claims defined
 9 herein. And what has not been made clear is that there
 10 were subsequent amendments to the stipulation, which made
 11 clear that certain classes of claims were excluded.
 12 QUESTION: Well, I guess that isn't before us
 13 here --
 14 QUESTION: It's not before us. 
 15 QUESTION: -- is it? 
 16 MR. BEDERMAN: Certainly not, Justice O'Connor. 
 17 What's before this Court is what is the proper procedural
 18 mechanism to be used here. 
 19 QUESTION: And several circuits have allowed the
 20 All Writs Act to be used in this fashion, do you think? 
 21 MR. BEDERMAN: In this fashion? Yes, Justice
 22 O'Connor. That clearly this is what I would characterize
 23 as a newfangled procedural device that was launched by the
 24 Second Circuit after the Yonkers and Agent Orange cases;
 25 that it has developed, as I think Mr. Alsobrook fairly

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 characterizes, a momentum of its own in the court of
 2 appeals.
 3 QUESTION: In the Yonkers case, the United
 4 States Government urged the court to take that position,
 5 didn't it? So it wasn't something newfangled that the
 6 court dreamed up on its own when it was the Department of
 7 Justice urging it. 
 8 MR. BEDERMAN: That is true, but my recollection
 9 of -- of the procedural background with the Yonkers case
 10 was that there was some concern about how Judge Sand
 11 drafted the consent decree in that case. He -- as was
 12 later acknowledged, Judge Sand had been perhaps misled by
 13 certain representations made by the Archdiocese of New
 14 York and therefore he did not include a provision that
 15 would allow for a subsequent injunction or -- or a
 16 retention of jurisdiction. That may have led the court in
 17 that circumstance to invoke All Writs Act. 
 18 But there, again, the complete alternative was
 19 an injunction that could have issued in these New York
 20 land use proceedings that were pending in State court. So
 21 even in Yonkers, which presents, I think, analytically a
 22 very different context here, not a preclusion case, not a
 23 case that turns on the construction of an earlier Federal
 24 court judgment or settlement, there was the availability
 25 of injunctive relief. In that case, the Second Circuit

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 bypassed that -- that reasoning and went straight towards
 2 an All Writs Act basis --
 3 QUESTION: But you said you would defend against
 4 injunctive relief on the ground that the settlement was
 5 narrower than --
 6 MR. BEDERMAN: We would defend essentially on
 7 the merits, is that an injunction should not issue because
 8 our construction of -- of the settlement is --
 9 QUESTION: Well, why didn't you seek that
 10 construction from the court that issued -- that -- that
 11 entered the settlement? Why go to another Federal court?
 12 Louisiana doesn't know anything about this case -- instead
 13 of saying, Alabama Federal District Judge, please clarify
 14 the scope of the settlement so that we can either go on
 15 with our case or know that we can't? 
 16 MR. BEDERMAN: We believe that the proper course
 17 is -- in view of the precise enumeration of the -- of the
 18 case in State court, that the proper course was to amend
 19 the petition and seek a resolution.
 20 Mr. Henson and his counsel could have very well
 21 initiated an entirely new case and evaded the terms of --
 22 of the settlement in that fashion. They agreed and
 23 decided that the proper course, the more forthright course
 24 was to seek leave to amend the petition to make clear that
 25 certain claims were dropped by virtue of the earlier

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 settlement, but there were remaining claims in play. And
 2 it was believed that this was the most forthright approach
 3 to -- to use here. 
 4 I would credit, Justice Ginsburg, that it may
 5 have been equally appropriate to go back to the Federal
 6 court, seek a declaratory judgment or some kind of
 7 decision in that fashion. But I believe that this course
 8 was certainly honest and forthright on the part of counsel
 9 below. 
 10 I -- I hardly think it may be necessary to
 11 indicate that the All Writs Act does not confer
 12 jurisdiction under 1441, as was already made clear in
 13 certainly the questioning and certainly in view of
 14 petitioners' discussion. Original jurisdiction has always
 15 been required and has been upheld in countless cases. And
 16 moreover, the All Writs Act textually demands that Federal
 17 courts issue writs, quote, "in aid of their respective
 18 jurisdiction." 
 19 Petitioners' argument essentially would read out
 20 "respective" from that provision in the All Writs Act in
 21 section 1651. Clearly the All Writs Act does not
 22 independently grant original jurisdiction, and this has
 23 been consistently upheld by this Court for nearly 200
 24 years from the McIntire decision in 1813 to as recently as
 25 Clinton v. Goldsmith in 1999. 

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Moreover, issuance of writs under the All Writs
 2 Act is certainly conditioned by the statutory requirement
 3 that such be necessary or appropriate. And as this Court
 4 indicated in Pennsylvania Bureau of Corrections, this is
 5 essentially a threshold requirement for invocation of the
 6 All Writs Act. And in the Goldsmith case, as recently as
 7 3 or 4 years ago, this Court made clear that the All Writs
 8 Act can't be used as a form of cure-all to -- to fix what
 9 would otherwise be the availability of other statutory
 10 mechanisms which are not otherwise complied with.
 11 QUESTION: What would be wrong with the Eleventh
 12 Circuit saying in substance it's the same thing? What
 13 we're trying to do is to stop this litigation from going
 14 forward in Louisiana. So even though the defendants used
 15 the wrong device, we'll treat it as though it had been in
 16 application for an antisuit injunction?. 
 17 MR. BEDERMAN: Well, if -- if, of course, the
 18 Eleventh Circuit had construed petitioners' filings in
 19 that way and -- and had indicated that injunction was the
 20 proper mode and essentially substituted, as they -- as
 21 they seem to invite in their closing lines of their
 22 decision, I think that would be appropriate. But there is
 23 certainly a difference in form and in content between a
 24 removal and a narrowly tailored injunction, and I think
 25 the Eleventh Circuit was correct.

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 And other courts of appeals that have so held
 2 have indicated that there are profound federalism concerns
 3 that are implicated in allowing essentially a common law
 4 writ of removal to be used to evade what is Congress's
 5 role in dictating the mechanism for removal and -- and
 6 patrolling the boundary and the balance of authority
 7 between State courts and Federal courts in this country.
 8 There is, as -- as the Court indicated, no such
 9 thing as a -- as a common law writ of removal. There was
 10 no analogy in English common law at the time of the
 11 founding. The -- a writ of certiorari, as Justice Breyer
 12 indicated, would have been -- could have been potentially
 13 directed, I would agree, to -- to courts. But in no
 14 circumstance was there analogy in English common law for
 15 the court of one sovereign to remove cases from -- from
 16 another sovereign. And unless we delve into a kind of
 17 obscurantist legal history, I think that would be clear. 
 18 But there was, in fact, no analogy for that. And in
 19 truth, there's no such thing as a writ of removal --
 20 QUESTION: Administrative agencies.
 21 MR. BEDERMAN: I presume that in English common
 22 law, to the extent that administrative agencies existed,
 23 the ones I'm aware of, of course, were quite inchoate. 
 24 It's potential that you --
 25 QUESTION: Sewer commissioners, I think is --

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BEDERMAN: That's right. Or -- or sanitary
 2 commissions in London. One might imagine that. 
 3 But again, at issue here is -- is removal, which
 4 this Court has always indicated is a creature of statute
 5 because of the profound federalism concerns. 
 6 And essentially what -- what petitioners would
 7 have this Court do is allow, by use of the All Writs Act
 8 or analogous theories of ancillary enforcement
 9 jurisdiction, to achieve what is otherwise unavailable by
 10 statute. And as this Court clearly said in the
 11 Pennsylvania Bureau of Corrections case, although the All
 12 Writs Act empowers Federal courts to fashion extraordinary
 13 remedies when the need arises, it does not authorize them
 14 to issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory
 15 procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate. 
 16 If I can say just a word or two about ancillary
 17 enforcement jurisdiction, to the extent to which
 18 petitioners appear to be relying on it. This Court has
 19 said very clearly in both Kikkonen, where the Court
 20 indicated that ancillary enforcement jurisdiction may be
 21 used in view of what courts require to perform their
 22 functions, and in Peacock, where the Court made very clear
 23 that ancillary enforcement jurisdiction is a creature of
 24 necessity, there can be no showing of necessity here by
 25 virtue of the availability of alternate mechanisms,

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 whether in the form of an injunction properly issued
 2 against the parties and consistent with the relitigation
 3 exception under the Anti-Injunction Act, or even,
 4 preferably, recourse to State courts to properly rule on
 5 the preclusive effect of earlier Federal court judgments
 6 and settlements, as this Court made clear.
 7 QUESTION: What about contempt? I suppose you
 8 could have been -- your client could have been held in
 9 contempt in that court, couldn't it? I mean, assuming
 10 you're wrong -- that he's right --
 11 MR. BEDERMAN: In the -- in the Federal court. 
 12 And of course, obviously sanctions were imposed below by
 13 the Federal district court, and that's, of course, not --
 14 no longer at issue before this Court, but that court has
 15 that power.
 16 So certainly there are a variety of mechanisms
 17 to ensure compliance with -- with court orders. It is not
 18 respondent's submission to suggest that we take an
 19 important tool out of the toolbox of Federal courts in
 20 order to maintain the dignity and the enforcement of their
 21 judgments. But --
 22 QUESTION: A number of courts that have allowed
 23 the 1651 All Writs removal have said that they thought
 24 that that was less offensive. That was more faithful to
 25 the federalism concern, that -- that issuing an antisuit

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 injunction was more offensive to the State than this
 2 removal device. 
 3 MR. BEDERMAN: I would respectfully disagree
 4 with that characterization. The assumption seems to be
 5 that the injunction would somehow issue to the State
 6 court, and as of course we all know, that would never be
 7 the case. That truly would be offensive. The -- the
 8 injunction would issue to the parties, however, with
 9 instructions to -- to dismiss or an even maybe even more
 10 narrowly tailored instrument.
 11 QUESTION: Well, it may be that a particular
 12 remedy in a particular situation might be less offensive
 13 to federalism, but that's a concern that should be
 14 addressed by Congress, isn't it --
 15 MR. BEDERMAN: Absolutely. 
 16 QUESTION: -- in view of this statute?
 17 MR. BEDERMAN: Absolutely. It is -- if Congress
 18 wishes to address the availability of removal in this
 19 class action context -- and there is pending legislation
 20 today to that effect -- Congress is free to do so. 
 21 QUESTION: And -- and if Congress wants to be
 22 more offensive, it presumably can. 
 23 (Laughter.) 
 24 MR. BEDERMAN: I wouldn't speak to the
 25 propensity of Congress in those circumstances, but they

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 could also amend the Anti-Injunction Act to also change
 2 the balance of power between State courts and Federal
 3 courts. We take no issue with that.
 4 Your Honors, unless there are any further
 5 questions. 
 6 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Bederman. 
 7 Mr. Alsobrook, you have 7 minutes remaining.
 8 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY B. ALSOBROOK, JR.
 9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
 10 MR. ALSOBROOK: Excuse me. Mr. Chief Justice,
 11 and may it please the Court:
 12 I think Justice Breyer was correct when he
 13 pointed out that the stipulation that was entered into is
 14 really not ambiguous. The Eleventh --
 15 QUESTION: That's not -- I don't think that's
 16 before us, Mr. Alsobrook. 
 17 MR. ALSOBROOK: All right. 
 18 QUESTION: I mean, I don't think whether or not
 19 you might be entitled to an injunction, should you seek
 20 one, is -- is presented by the -- your question. 
 21 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir. 
 22 Well, Your Honor, I would say that at the time
 23 that we removed this also we relied on NAACP II, and there
 24 the Court said that if there are two alternatives that --
 25 and they also pointed out a footnote 3 in the Kikkonen

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 case which said that an injunction could be issued where
 2 there are two alternatives that -- that you can choose
 3 between one or the other, and that the -- the 
 4 Anti-Injunction Act does not preclude the remedy under the
 5 All Writs Act.
 6 So we realize that the Court is not a
 7 legislative body and that it has been brought out here
 8 that Congress is the one that can -- can dictate the
 9 jurisdictional bounds of Federal courts. But by the same
 10 token, Your Honor, we have a great number of class action
 11 settlements that are pending in this country that have
 12 been already consummated in this country, and we face a
 13 situation where the settling party who has settled a
 14 national class action must have some kind of remedy to
 15 stop suits in State courts that attempt to thwart that
 16 class action settlement. And so we would ask the Court to
 17 consider that in its -- in its deliberations. 
 18 If there any further questions? 
 19 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Alsobrook. 
 20 MR. ALSOBROOK: Thank you, Your Honor. 
 21 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The case is submitted.
 22 (Whereupon, at 10:43 a.m., the case in the
 23 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
