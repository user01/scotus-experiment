5 Community.

6             Mr. Katsas.

7            ORAL ARGUMENT BY GREGORY G. KATSAS

8               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9             MR. KATSAS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11             The Second Circuit extended civil RICO to

12 claims involving foreign injuries, foreign enterprises,

13 and foreign patterns of racketeering.  Its holding is

14 wrong for two reasons:  First, RICO's private civil

15 cause of action does not provide redress for foreign

16 injuries; and second, RICO's substantive prohibitions do

17 not reach the infiltration and corruption of foreign

18 enterprises.

19             As to the first point, Respondents have now

20 abandoned any allegation of domestic injury.  That is

21 fatal to their case because Section 1964(c), the private

22 right of action in RICO, is limited to domestic

23 injuries.  Two related and mutually 

24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If  if the statute

25 isn't  the statute doesn't say "domestic injury," does

Alderson Reporting Company

1 it?

Official  Subject to Final Review

4

2             MR. KATSAS:  The statute  statute says

3 "injury," Justice Ginsburg, by application of the

4 presumption against extraterritoriality.  Injury is the

5 focus of Section 1964(c), and therefore, injury is

6 limited to domestic application absent a clear

7 indication to the contrary.

8             That is a straightforward application of

9 this Court's decision in Morrison, which says you

10 identify the focus of the provision before you, and you

11 limit it to domestic application unless Congress says

12 otherwise.

13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you're making a

14 distinction between RICO when the government is using it

15 as a prosecutorial tool  tool, and RICO 

16             MR. KATSAS:  Yes.  Yes.  We are making a

17 distinction between Section 1962, which is the

18 underlying criminal prohibition, and Section 1964(c),

19 which is the private civil right of action.  Different

20 provisions and statutes can have different foci, as

21 Morrison itself made clear in separately analyzing

22 Section 30 and Section 10(b) of the '34 Securities Act.

23             And  and here the difference between the

24 substantive prohibition and the private right of action

25 is clear from this Court's private right of action

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 jurisprudence over the last 30 or 40 years which made

5

2 clear that the decision to prohibit certain underlying

3 conduct is fundamentally different from the decision to

4 provide a private right of action for violation of

5 substantive law.

6             That's why Section 1964(c) has a different

7 focus.  You don't automatically assume that because

8 Congress criminalized the conduct, it intended for the

9 private right of action to follow along to the same

10 extent.

11             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Katsas, can I ask a

12 question that  this is an analytical question, not

13 necessarily at all an argument that your result is

14 wrong, but I  I guess I'm confused by what you said

15 now and what you say in the briefs that this is a matter

16 of looking to the focus of the statute, because my

17 understanding of Morrison is that this whole focus

18 inquiry came in at the second step of the analysis.

19             In other words, once the Court had decided

20 that the presumption against extraterritoriality had not

21 been rebutted, then there was an additional argument

22 that had been made like, oh, this really does involve

23 domestic conduct.  And so the Court used this focus test

24 to decide whether it was the domestic conduct or the

25 extraterritorial conduct that was the focus of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
6 1 statute.  But that doesn't seem to answer the question 2 whether the presumption is rebutted at all, and it 3 doesn't seem to answer the question that I think you're 4 trying to get at, and it's an important question, as to 5 whether we look at that presumption question section by 6 section or for the statute as a whole. 7             MR. KATSAS:  I think the  the rule that 8 emerges from Morrison is that what  what has to be 9 domestic is the statutory focus.  Morrison is Section 10 10(b), and there were two choices.  There's the element 11 of deception, and there's the element of the securities 12 transaction.  And it's foreign transaction, domestic 13 deception.  And the Court says no  no clear 14 indication. 15             Congress can obviously provide for or 16 prohibit extraterritorial application if they do that 17 clearly.  If they don't do that clearly and  and the 18 presumption is going to operate, you have to figure out 19 whether the focus of the statute is one element or the 20 other.  And they said the focus is the transaction and, 21 therefore, that is what has to be domestic, and because 22 the transaction in Morrison was foreign, the application 23 of the statute was impermissibly  24             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I  I guess I just would 25 have thought that the question is whether these are
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
7 1 discrete provisions in some way such that a conclusion 2 is to the extraterritoriality of one doesn't really 3 effect  doesn't tell you anything about the 4 extraterritoriality of the other.  And it seems much 5 less important as to what the focus of the statute as a 6 whole is even if, you know, one could  if one could 7 answer that question. 8             MR. KATSAS:  There  there will always be a 9 question  if you have related provisions, there will 10 always be a question of whether the  the focus of one 11 element in a statute carries over to the other. 12             This case on the  on the question of 13 injury, the issue before you is whether Section 1964(c), 14 the private right of action, has its own focus or 15 whether it just travels  16             JUSTICE BREYER:  Excuse me.  Why  why 17 did  look  look at the first example of what Justice 18 Kagan is talking about, Appendix B of the government's 19 brief, 1837 U.S.C. 37(b), jurisdiction over acts of 20 violence against a person at an international airport 21 outside the United States if the offender is found in 22 the United States. 23             Now, that  I can understand why they would 24 make that a crime. 25             MR. KATSAS:  Sure.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why would they put it in

8

2 RICO unless they wanted somebody who was hurt to be able

3 to get damages?

4             MR. KATSAS:  Well, the person  the person

5 who was hurt  as to the injury part 

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  The injury is to somebody

7 at the foreign airport.

8             MR. KATSAS:  The person  the person who

9 suffers injury from violation of that Act can't recover

10 under RICO, because RICO is limited to recovery for

11 business or property.  Pursuant 

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  Look, business is hurt.

13 They blew up an airport in  in Tasmania.  Okay?  So 

14 so I guess that blowing up an airport there could hurt

15 somebody.  But my question is, what was it doing in

16 RICO, if in fact Congress doesn't intend a foreign

17 person hurt to be able to get damages?  It's already a

18 crime.

19             MR. KATSAS:  RICO 

20             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's my  and maybe this

21 is the wrong example.  Think of  they have a list of

22 about 50.

23             MR. KATSAS:  Right.

24             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So some of them, I

25 can ask this question to:  What's it doing in RICO

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 unless they want somebody to get damages?

9

2             MR. KATSAS:  It  there are something on

3 the order of 200 predicate statutes that are in RICO.

4 And the Solicitor General's appendix has  cites about

5 46 of them, which have extraterritorial application.

6 All but seven of those statutes have domestic, as well

7 as extraterritorial application, including the one you

8 just read.

9             When you look at the government's appendix,

10 what many of those statutes do is they take a statute,

11 statute has domestic application, and then there's a

12 provision that extends it extraterritorially.  And

13 what's quoted in the government's brief is the extension

14 for extraterritorial application.

15             So I think what your question goes to is,

16 well, what about the  what about statutes that are

17 exclusively extraterritorial?  There are seven of them.

18 Only  only one of them out of the 200 RICO predicates

19 was specifically mentioned in RICO as one statute that

20 it should apply.

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So your point

22 granted is one word  three words.  Your answer to my

23 question is four words:  It was an accident.   That's

24 the answer.

25             MR. KATSAS:  No.  I'm not saying it was an

Alderson Reporting Company

1 accident.

Official  Subject to Final Review

10

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, then, if it was not

3 an accident  I mean, explain to me the same question.

4 I don't want to repeat the same question five times.

5             MR. KATSAS:  All  all but  the vast

6 majority 

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  Listen, let's look at the

8 ones that were not, that are the seven, or if you want,

9 the three.  Why would a human being  now you've got my

10 question.

11             MR. KATSAS:  Yes.

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why is it in RICO if they

13 don't want damages?

14             MR. KATSAS:  Let's  let's talk about the

15 one that I mentioned.  It's 18 U.S.C. 2260, that that

16 addresses child  child pornography offenses abroad

17 with an intent to import into the United States.

18             That provision has perfectly meaningful

19 application for people who suffer  people who suffer

20 domestic injuries, and for United States enterprises 

21 United States racketeers who could use domestic

22 enterprises to violate that provision.

23             And even if I were wrong about that, Justice

24 Breyer, I don't think you would use the one provision

25 out of 200 as the basis for saying that the  the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 statute that on it  in the heartland of its

11

2 application will do lots and lots and lots of meaningful

3 work when it's applied to domestic injuries.

4             The related point, this isn't just the

5 presumption against extraterritoriality.  We also have

6 the background common law rule that causes of action to

7 redress private injuries are governed by the law of the

8 place of the injury.  Here we have only foreign

9 injuries.  Congress legislates against the background

10 common law rule, and just as the cause of action in RICO

11 picks up background common law rules, approximate cause,

12 so too it picks up this lex loci delicti rule, again

13 absent some clear indication to the contrary.

14             When you look for a clear indication with

15 respect to the question of injury, not only don't you

16 find a clear indication of the contrary, you find in the

17 statutory findings in RICO a  a repeated and specific

18 and exclusive focus on the domestic effects of

19 racketeering.

20             Congress has identified its concern.  It is

21  it is impact on the American economy from

22 racketeering.  Certainly no clear indication to extend

23 the cause of action to foreign harms.

24             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that may have been

25 true, or largely true at the beginning, but how about

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 all these amendments that happened after 9/11 which

12

2 clearly seemed focus on foreign conduct, foreign

3 organization, foreign harm?

4             MR. KATSAS:  There's  there is one

5 amendment that is cited, it's the Patriot Act, which

6 does one thing to RICO.  It expands the list of

7 predicate statutes to include one provision.  It's 2230

8  2332b(g)(5)(B).  It's a reference to that statute.

9 When you go to that statute, it's a list.  The list has

10 60 or so terrorismrelated predicate crimes.  58 of

11 those crimes have domestic application.

12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, possibly they have

13 some domestic application.  But if you ask, but why did

14 Congress pass this amendment at this particular moment

15 in time, what was  I mean, recognizing that it's

16 sometimes hard to figure out what was in people's heads,

17 I mean, don't you think that what was in Congress's

18 heads at that moment in time was foreign terrorist

19 organizations committing terrorist conduct on foreign

20 soil?

21             MR. KATSAS:  We  we don't know for sure.

22 I'll give you another possibility, which is what they

23 had in mind was the September 11 attacks, which were

24 domestic acts of racketeering.  When they incorporated

25 that list that I mentioned, the very first statute on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 that list is destruction of a commercial aircraft.

13

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, this just means 

3             MR. KATSAS:  Which is the very offense 

4             JUSTICE KAGAN:   foreign organizations,

5 even as to that.

6             MR. KATSAS:  I'm sorry?

7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  That at least suggests

8 foreign organizations.

9             MR. KATSAS:  Well, that  that at least

10 explains the incorporation of the  of the predicates

11 relative to the events of September 11, but in any

12 event, with respect, I don't think that's the right

13 question because where the presumption applies, either

14  either on the question of injury, which I've been

15 discussing, or on the question of enterprise versus

16 pattern, again, the rule for Morrison is that you

17 identify the focus and then you need a clear indication

18 in the statute to the contrary.

19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do you deal with

20 Judge Lynch's example?  There's a foreign terrorist

21 organization.  It operates only abroad, but it

22 repeatedly cuts off the heads of U.S. citizens.

23             MR. KATSAS:  That would  that would be 

24 foreign terrorist organization 

25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Operating only abroad but

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 its targets are all U.S. citizens.

14

2             MR. KATSAS:  I think the  the underlying

3 acts would be criminally prosecuted and could be

4 punished very severely.  RICO  if I understand the

5 hypothetical, the organization is foreign.  In our view,

6 RICO doesn't cover that.  Here's  here's why.

7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Either civilly or

8 criminally?

9             MR. KATSAS:  Correct, because now if I'm 

10 I'm turning to Section 1962.  Our position is that the

11 focus is on the enterprise.  And I understand the

12 hypothetical to be a foreign enterprise doing a lot of

13 very bad things.

14             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And doing bad things to

15 U.S. citizens.  It's the example the  the section that

16 makes that a crime is 2332(a)(1).

17             MR. KATSAS:  And  and 2332(a)(1) would be

18 prosecutable by the government.  And the people who did

19 those bad things probably would face the death

20 penalty 

21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it  so you're

22 saying only the act itself you can't superimpose RICO,

23 because there has been a whole pattern of these.

24 They've cut of a hundred heads.

25             MR. KATSAS:  If it's  if it's a foreign

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
15 1 enterprise, that's right, and here's why.   Because you 2  you have to evaluate that hypothetical in the context 3 of RICO.  The hypothetical is designed to make it hard 4 for me to make it seem as though the enterprise is the 5 bad actor. 6             But under Section 1962(c), the enterprise is 7 the victim of the corrupting conduct.  Even in your 8 hypothetical, the enterprise is legally distinct from 9 the person  person is the defendant  the person 10 doing the corrupting.  Moreover, the hypothetical you 11 described, the pattern itself is not actionable under 12 RICO. 13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You  Judge Lynch, in 14 that  in his opinion on the en banc, he said, "Any 15 interpretation that suggests the operatives of a foreign 16 enterprise can't be held accountable under RICO for a 17 pattern of predicate"  "a pattern of predicate crimes 18 that violate Federal statutes"   "Federal statutes 19 that have an express extraterritorial reach would 20 astonish the Congress that made such violations RICO 21 predicates." 22             MR. KATSAS:  Because the focus of 23 Section 1962 is the enterprise, and under Morrison the 24 enterprise has to be domestic, absent a clear indication 25 to the contrary.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
16 1             All of those predicate crimes are addressed 2 by the underlying criminal statutes.  RICO doesn't 3 prohibit the pattern.  What it prohibits is infiltration 4 and corruption of the enterprise. 5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the  6             MR. KATSAS:  Think about  7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, the whole point of 8 RICO is that it does both.  It says "a pattern of 9 conduct," and it links that pattern of conduct to the 10 enterprise.  And it seems to be, you know, a little bit 11 of a fool's errand to decide which the focus is, when  12 when RICO is clearly something that melds the two and 13 says there is a pattern of conduct and it relates in 14 various kinds of ways to an enterprise. 15             MR. KATSAS:  Perhaps, but you could have 16 said the same thing about Morrison, under which you need 17 both deception and a securities transaction in order to 18 have a Section 10(b) violation.  So  19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the fact that some 20 things can be separated doesn't mean that everything can 21 be separated.  And the question is, how is it possible 22 to understand RICO except as something in which these 23 things are intermelded, and at the very least that  24 one is not prior to the other or more important than the 25 other.

17 1             I mean, if we are going by our cases, we've 2 said about a hundred times that it's the predicate acts 3 that are  that are the foundation of RICO. 4             MR. KATSAS:  Congress has  Congress has 5 told you in the statutory findings what they are 6 concerned about.  It is infiltration and corruption of 7 domestic enterprises.  Consistent with that is the 8 structure of Section 1962, three different provisions; 9 in each of them, the enterprise  the enterprise is the 10 victim of the corruption.  It's not the person doing the 11 corrupting. 12             It's particularly obvious with respect to 13 Sections 1962(a) and 1962(b), right?  The racketeer uses 14 proceeds to invest in an enterprise.  Enterprise is the 15 victim.  That's the object of Congress's concern.  Even 16 with regard to 1964(c), the typical case they have in 17 mind is infiltration and corruption of a domestic 18 enterprise, straight out of the findings. 19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you would  you would 20 say  I mean, the  another example doesn't  say the 21  the  the Sicilian Mafia commits a series of violent 22 crimes in the United States that would violate RICO if 23 committed by a New Yorkbased Mafia family.  But  so 24 the New Yorkbased Mafia family, RICO applies. 25 Sicilianbased does the very same act; doesn't apply.

18

2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That is your position,

3 right?

4             MR. KATSAS:  That's right.  The  the

5 concern about the crimes is addressed by other statutes

6 which criminalize the conduct.  When the Sicilian Mafia

7 commits 

8             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And not the pattern.

9 It's just that the statute gets at after the individual

10 instance.  RICO says when you have a pattern, things are

11 a lot tougher for you.

12             MR. KATSAS:  So it says  says when you

13 have a pattern, that impacts an enterprise.

14             And if I could just get on the table the

15 question about the 1964(c) issue with regard to domestic

16 enterprises.  The paradigmatic case that Congress has in

17 mind, the racketeers infiltrate the union, use

18 racketeering proceeds to take it over  that's the

20 bad things, to extort money from its members or

21 whatever.  That's a case in which the union is the

22 vehicle for racketeering, but it's not the racketeer.

23 It is the victim of criminal conduct.  The conducting

24 the affairs of the union in that way is an example of

25 corrupting conduct.

19 1             I'd  I'd like to just get one more thought 2 on the table on the injury point before I sit down, 3 which is this Court's decision in Empagran, where you 4 applied the presumption and related principles of comity 5 to a case involving a  foreign injuries caused by 6 primarily foreign conduct.  And you said it would be so 7 unreasonable to do that as to violate customary 8 international law.  That is exactly what we have here. 9 If you look at the complaint, the underlying conduct 10 that Respondents say injured them are a series of 11 foreign transactions, and you can resolve this case 12 based on Empagran alone if you wish to not write more 13 broadly. 14             I'd like to reserve the balance of my time. 15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 16             Ms. Goldenberg. 17           ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG 18           FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 19                    SUPPORTING VACATUR 20             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 21 it please the Court: 22             I'd like to talk about both the enterprise 23 and the injury points, but I'd like to start with the 24 enterprise point, because Section 1962 most directly 25 affects the government's ability to bring RICO

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 prosecutions and RICO civil actions.

20

2             And as some of those questions have pointed

3 out, there are a number of predicates that are

4 incorporated into RICO, into the definition of

5 racketeering activity, that have extraterritorial

6 applications.  Some of them have solely extraterritorial

7 applications.  And that is a clear indication that RICO

8 itself extends extraterritorially to the extent that the

9 predicates that are alleged in the case do.  And that is

10 true both of the pattern itself, the conduct of the

11 crimes, and also of the enterprise.  And you can see

12 that, if you look at the kinds of predicates that we are

13 talking about here.

14             As was observed earlier, many of them were

15 incorporated into RICO after 9/11.  Many of them

16 involved terrorist conduct.  And the natural way in

17 which the provisions would operate and Congress would

18 have understood this is that they would have swept in

19 activities by foreign enterprises as well as the foreign

20 conduct itself.  We've given a number of examples of

21 those kinds of provisions in our brief:  The killing of

22 the U.S. national abroad, taking U.S. hostages abroad,

23 shooting at aircraft with U.S. citizens abroad with

24 missile systems.

25             There is another example that is, I think, a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 very clear one, that is Section 2339D, which is

21

2 receiving militarytype training from a foreign

3 terrorist organization.  Although I suppose it is

4 possible that somebody could go and receive that

5 training in connection with their activities with a

6 domestic enterprise, the very natural operation of that

7 provision is going to be that they are going to be

8 carrying out the affairs of a foreign enterprise  in

9 fact, a very foreign terrorist organization  that is

10 holding the militarytype training and has those

11 training camps.

12             And so we think that it's clear that the

13 provision has  that Section 1962 has extraterritorial

14 applicability, both with respect to the foreign pattern

15 of conduct and with respect to the enterprise, to the

16 extent that a predicate with extraterritorial

17 applicability is implicated.

18             I've heard Petitioners talk about two

19 reasons why they think that might not be true, both of

20 which I think are incorrect.  One is that the government

21 could just prosecute the underlying crimes themselves

22 and not use RICO, and the other is that  well, in

23 situations in which you have some people in the United

24 States, you could kind of break them off and call them a

25 domestic enterprise.  And I don't think either of those

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 is a workable approach to Section 1962.

22

2             With respect to just prosecuting the

3 underlying crimes, of course the very point of RICO was

4 that Congress thought, where there were patterns of

5 serious crimes, that just prosecuting the crime itself

6 was not a strong enough tool for the government, and

7 that it was important for the government to have these

8 special advantages that RICO confirms in order to root

9 out the things that are causing these patterns of

10 crimes.

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But RICO imposes, it

12 seems to me, as we've even observed in the domestic

13 context, far more significant  the impact

14 internationally could be far more significant than

15 prosecution simply of the underlying offenses.  It

16 obviously provides the government with extremely strong

17 prosecutorial reach and penalties, far beyond what the

18 substantive elements do.  And I'm wondering why that

19 shouldn't cause us to be more concerned with respect to

20 the comity interests that are at stake when you're

21 talking about extraterritorial applicability.

22             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I think, as this

23 Court observed in Empagran, when you're talking about

24 Section 1962 or something like Section 1962, where it is

25 the government that is choosing whether to prosecute or

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
23 1 whether to bring a civil action, the government has the 2 ability, it has the incentive, to take those kinds of 3 concerns into account and to regulate itself, either to 4 be constrained in bringing that kind of action where it 5 might cause some comity concerns, or to deal 6 governmenttogovernment with another government, to try 7 to make sure that those comity concerns are smoothed 8 over.  It's on the private side, under Section 1964(c), 9 where you have private parties bringing treble damages 10 actions, that the concerns about comity, I think, are 11 much greater, because private parties don't have that 12 same ability or incentive to regulate.  When they are 13 bringing actions, they are trying to get their treble 14 damages. 15             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I thought this was 16 the same question, but I'm elaborating a bit because 17 it's both for you and Mr. Frederick's reading. 18             I thought the answer to my first question 19 would be that the government just wanted the forfeiture 20 provisions  that's why it put them in  or the 21 criminal provisions  that's why it put these other 22 things in  and you say, that's right.  You say, but 23 they didn't want the damages to extend abroad.  That's 24 your position. 25             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes.  That's correct.

6             But then they're the EU, and moreover, not

7 only do they tell us that the 27 nations of the EU don't

8 agree with you, but in fact, what's very confusing about

9 this is, in the Alien Tort Statute case  which, after

10 all, involved torture, and not simply money

11 laundering  the EU countries, at least three, were in

12 here with briefs  I think it was Germany, the

13 Netherlands and Britain  saying, stay out of this

14 stuff.  Not completely, but basically.  And you were on

15 the other side.  Okay?  So what's going on?

25             Is it that no one actually spoke to anybody

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
25 1 except the lawyer at the EU, and then the EU never spoke 2 to anybody in any of the relevant Ministries of Justice 3 or Embassy? 4             Is it that you actually went and talked to 5 the ambassadors of England, Germany, the Netherlands and 6 asked them why do you want us to take a different 7 position in this case than  it seems to be  than you 8 took in the other case? 9             I mean, I have a few pages here.  I can't 10 work with a few pages.  I have no idea what the right 11 result is here in one important aspect unless I know 12 what afterthought and consideration you, the State 13 Department, and those other countries, and their 14 ambassadors, et cetera, actually think. 15             Do I have enough here to deal with it?  What 16 do I do? 17             MS.

Did the State Department go out and ask them 22 to have their legal departments over in Germany look up 23 what the actual effect would be of the damages?  Or was 24 it the EU that bore total responsibility for this matter 25 without even consulting from Brussels what happens in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
26 1 Germany or some other place?  I mean, how did it work? 2             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, to my knowledge, we 3 didn't have those consultations, although I understand 4 that the EU informed the Justice Department before it 5 filed the  6             JUSTICE BREYER:  And did it consult with the 7 other three?  You see where I'm going, and I'd like your 8 best answer  9             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I think that this is 10 a very unusual case where you have foreign sovereigns as 11 the private RICO plaintiffs.  I think that won't usually 12 be true.  And the rule that we are coming in here to 13 advance is going to be the rule for the usual case, as 14 well as the unusual case. 15             And so although it may be that, you know, 16 the EU has special views about comity concerns here 17 where it's the plaintiff, in the usual case the 18 plaintiff is going to be a private party, and it's going 19 to be a situation in which the conduct and the injury 20 took place somewhere else.  And the country where that 21 conduct and that injury took place may very well have 22 its own interest in regulating, may not be appreciative 23 of plaintiffs being able to come to the United States to 24 get remedies here, particularly treble damages remedies, 25 which, as this Court pointed out in Empagran, is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
27 1 something that often causes foreign countries a great 2 deal of consternation  3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's  why isn't forum 4 non conveniens the answer to that?  If  if  the 5 question is, where should  who should provide a remedy 6 to this conduct, and if it's  really is centered in 7 that other state, a forum non conveniens motion should 8 be  should be made to dismiss the action, because it's 9 a far more appropriate forum abroad. 10             MS. GOLDENBERG:  This Court suggested in 11 Empagran that going casebycase with this kinds  12 these kinds of comity concerns was too burdensome and 13 too difficult for courts, and it would be better to make 14 a blanket judgment about the comity concerns with 15 respect to the cause of action as a whole.  And here, of 16 course, we're talking not only about what court you're 17 going to be in, but what law is going to apply. 18             The courts in the United States are not 19 being closed to RICO plaintiffs if they can't bring a 20 private claim for treble damages under Section 1964(c). 21 There may be other kinds of claims that they can bring. 22             This is a question about whether, under this 23 particular Federal statute, there is a recovery that's 24  that's permissible.  And  25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms.  please.  Sorry.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, all  I was just

28

2 going to say that in addition to comity concerns, I

3 think there are other things that point in the

4 direction 

5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, then, can I interrupt

6 and talk about your comity concerns, because I

7 understand them.  I mean, they seem very important.  But

8 once you say that the presumption against

9 extraterritorial is rebutted, on both the pattern of

10 racketeering and the enterprise, once you say that, then

11 drawing the line where you draw it seems to be very

12 policyish.  There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of law

13 behind it.  So I want to give you an opportunity to make

14 it as lawlike as you can, drawing the line here.

15             MS. GOLDENBERG:  Sure.  There are a number

16 of things, I think.  One is that just on the face of the

17 provisions, you can see that Section 1964(c) is not

18 coextensive with  with Section 1962.  Congress chose

19 to provide for recovery only for injury to business or

20 property, not for personal injury, even though many of

21 these predicates might be likely to cause personal

22 injury.

23             In addition to that, I think you have the

24 comity concerns, which are an important underpinning of

25 the presumption against extraterritoriality.  And as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 Petitioner's counsel pointed out, you do have this

29

2 background common law rule that the place of injury is

3 going to be the place where  that  that's going to

4 have the law govern whatever injury you're talking about

5 rather than the law of some the other jurisdiction.

11 Justice, and may it please the Court:

12             The European Union and 26 of its Member

13 States brought this case in the United States against a

14 United States corporation for the actions it committed

15 in the United States and from the United States, that

16 had effects in Europe.  This was a completely logical

17 and natural place for this case to be brought 

18             JUSTICE ALITO:  Why is that?  Why is that

19 so, Mr. Frederick?  Isn't it rather strange that

20 countries in Europe, Member States of the European

21 Union, are suing in the courts of the United States for

22 injuries sustained to their business interests in

23 Europe?  Why didn't they just sue in their own courts?

24             MR. FREDERICK:  Well, first, the fact that

25 RJR has no subsidiary in Europe raised a question of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 personal jurisdiction that would have affected the

30

2 enforceability of judgments.  And you had an issue where

3 you had 26 Member States that were being affected, and

4 the logical place for them in working together would be

5 in the United States court.

6             For precisely the reason that when the legal

7 advisor in 1982 testified after this Court's Pfizer

8 decision about the applicability and reciprocity of

9 having foreign countries come to United States courts,

10 the legal advisor testified that the United States had

11 brought cases in over 50 jurisdictions around the world.

12             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well  well, are you saying

13 that the  the law of personal jurisdiction in the 

14 the Member States of the European Union is similar to

15 that in the United States, that they would not  under

16 their laws, they would say they do not have personal

17 jurisdiction over RJR?

18             MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Alito, what I'm

19 saying is that it varies among the Member States.  But

20 what we do know is the defendant, the evidence, the

21 witnesses are here in the United States, and the

22 allegation is that they violated U.S. law.  And it is

23 the same kind of action that the United States has

24 brought in European Member States for many, many

25 years

And  and I  6 it's an area I don't know about.  What will really 7 happen in international relations?  That's their job. 8 And you are representing the EU, which seems to be 9 taking a position somewhat different than it took 10 previously, and I want to know who did you talk to. 11             MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Breyer  12             JUSTICE BREYER:  How  how did it work? 13             MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you for asking me this 14 question.  We presented information to the U.S. 15 officials before the suit was filed, and were told that 16 the U.S. would be neutral as to it. 17             Furthermore, I can tell you that in 20 years 18 of practicing before this Court, this is the single most 19 comprehensively vetted exercise on my brief that I have 20 ever had. 21             EU officials have gone over every single 22 line and compared with the positions taken by Member 23 States in other cases.  And the reason why this isn't 24 important to the EU, and the consistency with which 25 those positions is made, rests on four very important
Alderson Reporting Company

1 principles.

Official  Subject to Final Review

32

2             When Congress extended RICO

3 extraterritorially, there are one of four components

4 that is present in every single one of the 40some

5 statutes that the Solicitor General puts in Appendix B:

6 The victim is an American; the defendant is an American,

7 the perpetrator; there is effect on U.S. interests; or

8 there is conduct that occurs in the United States.

9             Every one of those four components tracks

10 with an important principle of international law.  The

11 extraterritoriality principle, the nationality

12 principle, the passive protective personality principle,

13 and the protective personality.

14             So these issues are things that Congress was

15 considering and was aware of when it made the decision

16 to extend these crimes extraterritorially 

17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if  if 

18             MR. FREDERICK:   it posed a domestic

19 requirement.  Sorry.

21 is a case with mostly foreign conduct and foreign

22 injuries, and if personal jurisdiction and forum non

23 conveniens are satisfied, then these actions could be

24 brought under RICO in foreign courts, correct?

25             MR. FREDERICK:  Sorry.  In foreign courts,

5 would be using the law 

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's say a private person

7 is injured in England can bring a  I take it bring a

8 suit in English court and invoke RICO.

9             MR. FREDERICK:  Not that I'm aware of.

10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why not?

11             MR. FREDERICK:  Because I'm not aware

12 that  that the English courts would apply RICO in this

13 case.  I have no brief to defend, Justice Kennedy, in

14 this respect.

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you're saying it

16 applies extraterritorially.

17             MR. FREDERICK:  No, what  what it does,

18 Justice Kennedy, and this is why it's actually important

19 to go through statute by statute all of the provisions

20 in the Solicitor General's appendix, and we've got a

21 binder that's got every single one of them, and you can

22 ask me about every one.

23             Congress imposed a domestic proof

24 requirement as to every extension of extraterritoriality

25 for those crimes.  The victim had to be an American.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 The defendant had to be an American.  Conduct had to

34

2 occur in the United States or there had to be some

3 important interest of the United States that was at

4 stake.  If those four elements were not required or not

5 part of the statute, then it would not track with the

6 normal international law principles by which nations

7 respect through comity the regulations of conduct

8 emanating from the shores of that country.

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought the victim

10 here was the European Community.

11             MR. FREDERICK:  It is, but the Defendant is

12 an American and conduct was occurring here in the United

13 States.  And if you look at the money laundering

14 statute, Mr. Chief Justice 

15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  I just

20             MR. FREDERICK:  All I'm saying is one of the

21 four.  Here we have two of them.  If you look at the

22 money laundering statute, conduct occurred in the United

23 States and the defendant was in the United States

24 national.  And so international law is satisfied.

25 Comity principles are satisfied.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
35 1             In those cases, like the Alien Tort Statute 2 where you did not have a cause of action that had been 3 drafted by Congress and so, therefore, you did not have 4 a legislative determination of the effect on comity 5 interests internationally, you're left with a situation 6 where you had judgemade law, and this Court, I think 7 appropriately, followed the guidance and advice of 8 foreign nations which said, be careful how far you 9 extend judgemade law. 10             There is a different principle at stake when 11 there is a considered legislative judgment and the 12 limitation on that extraterritorial impact is one that 13 has a very clear tie to the United States. 14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You  you can 15 easily  you can easily envision situations where 16 private parties prosecuting RICO actions for  against 17 European entities might implicate serious comity 18 concerns whether the racketeering enterprise is a 19 Stateowned actor or an  an entity that's strongly 20 supported by the  the government.  And in those 21 situations, how would comity concerns of the foreign 22 government be taken into account in the private treble 23 damages action? 24             MR. FREDERICK:  So it's hard for me to see, 25 based on your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, which of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
36 1 the predicate crimes would be asserted as the underlying 2 pattern of  of racketeering.  I've actually thought of 3 a lot of them. 4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So here we have 5 racketeering  6             MR. FREDERICK:  I haven't found one. 7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah. 8             MR. FREDERICK:  I haven't found one. 9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Here the  you have 10 racketeering activity that goes to the illegal 11 trafficking and cigarettes, right? 12             MR. FREDERICK:  Yes. 13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, I mean, what 14 if  what if  and you have a  domestic crime 15 predicates, what  what if the cigarettes were marketed 16 through, you know, I don't know, an enterprise very 17 important to the government of  you know, some 18 government that sells cigarettes, the  you can imagine 19 other products. 20             In other words, it's  it's  here you 21 have sort of an organized crime enterprise.  But the way 22 the racketeering statute works, and we have a lot of 23 experience with this domestically, it reaches far beyond 24 what you would have thought Congress had in mind when it 25 used the word "racketeering" and certainly involves

37

2             MR. FREDERICK:  But, Mr. Chief Justice, my

3 point is that if you look at each one of the acts that

4 is incorporated and has an extraterritorial component,

5 there is a direct tie to the United States, and the

6 crimes have to be unindictable under Federal or State

7 law.

8             So with respect, I think what you're

9 hypothesizing is a situation that would be a null set,

10 and that's where these crimes are occurring in Europe

11 under European member State laws, and somehow there is

12 going to be a tie in to RICO, that wouldn't be possible

13 under a plain reading of the RICO statute.

14             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because it's only the

15 statute that has the extraterritorial  the

16 extraterritoriality built into them.

17             MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.

18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Most statutes that are 

19 crimes that are punishable under RICO will have  will

20 not have the extraterritorial provision in the

21 underlying statute.

22             MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.  There are

23 roughly threequarters of the statutes that are

24 incorporated into RICO that do not have an

25 extraterritorial effect, and those would not be subject

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 to a RICO case that would have extraterritorial

38

2 consequences.

3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Candidly, is  why is

4 the EU suing here?  Does it have something to do with no

5 one else having a treble damage provision like RICO?

6             MR. FREDERICK:  Actually, treble damages are

7 not at all the reason why this case was brought in the

8 United States.  And, in fact, if you want me to

9 stipulate that we will not accept treble damages, I've

10 been authorized by my clients to say that that is not

11 what we are seeking here.

12             What we are seeking here is a situation

13 where an American company is operating through largely

14 illegal cutouts and middlemen and organized criminal

15 operators in Europe and in the Mediterranean and

16 violating and affecting European enterprises.

17             The complaint in this case, which is very

18 detailed with respect to the introduction of cigarettes

19 made and marketed in the United States are targeted to

20 foreign country audiences, but they are being sold

21 through illegal channels through Panama, through other

22 countries and into Europe through organized crime and

23 drug cartel operators.

24             I have seen the evidence for this.  I have

25 looked at the documents from RJR.  I can tell you this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
39 1 is the most serious misconduct, and it involves very, 2 very serious allegations that have been proved by the 3 internal documents of the company itself. 4             JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't it  isn't it strange 5 for a government to choose to sue in the courts of 6 another country? 7             MR. FREDERICK:  Well, in fact  8             JUSTICE ALITO:  Unless there is something to 9 your personal jurisdiction point, and I really  my 10 understanding of  of the law of a lot of the European 11 countries is that they have a very broad understanding 12 of personal jurisdiction.  But putting  putting that 13 aside, it would seem very strange to choose to sue in 14 the courts of another country. 15             MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Alito, if  if the 16 European nations know that they are eventually going to 17 have to come to the United States to enforce the 18 judgment and there is no  there are no assets to 19 attach in Europe by RJR, because it doesn't have 20 subsidiaries there, the simplest thing to do would be a 21 onestep process. 22             This suit was filed almost 16 years ago, 15, 23 16 years ago and we are still at the motion to dismiss 24 stage.  You can imagine that from the perspective of 25 litigation efficiency coming into the home forum of the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
40 1 defendant and saying, we believe you are violating U.S. 2 law and we seek redress for that, that is perfectly 3 appropriate. 4             If I could turn to the injury question, the 5 RICO statute incorporated language of the Clayton Act 6 which, before 1970, had been construed to permit foreign 7 plaintiffs to come into the United States and obtain 8 foreign damages as a result of U.S. violations by the 9 company in the United States. 10             The Continental Ore case, which was decided 11 by this Court in 1962, is directly on point.  That case 12 holds that injury suffered by Canadian entities could 13 come in and come into the United States and get damages 14 as a result of the violation of the Clayton Act. 15             In Pfizer, the government of India, coupled 16 with governments in Iran and the Philippines, came to 17 the United States and alleged that Pfizer owned  18             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm  just a moment.  I 19 know this.  You're absolutely right on that.  The  the 20 question that  can you, when  when you sue  the EU 21 sues, A, an American company.  Now, it's been in league 22 with six foreign countries, and they have agreements. 23 And what the crime is, is money laundering, and the 24 money laundering took place in Belgium, and you win. 25 Now, can you go to Belgium and get the damages?  You

2             There are six Belgium banks.  They are not

3 accused.  They are unindicted coconspirators.

4 And under this  does this statute allow a  the EU to

5 come to Philadelphia, find RJR, accuse them of money

6 laundering with unindicted coconspirators in Brussels,

7 get damages, and then go to Brussels and collect them

8 from the other banks?

9             MR. FREDERICK:  I  I would assume that the

10 Belgium courts  and I'm not going to profess to be an

11 expert on the enforceability of judgments in Belgium,

12 Justice Breyer, and so I give you that answer.

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  But do they get a judgment

14 against the foreign bank?

15             MR. FREDERICK:  To get a  well, presuming

16 that there was personal jurisdiction in the United

17 States, assume 

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  The EU  the jurisdiction

19 only against RJR unindicted coconspirators or helpers,

20 whatever.

21             MR. FREDERICK:  I  I don't know the answer

22 to your question.

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  I think they are worried

24 about something like this.  I think that's what the

25 State Department is worried about.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
42 1             MR. FREDERICK:  Here is the answer, though.
 2 The answer is that if those Belgium banks are in a
 3 conspiracy with RJR, it surely cannot be the case that
 4 U.S. law does not cover RJR.
 5             If there is a question about the
 6 enforceability of a judgment against the Belgium banks,
 7 presumably the Belgium banks will make that argument,
 8 and they will claim in Belgium that  that somehow a
 9 suit prosecuted in the United States in which they were
 10 coconspirators is somehow not going to cover their 11 activity. 12             Our point is that it can't be the case 13 where, for centuries, the United States courts have been 14 open to allow foreign plaintiffs to come in alleging 15 injury caused by U.S. actors under U.S. law, that 16 somehow we're going to read the Morrison principle as a 17 way of constricting the available remedies.  Nothing in 18 Morrison suggests that you would do that kind of 19 extraterritorial slicing and dicing, where once you had 20 concluded that the underlying action here was one that 21 observed and respected international norms and went to 22 extraterritorial lengths provided in this case, that 23 there is a tie to the United States.  And whatever 24 remedies are available are available. 25             And after Pfizer, a number of U.S. companies
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
43 1 were concerned about it, and they went to Congress and 2 they asked Congress to restrict it.  And the hearings 3 that we have laid out in our brief  and this is page 4 45, note 11  goes into the legislative history of 5 this.  And the State Department, Justice Breyer, took 6 exactly the opposite position, because the State 7 Department said, reciprocity demands that we be allowed 8 to go into other nations' courts and the availability of 9 our courts for foreign nations to come in for violations 10 of the U.S.  And if you look at footnote 13, which is on 11 page 55, the State Department testified to Congress that 12 the United States had brought more than 50 actions in 13 nations around the world. 14             So the idea about comity is one that, 15 respectfully, is a decision that is made by Congress, 16 and it is not for the executive branch to change its 17 position for the purpose of trying to snuff out a remedy 18 that otherwise would be available to a foreign 19 plaintiff. 20             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr.  Mr. Frederick, 21 I understand that argument with respect to what's the 22 ordinary remedial provision of a statute.  But this is 23 something a little bit more than that, right?  Because 24 this statute also  this provision also includes 25 substantive elements that don't apply except in the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 civil suit for damages.  Isn't that right?

44

2             MR. FREDERICK:  That's true.

3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So why doesn't that make the

4 difference?

5             MR. FREDERICK:  It could.  And, Justice

6 Kagan, if you were to decide that the three verbs that

7 are in 1962(a), (b) and (c), which are influencing,

8 buying, or investing in, had to have a domestic

9 component, we still would satisfy that, because our

10 allegations in the complaint are that RJR from its

11 corporate headquarters in New York and WinstonSalem was

12 engaging in those conducts to effect and corrupt the

13 foreign enterprise, or the domestic enterprise, as was

14 the case with Brown & Williamson.

15             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if we look just at

16 1964(c) and apply the Morrison analysis in a

17 straightforward way, would that analysis work in this

18 way?  There isn't any reference in 1964(c) to

19 extraterritorial application.  And where would be the

20 focus of 1964(c)?  Would it be the injury to business or

21 property?

22             MR. FREDERICK:  So, Justice Alito, I would

23 have two responses.  '64, 1964, incorporates directly

24 1962.  So there is a direct reference to the definition

25 of "racketeering" that has the some 46 predicate acts

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
45 1 that have a clearly textual extraterritorial effect.  So 2 I think that by incorporation, you would interpret it 3 that way. 4             And the second thing is that when Congress 5 used that language in 1964, it was tracking the Clayton 6 Act.  And the Clayton Act had a  a predetermined and 7 preunderstood meaning as to what those words meant. 8             JUSTICE ALITO:  But at that time, RICO would 9 not have an extraterritorial application, would it? 10             MR. FREDERICK:  No.  My position is that the 11  the extraterritorial application has gotten stronger 12 over time, but if you were to adopt the normal canon of 13 construction, which is that when Congress adopts words 14 in a statute, they carry with it the meaning that this 15 Court has given those words.  The same words are in the 16 Clayton Act as they were adopted in 1970, and as Justice 17 Kagan pointed out, the case has only become stronger 18 with the Money Laundering and postPATRIOT Act additions 19 of those predicate acts. 20             But the third answer I would give you, 21 Justice Alito, is that even in Morrison itself, the 22 Court's opinion says once we have found there to be 23 extraterritorial application, it's not for us to be 24 deciding that there are different provisions that 25 shouldn't have that.  And that's essentially the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
46 1 argument that is being made as to take an extension of 2 Morrison beyond where the Court was  3             JUSTICE BREYER:  But there is a problem with 4 the Clayton Act, even at this time.  It's been a 5 nightmare for foreign countries, and there has always 6 been controversy around it.  And there were cases called 7 Tamburlaine and others which, you know, led  led to 8 the kind of thing that the SG has described in his 9 brief.  So the Clayton Act is helpful in one respect, 10 but not helpful in the other respect. 11             MR. FREDERICK:  And my answer is, Congress 12 has addressed some of those concerns in the antitrust 13 area with various amendments that affect  that  that 14 only go to conduct. 15             And classically, what Congress is getting at 16 is conduct, not remedy.  But in the conduct area, what 17 Congress has done in one of the antitrust amendments for 18 the Sherman Act was to say, we are only going to affect 19 foreign conduct if it has a domestic effect, but it is 20 still a focus on conduct and not on remedy.  Congress is 21 very wellequipped to deal with this issue should it 22 proceed that  there to be a concern, but Justice 23 Breyer, I would point out that it would be odd to 24 suppose that Congress is intending to turn the United 25 States into a place where criminal activities could
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 occur from the United States that was affecting our

47

2 closest allies and there was nothing those allies could

3 do about it by going into the United States and trying

4 to vindicate and  and seek redress for those harms.

5 That would be a very, very stark departure from this

6 country's long history of having respect and  and

7 provide a remedy for foreigners who are harmed by

8 actions of the United States and its citizens.

9             If I could just address the  I think I've

10 addressed the Empagran question, because that's the

11 statute that was affected.  And if I could just note

12 that the PATRIOT Act  footnote 10 of our brief points

13 out that thenSenator John Kerry, now Secretary of

14 State, was very conscious of the effect that this would

15 have on foreign nations and foreign litigants.  And when

16 the PATRIOT Act extended certain of these predicate acts

17 into RICO, he stated on the floor  we cited the

18 provision in our brief  the reason for doing that was

19 to give foreign nations that had been affected and who

20 were treaty allies an opportunity to come and seek

21 redress in our courts.

22             The last point is that Mr. Katsas noted the

23 choiceoflaw principle, where there is a foreign injury

24 and there is a decision to apply foreign law, and he

25 says, why shouldn't that apply here?  That only applies

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
48 1 where there is a conflict between the laws that would 2 apply here  we are asserting that there is a U.S. 3 statutory violation by a U.S. company for actions that 4 it committed in part in the United States.  There's no 5 reason to apply a choice of law, because you have a 6 foreign company that is  or foreign interests that are 7 asserting a violation of U.S. domestic law. 8             In every instance where Congress made the 9 decision to apply RICO extraterritorially, it imposed 10 important domestic proof requirements.  That is the 11 limiting principle on which the Court ought to decide 12 this case. 13             Thank you. 14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 15             Mr. Katsas, you have four minutes remaining. 16          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. KATSAS 17               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 18             MR. KATSAS:  Justice Breyer, you asked about 19 government's positions. 20             The United States is the party that has to 21 live with the consequences of your decision one way or 22 the other.  They are telling you here that there is a 23 comity problem with respect  there is no inconsistency 24 with what they said before.  In Empagran, they told you 25 the same thing:  That providing remedies for foreign
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
49 1 injuries caused by largely foreign conduct would be a 2 problem. 3             The EU is here as a party in this case, but 4 take a look at what they said in many other cases where 5 they were in the more detached position:  As an amicus 6 in OBB, in Kiobel, in Sosa, and most importantly, in 7 Empagran itself, which is the case involving foreign 8 injuries caused by largely foreign conduct.  They said 9 in that case there would be a huge comity problem with 10 extending American law. 11             With regard to comity, Justice Kagan, you 12 asked is it  is it too policyish.  It's not because 13 you have all of these background presumptions and 14 principles.  I spoke about the presumption against 15 extraterritoriality and about the common law background 16 rule of lex loci delicti. 17             A third principle is the Charming Betsy 18 canon, that you construe Federal statutes not to violate 19 international law absent a very clear statement to the 20 contrary, and that's what we have here, because Empagran 21 says that applying U.S. law to provide redress for 22 foreign injuries caused by largely foreign conduct would 23 be unreasonable, and therefore, a violation of customary 24 international law. 25             You also ask why draw the line at injury?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 Once you established the underlying, the underlying

50

2 predicate applies extraterritorially.

3             First reason is that the decision to create

4 a private right of action is  is different from the

5 decision to criminalize the conduct.  The money

6 laundering statute applies extraterritorially, but

7 there's no private right of action for people injured by

8 money laundry.

9             The second reason is that Empagran applies

10 that principle to the question of injury, and

11 specifically does so with regard to the very antitrust

12 provisions that were in effect pre1982, in effect when

13 RICO was enacted to say there's this category of cases

14 involving foreign injury where the government can

15 prosecute but the private party cannot bring an action

16 for civil redress.

17             And that's an important distinction

18 precisely because private parties are not constrained by

19 prosecutorial discretion.  It is aggressive to apply

20 American criminal law, but at least the government 

21 the Justice Department has to talk to the State

22 Department and take into account any comity concerns,

23 any problems that particular prosecutions might bring.

24 That is not the case with respect to private plaintiffs.

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Go ahead.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1             MR. KATSAS:  Mr. Frederick said that the

51

2 underlying predicates here track international law.

3 That is true to  in the sense that they are written to

4 be consistent with Section 402 of the third restatement

5 of Foreign Relations, but there is an independent

6 requirement that the application in a particular case

7 must be reasonable under Section 403.  That is the

8 provision that you invoked in Empagran.  That is the

9 position  that is the problem with this case here.

10             Finally, Mr. Frederick said this case

11 involves United States conduct.  Petitioners are four

12 transactions removed from the original problem in

13 Europe, and two transactions removed from the cigarette

14 sales.  All of  all of those involve European

15 transactions.  And Reynolds' alleged conduct involves

16 transactions in Europe, Central and South America.
