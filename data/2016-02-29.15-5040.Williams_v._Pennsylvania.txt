3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 next in Case 155040, Williams v. Pennsylvania.

5  Mr. Lev.

6  ORAL ARGUMENT BY STUART B. LEV

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8  MR. LEV:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10  Due process does not allow a district

11 attorney to make the decision to seek the death penalty

12 against the defendant, and then in the same case become

13 a judge of the conduct of the prosecutor who carried out

14 that decision and obtained that result.

15  In this case, at  when he was district

16 attorney, Chief Justice Castille made a discretionary

17 individualized decision based upon a review of the facts

18 that in his view, death was the appropriate sentence to

19 seek.

20  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does that make a

21 difference, the nature of his decision?  Let's say he

22 had a policy.  He says, I think every case in which a

23 defendant is convicted of first degree murder, that we

24 ought to seek the death penalty and leave it to the

25 jury.  Maybe the jury will agree or not, but I'm going

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
4 1 to seek the death penalty in every case where there's a 2 conviction of first degree murder. 3  Would you have the same recusal problem? 4  MR. LEV:  I think there would be, yes, 5 because that policy itself would be a decision that he 6 makes.  Pennsylvania law gives the district attorney  7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, no, I know that, 8 but it's a categorical decision.  In other words, he 9 doesn't look at the particulars of that case.  He has a 10 policy that he's adopted  you know, whether you think 11 it's a good policy or not  that doesn't depend upon 12 the particular facts, simply on the facts of what the 13 conviction is. 14  MR. LEV:  That would still raise due process 15 concerns, because that policy would have led to a major 16 decision within the adversary process. 17  JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if the case was 18 simply in the office and he had supervisory 19 responsibility over everything that occurs in the 20 office, but it's a big office.  If a question arose, 21 somebody could bring it to him, but there isn't any 22 indication of personal involvement.  Would that be 23 enough? 24  MR. LEV:  Supervisory authority might be 25 enough, depending upon the issue.  When the issue goes
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
5 1 directly towards the conduct of the prosecutions in his 2 office, it implicates the integrity of the office and 3 the reputation of the leadership. 4  JUSTICE ALITO:  You see, the problem  5  MR. LEV:   that narrow circumstance  6  JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  The problem that  7 that is presented by this case is not  is where this 8 constitutional line is going to be drawn.  You want us 9 to get into  get pretty deeply into the issue of a 10 constitutional recusal policy for judges.  So it's 11 really not enough to just say what happened here was 12 bad. 13  Let's assume that  that that is the case. 14 Assume for the sake of argument  I'm not saying one 15 way or the other  but how far does this go?  And 16 that's what I'm  that's what I'm interested in. 17  So supervisory authority would be enough, 18 you said, but it depends on the issue?  Why would it 19 depend on the issue? 20  MR. LEV:  Because the issue is directly 21 related to that supervisory authority. 22  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, what  what is the 23 rule, then, that you're formulating, so that we can 24 answer Justice Alito's questions and similar questions? 25 Recusal is required when, and fill in the blank.
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
6 1  MR. LEV:  When the prosecutor has direct 2 personal involvement in a substantial decision in the 3 case, and the issue before the court reflects upon that 4 decision. 5  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I  I thought that 6 your  your particular position was that a judge cannot 7 sit on any case where, as the district attorney, he 8 signed on to the death penalty. 9  MR. LEV:  That would be, Your Honor, an 10 appropriate decision, an appropriate due process rule 11 for this Court to reach, but it's not a rule you need to 12 reach in this case. 13  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what short of that 14 is?  I thought  I thought critical element is, he was 15 the district attorney, he signed off on the death 16 penalty; some 20 odd years later, he  he's a judge, he 17 cannot sit on that case.  I thought that was your 18 position. 19  MR. LEV:  Our  our case takes that, but 20 also looks at the other circumstances of the case.  That 21 includes the nature of the issue. 22  JUSTICE ALITO:  But that's the  that's the 23 linedrawing problem.  Why does it matter that it's the 24 death penalty?  What if it was not a capital case, but 25 he  he signed the indictment?
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
7 1  MR. LEV:  I think the death penalty only 2 matters for Eighth Amendment purposes.  If it was not a 3 capital case, if he had direct personal participation in 4 the case and faced an issue that was related to that 5 level of participation, that  that involvement that he 6 had, that would still be a due process  7  JUSTICE ALITO:  What if he signed the 8 indictment? 9  MR. LEV:  I'm sorry? 10  JUSTICE ALITO:  He signed the indictment. 11 Let's say the  the former  the thenprosecutor 12 signed the indictment, and there are thousands of 13 indictments in a county like Philadelphia, so  14  MR. LEV:  That  15  JUSTICE ALITO:  That would be enough? 16  MR. LEV:  No.  The signing of the indictment 17 would not enough.  But if his assistants came to him and 18 said we don't know if we have enough evidence to charge 19 this person with this crime, what do you think?  And he 20 said I've reviewed the facts, and there's enough to 21 charge, go ahead.  That would be the direct personal 22 involvement as opposed to the  23  JUSTICE KAGAN:  You're saying that the 24 signature would not be enough because that could be 25 pro forma?  Is that what you're saying?
Alderson Court Reporting

1  MR. LEV:  Yes.

8

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if you had a

3 situation where he was directly involved in a matter

4 that had nothing to do with the issue that came up

5 later?  You know, he  the  the assistant comes in

6 and says we've got a real question here, you know, he

7 wants a third extension of the trial date and should we

8 oppose it or not.  And he thinks about it and says,

9 yeah, let's oppose it.  And then 29 years later, there's

10 an issue about a  you know, a Brady violation.

11  Is he recused from sitting on that Brady

12 violation case?

13  MR. LEV:  If  if the decision he's made

14 was only about some procedural matter that had no

15 substantive relationship to the crime, then that would

16 certainly be a much weaker court.  And in the absence of

17 any other circumstances 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can you give me 

19 can you give me  much weaker?  Can you give me a

20 yesorno on my hypothetical?

21  MR. LEV:  I would say no.  In the absence of

22 any other circumstances, that would not be a due process

23 case.

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under that answer, then,

25 why doesn't the Brady violation problem drop out of the

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
9 1 case?  And that's not an argument for  for  an extra 2 argument for recusal. 3  MR. LEV:  Because I think in this case the 4 Brady violation goes directly to his role in making the 5 decision.  This is a Brady violation about sentencing, 6 and it relates to the decision he made to seek the death 7 penalty.  And in addition, it goes to his essential role 8 as the chief prosecutor. 9  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, he didn't know about 10 the Brady violation.  The Brady violation basically 11 occurred in  in the course of trial. 12  MR. LEV:  He  the  the record  13  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean after they sought 14 the death penalty. 15  MR. LEV:  That  that's correct.  The 16 record doesn't show that he had any personal knowledge 17 of the Brady violation at the time, but  but a 18 substantial Brady violation certainly calls into 19 question the integrity of the office as a whole, and not 20 just the individual  21  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, then, that doesn't 22 follow with the rule that you gave me at the outset. 23 You should recuse yourself when, and now  now you're 24 adding  if there's a question that involves a 25 substantial integrity  a substantial question
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
1 involving the integrity of the office?  So that's an

10

2 added 

3  MR. LEV:  In  in that case 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's an added factor in

5 your analysis?

6  MR. LEV:  No.  I think that in my analysis

7 it's  it's an issue that relates directly to the

8 decision that's being made by the prosecutor 

9  JUSTICE KAGAN:  So I'm  I guess I'm 

10  MR. LEV:   to their personal involvement.

11  JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I'm a little bit

12 unclear as to what you're arguing.  I mean, one rule

13 could be did the judge have some significant involvement

14 in a critical trial decision as a lawyer.  Is that your

15 rule, or are you adding something to that rule?

16  MR. LEV:  That would be, I think, a  a

17 rule consistent with this Court's ruling in Murchison

18 that you can't have  that a fair trial in a free

19 society does not allow the prosecutor who prefers the

20 charges to become the judge of that.  But I don't think

21 that's a rule you necessarily have to reach in this

22 case.  Caperton tells us to look at all of the

23 circumstances of the case.  And that's what I'm

24 suggesting we do here:  We look at all of the

25 circumstances.  And 

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
11 1  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I  I still don't see how 2 the Brady violation fits into the formula you want us to 3 adopt, unless you're amending it to say anything that 4 involves the integrity of the office while you were the 5 head of the office. 6  MR. LEV:  I think more importantly, Justice 7 Kennedy, that the Brady violation fits in because that 8 is how the trial prosecutor carried out the decision 9 that Chief Justice Castille had made.  And so her 10 conduct in carrying out that decision has a direct 11 relationship to the issue itself. 12  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We don't have a Brady 13 issue before us.  The only issue is the recusal, right? 14  MR. LEV:  That's correct. 15  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So we don't have  the 16 merits of the Brady issue are not in the case.  But even 17 the question that you're raising, you have prior 18 opportunities to do that.  You didn't raise it when 19 there were prior postconviction applications.  So why 20 aren't you precluding? 21  MR. LEV:  That we didn't raise the recusal 22 issue?  Is that what you're asking me  23  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes. 24  MR. LEV:   Your Honor? 25  In the prior postconviction litigation, we
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
12 1 didn't have the information that we have at this time, 2 and that's the two critical pieces of evidence of 3 information here.  One is the memorandum that authorized 4 the death sentence that showed the kinds of factors 5 District Attorney Castille looked at in making that 6 decision and showed that it was he who made that 7 decision.  We didn't have that before. 8  The second factor would be the fact that it 9 was a Brady issue, and that there had been evidence that 10 had been suppressed and findings by a lower court judge 11 that the prosecutor had done so willfully.  So it was 12 those two factors that were new to the case that caused 13 us to file the recusal motion. 14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There is a concern 15 about sandbagging, though.  I mean, if you do have a 16 case where somebody has that information, I think the 17 best thing to do would be to, you know, put it in a  18 the back drawer, take your chances on  on getting an 19 acquittal.  And if you don't, then you say, aha, the 20 judge could have recused him or herself, and our  our 21 remedy is we get to go back and do it all again. 22  MR. LEV:  I recognize the Court's concern of 23 sandbagging.  It's similar to the concern the Court 24 expressed in Strickland in ineffectiveness cases, that 25 lawyers would  would try to create error so that they
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
13 1 could give a open door or back door to the defendant on 2 appeal.  I think that we've seen that judges across the 3 States have been diligent in protecting against 4 sandbagging. 5  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, Strickland's 6 very different.  I mean, you may think it's pretty 7 unlikely that attorneys are going to deliberately commit 8 error so that they have a later problem.  But it's 9 another thing if you're talking about a fact about the 10 judge's prior involvement. 11  MR. LEV:  I'm not sure I can agree with you, 12 Your Honor, that it's unlikely.  I've had that argument 13 raised many times during the course of my practice.  But 14 even  15  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not against you. 16  MR. LEV:  Not against me. 17  (Laughter.) 18  MR. LEV:  But even if it is unlikely, I 19 think sandbagging, for whatever concern, can be 20 addressed by the lower courts and certainly isn't a 21 reason to narrow or not apply a due process analysis. 22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I guess it's 23 not a case of sandbagging, but it's somehow related in 24 that the information you're talking about would have 25 been information that seriously undermined the defense
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
1 your client was presenting.  In other words, the

14

2 information goes to the nature of a prior relationship.

3 And his whole argument and defense was, I didn't know,

4 you know, who this person was.  I had no contact with

5 him at all.

6  So, you know, in what sense does that  the

7 material that you're complaining about now is the last

8 thing he would want to have come  come out at his

9 trial.

10  MR. LEV:  In at least two different senses,

11 I think.  One is, is if this material were produced

12 before trial.  Before Mr. Williams testified, before he

13 chose what defense he would present, perhaps counsel who

14 only met Mr. Williams the day before trial would have

15 had the opportunity to talk to him about this evidence

16 and  and counsel him and confer with him of what would

17 be appropriate.

18  My second part of the answer would be 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that  well,

20 just so I understand, you're saying the evidence might

21 have been sufficient to persuade him not to lie?

22  MR. LEV:  Might have been sufficient for

23 counsel to be able to develop the  the understanding

24 with the defendant about what facts were important and

25 what wasn't, and what might be a better defense than the

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
15 1 defense this 19yearold  this 19yearold young man 2 with little counseling hoped to present. 3  But  but I would say even more is  is 4 the materiality in this case goes to sentencing.  And 5 there are many examples of capital cases where  in 6 evidence where a defense of not guilty was offered at 7 trial. 8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, am I correct 9 that Mr. Draper, his accomplice, did not come forward 10 until later?  So he didn't know that the accomplice 11 would say that there was a different story to tell at 12 all, correct? 13  MR. LEV:  That's correct.  He did not know 14 that prior. 15  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And he did not know that 16 the sexual abuse could form a very potent defense to a 17 death penalty because there was independent proof of it. 18  MR. LEV:  For sentencing purposes, yes. 19 And  and the  20  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The prosecutor, in fact, 21 told the trial judge that there wasn't any independent 22 evidence of sexual abuse by this man of other people, 23 correct? 24  MR. LEV:  Correct. 25  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And in fact, the records
Alderson Court Reporting

1 show there was.

Official

16

2  MR. LEV:  Correct.

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The independent

4 evidence you're complaining about involved the defendant

5 himself, correct?

6  MR. LEV:  No.  The independent  well, let

7 me step back.  The  the testimony from Marc Draper

8 related to the defendant himself.  The documents that

9 were found within the prosecutor's file related to

10 conduct between the deceased and other young men.

11  JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you do with the fact

12 that Chief Justice Castille was not solely responsible

13 for the decision in this case?  This was a decision by

14 the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.  Now, you say it was

15 structural error.  Suppose that the court had been

16 divided and Chief Justice Castille voted to affirm the

17 decision of the lower court.  Would that decision still

18 be invalid on the ground that he shouldn't have been

19 participating?

20  MR. LEV:  It might be.  There would still be

21 a taint to the decisionmaking process, but perhaps in

22 that one narrow instance where he voted in the

23 defendant's favor anyway.  But even there, we don't

24 know.

25  JUSTICE ALITO:  Doesn't that mean it's not

Alderson Court Reporting

1 structural error?

Official

17

2  MR. LEV:  I don't  I don't think so

3 because even there we don't know what his role within

4 the decisionmaking process.  Perhaps it was a case

5 where he already saw a majority, he had already

6 persuaded a majority of the judges  justices to vote

7 in his favor and so  to vote against it and then he

8 thought his vote was  was a vote that he could make

9 without injecting this issue.  The problem is that 

10  JUSTICE ALITO:  So he might have persuaded a

11 majority to vote to reverse, and then he turned around

12 and he wrote an opinion saying that there should be an

13 affirmance.

14  MR. LEV:  The problem is we don't know what

15 happened within the decisionmaking structure, and we

16 can't know what happened within the decisionmaking

17 structure.  And that's why the rules should be that 

18 that a defendant should be entitled, anyone should be

19 entitled to a panel of appellate judges where there are

20 no judges with bias.

21  JUSTICE ALITO:  If we agree with you,

22 doesn't that lead inevitably to the rule that a majority

23 of the judges on a multijudge panel have the authority

24 to require the recusal of a colleague?

25  MR. LEV:  I  that's an interesting

Alderson Court Reporting

1 question.

Official

18

2  (Laughter.)

3  MR. LEV:  And I think it would depend upon

4 the rules of each court.  I don't think due process

5 requires that there be any kind of review by some

6 greater panel or 

7  JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, wouldn't they 

8 wouldn't that have to be the consequences?  Suppose

9 that  suppose you make a recusal motion.  You want

10 Chief Justice Castille recused, and the other justices

11 on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court say we think that he

12 should be recused, and we're afraid that if we go ahead

13 with this decision with his participation, the decision

14 is going to be subject to attack down the road.  And we

15 can't allow that to happen, so we're going to require

16 him to be recused in order to prevent him from tainting

17 our decisionmaking process or creating at least the

18 appearance that the decisionmaking process is tainted.

19 So that would have to be a consequence of your rule,

20 would it not?

21  MR. LEV:  Not necessarily.  The 

22  JUSTICE ALITO:  They could just take their

23 chances.

24  MR. LEV:  Or the consequence of the rule

25 could be that they informally go to the justice.

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
19 1  JUSTICE ALITO:  And he says, no, I disagree 2 with you. 3  MR. LEV:  If  if the rule in the State 4 court  if the rule of the court is that the ultimate 5 decision lies with the justice, then that's the rule. 6 And they  and they take the chances because that's the 7 rule that the courts adopted, and that's a perfectly 8 appropriate and fine rule. 9  JUSTICE KAGAN:  There's something  10  JUSTICE BREYER:  What's awfully difficult in 11 this case is not your case for me.  It's not your case. 12 It's the hundreds  or not hundreds  but look at all 13 the briefs filed.  There  there are disqualification 14 rules all over the law, and suddenly to turn this into a 15 constitutional matter as we did in Caperton, which we 16 did with our eyes open, we don't know what we're getting 17 into.  I mean, there are congressmen who can become 18 judges who voted on statutes that come before them, as 19 Justice Black did.  There are executive branch officials 20 who decide all kinds of things, and later on, something 21 with their name signed on it comes up.  When does the 22 Constitution require it or not?  So that's why I think 23 you're getting these questions. 24  My question is:  Is there a way of avoiding 25 this?  And  and the  the thing that is suggested
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
1 by  by the other side is that you did ask for

20

2 reconsideration.  Reconsideration would have taken place

3 without the chief justice because he had retired.

4 Reconsideration can be pretty perfunctory, or it might

5 be serious and thorough.

6  Is there anything  is there a way for us

7 to send this back and say, you said you reconsidered it;

8 we're not certain what that reconsideration consists of;

9 reconsider it.

10  (Laughter.)

11  JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, is there a way to

12 do that, and what do you think of that?  That's what

13 they're suggesting.

14  MR. LEV:  Let  there's a lot of  of

15 questions that fit in there.  So let me try to start.

16  The  in my view, the Pennsylvania Supreme

17 Court did not reconsider this case because they denied

18 the motion for reconsideration.  Had they granted the

19 motion for reconsideration and then said we'll take

20 another look at this without Chief Justice Castille,

21 that's the remedy that we 

22  JUSTICE BREYER:  Can we tell them to do

23 that?

24  MR. LEV:  Yes.

25  JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
21 1  MR. LEV:  That's the remedy that we're 2 asking for. 3  JUSTICE BREYER:  So  so we could say, 4 given all the facts, of which there are quite a few, and 5 the filing of a motion for reconsideration, and the fact 6 that they may not have done it, go reconsider it, 7 period.  End of  end of opinion.  Can we do that? 8  MR. LEV:  I would simply phrase it slightly 9 differently, and  10  (Laughter.) 11  JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what I was hoping. 12  (Laughter.) 13  MR. LEV:  And  and say what we're not 14 asking for is to reconsider the decision that's already 15 been made.  What we're asking for is to go back into the 16 position before the error was committed and hear the 17 case fresh. 18  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, do they have 19 to hear  20  JUSTICE ALITO:  Can we do that  21  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Excuse me. 22  JUSTICE ALITO:   without holding that 23 there was a dupe  a constitutional violation?  What 24 would be our authority to require them to do it over 25 again?
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
22 1  MR. LEV:  It would have to be because 2 there's a constitutional violation. 3  JUSTICE KAGAN:  There's something 4 unsatisfying about the remedy that you're requesting, 5 right?  Because if the idea is that one judge can affect 6 a whole panel, which seems right to me, but presumably 7 that effect doesn't go away the moment that we send it 8 back and they have to deal with it again, so aren't  9 don't they continue to be tainted in some way? 10  MR. LEV:  You face that same issue in  in 11 the Caperton case and the Lavoie case in  and  and 12 granted the relief of sending it back for a new appeal. 13 That may be there, and it may be that  that the 14 remaining justices who heard the case  and the 15 Pennsylvania Supreme Court is constituted differently, 16 should it go back.  There were three new justices 17 elected this last November and took office in January. 18  So the remaining justices may have to 19 consider whether or not they can put aside the prior 20 proceedings and start from fresh, or whether they're 21 tainted.  And we do that all the time.  Whenever a case 22 is reversed and sent back to a lower court judge, 23 or that judge has to make a decision to look at this 24 case in light of the guidance they've gotten from the 25 higher court, then I trust that the judges will be able

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there's one big

3 difference between, I think, what Justice Breyer was

4 suggesting and I think what you're asking.

5  You wouldn't be satisfied if what the 

6 what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was asked to do was

7 simply to rule, again, on the matter of rehearing.  You

8 want a de novo appellate review; isn't that right?

9  MR. LEV:  That's correct.

10  JUSTICE KAGAN:  What is the standard on

11 rehearing?  Is  is  it must be a very different

12 standard, isn't it?

13  MR. LEV:  It's compelling circumstances.

14 And the  the examples that are given in the commentary

15 to the rule are things like a "known and obvious mistake

16 of fact" or "mistake of law."  But it's a narrow remedy,

17 rarely granted, of compelling circumstances.  And that's

18 not what we're asking for.  We're asking for a fresh

19 start.

20  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I  I

21 understand your  the first two of your three points,

22 but I don't understand how the third works.  This is 

23 you're concerned that the  the Chief Justice cited his

24 record with respect to capital cases in campaigning for

25 office.  I  that certainly wouldn't be a  a recusal

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
1 issue without the other two points, right?

24

2  MR. LEV:  That's correct.

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So how does

4 that have anything to do with the argument in this case?

5  MR. LEV:  Our concern for that is that as 

6 as a candidate, Chief Justice Castille was reported to

7 have said on multiple occasions, I sent 45 people to

8 death row.  By saying that, he's taking the personal

9 responsibility for those decisions and for those actions

10 that I think reflect  become an additional

11 circumstance that reflect upon the two other

12 circumstances we've been discussing, his decision making

13 and 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's an evidentiary

15 point for you.  It's not an independent ground for

16 recusal.

17  MR. LEV:  Absolutely.  It's an added weight

18 to the pile.  But by itself, it would not be a due

19 process violation.

20  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What weight, if any, do

21 you think we should give to the current moratorium in

22 Pennsylvania on the death penalty?

23  MR. LEV:  The moratorium is really not

24 particularly relevant to the question that's before the

25 Court, and  and not  weight should not be given to

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
25 1 it.  The moratorium is simply the Governor's action of 2 delaying executions in Pennsylvania. 3  And in  in Pennsylvania, the Governor has 4 no power of  of commutation by himself.  Without 5 having a unanimous recommendation from a Board of 6 Parole, he can't reduce sentencing.  His only power is 7 to grant reprieve in individual cases, and he's done 8 that for Mr. Williams to delay execution pending the 9 receipt of a report from the legislature and possible 10 action for it. 11  JUSTICE ALITO:  When was the last time a 12 prisoner was executed in Pennsylvania, other than those 13 instances in which the prisoner decided that he did not 14 want to pursue appellate remedies? 15  MR. LEV:  The  the three executions in 16 Pennsylvania since the passage of the new statute in 17 1978 were all  were all cases of prisoners who gave up 18 their rights.  I think the last contested execution was 19 sometime in the early 1960s. 20  JUSTICE ALITO:  So what's at issue here is 21 only the death penalty, not the conviction itself, 22 correct? 23  MR. LEV:  That's right. 24  JUSTICE ALITO:  And nobody has  nobody 25 other than these socalled volunteers has been convicted

1 since 1978  has been executed since 1978?

26

2  MR. LEV:  That's right.

3  But Mr. Williams remains on death row.  He

4 remains in solitary confinement, and subject to the

5 strict limitations of death row.

6  If I may, Mr. Chief Justice, I'll reserve my

7 time.

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

10  ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD EISENBERG

11  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12  MR. EISENBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may

13 it please the Court:

14  Petitioner argues that it is Judge

15 Castille's supposed direct and personal and substantial

16 involvement with this case that creates the

17 constitutional due process recusal obligation.  But as

18 he has said here today, such direct involvement in the

19 case is actually not necessary to his argument at all.

20 He has said that if the D.A. merely promulgated a policy

21 in favor of the death penalty and opposing the death

22 penalty in every case without any involvement in the

23 individual case, that that would still be a violation of

24 the due process clause.  And I  I think that very

25 fundamental 

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
27 1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do you think of our 2 jurisprudence that says you can't be judge  you can't 3 be prosecutor and judge.  And so I'm  I'm  what does 4 it mean to be a prosecutor, if you're not taking 5 responsibility personally, as he claimed during the 6 election, for the decision to execute someone, whether 7 by policy or by individual review?  And there was 8 clearly individual review here. 9  At  at what point do we give meaning to 10 the constitutional command that you can't be prosecutor 11 and judge?  I know there's so many different kinds of 12 recusals.  This is the ideal case for someone to make a 13 due process claim, because the judge here actually 14 signed his name to his review of the facts and his 15 decision to seek the death penalty. 16  What  as I'm looking at most of the 17 ethical codes, most of the ethical codes would have said 18 you get off if you made this decision. 19  MR. EISENBERG:  Your Honor, I think that's 20 exactly the point, that the  that it's the ethical 21 codes or statutes that really control for this sort of 22 situation.  And that as a constitutional question, this 23 is not the ideal case at all. 24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why? 25  MR. EISENBERG:  Because  because in this
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
28 1 Court's Caperton decision, you made it very clear that 2 it was the totality of the circumstances test that 3 looked at the  an intolerable probability of actual 4 bias in the case, no bright lines, no automatic, no 5 presumptions.  You have to look at the actual  the 6 probability of actual bias in the case.  And if Justice 7 Castille's  8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do  do you think that 9 the public would find it unusual that someone who makes 10 a decision as to whether to seek death penalty or not, 11 that the public wouldn't perceive that as a great 12 probability  13  MR. EISENBERG:  Your Honor  I'm sorry. 14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   of actual bias? 15  Now, I don't want to talk about  I don't, 16 for the moment, the history that there is some cases he 17 disagreed with.  But don't you think, as a reasonable 18 probability, that that appearance of impropriety is just 19 present? 20  MR. EISENBERG:  I think, Your Honor, that 21 after 30 years, maybe everybody wouldn't see it that 22 way, especially if they looked at the rest of his 23 record, as you have referred to. 24  And I think that the major point, Your 25 Honor, is that any sort of prior conduct by a judge in
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
29 1 his prior life that gives rise to a  an intolerable 2 probability of actual bias as the test, it's not limited 3 in some way to prosecutors, or even to people who 4 previously had some brief involvement as counsel in a 5 case. 6  So as the Court has said, one looks at the 7 psychological tendencies of human beings.  That's what 8 the Court addressed in Caperton.  And we know that there 9 are many cases, as  as Justice Breyer has referred to, 10 where judges or justices have been far more involved in 11 an issue that came before the court, once they became a 12 judge or justice later on, than Justice Castille was in 13 this case. 14  There are many instances where judges or 15 justices worked on an issue, spearheaded an issue, 16 fought for legislation, for example, for years and years 17 and years, even may have had it named after them, and 18 then sat in judgment on the constitutionality or scope 19 of that legislation. 20  Now, I think that the public would see at 21 least as much potential for bias in a situation like 22 that, at least as much possibility that the  that 23 given human psychology, a justice in that position would 24 be reluctant to overturn his or her own statute. 25  The reason that that's not a constitutional
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
1 violation is because I think that Caperton, and this

30

2 Court's law generally, recognize that judges are human

3 beings, they have prior lives, and that we don't want to

4 have a situation where the only people who can become

5 judges and sit on cases are people with no prior

6 experiences.

7  JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the number of amicus

9 briefs filed by former prosecutors and attorneys belies

10 and refutes that  that suggestion, it seems to me.

11 And Section 455 of 28 U.S.C., where we have rather

12 mechanical recusal standards, also refutes that.

13  MR. EISENBERG:  Well, Your Honor, my point

14 is not that there can be no bright lines adopted as a

15 matter of code or of statute.  Obviously there can be.

16 And the court in Caperton was very clear to make clear

17 in extended discussion that the due process test is

18 merely a constitutional floor, and that the ceiling is

19 set by those codes and statutes.  That's where you can

20 draw those sort of bright line tests, Your Honor.  And

21 in fact, as follow up 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, but you were arguing,

23 well, this is going to be unworkable.  And we know, both

24 from the briefs and the statutes, that far more rigid

25 recusal standards are in place and are quite workable.

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
31 1  MR. EISENBERG:  Well, they're  they're 2 workable, Your Honor, but it's very different to 3 constitutionalize, in essence to raise the 4 constitutional floor to the ceiling.  And that's 5 essentially what the defendant is asking for  the 6 Petitioner is asking for here, but in a way that is not 7 really internally consistent  8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What would be  9  MR. EISENBERG:   because  10  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What would be your 11 standard?  I mean, I assume you would agree that in 12 certain circumstances, a failure to recuse would raise a 13 constitutional problem. 14  MR. EISENBERG:  Yes. 15  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So how would you 16 articulate the appropriate test? 17  MR. EISENBERG:  I think the degree of the 18 prior involvement, and the, among other factors, the  19 the timing, the recency of the prior involvement have to 20 meet the Caperton standard of an intolerable likelihood 21 of actual bias in the case. 22  And if the  in a case like this where the 23 district attorney presides over a large office, has 24 many, many cases  during his tenure there were over 25 two thousand murders in the City of Philadelphia; a
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
32 1 great number of the them were death eligible.  Even if 2 20 percent were death eligible, that's 400 cases.  He's 3 not likely to remember the details of any particular 4 case. 5  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but here, of course, 6 the essence of the Brady violation has alleged  as 7 alleged, is that the evidence was concealed for years; 8 they didn't know about it. 9  MR. EISENBERG:  And he didn't know about it 10 either, Your Honor.  As has been observed, there's 11 absolutely no allegation that Justice Castille had 12 anything to do with the violation.  So to him, it was  13  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  He didn't know about it 14 because subordinates in his  his office, under his 15 supervision, concealed the facts. 16  MR. EISENBERG:  That's  that was the 17 allegation, Your Honor.  And the assumption that the 18 Petitioner wants the Court to adopt as a matter of law 19 is that then, looking at the case 30 years later, he 20 would be trying to protect himself by hiding that rather 21 than, perhaps, angry at the people who had done 22 something wrong.  There's no basis in the law  23  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Eisenberg  24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  I'm sorry.  Go 25 ahead.
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
33 1  JUSTICE KAGAN:  If I understood your answer 2 to the Chief Justice, you said significant involvement 3 in a critical trial decision would be a critical factor 4 in deciding when a person had crossed the constitutional 5 line.  You then simply said that there's kind of a 6 statute of limitations on it, and because this is 7 30 years ago, that makes a difference. 8  Am I understanding you correctly? 9  MR. EISENBERG:  I don't recall that I said 10 significant involvement in a  in a significant trial 11 decision, Your Honor.  Certainly, significant 12 involvement in the trial, and whatever that  that may 13 be. 14  And while the death penalty decision  15  JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm not sure I understood 16 the difference there.  You mean you have to be in trial 17 in the courtroom as opposed to in the office making 18 critical strategy decisions about how to prosecute a 19 case? 20  MR. EISENBERG:  No, Your Honor.  But the  21 the former, actually trying the case, is obviously much 22 more significant involvement. 23  I'm  I'm simply saying that it's  24  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, just  I mean, just 25 go back to what the test is.  So it's significant
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
1 involvement in what, at what time?

34

2  MR. EISENBERG:  Significant involvement in

3 any matter, in any case or cause that would be likely,

4 over that period of time, to create a  an intolerable

5 probability of actual bias in deciding the issue in that

6 case.

7  JUSTICE KAGAN:  And what time is the

8 critical time?

9  MR. EISENBERG:  There 

10  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is it six months?  Five

11 years?  Ten years?

12  MR. EISENBERG:  There  there is no bright

13 line there, Your Honor, any more than there was in

14 Caperton.  In Caperton you had a judge who received $3

15 million in campaign funds during the time that the case

16 that he was going to decide was pending and about to

17 reach his court.  Had he received $3,000 or $30,000, and

18 had he received it from the same man but 10 or 20 or

19 30 years earlier, it would have been a different case.

20  And the Caperton decision, in and of itself,

21 doesn't tell us the answer to all of those other

22 hypotheticals.  But it is clear that those factors

23 matter.  And as they change, the likelihood of  of an

24 intolerable probability of actual bias reduced it.

25  JUSTICE KAGAN:  But as I understand you, the

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
35 1 one factor that seems to be controlling here is the time 2 limit.  And other than that, there's  everything 3 points to due process demanding a recusal, except for 4 the time limit. 5  MR. EISENBERG:  It's  it is, as always, a 6 balancing of factors, Your Honor.  If he had tried the 7 case, if he had spent a year as the trial prosecutor in 8 this case did, actually trying the case, going in on the 9 first murder, going in on the second murder, 30 years 10 isn't going to matter that much in this  in that 11 situation. 12  JUSTICE KAGAN:  He made the most important 13 decision that could be made in this case. 14  MR. EISENBERG:  He  he concurred in the 15 recommendation to do that, Your Honor. 16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In what did he concur? 17  JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry.  Isn't there a 18 difference between those two things? 19  MR. EISENBERG:  Well, there's something of a 20 difference in terms of the implication about the level 21 of his involvement.  And the reason that that's 22 important, Your Honor, is because the question is what's 23 he going to be remembering and thinking about and 24 feeling personally committed to when he comes to this 25 case 30 years later as a judge?  That's how you assess
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
1 the likelihood of actual  of actual bias.

36

2  And if, in fact, he spent the time it takes

3 to read a oneandahalfpage memo 30 years ago in a

4 city where there were two thousand cases of murder and

5 hundreds of other death penalty cases where he was

6 reading similar murders 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think he didn't take

8 that decision extremely seriously?

9  MR. EISENBERG:  I think he took it

10 seriously, Your Honor, but I think that he took it less

11 seriously than if he had been  or involved less

12 reflection on his part than if he had been making it for

13 himself in the first 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Did all 2000 murders

20  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Were there cases where

21 he said no to some death penalties?

22  MR. EISENBERG:  No, Your Honor.  Not

24 established to establish when death penalty was

25 appropriate?

They looked at the aggravating 11 circumstances under the statute, and they decided  12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I presume they looked at 13 mitigators, too. 14  MR. EISENBERG:  Well, they may or may not 15 have, Your Honor.  At the time there was  there would 16 have been  17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the memo required 18 them to talk about some mitigating  19  MR. EISENBERG:  That's not actually true, 20 Your Honor. 21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, this memo  22  MR. EISENBERG:  This memo did spend a brief 23 portion of time.

38

2  Now, we don't know what Justice Castille

3 thought was significant about the memo.  When he read

4 the memo, he was not required to underline this part or

5 that part and say this part is important or not.  We

6 only know what he has said in prior cases where recusal

7 was sought, which was that he treated all of these cases

8 the same way.  He had the same policy and procedure for

9 all of these 

10  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Suppose this case were

11 exactly the same, except he had done it three years ago.

12 What would your answer be to that?

13  MR. EISENBERG:  I think that would be a much

14 closer question, Your Honor.

15  JUSTICE KAGAN:  What would your answer be?

16  MR. EISENBERG:  I'm not sure, Your Honor.

17  JUSTICE ALITO:  We're talking about 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So the fact that he spent

19 30 years in solitary confinement actually helps the

20 State?

21  (Laughter.)

22  MR. EISENBERG:  Well, Your Honor, as we

23 addressed in our brief, it's  it's not exactly

24 30 years in solitary confinement.  And the governor who

25 issued the moratorium  is in charge of the Department

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
39 1 of Corrections.  And if he wants to change conditions on 2 death row, he's certainly free to do so.  I don't know 3 if there's been any request by this defendant or others 4 to rearrange things in light of his moratorium. 5  JUSTICE ALITO:  We are talking about a 6 constitutional recusal rule which would have very 7 serious consequences.  So if it's  even if it isn't 8 absolutely necessary that that rule be very clear, 9 certainly it is highly desirable that it be very clear 10 so that everybody can determine with a degree of 11 certainty when the time  when the decision is made 12 whether recusal is constitutionally required or not. 13  And I really don't see a clear rule that 14 would encompass this situation, other than a rule that 15 said that a judge may  is required by the Constitution 16 to recuse in any case in which the judge had personal 17 participation as a prosecutor. 18  Anything other than that seems to me to be 19 pretty fuzzy, but that would be a pretty farreaching 20 rule.  So can you think of one that is less  that is 21 not as farreaching as that but nevertheless is clear? 22 If we talk about the number of years that passed or how 23 significant the  how significant the issue was or 24 things of that nature, those are all going to be subject 25 to a lot of uncertainty and debate.
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
40 1  MR. EISENBERG:  They are, Your Honor, but 2 that's exactly the situation in Caperton that this Court 3 addressed and ruled on.  There were no such bright lines 4 that arose out of Caperton, even on a  a matter that 5 is of great importance, which is the  the nature of  6 of campaign contributions. 7  What did happen after Caperton, though, 8 Your Honor, is that some  there was a model rule, 4.4, 9 adopted in which a bright line was drawn.  Any amount 10 over X, $3,000, $4,000, is a violation of these rules, 11 any amount under it is not.  A dollar more is a 12 violation, a dollar less is not.  That's a clear rule, 13 Your Honor.  But it was done by a rule, not by a 14 constitutional mandate.  And it will be up to each 15 individual jurisdiction what number they plug in there, 16 what campaign amount they  contribution amount they 17 think is the appropriate amount. 18  Now there's also a rule, 211, and that is 19 somewhat akin to the Federal statute 455 involving prior 20 involvement by a government lawyer in  in a case.  And 21 that really is the argument that the Petitioner has been 22 making.  He calls it a constitutional Caperton argument, 23 Your Honor, but he uses the exact language of Rule 211. 24 And that's  that would certainly be making the 25 constitutional floor into the  into the statutory
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
1 ceiling.  There would be no room in between.

41

2  But I would like to speak for a bit about

3 the second question of the case, Your Honor, because I

4 think it's actually even more troubling than the first

5 one, and I think it would be a  a radical departure

6 from a previously  from  from previous practice.

7  The Petitioner's position is that because we

8 can't know exactly what the other judges on the panel

9 do, we have to throw out the whole case.  We have to

10 assume, in  in essence, the worst.  We have to assume,

11 as a constitutional mandate, that all the other justices

12 or judges were tainted.  And that's a reversal of the

13 essential premise of judicial review, which is that at

14 least nonrecusable judges follow their oath to apply the

15 law.  And if we do abandon that principle, we have not

16 just theoretical, but very practical problems.

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So I  I suppose, for

18 purposes of phrasing the question, to reach questions

19 here, we  we will assume that there is bias; we assume

20 he should have recused.  But then is it your submission

21 that there is harmless error because it was a

22 multimember panel?

23  MR. EISENBERG:  I wouldn't call it 

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that a fair statement

25 or not?

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
42 1  MR. EISENBERG:  I wouldn't actually  I 2 don't think that the phrase "harmless error" is the best 3 way to describe the situation, Your Honor, because with 4 a multimember court, the process is the court, not any 5 individual judge. 6  At the trial level, the judge is literally 7 the court.  So if the judge is constitutionally biased, 8 there's no issue there.  But it's a very different issue 9 at the appellate level. 10  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I  just so I 11 understand the scope of your argument, you would be 12 arguing the same thing if there were three judges?  One 13 should have recused, that leaves two? 14  MR. EISENBERG:  What I would be arguing, 15 Your Honor, is that, again, a totality of the 16 circumstances test applies.  Certainly the  the vote 17 matters, okay?  If it's  if it's threetonothing, 18 that's better than twotoone.  If it's sixtonothing, 19 that's better than fourtotwo.  The vote is often going 20 to be highly dispositive. 21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But there could 22 be  23  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The  24  MR. EISENBERG:  I'm sorry, Your Honor. 25  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The main
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
43 1 circumstance is  would seem to me to be is a  a real 2 fact matter is what the deliberations of the judges were 3 like.  I mean, if the individual who should have been 4 recused occupied a dominant role in the discussion and 5 was successful in persuading colleagues and all that  6 and of course, that's the sort of evidence you certainly 7 can't have access to. 8  MR. EISENBERG:  Your Honor, of course an 9 individual justice can be persuasive to other judges or 10 justices.  On occasion, perhaps even a lawyer can be 11 persuasive.  But if so, it's by the power of their 12 reasoning.  And if they are  if other justices are 13 persuaded by something other than the power of the 14 argument, then they're not fulfilling their oaths.  If 15 they're persuaded because they like the person or if 16 they vote against because they don't like the person  17  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose you have a very 18 brilliant trial judge, and the power of his reasoning 19 is  it's persuasive and  and forceful but he's 20 biased, end of case.  You have  he has to be recused. 21  MR. EISENBERG:  Yes, Your Honor.  But the 22 difference here is that the other justices on the 23 case  other justices on the case don't have to be 24 recused.  And  25  JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, this is common in the

44

2 There are a series of cases where he had sat, that

3 judge.  And very often they are decided by the two

4 people who remain.  They don't rehear the whole case.

5  MR. EISENBERG:  Yes, Your Honor.  And I 

6  JUSTICE BREYER:  And in that case, there was

7 nothing wrong with the participation at the time.

8  MR. EISENBERG:  But, Your Honor 

9  JUSTICE BREYER:  The harder point is the

10 judge from Guam, I think, who wasn't supposed to sit in

11 the Ninth Circuit.  And again, I think we  the

12 decisions went ahead.  The same thing could come up with

13 recess appointments, and there are many of those.  And

14  but I don't know where there's a disqualification of

15 the judge because of bias.  Now, in that kind of

16 situation, is there any precedent that supports you, or

17 maybe the other way?

18  MR. EISENBERG:  Your Honor, I think that

19 there are many cases where, after disqualification, the

20 remainder of the panel goes on to decide the case.

21  JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I'm not saying  what

22 I'm looking for is a disqualification because of bias,

23 because in that circumstance there's something biased

24 about that judge being in that panel.  Now, in that

25 situation

1  MR. EISENBERG:  Your Honor

2  JUSTICE BREYER:   I can think of a lot of

3 others that I've just mentioned.

4  MR. EISENBERG:  Your Honor 

5  JUSTICE BREYER:  In that situation, are

6 there instances  how does it cut?  What does the ABA

7 say about that one and  and what have you found?

8  MR. EISENBERG:  I think it's addressed by

9 Advisory Opinion No. 71 in the guide for  for the

10 counsel from the  I believe from the judicial

11 conference.  I'm not sure exactly the  the authority,

12 but it's an advisory opinion for Federal judges.  And it

13 says that where a judge recuses during the process, the

14 remaining judges can carry on.  And I think that these

15 recusals will often occur 

16  JUSTICE BREYER:  Recuses because  go

17 ahead.

18  MR. EISENBERG:   under  under Section

19 455, Your Honor, which, as this Court has described

20 it 

21  JUSTICE BREYER:  Uhhuh.

22  MR. EISENBERG:   covers both actual bias

23 and the possibility of actual bias.

24  JUSTICE BREYER:  Uhhuh.  Uhhuh.

25  MR. EISENBERG:  And there's no such

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
46 1 distinctions made in the advisory rule.  And many of the 2 cases cited by either Petitioner or ourselves have 3 actually relied on Advisory Opinion No. 71. 4  Now, under Petitioner's position, that's 5 impossible because the  the recused judge has already 6 participated in the process.  It doesn't matter if he 7 gets out before the vote, and  8  JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, but there  9 there's a difference, you see, where the judge recuses 10 himself during the process.  The remaining judges know 11 that.  And because they know that, they make an effort 12 to decide it among the two. 13  Where the judge didn't recuse himself during 14 the process, the other judges take his point of view 15 into account, just as they would if they're in any 16 ordinary circumstance.  Now, in practice, I think that's 17 a big difference. 18  MR. EISENBERG:  Your Honor, they  they 19 always take the other judges' opinions. 20  JUSTICE BREYER:  Not  not in an instance 21 where you know that you shouldn't because that judge  22  MR. EISENBERG:  But  23  JUSTICE BREYER:   should not have 24 participated. 25  MR. EISENBERG:  But under Petitioner's point

Official
47 1 of view, Your Honor, we can't know that.  His whole  2  JUSTICE BREYER:  You can't know it at the 3 moment. 4  MR. EISENBERG:  His whole  5  JUSTICE BREYER:  But  but what you  what 6 you do know at the moment is that the two judges, or 7 six, or whoever were there didn't think we must ignore 8 his situation, what he thinks.  They didn't think that, 9 so of course, they didn't. 10  In the situation that they're talking about 11 in the ABA, I take it the remaining judges do know that 12 they are not to take into account the opinion of the 13 judge who is out of it. 14  MR. EISENBERG:  But they can't know whether 15 they were biased by it, Your Honor.  That is the 16 Petitioner's position, is that we can't  17  JUSTICE ALITO:  In  in  18  MR. EISENBERG:   rely on the other judges 19 to know what may have biased them from whether they 20 were. 21  JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I  22  MR. EISENBERG:   biased by the 23 participation in some  24  JUSTICE ALITO:  In this case, did the other 25 justices of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court know about
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
1 the recusal motion at the time of the decision?

48

2  MR. EISENBERG:  The recusal motion was 

3 was docketed, Your Honor, and so they undoubtedly knew

4 about it.  And they also knew that prior motions had

5 been filed.  And, in fact, in prior cases, as we've

6 pointed out, the Petitioner actually essentially

7 appealed from the individual decision of Justice

8 Castille not to recuse, and asked the rest of the court

9 to 

10  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But in the other cases

11 in which that was the case, no one knew that he was

12 actually signing off on a review of the cases.

13  MR. EISENBERG:  They  they knew that the

14 allegation was that he was personally approving them,

15 Your Honor.  That has been known all along.  Prior

16 recusal motions were based on that assertion that he was

17 personally recusing them.  Now, there's any number of

18 ways in which he could have done that.  He could have

19 hold  held a conclave.  He could have had a weeklong

20 meeting to decide every individual case.  He didn't do

21 that.  What he actually did was much less involvement

22 than that sort of process would have entailed.

23  So the fact that they didn't have the memo

24 didn't change the essential point of the  of  of the

25 argument.  And, in fact, Petitioner said here today that

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
1 even if the district attorney had a flat policy and

49

2 didn't look at any individual cases, that would still be

3 a recusal problem.

4  And I  I think that the  the

5 participation or the involvement of other justices is 

6 is really one of the core problems here.  Because under

7 the Petitioner's point of view, it really can't happen,

8 because they  they will be tainted by the justice who

9 they're looking at.  They're collegial.  It's a

10 collegial process, he says.  And because of that, they

11 can't really know what they're  whether they've been

12 affected by what he did.  And so we really have a  a

13 dead end or  or a circularity here, Your Honor,

14 because there's  there's nowhere to go.

15  And if you look to  to pick up on earlier

16 questions, if you look at this Court's historic

17 practices, as it's termed in recusal matters, it is to

18 refer a recusal motion to an individual justice, and

19 that's it.

20  Now, under Petitioner's approach, I think

21 that's seriously problematic, a difficulty for the

22 Court.

23  You have two options:  Either to continue

24 that practice, having held, if you adopt Petitioner's

25 point of view, that the failure to recuse, the erroneous

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
1 failure to recuse, taints the votes of every other

50

2 justice on the Court, but the Court declines to look at

3 the issue; or you adopt a new practice in which the

4 Court, in fact, looks at the recusal of  the

5 individual recusal and makes a decision for itself,

6 which puts it in the position of deciding who the

7 members of the Court will be on any particular case.

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm a little confused by

9 this, and this line of argument.

10  What is Pennsylvania?  Each individual judge

11 decides whether to recuse, correct?

12  MR. EISENBERG:  Actually, in Pennsylvania,

13 Your Honor, there was the opportunity for full court

14 review, and Petitioner just didn't avail himself of it

15 in this case.  He did in the prior case.  So we know the

16 procedure 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought we were told

18 that he had to go through the judge who wants to recuse.

19 He cannot make a motion directly to the panel.  He has

20 to say, Judge, you should recuse, and I want you to

21 refer the question.

22  MR. EISENBERG:  That is a  a misstatement

23 of the internal operating procedures, Your Honor.  The

24 Court held in the Goodheart case, that is cited in

25 Petitioner's brief, that while the decision was in the

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
51 1 first instance for the individual judge  justice, the 2 full court will look at the matter and, if necessary, 3 would tell that justice that he has to recuse. 4  And, in fact, the Court followed the 5 practice of looking at it in the previous case  6  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  One thing is look at it. 7 What triggers the look?  That is, is the defendant 8 permitted to say I want the judges who did not 9 participate to make this decision? 10  MR. EISENBERG:  Yes, Your Honor. 11  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So  12  MR. EISENBERG:  And counsel did so in a 13 prior case only several years ago.  They filed a motion 14 for reconsideration.  Justice Castille recused himself 15 on that motion, and the full court went on to decide it. 16  Under the IOPs, motions for reconsideration 17 go to the individual justice, not to the Chief Justice. 18 So if Petitioner's theory were correct, Justice Castille 19 could have blocked that reconsideration.  He did not. 20 He recused himself and passed it on to the rest of the 21 court. 22  When, under the IOPs, a matter is assigned 23 to an individual justice on the Pennsylvania Supreme 24 Court, a full court matter is assigned to an individual 25 justice.  Section 2 of the IOP states explicitly that
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
1 the assignment neither enhances the power of the

52

2 assigned judge nor diminishes the power of the other

3 Justices ensured to proper disposition.

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  That's

5 really wonderful.  And how about if they got it wrong?

6  MR. EISENBERG:  They were never 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Meaning  it doesn't

8 mean that if a whole court looks at something, it's got

9 it right.

10  MR. EISENBERG:  Of course, it 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If there's an ethical

12 standard that says the judge who's been involved in a

13 case shouldn't be there, then they got it wrong on their

14 own rules.  If  if there's a constitutional standard,

15 it doesn't mean they were right, either.  They got it

16 wrong if they let him sit.

17  MR. EISENBERG:  Yes, Your Honor, but they

18 still face a dilemma, because they have to make a

19 decision about whether the 

20  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they have to do it

21 no matter what, meaning if  if the State is telling

22 them look at this, and recuse someone if it's

23 appropriate to do so, then the State has imposed that

24 obligation on them.

25  MR. EISENBERG:  Well, the question is

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
53 1 whether the Constitution imposes the obligation for the 2 full court to look at.  And, in fact, in his recusal  3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Nothing about a decision 4 in this case would require that.  That's  5  MR. EISENBERG:  In  6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a feature unique 7 to Pennsylvania.  In many other States, including this 8 Court, it goes up to the individual judge. 9  MR. EISENBERG:  In his recusal motion, Your 10 Honor, at page 200 in the Joint Appendix  I'm sorry, 11 at page 202 in the Joint Appendix, you'll see that the 12 Petitioner made exactly this argument. 13  He said, "Indeed, due process requires"  14 emphasis in the original  "requires that the full 15 court decide due processbased recusal claims." 16  And I think on Petitioner's theory, that 17 would be true because it's a constitutional issue, and 18 the failure to decide it potentially taints the rest of 19 the court so that the action of the entire court is 20 automatically invalid. 21  And that's, I think, not what due process 22 requires, because at the appellate level, the process is 23 not the individual judge, it's the court.  And the 24 recusal or nonrecusal of an individual judge does not in 25 and of itself automatically result in a deprivation of
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
54 1 due process, because he is not the process.  The court 2 is the process. 3  And you look at a variety of circumstances 4 to decide whether the other members of the court  5 under an objective standard, you can't know what they 6 are doing subjectively, of course.  But on the same 7 objective standards applied in Caperton, to determine 8 whether there is a probability of actual bias on the 9 part of the other members of the court, whether it's a 10 court of three, or a court as some en banc courts can 11 be, a court of 15.  Under the Petitioner's view, even 12 the 15tonothing vote would be automatically, 13 constitutionally invalid.  And we don't think that 14 that's  15  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if  if we say that, 16 then we say that being a judge on a 15judge court 17 doesn't really make much difference.  You  you don't 18 have a duty, and you don't have an obligation.  You 19 can't persuade your colleagues.  It's very hard for us 20 to write that kind of decision. 21  MR. EISENBERG:  May I, Your Honor? 22  Your Honor, I think the answer is what the 23 Pennsylvania Supreme Court states in its Section 2 of 24 its IOPs.  On every court of every size, it is the duty 25 of each individual justice to make an independent
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
55 1 determination following his oath to do the right thing, 2 and that is why the court is not automatically invalid. 3  Thank you. 4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 5  Mr. Lev, four minutes remaining. 6  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STUART B. LEV 7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8  MR. LEV:  Thank you. 9  Let's start with the passage of time.  In 10 our view, the passage of time isn't the relevant factor. 11 It's that it's the same case. 12  This is  even though this case has lasted 13 a very, very long time through numerous different 14 hearings and delays, this is the same case.  And so what 15 you had was Chief Justice Castille participating in this 16 case as both the prosecutor and a judge in the same 17 case.  And that's where the problem  that's where the 18 due process problem starts. 19  What separates this out from the ethical 20 rules is that this is an extreme and rare case.  That's 21 what Caperton was talking about, where the ethical rules 22 were not sufficient to cover the problems here.  And we 23 know that this is an extreme and rare case because 24 there's no other case like it, right?  There's no other 25 case that Respondents have cited to, and none that we
Alderson Court Reporting

Official
1 found, where a judge in this situation has sat and

56

2 decided on the case.

3  JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, this may be an extreme

4 case, but if we do not say any personal participation

5 requires recusal under the Constitution, what other

6 clear line can you give us?

7  MR. LEV:  Well, to the extent that Caperton

8 is not a clear line, I think we're  we're still with

9 Caperton.  If you want to clarify the line of Caperton,

10 it is about the  the judge's participation in a

11 significant decisionmaking in the case.  And where the

12 issues before them are related to that decisionmaking,

13 that's  that's the line I would suggest that you can

14 draw in this case.

15  On  on question two, if you accept the

16 Respondent's position, what you would be saying is it's

17 okay to have one  one biased judge on an appellate

18 panel, or two, or three, so long as a majority voted in

19 favor were not biased.  And that's not appropriate under

20 the Due Process Clause, the idea of fairness, the public

21 confidence in the integrity of the fairness of the

22 system requires that each judge be free from bias.

23  And lastly, I would say about referring to

24 the full court, we did that.  We asked, if you look at

25 our motion to recuse that's in the Joint Appendix, I

Alderson Court Reporting

Official
57 1 think at Section 4 of our motion says if Judge Castille 2 denies this, we ask that the full court hear it.  And 3 Justice Castille, using his power as the Chief Justice, 4 blocked that.  He said, I'm going to deny the motion to 5 recuse, and I'm going to deny referral to the full 6 court. 7  So we did what we could to have the full 8 court hear it, and we weren't able to get that. 9  Thank you very much. 10  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 11 The case is submitted. 12  (Whereupon, at 11:56 a.m., the case in the 13 aboveentitled matter was submitted.) 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
