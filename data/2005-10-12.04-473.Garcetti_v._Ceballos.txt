3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument now

4 in Garcetti v. Ceballos.

5 Ms. Lee.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CINDY LEE

7 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

8 MS. LEE: Chief Justice Roberts, and may it

9 please the Court:

10 The issue presented is whether the first

11 amendment requires protection for all public employee

12 speech that touches on a matter of public concern without

13 any consideration of whether the speech was expressed as a

14 citizen.

15 The Ninth Circuit's approach affords no

16 consideration for the role of the speaker as a citizen or

17 an employee at the time of the speech. This approach,

18 however, plants a seed of a constitutional claim in

19 virtually every speech that public employees express while

20 carrying out their regular job duties.

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's -- I mean, I can

22 see --

23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you think that the Court

24 tried to apply the Pickering test?

25 MS. LEE: The Ninth Circuit clearly did not

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 apply the Pickering test when they were doing the initial

2 analysis, a threshold analysis, of whether or not the

3 speech at issue was constitutionally protected.

4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you think that the

5 Pickering test, properly applied, would have reached a

6 different result in this case?

7 MS. LEE: Not necessarily, not the way the Ninth

8 --

9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It could have --

10 MS. LEE: -- Circuit viewed it.

11 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- certainly.

12 MS. LEE: Well, in the Ninth Circuit's view, the

13 capacity of an employee at the time of the speech is of

14 some factor. It's a determinative factor. But, in its

15 view, it was a factor that should be weighed against

16 finding no constitutional protection. In its view --

17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you think that the proper

18 application of Pickering would yield a different result in

19 this case?

20 MS. LEE: Our view is that --

21 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Could it?

22 MS. LEE: -- if the application of the Pickering

23 is rearticulated such that when job-required speech is at

24 issue, like in this case, the employer should invariably

25 win or have a -- an easier time of prevailing. But, in

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 this case, the Ninth Circuit didn't see it that way. The

2 Ninth Circuit took the view that the capacity of an

3 employee at the time of the speech is a factor, but it

4 would be difficult for an employer to justify employment

5 decisions made when the employee is speaking as required

6 by the duties of employment.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Counsel, you've made the point

8 that if we go the Ninth Circuit way, every time an

9 employee gets in Dutch there's a potential first amendment

10 issue. Why hasn't that been a problem since 1988 in the

11 Ninth Circuit? I think 1988 was the year of the Circuit's

12 Roth decision. So, we haven't seen a deluge, and doesn't

13 that rather discount your argument?

14 MS. LEE: Well, our view is that if we accept

15 the Ninth Circuit's approach, then speech by public

16 employees expressed while carrying out their assigned job

17 duties would virtually -- invariably be --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: No.

19 MS. LEE: -- a matter --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: I realize that, but that -- as

21 I understand it, that has been true since the Ninth

22 Circuit's Roth decision in 1988. And apparently we have

23 not seen a deluge of these claims, or we would have had

24 citations to the cases. So, doesn't that rather discount

25 the concern that you express?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. LEE: Not necessarily. The Ninth Circuit

2 and the other circuits that have made, primarily, content

3 the determinative factor in finding presumptive first-

4 amendment protection have, in some regards, considered the

5 capacity of an employee as whether or not the speech

6 should be protected under the first amendment, but they've

7 done so in the context of whether or not it is a matter of

8 public concern. So, the Ninth Circuit is alone in having

9 addressed squarely whether or not job-required speech

10 should not be afforded presumptive first-amendment

11 protection. The other --

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: But didn't -- maybe I'm wrong

13 on my assumption, but didn't the Ninth Circuit take that

14 position, back in 1988?

15 MS. LEE: That's correct.

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with a

18 public university professor, who -- is fired for the

19 content of his lectures? Certainly, in the course of his

20 employment, that's what he's paid to do. That has no

21 first-amendment protection?

22 MS. LEE: Well, it would be our view that if the

23 assigned job duties of that university professor was to

24 speak on a particular topic or content, and they were

25 getting paid for doing that, that that is a job-required

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 speech and that it should not be entitled, presumptively,

2 to first-amendment protection. Now, that is a far cry

3 from --

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: "Should not be entitled,

5 presumptively, to first-amendment protection," what does

6 that mean? That there might be first amendment

7 protection, in light of the particular context --

8 MS. LEE: Our --

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- of the speech?

10 MS. LEE: Well, according to the Ninth Circuit's

11 view, anything -- anytime a public employee speaks, and

12 that speech relates to a matter of public concern, that is

13 presumptively entitled to first-amendment protection, such

14 that the burden is on the employer to justify the

15 decisions for the employment actions taken.

16 Our view is that the employer should not have

17 that burden until the first threshold is made, that the

18 speech is expressed as a citizen on a matter of public

19 concern.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose that, in the

21 situation the Chief Justice mentioned, the professor would

22 still be able to contend that the university fired him

23 because it disagreed with the political content of his

24 speech or because of the university's politics. He could

25 still make that claim, couldn't he?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. LEE: Our approach would not prohibit that

2 --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the --

4 MS. LEE: -- kind of --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- burden would be on him, as

6 it would be in most cases --

7 MS. LEE: That's correct, Justice Scalia.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to show that that was true.

9 MS. LEE: That's correct.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Whereas, the Ninth Circuit

11 would put it on the -- put the burden on the university to

12 show that it wasn't true.

13 MS. LEE: That's correct. The ninth --

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought you

15 might have argued that it's speech paid for by the

16 Government, that's what they pay him for, it's their

17 speech; and so, there's no first-amendment issue at all.

18 MS. LEE: In essence, the principle of our

19 approach is supported by those Government subsidizer

20 cases, like the Rust v. Sullivan. Our --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in Rust v. Sullivan, the

22 Government was buying a commodity. It was the

23 Government's program, and it was employing people, funding

24 people to implement that program. Here is a person whose

25 job includes being candid, serving justice, serving truth.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 If that's part of his job responsibilities, that's quite

2 different from speaking the speech that the Government

3 wants spoken.

4 MS. LEE: Well, in this case, we think that the

5 job duties are aligned with those subsidizer cases. We

6 have a deputy district attorney whose job duty was to

7 assess the merits of the prosecution's case, which he did.

8 That includes assessing the credibility of a witness.

9 Because his conclusions in this case were that the

10 prosecution's witness was not very credible does not make

11 that task extraordinary.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess if your job is to speak

13 truth, and you speak falsehood, that's a good reason to

14 fire you, which is what happened here.

15 MS. LEE: That could be a --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you don't --

17 MS. LEE: -- legitimate reason. Or --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- contend that, do you?

19 MS. LEE: -- or the employer doesn't --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you contend --

21 MS. LEE: -- necessarily have to --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- that his statement was

23 false? Do you contend the speech was false?

24 MS. LEE: Our position is that the speech was

25 inaccurate and that --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but how do we know that?

2 We're at summary judgment.

3 MS. LEE: Well, we have the -- the deputy

4 district attorney's disposition memorandum assessed that

5 -- in his view, that the prosecution was going to lose on

6 the pending motion to dismiss, in -- on the grounds of

7 that the search warrant was going to be -- was going to be

8 found invalid. That was the essence of the deputy

9 district attorney's assessment. And in his memorandum, as

10 part of his prosecutorial duties, he evaluated that. He

11 told his supervisor, "Look, you know, I'm looking at the

12 credibility of the officer. I conducted an investigation.

13 I don't think we're going to win on this case." The

14 supervisor initially thought, "Okay, you have a point,"

15 but ultimately decided, "You know what? I'm not as sure

16 as you are. We have a motion to traverse on calendar,

17 where we have a judge who's going to be assessing that, so

18 let's see what happens." That judge found that the search

19 warrant was valid. And so, in essence, we have a public

20 employee who is challenging employment decisions made by

21 his supervisors --

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I realize that, but where

23 do you -- how do you infer, from that, that the

24 individual, the employee, was not telling the truth?

25 MS. LEE: That --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: If --

2 MS. LEE: It is not our --

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- if I --

4 MS. LEE: -- position --

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- if my ethical record

6 amounted to a lie every time I made a -- an inaccurate

7 prediction about what a court was going to do when I was a

8 young lawyer, I would have had a very short career.

9 [Laughter.]

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: And that seems to me as much as

11 you can infer from what this individual did.

12 MS. LEE: Justice Souter, it is not our

13 position, and we have never taken the stance, that the

14 deputy district attorney in this case was reckless in

15 regards of his speech --

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh. Oh. Okay.

17 MS. LEE: -- or his evaluation.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, we don't --

19 MS. LEE: Our view is that --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- we don't know why it didn't

21 pan out the way he said it was going to, and we don't know

22 that he was -- that he was lying.

23 MS. LEE: Correct. What --

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

25 MS. LEE: -- we do know is that the -- it is our

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 view that the supervisor -- while the supervisor contended

2 that he did not react to this speech adversely, that he

3 could have. We have here speech that was required by the

4 job. The employee here -- if we take the Ninth Circuit's

5 approach, we would be providing public employees a

6 constitutional right to perform their assigned job-

7 required duties in a way that is to the dissatisfaction of

8 the public employer.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have to establish

10 that he was lying; just that his prediction -- his job,

11 was to predict, and he made a -- an erroneous -- a false

12 prediction. Don't have to show that he intended to do

13 that.

14 MS. LEE: That's correct, Justice Scalia.

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the disposition by

16 the -- I mean, his grievance by the hearing examiner was

17 that there was no retaliation. He assumed that the speech

18 was proper and there was no inefficiency or misconduct on

19 the part of the speaker.

20 MS. LEE: Well, the internal grievance procedure

21 resulted in the finding that the supervisors did not

22 retaliate against the deputy district attorney for the --

23 for his job-required duties.

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: And, in my understanding, that

25 was the only defense that was made for the charge, that,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 "We didn't retaliate." There was no claim that the speech

2 was improper in any way. Am I wrong on that?

3 MS. LEE: That's correct --

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

5 MS. LEE: -- Justice Stevens.

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: So, we assume, for purposes of

7 our case, that what he said was totally accurate and did

8 not, itself, provide the basis for saying he was

9 incompetent or something of that -- like that.

10 MS. LEE: Well, we assume, for purposes of the

11 summary judgment motion, that he was within his

12 prosecutorial duties in making those assessments.

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you one --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, I'm not sure I

15 understood the answer to the first question, John. Was he

16 not fired because he had made an improper assessment?

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: No.

18 MS. LEE: No, our position has never been that

19 the supervisors took any retaliatory action as a result of

20 his speech. He was not fired. What the --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

22 MS. LEE: -- deputy district attorney --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

24 MS. LEE: -- challenges here is various

25 employment decisions by his supervisor, claiming that they

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 were in retaliation for him having prepared and

2 communicated a disposition memorandum that was within the

3 course and scope of his employment duties.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: And your defense is that the --

5 MS. LEE: Our --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- actions were not taken with

7 any reference to this -- to this at all.

8 MS. LEE: -- our position has been that the

9 employer could certainly have reacted, or responded, to

10 the speech or the way he conducted his job, or performed

11 his job, but they didn't, in this case. There were --

12 there were legitimate business reasons for the employment

13 --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's surely a --

15 MS. LEE: -- decisions made.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- surely a factual inquiry,

17 which will be disputed. If you want to win on summary

18 judgment, it seems to me you have to establish that,

19 assuming he was fired because of this speech, that would

20 be -- or not promoted because of his speech -- that would

21 be perfectly okay.

22 MS. LEE: That's correct --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's where --

24 MS. LEE: -- Justice Scalia.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- we are.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. LEE: That's --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: We assume --

3 MS. LEE: -- that's correct.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that that was the reason for

5 the later actions.

6 MS. LEE: And the problem with the Ninth

7 Circuit's approach is that every time there is job

8 performance at issue that's required by the public

9 employee, it essentially puts the question before a jury

10 or a Federal court to assess the motives --

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what is your position?

12 MS. LEE: -- to assess the reasonableness of the

13 decisions made.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Lee, is your position

15 that job-required speech -- an assistant district

16 attorney's obligation is to give his best opinion -- that

17 job-required speech is outside the first-amendment

18 protection? You say the Ninth Circuit went too far, in

19 one way. But are you saying that as long as it's related

20 to his job, it's simply not protected by the first

21 amendment? Is that your position?

22 MS. LEE: Our view is that job-required speech

23 is not of a character for which principles of first

24 amendment should protect. In Pickering, the public school

25 teacher sought to be treated as a member of the general

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 public when he sent his letter to the newspaper

2 criticizing the allocation of financial resources by the

3 school board.

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, I understand --

5 MS. LEE: Nothing like that arises --

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I understand that, but I

7 was confused by your answer to Justice O'Connor, because

8 the question was, Would this come out a different way

9 under Pickering? And I take it your answer is, this

10 doesn't come in the door, because he's not speaking as a

11 citizen.

12 MS. LEE: Under the current -- my -- under my

13 current understanding of the Pickering balancing -- which

14 is -- shifts the burden to the employer to justify the

15 employment decisions made -- that we don't -- I don't

16 necessarily believe that the Pickering would clearly weigh

17 in favor of the employer in this case, even though the

18 speech was so connected to the duties of employment --

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm confused. You think that

20 this -- there was an aspect of it that was citizen speech?

21 Why --

22 MS. LEE: No.

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I --

24 MS. LEE: We contend that it should -- in

25 situations where the speech at issue is job-required, and

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that employee is getting paid for engaging in that kind of

2 duty, that the balance should weigh in favor of the

3 employer. And I believe the respondent --

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what do you mean --

5 MS. LEE: -- concedes as much.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- by "the balance, weigh in

7 favor"? Because, a moment ago, I thought you answered me,

8 "This kind of speech simply is not shielded by the" --

9 MS. LEE: That's correct.

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- "first amendment."

11 MS. LEE: Our -- the -- our view is that job-

12 required speech should not be protected under the first

13 amendment, so there is no need to go into the balancing,

14 there is no need to go into the weighing of the interests

15 of the employer versus the interest of the employee. The

16 balancing has been required in the -- in the line of cases

17 that the Court has held -- the language that the Court has

18 used in this first-amendment public-employment context is,

19 when you do the balancing, you weigh the interests of the

20 State, as an employer, versus the interests of the

21 employee, as a citizen, when engaging in this speech. Our

22 view is that the balancing should only be required when

23 the --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: You would give --

25 MS. LEE: -- public employee --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- greater protection to a

2 public speech than to a comment from -- on the job from --

3 to one's superior. Can you give me an example of a

4 statement that would provide -- be entitled to complete

5 first-amendment protection if made in a speech, but could

6 justify a discharge if made face to face with your

7 employer?

8 MS. LEE: I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Could you give me an example

10 of a statement that would be protected in a public speech,

11 but, if made privately to your superior, could provide the

12 basis for a discharge?

13 MS. LEE: I believe the Court's referring to

14 facts similar to Givhan, where there you had speech made

15 privately to a supervisor, and --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which was --

17 MS. LEE: -- this Court --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- protected.

19 MS. LEE: -- this Court has found that it was

20 protected under the first amendment.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

22 MS. LEE: However, the Court did not need to

23 address the role of the speaker in that case, because

24 there you had an English teacher who was criticizing the

25 racial --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: You're not --

2 MS. LEE: -- policies --

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- responding to my question.

4 My question is, Can you give me an example of a statement

5 that would be entitled to protection if made in a public

6 speech, but could be a basis for discharge if made face to

7 face?

8 MS. LEE: It could be in this case, where the

9 prosecutor, who is assigned, or authorized, to speak on

10 behalf of the DA's office in a pending criminal action,

11 made comments to the press about the nature of the case,

12 but, rather -- and, in this particular scenario, goes too

13 far, goes beyond what the DA's office allowed him to speak

14 on.

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm --

16 MS. LEE: He could --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- asking you if --

18 MS. LEE: -- certainly be discharged for that.

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- what he says privately

20 could the basis for a discharge. Surely, he couldn't be

21 discharged for what you just described.

22 MS. LEE: The -- under our approach, the issue

23 is not whether it's privately or publicly. If the job

24 requires him to speak in a -- within the internal

25 channels, then that speech -- he's doing his job, he's

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 getting paid for it, and he should not be entitled to

2 first-amendment protection.

3 Unless there are any other questions --

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that --

5 MS. LEE: -- I'd like to --

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- is that true in this case?

7 I realize they didn't get to it on summary judgment, but

8 is that true in this case with respect to a Brady

9 disclosure?

10 MS. LEE: Brady disclosures are the obligations

11 of the district attorney's office. So, in this case, when

12 the deputy district attorney believed that it should be

13 disclosed, his supervisor had an absolute right to, say,

14 on behalf of the DA's office, challenge that decision to

15 disclose.

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: What if -- what if the lawyer

17 simply believes that he has an ethical obligation to make

18 the disclosure, and he makes it, and he is then subject to

19 retaliation? No first amendment claim on his part?

20 MS. LEE: Those ethical obligations would build

21 -- would arise from his capacity as a prosecutor.

22 Prosecutors are employees. Governmental employees have a

23 general standard of ethical conduct. That doesn't mean

24 that they are getting paid for the same assigned job

25 duties.

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, does that mean -- what's

2 your answer to my question? If he makes the Brady

3 disclosure because he believes that is an ethical

4 obligation, and he is then subject to retaliation, does he

5 have a first amendment claim, or not?

6 MS. LEE: It's our view that he does not.

7 I'd like to reserve the remainder of --

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you --

9 MS. LEE: -- my time for rebuttal.

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- Ms. Lee.

11 Mr. Himmelfarb.

12 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB

13 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

14 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS

15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What's your answer to that

16 last question, Mr. Himmelfarb?

17 MR. HIMMELFARB: A Brady obligation is an

18 obligation of a prosecutor in his capacity as a

19 prosecutor; and a Brady disclosure, like a recommendation

20 to a superior that there should be a Brady disclosure,

21 constitutes the exercise of the prosecutorial function by

22 a prosecutor. It is employee speech, and that speech, if

23 it engenders an employment action, should not be

24 sufficient for the employee to get past the first step of

25 the Pickering balancing. If there is --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So, no free-speech protection

2 under Pickering.

3 MR. HIMMELFARB: That's exactly right, Justice

4 O'Connor.

5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And how about this case?

6 Could it not be resolved under a proper handling of

7 Pickering?

8 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, we think a proper

9 handling of Pickering is that respondents should not get

10 past step one of the balancing, because the speech is

11 expressed in his capacity as an employee.

12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, what about retaliation

13 claims that the employee may have? What about

14 whistleblower-type claims by an employer? Are they -- are

15 they separate from the first-amendment concerns?

16 MR. HIMMELFARB: We don't think they are,

17 Justice O'Connor, if the whistle-blowing is required by

18 the employee's speech. If an investigator in an inspector

19 general's office, whose job it is to investigate and

20 report government misconduct, reports misconduct, and an

21 action is taken as a result -- an employment action is

22 taken against them as a result -- he is demoted or

23 transferred, because it's the view of his superior that he

24 didn't perform his job properly in speaking on that issue

25 -- that should not enable the investigator to get past the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 first step.

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if the reason -- what if

3 the reason for the -- for firing him is that he's a

4 Democrat and it's a Republican Administration, and the

5 speech is used as the pretext?

6 MR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Scalia, I think that

7 case would be covered by this Court's patronage cases,

8 which would absolutely prohibit that sort of employment

9 action. But in a case where it's not party affiliation

10 that motivates the employment action, if the speech is

11 expressed in carrying out the employee's duties, he may

12 have a civil-service remedy -- indeed, that's precisely

13 what the civil-service laws were designed to deal with, a

14 situation where the employee is just doing his job, an

15 action is taken again him, and there's a dispute as to

16 whether he was doing his job properly, about whether he

17 was insubordinate, or simply about whether he was --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that we have an

19 instance where it is job related. He is not speaking as a

20 private citizen, and it's also a public concern. Now, in

21 such an instance, could we say that, at least if the

22 matter of public concern rise to the level where it's

23 related to an independent constitutional protection --

24 say, founded in the due-process clause -- under those

25 circumstances, the employer cannot unreasonably -- though

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 we give him an area of discretion, he cannot unreasonably

2 retaliate.

3 MR. HIMMELFARB: I don't think so, Justice --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not?

5 MR. HIMMELFARB: -- Breyer.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? And here is an

7 independent obligation.

8 MR. HIMMELFARB: To --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: It's very unusual --

10 MR. HIMMELFARB: To --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: -- but it's there.

12 MR. HIMMELFARB: To use the example of this

13 case, if respondent advised his supervisor that, in his

14 professional judgment, a Brady disclosure should be made,

15 and if the supervisor disagreed with him, and if

16 reasonable minds could differ as to whether the disclosure

17 should be made, and he made it, nonetheless, he would be

18 insubordinate. And we don't think that that is the --

19 JUSTICE BREYER: You'd only lose -- the

20 Government would lose, only where you can conclude that

21 they could -- "they," the Government -- could not -- could

22 not reasonably conclude that he'd been insubordinate.

23 MR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Breyer --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: So, we covered the case of the

25 Democrat, Republican, et cetera. In other words, we'd

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 give him -- should we give him total discretion? Can't we

2 limit that discretion of the supervisor?

3 MR. HIMMELFARB: If it's -- if it's a situation

4 where reasonable minds cannot differ, and the superior

5 directs him not to make the disclosure, in clear

6 contravention of the due-process clause as interpreted in

7 Brady, that is a situation --

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Himmelfarb, in that

9 case he could also be fired if he made the statement in a

10 speech, could he not?

11 MR. HIMMELFARB: If he made the statement in a

12 public speech --

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

14 MR. HIMMELFARB: -- or in a letter to the editor

15 of a newspaper, we think that speech would be

16 presumptively protected by the first amendment.

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: But could he not be fired if

18 the scenario you just described as --

19 MR. HIMMELFARB: Maybe he could, Justice

20 Stevens, but that would be subject to balancing, and it

21 would be the employer's duty to justify the firing, based

22 on workplace disruption.

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me odd that the

24 employee has greater protection if he goes outside the

25 regular channels and makes a speech than if he does -- he

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 goes right to his superior and says, "I think this is

2 what's wrong and should be remedied."

3 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, it's not that odd,

4 Justice Stevens, because if you have an obligation to

5 report misconduct -- take, again, the example of the

6 investigator in the inspector general's office -- you will

7 ordinarily be better off by reporting it through the

8 ordinary channels.

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

10 MR. HIMMELFARB: Because, ordinarily, you have

11 --

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: You may have no constitutional

13 protection. But if you go ahead and make a speech, you

14 do.

15 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, you have presumptive

16 first-amendment protection. If you work in the inspector

17 general's office, and there is a prohibition on disclosing

18 pending investigations, and you hold a press conference,

19 there is a very good chance you're going to lose at step

20 two of Pickering, which is why it's in your interest to

21 disclose it through appropriate channels, because --

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it's going to be

23 clear that that's violating your job, and it has an

24 adverse impact on your job-related duties, because you're

25 going public, instead of going through the channels.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, that's right. If you

2 have an -- if it's a part of your job, you have an

3 incentive to do it, just like any other job requirement.

4 And it's ordinarily not the case that public employees are

5 punished for doing their jobs. They're more often

6 punished for not doing their jobs. So, in that situation,

7 the employee is going to likely be better off by making

8 the disclosure through appropriate channels.

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: But he has less constitutional

10 protection.

11 MR. HIMMELFARB: That's true, Justice Stevens,

12 but civil -- it's our view that civil service laws are the

13 mechanism for dealing with a situation where you're doing

14 your job and there's a dispute as to whether you're doing

15 it properly or not.

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How comfortable are you

17 that this line you're trying to draw is one that's going

18 to be workable in practice? I mean, suppose the employee

19 writes a memo, and the boss comes and says, "If you don't

20 promise me you're not going to talk about this publicly,

21 you're fired." And he says, "Well, I'm not going to

22 promise that." And so, he's fired. Now, is that

23 internal, or is that external?

24 MR. HIMMELFARB: If the -- if the memo is

25 required by his job, it's --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

2 MR. HIMMELFARB: -- a recommendation about what

3 policy the agency --

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's --

5 MR. HIMMELFARB: -- should take --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- required by his job.

7 But "promise that he's not going to talk about it" is not

8 required by his job. And this case, kind of, raises the

9 question, because the only reason it's squarely presented

10 on the memo is because the Court didn't reach the Brady

11 disclosure or the talk to the bar association that were

12 related to the memo.

13 MR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. In answer to

14 your question of how difficult it's going to be to draw

15 the line, I think in most cases it won't be difficult to

16 draw the line. I don't think it was difficult in this

17 case. I'm not aware of any cases that applied principle

18 we advocate where it has been. There may be some cases

19 where it will be difficult to draw the line, but --

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose you have the rule

21 which distinguishes between employment-related and outside

22 speech, under the hypothetical -- difficult hypothetical

23 posed by the Chief Justice, it would be an -- the promise

24 would be an unconstitutional condition, or something like

25 that.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HIMMELFARB: That may --

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I --

3 MR. HIMMELFARB: -- that may -- that may be,

4 Justice Kennedy.

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose it's a hard case --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I suppose that what

7 constitutes a matter of public interest is not the

8 clearest line in the world either, is it?

9 MR. HIMMELFARB: That's absolutely right,

10 Justice Scalia. This Court has already decided that it's

11 important to draw a line at step one in distinguishing

12 between speech on a matter of public concern and speech on

13 a matter of private concern, even though it will often be

14 hard to draw that line. And the reason that line has to

15 be drawn is that the alternative is, in effect, to

16 constitutionalize the law of public employment.

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- let me ask you this

18 -- do you propose drawing the line -- or at least drawing

19 a line in some circumstances this way: That, at step one,

20 if it can be concluded that a private communication

21 between the employer and the employee would have

22 constituted the discharge of the employee's assigned work

23 -- so that it would have been within the scope of his

24 employment, and, therefore, not subject to Pickering

25 balancing, if he had made the statement to the employer --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that, therefore, the statement cannot be regarded as a

2 statement of public interest, even if he had disclosed it

3 publicly, or if he took a further step and went to the bar

4 association and whatnot?

5 MR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Souter, we see these as

6 two separate requirements to get past step one. The

7 speech has to be on a matter of public concern, but it

8 also has to be speech in the speaker's capacity as a

9 citizen.

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if it is within -- I'm

11 sorry, but if it -- if it is within the speaker's assigned

12 duties as an employee, does that preclude a conclusion,

13 later on, that he was speaking as a citizen, even if he

14 goes public with it?

15 MR. HIMMELFARB: I don't think it does, Justice

16 Souter. If --

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, we do have, then, the

18 problem that Justice Stevens has raised.

19 MR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. I don't -- I

20 don't see it as much of a problem, for the reasons I tried

21 to give in responding to Justice Stevens.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the hearing at

23 which this office had testified? I thought that part of

24 the complaint was, "When I spoke at the hearing, I was

25 speaking in a public forum, and they fired me for it."

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HIMMELFARB: May I answer the question?

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

3 MR. HIMMELFARB: My understanding is that that's

4 not part of the complaint, Justice Ginsburg. And my

5 understanding also is that, in the district court,

6 respondent took the position that his testimony at the

7 hearing was in his capacity as an employee.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

9 Himmelfarb.

10 Ms. Robin-Vergeer.

11 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BONNIE L. ROBIN-VERGEER

12 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

13 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may

14 it please the Court:

15 Ever since Pickering, it has been the law that

16 the first amendment protects public employees from being

17 fired or punished for expressing views on matters of

18 public importance where, as here, there is no harm or

19 disruption to their employers. Petitioners in -- the

20 United States asked this Court to scrap that. It is not

21 just the Ninth Circuit.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure that that

24 was clear from the decisions of this Court. Certainly,

25 that wasn't what was involved in Pickering. That was

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 outside speech.

2 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's correct. But it's

3 been the --

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the same -- and the same

5 with Connick. So, I'm -- if you're saying that this is

6 what the circuits have understood, fine, but that's not

7 this -- that's why we took this case.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I think all the cases did

9 say "expressing views as a citizen on a matter of public

10 concern." Wasn't that qualifier always used?

11 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The qualifier has always

12 been used in conjunction with the phase "on matters of

13 public concern."

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, what does it mean? What is

15 -- what is your explanation for that qualifier,

16 "expressing views as a citizen"? Why do we --

17 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: It --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- continually say that?

19 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- it was used descriptively

20 to explain, and especially to look at the context in which

21 the phrase first appears, in Pickering, that public

22 employees, like all citizens, have an interest --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's assume that --

24 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- on matters --

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I think that that's an open

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 question under Pickering, and that this case presents it.

2 Do you -- do you concede -- and maybe you don't -- that

3 there is any category of first amendment speech, as a

4 matter of public concern, which an employee cannot direct

5 to the employer? Are there -- are there some matters as

6 to which the employer can protect its own interests and

7 stifle the employee's speech?

8 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Speaking on a matter of

9 public concern only gets the employee presumptive first-

10 amendment protection.

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, there's always Pickering

12 balance.

13 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: There would be a Pickering

14 balance, yes. And the Pickering balancing test is quite

15 deferential to the employer. The Court observed, in the

16 Pickering case, that it's proper to look -- that a court

17 should look at the proper performance of the employee's

18 daily duties. In Rankin, the Court talked about the

19 questions whether the speech interferes with work,

20 personnel relationships, or the speaker's job performance.

21 The bar is already quite high for the employee,

22 coupled with causation burdens, qualified immunity, and so

23 on. And so, it is not the case that just because a -- an

24 employee speaks on a matter of public concern, that that

25 employee is necessarily going to win a first-amendment

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 case. Also --

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Lee -- Ms. Lee told us

3 that the Ninth Circuit weighed the capacity of the

4 plaintiff as an employee, rather than a member of the

5 public, in favor of the employee and against the employer.

6 Is that how you read the Ninth Circuit's decision?

7 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: No, I think -- it's not

8 quite right. I think the Ninth Circuit just looked at

9 whether his speech which was reporting Government misconduct,

10 a type of speech that the circuit said uniformly recognized

11 was of paramount public importance.

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But --

13 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: And --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- any comment that an

15 employee makes regarding how the office is working is a

16 matter of public concern. I would concede that. I mean

17 --

18 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: With --

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that has to be.

20 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- with respect, I don't --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the consequence of your

22 view is to have the first amendment being used for courts

23 to monitor the discussions that take place in every public

24 agency -- local, State, and Federal -- in the United

25 States. It's -- you are advocating a sweeping rule. Now,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you'll say, "Oh, well, Pickering balance will protect it."

2 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: With --

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I still think the

4 intrusive consequences of your -- of your rule are

5 sweeping.

6 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: With respect, the public-

7 concern threshold is not so easily met. the Court has

8 said --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: I guess our law clerks would

10 meet it every day.

11 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Maybe. Maybe not.

12 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, maybe, maybe not. I

13 don't --

14 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But the Court has --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: -- anything that goes on in my

16 chamber that isn't a matter of public concern, and I would

17 think everything at OSHA and everything at -- look, I'll

18 -- let me put my question to you, because you're going to

19 make an argument that I don't think is too widely shared;

20 namely, that Pickering decides this case. If that's your

21 argument, I'd like to ask you a question based on the

22 assumption Pickering does not decide this case. And it

23 seems to me that Pickering involves a case in which it's

24 both a matter of public concern and outside the scope of

25 employment.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Right.

2 JUSTICE BREYER: And here we have a case that is

3 a matter of public concern, but inside.

4 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Right. I --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: So, in those circumstances, I

6 want to know how you believe the first amendment requires

7 us to decide this case. And as I read this case, in the

8 record, we have one individual, your client, who looked at

9 an affidavit. The affidavit said that the deputy sheriffs

10 were trying to locate where a vehicle that was chocked up

11 came from. They saw tire tracks. The tire tracks went

12 back to a fence at the end of a long driveway.

13 So, I looked in the record. I couldn't find the

14 affidavit. So, I assume that's what it says. And I

15 wanted to know what the deputy sheriff said. What they

16 said is that your client agreed that there were tire

17 tracks. There were tire tracks that did not go the whole

18 length of the driveway, but, rather, tire tracks near the

19 house, where they got the search warrant for. And, they

20 added, that -- the deputies -- that there was rocks broken

21 up.

22 All right. So, we have two sides to this

23 argument: the deputies, who might reasonably contend that

24 they did nothing wrong; your client, who thinks they were

25 lying. And we also have a letter that your client wrote,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 where he said that these deputies are grossly inaccurate

2 and clearly misleading.

3 Suppose his supervisor goes to him and says, "I

4 think that that letter is not the right tone. Maybe

5 you're right, maybe you're wrong; maybe they're in good

6 faith, maybe they're not. And so, if you don't change

7 that tone, I'm going to discipline you." All right?

8 Now, that's my hypothetical, which seemed to me,

9 perhaps, very much like this case. How, in your opinion,

10 does the first amendment handle such a matter?

11 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: If the supervisor told Mr.

12 Ceballos that there was something wrong in the manner in

13 which he conveyed his speech, and told him to revise the

14 memo, that would have been -- he would have been well

15 within his rights to do so. Bear in mind that there's

16 never been an argument here that there was anything

17 inappropriate about Mr. Ceballos's speech, that he

18 exercised poor judgment, that there was anything

19 disruptive about the manner in which he communicated. The

20 head of the office --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I don't under- --

22 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- actually said --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I understand the ultimate

24 answer you gave the hypothetical. I don't understand the

25 principle you're following. I mean, it's a matter of --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: It's --

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you would agree this is a

3 matter of public concern.

4 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: Which is what I'm looking --

6 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes.

7 JUSTICE BREYER: -- for. I'm looking for --

8 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: It is --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- a standard.

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we don't have a standard.

11 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The principle is that an

12 employer -- we agree with the position of the United

13 States, that the employer has the ability to dictate how

14 an employee carries out his duties. In a case where the

15 employee --

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in Justice --

17 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- is insubordinate --

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in Justice Breyer's

19 hypothetical, if the employee filed a lawsuit claiming a

20 violation of his first-amendment rights, you would say

21 that could not be thrown out, on summary judgment, on the

22 ground that the speech was within the scope of his

23 employment.

24 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: It would be not on that

25 ground.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No.

2 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The reason it would be

3 thrown out in summary judgment would be because the

4 employer had a different reason for taking retaliatory

5 action --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no there is --

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that would --

8 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- against the employee.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- be a dispute of fact,

10 so it probably wouldn't -- so it wouldn't be thrown at

11 summary judgment at all.

12 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Virtually all of these cases

13 are able to be disposed of at summary judgment. And you

14 have, basically, 20 years of litigation in the circuit

15 courts to look at where --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: Look --

17 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- the problems that are

18 being posited haven't materialized.

19 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not making my question too

20 clear. I imagine the district judge. I get just the

21 facts I described to you. Your client, who's very upset,

22 says, "This is the most unreasonable thing that ever

23 happened. They were trying to prevent me from

24 communicating with the judge. I'm the one who saw the

25 sheriffs. They didn't." The other side says, "We think

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it's reasonable what we did."

2 My question to you is, What standard does that

3 judge apply under the first amendment? What does he do?

4 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The judge looks first at

5 whether the speech is on a matter of public concern. And

6 if it's a dispute over Government misconduct, it would

7 meet that threshold. Second, the Court would proceed to a

8 Pickering balance and would say the employer's actual

9 reason for retaliating or taking action would be because

10 of the -- you know, the tone or the message or because it

11 was a disagreement, and the supervisor's views ultimately

12 prevail. And so, that's how it would be --

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, the Federal --

14 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- analyzed.

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- Federal courts supervise

16 the constant dialogue that is the everyday routine

17 practice in every governmental agency, local and Federal,

18 in the United States.

19 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: With respect, no. These

20 cases are not that hard to dispose of at summary judgment.

21 Most actions that employers take against the employees

22 are not because of the employees' speech anyway, it's

23 because of how they carry out their job functions.

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that would be something

25 that would have to go to trial, to prove that the -- that

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the employee was incompetent.

2 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Respectfully, I don't -- I

3 don't think that most of these cases -- they don't go to

4 trial, most of them. They're -- of course, there are some

5 trials, but that is not the way most of these cases are

6 handled. And, besides that, adding an extra test, another

7 preliminary hurdle, wouldn't change the litigation burden.

8 Instead of it being the Connick-Pickering test, it would

9 be Connick-Pickering-Ceballos test. And then the question

10 would be, Was the person doing their job? How do you

11 decide that? Is it in his job description? Is it a

12 matter of custom and practice? What if he's doing extra-

13 credit work to build up goodwill with his employer, but

14 it's something that's not --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in --

16 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- ordinarily required?

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in this case, the

18 supervisor said, "There can't be -- can't be tracks on

19 asphalt, so you're probably right." Then he finds out

20 that it's a tire rim, and of course the rim makes a -- so

21 we have to find out this at discovery -- at the discovery

22 stage of a lawsuit?

23 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: As long as he's made an --

24 as long as he's made allegations or spoken in good faith

25 in their -- and it isn't demonstrably false, then he would

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 clear that initial hurdle. And there certainly was

2 nothing suggesting that he spoke in bad faith or was

3 obviously false, whether or not he was correct in his

4 assessment.

5 And it wasn't just an argument over a tire rim.

6 He accused these -- the deputy sheriff here of perjury.

7 It was a quite serious allegation of Government misconduct

8 that was made here, and not, sort of, a mundane dispute

9 over --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why doesn't --

11 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- whether or not --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- why doesn't Rust

13 answer this question? I mean, there, it was really --

14 this issue was just outsourced by the Government. They

15 paid for the speech there, and we said that if you pay the

16 piper, you get to call the tune. And this is just an

17 insourced -- the same question.

18 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Ceballos was not speaking on

19 behalf of the Government when he went to his supervisor.

20 That was an internal communication to his supervisor

21 reporting --

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was writing a memo

23 about why the case should be dismissed. Wasn't --

24 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Right.

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that part of his job?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: It was part of his job,

2 although I -- I'd quibble with the idea that it was

3 required by his job. But it was part of his job. And, in

4 doing so, he spoke to the Government, not as the

5 Government.

6 A better analogy with respect to Rust would be

7 if the doctor in Rust -- let's say it's a doctor at a

8 public university hospital, and the doctor was told that

9 the policy is not to engage in abortion counseling. And

10 he wrote a memo to the supervisor saying, "This is a

11 terribly policy. This is inhibiting our ability to

12 counsel my patients and for me to do my job correctly."

13 That memo would not be the Government's message. And

14 Ceballos's memo here to his supervisor was also not the

15 Government's message.

16 But I want to -- I want to get --

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why is that? In

18 the -- in your hypothetical, the doctor is -- it's not his

19 job to challenge the restriction on the Government grant,

20 but that's what he's doing, so that's not part of his job.

21 Here, it's part of Ceballos's job to explain why the case

22 should be dismissed, and that's what he wrote in his memo.

23 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But this is a very malleable

24 and manipulable concept, what's part of a job. I mean,

25 for a doctor to talk to his supervisor about a restriction

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that he feels is inhibiting his ability to counsel his

2 patients is as much part of his job as a prosecutor going

3 to his supervisor and saying, "There's government

4 misconduct in this case, and we need to do something about

5 it." Just like a teacher in the Givhan case, going to her

6 principal, a conference between a teacher and her

7 principal about whether there's racial -- racially

8 discriminatory practices in the school would be part of a

9 teacher's job, complaining about something that affects

10 her students.

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with your

12 friend's response to that, that in Connick the Court

13 characterized Givhan as involving a case of a citizen

14 complaining about a particular practice?

15 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, I think that

16 underscores the point, that the employee in Givhan was

17 speaking both as an employee and as a citizen, and these

18 roles are not mutually exclusive. You can be both.

19 There's no artificial distinction that the Court has drawn

20 here. And where a Government employee comes forward and

21 reports misconduct and puts himself at risk, he is doing

22 just that, speaking in both capacities. And --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: We just shouldn't have said "as

24 a citizen" in all of these cases. We were just padding

25 our opinion with unnecessary words.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: the Court -- the Court

2 always views the "as a citizen" language in conjunction

3 with the -- speaking on a matter of public concern. And

4 it seems to me that the Court equated the two concepts.

5 But I want to get to why it is unwise and

6 unjustified to draw the per se rule that petitioners are

7 urging here. For one, it essentially means that a public

8 employee such as Ceballos has to go public in order to

9 have presumptive first-amendment protection.

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then he would be

11 violating the internal rules of the workplace.

12 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct.

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where as giving his candid

14 views -- the search warrant -- he's giving his own

15 opinion. But if he goes outside, he is violating a rule

16 of the workplace. And it would seem to me that there are

17 certainly measures could be taken against him for that.

18 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct. It's a trap. They

19 don't tell you about what happened in the second case. If

20 Ceballos had taken suspicions of police misconduct and

21 gone to the Los Angeles Times, they would have fired him.

22 And had he brought a case challenging that termination

23 under the first amendment, he would have lost on under the

24 Pickering balance. The circuit --

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think he should

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 have lost under the Pickering balance, in that case, if he

2 went public right away?

3 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes. If he had evaded

4 proper internal channels of communication, then the

5 employer would be well within his rights to fire him for

6 taking an action that's so disruptive in bringing --

7 discrediting the office without even letting his own

8 employer try to address the situation internally first.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: What if he does let the

10 employer try first, and the employer does nothing, then he

11 goes public? Where does the Pickering balance come out

12 then?

13 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Closer question. I think he

14 probably still loses, but it's a closer question. I

15 think, at some point, if the magnitude of this -- of the

16 problem is so large -- I mean, imagine in the Ramparts

17 scandal situation if -- which has been discussed in the

18 briefs -- if a prosecutor tried to deal with that within

19 the DA's office, and failed to get any response, and then

20 went public with the Ramparts scandal, something of such

21 magnitude, a court perhaps would find their way. But in

22 the --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What --

24 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- individual --

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what you're saying is, is

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that the first amendment has an office and a function

2 within the confines of a Government agency that it doesn't

3 have outside. That's a curious calculus. It seems to me

4 that the first amendment has its most application when you

5 talk to newspapers, when you talk outside. That's what

6 the first amendment's about. The first amendment isn't

7 about policing the workplace.

8 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: the Court held, in both

9 Givhan and Rankin, that private communications on matters

10 of public concern are still protected. And it's -- and

11 there's very good reasons for that to be. I mean, imagine

12 an employee at FEMA who thinks that FEMA is not ready to

13 handle the next hurricane, that it has problems in its

14 disaster preparedness, and so that FEMA employee goes to

15 his supervisor and says, "We have problems here. Here are

16 the four areas in which we're not ready to handle the next

17 hurricane." He gets fired, because the supervisor doesn't

18 want to hear that. It's critically important that public

19 employees who have information, who know what ails the

20 agencies that they work for, be able to find an avenue to

21 communicate issues of public importance. If that FEMA

22 employee had gone --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is any -- is any duty of an

24 employee in a -- an agency devoted to service of the

25 public -- is any of his functions not a matter of public

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 concern?

2 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes. The standard isn't

3 anything of public interest, it's something of legitimate

4 news interest. the Court reiterated that recently in the

5 Roe case. The standard does -- it's not a --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's news. This is a press --

7 a press kind of a test.

8 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Newsworthy. And it's the

9 same test --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Newsworthy.

11 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- the Court has applied in

12 invasion-of-privacy contexts. It's -- although it's a

13 broad standard, but it's also a well-known and well-

14 established standard that --

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that's --

16 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- courts are using --

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what Connick was about,

18 that there are things that are said in the workplace that

19 are of no public interest. They're personal gripes.

20 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct. The line the Court

21 was drawing in Connick was between the personal and the

22 public. the Court said that, had the prosecutor in that

23 case come forward had -- to bring to light actual

24 potential wrongdoing, a breach of public trust, the Court

25 suggested strongly that that would have been a matter of

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 public concern, and that the Court would then --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: So --

3 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- have proceeded to the

4 Pickering balance.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- so if an employee -- I

6 really don't understand it -- an employee comes forward

7 with some scurrilous information about a family member of

8 his boss, who is a public figure, and his whole families

9 are public figures, which would be picked up by the press,

10 that would be a matter of public concern?

11 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: If he's talking --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, I never understood that

13 that's what the test was. I thought this was a matter

14 that deals with the welfare of the public, rather than --

15 rather than the welfare of the press.

16 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Two things. One is that if

17 the public employee is basically reporting something

18 corrupt in the --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that I understand.

20 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- in the workplace.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the welfare of the

22 public.

23 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct. And --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, he's --

25 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- in Government --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- he's just saying, you know,

2 his boss's wife, a mayor of a big city, is running around

3 with somebody. Okay? And that's picked up by the press.

4 It's there on the gossip pages. She's a public figure.

5 You say that would be covered by this.

6 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The test the Court

7 enunciated in Connick is public, social, or -- excuse me

8 -- political, social, or other concerns is up to the

9 community. If it's something that would be of legitimate

10 news and --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Anything that would get in the

12 press. That's it.

13 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Then potentially --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wow.

15 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But it has to be legitimate

16 news interest. And the Court -- the Courts have not

17 usually taken idle gossip to meet that test.

18 JUSTICE BREYER: We live in a world where people

19 are leaking things all the time. And there are thousands

20 of things that are in the public interest every day. But

21 what's bothering me is, while I see the Government's rule

22 as protecting the interests of the employer, it's very

23 hard for me to believe that never is there an instance

24 where the first amendment offers protection. But the only

25 choice you've given me is a rule that says every dispute

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of the public interest is going to go right into

2 constitutional litigation. And I don't like that either.

3 So, am I hopelessly --

4 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: No.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: -- forced to choose which is

6 the lesser of the evils, or is there some middle approach

7 that gives discretion to the Government, but doesn't allow

8 them to exceed that discretion in a certain category of

9 cases? If so, what? And --

10 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Certainly --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: -- how would you phrase it?

12 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- at a minimum, a report of

13 Government misconduct by an employee to his supervisor, at

14 a minimum, should be treated as meeting whatever threshold

15 the Court establishes. And there's something that all the

16 all circuits that have addressed this point agree, that

17 whistleblower-types of speech is of paramount public --

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, we do this --

19 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- concern.

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- so we do this as a -- so we

21 do this as a matter of what is sound management principles

22 for a Government agency? How does that relate to the

23 first amendment?

24 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Because Government

25 misconduct goes to the very heart of Government

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 accountability and the public's ability to hold officials

2 accountable when there is --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Government

4 misconduct -- if I get a memo from a law clerk that says,

5 "Justice So-and-So's jurisprudence is wacky," that goes to

6 --

7 [Laughter.]

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that goes to

9 Government misconduct, under your theory, right? And I

10 fire them, because I think that's not appropriate to put

11 in a memo.

12 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But if --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They have a first-

14 amendment claim, right?

15 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, they have a first-

16 amendment interest in their speech, but they have no

17 claim, because if the -- if you fired them just because --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Nobody's wacko here. I mean,

19 it's plainly --

20 [Laughter.]

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- plainly false.

22 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: You know, it would depend

23 why -- it would depend why you fired them.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they disagree with

25 it. They think it's -- whatever -- unprincipled, wrong.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 They write me a memo, and I say, "Don't write me a memo

2 like that." And they write me another one, and then I

3 fire them.

4 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: All right. But if you're

5 firing them because you think they've exercised poor

6 judgment in the -- in the way that they've communicated,

7 then it's --

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they think it's

9 Government misconduct because of the way cases are

10 decided, and that they have a first amendment interest.

11 What could be more important than how the Court decides

12 cases? And that violates their first-amendment rights.

13 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: In the hypothetical you gave

14 me, it doesn't -- I mean, it doesn't sound like a serious

15 claim of Government misconduct. It sounds like more like

16 an offhand remark with -- which, if you thought it was

17 inappropriate, you might be able to take action against

18 that employee. Here, we have a very grave allegation to

19 public -- of Government misconduct, not casually made. I

20 mean, the -- Mr. Ceballos talked to --

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there was --

22 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- other people --

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- a dispute about that

24 in this case, too. I mean, it -- under the supervisor's

25 view, it may come down to simply whether there were tire

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 tracks or tire rim tracks. And that's not as serious, in

2 one view, as your client thinks it's serious.

3 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: My client carefully

4 considered what the -- what the allegations were in the

5 case, and they talked to people in this office. So

6 seriously did the supervisors take it that they actually

7 released somebody who pleaded guilty, who was in custody

8 for seven months, and let them out on their own

9 recognizance, because that's how seriously -- what a

10 problem they thought, in his office, they had with this --

11 the affidavit. It was only after the meeting with the

12 sheriff's department where they, kind of, launched into

13 him exactly like a public defender, did the tide turn.

14 So, we're not -- it's not a casual dispute over tire

15 tracks, or not tire tracks, in this case.

16 But getting back to Justice Breyer's question

17 about drawing lines, I think that's just --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Your answer to Justice Breyer's

19 -- I was just going to jump in there -- your answer to

20 Justice Breyer's question is, look at -- if you want to be

21 sure that, in every case, you know, the good cases fall on

22 this side, the bad cases fall on -- he should buy your

23 position that every case should go to a balancing test.

24 That will give you the perfection of first-amendment

25 application. The absolute perfection. Now, it'll cost a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

54
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 lot of money, and it'll, you know, interfere with a lot of

2 employment things, but it will give you first-amendment

3 perfection. Right? I mean, that's the answer.

4 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: There's an -- with respect,

5 I think there's --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that your answer?

7 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I'm not sure I can answer

8 that.

9 [Laughter.]

10 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I'll take that as a

11 rhetorical question.

12 But, to get back to Justice Breyer's question,

13 there's also -- I think this came up in -- when my

14 opposing counsel was talking, that there's this extra element

15 present here, which is that there is an independent

16 constitutional problem here, in that when you have a --

17 police misconduct, you have someone whose right to fair

18 trial are at stake, and you have a prosecutor who's trying

19 to fulfill his individual ethical and constitutional

20 obligation --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that --

22 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- on top of it.

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There would -- in this case,

24 unlike any other case I've seen in the employment area,

25 there is a hearing in -- before a court of general

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

55
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 jurisdiction, who goes into this. That's what the

2 criminal trial is for. And he did. There was also a

3 grievance proceeding.

4 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Had Ceballos remained

5 silent, however, then this speech would never have been

6 aired, and police misconduct --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: All right --

8 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- would go unchecked.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I've got -- you've got me

10 part of the way. Now, I'm not saying I -- I have to think

11 this through, but you got part of the way. You say here,

12 there's an independent constitutional basis for the speech

13 being permitted. But, now, still within that, the

14 Government agency has to have some authority to discipline

15 a person, even there, because, after all, he might have

16 been accusing these sheriffs of things that were really

17 not justified by what they, in fact, did. Or maybe he was

18 right. What about that part of the standard? Do you want

19 to say that the Government wins, as long as it behaved

20 reasonably? Do you want to say that the Government loses

21 only if there was an abuse of ordinary employer

22 discretion? Do you want to say the Government -- et

23 cetera. What do you want to say?

24 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: If the Government takes

25 action because the employee has exercised -- has done --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

56
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 carried out his job in an inappropriate way that reflects

2 a lack of fitness or poor judgment and what have you, the

3 employer's within his rights to do so. The Court

4 acknowledged that in Pickering, it acknowledged that in

5 Rankin. That has never really been an issue in the

6 Court's cases. And it's not --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Suppose --

8 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- our position --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- we were to write this,

10 hypothetically. Indeed, the employer has broad discretion

11 to discipline the employee for the manner -- or whatever

12 he does -- even in such an area, but that discretion can

13 be abused. And, therefore, it is up to the judge to

14 determine whether a jury could find such abuse of

15 discretion here.

16 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct. I agree with that

17 standard.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that does --

19 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that does mean that

21 potentially -- as the Government says, potentially every

22 case is at least going to get as far as summary judgment

23 in court.

24 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's already the case.

25 Almost all these cases go to summary judgment. It's

57

1 almost impossible to dismiss one of these cases on the

2 pleadings. That's true even in the Fourth Circuit.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you -- it wouldn't be

4 that way if the rule was that if it's employee speech on

5 the job, it's not protected at all.

6 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Respectfully, that's not

7 correct. Even in the fourth circuit --

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, that's the argument

9 that's being made here by both the --

10 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I understand that, but that

11 argument is unfounded. Even in the fourth circuit, which

12 has come closest to adopting the per-se rule the

13 petitioners are asking for, district courts -- and there's

14 a case we cited in our brief, Echtenkamp -- it's from the

15 eastern district of Virginia -- where the Court said, in

16 trying to decide, "Did the employee speak as a citizen or

17 as an employee?" this is going to take factual

18 development. We can't decide this on the pleadings. It's

19 going to --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, do --

21 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- have to go to summary

22 judgment.

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- do we know how many cases of

24 this sort there are?

25 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I can only say based looking

1 at published cases --

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.

3 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- on Westlaw.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.

5 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: There seem to be around 60

6 or 70 court-of-appeals cases --

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Over what --

8 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- a year.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- period of time?

10 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Each year, for the least

11 five years, about --

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: In --

13 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- 60 or 70 court-of-appeals

14 cases.

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- in all of the circuits --

16 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: In all of the circuits.

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that follow a ninth-circuit

18 kind of rule?

19 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes, in all of the circuits.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's court of appeals. You

21 really don't know how many district-court judgments there

22 may have been that didn't go up to the court.

23 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: There's around a hundred a

24 year in the district courts that appear on Westlaw, each

25 year for the last five years.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's one aspect of this

2 case that no one has touched on. The concurring judge,

3 Judge O'Scannlain, said, this is what whistleblower

4 statutes are supposed to handle, and that if we accepted

5 your view of the first-amendment coverage, the

6 whistleblower statutes would be superfluous.

7 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's incorrect. The

8 whistleblower statutes, which are sort of a patchwork

9 nationwide, protect, or at least they have the ability to

10 protect, speech beyond what the first amendment does. If

11 you take the Federal whistleblower protection statute, for

12 example, if an employee makes a protected disclosure, and

13 an employer takes a prohibited action in response, there's

14 no balancing. The employee wins. The causation burden is

15 also lower. The agency's on the hook for paying the

16 money. There's no immunity, and so on.

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: California does have a

18 whistleblower statute. Is that right?

19 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: It does.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And there was a claim made

21 under it, but we're not told how it came out.

22 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: There wasn't a claim made

23 under it.

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was not.

25 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: There was not a --

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I'm --

2 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- did not bring a claim

3 under California whistle-blowing --

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He did -- he --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure you've answered

6 Justice Ginsburg's question. Her question was, Don't

7 whistleblower statutes cover this? And your answer, if I

8 understood it correctly, is, whistleblower statutes cover

9 this, and a lot more. That doesn't prove --

10 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Oh, I'm sorry, I --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that doesn't prove--

12 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- understood the question

13 --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that they don't take care of

15 this problem.

16 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: No, I understood her

17 question to be whether they're rendered superfluous.

18 Whistleblower statutes are patchwork across the country.

19 Some would cover this kind of speech, some would not.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Some would not cover it.

21 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Not all whistleblower

22 statutes cover internal communications. Some do --

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Some are quite narrow --

24 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- some don't

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- of what they cover.

1 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I'm sorry?

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Some of the whistleblower

3 statutes are very specific and narrow --

4 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes.

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- of what they cover.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Some of them --

7 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in fact, don't cover

9 disclosures that are job related. If it's the employee's

10 job to blow the whistle on this type of thing, it's

11 usually not covered by a whistleblower statute.

12 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, no, that's not --

13 that's not correct. I mean, in -- many of the statutes do

14 cover internal, and some don't. In some, you have to go

15 to a legislature, or you have to go -- take it to a

16 certain outside organization or entity in order to cover

17 it, and --

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I'm --

19 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- some internal --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- thinking of the

21 Federal law, where the idea is, if it's part of your job,

22 you have the normal civil-service job protections if

23 you're being retaliated or discriminated against for doing

24 your job, so you don't get the extra protections of the

25 whistleblower law. The only people who get it are the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

62
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 people who -- it is not part of their job.

2 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The Federal circuit has

3 interpreted the Federal whistleblower statute to narrow

4 the protection, so if it's within your normal duties of

5 employment, then it would excluded.

6 But if I could -- if I can -- just for a moment,

7 I want to return -- I've hinted -- I've hinted at this

8 somewhat, but I haven't -- oh, I see my time's up.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah. Thank you, Ms.

10 Robin-Vergeer.

11 MS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Thank you.

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Lee, you have one

13 minute left.

14 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CINDY S. LEE

15 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

16 MS. LEE: Under our approach, we believe that

17 many cases won't even be filed, because they won't be able

18 to make a colorable claim that it is citizen speech. This

19 case, in its essence, is about whether a public employee

20 has a constitutional right to perform his assigned job

21 duties in such a way that is to the dissatisfaction of the

22 employer. In Pickering and in Connick, this Court

23 contemplated first-amendment litigation in a public-

24 employment context in the relatively rare circumstances in

25 which adverse employment action was taken as a result of

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

63
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 an employee's extracurricular activities. Under the Ninth

2 Circuit and the respondent's approach, the exception would

3 become the rule.

4 It is our view that the Ninth Circuit has simply

5 gone too far in giving a broad sweep for first-amendment

6 protection for any public employee speech, simply because

7 it happens to be a matter of public concern. As Judge

8 O'Scannlain stated in his special concurring opinion, "The

9 time is right for this Court to steer the drifting first-

10 amendment jurisprudence back to its proper moorings."

11 Thank you.

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Lee.

13 The case is submitted.

14 [Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the

15 above-entitled matter was submitted.]
