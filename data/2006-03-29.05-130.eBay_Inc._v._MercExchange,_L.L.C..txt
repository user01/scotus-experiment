3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

5 Mr. Phillips.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

9 and may it please the Court:

10 The fundamental question that's posed in this

11 particular case is whether or not the court of appeals

12 by adopting a rule that declares categorically that

13 three out of the four traditional factors for deciding

14 whether or not to grant permanent injunctive relief

15 will be irrebuttably presumed to be satisfied whenever

16 a jury has found that a patent is valid and has been

17 infringed.

18 The rule in the Federal Circuit for at least

19 20 years has been that if you have validity and

20 infringement decided by the jury, that then there is

21 irrebuttable finding of -- of irreparable injury, of

22 inadequate remedy at law, and that the balance of harms

23 decidedly favors the plaintiff, and that the only issue

24 that remains available to the defendant in that

25 circumstance is a heightened scrutiny on the standard

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of whether or not the -- the public interest commands

2 that an injunction be denied in a particular case. And

3 even in that context, the Federal Circuit's rule is

4 extraordinarily stringent because not just any public

5 interest can -- will satisfy, but instead, it has to be

6 a public interest that endangers the public health.

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that all in Judge

8 Bryson's decision? I certainly didn't see it there.

9 MR. PHILLIPS: That -- that is precise -- I

10 think it's the only way to read Judge Bryson's

11 decision, Justice Ginsburg, where the court says, at

12 page 26a, that a permanent injunction will issue once

13 infringement and validity have been adjudged, and then

14 say, to be sure, it will not be so to protect the

15 public interest. And we all know the traditional rule

16 with respect to the grant of injunctive relief is that

17 it's a four-factor test.

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't see anything

19 about irrebuttable presumption.

20 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the point is that if an

21 injunction follows with a finding of -- of validity and

22 infringement, then that means that there has to be --

23 there has to be irreparable injury, inadequate remedy

24 at law, and that the balance of hardships has to tilt

25 in -- in favor of the plaintiff. And then the only

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 issue that remains is whether or not the public

2 interest justifies not granting an injunction under the

3 circumstances of this case. It seems to me there's no

4 other way to read that.

5 And if you read it in the context of the --

6 of the previous 20 years of decisions from the Federal

7 Circuit, it is absolutely clear. We don't have the

8 opportunity to come back as a defendant in an

9 infringement action and say, Your Honor, in the

10 specific facts of this case, this is someone for whom

11 money damages is a completely adequate remedy.

12 And -- and it seems to me quite clear that

13 section 283 is designed to be exactly the opposite of

14 the way the Federal Circuit has interpreted this --

15 this scheme. Section 283 says explicitly -- and this

16 is at page 1 of the blue brief -- district courts,

17 quote, may -- not shall -- grant injunctions in

18 accordance with principles of equity. And principles

19 of equity, as Justice Story said almost 200 years ago,

20 systematically reject the idea that you will act on a

21 categorical basis in deciding whether or not to grant

22 or withdraw the injunctive relief in -- in particular

23 circumstances. And to the contrary, you have to look

24 at each specific issue.

25 And in that regard --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is that so with --

2 with respect to someone else's use of -- of your

3 property? It seems to me very rare where -- where

4 someone takes your property, that the court wouldn't --

5 wouldn't give you the property back and -- and simply

6 say, you know -- I can think of a few extraordinary

7 examples. If somebody makes a statue out of stolen

8 gold, you know, the -- the old classic, I guess you'd

9 get the money back. But ordinarily we're talking about

10 a property right here, and -- and the property right is

11 -- is explicitly the right to exclude others from --

12 from use of that. That's what the patent right is.

13 And all he's asking for is give me my property back.

14 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And -- and Congress

15 already made the -- the balance, Justice Scalia, with

16 respect to that because Congress obviously identified

17 the property right as the right to exclude. And then

18 Congress did not confer upon the district courts no

19 discretion to act in -- in a situation where the

20 property right has been violated. Instead, Congress

21 expressly adopts in 283 a very broad grant of equitable

22 discretion. To be sure, in the ordinary case, you --

23 you very well may have irreparable injury proved, but

24 the question is, do you -- do you eliminate any inquiry

25 and any specific facts of the case and instead not only

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 presume it, which I think is a mistake, although the

2 district court did that and found that in this case the

3 presumption was rebutted, but to -- but to say

4 irrebuttably it's presumed that you have irreparable

5 injury, irrebuttably presumed that you don't have an

6 adequate remedy at law, and irrebuttably presume that

7 the balance of equities tilt in favor of the plaintiff.

8 And that, it seems to me, cannot be squared with the

9 language of the statute.

10 And, indeed, on that score, the United States

11 sort of magically ends up on our side of the -- of the

12 table because the United States says the same thing.

13 There is no way --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: On Justice Scalia's

15 question, I was trying to think of some, and I was

16 trying to think the analogy might -- you might find

17 some analogy in the public utilities field, the -- or a

18 ferris wheel or something. What you want is a person

19 who uses his property not at all himself, but licensed

20 the public generally. And now would a -- would a court

21 issue an injunction there? And as I think about that,

22 I don't realize I don't know the answer.

23 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know of any. I mean,

24 I certainly wouldn't categorically declare that you

25 have to I guess is the way I would respond to that.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's what -- I mean,

2 that -- that's what you're trying to analogize this

3 case to, I guess, is a person who licenses others to

4 use his property and never uses it himself.

5 MR. PHILLIPS: That's precisely what this

6 case involves.

7 JUSTICE BREYER: And there, I don't know how

8 courts do normally act in other areas of property law.

9 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know that there

10 are a whole lot of them like that, but the one thing

11 that -- I mean, there are two things to think about the

12 property concept in the statute.

13 First of all, Congress does not declare that

14 the property interest here is a real property interest,

15 which traditionally has been protected differently.

16 It's a personal property interest, which is

17 traditionally given -- accorded less protection under

18 this kind of a scheme. And so there -- and -- and

19 again, Congress in any event struck the balance. It

20 didn't say, as it could have, that there is presumed --

21 there's a presumption that we have an injunction. It

22 didn't say, as it could have, that we shall have a --

23 shall have either a presumption or an injunction in any

24 particular case. And so under the statutory scheme

25 here, it seems to --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but -- but the

2 exercise of discretion is channeled over time, as -- as

3 judges apply it in -- in similar cases. You're not

4 suggesting that in a typical run-of-the-mine patent

5 case, no special considerations, it would be wrong to

6 say that in those cases you typically would grant an

7 injunction?

8 MR. PHILLIPS: I think in those cases, the

9 irreparable injury and the inadequacy of the remedy at

10 law will be -- will be easy to demonstrate, as they

11 have been for hundreds of years.

12 The -- the fundamental difference -- this is

13 important to have this in mind. The Federal Circuit

14 adopted this rule of law some 20 years ago. That's

15 before the high-tech boom, before the explosion in the

16 number of patents. And so the opportunity to deal with

17 these issues on an individualized basis that might give

18 rise to some kinds of rules that you could, in fact,

19 apply to the generality of cases based on an experience

20 has never been there. We have been dealing with an

21 irrebuttable presumption for 20 years in a way that has

22 -- has completely stultified the ability to develop any

23 of those kinds of rules.

24 And what we're asking this Court to do at

25 this point is to say, no, enough is enough. We need to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 go back to a time where the -- go back to the language

2 of the statute, confer the discretion on the district

3 courts.

4 And it's important not just for a case like

5 this one, but it -- but it distorts tremendously the

6 settlement value and the process and the relationship

7 between the patent holder and all of the potential

8 licensees because we're in a -- in a world -- and I

9 don't think the Court can ignore this because it's in

10 the amicus briefs. We're in a world where if a patent

11 holder files a lawsuit in Marshall, Texas, no patent

12 has ever been declared invalid in that jurisdiction,

13 and no patent has ever been found not to infringe.

14 And then you take that finding automatically and you

15 turn it into an injunction. Any person who has been

16 threatened under those circumstances and told that

17 we're going to face a lawsuit in Marshall, Texas is

18 going to have a very different negotiating posture than

19 in a situation where --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, I mean, that's --

21 that's a problem with Marshall, Texas, not with the

22 patent law. I mean, maybe -- maybe we should remedy

23 that problem.

24 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I hope you do.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: But I don't think we should

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 write -- write our patent law because we have some

2 renegade jurisdictions.

3 Why -- why isn't the -- the free market

4 normally adequate to solve any problems you're talking

5 about? Everybody is in this for the money. Nobody is

6 going to hold off giving the license beyond the point

7 where -- where it makes financial sense.

8 MR. PHILLIPS: Well --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why can't -- why can't we

10 let the market take care of the problem?

11 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the -- the

12 market will take care of the problem. The question is

13 under what standards are you going to apply. Are you

14 going to say that there is no effective check on the

15 jury system, that it goes automatically from a jury's

16 finding to injunctive relief, or are you going to

17 implement it against the backdrop of what Congress

18 specifically provides, which is that the district

19 courts should exercise equitable discretion in deciding

20 how best to proceed.

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the problems with

22 the district court exercising equitable discretion

23 without a close review by the Federal Circuit is just

24 the thing that the Federal Circuit was created to

25 handle, that is, you get a tremendous disparity among

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 district judges. I don't know that it's only in

2 Marshall, Texas that you have a tilt in one direction

3 or in the other. So the Federal Circuit is put there

4 not to say that the district judges have no discretion,

5 but to try to rein it in somewhat so that you won't

6 have wide disparities, which you very well might have

7 if you just say discretion to the district judges and

8 very light review on appeal.

9 MR. PHILLIPS: But, Justice Ginsburg, the --

10 the problem with that is that that's not the scheme

11 that Congress created with respect to the remedial

12 aspects of -- of the patent laws. I mean, it is surely

13 the case that Congress meant, as -- as substantive

14 patent law is generally enforced and implemented, that

15 the Federal Circuit would play a significant role in

16 ensuring some kind of uniformity, but Congress didn't

17 then go the extra step and say, and when it comes time

18 to decide whether or not injunctive relief ought to be

19 granted, that it will -- that we will presume it or

20 that we will deal with it in a categorical way.

21 Congress granted that discretion to the district courts

22 and with good reason because district --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think maybe you exaggerate

24 the -- the extent of equitable discretion. I mean, it

25 wasn't as though it's just left up to the judge, seems

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 like a good idea or not a good idea. There are a lot

2 of rules for when -- when you would give injunctive

3 relief and not. And -- and I -- you know, I'm not sure

4 you're going to get into the kind of wide-ranging

5 allowance that -- that you seem to be arguing for.

6 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know that I need

7 a wide-ranging allowance with respect to this. What I

8 need is elimination of the irrebuttable presumption

9 that doesn't allow any consideration of whether money

10 damages are adequate in a particular case.

11 And -- and here, it's very important to

12 focus. The -- the district judge didn't just say, I

13 woke up this morning and I felt really good about the

14 defendant, and therefore, I'm not granting an

15 injunction. The district court here said, I'm making

16 specific findings of fact with regard to the adequacy

17 of money damages to deal --

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but he said

19 other things too, and one thing he said is, I don't

20 like business method patents very much, and so I'm not

21 going to give an injunction here.

22 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's --

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that was

24 proper or improper?

25 MR. PHILLIPS: That's -- that's not precisely

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 what he said, Mr. Chief Justice. What he said was that

2 business method patents stand on a somewhat different

3 footing because they're subject --

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He said there's a

5 growing concern over the issuance of business method

6 patents.

7 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that an

9 appropriate consideration to take into account in

10 determining whether to grant an injunction or not?

11 MR. PHILLIPS: I think probably, at the end

12 of the day, it wouldn't be, but the bottom line is that

13 he did that in the context of analyzing the public

14 interest consideration and he said that didn't --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then he went on

16 and he said --

17 MR. PHILLIPS: -- tilt in favor.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- another -- another

19 consideration is that this patentee does not practice

20 its patents. But, I mean, isn't that just saying he's,

21 you know, the -- the guy in the garage and he's an

22 inventor and the way he's going to market his

23 discoveries is by getting some firm that basically

24 speculates on patents.

25 MR. PHILLIPS: Sure. And --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if he's denying

2 that inventor, you know, the -- what he'd give to Bell

3 Labs -- or whatever Bell Labs is these days -- that

4 does practice the inventions --

5 MR. PHILLIPS: I should know that actually,

6 but --

7 (Laughter.)

8 MR. PHILLIPS: But, Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I

9 think you can -- it's -- it's not fair to pick apart

10 each one of his findings and say does that finding good

11 enough or is that finding enough.

12 The truth is the district court made a series

13 of four findings that overlap, and one of which was,

14 obviously, he doesn't -- he doesn't practice this

15 patent. He also doesn't effectively license. He's

16 willing to license his patent to eBay. He's willing to

17 license this patent to anybody under these

18 circumstances.

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but --

20 MR. PHILLIPS: And candidly, most of the

21 licensing arrangements don't even exist, and they're --

22 I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I interrupted

24 you.

25 But the -- the business process point you

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 give away fairly quickly. I -- I thought that was

2 rather substantial. The whole point is, is that a

3 business process patent is -- is difficult to define

4 and could be very -- it can be very restrictive.

5 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I think in -- in a proper

6 case -- and I don't think you do it under the --

7 under the public interest analysis. I think you'd

8 probably end up doing it under the balance of the

9 hardships. But in any event -- and -- and what you --

10 you know, obviously, this case is -- is more

11 complicated because --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: My concern is if you take

13 that away, I don't know if you've got a lot left for

14 the -- saying no injunction in this case.

15 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I mean, there's

16 plenty left because he doesn't practice this invention.

17 He has no intention of practicing this invention

18 beyond the receipt of money. Money damages are a

19 completely adequate remedy under these particular

20 circumstances, given -- given especially the fact that

21 if -- if the infringement continues -- and remember,

22 this is not a situation where he proposes to continue

23 to infringe. We propose to work around it, but if the

24 infringement continues, we're then subject to enhanced

25 damages and all of the deterrent power that that has,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 plus the possibility, obviously, down the road that the

2 district court could, on a rule 54 motion, now come

3 back and say, well, no, now I've decided that

4 injunctive relief is warranted under these

5 circumstances.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, isn't it a concern

7 that Congress didn't provide for compulsory licensing

8 which this seems to have a very strong resemblance to?

9 It says eBay wants to do this, so they're going to

10 have to pay for it, but the patentee can't stop them.

11 It just has -- in effect, has to license them to do it.

12 MR. PHILLIPS: But -- but we're not asking

13 for a compulsory license because it is not our

14 intention, going forward, to infringe this patent.

15 We've made it very clear to the district court and the

16 district court recognizes that we not only intend to

17 but have, in fact, implemented a design-around or a

18 work-around to this particular patent. And that's what

19 we expect will happen. So we're not asking for the

20 right to continue to infringe and a willingness to

21 pay as we go.

22 Our concern -- and this does go to the

23 business method patent because it does go to the -- to

24 the uncertainty. The problem we have here is we don't

25 know where the line is going to be drawn. That's why

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the district court said specifically, you know, there's

2 going to be unending litigation on this because it's

3 very difficult to define the metes and bounds of this

4 particular patent, and we're going to have to fight

5 over that, so that the traditional reason for

6 injunctive relief, which is to bring peace, isn't

7 available in this case. We're not going to have peace

8 under these circumstances.

9 And when you have that situation and you have

10 the kind of uncertainty, not because of business method

11 patents generally -- that's -- that's where I was I

12 think probably giving up too much immediately. I don't

13 think the fact of a business method patent is per se a

14 problem, but I think analyzing the specific business

15 method patent and its uncertainty is a legitimate

16 consideration for the district court to take into

17 account in deciding whether or not, in a particular

18 circumstance, we are better off saying, pay the

19 plaintiff the money for the past injury, let's see how

20 the work-around develops, and take it into account, but

21 without the sort of --

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, tell me how

23 -- how this works. It seems to me that an injunctive

24 hearing is -- might be the cheapest, most effective way

25 to -- to sort out whether there's going to be a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 violation. You call the parties in and they indicate

2 what -- what they propose to do, and the judge says,

3 well, this is within it or it's without it. It's --

4 it's much cheaper than a -- a new lawsuit.

5 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, of course, the

6 consequences of the -- of the process are significantly

7 different because, obviously, the remedies for -- for

8 contempt are significantly more draconian than -- than

9 just a finding of a -- of a violation.

10 But more -- more important than that, Justice

11 Kennedy --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but this gives you

13 the advantage of coming in in advance saying, I want --

14 I -- I want a ruling in advance that I'm not going to

15 violate the injunction. You've got a cheap lawsuit.

16 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, and the reality is the

17 district court already looked at this and said that it

18 -- it is the district court's judgment that they're

19 going to require full infringement trials. I mean,

20 that was the finding it made with respect to the

21 balance of hardships. And -- and neither the court of

22 appeals nor the -- nor the Respondent in this case has

23 -- has challenged that particular finding. So the

24 reality is the district court has made the

25 determination that that's not -- that process is either

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 not available or not practical in the context of this

2 particular case, which of course, goes back to why it's

3 important to make sure that you look at each of these

4 cases on their individual facts rather than across the

5 board on a -- on these -- on an irrebuttable

6 presumption basis.

7 The -- the additional point that I think it's

8 important I at least spend a minute on, because the

9 Court asked for us to deal with Continental Paper Bag,

10 is that it does seem to me quite clear that, at least

11 at this stage, the parties are pretty much in sync,

12 that -- that the Court need not revisit Continental

13 Paper Bag. The holding in that case is actually almost

14 a sort of quintessential situation where you have two

15 participants in the market, one of whom would like to

16 take advantage of a patent that will improve that

17 participant's ability to produce a product. The patent

18 holder is not ready yet to develop that product using

19 that particular method and, therefore, sues to stop his

20 competitor from entering into that market. I mean,

21 that's the classic kind of situation where you have a

22 -- you know, where you -- where you've got the

23 potential infringer is looking at what's going on and

24 making a decision and copying it and then trying to

25 implement it. And the Court said, under those

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 circumstances, you get an injunction.

2 But here, of course, we're dealing with a

3 vastly different situation, as we -- as we point out

4 that -- in our brief, where the -- at page 9 where the

5 district court specifically found that not any of

6 eBay's success is attributable to anything in the

7 patents of the plaintiff in this case and that nothing

8 in the patents that were put forward by the plaintiff

9 in this case provide any basis on which anyone could

10 build a business model. So this is, to my mind, the

11 antithesis of the situation in Continental Paper Bag.

12 But in any event, the holding there is

13 clearly not implicated here. It's been codified by

14 Congress. There's no basis for the Court to reconsider

15 it.

16 To the extent that there is -- is dicta in

17 there that talks about the right to exclude, Justice

18 Scalia, I think, in general, the right to exclude is

19 one that you do, in fact, enforce with injunctive

20 relief in many cases, but the question here is whether

21 or not the Federal Circuit should have adopted a rule

22 that says you -- you enforce it in every case

23 irrebuttably as to three of the four factors, and as to

24 the fourth factor, you don't go any further than

25 requiring the plaintiff to show that there's a -- an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 imminent public health crisis.

2 Under those circumstances, it seems to me the

3 Court should reverse the court of appeals. And,

4 indeed, if there were ever a case in which the Court

5 ought to uphold the district court on a -- under the

6 abuse of discretion standard, it is this case.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why should we -- if I

8 can get back to one of the factors. Why should we draw

9 a distinction between the -- the sole inventor who

10 needs a patent speculation firm to market his discovery

11 and -- and somebody else? Why -- why should he lose

12 the leverage of the normal injunction and have

13 substituted for that a duel of experts over what a

14 reasonable royalty should be?

15 MR. PHILLIPS: Because the -- because

16 Congress didn't dictate that he gets that leverage in

17 every situation. And -- and it's quite possible that

18 the -- there are going to be a lot of situations. And

19 the Solicitor General's brief identifies four of them

20 in which an inventor, who doesn't plan to practice the

21 invention, engages in -- in various kinds of licensing

22 schemes that create all kinds of interrelationships

23 among the way the patent is going to be developed, and

24 I think all of those are perfectly legitimate and could

25 easily justify injunctive relief in precisely the kind

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of case that you pose, Mr. Chief Justice. But that's

2 not this case.

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I -- maybe I

4 don't understand what it means to practice the

5 invention. If -- if I -- does that -- if -- if I

6 invent something, you know, a new -- better way to make

7 a car engine work and I want to sell that to somebody,

8 that's -- you'd say that's not practicing the invention

9 because I don't build cars?

10 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But again, you've

11 licensed it and there are certain rights that,

12 obviously, arise out of the licensing. None of these

13 factors is alone, I don't believe, sufficient to say

14 you don't get injunctive relief. But I think what the

15 district court said, and I think that this is why the

16 Court ought to affirm the district court's under --

17 under an abuse of discretion standard, which never been

18 applied to this case -- what the Court should say is,

19 look, and where you have no practicing of the invention

20 by the inventor, where you have a complete willingness

21 to license not only to the world, but also to eBay

22 specifically, and where you've never sought preliminary

23 injunctive relief, under all of those -- and where --

24 and where there's serious question about the lines to

25 be drawn, there's no benefit to be had by -- in the way

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of trying to eliminate the amount of litigation on an

2 ongoing basis, under all of those circumstances, all of

3 which the district court identified, then it's not

4 appropriate to grant injunctive relief. We'll allow

5 enhanced damages in the interim and even the potential

6 down the road, obviously, of -- of an injunction to

7 serve as enough of a deterrent to protect the right to

8 exclude that the plaintiff has under the statute.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why does the fact

10 that -- that you're not practicing the invention make a

11 difference? I mean, why -- why should I be in better

12 shape, as far as getting an injunction is concerned, if

13 I produce an automobile engine and -- and make some

14 undeterminate profit --

15 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- from the use of this

17 particular invention in the engine than I would be if I

18 licensed it with a royalty based upon the number of

19 sales of engines? I mean, they're both risking, you

20 know, the same future use of the -- of the device. Why

21 -- why does one situation justify an injunction more

22 than the other?

23 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I think -- I think I

24 ought to modify it slightly because it's not just

25 simply that you don't practice the invention. It's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that you're not in the market itself because that's --

2 that's the Continental Paper Bag case. You know, in

3 Continental Paper Bag, they don't want to -- they don't

4 want to practice the invention either because they want

5 to hold it back in order to be able effectively to use

6 it. If they had wanted to license it, that would have

7 made sense too.

8 But this is not a competitor in the market.

9 If they were a -- it seems to me you have a much better

10 claim to a need to occupy space. That's what the

11 injunction is trying to say. This is my space. I want

12 to occupy it. But if you choose not to occupy it, it's

13 not to say that you abandon your right to an

14 injunction, but that that ought to be a legitimate,

15 individualized consideration, among other

16 considerations --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: By not occupying it, you

18 mean including not licensing it to somebody else.

19 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, if you didn't license it

20 -- and actually we have no relevant licenses here too

21 -- that would be another factor that ought to be --

22 that ought to count in the mix. Again, it's not -- I'm

23 not looking for a presumption the other way and I'm not

24 looking for categorical rules that say that if you --

25 if you're a nonperforming entity, that you don't get a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 license, or even if you're a troll, as that term gets

2 bandied around, that you're never entitled to a -- to

3 an injunction.

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is -- is the troll

5 the scary thing under the bridge, or is it a fishing

6 technique? I -- I want --

7 (Laughter.)

8 MR. PHILLIPS: For my clients, it's been the

9 scary thing under the bridge, but --

10 (Laughter.)

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, is that what the

12 troll is?

13 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I believe that's the -- I

14 think that's what -- what it is, although you -- maybe

15 we should think of it more as Orks, now that we have a

16 new generation, but at this point troll is the word

17 that gets -- that gets used.

18 If there are no further questions, I'd like

19 to reserve the balance of my time, Your Honors.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

21 Phillips.

22 Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you.

23 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

24 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

25 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. MINEAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

2 and may it please the Court:

3 The United States submits that the right to a

4 patent is an important matter, but it must be

5 considered in the context of the remedies as well.

6 And the United States further submits the

7 patentee's right to an injunction should be covered by

8 the familiar four-factor test this Court has applied in

9 cases such as Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo. This

10 Court's express endorsement of the four-factor test

11 would provide disciplined guidance and a framework for

12 the lower courts to evaluate whether or not a patent

13 should issue in any particular case.

14 The court of appeals in this case did not

15 make express reference to the four-factor test.

16 Nevertheless, it did identify the difficulties with the

17 -- the district court's decisions.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't think Mr.

19 -- you don't think Judge Bryson forgot about the four-

20 factor test, do you?

21 MR. MINEAR: Absolutely not.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure. And -- and he

23 was just reflecting the reality that in a typical case,

24 this is what happens. It seems to me all you want us

25 to do is edit his opinion and stick in this formulaic

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 paragraph about there are four factors and here they

2 are.

3 MR. MINEAR: Not exactly, Your Honor. We

4 think that there is some legitimate confusion among the

5 patent bar and in the community about whether or not

6 this test issues nearly automatically or not.

7 Certainly there are many amicus briefs on both sides.

8 And we think it's useful for this Court to make clear

9 that this is an exercise of equitable discretion.

10 Now, Judge Bryson, I think, was aware of the

11 four-factor test. In fact, both parties cited the

12 four-factor test before the district court.

13 He was also aware of the abuse of discretion

14 standard. That's a well-established standard and the

15 parties cited that standard to the Federal Circuit in

16 the course of briefing this case below.

17 But what we think this Court can do is it can

18 provide guidance on how those factors are applied in

19 the patent context in this very important area. We

20 think the court of appeals decision is correct. The

21 judgment is correct. But we think that there's some

22 benefit to this Court explaining why that is so, and

23 I'd like to --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask you about

25 one factor in particular? What if by the time you get

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to the injunction stage, the -- the patent office has,

2 you know, rejected all of the underlying claims in a

3 preliminary way? It's not final. Can the district

4 court take that into account in deciding not to issue

5 an injunction?

6 MR. MINEAR: Well, I think, Your Honor,

7 you're referring to the reexamination process

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

9 MR. MINEAR: -- that, in fact, is ongoing in

10 this case. And we think merely that the Patent and

11 Trademark Office's office action is not sufficient. In

12 this case, if I can speak outside the record, there has

13 been what is called a first office action and a second

14 office action, but no final action by the PTO. But

15 even if there was final action by the PTO, that would

16 still be subject to review by an administrative body,

17 the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, and

18 there would be further judicial review. The PTO would

19 not withdraw the patent, would not certify that it's

20 invalid until the conclusion of the judicial process.

21 So we think for that reason the district

22 court should not act precipitously. It may have -- the

23 district court would have discretion to take that into

24 account, whether it should stay further proceedings

25 pending the --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's what

2 struck me as odd there. Footnote 27 says that's a

3 basis for staying the injunction. It seems to me if

4 it's a basis for staying the injunction, it's a basis

5 not to issue one in the first place.

6 MR. MINEAR: Well, it also might be a -- a

7 basis in terms of how to structure the injunction. We

8 simply meant to indicate in footnote 27 the district

9 court has discretion on remand to take these factors

10 into account based on where the case is at that time.

11 We're not taking a position one way or another what the

12 Court should do in this particular case. That is an

13 exercise of discretion. It's subject to review for

14 abuse of discretion.

15 But I would like to talk about the four

16 individual factors in this case because I think it

17 provides helpful guidance in the resolution of the

18 dispute before the Court.

19 As an initial matter, with regard to

20 irreparable injury, patent infringement normally will

21 result in irreparable injury because it denies the

22 patent holder its statutory right to exclude others

23 from practicing the invention. It's the type of right

24 that is susceptible to irreparable injury because --

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it denies the right

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 subject to being a damage remedy that's available.

2 MR. MINEAR: That's correct, but the

3 difficulty here is the pragmatic question of whether

4 the district court can determine whether damages are

5 appropriate or not in a particular case.

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is it always -- is it

7 always going to be irreparable injury if the patentee

8 always gets fairly compensated?

9 MR. MINEAR: No. There -- we certainly

10 recognize there can be cases where there would not be

11 irreparable --

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: So if there are some cases

13 when he gets fairly compensated and some he does not,

14 why should you say it's always irreparable injury?

15 MR. MINEAR: Well, my -- our position is not

16 that it's always, but that it normally is irreparable

17 injury. It usually will be. And there are certainly

18 circumstances we can envision where it would not be

19 irreparable injury.

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that usually will be

21 because usually damages are not an adequate remedy?

22 MR. MINEAR: Yes, that's correct. And the

23 reason why damages are not an adequate remedy is

24 because, as Judge Easterbrook indicated, it's very

25 difficult for the district court, looking forward, to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 determine what business opportunities are available to

2 the -- to the licensor or the practitioner in the face

3 of the prospect of continuing infringement. And that

4 is why, as Judge Easterbrook noted in the Catheter

5 case, the injunction harnesses the market to determine

6 what the market value of that patent is. It forces

7 negotiation between the parties, as compared to the

8 court acting to try and develop a reasonable royalty

9 based on a battle of experts.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: When you say going forward,

11 I thought we were talking about damages for the past

12 violation, not damages for future violations which will

13 continue. Are we talking about that too?

14 MR. MINEAR: Yes, that's what we're talking

15 about.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: About the court effectively

17 saying, yes, here pay him and -- and go on and skip

18 away and continue violating it.

19 MR. MINEAR: Well, when a district court --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: In this case, they -- they

21 claim not to want to violate it in the future. They're

22 just talking about, you know, the -- the past actions

23 should -- should be compensable by damages and not --

24 they should not be subjected to a very threatening

25 injunction.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. MINEAR: Yes, but in this case the

2 district court has awarded the damages for the past --

3 past actions already, and the question is how will we

4 deal with the threat of continuing infringement. And

5 the difficulty that the district court faces here is it

6 has to, if it takes no action, as it's done now, it

7 will at some later date have to go back and determine

8 what those damages would be.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which -- when they will be

10 calculable. You're saying it's hard to calculate them

11 into the future. You want the district court to

12 calculate what the future damages will be and say, we

13 think the damages will be this. Here, take your money,

14 and you, God bless you, go continue to violate the

15 patent.

16 MR. MINEAR: Absolutely not.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that what --

18 MR. MINEAR: We are suggesting what Justice

19 Kennedy suggested; namely, that the injunction

20 proceedings provide an opportunity to determine whether

21 or not the supposed work-around that eBay has will work

22 or will not, and the injunction will be structured to

23 allow it or not, depending on whether or not it's

24 determined to be infringing. That allows the market to

25 go forward with a determination, a certainty that eBay

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 will have that its work-around is either violative or

2 it is not. But our view is that by issuing the

3 injunction, the district court, in the proceedings

4 leading up to the injunction, can determine whether or

5 not this work-around is valid or not.

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there a classic case

7 where the injunction should not be issued?

8 MR. MINEAR: Yes. There -- I think there --

9 this is a four-factor test, and there are questions of

10 balance of hardship and public interest. And certainly

11 equity should be cautious not to inflict unnecessary

12 hardship on parties. In the case of a nonwillful

13 infringer, for instance, that has made good faith

14 investments that might be set aside by the -- by an

15 injunction, there might be grounds in those

16 circumstances not to issue an injunction. There's also

17 a public interest inquiry as well. If the injunction

18 would threaten national security, public health and

19 safety, undermine core aspects of commerce --

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Business processes?

21 MR. MINEAR: Well, business processes are not

22 -- the district court clearly erred here in saying that

23 the mere debate about business process patents is a

24 reason for withholding injunctions. That simply is not

25 a sufficient view -- reason in our mind for weighing

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 against the general public interest and the

2 enforceability of patents and the use of injunctions to

3 make sure that those property rights are secure.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm curious about

6 your nonwillful infringer. You're devaluing the value

7 of a particular patent by denying the injunction simply

8 because the people who infringed it weren't willful,

9 and I wonder why that makes sense.

10 MR. MINEAR: We're not suggesting that

11 automatically that there is withhold with relief

12 because of a nonwillful infringement. We're simply

13 drawing the -- the distinction between a case, such as

14 this, where there is willful infringement -- and, in

15 fact, the party has been found to have both had notice

16 of the patent and also have known that it did not --

17 did not have a reasonable basis for concluding it was

18 not infringing or the patent was invalid. In those

19 circumstances, the patentee takes on greater risk than

20 the party that simply is not aware of the -- of the

21 patent and in a sense stepped over a property line

22 without realizing that, in fact, it was there.

23 This is, again, a four-factor test, and we

24 believe all factors need to be considered in order to

25 provide the --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it your bottom line

2 then, send it back with your four-factor test, because

3 there seems to be some uncertainty whether that was

4 applied?

5 MR. MINEAR: We don't think that's

6 appropriate because, first of all, the -- the court of

7 appeals did identify the factors the district court

8 relied on that weighed on -- it thought weighed on

9 eBay's side of the balance, and it properly rejected

10 each one of those.

11 But furthermore, we think that this Court's

12 enunciation of the tests and the application of the

13 tests, much as it did in the patent case of Pfaff v.

14 Wells Electronics 3 years ago, could provide very

15 useful guidance in terms of how this test applies in a

16 specific, concrete context.

17 But the factors that the court of appeals

18 relied on here and rejected, found insufficient were

19 really quite right. First of all, there should not be

20 an automatic distinction between a party that practices

21 the patent and one that licenses it. They both have --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: There isn't an automatic

23 distinction, but a person who licenses a patent and who

24 is licensing a patent that probably won't be developed

25 very much beyond what it is -- it's fairly easy to --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 I'll ask Mr. Waxman.

2 MR. MINEAR: Thank you, Your Honor.

3 (Laughter.)

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

5 Minear.

6 Mr. Waxman.

7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

8 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9 MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11 I -- I can anticipate at least one question.

12 Let me just say at the outset --

13 (Laughter.)

14 MR. WAXMAN: -- that long, perhaps centuries,

15 before Justice Story ever wrote his commentaries on

16 equity, it has been firmly, unequivocally established

17 that a final judgment, not -- we're not talking about

18 an interlocutory order, but a final judgment of patent

19 infringement yields an injunction in all but the very

20 rare case. And that settled regime is not an exception

21 to traditional equitable principles. It's an

22 application of those principles.

23 Equity, as this Court has reminded us over

24 and over again, including in the Weinberger and the

25 Amoco cases -- equity first takes account of the nature

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of both the right at stake and the violation. And

2 because the only right that a patent provides under

3 U.S. law is a limited-term right to exclude others from

4 practicing the invention, infringement produces an

5 injury that is both, A, irreparable by its nature and,

6 B, continuing in the nature of a continuing trespass to

7 chattels. And under traditional equity principles, a

8 showing of either of those things, either irreparable

9 injury or a continuing harm, warrants an injunction in

10 the owner's favor unless the offending party can

11 marshal very strong equities otherwise. That is the

12 settled rule.

13 Now, no such showing could be made in this

14 case. The jury found, by clear and convincing

15 evidence, that eBay had willfully infringed the '265

16 patent, that it knew about it, and it had no good faith

17 belief either that the patent was invalid or that it

18 was not infringing. The jury was told that if it found

19 either of those things, it could not find willfulness,

20 and it found willfulness by clear and convincing

21 evidence.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We also know by now

23 that the patent office has rejected all of the claims

24 of the patent. The staff.

25 MR. WAXMAN: The -- what we know is that --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, with the following

2 clarification, that the office action, as Mr. Minear

3 has indicated, represents a -- an initial judgment by a

4 staff member in the office.

5 And what -- what is quite -- and it is --

6 doesn't represent even the PTO's final judgment in the

7 case, but what is really revealing here is that

8 reexamination is a process that was invoked by eBay.

9 And as we point out in our brief, typically if a

10 competitor is concerned or doubts the validity of a

11 patent, it will invoke reexamination, ask the PTO to

12 reexamine it when it first learns about it. eBay not

13 only didn't invoke reexamination, it cited the '265

14 patent at least 24 times years before. It then came to

15 MercExchange and offered to buy it.

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that a factor that

17 a district court could take into account in deciding

18 whether to issue an injunction?

19 MR. WAXMAN: I don't --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Say the injunction

21 question came up right now, today. Could the district

22 court say, well, the patent office staff has rejected

23 every claim of this patent, and I'm going to take that

24 into account in deciding whether to put eBay out of

25 business?

1 MR. WAXMAN: I think that -- the case that

2 the U.S. cites in its footnote is an example where

3 reexamination processes are underway when the case is

4 first filed or when it's pending in the district court,

5 and the district judge certainly has the discretion to

6 say, I don't want to get into a -- a fight here about

7 separation of powers and Hayburns case. Let's let the

8 reexam proceed, and then we'll have a trial.

9 In this case, eBay waited not only until it

10 was sued and not only until it was found to have

11 willfully infringed this patent, but in the middle of

12 the appeals process. It then comes running in and a

13 rule that would allow a district judge now to give

14 notice of that in denying an injunction would basically

15 be a -- an open invitation for everybody to go ahead

16 and try and win at trial, go through the whole multi-

17 year process, and if you don't, just put it into

18 reexam. This -- although the reexamination is required

19 to be -- is required to proceed with, quote, special

20 dispatch under the statute, this reexamination of the

21 '265 patent has been almost 3 years in the patent

22 office and we still don't have a final action.

23 So we think, in the circumstances of this

24 case, where the district judge had no reason to

25 consider reexam because eBay hadn't invoked reexam at

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the time, it would be an abuse of discretion for the

2 court to either refuse an injunction or stay it in

3 light of the fact that it's now proceeding.

4 But that's not an issue for this Court. It

5 wasn't an issue for the court of appeals because it

6 wasn't part of the district judge's analysis of the

7 requisite equitable factors.

8 And what -- if I can just get back to the

9 facts of this particular case and then talk about the

10 law. The finding of eBay's willfulness in this case

11 disables eBay from invoking the relative balance of

12 harms. We certainly agree --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? I mean, I think there

14 are so many factors that could enter into it.

15 MR. WAXMAN: Well --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: What I was going to ask was

17 if you have a -- a patentee that does only license and,

18 moreover, licenses only to people who, by and large,

19 will not take that product and develop it further, then

20 it's fairly easy to calculate damages.

21 Now, couple that with a client or a patentee

22 who also waits for a long time, waits till the

23 invention is embedded in a series of other inventions

24 so that if, in fact, there's an injunction, what will

25 happen is that the patentee will be able to extract far

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 more than this particular invention is worth because

2 the infringer would have to give up the entire

3 invention.

4 MR. WAXMAN: Justice --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: Couple that with a patent

6 that, if you read it on page 2 of the red brief,

7 reminds, at least one person who read it, namely me,

8 that if this could be patented, maybe A&P could patent

9 their process for a supermarket. I -- I mean, you'd

10 worry about that as a judge. And couple that with all

11 the other things that are here.

12 Now, special case? Why not?

13 MR. WAXMAN: I've been asked to couple so

14 many things together, I may forget some of the

15 coupling. Please -- I mean this in seriousness.

16 Please remind me because there is a very good answer in

17 law and on the record to each of your points.

18 JUSTICE BREYER: The main point -- what I was

19 trying to do is I was trying to take what I'd call the

20 patent troll case.

21 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. First of all, this is no

22 patent troll. The founder of MercExchange really did

23 invent this innovation. He really did, as the record

24 clearly shows, spend years of effort trying to build

25 the system to suit himself, and he is no promiscuous

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 licensor. He has -- it has entered into licenses,

2 which are all in the joint appendix, that are very

3 specialized in terms. He was asked by eBay in 2000 to

4 consider selling them. He offered to license them.

5 The parties couldn't come to terms, and eBay then stole

6 the technology. It willfully infringed it, knowing

7 about it, having cited this as prior art, having had

8 one patent rejected as fully anticipated by the '265.

9 And the common law and equitable principles

10 have -- are quite clear from Story, Pomeroy, all the

11 way back, that when you -- when you're talking about

12 balancing private harms, which is what equity courts do

13 -- I'm not talking about the public interest, but I

14 mean private harms, when you have an adjudicated,

15 willful infringer -- I mean, the jury found that it had

16 no good faith belief either that it wasn't infringing

17 or that the patent was invalid -- you don't balance

18 private harms.

19 But let's take the case in which you don't

20 have willfulness. It's not this case. Let's take the

21 case of somebody who doesn't try and, quote, practice

22 the patent. That's not this case. Let's take the case

23 of somebody who's a garage inventor who decides the way

24 to exploit the patent is to license it. License --

25 this -- so far as I'm aware, this is the first case.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 The district court decision in this case is the first

2 case in the context of a permanent injunction. And

3 I'll explain why preliminary injunctions that seek to

4 preserve the status quo are different. This is the

5 first permanent injunction case I'm aware of that has

6 ever thought that exploiting the patent by licensing it

7 to others to make use of would in -- somehow be costly

8 or disable you from obtaining the relief that section

9 283 and the -- and tradition provided.

10 Section -- section 284, which is the damages

11 provision, talks about remedies, remedies for

12 infringement that has already occurred.

13 The text of section 283 says -- the other

14 side keeps referring to may, may, may not, shall.

15 That's fine. But the purpose of it is to prevent. The

16 operative word in 283 is to prevent. And unless there

17 is an instance in which the patent has expired, the --

18 the infringer is out of business and can show that it

19 couldn't possibly infringe anymore, an injunction

20 issues to prevent further violation.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: On that very point, my

22 question there really was -- that was the heart of it

23 -- that I don't think there's a moral or even patent-

24 related value attached to whether you practice it

25 yourself or not. It's just that when you license it,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it's easier -- and a lot of other things matter too.

2 MR. WAXMAN: Well --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: But it's easier to calculate

4 the damage. Now, at least in some subset of cases.

5 So if you have a case where, on the one hand,

6 it's easier to calculate the damage remedy, and at the

7 same time you fear that to issue an injunction will

8 produce a harm to the other side way out of proportion

9 to, in fact, the value that's being lost by infringing

10 on the patent, then those are two things you'd put in

11 the balance.

12 MR. WAXMAN: That's --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: So the -- other things being

14 equal --

15 MR. WAXMAN: In the case of a nonwillful

16 infringer, a court in --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: No. Willful, willful. It

18 wouldn't matter willful or nonwillful, because if he's

19 willful, the reason that he might be willful is he

20 thinks that the patentee is holding him up.

21 MR. WAXMAN: You know, the -- the -- there

22 are 52 self-proclaimed intellectual property professors

23 that filed a brief written by Professor Lemley in

24 support of eBay in this case. Professor Lemley

25 testified under oath to Congress that, even though

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there are problems with patent trolls, in the case of a

2 willful infringer, the law -- equity doesn't balance

3 private harms.

4 But even if that were wrong, I acknowledge

5 that in balancing, there may be cases in which you can

6 show a vastly disproportionate harm. Okay? I mean,

7 the other side has amicus briefs that come up with

8 these hypothetical scenarios about, you know, one

9 little aspect of a computer chip that has 30,000

10 components to it. Note, A, that all of those are

11 hypothetical, and B, I'll explain why it's a problem of

12 extremely limited circumstances.

13 But, of course, equity courts can decide

14 that, just as they can decide whether the -- the,

15 quote, innocent patent holder is guilty of laches,

16 unclean hands, estoppel, all of these other equitable

17 considerations that aren't captured by this formulaic

18 four-factor test but that equity courts, including

19 district courts sitting under -- under 283, consider.

20 But this is not the case of some profligate

21 licensor. This is somebody who has licensed with

22 specific provisions. The other side says, well, there

23 are no operative licenses, suggesting somehow that the

24 AutoTrader license, which is one of our examples, is in

25 fact invalid. That came up in their reply brief. It

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 is not correct. It is absolutely true that eBay will

2 not -- the '265 patent is included by that license. It

3 relates to the field of use of auto sales. It provides

4 specifically that eBay -- that MercExchange cannot

5 receive royalties unless it enforces this patent within

6 the field of use. There is no doubt that -- that

7 MercExchange will not be able to start getting patent

8 royalties from AutoTrader unless and until it obtains

9 this injunction. And for example --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman, you

11 mentioned, in -- in responding to the suggestion that

12 we're dealing with a troll, you described -- what

13 exactly is the invention here?

14 MR. WAXMAN: The -- the invention is a --

15 it's -- it's not a business method. It doesn't claim

16 methods. It claims a system, an apparatus for an

17 electric market for the sale of goods via a network.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Electric. I mean,

19 it's not like --

20 MR. WAXMAN: Electronic market.

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- he invented the,

22 you know, internal combustion engine or anything. It's

23 very vague I think, and this is one of the

24 considerations --

25 MR. WAXMAN: Well --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the district court

2 mentioned. The exact parameters of when it was going

3 to be infringed and when it wasn't were amorphous. And

4 so isn't that a factor the district court can take into

5 account in deciding whether to issue an injunction

6 because it's going to be hard to issue an injunction to

7 define exactly when it's going to be violated and when

8 it's not?

9 MR. WAXMAN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, if it

10 turns out that it's too hard and -- and the -- and a

11 specific injunction can't be written, rule 65(d)

12 requires that an injunction not issue. And in fact, as

13 we've cited in pages 17 and 18 and, I think, 19 of our

14 brief, the Federal Circuit has, in fact, overruled

15 injunctions that were insufficiently precise to satisfy

16 rule 65.

17 But the claim of imprecision here is -- look,

18 I'm not a software developer and I have reason to

19 believe that neither is Your Honor, and I -- I can't --

20 (Laughter.)

21 MR. WAXMAN: -- explain specifically what

22 this claims. It's laid out very carefully in --

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I may not be a

24 software developer, but as I read the invention, it's

25 displaying pictures of your wares on a computer network

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and, you know, picking which ones you want and buying

2 them. I -- I might have been able to do that.

3 MR. WAXMAN: Well --

4 (Laughter.)

5 MR. WAXMAN: I'll say respectfully that that

6 is not a fair characterization of the innovation here,

7 the actual innovation.

8 But let me just say, for purposes of this

9 case, there is no challenge continuing to the validity

10 of this patent. It was challenged before the district

11 court and on appeal on grounds of an inadequate written

12 description, et cetera, et cetera, and upheld. There

13 was a Markman hearing in which the district court

14 construed the patent, added certain claim limitation

15 terms that eBay wanted and we thought were not fairly

16 in it. But significantly, there was never -- never --

17 a claim to the judge -- and this is an issue for the

18 judge under section 112, paragraph 2 -- of -- of

19 invalidity for indefiniteness.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the patent

21 office staff has rejected all the claims. I don't know

22 on what grounds.

23 MR. WAXMAN: The patent office -- none of the

24 claims have been rejected on indefinite grounds. They

25 have been rejected, as I understand it, certainly in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 this patent, for obviousness under prior art, which is

2 all the same prior art that was presented to an Article

3 III court here and that a jury entered a finding on.

4 There are a host of questions that undoubtedly will be

5 presented in the case, if it ever happens, in which a

6 final -- Patent and Trademark Office, on the validity

7 of a patent, contravenes something that a -- a final

8 judgment of an Article III court. But that's not this

9 case.

10 And we certainly agree with the United States

11 that when -- if the judgment is affirmed, the case will

12 go back and the district court will then have to

13 address a point it hasn't addressed yet, which is is

14 the -- is the -- the permanent injunction proposed by

15 MercExchange adequate or inadequate and how can it be

16 made specific, and this supposed work-around -- does it

17 or doesn't it violate the terms of the injunction. I

18 mean, the district judge actually found bad faith --

19 this is page, I think, 71 of the petition appendix --

20 of eBay in its conduct in the district court of

21 proclaiming that for $8,000 -- its experts testified

22 that for $8,000, they could work around or design

23 around this problem and there wouldn't be an

24 infringement. But they didn't do it. And they didn't

25 -- they certainly didn't appear to have done it in the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Federal Circuit because their brief in the Federal

2 Circuit never mentions it, and the Federal Circuit

3 opinion surely would have said, they've designed around

4 this problem and, you know, therefore this, that, or

5 the other. Even in this Court, eBay has said in its --

6 in its opening brief at page 43, here there is a

7 possibility that the infringer can develop a work-

8 around. Well --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Waxman, could you help

10 me with something I just realized I have no conception

11 of here? What kind of -- what do these injunctions

12 say? Do they just say don't infringe patent '265

13 anymore, or do they give a list of things you cannot do

14 and a list of articles you cannot make and so forth?

15 MR. WAXMAN: You couldn't just say don't

16 infringe anymore because rule 65(d) requires

17 specificity and precision. Ordinarily what happens in

18 these cases is there's -- you know, there's usually

19 been a claimed -- a detailed, claimed construction

20 following a Markman hearing. There have been jury

21 instructions. The jury instructions have to

22 specifically describe to the jury on what basis it's to

23 conclude who is right --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: The thought just occurs to

25 me and I -- frankly, with all the briefs we've had, I

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 feel kind of stupid not to have thought it before. But

2 it seems to me a great difference might turn on what

3 exactly the injunction provided. Some injunctions must

4 be -- might be much more burdensome than some others.

5 If they're not all fungible, that's certainly true.

6 MR. WAXMAN: Certainly not. And the terms of

7 an injunction are appealable, and the Federal Circuit

8 has reviewed actual terms of permanent injunctions and

9 reversed a number of them and said this is -- this

10 doesn't satisfy rule 65 or it doesn't meet other

11 requirements.

12 But in the -- in the context of this case, it

13 is so critical that the judgment be affirmed, not

14 vacated, because this is a real inventor. This is

15 somebody who really did try to put it in place. This

16 is somebody who eBay approached and then, when they

17 didn't buy it, appropriated the technology, and the

18 validity and infringement are final. They aren't even

19 challenged in this Court.

20 And any suggestion that uncertainty exists on

21 the facts of this case would dramatically destabilize

22 settled law, licensing practices, and the investment-

23 backed expectations of patent holders, large and small,

24 the sole -- you know, hall of fame inventors that are

25 in the Cooper brief filed in support of us and big,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 integrated companies like GE and Johnson & Johnson that

2 have also filed on our side.

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this?

4 MR. WAXMAN: These are patent portfolios --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: One -- one short question.

6 Is the draft of the injunction that you want in the

7 record?

8 MR. WAXMAN: It is in the court of appeals

9 record, but not the joint appendix. But it certainly

10 will have to be changed because the court of appeals

11 invalidated the '176 patent, which the jury found had

12 been infringed, and therefore, it's -- it will need to

13 be revisited when the case goes back for the entry of

14 an injunction.

15 Thank you, Your Honor.

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

17 Waxman.

18 Mr. Phillips, you have 6 minutes remaining.

19 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

20 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

21 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

22 I realize I'm the only thing standing between you and

23 lunch, so I'll try to be brief at this point.

24 Justice Stevens, with respect to the place in

25 the record, this is in the joint appendix and the court

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of appeals at A6523 -- 62523. That's the proposed

2 permanent injunction, and I won't purport to read the

3 whole thing, but it starts off with anything directly

4 or indirectly, and it goes on for three pages. It is,

5 I think, fairly characterized as a very broad

6 injunction.

7 The -- I think it's important, after Mr.

8 Waxman's challenge to the conduct of eBay in this case,

9 to -- to recognize that willfulness in the patent

10 context has a meaning different from willfulness in any

11 other context. And it is recognized that we're talking

12 about simply a failure to satisfy a duty to check out

13 and find a lawyer's opinion that a particular

14 infringement has not taken place or that the patent is

15 not valid. And when you do that, you of course incur

16 the risk that you will also waive your attorney-client

17 privilege. So there's a risk to it. And that's the

18 willfulness that we're talking about here.

19 With respect to the notion of stealing this

20 patent, let's go back to what the district court

21 specifically held on page 68 of the appendix. Where

22 the defendants maintain that their success did not

23 arise from the use of anything contained in the

24 plaintiff's patents and the defendants argued that the

25 patents offered no business or engineering guidance

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 which the defendants could copy, and this court agrees

2 with that. That's not the kind of bad faith or

3 willfulness -- it's the reason why the court didn't

4 grant enhanced damages. It's the reason why the court

5 didn't grant attorney's fees in this particular case,

6 and it doesn't provide a reason for simply jettisoning

7 three out of the four factors that ought to be applied

8 in the traditional -- in the traditional test.

9 And, Justice Breyer, you asked the question,

10 what are you going to do with a situation where you

11 have the embedded patent and you have the case like

12 this one where we're going along with our process and

13 we've got our source code and we've done all of the

14 hard work, and they go along and come up with some sort

15 of more vague idea and show up at our doorstep and,

16 one, claim that we've got to stop doing what we're

17 doing, or, worse in other cases, we're going to find

18 situations where it's embedded in a manufacturing

19 process. Mr. Waxman says, well, in that situation

20 equity will step in. Not so under the Federal

21 Circuit's approach because that's a balance of the

22 equities kind of a consideration, and that's

23 irrebuttably presumed to favor the plaintiff under the

24 Federal Circuit's approach.

25 Mr. Chief Justice, I know, as well as you

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 know, that Judge Bryson understands the four-factor

2 test and the abuse of discretion standard. And what he

3 did in this case was to go through each of the findings

4 of the district court with respect to the use of the --

5 of the licensing arrangements, the failure to

6 commercialize this, not being in the business, and

7 said, does any of these rise to the level of the kind

8 of public interest concern that is the only legitimate

9 consideration this court will use in deciding whether

10 or not the district court can justify not granting an

11 injunction in a particular case, instead of what is

12 clearly the traditional approach of equity, which is to

13 say, look at the -- the primary two issues, you know,

14 the flip side of the same thing, so I'll just treat it

15 the one way. Are money damages adequate in the

16 specific case? That's the fundamental question that

17 equity asks. That's the fundamental question that the

18 district court found to be satisfied in this case.

19 Money damages will get the job done. The right to

20 exclude will be adequately protected by enhanced

21 damages and even potentially injunctive relief in the

22 future. Beyond that, nothing more is required.

23 That's the kind of decision that a district

24 court who has sat in a 5-week trial and has overseen

25 this entire litigation is uniquely suited to make a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

56

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 judgment. That judgment is entitled to respect on a

2 classic abuse of discretion standard. The court of

3 appeals long ago jettisoned that approach, and the time

4 has come for this Court to say no, that's not what this

5 Patent Act requires. The Patent Act says the right to

6 exclude is important, but it's only protected by the

7 principles of equity under section 283. That wasn't

8 given here. We urge you to reverse the court of

9 appeals.

10 If there are no further questions, thank you,

11 Your Honor.

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

13 The case is submitted.
