1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:06 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Garre, welcome 4 back. 5 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE 6 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 7 MR. GARRE: Thank you, Your Honor, and may 8 it please the Court: 9 The question in this case is when does a 10 trained drug detection dog's alert to a vehicle 11 establish probable cause to search the vehicle? 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you for or against the 13 dog this time? 14 MR. GARRE: For it again, Your Honor. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: For it. 16 MR. GARRE: The Florida Supreme Court 17 answered that question by erecting what we think is an 18 extraordinary set of evidentiary requirements, in 19 effect, puts the dog on trial in any suppression hearing 20 in which defendant chooses to challenge the reliability 21 of the dog. 22 I think, most fundamentally, the problem 23 with the court of appeals' -- the Supreme Court's 24 decision -- is that it misconceives what this Court's 25 cases conceive of the probable cause requirement,
3

1 converting probable cause, which this Court has referred 2 to as a substantial chance, or fair probability, of the 3 detection of contraband or evidence of a crime, into 4 what amounts to a continuously updated batting average 5 and a requirement that dogs be virtually infallible. 6 That -- that -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Garre -8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- that goes to the 9 field performance; but, the other requirements, that 10 the -- some showing that the test -- that the training 11 program is reputable, some showing that the handler, not 12 only the dog, has -- has had training, it seems to me 13 those two -- not -- there's nothing improper about that. 14 MR. GARRE: Well, and I think, Your Honor, 15 under our view of it, it's okay to inquire into whether 16 or not the dog has successfully completed a bona fide 17 training program, which -- which we think is a training 18 program in which the dog is going to be tested for 19 proficiency, including in a setting where some vehicles 20 have drugs and some vehicles don't. 21 And Aldo, the dog in this case, clearly was. 22 He'd received a 120-hour training program with the 23 police department in Apopka, Florida. He received a 24 40-hour refresher seminar by another police department 25 in Dothan, Alabama. And he was subjected to continuous
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 weekly training, in which part of that training 2 consisted of taking him out, walking him by some 3 vehicles that contained cars, some vehicles that didn't. 4 And the testimony of Officer Wheetley was 5 that Aldo's performance was really good. And what he 6 meant by that was that if there were eight cars with 7 drugs. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't -- then why 9 didn't they get the dog recertified? By the time of the 10 search, the certification had expired 16 months. 11 MR. GARRE: It was a lapse, Your Honor. The 12 dog subsequently was recertified. 13 Our position is that the Fourth Amendment 14 doesn't impose an annual certification requirement. 15 Some states have it, some states don't. 16 I think, more important in this case was the 17 fact that the dog was continuously trained, continuously 18 evaluated in training. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what do you -- what 20 do you have to show to establish that the dog was well 21 trained. 22 MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, I think the 23 most important thing is successful completion of 24 proficiency testing. 25 I mean, what -- what our friends would like,
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 and what the Florida Supreme Court would like, would 2 really for the courts to delve into all aspects of the 3 training, what types of distracters were used, what type 4 of smell and printing was used and the like. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if it were just 6 that -- you have the show that the program was 7 reputable. 8 MR. GARRE: Well, certainly that it was 9 authentic, Your Honor. And here, the programs were -10 were conducted by actual police departments in -- in 11 Alabama and Florida. And this Court ordinarily would 12 presume regularity in those sorts of training settings. 13 And there's no reason to approach the 14 training of a dog any differently, but -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought all of these 16 training facilities were private entities that 17 contracted with police departments. 18 MR. GARRE: No, Your Honor. The 19 certification. Certification usually is done by private 20 entities which are operated by former law enforcement 21 officers. But the training itself, it usually and here 22 was done by police departments themselves. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I go back to 24 Justice Ginsburg's question? There's no -- what I 25 hear -- read the Florida court saying is there's no
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 national standard for certification. That's correct? 2 MR. GARRE: Yes. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's no national 4 standard that defines what's adequate training, correct. 5 MR. GARRE: That's right. There -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So -- let me just finish 7 my question. So assuming there's no national standards, 8 then how do you expect a judge, without asking questions 9 about the content of the certification process, the 10 content of the training process, and what the results 11 were and how they were measured, how do you expect a 12 judge to decide whether the certification and the 13 training are sufficiently adequate. 14 MR. GARRE: And I think that the central 15 inquiry that we would think the judge would undertake is 16 to determine whether or not the dog was performing 17 successfully in proficiency testing. 18 I mean -- after all, that's why we train the 19 dogs. And if -20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you still have to 21 ask what that training was, and the judge still has to 22 determine whether the judge believes it was adequate, 23 correct? That's what the totality of circumstances 24 requires. 25 MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, in our view,
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 we don't think it's -- it's an appropriate role for the 2 Court to delve into the contours of the training, what 3 specific methods were used to train or distract or -4 you know, all the contours that they bring up in their 5 brief. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what does a judge do, 7 just say, the police department says this is adequate, 8 so I have to accept it's adequate? 9 MR. GARRE: Not -- you would have to accept 10 it, Your Honor, on its face. I think you -- in a record 11 like this -- and I think this record is clearly 12 sufficient -- and, ultimately, that's what we're asking 13 this Court to hold -- what you have in the record 14 is evidence -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Garre, I -- I have 16 no problem that this record -- with this record. My 17 problem is how do we rule. 18 Because it seems the me that I'm not quite 19 understanding what -- how -- the legal rule you're 20 asking us to announce. I think the legal rule, you're 21 saying, if the dog has been tested for proficiency by a 22 police department's determination of what's adequate for 23 proficiency, that establishes probable cause. That's 24 what I think the rule you want us to -- to do. 25 I don't know what the role of the judge is
8

1 in that -2 MR. GARRE: I think it would be close -3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- with that rule. 4 MR. GARRE: -- close to that. We would ask 5 whether or not the dog successfully treated -- completed 6 training by a bona fide organization. And here -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No certification, no 8 questioning of the handler and the handler's training? 9 The judge can't do any of that and shouldn't do any of 10 that. 11 MR. GARRE: Certification is not required. 12 It may be one way that the police department could 13 establish reliability a different way, but certification 14 itself is not required when you have a record of the 15 type of training that you have here. 16 We do think that you could put the handler 17 on the stand and ask about the reliability, certain 18 questions about reliability. 19 We don't think, in a record like this, the 20 judge would say, well, it says that he completed 120 21 hours in narcotics detection at the Apopka, Florida 22 police department, and 40 hours at the Dothan police 23 department, so -24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's not enough for 25 you to win by us saying that a court can't insist on
9

1 performance in the field records, that it has to look at 2 the totality of the circumstances. 3 What other case have -- have we announced, 4 under a totality of the circumstance test, an absolute 5 flat rule like the one you're proposing? Where else 6 have we said that one thing alone establishes probable 7 cause -8 MR. GARRE: Your Honor -9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that one factor 10 alone. 11 MR. GARRE: -- I think one area where the 12 Court mentioned that was in the Lago Vista case, where 13 it talked about the importance of clear rules for police 14 officers and -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose that if the 16 reasonableness of a search depended upon some evidence 17 given by a medical doctor, the Court would not go back 18 and examine how well that doctor was trained at Harvard 19 Medical School and, you know, what classes he took and 20 so forth, right. 21 MR. GARRE: Absolutely. And the same way 22 that when an officer provides evidence for a search 23 warrant, we don't demand the training of the officer, 24 what schools he went to or what specific courses he had 25 in probable cause.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, you said there 2 was the certification, training program, but you gave a 3 third. You said, or otherwise show proficiency in 4 locating narcotics. 5 So if there is no certification, no 6 training, how would the state establish that the dog was 7 reliable in detecting drugs? 8 MR. GARRE: Your Honor, I think that that 9 would be the unusual case, and it probably would be 10 captured by the other factors; but, what we meant by 11 including that is that there's no limit on the types of 12 evidence that the police could submit to show 13 reliability. 14 If you didn't have certification or a formal 15 training program, the fact that there was evidence that 16 a dog like Aldo successfully performed in weekly 17 training over the course of the year, and the police 18 submitted the records, like the records in the Joint 19 Appendix in this case at pages 106 and 116, that might 20 be another way of establishing reliability. 21 But the -- the central way would be showing 22 that the dog successfully completed training or that the 23 dog was certified. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I think you'll agree 25 that the handler, too, the handler would have to --
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, we don't think 2 there is a Fourth Amendment requirement of certification 3 for handlers. Again, this is something that varies 4 among states. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not -- not certification, 6 but that the handler has been -- has been trained -7 MR. GARRE: Yes. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to work with drug 9 detection dogs. 10 MR. GARRE: That's correct. And Officer 11 Wheetley here, of course, had been trained. He had 12 gotten a 160-hour course in narcotics detection, and had 13 done training with Aldo in the Dothan, Alabama police 14 department, 40 hours there. 15 And these dog -- the dog, Aldo, and Officer 16 Wheetley had worked together for about a year before the 17 time of the search. 18 The handlers themselves are going to be in 19 the best position to know the dogs and evaluate their 20 reliability. And they have a strong incentive to ensure 21 the dogs are reliable. That's both because they don't 22 want to miss contraband when it's available -- when it 23 exists in the field; and, also, they don't want to be 24 put into harm's way. 25 The traffic stop, in particular, is one of
12

Alderson Reporting Company

1 the most dangerous encounters police officers face. 2 They're not going to want to be working with a dog that 3 is consistently putting the officer in a position of 4 searching cars based on an alert when that dog is not 5 reliable in predicting the presence -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm somewhat 7 troubled by all of the studies that have been presented 8 to the Court, particularly the Australian one where, 9 under a controlled setting, one dog alerted correctly 10 only 12 percent of the time. 11 How and when and who determines when a dog's 12 reliability in alerting has reached a critical failure 13 number? And what is -- what do you suggest that number 14 is, and how does a judge determine that that's being 15 monitored? 16 MR. GARRE: We don't think the 17 Fourth Amendment puts a number on it. This Court has 18 rejected a numerical conception of probable cause. 19 But with respect -20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I'm deeply 21 troubled by a dog that alerts only 12 percent of the 22 time. Whatever -- whether we have a fixed number or an 23 unfixed number, that seems like less than probability 24 for me. 25 MR. GARRE: But, but let me -- let me
13

Alderson Reporting Company

1 address the, the South Wales study, Your Honor, which I 2 think is the one that you were referring to and that's 3 the primary one relied on by the other side. In that 4 case they reported that over the course of several years 5 the dogs' alerts resulted in discovery of drugs only 26 6 percent of the time. 7 But there is another part of that study 8 which doesn't come up in the amicus briefs, and that's 9 that in 60 percent of the other cases the individuals 10 admitted to using drugs or being in the proximity of 11 drugs. And if you include that in the universe of 12 accurate alerts, as you should, then the number becomes 13 70 percent of dogs accurately alerting. That 70 percent 14 based on the primary study that they rely upon -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That doesn't answer what 16 happens to the dogs who have -- dogs grow old. They are 17 taken out of service for a reason. So how -- how is a 18 court supposed to monitor whether or not a dog has 19 fallen out of -20 MR. GARRE: Well, primarily by looking at 21 whether the dog has successfully completed training. 22 And you're right, dogs do go out of service when they 23 reach a certain age. Dogs, like humans, become old and 24 impaired over time. But -- but looking at weekly 25 training records, like are available in this case, dogs
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that successfully perform week in and week out in 2 training are going to successfully perform in the -- in 3 the real world. 4 And, after all, I think the most problematic 5 aspect of the challenges to the reliability of these 6 dogs is that law enforcement agencies across the country 7 at the state and Federal level, law enforcement agencies 8 around the world, and law enforcement agencies that 9 protect this Court rely on detection dogs as reliable 10 predictors of the evidence of contraband, evidence 11 of the presence of explosives or likewise. 12 And this is an area where we think that a 13 page of logic and experience is worth a volume -- a page 14 of experience and history is worth a volume of logic. 15 These dogs have been used and are being used in many 16 settings across the country and across the world today. 17 And the reason they are being used is because the people 18 who work with them know that they are reliable and -19 and know by experience that they are reliable. 20 And that's one of the central problems we 21 have with the argument on the other side, is that 22 ultimately this Court should distrust the reliability of 23 the dogs. And again -24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Garre, could I 25 understand your argument? Because -- suppose in a case
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the government comes in, says this dog has been through 2 training and the handler has been through training. And 3 this is a case in which -- this is never going to come 4 up when the dog actually alerts to narcotics; it's not 5 worth anybody's time at that point. 6 It's only going to come up in a case like 7 this, where a dog alerts to narcotics, there is no -8 there are no narcotics, but something else is found, and 9 so the person ends up being criminally prosecuted. So 10 it's, you know, a small universe of cases. 11 So the government comes in and says that the 12 dog has been trained. Can -- can the criminal defendant 13 at that point call the handler, say, how has the dog 14 been trained, what are the methods that -- that the dog 15 has -- was used, and how did the dog do in training? 16 Can the -- can the defendant do that. 17 MR. GARRE: Your Honor, I think that the 18 defendant can call the handler and can ask those sorts 19 of questions. I think the court would cut it off if you 20 got into questions like, well, did they use the 21 play-reward or the scent-imprinting method in training. 22 Well, what specifics -- because I think that delves too 23 far into the details. 24 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you can ask questions 25 like how did the dog do in training.
16

Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. GARRE: Yes, and that was done here. 2 JUSTICE KAGAN: And how about if you really, 3 if there were some articles that said, you know, that 4 there was a certain kind of method that, for example, 5 led to a lot of subconscious cueing by the handler. 6 Could the -- could the criminal defendant say, did you 7 use that method that leads to these problematic results? 8 MR. GARRE: I -- I don't think so, Your 9 Honor. First of all, cueing is not part of this case 10 because they haven't argued that the dog was cued. The 11 argument is the dog was just sort of inherently 12 reliable. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm using "cueing" not in 14 terms of any intentionality, but one thing that I 15 learned in reading all of this was that one difficulty 16 here is that dogs respond to subconscious cues and that 17 there are different ways of training that make that less 18 or more of a problem. 19 MR. GARRE: And our position is, is that you 20 can inquire into cueing during this hearing, that the 21 defendants can -- can argue that the dog was cued, and 22 in -- in the course of that argument you might be able 23 to get into those sorts of things. That's different 24 than the challenge that was made here. There wasn't a 25 cueing challenge made in this case.

1 I would like to just go back to one of the 2 premises of your question, which is that the dog in this 3 case didn't accurately alert. The dog in this case 4 accurately alerted to the odor of illegal narcotics. 5 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, I didn't mean to say 6 that. I just meant to say that there were -- there were 7 no drugs found. 8 MR. GARRE: Right. And, and I think that's 9 another central problem with the Florida supreme court's 10 decision, is this notion that alerts to so-called 11 residual odors aren't indicative of the dog's 12 reliability. A dog's alert to the lingering odor of 13 methamphetamine which was in the car, must have been in 14 the car in this case, is just as accurate as a dog's 15 alert to the presence of methamphetamine itself in the 16 car. 17 If I could reserve the remainder of my time 18 for rebuttal? 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 20 MR. GARRE: Thank you. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Palmore. 22 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. PALMORE, 23 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 24 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 25 MR.

1 please the Court: 2 This Court has long recognized the ability 3 of trained dogs to reliably detect target odors and such 4 dogs every day perform critical life and death homeland 5 security and law -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I have two 7 separate questions for you. Tying the earlier case a 8 little bit to this one, I am assuming that your position 9 is -- and you'll tell me what the legal standard is -10 that a well-trained dog, if he alerts, or walks by a row 11 of apartments, a row of houses, and alerts to drugs, 12 that that simple alert is probable cause for the police 13 to get a search warrant. 14 MR. PALMORE: Yes, we believe that an alert 15 by a trained dog is sufficient to establish probable 16 cause. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that, without any 18 other information about -- unlike the earlier case or 19 this one, where the police officer saw the individual 20 being nervous, et cetera, et cetera -- that all -- all 21 it takes is a dog alert, despite the fact that there is 22 no study that says the dogs reliably alert 100 percent 23 of the time? 24 MR. PALMORE: 100 percent of the time is of 25 course not required for probable cause.
19

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I -- I understand. 2 MR. PALMORE: It's a fair probability 3 standard and certainty is not required, and I think that 4 was the principal and fundamental flaw of the Florida 5 Supreme Court. It demanded infallibility where 6 infallibility is not required. 7 In terms of studies, it is actually well 8 studied -9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So -- so shouldn't we be 10 addressing the question whether a -- an alert, 11 especially outside a home in particular, should be, 12 standing by itself, enough? 13 MR. PALMORE: I think what the Court -- of 14 course reliability is important. The question is how 15 you determine reliability. This is a somewhat unique 16 setting where the law enforcement tool is actually 17 tested initially and on an ongoing basis in a controlled 18 setting to establish its reliability. Your Honor asked 19 what the standard for bona fide training is. 20 We think the -- the important point is the 21 outcome of the training: Is the dog proficient? Can 22 the dog reliably detect narcotics odor and only 23 narcotics odor in a controlled setting where false 24 positives and false negatives can accurately be 25 measured? That record is established here.

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, only because the 2 officer said that he satisfactorily performed -3 MR. PALMORE: Well -4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and what the Florida 5 court said: But we don't know what that means. 6 MR. PALMORE: Well, we -- I think we do know 7 what it means, Your Honor. There are two different 8 showings that are made here. There is a formal training 9 and formal certification, both for the dog and the 10 handler separately, and then a separate training, formal 11 training together. 12 But then, just as important, you have 13 ongoing, but less formal, proficiency exercises 14 conducted by the handler in which the dog, in a 15 controlled setting where errors could reliably be 16 identified, performed quite strongly, including 2 days 17 before the arrest here. So that's JA 113 on June 22nd, 18 the dog performed perfectly in a controlled setting. 19 And we have -- there are records in this 20 case going back several months before the arrest and 21 several months after the arrest showing that -- that 22 this dog passed the test, this dog was reliable. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you agree that 24 that's an appropriate area of inquiry? 25 MR. PALMORE: We think it is.

When did he last go through some -5 MR. PALMORE: Yes, I think the judge can ask 6 those kinds of questions. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the only 8 thing really you say they can't ask about is what's -9 what's his record. 10 MR. PALMORE: Well, there is a question -11 there are a couple sub-issues here. The principal vice 12 of the Florida Supreme Court was in imposing an 13 unprecedented and inflexible set of evidentiary 14 obligations that are part of the government's 15 affirmative case that the government has to always 16 introduce any time it seeks to establish probable cause 17 based on a dog alert. We think that's fundamentally 18 misplaced for a -- for a variety of reasons. 19 The question of what the government -- what 20 are fair game questions for a defendant to ask once the 21 handler is on the stand is a -- is a different question. 22 And -23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And judges do this 24 thousands of times in thousands of cases. They ask: 25 Was the tip reliable? There are any number of
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 permutations. It's a question of whether or not the 2 trial judge was -- made a correct determination in 3 determining that there was or was not sufficient cause 4 for the police to proceed. It just happens every day. 5 MR. PALMORE: I think that's right, Your 6 Honor, but I think the -- the critical aspect of 7 reliability in this context is the dog's performance in 8 a controlled setting. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Palmore, you 10 criticize the Florida Supreme Court for requiring 11 evidence of field performance; and, assuming that that 12 evidence is not required, if the defendant, in preparing 13 for the suppression motion, wants what information there 14 is, would it be proper to seek -- for the defendant -15 would it be permissible for the defendant to speak -- to 16 seek through discovery whatever field performance 17 records there are? 18 MR. PALMORE: We don't think so, certainly 19 not as a routine basis. The kind of burden that that 20 might impose on law enforcement we don't think is 21 justified. 22 That's a separate question from whether the 23 defendant can ask the handler, if the handler is on the 24 stand, about field performance, and then the court can 25 give that answer whatever weight is appropriate.

1 We think, typically, an answer on field 2 performance is not going to be material. It's not going 3 to be helpful. Because the problem is in the field, 4 when a dog alerts, the dog is trained to alert to the 5 odor of drugs. 6 Your -- it's like a -- what the -- Florida 7 Supreme Court wanted a batting average, a batting 8 average that would be calculated when we know the number 9 of at bats, but we don't know in many cases whether 10 there was a hit or an out. So we had a fraction where 11 we know the denominator but not the numerator. 12 The answer to the Florida supreme court's 13 question and concern about reliability, again, is to go 14 back to the controlled setting, where we know what's a 15 hit and what's an out, and we can calculate a reliable 16 batting average. That needs to be where the focus 17 should be in determining the reliability of a dog. 18 And there should -- there's no reason to 19 constitutionalize the process or the training 20 methodologies that get you to that point. What matters 21 is, is this dog successful in a setting in which we can 22 measure success. 23 And I think that it's also important to 24 point out that the Florida court was basically alone in 25 establishing these unprecedented and inflexible sets of
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 evidentiary requirements. 2 There is a large body of case law in the 3 lower courts on the reliability of drug detection dogs 4 going back 30 or 40 years, and there are no other 5 courts, no other appellate courts to be sure, that have 6 imposed these kinds of requirements on law enforcement 7 when it seeks to establish probable cause for a 8 detection -- for after a detection dog alerts. 9 JUSTICE KAGAN: If you take out the Florida 10 Supreme Court and this one trial court in Massachusetts, 11 basically you think what courts have been doing is the 12 right thing? 13 MR. PALMORE: In general. There is some 14 diversity across the courts, but I think that if you 15 look at Judge Gorsuch's opinion in the Ludwig case from 16 the Tenth Circuit, or the Jones case from the Virginia 17 supreme court, you see approaches that are basically 18 sound, where courts have confidence that if law 19 enforcement comes in and says, this dog is trained and 20 has demonstrated proficiency in a training setting, that 21 that dog is generally reliable. 22 And I think, as Mr. Garre -23 JUSTICE KAGAN: But where at the same time 24 they'll allow a defendant to question the handler about 25 that training, about how the dog has performed in that
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 training; is that right? 2 MR. PALMORE: Yes. Those questions can be 3 asked. 4 But I think it's critical, as Mr. Garre 5 pointed out, that the courts not constitutionalize dog 6 training methodologies or hold mini trials with expert 7 witnesses on what makes for a successful dog training 8 program. Because, as Mr. Garre said, the government has 9 critical interests, life and death interests, that it 10 stakes on the reliability of these dogs. 11 So the U.S. Marshals use dogs to protect 12 Federal judges. The Federal Protective Services use 13 dogs to keep bombs out of Federal buildings. The TSA 14 uses dogs to keep bombs off of airplanes. FEMA uses 15 dogs to find survivors after hurricanes. 16 There are 32 K-9 teams in the field right 17 now in New York and New Jersey looking for survivors of 18 Hurricane Sandy. 19 So, in situation after situation, the 20 government has in a sense put its money where its mouth 21 is, and it believes at an institutional level that these 22 dogs are quite reliable. And I think the courts -23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- I'm not 24 sure it's relevant, but do dogs -- are their -- does 25 their ability -- is it even across the board? In other
26

1 words, if you have a dog that's trained and good at 2 sniffing out heroin, the same dog is going to be good at 3 detecting a bomb, or is there some difference? 4 MR. PALMORE: No, there -- well, I think any 5 dog could be trained in either discipline. And if you 6 look at the Scientific Working Group on Detection Dogs 7 report that we cite in our brief, the report explains 8 that the same general methodologies and the same 9 different -- same general approach is used to train each 10 kinds of dogs. But, typically, a drug detection dog 11 will not be cross-trained on explosives. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you don't know 13 whether -- in other words, are dogs good at sniffing 14 things, or are they -- can they be good at bombs, but 15 not good at meth? 16 MR. PALMORE: Well, I don't know the 17 specific answer to that. I think once a dog kind of 18 chooses a major, that's what they stick with. But I 19 think the important point is that -20 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want coon dogs 21 chasing squirrels. 22 MR. PALMORE: Right. But I think the 23 important point is that these dogs have to meet -- have 24 to pass proficiency in an initial training program, and 25 then they, as is shown in the record here in great

GIFFORD 7 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 8 MR. GIFFORD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 9 please the Court: 10 There is no canine exception to the totality 11 of the circumstances test for probable cause to conduct 12 a warrantless search. If that is true, as it must be, 13 any fact that bears on a dog's reliability as a detector 14 of the presence of drugs comes within the purview of the 15 courts. This can encompass evidence of initial 16 training, certification, maintenance training and 17 performance in the field. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you understand the 19 government to disagree with that general position? In 20 other words, the trial court, if you have an attorney 21 that's really concerned about the training of this dog, 22 they can ask about it. 23 MR. GIFFORD: I do understand the government 24 to disagree about the relevance of field performance. 25 And where I specifically think the government disagrees
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 is on the level of detail that can be inquired into by 2 the trial court on any of these elements. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't think they 4 disagreed about what he may do; I thought they disagreed 5 about what he must do. That is, the Florida Supreme 6 Court said you must, da, da, da, da, da, and gave a 7 whole list. I thought that's what the case was about. 8 MR. GIFFORD: Well, the Florida Supreme 9 Court did have several passages in its opinion where it 10 talked about what the state must produce. And at first 11 glance, that looks rather didactic. 12 However, what I think the Florida Supreme 13 Court was saying there was that if this -- these records 14 exist, the state must produce them. And that is 15 consistent with the state's burden of proof to justify a 16 warrantless search. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: That's a totally different 18 matter. Of course, I agree with you that a trial judge 19 has control of the trial. He's likely to know what's 20 relevant. In different circumstances, different matters 21 will be, and he has first say on what you're going to go 22 into. It's the must. 23 And now you're on the point. Why is that 24 the right list? I mean, what in the Constitution 25 requires that list?

 4 believe the Constitution required it?
 5 MR. GIFFORD: No, I don't think so, even 6 though they used the word "must." I think that the 7 "must" concerns performance records and training records 8 that exist. 9 Farther down in the opinion, the court says 10 reasons why the -- why the state should keep and present 11 performance records -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: But what -13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so if the state 14 doesn't keep -- if the state doesn't keep any 15 performance records, then there would be no field 16 performance to show, but that doesn't mean the state 17 loses; is that what you're saying? 18 The state doesn't keep performance records. 19 The Florida Supreme Court seemed to say field 20 performance records are required. 21 MR. GIFFORD: If the state does not keep 22 field performance records, that is a fact, that is a 23 lack of evidence that could be held against the state in 24 the suppression hearing. And it shifts the focus onto 25 providing evidence of the initial training, the

 2 show to the trial court that this is a reliable dog.

 5 the Florida court was saying is that if you didn't 6 produce it, the dog's evidence would -- would not be 7 allowed -- it's -8 MR.

GIFFORD: -- but it's not -- it's not a 14 specific recipe that can't be deviated from. Because, 15 in addition to listing the records that must be 16 produced, the Florida Supreme Court also said, and all 17 other evidence that bears on the reliability of the dog. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even worse. 19 MR. GIFFORD: So it's not a specific recipe, 20 and it's talking about what -- if these records exist, 21 they must be produced. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you conceding that 23 the Florida Supreme Court, at least with respect to the 24 field performance records, was wrong, that they -- it is 25 not a Fourth Amendment requirement?

GIFFORD: They said what the government 8 must produce if those records exist. But when you go 9 down to the part of the opinion where the court applies 10 the law to the facts, the court didn't just say, because 11 there were no field performance records, no probable 12 cause, we close up shop, conviction reversed. 13 What the court did was take into 14 consideration the lack of field performance records, the 15 lack of any records about initial training and 16 certification aside from the fact that this dog had a 17 certificate. 18 And we have to remember that this 19 certificate, not only was it 16 months out of date, it 20 wasn't a certificate for Aldo. It was a certificate for 21 Aldo and a Seminole County deputy together as a team. 22 This dog was never certified as part of a 23 team with Officer Wheetley in this case. And the 24 certifications in this area are team certifications, not 25 individual certifications.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a requirement too? 2 That's a constitutional requirement, that the dog 3 training doesn't count unless it's training with the 4 officer who is using the dog? 5 MR. GIFFORD: No, but that's an indicator of 6 reliability, which is the ultimate test here, has this 7 team been trained and certified together -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, fine. Counsel can 9 bring that up. Counsel can bring that up at the hearing 10 before the judge. But -- but I understood this to be 11 a -- a requirement. You never even get to that hearing, 12 because there's no evidence that this dog was ever 13 trained with this policeman. 14 MR. GIFFORD: That's correct, there is no 15 such evidence. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, and therefore end of 17 case, right? 18 MR. GIFFORD: No, not end of case. The fact 19 that the dog wasn't trained with this policeman means 20 that you need to look for evidence -- other evidence of 21 reliability, which also doesn't exist in this case. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Doesn't this -- this 24 officer has been working with this dog for many months. 25 They have training periods every week. So why isn't
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that enough to show that this handler and this dog 2 worked effectively as a team? 3 MR. GIFFORD: Well, first, this weekly 4 training is maintenance training. It's to maintain the 5 dog at a level of proficiency that has previously been 6 established. That level of proficiency hadn't been 7 established with this team of Wheetley and Aldo. The 8 level of proficiency that had been established was with 9 Wheetley and with another Seminole County deputy. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what -- what are 11 the -- what are the incentives here? Why would a police 12 department want to use an incompetent dog? Is that any 13 more likely than that a medical school would want to 14 certify an incompetent doctor? What -- what incentive 15 is there for a police department? 16 MR. GIFFORD: The incentive is to acquire 17 probable cause to search when it wouldn't otherwise -18 otherwise be available. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's a good thing? 20 MR. GIFFORD: Is that a good thing? 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you acquire 22 probable cause, you go in and there's nothing there. 23 You've wasted the time of your police officers, you've 24 wasted a lot of time. 25 MR. GIFFORD: And -- and you've invaded the
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 privacy of an individual motorist who was innocent. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe the police 3 department doesn't care about that, but it certainly 4 cares about wasting the time of its police officers in 5 fruitless searches. 6 MR. GIFFORD: The incentive of the officer 7 to be able to conduct a search when he doesn't otherwise 8 have probable cause is a powerful incentive. As the 9 Court has said, ferreting out crime is a competitive 10 enterprise. And also, these -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Willy-nilly. Officers just 12 like to search. They don't particularly want to search 13 where they're likely to find something. They just like 14 to search. So let's get dogs that, you know, smell 15 drugs when there are no drugs. You really think that 16 that's what's going on here? 17 MR. GIFFORD: Officers like -- officers like 18 to search so that they can get probable cause so that 19 they can advance their career. Forfeiture is also an 20 issue in this -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: They like to search where 22 they're likely to find something, and that only exists 23 when the dog is well trained. It seems to me they have 24 every incentive to train the dog well. 25 MR. GIFFORD: But the question goes back to
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the dog's reliability, what the officer knows 2 objectively, and what that officer can demonstrate on 3 the stand to the trial court to determine by the 4 totality of the circumstances that that dog is well 5 trained. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm -- getting back 7 to -- I'm confused about the difference between must and 8 is required. What if the judge has before him or her a 9 record, this is where the dog went to school and it's a 10 bona fide school, this is where the dog was certified, 11 he's trained every -- every, you know, couple of weeks 12 or whatever it is, and the judge says, do you have any 13 field records, and the officer says, no, and the 14 drug says -- the judge says, well, then no probable 15 cause. That's reversible error, right? 16 MR. GIFFORD: It is reversible error if we 17 know what went into the training and certification. Was 18 that training and certification sufficient to prove the 19 dog was reliable? Did it include the use of blanks and 20 did the -21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have, I guess, 22 experts testify about whether -- what constitutes a good 23 training program. 24 MR. GIFFORD: No, not necessarily experts, 25 but simply the -- the officer who participated with the
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 dog can testify as to what he and the dog went through 2 to obtain the training certificate and the -- and the 3 certification. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I assure you that if we 5 agree with you there will be a whole body of experts 6 that will spring into being about dog training. I 7 assure you that that will be the case. 8 MR. GIFFORD: Those experts already exist. 9 They -- they are prevalent in the case law already. 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understood the Florida 11 Supreme Court, counselor, to say that the deficit in the 12 training records here was because there was no evidence 13 of false positives, that the reports didn't say, the 14 training reports didn't say, if the dog was alerting 15 falsely. 16 Assume that the record, as your adversary 17 claimed, shows the opposite, that a satisfactory 18 completion means that the dog detected drugs where they 19 were. What -- why wouldn't the training records here be 20 adequate in that circumstance? 21 MR. GIFFORD: That would be one of several 22 showings that would make the training records adequate. 23 Also, you would want to know whether there were 24 distractors used in the field. However, I don't believe 25 that the record supports, except -- and this is
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 arguable; the parties dispute this -- for the 2 maintenance training. 3 All the state had for the initial training 4 with Deputy Morris, not with Deputy Wheetley, was a 5 certificate: One certificate that said this dog was 6 trained by the Apopka Police Department for 120 hours 7 with Deputy Morris; another certificate saying that this 8 dog was certified by Drug Beat narcotics certifications, 9 again with Deputy Morris, for 1 year. 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I guess what I'm 11 asking you is, as a matter of law you want us to hold 12 that training records are inadequate unless what? 13 Unless -- you're going to specify now a list of things 14 they have to include? 15 MR. GIFFORD: No. This Court in -- in a 16 number of circumstances has provided examples that can 17 guide a court in probable cause determinations. In 18 Illinois v. Gates, under the old Aguilar-Spinelli test, 19 the Court specified where evidence on one prong can be 20 so strong that it substitutes for evidence on another 21 prong. In Ornelas, the Court pointed to local knowledge 22 that can be relied upon, such as the winter climate in 23 Milwaukee. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but counsel, 25 you're defending a Florida Supreme Court opinion which
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 says "must." You can't just say, you know, I'm not 2 asserting any particular thing is necessary, just, you 3 know, totality of the circumstances. You have an 4 opinion here in which the Florida Supreme Court says 5 "must." It must include the, you know, the field 6 training. Now, do -- do you disavow that or -- or do 7 you want us the ignore it? What? 8 MR. GIFFORD: That is -- that is not the 9 holding on which I'm relying here. The holding on which 10 I'm relying is that training and certification alone, 11 the mere fact of training and certification alone, is 12 not sufficient to establish the dog's reliability. 13 And as to the language about "must," 14 remember, the Florida Supreme Court didn't just say that 15 the failure to produce one of these elements 16 necessitated reversal. 17 It then went and engaged in a totality of 18 the circumstances test. And several lower courts 19 applying that case, applying Harris, have reached the 20 same conclusion. In two of those cases -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if this is absent in 22 the totality of the circumstances and you nonetheless 23 hold that there was probable cause, then "must" does not 24 mean "must," right? 25 MR. GIFFORD: "Must" means "must" if the

1 state has the records. If the records exist, then the 2 state must produce them because it bears the -3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not what the 4 Florida Supreme Court said? It listed, along with 5 training, that the -- the provision of records of field 6 performance. 7 MR. GIFFORD: I read that as: If those 8 records exist, the state must produce them, because not 9 only does it bear the burden of proof; it's the only 10 party that can produce these records because it keeps 11 the dog. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose it's -- it's a 13 dog that's just completed the training, training course, 14 top-performing dog in the training program, but there's 15 no field record. 16 MR. GIFFORD: If that -- if the training is 17 sufficient, if it has those elements that demonstrate 18 that the dog is reliable, those are the circumstances. 19 You have the totality of the circumstances there and 20 those circumstances don't include any field performance. 21 And, yes, under that circumstance, a trial court can 22 find the dog to be reliable. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: What is wrong with the 24 state's argument that field performance records are not 25 very probative because dogs detect odors, they don't
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 detect the physical presence of the substance that 2 created the odor, and therefore so-called false alerts, 3 cases in which a search was performed and no contraband 4 was found are not really cases of false alerts. What's 5 wrong with that? 6 MR. GIFFORD: Well, you don't know whether 7 they're cases of false alerts or not, because the state 8 will always point to the possibility of residual odor as 9 a reason. And we know from the studies that have been 10 cited in the briefs that there are other reasons that 11 dogs alert when that alert cannot be verified. Handler 12 cueing is identified as the chief one. And simply dogs 13 make mistakes. Dogs err. Dogs get excited and will 14 alert to things like tennis balls in trunks or animals, 15 that sort of thing. 16 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that may all be true, 17 but then what -- what can one infer from the fact that a 18 dog alerted a number of times when no contraband was 19 found? 20 I think what you just said was the 21 explanation could be the dog detected an odor, but the 22 substance wasn't there, or it could be that the dog was 23 cued or the dog was confused or the dog is not very 24 competent. So what can one infer from these field 25 performance records?
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. GIFFORD: Well, what you can infer is
 2 this dog is not a very accurate indicator of probable
 3 cause, because probable cause tests whether drugs are
 4 likely to be found in a search that follows an alert.
 5 If the dog's -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they are likely to be 7 found if there is a residual odor of drugs, even though 8 the drugs are no longer there. So it's not an 9 incompetent dog when he alerts because of the residual 10 odor. 11 MR. GIFFORD: But if a dog has -- but if a 12 dog has previously alerted and no drugs have been found 13 because the dog's hyperacuity causes him to smell drugs 14 that were there two days or two weeks ago, then the next 15 time that dog alerts, it's less likely, the probability 16 declines that drugs will be found. 17 It goes to what probable cause measures, 18 rather than what the dog training and certification 19 community measure, and that is, the likelihood, the 20 reasonable probability, that drugs will be found 21 following the search. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, how is that any 23 different than a police officer who comes to a car and 24 smells marijuana? He's never going to know whether 25 there is any more in the car or not. It could have been
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 smoked up an hour before. I don't know how long 2 marijuana lingers for, but -- I'm not sure why residual 3 odor affects the reliability of the dog, which was 4 Justice Scalia's point. It's no different than an 5 officer who smells something. 6 He doesn't actually know whether it's 7 physically still present or not, but we're talking about 8 probabilities. 9 MR. GIFFORD: That's correct. And -- and 10 the difference is that -- that the police officer can 11 describe what he has smelled and can say, I smell 12 marijuana. All the dog tells the police officer is, I 13 smell something I was trained to detect, perhaps, if I'm 14 operating correctly. 15 But getting to this -- this issue of 16 residual odor, our position is that an alert where no 17 drugs are found means that the dog -- that -- it 18 detracts from probable cause in that instance. 19 But that's not the only rule available to 20 the court. Residual odor, whether an alert was to 21 residual odor and is therefore correct and accurate, is 22 something that can be litigated. 23 In one of the lower courts that decided the 24 case after the Florida Supreme Court, the court looked 25 to the field performance records, and it found several
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 of them well supported on the issue of whether the alert 2 was probably to the odor of drugs; several it didn't 3 find. So that is an issue that can be litigated. 4 Another possibility is -5 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, excuse me. 6 Where -- when nothing is found, how can you tell whether 7 the dog alerted to a residual odor or simply made a 8 mistake? 9 Now, there may be cases where there is other 10 evidence that suggests that drugs were present in that 11 location, and, therefore, that is something from which 12 you could infer that the dog was alerting to residual 13 odor; but, the fact that you don't have evidence of that 14 doesn't mean that there wasn't residual odor. 15 MR. GIFFORD: No, it doesn't mean that there 16 wasn't residual odor. But, again, you go back to what 17 probable cause measures, I believe. 18 And the Florida Supreme Court didn't demand 19 evidence of residual odor. What it did is it said that 20 if field performance records exist, then the state can 21 explain unverified alerts in the field as residual odor, 22 and then a court can then evaluate that. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's the magic 24 number? What percentage of accurate alerts or 25 inaccurate is enough for probable cause?
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. GIFFORD: Well, this Court has always 2 hesitated to assign percentages to probable cause; but, 3 in the lower courts, once you get below 50 percent, 4 probable cause is much less likely to be found, assuming 5 that there is no other corroborative evidence, no other 6 reasonable suspicion factors. 7 I'd like to talk briefly about the Oregon 8 supreme court and what that court did in several cases. 9 Helzer and Foster decided in 2011, 10 independently of the Florida Supreme Court decision, 11 doesn't cite Harris; in Foster, the Oregon supreme court 12 had a dog that trained initially with the same handler, 13 unlike here, where the evidence was very strong as to 14 the features of the training and certification program, 15 and where that dog had, I believe, a 66 percent field 16 performance record. 17 Now, the court in Foster said that the dog's 18 reliability can be established by training, 19 certification, and performance in the field. The court 20 added that it didn't think that performance in the field 21 was the most reliable measure, but it's relevant, and 22 the court considered that 66 percent percentage. 23 But then, on the same day, in Helzer, there 24 was a dog that trained initially with a different 25 handler, that the handler ultimately testified to very
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 few details of the ongoing training and the
 2 certification.
 3 In Foster, the certification was with an
 4 organization that required a 90 percent success rate.
 5 In Helzer, there was no such testimony.
 6 And this officer, like the officer here,
 7 didn't keep field performance records when the dog
 8 alerted and no drugs were found.
 9 In Helzer, the court found that there was
 10 insufficient evidence of reliability. And I believe 11 that those two cases demonstrate what is a -- what is a 12 correct line to draw in navigating what is reliable. 13 On several arguments made by the state, the 14 argument was that the maintenance training included 15 blanks, and that the dog did not alert to blanks. The 16 record, we believe, supports the Florida supreme court's 17 conclusion that blanks were tested -- the dog was tested 18 on blanks, but there was no testimony as to whether the 19 dog didn't alert on those blanks. 20 The state has said that the dog was 21 subsequently recertified. I don't find support in the 22 record for that. At a suppression hearing, the state 23 argued -- the officer testified that the dog was 24 scheduled for another certification, but we don't know 25 whether the dog was ever recertified.
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 The Court can affirm the Florida Supreme 2 Court simply on the failure to produce adequate 3 documentation of certification and initial training, and 4 on the fact that this dog was never certified with this 5 trainer -- with this handler and didn't initially work 6 with this handler. 7 You don't have a dog here who was reliable 8 enough to demonstrate probable cause. The Florida 9 Supreme Court so concluded. I believe its conclusion 10 was correct. And unless there are additional 11 questions... 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The alert -- the alert 13 here could have been to residual odor, or it could have 14 been to drugs inside the pickup truck. If it's -15 because the alert was in front of the -- a front door 16 handle, is that -- so it -- it's equally likely that 17 it -- that it was just residual odor or that there were 18 drugs inside the pickup truck. 19 Can the police establish probable cause 20 when what the dog alerted to may well have been residual 21 odor and nothing inside? The dog didn't alert anyplace 22 other than the door handle, is that... 23 MR. GIFFORD: It can constitute probable 24 cause. What Officer Wheetley testified to in this case 25 was he believed that this alert was to residual odor
47

Official
1 on the door handle -2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me. Did you say it 3 can or it can't? 4 MR. GIFFORD: It may. It may. It can 5 constitute probable cause in this case. 6 Officer Wheetley testified that this dog 7 alerted to the door handle. And in his prior 8 experience, when the dog alerts to the door handle, it 9 means that someone who had smoked or consumed drugs or 10 handled drugs had touched the door handle. 11 Now, if Officer Wheetley had testified that 12 in his experience when he'd seen such alerts and 13 conducted a search, drugs were found inside the vehicle, 14 then that residual odor alert would support probable 15 cause. 16 Officer Wheetley did not so testify. There 17 was insufficient evidence that this residual odor 18 alert -- that a residual odor alert of this nature, 19 without finding drugs afterward, supports probable 20 cause. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: But at least we don't have 22 to worry about mothballs in this case; is that right? 23 There are no mothballs? 24 (Laughter.) 25 MR.

1 knowledge. No, Your Honor. 2 JUSTICE ALITO: Was that the holding in the 3 Florida Supreme Court, that there was no probable cause 4 because the dog alerted to the wrong part of the truck? 5 MR. GIFFORD: No, Your Honor. 6 JUSTICE ALITO: Was it any part of their 7 reasoning? 8 MR. GIFFORD: They were concerned about 9 residual odor alerting without any explanation by the 10 state as to how residual odor alerting supports probable 11 cause. 12 But the primary basis for its decision was 13 the lack of performance records and the lack of records 14 supporting initial training and certification to show 15 that this dog was reliable. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if we think they were 17 wrong in that respect, I suppose that you would say the 18 Court shouldn't reverse, but should vacate and remand 19 because the question did alert him to the door handle, 20 was that enough? Was that enough to establish probable 21 cause that there were drugs in the vehicle? 22 MR. GIFFORD: Well, I don't think the door 23 handle itself is -- is dispositive. I think it's the 24 door handle plus the lack of evidence that we have a 25 reliable dog.

1 And, again, the reason you need a reliable 2 dog, evidence on what training and certification means, 3 is that there are no standards, no standards whatsoever 4 for initial training. 5 Some states do have standards for training 6 and certification. Florida does not. And no standards 7 for -- for maintenance training as well. 8 In order to have probable cause, you have to 9 know what that certification, what that training means, 10 if you don't have standards that will tell that for you. 11 If there are no additional questions, I'll 12 conclude. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 14 Mr. Garre, you have 3 minutes. 15 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE 16 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 17 MR. GARRE: Thank you, Your Honor. 18 First, probable cause in this Court's 19 precedents looks not only to the likelihood that 20 contraband would be present, but the likelihood that 21 there would be evidence of a crime. And that would 22 include the so-called residual odor, evidence that drug 23 paraphernalia, someone had recently smoked illegal 24 narcotics in the vehicle, or the like. 25 So the alert to the so-called residual odor

1 of drugs is just as probative to the question of
 2 probable cause as an alert to drugs themselves.
 3 The fact that Aldo alerted to the door
 4 handle area of the car doesn't negate in any way the
 5 probable cause that Officer Wheetley had to search. 6 What it means is that the door handle area was where the 7 scent of the illegal narcotics was the strongest. It 8 could have been narcotics coming out of that area, or 9 coming out of the door seam, or could have been the fact 10 that someone who had used narcotics was using the door 11 handle to get in and out of the car. 12 Second, courts can determine reliability in 13 this context. They would look to the performance in the 14 controlled training environment. There is a real danger 15 with suggesting that field performance records are -16 are a permissible foray for defendants in suppression 17 hearings to challenge the reliability of dogs because, 18 one, as Justice Alito pointed out, it's not a controlled 19 setting. 20 We don't know whether the dog did alert to 21 residual odors of narcotics that had been in the car, 22 drugs that were hidden and simply not found during 23 the relatively -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would you -- would you 25 allow counsel to ask about that?

1 MR. GARRE: I think they could ask about it, 2 Your Honor. I don't think they could demand the 3 performance records themselves. And that would be a 4 huge deterrent to law enforcement, even maintaining 5 those records. 6 Third, Officer Wheetley and Aldo did train 7 together for nearly a year before the search in 8 question. They did complete the 40-hour drug detection 9 seminar at the Dothan, Alabama, police department. And 10 that certificate's at page 105 of the record. 11 And second, as Justice Scalia pointed out, 12 all the incentives in this area are aligned with 13 ensuring the reliability of drug detection dogs. It's 14 not in the police interest to have a dog that is 15 inaccurate in finding contraband or that is inaccurate 16 and putting an officer in harm's way. 17 Humans have relied upon dogs for law 18 enforcement-related purposes, due to their extraordinary 19 sense of smell, for centuries. Dogs, trained drug 20 detection dogs and explosive detection dogs, are 21 invaluable members of the law enforcement community 22 today. 23 We would ask the Court to reverse the 24 decision below, which would act as a serious detriment 25 to the use of that valuable tool.
