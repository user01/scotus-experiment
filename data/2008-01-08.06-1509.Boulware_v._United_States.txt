1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:52 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in Case 06-1509, Boulware v. United States. 5 Mr. Cline. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. CLINE 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. CLINE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 9 please the Court: 10 Congress placed the phrase "with respect to 11 its stock" in Section 301(a) of the Internal Revenue 12 Code to make clear that the taxation rules in Section 13 301(c) do not apply to corporate payments that a 14 shareholder receives in a nonshareholder capacity. 15 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you a question 16 which is going to come up sooner or later? And it's 17 kind of a threshold question. So, if I may, let me 18 interrupt you with it now. You emphasize the 19 significance of the limiting condition "with respect to 20 the stock." But before you get to that phrase, Section 21 301 refers to a distribution by the corporation. And my 22 question is this: Let's assume that we -- we accept 23 your -- your position that the circuit was wrong in 24 requiring an offer of proof of intent to return capital. 25 Isn't it also the case that you would still have an
3

Alderson Reporting Company

1 obligation, if you're going to take advantage of this 2 section, to offer some evidence with respect to the fact 3 that there was a corporate distribution involved? And 4 as I understand it, your evidence is or the Government's 5 evidence and yours is that, you know, there was 6 skimming, there was misdirection, et cetera, but there 7 was no indication, there's no evidence that there was 8 any distribution, in the normal sense of that word, by a 9 corporation. 10 So it seems to me that if you -- if you win 11 the case in the sense of convincing us that the circuit 12 was wrong with respect to the specific intent 13 requirement, you would still be left without a defense 14 because you have not come forward with any evidence that 15 indicates a distribution. Am I wrong? 16 MR. CLINE: Yes, Your Honor, I believe you 17 are. 18 JUSTICE SOUTER: I thought you were going to 19 say that. 20 (Laughter.) 21 MR. CLINE: Although I agree that the 22 question of a distribution is important, and I think 23 implicit in that question, in that term, although the 24 courts have not addressed it, is some sort of corporate 25 action. Where you have a controlling shareholder, as we
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 do here with Mr. Boulware, who is a 50 percent share 2 owner, he's the president, he's the founder, he 3 dominates this company, his action is action on behalf 4 of the corporation. 5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it certainly can be, 6 and there's no question about that, but isn't there some 7 point of informality or some point, I guess, of 8 formality or relevance to corporate practice that has to 9 be reached? In other words, he may keep lousy books, he 10 may be very sloppy, but directing funds to one's 11 girlfriend is not the act of a corporation. And it 12 seems to me that the kind of -- of actions that he took 13 to get or to direct the payment of moneys could not, by 14 any stretch of the imagination, be regarded as an act of 15 this corporation or of any corporation. 16 MR. CLINE: With respect, Justice Souter, 17 Justice Souter, I disagree. There are, I've discovered, 18 hundreds of corporate diversion cases involving a very 19 similar fact pattern and a very similar fact pattern to 20 this, where have you a corporation that is really the 21 creature of one person. It's formed by one person. He 22 chose the corporate form, but in effect he is the 23 corporation. That's the case of Mr. Boulware and it's 24 the case in a lot of these diversion cases, and -25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in this case, he's a
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 50 percent owner, as I understand it. He formed the 2 corporation, but isn't 50 percent of the stock owned by 3 the trust for the love child of him and the girlfriend? 4 MR. CLINE: It is indeed, although it's 5 important to keep in mind that the girlfriend, according 6 to the Government's evidence, received a very large 7 chunk of this money. So in effect what we have here is 8 a situation where you not only have a 50 percent 9 shareholder who dominates the corporation; the other 50 10 percent -- the trustee for the other 50 percent 11 shareholder is the recipient of the money and is 12 certainly knowledgeable about most, if not all, of 13 what's going on. 14 But in these circumstances where you have a 15 close corporation typically run very informally, as this 16 one was, with one person who dominates it, the courts 17 have uniformly taken the view that, the Tax Court has 18 and for that matter the Government has in every case 19 except this one, that when the controlling dominant 20 shareholder takes money from his corporation, that's a 21 distribution by the corporation. And although -- Your 22 Honor, I had thought about this question myself before 23 you raised it. The cases don't pause on that issue. 24 They move directly to the question of whether it's taken 25 in some other capacity, as compensation, for example, or
6

1 as a loan. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, perhaps because -3 because the Government might very well be on the other 4 side of that question, that is the dominant shareholder 5 takes money from the corporation, gives it to his 6 girlfriend, and the Government is saying that 7 corporation had earnings and profits, we want to tax 8 this as a dividend to you. 9 MR. CLINE: Well, yes, Justice Ginsburg. 10 The way this often comes up, the Government usually 11 takes the opposite position -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 13 MR. CLINE: -- to what it's taken here. It 14 usually takes our position, and here's the reason why: 15 First of all, a lot of times, as in this case, some of 16 the money that is coming toward the corporation is 17 intercepted by the controlling shareholder. And the 18 question then is, was it ever income to the corporation? 19 Well, of course, the Government wants to say that it was 20 because they want to tax it twice, at the corporate 21 level and then again at the individual level. And the 22 issue there again is one of control. If it's the 23 controlling shareholder, even though he gets the money 24 before it ever hits the corporate bank account. It's 25 considered income to the corporation.

1 It also comes up when the corporation wants 2 to claim a theft deduction or embezzlement deduction. 3 That again is a common fact pattern in these cases. The 4 corporation -- everything comes to light, the IRS 5 conducts its investigation, now the corporation wants to 6 avoid its tax. Sure the individual is going to get 7 taxed, but it wants to avoid its tax. And so, it claims 8 that there was a theft or an embezzlement by the 9 shareholder and it's entitled to a deduction and 10 shouldn't have to pay tax on that money. 11 And again, the Government uniformly takes 12 the position that a controlling shareholder, such as 13 Mr. Boulware, can't embezzle from his own corporation, 14 which is essentially the position that we're taking 15 here. 16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it may be that he 17 cannot embezzle in the sense of committing a separate 18 private act or even a separate, a separate tort that the 19 corporation could object to. But the question still 20 remains -- excuse me -- whether the act of, of taking 21 the money in this unorthodox way could be regarded as a 22 corporate act within the meaning of the term 23 "distribution." And I think I understand your point, 24 but I guess the only point that I'm making is the fact 25 that it may not qualify as embezzlement, civilly or

1 criminally, does not necessarily answer the objection 2 that I'm raising. 3 MR. CLINE: I agree with that point, Justice 4 Souter. 5 But one other point I would emphasize is 6 that I think if you start to say that an act by the 7 controlling shareholder, which is Mr. Boulware, does not 8 constitute a distribution by his corporation, there are 9 going to be unintended consequences of that. One of 10 which is that in a situation where a controlling 11 shareholder such as Mr. Boulware intercepts money coming 12 into the corporation, you're going to have the 13 corporation coming in and arguing that that 14 interception, that taking in of money wasn't an act of 15 the corporation, and so, there is no income to us. And 16 I think that's why the courts in a whole series -17 JUSTICE SOUTER: That explains why I'm 18 making the argument and the Government wasn't in its 19 brief? 20 MR. CLINE: I think it does. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you did say something 22 about the interception that -- your argument is that 23 this corporation had no earnings and profits, so what 24 the shareholder got was a return of capital. But part 25 of what was involved was he was taking, I thought,
9

1 receipts for goods that customers were -- had paid and 2 giving them to the girlfriend. 3 In determining whether that corporation had 4 any earnings and profits, wouldn't you have to credit 5 the corporation? In other words, did you prove that 6 there was no -- that there were no earnings and profits? 7 You would have to prove that, wouldn't you? 8 MR. CLINE: The way I believe it would work 9 with a properly instructed jury in the district court is 10 as follows: I think Mr. Boulware would have the burden 11 of coming forward with some evidence that the 12 corporation did not have earnings or profits and that 13 his basis exceeded the amount of the diversion. I think 14 at that point, if he comes forward with some evidence, 15 and Bok talks about this, Leonard talks about this -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: For which purpose you'd 17 include the receipts? 18 MR. CLINE: I beg your pardon? 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: For which purpose you would 20 include the receipts that he sent to his girlfriend 21 instead of putting them in the corporate treasury? 22 MR. CLINE: Your Honor, I believe that is 23 correct, but I'm not certain. What I can tell you about 24 earnings and profits and basis as well is this. It is a 25 very complicated calculation, and I think it would be
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 hotly disputed in the district court. I would expect 2 the Government to argue that the company did have 3 earnings and profits and that Mr. Boulware's basis is 4 less than he contends it is. I think it would 5 ultimately be a question of fact for the jury. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I also wanted to know 7 whether there is in the record the corporation's balance 8 sheet? It was frankly hard for me to believe that this 9 was not in excess of basis. You don't usually 10 capitalize corporations for $10 million. But I don't 11 have any basis other than just an assumption to make 12 that observation. Is the corporate balance sheet with 13 the capital structure in the record? 14 MR. CLINE: I don't believe so, Your Honor. 15 But what is in the record, and it's also in the joint 16 appendix, is the fairly sketchy evidence of both basis 17 and earnings and profits that was introduced. But there 18 was not a full presentation of those issues. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was it introduced by the 20 Government or by the defendant? 21 MR. CLINE: It came in -- I must say it came 22 in more or less by happenstance, because neither party 23 was really looking at the question of earnings and 24 profits or basis because the trial court had ruled those 25 out. But, for example, on cross-examination I believe
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of Mr. Boulware's accountant -- this is at page 42 of 2 the joint appendix -- Mr. Boulware's lawyer elicited 3 that the corporation had not had earnings and profits 4 during the years in question. That was not explored at 5 all. But there is that statement in the record. 6 There is also -- I'm sorry, Your Honor. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not, I'm not sure if 8 what the Government is maintaining here is so 9 prejudicial to its position in other cases, which was 10 the earlier discussion we were having. Here there is 11 simply nothing on the corporate records to show that 12 this was a distribution with respect to stock. I don't 13 care whether this is earnings and profits or in excess 14 of basis. But there's just no indication of the 15 distribution with respect to stock, and you have two 16 shareholders. Under Hawaiian law, can you make a 17 disproportionate distribution to shareholders so one 18 person gets capital back and the other doesn't and 19 there's no redemption of shares? 20 MR. CLINE: I think it is entirely possible 21 that under Hawaiian law a minority shareholder or 22 noncontrolling shareholder who was treated unfairly by 23 the controlling shareholder might have a cause of action 24 under State law. But I -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That was, that was the
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 qualification that the Second Circuit made in its 2 D'Agostino case. It said if there's a violation of 3 corporate law then our rule doesn't apply. 4 MR. CLINE: Well, except, Your Honor, that 5 the way these cases have played out is that there are 6 numerous cases, dozens of them, where there are minority 7 shareholders oftentimes unwitting of what the majority 8 shareholder is using. Those minority shareholders 9 certainly have rights. They can sue under State law. 10 They can do any number of things. 11 But their rights and the possible violation 12 of their rights -- and I emphasize possible, because no 13 one has ever established that Mr. Boulware did anything 14 wrong with respect to anyone -- those don't drive the 15 Federal tax treatment. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's the whole 17 point. The fact that he doesn't show this as a 18 distribution indicates that he couldn't do this under 19 Federal law, so it must be something -- under State law, 20 so it must be something other than a distribution. 21 MR. CLINE: I think, Your Honor, that where 22 the controlling shareholder of the corporation does 23 something with corporate funds, and in this case 24 transfers them to himself, I think that's a 25 distribution. And I think that it is properly treated
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 under Federal law, under Federal tax law, for purposes 2 of Federal tax law as a distribution by the corporation. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm less concerned with the 4 word "distribution" in the statute than I am with the 5 phrase "with respect to its stock" -- "distribution made 6 by a corporation to a shareholder with respect to its 7 stock." 8 Now, the court below held that there had to 9 be a conscious intent to return capital. Even if I 10 disagree with that and think that that was wrong, isn't 11 the Government right that it nonetheless is the burden 12 to establish that the distribution here was a 13 distribution with respect to stock, and the distribution 14 was given to the girlfriend who owns no stock in the 15 corporation. How does it become a distribution with 16 respect to stock? 17 MR. CLINE: Well, Your Honor, that gets back 18 to where I -- to where I began the argument. The phrase 19 "with respect to stock" has never received in any case 20 or any argument, as far as I know, the significance that 21 the Government is trying to accord it here. What that 22 phrase -- it was put in the 1954 Code. And the purpose 23 of putting it in the code was simply to distinguish 24 transfers to shareholders in a capacity where the 25 shareholder is effectively returning consideration --
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 shareholder employees, shareholder vendors, shareholder 2 creditors -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or girlfriends. I mean, 4 why doesn't it distinguish a girlfriend as much as it 5 distinguishes an employee who's receiving back a loan? 6 MR. CLINE: Because the issue, Your Honor, 7 is not the recipient of the funds. I mean, the money is 8 going to be taxed to Mr. Boulware if it's taxable 9 regardless of where he diverted it. For example, there 10 are again dozens of these cases where controlling 11 shareholders divert corporate assets to their family 12 members, and the issue is whether it's a constructive 13 dividend to that corporate shareholder. Here the 14 question, regardless of where Mr. Boulware -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the Government would 16 say yes? 17 MR. CLINE: Absolutely. The Government in 18 every case says yes. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, they're really -20 they're really between a rock and a hard place on this 21 stuff. 22 MR. CLINE: Well, because, Your Honor, they 23 want -- they want the controlling shareholder, the 24 person in Mr. Boulware's situation, to pay tax. And, of 25 course in most cases -- in most cases, again, it's to
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the Government's advantage to argue the position that 2 we're arguing here. And the reason is most corporations 3 have earnings and profits. Most shareholders don't have 4 enough basis to cover their tax until the Government 5 wants to hit it at both levels, it wants the corporate 6 tax and it wants the individual tax. And so, it argues 7 readily that this is a distribution with respect to 8 stock. 9 That phrase was -- was put in the 1954 Code 10 to distinguish one capacity from another. The 11 Government has argued that it should receive some sort 12 of a causal type meaning. There should be a causal 13 link, that Mr. Boulware should have to establish that he 14 received the stock because he was a shareholder. 15 If that's the standard, first of all, it's a 16 different standard than what the district court and the 17 Ninth Circuit required Mr. Boulware to meet. So he 18 ought to have a chance to satisfy the standard. 19 Second, that standard doesn't necessarily 20 require any form of intent. There's nothing in the 21 phrase "with respect to stock" that talks about intent. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We don't -- and this 23 may be the point that you just made, but I want to 24 clarify it. We don't have to decide whether this 25 diversion was with respect to stock, because you put
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that at issue, and you weren't allowed to make that -2 MR. CLINE: Absolutely, Your Honor. What -3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose it would 4 be open on remand for the Government to argue it was not 5 with respect to stock for the reasons that have come 6 out, that it was just a diversion? 7 MR. CLINE: The Government could argue that, 8 but, Mr. Chief Justice, I have to say I -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: You are pretty sure they 10 won't. 11 MR. CLINE: I would be astounded if they 12 took that position, because it would be so contrary to 13 the position they take in every other case. 14 But to get back to your basic point, yes, 15 Mr. Boulware was asked to meet a standard that no one 16 defends in this Court. The Government isn't here 17 defending the intent to have a return of capital 18 standard. And part of the reason they don't defend it 19 is it's an impossible concept. You don't know if you 20 have a return of capital until you know if you have a 21 dividend. And you don't know that until -- until the 22 end of the tax year. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the -- the 24 Government did say that this accountant -- what was his 25 name, Monango, or something like that?
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. CLINE: Monago, yes. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Testified at the trial 3 that there was no return of capital in the relevant 4 year. 5 MR. CLINE: What Mr. Monago testified to was 6 that there weren't any payments out of the capital 7 account, and that's undisputed. But that's not the 8 question. 9 Those sorts of corporate formalities are not 10 determinative, or even particularly helpful, in these 11 constructive dividend types of cases. 12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under the 13 Government's intent test, I suppose if you have a 14 calendar year and the distribution is made in June, that 15 the Government could say: What we want to show -- we 16 want you to show that there was an intent to make a 17 distribution with respect to stock at that time. 18 Whether or not it was a dividend, whether or 19 not it was a return of capital, we won't know until the 20 end of the year. I suppose they could try to argue 21 that. 22 MR. CLINE: That is what they're arguing. 23 Now, two things about that Justice Kennedy: 24 First, that's not the standard Mr. Boulware 25 was required to meet in the district court. The
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 standard there was intent that it be a return of 2 capital. And that's a different thing than an intent 3 that it be with respect to stock. 4 An intent that it be a return of capital 5 suggests that you know what a return of capital is. You 6 know about earnings and profits. You know about basis. 7 And I can tell you that Mr. Boulware, who was an 8 unsophisticated man, didn't know any of those things at 9 the time; and so, of course, he couldn't meet the 10 standard he was required to meet. If this Court were to 11 agree with the Government that -12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean to say the 13 Government can't argue that this -- the Defendant has to 14 show that it was a distribution with respect to stock 15 and that that was his intent. Whether or not it was a 16 dividend, whether or not it was a return of capital, we 17 wait. 18 MR. CLINE: I don't think that's the right 19 standard, but even if this Court decides that it is, 20 that's not the standard Mr. Boulware was required to 21 meet in the trial court. He was required to show an 22 intent that it be a return of capital, and he couldn't 23 meet that standard. 24 If this Court were to decide -- and I 25 suggest it would be the wrong standard, but if this
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 court were to decide that the correct standard were an 2 intent that it be with respect to stock, Mr. Boulware 3 could meet that standard. 4 He was never given the opportunity to meet 5 it before, but he could meet that if this Court were to 6 decide that that was the standard in the sense that he 7 could certainly show that, to the extent he got this 8 money personally, he got it because he was a 9 stockholder. And he knew he was getting it because he 10 was a stockholder. 11 But he never had a chance to meet the 12 standard, because it wasn't the standard that the 13 Government urged in the trial court or even before the 14 panel on appeal. 15 Unless the Court has further questions, I'd 16 like to reserve the remainder of my time. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 18 Mr. Cline. 19 Ms. Maynard. 20 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD 21 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 22 MS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 23 please the Court: 24 In the Government's view, to make a 25 sufficient proffer of a return of capital defense a
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Defendant must point to some factual evidence to support 2 three elements: 3 First, that there was a distribution with 4 respect to stock. Second, that the corporation lacked 5 earnings and profits during the relevant tax years. 6 And, third, that the Defendant had a sufficient basis in 7 his stock to cover the funds received. 8 The question before this Court relates to 9 the first element. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: The court below didn't give 11 him a chance -12 MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to establish that. The 14 court below required him to show an intent to distribute 15 capital. 16 MS. MAYNARD: And the Government here 17 believes that the correct test is the rule of the Ninth 18 Circuit, Your Honor. The Government believes that 19 before a defendant may present a return of capital 20 defense to the jury, there must be some evidence that 21 the corporation intended, as objectively inferred from 22 all the facts and circumstances, to make a distribution 23 with respect to its stock at the time the funds were 24 taken. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if it turned out that
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 there were earnings and profits and everything else was 2 the same, would the Government be taking the position 3 that the proper test is: Was this a distribution with 4 respect to stock? 5 MS. MAYNARD: In -- in every case, Your 6 Honor, the question about whether or not the Section 301 7 tax treatment applies, the Government believes that 8 turns on all the facts and circumstances and that there 9 must be some facts and circumstances suggesting that it 10 was a distribution with respect to stock. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the government -12 the corporation is rich with earnings and profits. 13 Would the Government be saying: Oh, aha. So we have to 14 go through the motions of first seeing was this a 15 distribution with respect to stock? 16 I thought that the idea of was it "a 17 distribution with respect to stock" refers to was it -18 was the corporation -- was there to be any quid pro quo? 19 That is, the shareholder gets money from the 20 corporation. Is the shareholder expected to pay it 21 back, or is it just that it comes out of the corporation 22 into the shareholder's pocket with no expectation by the 23 corporation to get it back? 24 I thought that that's what "with respect to 25 stock" means instead of "with respect to salary," "with
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 respect to a loan." That's what I thought was the 2 understanding of the term. Am I wrong about it? 3 MS. MAYNARD: That is half of the 4 understanding of the term. I do think it is, as 5 Petitioner says, a term of art. There are two parts to 6 the term of art with respect to stock, Your Honor. 7 It is, as you say, funds that you receive 8 without consideration. But it is also funds that you 9 receive solely because of your status as a shareholder. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that was -- we're just 11 not on the same page here. That's not what the -- the 12 decision you're defending said. 13 The decision you're defending did not say 14 that it was incumbent on the defendant to show that it 15 was with respect to stock. They said it was incumbent 16 on the defendant to show that it was intended to be a 17 return of capital. 18 MS. MAYNARD: Well, that's -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's just a wholly 20 different issue, and it seems to me the best you can get 21 out of this case, the way you're arguing it, is a remand 22 for them to apply the proper test. 23 MS. MAYNARD: I think the test that I'm 24 articulating is the Ninth Circuit's test in this 25 circumstance, Your Honor. In Miller, which is the
23

1 genesis of the Ninth Circuit's test, the court said -2 and this is on page 545 at 1214 -- "We, therefore, 3 conclude that whether diverted funds constitute 4 constructive corporate distributions" -- and that would 5 include dividends, return of capital, or capital gain -6 "depends on the factual circumstances involved in each 7 case under consideration." 8 And then it went on to say, before a 9 defendant could proffer a defense of return of capital, 10 the taxpayer had to make some demonstration that this -11 such distributions were intended to be such a return of 12 capital -13 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it depends on what 14 you mean by that. The Ninth Circuit said, quote, about 15 what he has to show, that he has to show not merely that 16 the funds could have been a return of capital, but that 17 the funds were, in fact, the return of capital "at the 18 time of transfer." 19 Then, they go on to say, since there was no 20 evidence that they were considered, intended or recorded 21 on the corporate records as a return of capital at the 22 time they were made, then it isn't a return of capital. 23 Now, I thought everybody thinks that's 24 wrong, because you might have an absolute distribution 25 that absolutely counts as a distribution to every

1 shareholder in the corporation. And at the time they 2 all think the company's going to make a billion dollars, 3 but it just turns out that they have a loss of a billion 4 dollars, in which case at the end of the tax year that 5 would count as a return of capital if the basis were 6 high enough, and it would not count as a dividend. Am I 7 wrong? 8 MS. MAYNARD: No. You may not know at the 9 time the funds are paid whether or not that -10 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, fine. So if we 11 do not know, that's the end of the Ninth Circuit test, 12 isn't it? Because the Ninth Circuit test says: What we 13 want to do is to look at the books at the time of the 14 distribution and see if it is entered on those books as 15 a return of capital. That's how I read it. 16 MS. MAYNARD: If you -- if you -- it would 17 be more accurate to say: At the time, was it intended, 18 as objectively manifested from all the facts and 19 circumstances, to be a distribution -20 JUSTICE BREYER: No. No. It was not. What 21 they thought at the time they distributed it was 22 fabulous dividends because we are going to be rich. 23 MS. MAYNARD: But if -24 JUSTICE BREYER: My example was they just 25 made a little mistake. Instead, the corporation is
25

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 close to bankrupt, so there are no earnings or profits. 2 Is it then a return of capital or not? 3 MS. MAYNARD: It could be a return of 4 capital depending on the person's stock. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: The basis? He has more 6 than enough basis. He has a $14 trillion basis, okay? 7 So there is no problem about that. 8 MS. MAYNARD: But here he -- the defendant 9 -10 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And so it is a 11 return of capital. So, therefore, the test is wrong. 12 MS. MAYNARD: It would be a return -- but 13 the point, Your Honor, is that the test is whether or 14 not at the time the funds were taken, the corporation 15 intended to be making a distribution with respect to its 16 stock. 17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, aren't you -- aren't 18 you saying not that the -- that the test of intent that 19 the Ninth Circuit used is, in itself, a sufficient test; 20 but that, rather -- and correct me if I'm wrong, because 21 I thought this was the basis really of your argument. 22 I thought the Government, in effect, was 23 saying in order to treat it as a return of capital, it 24 is a necessary condition that it be intended to be 25 treated as a return of capital.
26

1 But that is not a sufficient condition, 2 because if, in fact, it turns out, as in Justice 3 Breyer's example, that there are no earnings, then under 4 301 it can't be treated as -- as a dividend. And only 5 then, under 301, would it be treated as a return of 6 capital. 7 So the conditions are, No. 1 necessary 8 intent; No. 2, a determination at the end of the year 9 that, in fact, there were no earnings. 10 Conversely, if at the end of the year there 11 are profits, even though the first necessary condition, 12 intent, was satisfied, under 301 that would not be 13 enough; and the Government would treat it as income. 14 Isn't that the nub of your position? 15 MS. MAYNARD: If it were with respect to 16 stock and there were -17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. Yes. 18 MS. MAYNARD: -- earning profits, and it was 19 then income -20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I doubt that. Then -21 then, you would say, when it is not a criminal 22 prosecution for failure to pay taxes, so long as 23 somebody, when they take the money, intended it to be a 24 return of dividends, it does not become a return of 25 capital. Are you sure you're willing to live with that

1 intent requirement? 2 MS. MAYNARD: If at the time the corporation 3 made a distribution, Your Honor -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: At the time -- is it 5 important for the tax treatment that at the time of the 6 distribution it be intended to be either a return of 7 capital or dividends? Does that make the difference as 8 to whether you're going to be able to tax it or not? 9 MS. MAYNARD: It depends in all cases, in 10 both criminal and civil cases -- and in that sense the 11 Government doesn't agree with the Ninth Circuit's 12 reasoning -- in all cases whether or not something gets 13 the tax treatment set forth in 301(a) depends on whether 14 or not it's a distribution with respect to stock. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not -- we are not 16 talking about distribution. 17 MS. MAYNARD: Okay, I'm sorry. I 18 misunderstood your question. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: We are talking about the 20 intent that it be a return of capital or not. 21 MS. MAYNARD: If it -- - if the 22 Government -- if it was intended at the time it was paid 23 out to either be a dividend or return of capital or a 24 capital gain -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Either one.
28

1 MS. MAYNARD: -- that would be enough to 2 satisfy the -- with respect to stock -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: It could be anything at 4 all. So in other words, there is no preliminary 5 requirement that you intend that it be a return of 6 capital. Right. So if the Court of Appeals said that 7 here, it was wrong. 8 MS. MAYNARD: I think if the court chooses 9 to read their test that rigidly, I don't believe that 10 the Petitioner understood it that way. 11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well I -- let me -- I just 12 want to get clear on how you understand it. I gave you 13 one alternative in which you defend the Ninth Circuit. 14 Justice Scalia has given you another alternative in 15 which you don't defend the Ninth Circuit. Which -16 which are you going to take? 17 MS. MAYNARD: I must not understand. There 18 are three elements. I want to make clear there is an 19 additional element, Your Honor, to the defense than the 20 two you laid out. 21 That there would also -- the taxpayer must 22 have a sufficient basis in his stock to cover the amount 23 of the diverted funds for it to be treated as a return 24 of capital. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I try a third example?
29

1 Because I think an example might help. 2 Let us imagine that the company distributes 3 $10,000 on June 1 to every shareholder. 4 Let us imagine that every shareholder has a 5 basis of a trillion dollars in his stock. There is no 6 problem about basis. There is no problem about the 7 nature of the distribution. 8 Let us imagine they put in the corporate 9 records on June 1: This is a very valuable corporation; 10 we are going to make a fortune; and this is a dividend. 11 They write it down. 12 Now, unfortunately, four weeks later the 13 bottom falls out of the market, and it is not a dividend 14 for the reason that they have no profits that year. 15 Now, is it not under ordinary tax law a return of 16 capital? 17 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 19 MS. MAYNARD: If -20 JUSTICE BREYER: If that -- once you say 21 yes, then the Ninth Circuit must be wrong because the 22 Ninth Circuit said we do not look to see what happens. 23 MS. MAYNARD: If that's how -24 JUSTICE BREYER: A month later, we look just 25 to see how it's characterized by the corporation at the

1 moment of the transfer. 2 MS. MAYNARD: If one reads the Ninth 3 Circuit's test that rigidly -4 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's what they 5 said. 6 MS. MAYNARD: -- perhaps that would be 7 right. But I believe if one looks back to Miller, you 8 can see that the Ninth Circuit is talking about whether 9 or not it was a constructive distribution. 10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but why talk about 11 that at all? I mean, on Justice Breyer's third and 12 simplest example, he is basically saying let Section 301 13 make the determination, in effect, at the end of the 14 year, when we know what the actual situation of the 15 corporation is. If you wait and see, 301 takes care of 16 it, and you don't have to get into the -- sort of the 17 metaphysics of intent. 18 MS. MAYNARD: Well, there is a threshold 19 requirement to 301 treatment, Your Honor. 20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. Distribution with -21 distribution with respect to stock. 22 MS. MAYNARD: Right. And there -23 JUSTICE SOUTER: And I think he was assuming 24 and I'm assuming that -- that that condition is met. 25 But, in order to meet that condition, you don't have to

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 have a specific intent that the -- on the part of the 2 corporation that the distribution either be a return of 3 capital or that the distribution either be a dividend. 4 It simply has to be a distribution to this guy because 5 he is a stockholder. 6 MS. MAYNARD: That's right, Your Honor. We 7 agree with that. 8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 9 MS. MAYNARD: If he had testified here that 10 he believed he was receiving a dividend at the time he 11 took these funds, we believe that would be sufficient to 12 meet the threshold requirement. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: He wants a chance to argue 14 that. He was not given a chance to argue that. 15 MS. MAYNARD: I believe you can tell from 16 his proffer, Your Honor, that he understood his test was 17 to show that these were intended to be some sort of 18 constructive distributions. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there anything in the 20 tax court at all that used the words as having any 21 significance for this determination whether there was a 22 tax evasion here with respect to this stock?

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the tax court 2 originally. Was this a -- this was in the tax court? 3 MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a criminal case. 5 MS. MAYNARD: A criminal case, yes. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Okay. In the trial court 7 first. 8 MS. MAYNARD: In -- in -- the rule has been 9 clear in the Ninth Circuit since 1976 that you had to 10 make a showing that there was an intent at the time the 11 moneys were paid to make a constructive distribution. 12 So, no, there was no need to go back to 13 first principles and argue where in the statute that 14 rule was grounded; but the Government has made this 15 argument and made it in seeking an en banc prehearing in 16 D'Agostino, in 1998. 17 This is not a new argument. When -- when 18 the issue was reopened and they sought en banc review, 19 the Government -20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I can ask you sort of 21 an elementary, stupid question? What is the 22 Government's theory as to what this money was? Is it 23 the theory that it was a dividend or that it was salary? 24 MS. MAYNARD: The Government's theory of the 25 case, Your Honor -- but I'd like to step back and
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 explain it after I tell you what it was. The 2 Government's theory of the case was that this money was 3 stolen from the corporation. But in a criminal case, in 4 order to show tax a deficiency for purposes of tax 5 evasion or -6 JUSTICE STEVENS: So your theory, just to be 7 sure I understand, it was not salary; it was not a 8 dividend; it was the proceeds of an embezzlement? 9 MS. MAYNARD: That was as we argued it to 10 the jury, Your Honor. But there is no need in -- for 11 the Government to characterize in a tax -- for the 12 purposes of a criminal case, this Court's decision in 13 Holland makes clear that in order to prove the tax 14 deficiency element of a tax evasion case, or here a 15 false statement with respect to income for the false 16 return counts, the Government need prove only two 17 things: 18 One, that the Defendant received a 19 substantial amount of funds that he did not report on 20 his income taxes. 21 And, two, that the funds came from a likely 22 source of taxable income. 23 JUSTICE STEVENS: It does not have to prove 24 that it was income. 25 MS. MAYNARD: It has to prove that it came
34

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 from a likely source of taxable income. I mean, to 2 prove that here, Your Honor -3 JUSTICE STEVENS: I just want to be sure I 4 have the right answer. You do not have to prove that it 5 was income? 6 MS. MAYNARD: That is a proof -- that it's 7 income. We don't have to label what type of income it 8 is. 9 JUSTICE SOUTER: It's income to him. You 10 would be taking a different position if you thought you 11 could attribute it to the corporation and tax the 12 corporation, too. 13 MS. MAYNARD: The fact that it's -- it's 14 income to him. It may or may not be income to the 15 corporation. We also believe that it was income to the 16 corporation. 17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And if you want to 18 go after the corporation, you are specifically going to 19 take the position in this guy's case that, in fact, it 20 was income to the corporation. If there is no income to 21 the corporation, then you don't care, and that's the 22 situation you're in here. 23 MS. MAYNARD: It was income to the 24 corporation, Your Honor, even here. 25 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it was not profits; it
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 was not taxable income. 2 MS. MAYNARD: Yes. It should have been 3 income to the corporation, and -4 JUSTICE SOUTER: It was not taxable income. 5 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, it should have been. 6 Yes, Your Honor, it should have been taxable income to 7 the corporation, income that was coming to the 8 corporation that he diverted before it hit the corporate 9 -- just before it hit the corporation's books. In other 10 instances, he took money from the corporation and put it 11 to his personal use. 12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under your response to 13 Justice Stevens, once you show that it was from a likely 14 source of income that he received it, it's unreported, 15 then it's the defendant's burden to go ahead and show 16 this was a 301 distribution, that I had a basis that 17 absorbed it, that there were no earnings and profits. 18 That's all for the defendant. 19 MS. MAYNARD: The Government retains the 20 ultimate burden of proof at all times, Your Honor. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the court 22 didn't let the taxpayer submit evidence. He came 23 forward and said: Look, there's an issue here despite 24 the return of capital. I would have thought at that 25 point the burden shifted to you again. That burden --
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 having met that burden of production or at least tried 2 to, the burden would shift to you to show, no, it's not 3 a return of capital, it's a dividend. 4 MS. MAYNARD: Here he -- in order to make 5 the -- to make out a case, to be allowed to present a 6 defense to the jury, Your Honor, that the funds are 7 nontaxable, the defense must have some basis in fact. 8 And here he proffered nothing to show that this was a 9 dividend or a return of capital at the time it was made. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He said in his 11 proffer that he would present expert testimony that this 12 -- the corporation didn't have profits and earnings, and 13 therefore it was a return of capital. And the district 14 court said no, you don't get to do that. 15 MS. MAYNARD: It is -- I think this is, in 16 his proffer, the relevant portion of it, is in the JA on 17 page 97. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 19 MS. MAYNARD: And it says: "Alternatively, 20 the expert will explain that if the moneys were not 21 loans or advances or if Boulware did not use the moneys 22 for corporate purposes, then as the controlling 23 shareholder, the moneys could be deemed a constructive 24 return" -- "a constructive dividend or return of capital 25 to Boulware, which may or may not be income, depending
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 on whether or not HIE" -- the corporation -- "had 2 earnings and profits for the years when the moneys were 3 obtained by Boulware." 4 That's all he proffered, an expert who would 5 testify that it could have been either dividends, 6 Justice Breyer, or a return of capital. So he did 7 realize that he needed to show -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I mean, the 9 district court -- the district court said that's not 10 relevant, it's not relevant whether they could be 11 classified as dividends. I'm quoting from your brief on 12 page 8: "It is not relevant whether the funds could 13 have been classified as a return of capital or a 14 dividend at the time when they were diverted," because, 15 he said, what was relevant is -- is the intent, whether 16 they were in fact treated as return of capital. 17 MS. MAYNARD: That's right, Your Honor, and 18 our position is that in both civil and criminal cases 19 before something can be treated under the tax treatment 20 in 301(c), it must meet 301(a), which requires that, 21 under all the facts and circumstances it in fact be a 22 distribution, either a dividend or return of capital. 23 And all his proffer testifies -- all his proffer offered 24 is that it theoretically could be deemed a dividend or 25 theoretically could be deemed a return of capital.
38
Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: I think maybe he was simply 2 getting at the fact that under 301, assuming the 3 possibilities of non-301 treatment are excluded, under 4 301 it will be treated either as a dividend or as a 5 return of capital, depending on the corporate books for 6 that year, and he wasn't making a proffer at that point 7 precisely as to what those corporate books would show, 8 but he was making a proffer that, under 301, it would 9 either be classified as a dividend or as a return of 10 capital. And wasn't that enough to -- to get him -- get 11 him the right to introduce the evidence? 12 MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. In our view, 13 301(a), the language with respect to stock, and the 14 regulations have so interpreted it and the legislative 15 history makes clear that it was added to the 1954 Code 16 specifically to show that, before distributions can 17 receive that treatment. Regardless of what the facts 18 are about E and P and regardless of what the facts are 19 about the basis, it had to have been a corporate 20 distribution with respect to stock. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if he is 22 making a profit and it depends upon whether or not 23 there's adequate earnings or not, isn't he plainly 24 saying that that means it's with respect to my stock? 25 Because if he were getting it, for example, as an

1 employee for consideration, it wouldn't matter whether 2 there was sufficient earnings or not. But when he says 3 it depends on whether there's sufficient earnings, it 4 seems to me that that's clearly notifying you that he's 5 saying it's with respect to his stock. 6 MS. MAYNARD: This proffer also has factual 7 proffers in it, Your Honor, and none of the factual 8 proffers go to the fact that it was with respect to 9 stock. The Petitioner testified -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: He said -- and it seems to 11 me that this is enough to put you on notice -- "Boulware 12 will present further evidence that all of the alleged 13 unreported income was either a loan or advance or was 14 used by Boulware for corporate purposes or for the 15 benefit of HIE." 16 MS. MAYNARD: He -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, "for corporate 18 purposes" would include either a return of capital or a 19 dividend, payment out to shareholders. 20 MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. No, Your 21 Honor, it wouldn't. For corporate purposes -- and he 22 testified here, and he testified as to those three 23 things. He testified that he thought the moneys were 24 always corporate moneys. In other words, that he'd been 25 given them to use them to buy coffee and do other things
40

1 that were for the corporation. He testified that, 2 alternatively, he thought they were loans to him and 3 that he was going to pay them. And alternatively he 4 thought that they were corporate advances to him. The 5 jury was instructed on all those things and rejected 6 them in convicting him. 7 But he did not testify that he thought he 8 was being paid a dividend. He did not testify that he 9 thought he was being paid a return of capital. And the 10 reason he proffered an expert is because he doesn't 11 believe there is this first element of the defense, at 12 bottom, that the Government believes that there is, and 13 that in 301(a) the threshold requirement, with respect 14 to stock -- and if you trace back the civil cases, and 15 the basis in the D'Agostino rule is based on civil cases 16 interpreting the old code -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Tell me about the civil 18 case? There would be a tax deficiency, and wouldn't the 19 Government have to say what were the elements of the tax 20 deficiency? 21 You said in a criminal case they don't have 22 to characterize it at all. You just say he got -- he 23 has money on which tax hasn't been paid, and there was a 24 likely source of income. But now you're in a deficiency 25 mode, and the Government asserts a deficiency. Doesn't
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 it have to say what the elements of the deficiency are? 2 And what would it say in this case? 3 MS. MAYNARD: Well, in this case the 4 Government's position at bottom is that he stole these 5 funds, but that -- but in the criminal case it didn't 6 need to characterize it. 7 I think -- and if I can take a common 8 criminal -- a common civil situation, Your Honor, where 9 a corporation comes in and tries to deduct a salary that 10 it pays to a controlling shareholder and/or to, say, the 11 spouse of the controlling shareholder who is also a 12 shareholder, and the services that that person has 13 provided, the corporation has called it a salary and 14 deducted it as necessary business expenses, and the 15 Service comes in and says that's -- we're going to 16 disallow that deduction and then that's litigated in Tax 17 Court. 18 In that situation, the Government does often 19 argue that that -- the excess -- you know, say this 20 person at home is providing $10,000 in bookkeeping 21 services to the corporation, when in fact a net value, a 22 net worth, fair market value of $10,000 of services, but 23 being paid $500,000, and the corporation is deducting it 24 as a necessary business expense of $500,000. The issue 25 in that case will turn on whether or not there was an
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 intent to compense for services, whether or not the 2 services are reasonable, and the Government may well 3 come in and say -4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take this 5 case. Let's take this case and not some hypothetical, 6 and where -- on the civil side -- the Government is 7 asserting a deficiency. Just change one thing. The 8 corporation is rich with earnings and profits. What 9 would the notice of deficiency say? 10 MS. MAYNARD: You know, I -- to be honest 11 with you, Your Honor, I don't know, but the -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't the Government 13 want to take the position that this is a dividend and 14 not something else, if that were the case? 15 MS. MAYNARD: The Government -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If there were earnings 17 and profits. 18 MS. MAYNARD: The Government might want to 19 take that position, Your Honor. On the facts of this 20 case, the Government's position is that he stole these 21 funds. But in a hypothetical situation like this case, 22 if the Government wanted to take a position, it is our 23 view here and certainly if you adopt the rule that we're 24 arguing for, that 301(a) -- that there must be -- the 25 facts and circumstances must suggest that the moneys

1 were taken out with respect to the stock because of the 2 person's status as a shareholder. 3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Maynard, may I just go 4 back to your hypothetical for a second? In the closely 5 held corporation situation you describe where they pay a 6 huge salary to the wife of the president and they decide 7 you can't deduct that, that's really a dividend -8 that's what the Government normally does in that 9 situation. And don't they decide it's a dividend 10 irrespective of the intent of the company making the 11 distribution? 12 MS. MAYNARD: Well, in that situation -13 JUSTICE STEVENS: So there's no attempt on 14 the part of them to satisfy with "respect to stock" 15 requirement? 16 MS. MAYNARD: Well, the express intent, Your 17 Honor, is belied by all the facts and circumstances. I 18 mean, just to be clear, the Government is arguing for an 19 objective test here -- JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the 20 only fact and circumstance in your hypothetical is they 21 paid them a million dollars when they only earned 22 $100,000? 23 MS.

In what way did this 8 person get the payment, and why did they get the 9 payment? Why did the corporation make a payment to this 10 person? 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely he is entitled to 12 try to prove that. And I'm still hung up on your 13 assertion that he made no proffer on it below. 14 Here's another portion of the joint 15 appendix. The expert, his expert, he says, will further 16 explain that if Boulware used -- this is on page 97, 17 bottom of 97: "If Boulware used the moneys for 18 corporate purposes, the moneys were not income to 19 Boulware. Alternatively, the expert will explain that 20 if the moneys were not loans or advances or if Boulware 21 did not use the moneys for corporate purposes, then as 22 the controlling shareholder, the moneys could be deemed 23 a constructive dividend or a return of capital to 24 Boulware, which may or may not be income depending on 25 whether or not HIE had earnings."

He already knows that. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me get something 19 clear. They wish to introduce evidence. They wish to 20 introduce evidence. And you say, oh, well, the proffer 21 is no good because there is no basis, so there was no 22 evidence. I don't understand that. 23 MS. MAYNARD: They wish to introduce expert 24 evidence that it could be deemed, as a legal matter -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, I see.

1 MS. MAYNARD: They don't have -2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you say there was no 3 other evidence in the record that the expert could use 4 for that testimony? 5 MS. MAYNARD: Exactly, Your Honor. In fact, 6 the Ninth Circuit decision, on Pet. App. 6, makes that 7 clear. Boulware presented no concrete proof that the 8 amounts were considered, intended. Or recorded on the 9 corporate records as a return on capital. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not right. 11 He says right here that it may or may not be income 12 depending on a fact, not an expert's opinion, whether or 13 not HIE had earnings and profits for the years when the 14 moneys were obtained by Boulware. That's a question of 15 fact. You look at the corporate books. You get the 16 accountant on to testify. It's not an expert's view on 17 what's legally relevant. 18 MS. MAYNARD: But that fact goes to the 19 second element. And what we're disputing is sufficiency 20 on the first element, which is that it must have been a 21 corporate distribution with respect to the 22 corporation's -23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not totally 24 relevant if the question he is trying to submit, whether 25 they are earnings or profits or not, which will affect

1 its treatment. It's only relevant if it's with respect 2 to stock. 3 MS. MAYNARD: Right, Your Honor. And he 4 presented absolutely no factual basis -5 JUSTICE BREYER: But we don't -- we are not 6 certain on that one, I think, because of the cases he 7 said before would this be a possible holding. If it was 8 a distribution in respect to the stock, and if he had 9 sufficient basis, then if there were no earnings and 10 profits in the corporation during the year, it would be 11 treated as a tax deficiency -- no tax deficiency or it 12 would be a return of capital. Insofar as as the Ninth 13 Circuit says something to the contrary, it is wrong. 14 Now, if we remand to decide whether the -15 whether he intended to prove and produced enough to show 16 they didn't have the earnings and profits and also to 17 consider the question of whether this was a distribution 18 in respect to stock. 19 MS. MAYNARD: If you were -- if you are 20 going to remand, Your Honor -21 JUSTICE BREYER: Does the Government have 22 any objection to what I just said? 23 MS. MAYNARD: Well, if you're going to 24 remand, Your Honor, all three elements should be opened. 25 The Government's view is that he knew that he needed --
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that the Ninth Circuit's rule required him to proffer on 2 the first element, that, in other words, that it was 3 intended to be a constructive corporate distribution by 4 somebody, that is any evidence -- this is not a high 5 burden. He could have testified he thought it was a 6 constructive distribution intent. Either he could have 7 testified it was a dividend, or he could have testified 8 he thought it was a return of capital. 9 Mr. Monago also testified, Your Honor, that 10 it was not -- there were no dividends during the 11 relevant period. So there is testimony in the 12 Government's case that there were no dividends in the 13 relevant period and no returns of capital during the 14 relevant period. And he proffered no basis in fact to 15 believe that what happened here nor did any of the facts 16 that suggest what happened here, unlike in our excessive 17 salary case, Your Honor, where the government books it 18 as a deductible business expense, and one can infer from 19 the fact that it's such an unreasonable salary that it 20 must have been earnings and profits. Here the facts of 21 record are that -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, please -23 MS. MAYNARD: There is no way to infer from 24 the way in which he diverted these funds that these 25 funds were with respect to stocks.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 2 Ms. Maynard. 3 Mr. Cline, you have four -- ten minutes 4 remaining. 5 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. CLINE 6 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 7 MR. CLINE: Your Honor, I just want to make 8 a few quick points. 9 The phrase "with respect to stock" was never 10 discussed in the district court at all. It was never 11 discussed before the court of appeals panel at all. It 12 was never the basis in the lower courts for the 13 Government's position that Mr. Boulware could not assert 14 a return of capital defense. 15 The Government's sole argument, from the 16 time it moved to exclude Mr. Boulware's testimony on 17 this issue and his evidence on this issue to the time 18 that it sought to prevent him from getting a jury 19 instruction on this issue, the Government's only 20 argument was Miller, and in particular the Miller 21 requirement that there be an intent, a contemporaneous 22 intent that the distribution be a return of capital. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even so, no harm no foul, 25 if, in fact, you hadn't proffered any evidence that
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 would enable you to meet the -- in respect to stock 2 requirement. Now, what do you say to the contention 3 that you hadn't proffered anything? 4 MR. CLINE: I say several things, Justice 5 Scalia. First of all, I think there was an adequate 6 proffer at page 97 of the joint appendix. 7 Second, at pages 62 through 66 of the joint 8 appendix, Mr. Boulware specifically invokes Truesdell 9 and the -- and the D'Agostino no earnings, no profits -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, at 97, are you 11 saying that the expert would have brought with him 12 financial records to show earnings and profits and 13 basis? Because I interpret the Government as saying 14 there was nothing for him to testify to because there 15 was no other -- the basic value was not in the record. 16 MR. CLINE: Justice Kennedy, there actually 17 is a fair amount of basis data in the record. And I can 18 quickly refer the Court to the portions of the joint 19 appendix. There is testimony, for example, that 20 Mr. Boulware contributed a water company value of 21 roughly $1.7 million dollars to HIE. That's at joint 22 appendix 70 through 73, 116 through 23, 147 through 51. 23 There's evidence that he contributed a 24 coffee processing and wholesaling business valued at 25 roughly $1.8 million. That's at joint appendix 123
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 through 27, 151 through 53. 2 There was evidence that he spent money on 3 coffee beans for -4 JUSTICE BREYER: But those are different. 5 Those are whether that's a corporate purpose. I think 6 the question here is, as I started, I thought that this 7 expert was going to testify that there were no earnings 8 and profits in the relevant year. Having read it more 9 closely, it seems to me that that is not what the expert 10 is going to testify. Rather, he's going to say if there 11 were no earnings and profits, then it is a return of 12 capital if the basis is high enough. He's going to 13 testify to that legal proposition. 14 So, my question is, is there any proffer of 15 evidence here where the taxpayer says I want a chance to 16 show there were no earnings or profits? 17 MR. CLINE: Justice Breyer -18 JUSTICE BREYER: Where is it? 19 MR. CLINE: That's how I read the portion of 20 the joint appendix at pages 62 through 66 that I 21 referred to where Mr. Boulware invokes that rule. 22 Now, the problem here was that at no 23 point -- from the very beginning, the Government brought 24 this issue to fore by filing a motion in limine. And 25 the sole focus of the Government's motion in limine was
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the Miller contemporaneous intent rule, and that was the 2 sole focus of the discussion. That's all anyone talked 3 about in the district court. 4 And so, Justice Breyer, the proffer is not 5 as wholesome as I might hope, but it's clear that 6 Mr. Boulware sought the opportunity to present earnings 7 and profits and basic information through expert 8 testimony. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you recognize that he 10 would have the burden? If he said this corporation had 11 no earnings and profits so what I got was a return of 12 capital, it would be his burden to show that? 13 MR. CLINE: I think, Justice Ginsburg, that 14 under the rule in Bok and under the rule that the 15 parties proceeded under in the district court in this 16 case, whether or not it's the correct rule, Mr. Boulware 17 had the burden of producing some evidence, some evidence 18 of the earnings and profits and the basis issues. Then 19 the burden of persuasion -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Coming forward, he had 21 the burden of coming forward? 22 MR. CLINE: Just the burden of coming 23 forward with some evidence, even if it's weak evidence 24 or not credible evidence, just to put the issue in play. 25 Then the burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 rests with the Government. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that 3 evidence? If he has the burden of coming forward with 4 it, I assume that means in the proffer. And where is 5 it? 6 MR. CLINE: The evidence, Your Honor, is in 7 the record where I have previously identified. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Breyer's 9 point is that that isn't directed to that issue. It's 10 directed to the issue of whether he was using the funds 11 for a corporate purpose. 12 MR. CLINE: Actually, Your Honor, it was -13 it was -- the evidence that came into the record came 14 into the record more or less by happenstance because the 15 district court had prohibited any evidence of return of 16 capital. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that evidence 18 came in after the proffer, didn't it? 19 MR. CLINE: No. It came in throughout the 20 trial. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, this is a 22 motion in limine which is before the trial. 23 MR. CLINE: No. The motion was actually 24 filed June 30th, which is, I think, the third day of 25 trial. The issue was litigated continuously throughout
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the trial up until, I think, July 11th, which was a day 2 or two before it ended. This issue came up repeatedly 3 throughout the trial. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: So what did happen there? 5 I've been looking at page 62 through 66. They are 6 dancing around the issue. It's fair to say that they 7 wouldn't be having these four pages unless they are 8 thinking of return of capital as a defense, but they 9 don't actually say it. 10 MR. CLINE: Justice Breyer, had the issue 11 not been limited to the Miller -12 JUSTICE BREYER: They would have raised it. 13 MR. CLINE: I believe that Mr. Boulware 14 would have presented expert testimony that would, in 15 fact, have at least put into play the issue of earnings 16 and profits and basis. 17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well am I -- am I right 18 that all he would have to do in order to satisfy that 19 burden would be this: He would have the option, which I 20 gather he availed himself of, to show that, in fact, the 21 -- the funds were loans or non-income to him. 22 And he would also have had the option to 23 follow that by putting on the corporate accountant 24 saying: This guy is a stockholder. It's what the 25 corporate books show. In fact, that's not in dispute.

1 No. 2, the corporation didn't have any 2 profits that year. No. 3, if the money was diverted, if 3 the money was corporate funds, the only thing left under 4 301 is to treat it as a return of capital. And if, in 5 fact, the funds exceeded his basis, to treat it as a 6 capital gain. 7 So all he had to do, in effect, to make the 8 proffer, as I understand it, is to say: If you don't 9 believe me that this was non-income like a loan, then 10 all I have to do is to put in the evidence that the 11 corporation didn't have any -- any profits that year, 12 and Section 301 will take care of the rest of it. 13 Because you have to conclude that it's either a return 14 of capital or a capital gain. 15 Is that fair? Is that correct? 16 MR. CLINE: I think that's basically right, 17 Justice Souter, and -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. Doesn't he 19 have to show, still show, that it's with respect to 20 stock? 21 MR. CLINE: Yes, but -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: That one little element: 23 That he has to show the distribution was not because 24 this was his girlfriend, but it was with respect to 25 stock, and the record is -- is that the intent?
56

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: But doesn't -- doesn't he 2 suffice, on a going forward burden, simply to show that 3 he is a stockholder? 4 MR. CLINE: I think so, Justice Souter, and 5 I think -6 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean I agree with Justice 7 Scalia, but doesn't he make it at least to the point of 8 putting the Government to its proof by showing that he 9 is a stockholder? 10 MR. CLINE: That he is a stockholder, and 11 that he did not receive this money in any nonstockholder 12 capacity. 13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 14 MR. CLINE: For example, for income or 15 something like that. And I think the record is probably 16 adequate as it stands. Now, he was clearly a 17 stockholder. He would not have received this money had 18 he not been a stockholder. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's kind of 20 hard to say it's with respect to stock when the other 21 stockholder doesn't get any. 22 MR. CLINE: Chief Justice Roberts, the 23 cases, again, are uniform -- and we cite them, I think, 24 at footnote 8 of our reply brief -- that you can have a 25 constructive distribution even if there are no corporate
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 formalities, even if it's a disproportionate 2 distribution, even if other stockholders don't share it. 3 And, again, that's a position that the Government 4 argues. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What page in your 6 brief did you say? 7 MR. CLINE: I believe it is -- the cases are 8 cited, I believe, at footnote 8 of our reply brief. Let 9 me just make sure. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of your reply brief? 11 MR. CLINE: It's footnote 3 -- I'm sorry. 12 It's footnote 3 on page 8, and there is a whole series 13 of cases. And, again, as far as I know, Mr. Chief 14 Justice, there is no law to the contrary, and this is a 15 position that the Government, itself, argues. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: The issue is whether the 17 Government wants to convict more -- more malfeasors or 18 whether it wants to collect more money, and the latter 19 obviously prevails in the cases, right? 20 MR. CLINE: But, Justice Scalia, it seems to 21 prevail only in this case, and I would be astonished if 22 counsel argues that the Government views Mr. Boulware as 23 having stolen this money from the corporation. I would 24 be astonished if the Government would accept a theft 25 deduction, if HIE argued for it, when the Government
