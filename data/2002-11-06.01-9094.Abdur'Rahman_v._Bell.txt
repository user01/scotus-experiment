 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 next in Number 01-9094, Abu-Ali Abdur' Rahman versus Ricky
 5 Bell.
 6 Mr. Liebman. I think the Court would like to
 7 hear argument on the questions we asked for supplemental
 8 briefing on, as well as your original petition.
 9 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. LIEBMAN
 10 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 11 MR. LIEBMAN: Okay. Mr. Chief Justice, and may
 12 it please the Court:
 13 The question I'd like to take up first is why,
 14 in our view, the unusual circumstances of this case
 15 satisfy the two sets of demanding requirements that are on 16 the petitioner here to succeed: 1) he has to show that
 17 this is not a successive petition, and 2) he then
 18 additionally has to get over the high hurdle that 60(b)
 19 imposes.
 20 Let me, though, go first to the jurisdictional
 21 questions that Your Honor referred to. This case was in
 22 the court of appeals in three ways. It was there because
 23 Mr. -- the petitioner here went into the district court
 24 and he said, here's my 60(b) motion, I'd like to get 60(b)
 25 relief.

3

1 The district court -- and this is on pages 42
 2 through 44 of the record, of the joint appendix -- said
 3 very, very clearly that it was going to make two rulings. 
 4 First it said, this is not a Rule 60(b) motion, it is
 5 something else, it's a successive petition. Because it's
 6 a successive petition, you cannot get 60(b) relief in this
 7 court, and I'm going to refer or --
 8 QUESTION: That's the district court judge?
 9 MR. LIEBMAN: Right. What I -- but what that
 10 did, Your Honor, was to establish a final disposition. It
 11 terminated all of the petitioner's rights under 60(b). 
 12 There were no rights left. He told the district court --
 13 QUESTION: Couldn't he have moved to -- in the
 14 Sixth Circuit -- to remand the case if he disagreed with
 15 that?
 16 MR. LIEBMAN: He did. He did, Your Honor.
 17 QUESTION: Well, but that means that the
 18 district court's decision was not final.
 19 MR. LIEBMAN: Well, it was final for purposes of
 20 the 60(b), because the -- for purposes of the district
 21 court's view there could be, would be, never could be any
 22 60(b) relief.
 23 QUESTION: But it wasn't a final judgment in the
 24 sense that an appeal could be sought from that, because it
 25 was transferred. The district court judge transferred it. 

4

1 He didn't dismiss the 60(b) motion, which I would have
 2 thought the district court might have done, and then it
 3 perhaps could have been appealable.
 4 MR. LIEBMAN: Well, Your Honor, all of that's
 5 right, and if the belts don't work, let's go to the
 6 suspenders. He -- the case was transferred to the court
 7 of appeals. The court of appeals, however, could not take
 8 jurisdiction over the case unless the prerequisite for its
 9 jurisdiction was established, and if you look at
 10 2244(b)(3), which is in our appendix to our brief at
 11 page 1a --
 12 QUESTION: Page 1a of the blue brief?
 13 MR. LIEBMAN: 1a of the blue brief, it's very
 14 clear under (b)(3)(A) that it has to be a second or
 15 successive application before the court of appeals has any 16 jurisdiction to do anything with it, so its jurisdiction
 17 turns on the question whether it was a successive petition
 18 or not. If it wasn't one, it could not act under this
 19 statute and would have to remand back to the district
 20 court. That's exactly what happened in the Martinez-
 21 Villareal case.
 22 QUESTION: Well, what -- what does the statute,
 23 the AEDPA statute contemplate? That somebody in this
 24 defendant's position could have applied to the court of
 25 appeals for permission to file a successive petition? 

5

1 Could that have been done here?
 2 MR. LIEBMAN: Yes.
 3 QUESTION: That was not done?
 4 MR. LIEBMAN: It was not done here because he
 5 was saying all along this was not a successive petition,
 6 if it was, he would not satisfy it. He --
 7 QUESTION: Go ahead.
 8 MR. LIEBMAN: He was saying that he did satisfy
 9 the requirements of 60(b), that the statute recognizes a
 10 difference between certain --
 11 QUESTION: Well, then, to get an appeal on
 12 that -- it sounds so complicated, because the law has
 13 gotten so complicated with AEDPA, but maybe he should have
 14 sought transfer back to the district court so the district
 15 court could dismiss it and give something from which an 16 appeal could be taken.
 17 MR. LIEBMAN: Oh but, Your Honor, in Martinez-
 18 Villareal, I think it's very clear this case is exactly
 19 the same as Martinez-Villareal, which this Court ruled
 20 expressly on the -- the first question it took up was the
 21 jurisdictional question. What happened there is that the
 22 petitioner went to the district court, the district court
 23 said, this is a successive petition, I'm transferring, you
 24 can't be in this court.
 25 He then took an appeal, and he went up on a

6

1 transfer saying, okay, you've got the transferred motion
 2 in front of you.
 3 The court of appeals actually dismissed the
 4 appeal saying, we don't have that, but it decided in the
 5 context of the transfer -- and this is very standard
 6 procedure here now under AEDPA -- it decided, first
 7 question first, do we have jurisdiction, and it said, you
 8 know what, we figured out that we don't have jurisdiction
 9 because this is not a successive petition, so we remand
 10 back to the district court.
 11 This Court then took cert on that question, and
 12 the first question it asked was, do we have cert here
 13 because of subsection (e) here, and it said, we do have
 14 cert here because (e) is very clear. The grant or denial
 15 of authorization can't come to the Court.
 16 QUESTION: Well, let's go back to (3)(A) for a
 17 minute, Mr. Liebman. It says -- as you point out --
 18 before a second or successive application permitted by
 19 this section is filed in the district court. You say all
 20 of that is a prerequisite, I take it, for the court of
 21 appeals acting, but supposing it's a second or successive
 22 application that is not permitted by this section. That
 23 wouldn't deprive the court of appeals of the jurisdiction
 24 to say no, would it?
 25 MR. LIEBMAN: Absolutely. In fact, it has the

7

1 obligation, not just the jurisdiction, to decide whether
 2 it is a successive petition, because if it isn't, it can't
 3 decide the case, because then it's got to start with the
 4 district --
 5 QUESTION: Well, but -- so then the first,
 6 the -- the first clause of (3)(A) is not really, strictly
 7 speaking, entirely jurisdictional.
 8 MR. LIEBMAN: Oh, well I -- I'm not actually
 9 sure it's the first clause. It says that the applicant
 10 shall move in the appropriate court for an order
 11 authorizing that. That's what essentially gives the court
 12 the jurisdiction, but it's got to be for an order
 13 authorizing what qualifies under the statute as a second
 14 and successive application. This was not a second and
 15 successive application. 
 Therefore, as in Martinez16 Villareal --
 17 QUESTION: Well, that's, of course, part of the
 18 issue in the case.
 19 MR. LIEBMAN: Right, but that -- his position
 20 was it was not, and therefore the court needed to dismiss
 21 that case, and it had two options at that point. It could
 22 either remand it back, which is the majority approach, or
 23 it could simply have dismissed, and then he could have
 24 gone back and filed in the district court again, which is
 25 what a few courts do.

8

1 QUESTION: Mr. Liebman, initially in this case,
 2 when the district judge transferred -- I think it got one
 3 on the State's recommendation that that's how you handle
 4 these cases. On behalf of the defendant, did anyone ever
 5 say, please enter judgment against me under 60(b), I want
 6 to make this -- test whether this is a 60(b) case or a
 7 habeas case?
 8 MR. LIEBMAN: That did not happen, Your Honor,
 9 although petitioner understood the court's decision, if
 10 you look on pages 41 and 42, to say this -- it expressly
 11 says, you cannot file 60(b) here in this court because
 12 it's automatically successive. You cannot do it. You
 13 will never get any rights under 60(b).
 14 QUESTION: But he could have asked to test that. 
 15 He could have said, please don't transfer.
 16 MR. LIEBMAN: He could have, but in -- Your
 17 Honor, in the Martinez-Villareal case, there was no such
 18 question, no -- no --
 19 QUESTION: -- see what Martinez-Real has to do
 20 with it. I may be missing it, but I thought that in -- in
 21 this case, the reason that you cannot appeal from the
 22 court of appeals order refusing to give you permission to
 23 file a second habeas is because there's a statute that
 24 says you can't come to this court when a court of appeals
 25 refuses to give permission on second habeas, and none of

9

1 that was involved, to my knowledge, in Martinez-Real.
 2 MR. LIEBMAN: Oh, yes --
 3 QUESTION: That was a question about whether or
 4 not there was a premature decision, or whatever it was,
 5 and they sent -- the court of appeals sent it back for
 6 adjudication on this issue.
 7 MR. LIEBMAN: No, Your Honor.
 8 QUESTION: No, it's -- I'm not right?
 9 MR. LIEBMAN: The provision (e) here says that
 10 the grant or denial of an authorization cannot come up to
 11 the Court on cert, so the fact that the court there in --
 12 QUESTION: You mean, Martinez-Real was a grant
 13 of a petition for second or successive?
 14 MR. LIEBMAN: No. It was --
 15 QUESTION: 
 Well, then, what has that statute to 16 do with it?
 17 MR. LIEBMAN: What it said was -- and this is
 18 what the Court said in Martinez-Villareal quite clearly. 
 19 There's a threshold question. The threshold question is,
 20 do we have in front of us a second or successive petition.
 21 QUESTION: In Martinez-Real?
 22 MR. LIEBMAN: Yes. Yes, yes, yes. That was the
 23 question there, because Martinez-Villareal filed a request
 24 to --
 25 QUESTION: And what did the court of appeals say

10

1 was the answer?
 2 MR. LIEBMAN: It said, the answer is, this is
 3 not a second or successive petition.
 4 QUESTION: Fine, so then the statute doesn't
 5 apply, I guess --
 6 MR. LIEBMAN: Oh -- but here the court said --
 7 if I can be clear about this -- the court said two things,
 8 and it said them actually in different orders. January 18
 9 order, it said, this is a successive petition, so now
 10 we've got to go to the gateway question of whether you can
 11 get into court. And then a couple of weeks later,
 12 actually almost a month later, February 11, it said, you
 13 don't meet the gateway requirement.
 14 QUESTION: I -- I just don't see how you get
 15 around the statute that says that you can't come here 16 after a court of appeals either grants or denies the
 17 second or successive.
 18 MR. LIEBMAN: Well, that's what I'm --
 19 QUESTION: Which wasn't at issue, I take it, in
 20 the other case.
 21 MR. LIEBMAN: That's what I'm trying to say. 
 22 The very first thing that our cert petition says in this
 23 case is, we are not asking for cert from the question of
 24 whether or not we meet the gateway requirement.
 25 QUESTION: Yes, but you -- one doesn't really

11

1 ask for cert from -- from a question. One asks for cert
 2 to review an order, and the order of the court of appeals
 3 is an order granting or denying.
 4 MR. LIEBMAN: This order had multiple parts,
 5 Your Honor. It was actually divided up into multiple
 6 parts, and what he said was, we are asking for cert from
 7 some parts of the order, segmented out and given
 8 paragraphs. We are not asking for cert from other parts
 9 of that decision.
 10 QUESTION: But I think the question is whether
 11 you can ask for cert for any -- from any -- part of it in
 12 view of the provision of the statute that it's not -- I
 13 just don't -- I'm not sure you can bifurcate the order and
 14 say, we're not challenging the denial, we're challenging,
 15 in effect, the reason for the denial.
 16 MR. LIEBMAN: Well, this was not a denial. What
 17 the statute says -- and I think that's really important --
 18 is the grant -- I'm reading (e), as we go over from (1)(A)
 19 to (2)(A). The grant or denial of an authorization by a
 20 court of appeals to file a second or successive
 21 application shall not be appealable, but he was not
 22 appealing the grant or denial. He was appealing the
 23 preliminary question whether it even was, whether the
 24 court even could have taken jurisdiction of that because
 25 it had a second or successive --

12

1 QUESTION: That's not a judgment. You -- you
 2 appeal judgments, you appeal orders, you appeal
 3 dispositions of the lower court. You -- you don't appeal
 4 statements or -- or expressions. You -- you appeal
 5 dispositions. The only disposition here was the denial of
 6 the -- of the application.
 7 MR. LIEBMAN: Well, Your Honor, then let me go
 8 to the garter if the belts and suspenders haven't worked
 9 here. Petitioner filed a motion in the court of appeals
 10 on his original appeal, and he said, in this appeal, what
 11 we would like you to do is, rather than issuing the
 12 mandate on the judgment that you issued before, which went
 13 up on cert, we would like you to remand this case in order
 14 for the court below to take up these issues, whether on
 15 60(b) or in other ways, and the court denied that motion. 16 It didn't say why, but it denied that motion
 17 without, expressly in regard to that, doing any kind of
 18 gatewaying. It just said, we deny it.
 19 Now, it gives the reason in the earlier January
 20 18 order that it thought that any post judgment motion in
 21 one of these cases was automatically successive, and
 22 that's our first question --
 23 QUESTION: All right, but --
 24 MR. LIEBMAN: -- which is, that was a mistake --
 25 QUESTION: -- on that -- now, this will get to

13

1 the merits, which I'm sure you'd like to get to --
 2 MR. LIEBMAN: Yes.
 3 QUESTION: -- but I thought that the argument
 4 that what the court of appeals did was right is roughly
 5 the following, that what your client should have done, or
 6 the way it should have worked is that the district court
 7 initially dismissed -- dismissed on the ground that there
 8 was a procedural default -- his initial parts of the
 9 initial petition, because, said the district court, he
 10 didn't exhaust those, and he can't do it now because the
 11 time is up, and your client never appealed that ruling
 12 in -- the first time.
 13 What he should have done is appealed it. Then,
 14 when he asked for cert and the Tennessee statement came
 15 down, he would simply have amended his cert petition and 16 allowed us to GVR in light of our case in Tennessee, but
 17 he couldn't do that, because he hadn't appealed that in
 18 the first place, and therefore he had a final ruling, a
 19 final judgment against him on that issue, and -- and
 20 that's why -- that's why what the court of appeals did was
 21 right, and that's also why it really is a second and
 22 successive, because after all, you -- it's -- you want a
 23 district judge to reopen a judgment where he made a
 24 mistake but you didn't appeal it.
 25 MR. LIEBMAN: Your Honor, you're absolutely

14

1 right, the premise, which is that Rule 60(b) or related
 2 motions in the court of appeals cannot be used to fill the
 3 office of an appeal, but there's a very established
 4 doctrine there. It came up in the Muniz case, in the
 5 Blackmon v. Money remand that this Court made, and the
 6 question there is whether it was reasonably available to
 7 him at that moment to make an appeal. If it was, 60(b)
 8 doesn't come into play, and that's perhaps the most
 9 important question in this case.
 10 As of the time Mr. Abdur' Rahman filed his
 11 brief, his first brief, opening brief in the Tennessee --
 12 I mean, in the Sixth Circuit on August 5, 1999, this
 13 Court's O'Sullivan decision had come down two months
 14 earlier. O'Sullivan read a rule of Illinois procedure
 15 establishing a discretionary review process that is 16 identical in terms. The State of Alabama has actually
 17 gone through the terms in its brief and shown that they're
 18 identical.
 19 This Court said, and I quote, without more,
 20 those words are not sufficient to tell us that that
 21 discretionary procedure is outside the ordinary post-
 22 conviction review process in that State. In this State of
 23 Tennessee at the time, there was that rule, identical to
 24 the rule in O'Sullivan, and nothing more in the law. In
 25 fact, the State concedes in its brief that there was

15

1 nothing in Tennessee law at the time besides the rule.
 2 So it was not available to him at that point for
 3 the very reason that if he had made that argument, it
 4 would have been a frivolous argument because it would have
 5 run foursquare into the precise holding of a decision of
 6 this Court but two months before. It was only when Rule
 7 39 came down after the appeal was over, while the case was
 8 on cert, that it said no, no, no, no, the law of Tennessee
 9 has been since 1967 that our discretionary review
 10 procedure in Rule 11 has never been part of the regular
 11 and routine State post-conviction review process that we
 12 have --
 13 QUESTION: Mr. Liebman, we've decided a couple
 14 of cases, one about 30 years ago, Harris against Nelson,
 15 and then another case called Pitchess, in maybe -- that 16 indicate that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and
 17 particularly 60(b), do not apply if they conflict at all
 18 with the habeas regulations. Now, you don't cite
 19 either -- either of those cases in your brief.
 20 MR. LIEBMAN: Yes, we do. We cite --
 21 QUESTION: I'm sorry. I --
 22 MR. LIEBMAN: We cite both of them on --
 23 QUESTION: I didn't see them in the index.
 24 MR. LIEBMAN: Well, I believe that they are
 25 cited in our -- well, I guess you're right. I thought we

16

1 had cited them in the reply brief, but we make reference
 2 to them where we point out, if I can find it here -- yes,
 3 we do, Your Honor. On page 3 of our reply brief, the
 4 yellow brief, we cite Pitchess and Browder.
 5 QUESTION: You didn't cite them in your opening
 6 brief.
 7 MR. LIEBMAN: We didn't. The State raised them,
 8 and we responded to them, and the point is that we
 9 actually think that Martinez-Villareal and Slack stand on
 10 top of Pitchess and Browder, so that they were obviously
 11 decided in that same context, and so we cited the more
 12 recent case, but in any event in our reply brief, what we
 13 point out is, this Court has been very clear to say, is
 14 there a conflict between a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
 15 and the habeas jurisprudence?
 16 If so, the civil rule doesn't apply. If not, it
 17 does apply, and as almost all of the courts of appeals
 18 have held, there are certain very limited circumstances
 19 when a 60(b) motion does not interfere with the policies
 20 of the habeas jurisprudence, and in those limited number
 21 of cases, which includes this one, it is appropriate to
 22 use 60(b).
 23 QUESTION: Well, I thought the Second Circuit
 24 was the only case that really supported you --
 25 MR. LIEBMAN: Oh, no.

17

1 QUESTION: -- in this area as to whether a 60(b)
 2 rule can be used as a substitute.
 3 MR. LIEBMAN: No, Your Honor. We don't at all
 4 stand on the Second Circuit approach to this. The
 5 majority rule is that it is a case-by-case analysis. 
 6 It's -- for example -- the Dunlap case where Judge Posner
 7 recently cited all of the lower court opinions, and what
 8 he said was, the majority rule is that you have to look. 
 9 You have to say, is this the kind of 60(b) that avoids the
 10 problems that successive petitions are -- cause that we
 11 have a rule for? If they do, decide the 60(b) motion. If
 12 not --
 13 QUESTION: How -- how long after the district
 14 court ruled that your claims were not -- not exhausted,
 15 how much time elapsed between then and the time you filed 16 your Rule 60 motion?
 17 MR. LIEBMAN: We filed the Rule --
 18 QUESTION: 3-1/2 years, wasn't it?
 19 MR. LIEBMAN: But it was the key point --
 20 QUESTION: Just answer my question.
 21 MR. LIEBMAN: Yes. Yes. Yes, Your Honor --
 22 QUESTION: It was 3-1/2 years?
 23 MR. LIEBMAN: -- I think 3-1/2 years is the
 24 right -- but the reason is that the trigger for the 60(b)
 25 motion did not come down until June 2001.

18

1 QUESTION: That's true, but the -- now I'm
 2 thinking, when I read the Sixth Circuit's opinion again,
 3 they're not really saying anything different. I think
 4 they must mean -- I grant you it can be read either way,
 5 but I can't believe that they mean every 60(b) motion no
 6 matter what is second or successive.
 7 It seems to have arisen in cases where they had
 8 good reason to think that the 60(b) motion in that case
 9 was second or successive, as in your case they are looking
 10 at the 60(b) motion as a substitute for a new petition for
 11 the reason that it was dismissed the first time as a
 12 procedural default, which is the end of this matter.
 13 MR. LIEBMAN: Well --
 14 QUESTION: And you didn't appeal it. Rather,
 15 for whatever set of reasons, you wait -- I mean, not 16 saying it was your fault, but you wait and go back and do
 17 this other thing.
 18 MR. LIEBMAN: Well, Your Honor, two points.
 19 QUESTION: So is there -- is there really a
 20 minority rule at all?
 21 MR. LIEBMAN: Well --
 22 QUESTION: Is there some court that really meant
 23 it, that no matter what, 60(b) is always second or
 24 successive?
 25 MR. LIEBMAN: That is the argument that the

19

1 State made here, and it's what the district court said,
 2 and I can tell you the district court believed it, but it
 3 doesn't matter here. I don't want to get off on that,
 4 because we think that whatever the rule ought to be, this
 5 is the kind of 60(b) motion that is not successive for two
 6 reasons.
 7 First of all, it is -- it relies upon legal and
 8 factual issues that are entirely within the four corners
 9 of the original proceeding. There's nothing new here. 
 10 The law, the facts, the evidence, everything is the same.
 11 Secondly, so that means you're not getting
 12 out --
 13 QUESTION: Well, the law's new. I mean, that's
 14 your whole point.
 15 MR. LIEBMAN: 
 Well, but it isn't new, Your 16 Honor. It was a declaration of the law as it existed all
 17 the way back in 1967.
 18 QUESTION: Well, all right, I'll --
 19 MR. LIEBMAN: But it's like the Fiore case, Your
 20 Honor, where the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said yes, we
 21 came down with this interpretation of the State statute,
 22 and it's true the lower courts had all seen it differently
 23 up to that point, but we were telling you what the statute
 24 meant all the way back, and this Court treated it as,
 25 quote, old law.

20

1 QUESTION: But then you said you didn't need to
 2 put it in your -- make a cross-appeal of it because you
 3 didn't think it was a tenable argument, so you can't -- I
 4 don't -- I don't see how you could have it both ways, to
 5 say it was the law all along, but we didn't have to say
 6 that that was the law because O'Sullivan --
 7 MR. LIEBMAN: Well, because --
 8 QUESTION: -- hadn't come down, or had just come
 9 down.
 10 MR. LIEBMAN: Well, Your Honor, what O'Sullivan
 11 says is, if there is a clear statement of law by State
 12 law, by rule or decision that says -- as the South
 13 Carolina-Arizona provisions cited in this paragraph say --
 14 that this particular discretionary review procedure,
 15 quote, is not available, then the Supreme Court and 16 the Federal courts will respect it, but otherwise, if
 17 we don't know what the law is, or it's not clear, then
 18 we don't need to respect it, so that was --
 19 QUESTION: But the appellate -- the appellate
 20 brief in this case, the brief in the Sixth Circuit, when
 21 the -- when the prosecutor was appealing on the
 22 ineffective assistance of counsel, that was filed before
 23 O'Sullivan came down, wasn't it?
 24 MR. LIEBMAN: The State's brief was filed
 25 before, petitioner's brief filed after.

21

1 QUESTION: But the point at which you could have
 2 filed a cross-appeal was before.
 3 MR. LIEBMAN: Oh, Your Honor, that's a very
 4 important point. In our certificate of probable cause to
 5 appeal we asked the district judge, starting with point 1,
 6 the prosecutorial misconduct claims and the procedural
 7 default ruling on them is what we want to take up to the
 8 court of appeals on our appeal, and the district court
 9 granted a CPC -- a certificate of probable cause -- on
 10 that ground, so that was in the case, it was in the
 11 appeal, and it was specifically in the mind -- well, it
 12 was on the paper that this was the issue that the cross-
 13 appeal was going to be focused on.
 14 QUESTION: I thought you didn't appeal. I
 15 thought you did not appeal the first time -- we're back in 16 the year 2000, or early 2001.
 17 MR. LIEBMAN: '99, actually.
 18 QUESTION: '99?
 19 MR. LIEBMAN: Yes.
 20 QUESTION: All right. At that time I thought
 21 you did not appeal the district court's ruling that you
 22 had procedurally defaulted because you hadn't exhausted
 23 claims X, Y, and Z, and the time had run.
 24 MR. LIEBMAN: Well, all I would say --
 25 QUESTION: Am I right about that?

22

1 MR. LIEBMAN: You're right, but they were in the
 2 certificate of probable cause, which is -- you have to get
 3 that first, but of course the court of appeals doesn't
 4 reach your certificate of probable cause.
 5 QUESTION: No, no, so I don't see how that helps
 6 you.
 7 MR. LIEBMAN: Well, I'm just saying -- well, it
 8 does help in this sense, Your Honor, I think, which is
 9 that until O'Sullivan came down and removed the argument
 10 that petitioner thought he had, he was planning to raise
 11 it, but when O'Sullivan came down, after the CPC, but
 12 before he actually got to file his brief, now suddenly
 13 the claim that he wanted to raise looked frivolous,
 14 because there was not a declaration of State law on the
 15 point.
 16 There came to be a declaration of State law, and
 17 when it came sua sponte, it happened to say, because the
 18 court in Tennessee believed that this to be -- was the
 19 case -- that the law of Tennessee has always been since
 20 1967 that this was never part of the post-conviction
 21 review process, so --
 22 QUESTION: Hasn't the Sixth Circuit had an
 23 opinion on that subject as to whether the rule promulgated
 24 by the Tennessee Supreme Court was a change, or was it
 25 not?

23

1 MR. LIEBMAN: No, it has not. The issue is
 2 percolating in the lower courts and in the Sixth Circuit,
 3 but it has not ruled yet.
 4 QUESTION: But isn't the --
 5 QUESTION: The Sixth Circuit did -- the Sixth
 6 Circuit had held before in a case arising out of Kentucky
 7 that if you don't go to the top court, you have not
 8 exhausted.
 9 MR. LIEBMAN: They said that in Kentucky based
 10 upon a Kentucky Supreme Court decision in 1985.
 11 QUESTION: Right.
 12 MR. LIEBMAN: After that point, there are five
 13 or six decisions of the Sixth Circuit saying that failure
 14 to exhaust that remedy is failure to exhaust. There is no
 15 similar decision in Tennessee at all in the court of 16 appeals before O'Sullivan came down, because the
 17 understanding of practice there, and I know because I
 18 practiced there at that time, was that this didn't need to
 19 be exhausted.
 20 QUESTION: All right, so isn't the right way to
 21 do this, if you were writing it from scratch, we have the
 22 statute, you simply say, look, this is what second and
 23 successives are for. When the law changes just in the
 24 middle of the case, bring a second and successive. That's
 25 the rare case where it should be allowed.

24

1 MR. LIEBMAN: The law did not change.
 2 QUESTION: I mean, I don't --
 3 QUESTION: But I mean what happened to you. 
 4 Isn't that the case that they're there for?
 5 MR. LIEBMAN: This -- the second and successive
 6 is designed to avoid every change in the law being the
 7 basis for a habeas petition, but this is not a change in
 8 the law. It's exactly -- every petitioner literally
 9 argued that not only is this discretionary, so it should
 10 not be exhausted, but he also said the nature of this
 11 discretionary process shouldn't be exhausted because it's
 12 different from post-conviction.
 13 QUESTION: Well, may I ask you one more
 14 question? If it had merely been a change in Tennessee
 15 law, that would not have been a predicate for a second and 16 successive habeas, would it?
 17 MR. LIEBMAN: Absolutely. If it is a change
 18 of law, it's preempted by the terms of the successive
 19 statute which says, we've got a rule here for changes in
 20 the law, but that's why this isn't successive, because
 21 this is not a change in the law, it's within the four
 22 corners --
 23 QUESTION: But doesn't that foreclose you,
 24 because when you're -- if it's not second and successive
 25 as defined by AEDPA, that means those are the only kind

25

1 you can bring?
 2 MR. LIEBMAN: No, Your Honor --
 3 QUESTION: Not that you can pull something else
 4 in under Rule 60.
 5 MR. LIEBMAN: No, Your Honor.
 6 QUESTION: No --
 7 MR. LIEBMAN: The State agrees if it's fraud,
 8 if -- Martinez-Villareal, where you've got some State
 9 court decision that changes everything --
 10 QUESTION: Well --
 11 MR. LIEBMAN: -- it's got to be --
 12 QUESTION: -- are you suggesting there was fraud
 13 here?
 14 MR. LIEBMAN: No, no, no, I'm saying, Your
 15 Honor, that there are certain circumstances where 16 something that is literally second in time does not
 17 qualify as a second or successive petition that triggers
 18 2244, and so we need to know what that is, and the two
 19 standards are when it is within the four corners of the
 20 first petition and it completely undermines --
 21 QUESTION: Now, what's -- what's the authority
 22 for that statement?
 23 MR. LIEBMAN: The authority is Martinez-
 24 Villareal, Slack, and Calderon, and a huge body of lower
 25 court law that establishes those very, very narrow

26

1 circumstances where it's so tied into the first petition
 2 because it's the same facts, and it so undermines that
 3 first judgment that there's no judgment left, that you
 4 need something to substitute for it, but you don't have a
 5 successive petition.
 6 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Liebman. I take it
 7 you're reserving your time?
 8 MR. LIEBMAN: Yes, I am.
 9 QUESTION: General Summers.
 10 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL G. SUMMERS
 11 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 12 GENERAL SUMMERS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
 13 and may it please the Court:
 14 This Court lacks jurisdiction of this case and
 15 the writ should be dismissed, but if this Court concludes 16 that it does have jurisdiction, then the alleged 60(b)
 17 motion was a prohibited second or successive application
 18 because it attempted to revisit a prior final adjudication
 19 based upon alleged error of fact or law.
 20 Turning to the jurisdictional issue, the court
 21 of appeals did not have jurisdiction to review the
 22 transfer order. The transfer order was not a final order. 
 23 It had no jurisdiction in the district court. The
 24 district court had no jurisdiction over the -- over the
 25 motion because it considered it as what it was. It was a

27

1 second or successive application.
 2 QUESTION: Doesn't the jurisdictional issue
 3 really turn on whether or not it was a second or
 4 successive?
 5 GENERAL SUMMERS: No, Your Honor, it does not. 
 6 Under the gatekeeping authority of 2244(b)(3) of AEDPA,
 7 then the sold province as to determine whether or not a
 8 second or successive application should be granted or
 9 should be denied is in the province of the Sixth Circuit.
 10 QUESTION: But is it strictly in the province of
 11 the Sixth Circuit to determine that what it has before it
 12 is a request for something that should be called a second
 13 or successive petition within the meaning of the statute? 
 14 If it is, they've got the final word, but whether it is is
 15 a separate question.
 16 GENERAL SUMMERS: Your Honor, our position is
 17 that you can't separate these two functions. Under AEDPA,
 18 and under the clear enactment of Congress, when Congress
 19 gave the court of appeals the exclusive and sole
 20 jurisdiction as to whether or not a -- an application or
 21 leave for application for a second or successive should be
 22 granted or denied, it also gave them the exclusive
 23 authority to determine whether it was --
 24 QUESTION: Well, it didn't do so in so many
 25 words. I mean, is your argument that if we split this

28

1 question into a) jurisdictional fact, b) the authority of
 2 the court if the jurisdictional fact is present, if we
 3 split those two questions that there's going to be
 4 constant litigation over the jurisdictional fact, and
 5 that's why we ought to read the statute your way, or is
 6 there some point of text that is not occurring to me that
 7 supports you?
 8 GENERAL SUMMERS: Absolutely, Your Honor.
 9 QUESTION: Well, it's one or the other.
 10 GENERAL SUMMERS: Well --
 11 (Laughter.)
 12 QUESTION: Is it text or policy?
 13 GENERAL SUMMERS: It's the first one, Your
 14 Honor.
 15 QUESTION: Okay.
 16 GENERAL SUMMERS: If you were to split those two
 17 decisions that the court of appeal has jurisdiction over,
 18 then there would be a proliferation of appeal of that
 19 first predicate decision. The decision, the first --
 20 QUESTION: Well, is it going to be -- I mean, is
 21 it going to be a difficult question in most cases? I
 22 mean, this is an extraordinary case. You can see how the
 23 jurisdictional fact question gets raised here, but you
 24 know, in most cases is this going to be even a colorable
 25 issue?

29

1 GENERAL SUMMERS: Your Honor, I don't -- I would
 2 not -- I don't think this is, frankly, an extraordinary
 3 case to determine whether or not it was a second or
 4 successive. That is to say that when the Sixth Circuit
 5 got the transfer order, they saw just what it was, and
 6 that it was a second or successive application --
 7 QUESTION: Yes, you say that, but the relief
 8 sought in the 60(b) motion was not relief from the State
 9 court judgment. It was relief from the final judgment in
 10 the habeas proceeding because of the Tennessee rule, so
 11 they asked to reopen the habeas proceeding, not to file a
 12 second habeas proceeding, and they asked to reopen it, and
 13 just to have a claim which was undecided in that
 14 proceeding decided, which had never been decided, so there
 15 was not asked for second consideration of a claim, just 16 for the first consideration.
 17 GENERAL SUMMERS: Yes, Your Honor. What they
 18 asked for was the relitigation of a claim that had been --
 19 that -- that --
 20 QUESTION: Not of a claim, a first litigation of
 21 a claim.
 22 GENERAL SUMMERS: They -- they asked for -- they
 23 asked for the relitigation of a prior final determination,
 24 which we -- we submit and we -- our position is that this
 25 was, in fact, a second --

30

1 QUESTION: Did they ask in the 60(b) motion for
 2 relief from the State court judgment which would be the
 3 relief requested in the habeas proceeding?
 4 GENERAL SUMMERS: They asked -- I'm sorry.
 5 QUESTION: Did they ask for relief from the
 6 State court judgment in the 60(b) motion, or just from the
 7 habeas court judgment?
 8 GENERAL SUMMERS: They asked for relief from
 9 the -- from the habeas judgment in the -- in the district
 10 court --
 11 QUESTION: So then it was a 60(b) motion,
 12 because that's what 60(b) is directed at, where the second
 13 or successive petition would have asked for relief from
 14 the State court judgment.
 15 GENERAL SUMMERS: 
 Well, they alleged that it was 16 a 60(b) motion, but when the district court received the
 17 motion, the district court put substance over form and saw
 18 clearly that it was a second or successive --
 19 QUESTION: Well, you call it that, but supposing
 20 instead of the -- the Tennessee rule, they had been able
 21 to demonstrate it -- very improbable, just to give the
 22 hypothesis out -- that a waiver of the claim for the
 23 prosecutorial misconduct had been executed and the waiver
 24 was false, that there was a fraud on the court in -- in
 25 having that issue precluded from review. Would a 60(b)

31

1 motion have been permissible then?
 2 GENERAL SUMMERS: It would be the inherent
 3 authority of the -- of the district court to take care of
 4 a situation of fraud on the court.
 5 QUESTION: By granting a 60(b) motion?
 6 GENERAL SUMMERS: Well, we don't think it would
 7 even have to be a 60(b) motion.
 8 QUESTION: Well, wouldn't that be the office of
 9 a 60(b) motion, to correct that very fraud?
 10 GENERAL SUMMERS: Fraud on the court that would
 11 impugn the very integrity of the prior final adjudication
 12 would, in fact, be -- be --
 13 QUESTION: Well, you go on a different section
 14 of Rule 60, wouldn't you --
 15 QUESTION: That's correct.
 16 GENERAL SUMMERS: Yes.
 17 QUESTION: -- the section of Rule 60 that
 18 specially deals with fraud.
 19 GENERAL SUMMERS: That's right.
 20 QUESTION: But in that situation a 60(b) motion
 21 would be permissible under that section?
 22 GENERAL SUMMERS: If there was a fraud on the
 23 court.
 24 QUESTION: Right.
 25 GENERAL SUMMERS: But that -- but the fraud on

32

1 the court would undermine the complete efficacies of the
 2 proceedings, and that the final judgment wouldn't even be
 3 final, because it would be a sham.
 4 QUESTION: Well, but you have to file a motion
 5 and have those facts developed in order to do it, and
 6 60(b) is the avenue for doing that.
 7 GENERAL SUMMERS: That -- I mean, that could be
 8 a possible avenue, but that -- but that would only go as
 9 to the fraud on the integrity --
 10 QUESTION: And here, the relief requested is
 11 precisely the same, namely that one claim was not heard
 12 which was in the case, for a reason that was -- turned out
 13 to be a gross mistake of the law. They thought the law
 14 was exhaustion because of a rule of law, and it turns out
 15 they were wrong, so you have -- instead of fraud, you have 16 a mistake of law.
 17 Now, maybe that doesn't -- doesn't justify 60(b)
 18 relief, but it certainly is a classic case of what 60(b)
 19 is directed to -- to solve.
 20 GENERAL SUMMERS: Well --
 21 QUESTION: Directed at the final judgment in the
 22 habeas proceeding as opposed to the final judgment in the
 23 State proceeding.
 24 GENERAL SUMMERS: Of -- of course, Your Honor,
 25 that argument would fly in the face of the finality

33

1 requirements of AEDPA, which only -- which only gives
 2 us -- which only gives us limited circumstances to
 3 relitigate --
 4 QUESTION: But that's true of my fraud case,
 5 too.
 6 GENERAL SUMMERS: Well, but in the fraud case,
 7 Your Honor, the fraud on the court means that the original
 8 judgment is a complete sham, is a complete sham, and there
 9 was no --
 10 QUESTION: And here it isn't a sham, it was just
 11 a mistake. They misread the law.
 12 GENERAL SUMMERS: Well, they want it both ways,
 13 if it please the Court. They either say that it was a new
 14 rule or an -- or an old rule that clarified Tennessee law. 
 15 If it was a new rule, then that would contravene 2244(b) 16 under AEDPA.
 17 QUESTION: But that --
 18 QUESTION: What is the right way to do it? That
 19 is, in your opinion, how -- suppose we had a -- we have a
 20 defendant, a petitioner, a convicted person, and he has a
 21 whole lot of claims, and there he is in Federal court and
 22 he brought all of his claims up to the State supreme court
 23 but for three, then he suddenly thinks, oh my God, I wish
 24 I'd brought those up, too, and the district judge says,
 25 well, you sure had to, so you lost them, because it's too

34

1 late now. Procedural default. It seems obviously right,
 2 doesn't even appeal that part of the case.
 3 But while the case is on appeal, this Court
 4 says, he didn't have to go to the State supreme court with
 5 those three claims if the State supreme court agrees, and
 6 then State supreme court then does.
 7 All right. Now, there he is. Under the law as
 8 it is right now, he can make his three points. He can
 9 make his three claims, and yet as it was before, he
 10 couldn't, and it's right on the case, it's still ongoing. 
 11 What's supposed to happen?
 12 GENERAL SUMMERS: When the --
 13 QUESTION: In your opinion is there just -- is
 14 there no way a person could say, judge, please read the
 15 supreme court and the Tennessee court, and you'll see that 16 your ruling was wrong, and believe me, that's right, so
 17 what is he supposed to do?
 18 GENERAL SUMMERS: A prior final determination --
 19 a prior final determination by the district court as to
 20 the procedural default should be conclusive.
 21 QUESTION: So you're saying he's just out of
 22 luck, nothing?
 23 GENERAL SUMMERS: Yes, sir, because --
 24 because --
 25 QUESTION: It seems terribly unfair --

35

1 GENERAL SUMMERS: Well, but we -- yes, Your
 2 Honor, but under the provisions of AEDPA there are two
 3 circumstances where he could file a second or successive,
 4 which we say is what he has, in fact, done here. One, of
 5 course, is if it's a new claim involving a constitutional
 6 law that's made retroactive by this very Court, or newly-
 7 discovered evidence to show factual innocence, but when
 8 that court -- when that district court -- makes a final, a
 9 prior final adjudication, then that is -- that should
 10 be -- that should be final. He should appeal that
 11 decision. He should appeal that decision --
 12 QUESTION: General Summers --
 13 GENERAL SUMMERS: -- through the normal
 14 appellate process.
 15 QUESTION: General Summers --
 16 GENERAL SUMMERS: He did not in this case.
 17 QUESTION: You -- are you -- you're making the
 18 general point that's not peculiar to AEDPA? I -- tell me
 19 if my understanding is correct -- that 60(b) is not
 20 supposed to do service in place of an appeal.
 21 GENERAL SUMMERS: Yes, Your Honor.
 22 QUESTION: So if a district court rules
 23 incorrectly, and you didn't appeal that, and then there's
 24 a clarifying decision by some other court that really
 25 shows the district court was incorrect on the procedural

36

1 default, you can't then say, ah, give me the relief under
 2 60(b) that I could have gotten if I had taken a timely
 3 appeal.
 4 GENERAL SUMMERS: Yes, Your Honor. If the --
 5 QUESTION: And that's wholly apart from AEDPA.
 6 GENERAL SUMMERS: Yes, Your Honor, that's
 7 correct. If this petitioner had decided that instead, the
 8 district court found that he had improperly exhausted his
 9 remedies under State law, that he'd showed no cause of
 10 prejudice or fundamental miscarriage of justice, that he
 11 had procedurally defaulted, and that he, his claim was --
 12 it was conclusive that he had no habeas relief, if the
 13 petitioner had wanted to appeal that -- had wanted to find
 14 out whether or not the district court was wrong -- he
 15 should have appealed that case. He did not. Under --
 16 under the case law but also under 60(b) doctrine a 60(b)
 17 motion is not a substitute for an appeal. He did not
 18 appeal that adjudication by the district judge. He's out
 19 of business so far as that's concerned.
 20 What he filed in the district court, the
 21 district judge got that document, he looked at substance,
 22 and the district court said, this is a second or
 23 successive. The only jurisdiction in the world to
 24 determine whether to grant or deny second or successive is
 25 the court of appeals. When that court of appeals got that

37

1 transfer order, there was no termination. They got what
 2 was --
 3 QUESTION: Is it conceivable that a district
 4 judge might erroneously in some case call something second
 5 or successive and it really wasn't? Is it ever possible
 6 for him to do -- make that?
 7 GENERAL SUMMERS: Well, human beings, it's
 8 certainly possible.
 9 QUESTION: And if he does make a mistake, what's
 10 the remedy for it?
 11 GENERAL SUMMERS: There could be a motion to
 12 transfer in the court of appeals. The court of appeals
 13 if, in fact, finds that it was improvidently transferred,
 14 could transfer it back. That would be that remedy, Your
 15 Honor.
 16 QUESTION: But what if instead -- I gave you a
 17 fraud example -- instead of that it was a mistake. The
 18 judge thought that the petitioner had waived the case. 
 19 They thought there was a document in the file waiving this
 20 issue and he was just dead wrong, and he said, then the --
 21 after the decision -- the final decision in the habeas
 22 case, the judge -- the litigant finds out that the judge
 23 incorrectly relied on a mistaken representation of fact. 
 24 Could he not file a 60(b) to correct that?
 25 GENERAL SUMMERS: No, Your Honor. If it was a

38

1 mistake of fact, if it did not go to -- to undermine the
 2 integrity of that being a final adjudication, no.
 3 QUESTION: Well, it -- it undermines it in the
 4 sense that it denied the litigant a hearing on a claim
 5 asserted in the habeas proceeding, namely, the
 6 prosecutorial misconduct. He just never got a hearing on
 7 that.
 8 GENERAL SUMMERS: If he were -- if it were
 9 something of the nature of -- of denying him the
 10 opportunity to have a hearing, or if, in fact --
 11 QUESTION: That's exactly what it was here, too.
 12 GENERAL SUMMERS: Well, no, sir. He did -- he
 13 received a hearing. He received a hearing, Your Honor,
 14 that -- and in that hearing it was determined by the court
 15 that he had improperly --
 16 QUESTION: He failed to exhaust.
 17 GENERAL SUMMERS: -- Failed to exhaust --
 18 improperly, that he --
 19 QUESTION: And that ruling was wrong.
 20 GENERAL SUMMERS: -- failed to show cause of
 21 prejudice, that there was no miscarriage of justice, and
 22 that he was conclusively entitled to no habeas relief in
 23 the district court, and that was a conclusive final
 24 determination, and if he had felt like the court was
 25 wrong, he should have filed an appeal in the Sixth

39

1 Circuit.
 2 QUESTION: Well, I understand that argument, but
 3 if -- but I don't understand your position if it was based
 4 on a mistake of fact, rather than a mistake of law. Here
 5 was just a clear mistake of law. The parties all
 6 misunderstood what the law, as later explained by the
 7 Tennessee court, was. It was -- he did not -- he had, in
 8 fact, exhausted.
 9 GENERAL SUMMERS: Your Honor, if he had thought
 10 the judge had made a mistake, he should have appealed.
 11 QUESTION: He didn't think so. He didn't know
 12 that 'til Tennessee adopted its rule --
 13 GENERAL SUMMERS: Well --
 14 QUESTION: -- which was 2 years later.
 15 GENERAL SUMMERS: 
 Well, his argument that 16 Tennessee adopted a rule that either is a new rule or an
 17 old rule is not of much import as far as we're concerned,
 18 because the Rule 39 that he relies upon changed nothing in
 19 Tennessee law --
 20 QUESTION: Right.
 21 GENERAL SUMMERS: -- so far as appellate
 22 process.
 23 QUESTION: But they changed the understanding of
 24 the district judge and the litigants. They thought the
 25 law was otherwise.

40

1 GENERAL SUMMERS: Well, I think -- I think the
 2 district court knew what the law was when he made that
 3 decision, but certainly the Sixth Circuit knew what the
 4 law was.
 5 QUESTION: You think he knew what the Tennessee
 6 court was later going to decide?
 7 GENERAL SUMMERS: Well, actually, the --
 8 QUESTION: Because what he did is flatly
 9 inconsistent with what the Tennessee court decided.
 10 GENERAL SUMMERS: What the Tennessee court later
 11 decided, Your Honor, did not change Tennessee law so far
 12 as discretionary review at all -- at all.
 13 QUESTION: But it did demonstrate, did it not,
 14 that the district judge was wrong in his ruling on
 15 exhaustion?
 16 GENERAL SUMMERS: The district judge was exactly
 17 correct on his decision.
 18 QUESTION: That's the question. That's the
 19 ultimate question that I think this Court granted cert to
 20 decide, but then we discovered that there are all these --
 21 this procedural -- the question whether a Tennessee court
 22 saying you don't have to exhaust does service for the
 23 Federal courts. That is, the Federal courts could say
 24 it's an open question.
 25 You have to exhaust the remedies that are

41

1 available to you. You could have requested review. You
 2 didn't request review. We don't care if Tennessee says,
 3 ah, you don't have to, because that's -- that ruling would
 4 be made only for purposes of saying, let's get into the
 5 Federal court. I take it that's your position.
 6 GENERAL SUMMERS: The decision as to the
 7 availability of a remedy is a State decision. The
 8 decision as to what has been exhausted is a Federal
 9 decision, Your Honor.
 10 QUESTION: Yes.
 11 GENERAL SUMMERS: The Rule 39 that the
 12 petitioner relies upon did not change discretionary review
 13 in Tennessee one iota. As a matter of fact, the Tennessee
 14 Rule of Appellate Procedure 11 says in its comment that
 15 Rule 39 does not change TRAP -- as we call it, TRAP 11 -16 whatsoever. Discretionary review was in '95, when he did
 17 not appeal to the supreme court, as well as in June 28,
 18 2001, an absolute available remedy under the normal
 19 appellate processes in Tennessee.
 20 QUESTION: So on your view, the district court
 21 was right when the district court said the first time
 22 around, sorry, you didn't exhaust.
 23 GENERAL SUMMERS: Your Honor, our view is that
 24 the district court was right in 1998 when he ruled that
 25 the claims were procedurally defaulted, and if this

42

1 case -- if this case were to go back to the district court
 2 today, he would rule that the claims had been
 3 procedurally --
 4 QUESTION: Well, that -- we don't know that 
 5 because I think it's an open question whether -- after
 6 O'Sullivan -- the position taken in O'Sullivan would apply
 7 when the State court says you don't have to exhaust.
 8 GENERAL SUMMERS: But there's no question
 9 that -- there is no question that in 1998, when the
 10 district court found that the -- that the issues had been
 11 procedurally defaulted, and that there had been no showing
 12 of cause in prejudice, no miscarriage of justice, that
 13 that was a conclusive final determination.
 14 What this -- what this petitioner attempts to do
 15 is to -- under the guise of a post-judgment pleading -16 avoid or evade the second or successive restriction. This
 17 flies in the face of AEDPA, would be a mockery of the
 18 finality requirements of AEDPA, and we would submit to the
 19 Court that the transfer to the court of appeals was a
 20 proper transfer, and that the court of appeals properly
 21 determined the gatekeeping criteria was satisfied, the
 22 writ should be dismissed or, in the alternative, the
 23 decision of the court of appeals should be affirmed.
 24 QUESTION: Thank you, General Summers.
 25 Mr. Zidlicky, we'll hear from you.

1 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. ZIDLICKY
 2 ON BEHALF OF AMICI CURIAE, STATE OF ALABAMA, ET AL.
 3 MR. ZIDLICKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 4 please the Court:
 5 I'd like to start by first responding to Justice
 6 Stevens' question, in which he said that the Rule 60(b)
 7 motion didn't seek the relief of granting of Federal
 8 habeas. It actually did. In the joint appendix in 170,
 9 the court -- the petitioner sought relief from the State
 10 court judgment in bullet point -- I believe it's five, but
 11 in any event, I think underlying that is the question of
 12 whether there had been a prior --
 13 QUESTION: You say the 60(b) motion was directed
 14 at the State court judgment, is that what you're telling
 15 me?
 16 MR. ZIDLICKY: Yes. Yes, Justice Stevens.
 17 QUESTION: And not at the habeas -- not asking
 18 the habeas court to vacate the ruling on the -- on --
 19 denying habeas and setting it down for a ruling on the --
 20 on the prosecutorial misconduct?
 21 MR. ZIDLICKY: For both. For both, Justice
 22 Stevens. He asked for both of those, and I think -- he
 23 sought to reopen the judgment, and he also sought -- he
 24 sought in bullet point 5 to -- or, relief from the State
 25 court judgment, and that's in the joint appendix.

44

1 The question --
 2 QUESTION: But 60(b) just gets him the first
 3 step, and if he succeeds in the first step, then he goes
 4 further and says, okay, relieve me from the State court
 5 judgment.
 6 MR. ZIDLICKY: Well, I was just responding just
 7 to Justice Stevens' point that he didn't seek that relief
 8 in his Rule 60(b) motion. He actually did, but the -- but
 9 the underlying question is --
 10 QUESTION: But he's doing it simply because he
 11 is saying, I guess, that's where I'm trying to get to
 12 ultimately.
 13 MR. ZIDLICKY: What he's trying to do is, he's
 14 trying to relitigate a claim that had been adjudicated
 15 against him through Rule 60(b), and this Court said in 16 Calderon that you can't -- that the requirements of
 17 2244(b) can't be evaded, and one of those requirements is,
 18 you can't relitigate a claim that has been adjudicated.
 19 QUESTION: Well, he's not relitigating a claim
 20 that's been adjudicated, he's relitigating -- he wants to
 21 litigate a claim that had not been adjudicated. He wanted
 22 a ruling on the merits of his claim, which he never got.
 23 MR. ZIDLICKY: No, Justice Stevens, there was an
 24 adjudication of his claim. There was an adjudication of
 25 his claim by the district court which said his claim was

45

1 procedurally defaulted --
 2 QUESTION: Yes.
 3 MR. ZIDLICKY: -- and that he had failed to
 4 establish cause and prejudice, and that --
 5 QUESTION: Correct, but they didn't get a ruling
 6 on the merits of the claim.
 7 MR. ZIDLICKY: No, he --
 8 QUESTION: They just ruled that it was
 9 procedurally defaulted because it had not been exhausted.
 10 MR. ZIDLICKY: Well, that's -- but I don't think
 11 that's right, Justice Stevens. In this Court's cases in
 12 Stewart and Slack, the Court made clear that in
 13 determining whether there had been a prior -- the language
 14 that the Court had used was whether there had been a prior
 15 adjudication of the claim. 
 Here, there was a prior 16 adjudication of the claim. This Court's precedent, going
 17 back to Wainwright v. Sykes, Coleman v. Thompson, and --
 18 QUESTION: But the adjudication to which you
 19 refer is a holding that it was procedurally defaulted
 20 because the -- they had not been exhausted in the Supreme
 21 Court of Tennessee. Is that not correct?
 22 MR. ZIDLICKY: That's correct, Justice Stevens.
 23 QUESTION: And that amounts to an adjudication
 24 on the merits, but in fact, the merits had never been
 25 decided.

46

1 MR. ZIDLICKY: No, it is -- it's an adjudication
 2 for purposes of -- it's -- for purposes of determining
 3 whether he can come back and file to relitigate the issue,
 4 come back and --
 5 QUESTION: Right, it's an adjudication that has
 6 finality, which merits adjudications usually do, but it's
 7 a finality adjudication that does not rest upon any
 8 finding about the underlying merits of the claim that he
 9 wanted to bring for relief. Isn't that clear?
 10 MR. ZIDLICKY: That's not the test that this
 11 Court has adopted in --
 12 QUESTION: I'm not asking you whether it's --
 13 I'm just asking you as a descriptive matter --
 14 MR. ZIDLICKY: I don't -- you're right, Justice
 15 Souter, he didn't make a determination regarding the 16 underlying merit of the constitutional claim, but --
 17 QUESTION: Okay, and we use the term, I think --
 18 correct me if I'm wrong, we use the term, merits
 19 determination, to refer to a determination that is
 20 binding, i.e., he can't do something back in the State
 21 court and then come back and try again here. We call that
 22 a determination on the merits, but there are two kinds of
 23 merits determinations.
 24 One is a finding of default which cannot be
 25 cured. Second is a finding which may involve default, but

47

1 may involve a determination on the merits of the
 2 underlying claim, and this is just a default kind of
 3 merits, not an underlying claim kind of merits finality,
 4 isn't that correct, just as a descriptive matter?
 5 MR. ZIDLICKY: I think it's correct as a
 6 descriptive matter to -- but with one qualification. What
 7 you're saying is that there is an exception for -- I think
 8 in substance what you're saying is, you can continue to
 9 relitigate claims of procedural default because they're,
 10 quote, not on the merits, but I think the way --
 11 QUESTION: Well, maybe you can and maybe you
 12 can't. His argument here is, this is one that I ought to
 13 be allowed to relitigate, i.e., to litigate despite a
 14 finality judgment, because of something very unusual that
 15 happened as a result of the supreme court's rule change. 16 What he's saying is, this is a special kind
 17 of -- third kind of case in the middle, and you want to
 18 treat this one for 60(b) purposes like a non-final
 19 determination. I think that's the argument.
 20 MR. ZIDLICKY: Justice Souter, and perhaps
 21 this -- this is -- I don't think this is an exceptional
 22 case in this regard. When he went back --
 23 QUESTION: Well, he may be wrong that it's an
 24 exceptional case, but that's the argument that he's
 25 making, isn't it?

48

1 MR. ZIDLICKY: Well, the argument that he's
 2 making is, he's entitled to relitigate a claim that has
 3 been adjudicated against the --
 4 QUESTION: No, he's not making that blanket
 5 statement. He's saying that in a case like this, in which
 6 the finality which is claimed does not rest on a merits
 7 determination, I ought to have a chance under 60(b).
 8 MR. ZIDLICKY: Well, I do think that this is --
 9 this case is fundamentally different than the case in
 10 Stewart and Slack. In those cases, what the court had
 11 determined was, it wasn't a second or successive habeas
 12 petition. You weren't seeking to relitigate, and the
 13 reason was because you'd never received an adjudication of
 14 the case at all. The court didn't say no to your habeas
 15 claim. It said, not yet.
 16 In Slack, the court said, go -- go exhaust. In
 17 Stewart, the court said, the case is not ripe. Here what
 18 the court -- here what the court -- the district court
 19 told him was, they didn't say not yet, the court said no,
 20 you're going to lose, and you're going to lose based on
 21 precedent from this Court starting with Wainwright v.
 22 Sykes.
 23 Really what they're asking is for an -- a
 24 loophole to this -- to the requirement for second and
 25 successive petitions for procedurally defaulted cases, and

49

1 if that's the loophole, then there's no way to distinguish
 2 that from abuse of -- abuse of the writ cases, because in
 3 both instances, you can make the argument that there
 4 wasn't any ruling on the substantive merits, but there was
 5 a ruling, and the one that's important was, he received an
 6 adjudication, and if he disagreed with that adjudication
 7 he should have --
 8 QUESTION: Could you describe for me what
 9 portion of Rule 60(b) is still operative with reference to
 10 mistakes, given AEDPA? Does AEDPA completely supersede
 11 Rule 60(b) with reference to the category of mistakes and,
 12 if not, how would you characterize or describe for us what
 13 remains of Rule 60(b)?
 14 MR. ZIDLICKY: I think what -- the analysis that
 15 the Court would have to determine is whether there had 16 been an adjudication. If later on there's a claim, after
 17 the court has decided the issue, that there was a mistake
 18 of fact or a mistake of law, the question is, are you
 19 trying to relitigate the issue, and if that's the case
 20 then 60(b) wouldn't apply.
 21 But if you're saying that there was never
 22 adjudication in the first place for the example of a judge
 23 who had been bribed in the first Federal habeas
 24 proceedings, you would say, well, that's not a second or
 25 successive habeas application --

50

1 QUESTION: As to anything that's been
 2 adjudicated, the category of mistakes is removed from Rule
 3 60(b) when AEDPA is in the picture?
 4 MR. ZIDLICKY: I think if there's been an
 5 adjudication, and I think that's the sense that -- in your
 6 decision in Slack -- that's the underlying issue.
 7 Now, it -- that doesn't mean that there's no
 8 relief. You can -- you can try to seek to file a second
 9 or successive habeas application, but this Court in Davis
 10 versus Pitchess made clear that Rule 60(b) is not a way of
 11 circumventing the requirements of AEDPA, and you in
 12 Calderon made clear that what AEDPA prohibits is the
 13 relitigation of a claim that had been adjudicated, and
 14 that's exactly what we have in this case. There had been
 15 an adjudication. 
 He claims that it was wrong. 16 QUESTION: I think -- I think you're saying that
 17 if there's an adjudication, there's no room for a 60(b)
 18 motion predicated on a mistake. That's your submission?
 19 MR. ZIDLICKY: That is my submission. I don't
 20 think there was a mistake here. I --
 21 QUESTION: I understand, but that's your
 22 submission. In construing Rule 60(b), it simply does not
 23 apply if there's been an adjudication, but my suggestion
 24 to you is that the only time 60(b) applies is when you've
 25 got a judgment you want to reopen.

51

1 MR. ZIDLICKY: Well, Your Honor -- and the
 2 reason that 60(b) -- you know, one of the arguments that
 3 petitioner makes here is, they say that, well, these
 4 claims will rarely be granted so you don't have to worry
 5 about it, but the -- but what AEDPA requires is, it says
 6 these claims are -- the -- if you're trying to relitigate
 7 a second or successive habeas application, what it does
 8 is, it takes that away from the district court completely,
 9 the delay in the costs that are associated with that
 10 relitigation.
 11 QUESTION: I agree with everything you say if
 12 you are correct in classifying a particular judgment -- I
 13 mean, a particular claim as a second or successive claim.
 14 MR. ZIDLICKY: Right.
 15 QUESTION: 
 There are some cases, I think, when 16 that classification does not fit the facts.
 17 MR. ZIDLICKY: But I think, though, a
 18 determination of procedural default falls in the heartland
 19 of habeas jurisprudence, and it's the heartland of a
 20 determination that you're not entitled to relief. In
 21 Slack and in Stewart --
 22 QUESTION: So in your view, 60(b) necessarily
 23 has a much more narrow application in AEDPA cases than in
 24 other cases, or in habeas cases than in other cases?
 25 MR. ZIDLICKY: Yes, Justice -- Justice Kennedy,

52

1 I think that's right, and I think the reason why is
 2 because, as this Court explained in Davis versus Pitchess,
 3 you can't use 60(b) to circumvent the substantive
 4 requirements of --
 5 QUESTION: Well, what do they really intend in
 6 Congress if, for example, the court comes up with an
 7 interpretation of a statute that shows the defendant
 8 didn't commit a crime, and there he is in habeas. He's
 9 got a final ruling, denied. Lo and behold the Supreme
 10 Court comes up with a case to say, you never committed a
 11 crime. He looks at AEDPA. He can't find it's a second or
 12 successive because it says, constitutional ruling. What's
 13 he supposed to do? Nothing? And do you think Congress
 14 meant that there was no remedy at all?
 15 MR. ZIDLICKY: 
 I think -- I think what Congress 16 did was, it -- it did identify the criteria that -- that a
 17 district court would look to in determining -- it defined
 18 that criteria, but the one -- the one place that you could
 19 look to is, you could then go back to this Court's
 20 original jurisdiction under 2241 for those exceptional
 21 circumstances.
 22 QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Zidlicky.
 23 Mr. Liebman, you have 3 minutes remaining.
 24 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. LIEBMAN
 25 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

53

1 MR. LIEBMAN: I would like to direct the Court's
 2 attention to pages 12 and 13 of our reply brief, the
 3 yellow brief. On those pages, in the footnote in the text
 4 there are a number of cases that are cited. Every single
 5 one of those cases is a 60(b) case in a habeas or 2255
 6 situation where 60(b) was granted, relief was granted and
 7 it was determined that this was not a second or successive
 8 petition.
 9 In each one of those cases, the reason was
 10 mistake of law, the U.S. Supreme Court or some other court
 11 came down with a new decision, and in every one of those
 12 cases, that issue was not raised on direct appeal to the
 13 court of appeals. It came back on a 60(b). In each case
 14 they had to adjudicate the question of whether it was
 15 reasonable for them not to have raised it in the court of 16 appeals at that time, and in each case they did on the
 17 ground that the new decision that came down changed
 18 everything, and it suddenly made what looked like a
 19 frivolous claim at that time into what was not a frivolous
 20 claim, but, indeed, one on which there was at least a
 21 right to adjudication on the merits.
 22 In some cases they won, in some they lost when
 23 they went to the merits after they got their 60(b) relief,
 24 but the fact is that those cases, including this Court's
 25 GVR in Blackmon v. Money, which was a 60(b) case on a

54

1 successive, or a second, not a successive but a second
 2 habeas petition, were cases where they had not been raised
 3 on appeal, but they -- they were determined to be at least
 4 potentially ones where there was a reasonable basis for
 5 not having done it, and frivolousness, not making
 6 frivolous claims is such a basis. This Court in Gomez and
 7 other cases has been particularly emphatic that habeas
 8 petitioners should not -- especially in capital cases --
 9 should not be raising frivolous claims.
 10 The second thing I want to point to is that the
 11 2244(b)(3)(E), which says that there is no -- it not only
 12 says the Supreme Court can't take a cert petition, it says
 13 that rehearing petitions can't be held in the court of
 14 appeals, but the court of appeals are unanimous in saying,
 15 if the question is whether this is a second or successive 16 petition, that can be reheard. That's not governed by
 17 2244(b)(3)(E).
 18 We can separate that question out, and we can
 19 decide that, and it's exactly the same thing here. The
 20 key case there is Mancuso in the Second Circuit, 166 F.3d
 21 97, so the courts have been separating out those
 22 questions, saying if it's a question of jurisdiction --
 23 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,
 24 Mr. Liebman. The case is submitted.
 25 (Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the

55

1 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
