2 [10:16 a.m.]

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Samson versus California.

5 Mr. Long.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.,

7 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8 MR. LONG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10 The search in this case was not based on

11 individualized suspicion, and no other adequate

12 safeguards limited the police officer's discretion to

13 search Petitioner. For this reason, the search, which

14 would not be permitted by virtually any other State or

15 by the Federal Government, was unreasonable.

16 The Court has reaffirmed many times that the

17 Fourth Amendment does not permit the individual officer

18 in the field to exercise unconstrained discretion to

19 search. The Court has said that the Fourth Amendment

20 is primarily directed at the evil -- it was primarily

21 directed at the evil of general warrants and writs of

22 assistance, and the evil of general warrants and writs

23 of assistance was that they gave individual officers

24 blanket authority to search where they pleased and

25 placed the liberty of every man in the hands of every

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1 petty officer.

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Long --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Long --

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- with respect to

5 liberty, as it -- it's not disputed, is it, that your

6 client could have had his parole revoked even though

7 the search was suspicionless? So, what we're talking about

8 the difference between revocation of parole, on the one

9 hand, and a separate criminal offense. Is that right?

10 MR. LONG: Well, a parolee has conditional

11 liberty. But, at the time of this search, Mr. Samson

12 was on parole, there was no suspicion of any wrongdoing

13 --

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that

15 evidence seized could be introduced, could be a basis

16 to revoke parole.

17 MR. LONG: Oh, well, the Court held, in the

18 Scott case, that the exclusionary rule does not apply

19 at parole revocation hearings. So, if there is an

20 unreasonable search of a parolee that violates the

21 Fourth Amendment, the evidence could not be admitted at

22 a criminal trial, but it could be admitted at a parole

23 revocation --

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, the -- what the -- the

25 consequence here is whether --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. LONG: I --

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- he will have his parole

3 revoked --

4 MR. LONG: I --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- or he will have a

6 separate criminal offense.

7 MR. LONG: I understand your question. In

8 California, Justice Ginsburg, a nonviolent drug

9 offense, the possession of a small amount of an illegal

10 substance, is not a basis for revocation of parole. It

11 is not possible to revoke parole in California for this

12 offense. So, parole revocation would not have been a

13 possibility here.

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

15 suppose, can pursue her own line of questioning, but

16 let me ask you this, because I -- her question suggests

17 this, to me at least. Suppose the parole officer said,

18 "Now, look, I'm going to search you. If you don't

19 consent, then I'm going to revoke your parole."

20 MR. LONG: Well, this, of course, was a

21 police officer, not a parole officer.

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I --

23 MR. LONG: But if --

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- my question was

25 a parole officer, and I'll get to police officer next.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. LONG: All right. I think if a parole

2 officer said, "You must consent to this search" --

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: When you see the --

4 MR. LONG: -- "this particular search" --

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- person on the street, et

6 cetera, et cetera.

7 MR. LONG: "And, if you don't, I'll revoke

8 your" -- I mean, the consent is not, in this case,

9 first. I mean, California has said, the Supreme Court

10 has said, parole, in the parole search condition, is

11 imposed as a matter of law. Your hypothetical poses a

12 question of, could there be knowing and voluntary

13 consent to a search if the consequence of refusing is

14 revocation of parole? I would argue, in that

15 situation, that the consequences of refusal are so dire

16 that, effectively, the parolee would have no real

17 choice but to consent. So, it would be, in a sense, a

18 coerced consent.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why are they dire? I mean,

20 he's just back in the situation he would have been in,

21 did he not comply with the conditions of his parole. I

22 don't see that that's dire. He has a choice. He can

23 stay in prison and --

24 MR. LONG: Well --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and suffer the reduction

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of privacy there, which is much, much greater than

2 being subjected to -- I mean, he -- he cannot even go

3 to the toilet in privacy. Or he can go out on parole,

4 subject to the condition that --

5 MR. LONG: Well --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that he --

7 MR. LONG: I mean --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- he can --

9 MR. LONG: I --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- be searched.

11 MR. LONG: I have two answers to that,

12 Justice Scalia. I mean, first, in California, you

13 finish your prison sentence, and then parole is a

14 separate period that happens. The California Supreme

15 Court said, in People v. Guzman and other cases, parole

16 is not a part of the sentence --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it's --

18 MR. LONG: -- in California.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- but it's also clear from

20 the California statute that it is not a right, that

21 it's a privilege, that you get the privilege of parole

22 in exchange -- in exchange for agreeing to the

23 conditions, one of which is that you can be searched.

24 MR. LONG: Well, it's -- in California, every

25 inmate gets parole. It's a matter of law. It's not a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 privilege -- in Morrissey against Brewer. The Court --

2 in other cases, the Court rejected the rights privilege

3 distinction anyway.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: California statute says it's

5 a privilege, doesn't it?

6 MR. LONG: Yes, in section 3067.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: It does.

8 MR. LONG: But it is -- it is also a --

9 section 3000 of the California penal code says every

10 prisoner gets parole. It is imposed on the prisoner as

11 --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even if the --

13 MR. LONG: -- a matter of law.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- prisoner -- oh, I thought

15 that he can turn it down, and that some prisoners do,

16 if --

17 MR. LONG: Well --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if they decide that they

19 don't want to be subjected to searches.

20 MR. LONG: The California Supreme Court has

21 held, in People v. Reyes, and in other cases cited in

22 our brief, that, in California, parole is not a matter

23 of choice, it is imposed as a matter of law.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- and you mean people

25 are put out on the street when -- kicking and screaming

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 when they say, "No, I want to stay in jail. I don't

2 want to be" --

3 MR. LONG: Well, it's --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- "searched. I would

5 rather stay in jail"? And --

6 MR. LONG: Well --

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- they are dragged out --

8 MR. LONG: That --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- into the street. Is that

10 what happens?

11 MR. LONG: That is what the California

12 Supreme Court has said.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I --

14 MR. LONG: And what the statutes say is --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I don't think so.

16 MR. LONG: That -- the statutes say that

17 parole is a -- is a transitional period, and that every

18 inmate should undergo a period of parole.

19 But coming back to your earlier question, the

20 Court has said that the condition of a parolee is very

21 different from the condition of a prisoner. The Court

22 said that in Morrissey against Brewer. And the Court

23 said, in Griffin, as to probationers, that while the

24 Fourth Amendment rights of probationers -- and so,

25 parolees, too, we concede -- are reduced, there are --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the State can go too far. And if the State exceeds --

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but --

3 MR. LONG: -- the permissible limits, it's a

4 violation.

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- their condition is

6 very different, in a broad range of areas. They -- you

7 give up First Amendment rights. For example, it's

8 typical to have a condition of parole that you don't

9 consort with known criminals or gang members. You --

10 often it says you must refrain from alcohol. Sometimes

11 they say you can't go near particular places, if they

12 think that's going to tempt you to return to a life of

13 crime. Those are all First Amendment rights that are

14 sacrificed while you're on parole. Why is this any

15 different?

16 MR. LONG: Well, there are many rights that

17 are sacrificed. What the Court has said about the

18 Fourth Amendment rights is, because parolees have

19 conditional liberty, they will have a reduced, but not

20 eliminated, Fourth Amendment protection --

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about a drug --

22 what if you're convicted of a drug offense, you're on

23 parole, and one of the conditions is, every week you

24 have to go in for a drug test?

25 MR. LONG: Well, that --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you --

2 MR. LONG: -- that would be --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- do you -- is that

4 acceptable?

5 MR. LONG: That would be different in several

6 respects, Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, there would

7 not be discretion. You wouldn't have the individual

8 officer deciding --

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it would be a

10 Fourth Amendment right that you would be giving up --

11 MR. LONG: Yes. And --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that you would

13 otherwise have if you weren't on parole.

14 MR. LONG: And I want to be clear, we are not

15 -- we're arguing there is a broad spectrum of searches

16 that States can undertake of parolees, and I'm, by no

17 means, arguing today that all of them, or even most of

18 them, are unconstitutional. This is a --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: What would you say about a

20 condition that you must -- not a regular drug test --

21 you just have to submit yourself to a drug test

22 whenever a police officer asks you to?

23 MR. LONG: Well, you know, that would be much

24 narrower, because it would simply be a drug test. I

25 think it would have the problems of -- the officer

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 would have complete discretion. If it were like the

2 California --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's -- I

4 mean, the point --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think it would

6 valid? That's what I was asking you.

7 MR. LONG: I think, because that's a much

8 narrower test, that that could pass muster if -- but I

9 would think there really ought to be some guidance to

10 the officer. I think our ultimate submission today is

11 --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so that a --

13 MR. LONG: -- this is so --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- so that a burglar could

15 be searched for burglar tools --

16 MR. LONG: Well --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but not for drugs? And

18 the drug addict can be searched for drugs, and not

19 burglar tools?

20 MR. LONG: If it were -- if it were tied to

21 the crime that the parolee has committed, you know,

22 that would give it some limitation. This is a

23 completely unlimited search, for anything, any crime.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Justice Stevens's

25 question highlights the point that you criticize about:

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the randomness of it is often a critical element. I

2 suppose it makes much more sense to say you're subject

3 to a random drug test than that you have to come in at

4 a scheduled time, when you -- presumably, you could

5 refrain from using drugs prior to the test. And, to

6 some extent, it's the same, even if you're not talking

7 about a drug test.

8 MR. LONG: Well, in all --

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The search is only

10 going to be effective if it's not announced or --

11 MR. LONG: Well, in --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- scheduled.

13 MR. LONG: -- and in this Court's

14 suspicionless search cases, you can have a random test

15 where you draw names at random. There's some other

16 process that doesn't leave it up to each individual

17 officer to decide who gets the drug test or which car

18 to stop to check the driver's license and registration.

19 What the Court has consistently held is really at the

20 core of the Fourth Amendment is this notion of: the

21 individual officer in the field has complete discretion

22 to decide, "Do I search this person? Do I not? What's

23 the scope of the search? What do" --

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you relying --

25 MR. LONG: -- "I search for?"

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- on the difference

2 between -- you said "officer in the field." Would this

3 be okay if it had been his parole officer?

4 MR. LONG: Well, I think --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The parole officer was

6 walking along the street, saw this guy, and said, "I'm

7 going to search you."

8 MR. LONG: I think it's a very different set

9 of circumstances if we have a parole officer. This

10 Court has said, at least twice, in Griffin and in

11 Scott, that a parole officer has a different function.

12 They are not in an adversarial, or a purely

13 adversarial, relationship. They often think of the

14 parolee or the probationer as a client. They're trying

15 to see that the person succeeds. In some sense, the

16 parole officer fails when the parolee goes back to

17 prison. The parole -- the parole officer can act on

18 their entire knowledge and experience with the client,

19 or the parolee. So, all of that makes a difference.

20 And the Court has noted that several times.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: When he's in prison, is

22 there any problem about the prison guards intruding

23 upon his privacy, willy-nilly, whenever they choose?

24 MR. LONG: The -- as I understand the Court's

25 --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, walking --

2 MR. LONG: -- holding --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- by his cell, which is

4 always opened, and checking in on him to see what's --

5 what he's doing.

6 MR. LONG: As I understand the Court's

7 holding in Hudson against Palmer, the Fourth Amendment

8 does not apply in a prison cell. And --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, he's better off on

10 parole than -- well, at least no worse off on parole

11 than he would be when he was in prison.

12 MR. LONG: But, Your Honor, that's not the

13 way this Court has analyzed the Fourth Amendment

14 issues. It's a different situation. It is conditional

15 liberty. It's the -- that sort of active grace theory,

16 or right, privilege, distinction, or greater power

17 includes the lesser, all those arguments have been

18 rejected, in --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are --

20 MR. LONG: -- Morrissey against Brewer, and

21 Gagnon --

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: What --

23 MR. LONG: -- against Scarpelli.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not --

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- what do you make of --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- by me. No, please.

2 MR. LONG: It's --

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you make of the

4 pragmatic argument that seems to cut through all of your

5 objections? The pragmatic argument is both in favor

6 of complete discretion and of suspicionless search,

7 that the in terrorem effect of knowing that these

8 searches can occur at any moment, in fact, discourages

9 recidivism.

10 MR. LONG: Well --

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: What's your response to

12 that?

13 MR. LONG: -- I have a pragmatic argument,

14 and then I have an argument just based on the Fourth

15 Amendment. Pragmatically, no other State, as far as we

16 can tell, and not the Federal Government, authorizes

17 this kind of search; that is, blanket suspicionless

18 discretionary searches by police officers.

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Apart from --

20 MR. LONG: So --

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Apart from the lack of

22 popularity of the State's view --

23 MR. LONG: Well --

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- do we have -- do we have

25 any empirical evidence that bears on the in terrorem

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 argument?

2 MR. LONG: The -- well, the empirical

3 evidence is that all the other States don't seem to be

4 having a harder time --

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I --

6 MR. LONG: -- with recidivism.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- I realize that. But,

8 beyond that, do we have any empirical evidence, one way

9 or the other?

10 MR. LONG: Well, the California -- I think

11 that's a pretty powerful demonstration, but we do have,

12 beyond that, empirically, California was with all the

13 other States until the People against Reyes decision.

14 Now they've moved to suspicionless searches. They seem

15 to have about the same rate of recidivism --

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: I take it --

17 MR. LONG: -- as they --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the answer is --

19 MR. LONG: -- did before.

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- we don't have any

21 empirical evidence, one way or the other, apart from

22 the fact that California stands out in its system. Is

23 that correct?

24 MR. LONG: Well, I -- I'm -- think I'm

25 offering you evidence that counts as empirical in my

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 mind, but --

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I --

3 MR. LONG: -- apparently it's not --

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- I know it, but I've said,

5 about three times, that I want to get beyond the

6 peculiar position of California to any other empirical

7 evidence that cuts for you or against you. And I take

8 it there really isn't --

9 MR. LONG: Well, there -- we have a footnote.

10 There is a brief submitted by a Stanford law

11 professor, and we have at least a footnote in our

12 brief. There is some social science research that

13 suggests that this more intensive supervision is really

14 not effective, if you look at broad numbers. I mean, I

15 think you will catch some additional people. I mean,

16 it happened in this case. But if you step back and

17 look at the overall effects, it's not -- it's not

18 particularly helpful --

19 JUSTICE BREYER: Why --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: Why, if we're going to catch

22 some additional people, is that not sufficient? That

23 is, why is it unreasonable, say, not for law

24 professors, but business school professors, management

25 consultants, to say, "You have a lot of prisoners in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 California, hundreds of thousands -- I don't know,

2 maybe more than 100,000 -- and we'll tell the

3 Legislature that they can cut the terms, save money,

4 release them early, but we want to have management

5 checks. And the management checks are, you might be

6 searched at any time. And we catch a few. And that's

7 helpful." Now, if the --

8 MR. LONG: Well --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- State decides that,

10 what's unreasonable about it? "They're" --

11 MR. LONG: Well --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: -- "letting the people out

13 earlier than they otherwise would" --

14 MR. LONG: Because --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: -- says the Legislature.

16 MR. LONG: Because, Justice Breyer, it has to

17 be a balancing analysis, and --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: And what's on the other

19 side? The other side --

20 MR. LONG: Well --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: -- is, you'd rather not have

22 policemen search you, but your alternative is going to

23 be in jail.

24 MR. LONG: Well, I mean, the other side is a

25 search condition that says you have -- you could be

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 searched at any time, any place, by any police officer

2 for evidence of any crime, is a breathtakingly broad

3 invasion of privacy.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: But, of course, that's how

5 it happens when he's in prison.

6 MR. LONG: Well, but he has come out of

7 prison. The State has seen fit to release him on

8 parole into society. He has conditional liberty. And

9 the Court --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: But there is a

11 breathtakingly high probability that he is committing a

12 crime. The statistics cited in the Government's brief

13 say that in an April 2001 report prepared by the

14 California Criminal Justice Statistics Center, 68

15 percent of adult parolees are returned to prison -- 68

16 percent; 55 percent, for a parole violation; and 13

17 percent for the commission of a new felony offense. I

18 mean, it seems to me a breathtaking statistic like that

19 may call for breathtaking --

20 MR. LONG: Yes.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- measures to try to police

22 the matter closely.

23 MR. LONG: It is a very serious problem. We

24 don't want to minimize it. I mean, it is a fact that

25 many -- many parolees -- and this is true especially in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 California -- end up being returned for technical

2 violations, like not showing up to meetings with parole

3 officers. Some of the offenses are not as serious as

4 others. But it is a very serious problem. We

5 recognize that. But what the Court has said is that

6 the gravity of the problem cannot justify any means.

7 There has to be a balancing of the invasion of privacy

8 against the State's need to undertake this.

9 And coming back to my second answer to the

10 question you asked several minutes ago, Justice Scalia,

11 I mean, ultimately this search is a -- it's a general

12 warrant. It's a writ of assistance. It's limited to

13 parolees, but if the Court is going to stand by what it

14 has said in Griffin and other cases, that their

15 parolees and probationers have some modicum of Fourth

16 Amendment rights -- reduced, we recognize that -- this

17 is -- this is the core of what the --

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the --

19 MR. LONG: -- framers of --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- California --

21 MR. LONG: -- the Fourth Amendment

22 prohibited.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The California

24 Supreme Court said that the Fourth Amendment applied to

25 these searches, but it only protected in a limited way,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 along the same lines as we said in Griffin. And the

2 standard they applied was, it protected against

3 arbitrary or harassing or capricious searches --

4 MR. LONG: Yes, but --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- which seems to go

6 to your argument, which is centered around the

7 unbridled discretion of the officer. And the

8 California Supreme Court is saying it's not unbridled.

9 MR. LONG: That is their answer to my

10 argument, and I want to be very clear about "arbitrary,

11 capricious, and harassing." That's the California

12 Supreme Court's standard. So, of course, they get to

13 define it. And they have not defined it the way this

14 Court perhaps would define "arbitrary." It's not

15 arbitrary, capricious, or harassing if it has a

16 permissible law enforcement purpose. So, as long as

17 the officer says, "Well, I don't have any reason to

18 think there's evidence of any crime here, but that's

19 what I'm looking for. Perhaps there's evidence of

20 crime" --

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's --

22 MR. LONG: -- that's enough.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- fine. But it

24 turns out he stops the guy every hour of the day, then

25 he has a pretty strong case that this is for

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 harassment, and it's not --

2 MR. LONG: Well --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- for the special

4 law enforcement --

5 MR. LONG: Well, and --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- need that

7 accompanies releasing parolees.

8 MR. LONG: And I take it the Fourth Amendment

9 itself would prohibit that sort of thing. But it --

10 you couldn't -- you couldn't justify a general warrant

11 by saying, "Well, yes, the officer can search anybody,

12 without any suspicion, and he can choose." But it --

13 you know, the search can't happen too often, or it

14 can't last too long. That would not be -- and you --

15 and you -- similarly, it would not be an answer to say,

16 "Well, as long as he's looking for evidence of crime."

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but your point

18 was that this is the core of the Fourth Amendment, and

19 they're taking away all of the protection and leaving

20 it to the unbridled discretion. And that turns out to

21 be not the case. Under the law that authorizes the

22 procedure, the California Supreme Court interpretation

23 is that the Fourth Amendment provides protection

24 against harassment or arbitrary and --

25 MR. LONG: Well --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- capricious

2 searches.

3 MR. LONG: -- I mean, my argument is that

4 what is left of the Fourth Amendment under the

5 California approach is not the core. It's the far

6 periphery. There has never been a case -- and we were

7 able to find over a hundred, and perhaps over 200; it

8 depends on how you count -- of cases where parolees or

9 probationers have said, "You know, this search was

10 arbitrary or capricious or harassing." It is always

11 rejected, for the same reason it was in this case. The

12 Court says, "Well" --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then which way do you

14 think that cuts? There's --

15 MR. LONG: It --

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- never been a case

17 of a harassing search of a parolee.

18 MR. LONG: I --

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, that's what -

20 - or 200 cases in the --

21 MR. LONG: I --

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in --

23 MR. LONG: -- I think it cuts in the

24 direction that it is an empty, vacuous standard. It's

25 a standard --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why?

2 MR. LONG: -- that's always --

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? If it -- if it -- if

4 it -- it doesn't go to the suspicionless character of

5 the search, but it does say it has to be reasonable in

6 time, place, or manner.

7 MR. LONG: Yes.

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And maybe the --

9 MR. LONG: Yes.

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- officers are reasonable

11 in time, place --

12 MR. LONG: Yes.

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- or manner.

14 MR. LONG: And -- but it's -- it had -- there

15 has never been a case in which a court has rejected a

16 parolee search as unreasonable in time, place, or

17 manner. And you could --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many times has it been

19 challenged --

20 MR. LONG: As --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- on the --

22 MR. LONG: -- we said -- we found over a hundred

23 cases in which it's been challenged in the California

24 courts. And it --

25 JUSTICE ALITO: Well --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. LONG: I mean, if you think about it, if

2 the search is, say, at night, the argument is going to

3 be -- well, if we said we'd not -- "never going to

4 search you at night," then you would commit crimes at

5 night. We had a very extreme case in our brief about

6 body-cavity searches. And they said, "Well, that -- of

7 course, that" -- you know, the suggestion was, "Of

8 course, that would be too extreme." But you could see

9 an argument if parolees and probationers knew that that

10 was off limits, that -- you know, that would become a -

11 -

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: You say there was a case in

13 which, without any special reason, they did --

14 MR. LONG: No. Let --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- a cavity search --

16 MR. LONG: No, let me be -- I am not aware of

17 any actual case. We posited that. We said -- you know,

18 because you don't need to know anything about the parolee,

19 except he's on parole, and you can search for evidence

20 of any crime. You don't need any suspicion that -- so, you

21 could have somebody, a sort of white-collar criminal,

22 or you'd check someone who's written a bad check. And

23 if you say, "Well, I think perhaps you're involved in

24 drugs. Maybe you're one of these balloon-swallowers" -

25 - you don't need any actual reason to think that's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 happening, you can simply say, "I want to investigate

2 that." And the way -- you have to investigate that by x

3 rays or something else quite intrusive.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: The California Supreme Court

5 may -- might well hold that it's arbitrary to conduct

6 such an extreme search as a body-cavity search, or to -

7 - I don't know --

8 MR. LONG: Well --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to decide to search the

10 person when he's in the men's room or something. I

11 mean, there are --

12 MR. LONG: But --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- there are a lot of

14 limitations that the California court --

15 MR. LONG: They might, and --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- could put on it, within

17 the context of harassment or --

18 MR. LONG: But our principal submission,

19 Justice Scalia -- I mean, if California said, "We have

20 a terrible problem with crime in California; and,

21 therefore, we're authorizing every police officer to

22 search every person anytime, anywhere, for any crime,"

23 that would be, I would submit, the clearest sort of

24 Fourth Amendment violation you could imagine. It would

25 be a general warrant or a writ of assistance. It

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 couldn't possibly be justified by saying, "Well, if it

2 gets too extreme, if it gets into body-cavity searches,

3 we won't allow it." We are talking about parolees,

4 yes. Their Fourth Amendment rights are reduced, yes.

5 We recognize that. But saying that this sort of

6 absolutely unguided discretion --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: But the reason ---

8 MR. LONG: -- there's no sort of --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- the reason that people, I

10 think, are saying that is because they have a lot of

11 prisoners, they're trying to create a category of

12 people who don't have to stay in prison, where they

13 have no rights. And the real question is, can

14 California, in trying to create this interim category,

15 reduce the Fourth Amendment right in the way you

16 describe?

17 MR. LONG: They --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: Of course they can't do it,

19 but the justification is not that there is something

20 bad about this particular individual or he's in some

21 kind of limbo. The reason is that there's a policy

22 tending towards release, which California has decided

23 they want to introduce this as a condition. Now --

24 MR. LONG: Yes.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and so, what -- and the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 question is, what's unreasonable about that?

2 MR. LONG: Well, what's unreasonable about it

3 is that it goes so far in the direction of eliminating

4 the Fourth Amendment rights of people who are not

5 prisoners -- they are -- they have conditional liberty

6 -- that it is simply not consistent with the Fourth

7 Amendment. And on the empirical side, California is an

8 outlier. All the other States --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I -- may I ask you --

10 MR. LONG: -- and the Federal Government --

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question? Part of

12 your appeal of your case is, you talk about the

13 corporate offender or tax dodger, something like that.

14 It seems quite unreasonable, I agree with you. But

15 what if you defined the class much more narrowly and

16 limit it to people who have been convicted of violent

17 crimes of a very serious nature and so forth, and said,

18 as to those, they can have a totally suspicionless

19 search? Would that --

20 MR. LONG: Well --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- be permissible?

22 MR. LONG: -- I -- one of the things we

23 wanted to make -- I think there are many things that

24 States can do. They could certainly --

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I wonder whether --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. LONG: -- there's the possibility of --

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- whether you think they

3 could do that.

4 MR. LONG: There's the possibility of

5 individual determinations, based on the individual

6 circumstances. If you went --

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what I'm --

8 MR. LONG: -- category by --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: I wanted to see if there is a

10 way that the class could be defined narrowly, because I

11 want to ask the other side if they would allow the

12 search for any ex-felon, for example. You could divide

13 it in a way that seemed obviously too broad. But is --

14 MR. LONG: Right.

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- there a narrower class -

16 -

17 MR. LONG: Well --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- that you think would be

19 acceptable?

20 MR. LONG: I think this could be much

21 narrower. And, in my view, it would become a much

22 closer constitutional question if it were limited to

23 certain crimes where the legislature or the State made

24 a finding that there's a particular need to have --

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Say you were a --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. LONG: -- suspicionless --

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- terrorist, for example.

3 MR. LONG: And --

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's just limited to

5 terrorists, convicted terrorists.

6 MR. LONG: Yes, perhaps convicted terrorists.

7 You know, that -- and it -- that's very different from

8 what we have here, because --

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about drug offenders,

10 given the high rate of recidivism?

11 MR. LONG: Well, I -- you know, we -- I think

12 you would have to see the facts of that case, but if

13 they made a finding that, "Because of the nature of

14 drug offenses, we need suspicionless searches rather

15 than simply reasonable suspicion, and we need police

16 officers, not parole officers" -- and there could be

17 other regulations. The Federal regulations, we think,

18 are a model, really. They have lots of limitations on

19 --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Long, is it -- is it

21 fair to compare California to other States? The

22 assumption would have to be that other States grant

23 parole as liberally as California does. Maybe

24 California has made the decision, "We have too many

25 people in prison. We're going to let a lot of them

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 out, but we're going to keep them on a very tight

2 leash." Why shouldn't it be able to do that? To

3 have tighter controls, but let out many more people on

4 parole, which is -- which is exactly what I think

5 they're doing.

6 MR. LONG: Well, and I -- I think they can

7 have tighter controls, Your Honor. They can -- they

8 can have -- they could have -- they could make this a

9 special condition of parole --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: But my only --

11 MR. LONG: -- rather than a general condition

12 --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- point is --

14 MR. LONG: -- of parole.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the fact that other

16 States aren't as tight doesn't prove anything, because

17 other States --

18 MR. LONG: Well --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- may not be --

20 MR. LONG: Well --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- be trying to do the same

22 thing --

23 MR. LONG: I mean --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to empty their prisons --

25 MR. LONG: This Court has said, generally,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that what the Court has found to be reasonable for one

2 State is reasonable for all. And when a practice is

3 not well established -- and here, it's far from well

4 established; California's virtually unique -- the Court

5 has taken that into account for --

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose you were in a

7 halfway house, and the State says, "We're creating a

8 status. One is, you're a prisoner. Another is, you're

9 a halfway house. Another is, on your -- parole. But

10 we want to subject you to suspicionless searches at --

11 in all three stages -- prison, halfway house, parole."

12 Could they do it for the halfway house?

13 MR. LONG: Well, they might -- halfway

14 houses, as I understand it, Justice Ginsburg, are

15 largely now a thing of the past. But if the idea is

16 you would actually be in a custody situation at night,

17 perhaps in lockdown, then perhaps Hudson against Palmer

18 would come into play --

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This person goes --

20 MR. LONG: -- which --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- out to work, comes back

22 at the end of the day, and is checked in.

23 MR. LONG: And so, your hypothetical is,

24 could there be suspicionless searches by --

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, while the --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. LONG: -- police officers --

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- while the --

3 MR. LONG: -- at work?

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The person who is in this

5 semi-custody state, he's going to work, and, while he's

6 at his workplace, the police officer shows up and says,

7 "I'm going to pat you down, and then I'm going to" --

8 MR. LONG: It's --

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- "see if you have

10 drugs."

11 MR. LONG: It's a -- it's a harder case.

12 Again, our bottom line is, there would need to be some

13 limitations on that individual officer's discretion.

14 That's the core of the Fourth Amendment.

15 If there are no further questions, I'd like

16 to reserve the balance of my time.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Long.

18 Mr. Niver, we'll hear now from you.

19 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD E. NIVER

20 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

21 MR. NIVER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it --

22 may it please the Court:

23 Alarmed by the State rate of recidivism and

24 revocation of the more than 100,000 parolees,

25 California enacted a statute which authorized the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 search of a parolee based solely on his status as a

2 parolee. We submit that such a search is reasonable

3 under the Fourth Amendment.

4 As this Court held recently in United States

5 versus Knights, to determine the validity of the search

6 we balance the State's need to search against the

7 privacy interest affected. Here, the need is

8 overwhelming, and the privacy interest is dramatically

9 reduced.

10 Turning first to Petitioner's expectation of

11 privacy, it is greatly diminished. Even if it exists,

12 it is far less than that enjoyed by the average law-

13 abiding citizen. No one outside the confines of a

14 prison has a lesser expectation of privacy than a

15 parolee.

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? Doesn't

17 that kind of beg the question? I mean, if we say he's

18 got the normal Fourth Amendment rights, his -- I mean,

19 the expectation-of-privacy analysis seems to me to be

20 totally circular.

21 MR. NIVER: That's what the --

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say he doesn't

23 have an expectation of privacy, so it's not protected.

24 Well, if we say he does have a -- if we say it is

25 protected, then he does have an expectation of privacy.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. NIVER: Well, this Court spoke to that in

2 Knights and said, unanimously that the -- in Knights,

3 it was a probation condition, but I think that it --

4 obviously, the same analysis applies here -- that the

5 imposition or acceptance of a -- of a search condition

6 by a parolee or a probationer results in the severely

7 diminished expectation of privacy enjoyed by the

8 parolee or probationer. And this Court said that

9 unanimously in Knights.

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Knights

11 involved a situation where reasonable suspicion was

12 required, so it addressed the problem that Mr. Long has

13 of unbridled discretion. You still had to have an

14 articulable reasonable suspicion with respect to the

15 individual.

16 MR. NIVER: That is true, Your Honor, but the

17 threshold question was whether he had an expectation of

18 privacy at all, or to the -- the extent of that

19 expectation of privacy. And the Court, in Knights,

20 before it discussed the balance, had to identify the

21 factors in the balance. In terms of the probationer's

22 interest in that case, by virtue of the search

23 condition, this Court said that his interest in -- his

24 expectation of privacy was severely diminished, and

25 left open specific --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- and why was

2 his expectation of privacy severely diminished?

3 MR. NIVER: Because of the parole's -- excuse

4 me -- the probation search that was imposed upon him by

5 virtue of the --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because of the very

7 practice that's being challenged here today, right?

8 MR. NIVER: Well, yes.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because he saw

10 something -- you -- he signed something that said,

11 "You're subject to searches." Well, that's what is at

12 issue. It seems to me that it's -- I guess I've said

13 it before, he's -- it's begging the question to say,

14 "You can do this, because he has a diminished

15 expectation of privacy." How far do you push this?

16 Can you have parolees come in and take a lie-detector

17 test every week? Do they have -- do they have

18 diminished expectation with respect to their Fifth

19 Amendment rights?

20 MR. NIVER: With regard to the Fifth

21 Amendment rights, if they are not in custody, then --

22 or even if they are -- I don't think that that would

23 necessarily -- the -- any expectation of privacy would

24 preclude the imposition of a lie-detector test, no.

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was that a yes, you

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 can have them --

2 MR. NIVER: Yes, Your Honor.

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can.

4 MR. NIVER: Yes. But in this case, the --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about --

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is --

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that right? I mean, even

10 in prison, I -- what -- I'm not sure you could even do

11 that if they were still in prison. Can you subject

12 people in prison --

13 MR. NIVER: Well, of course, that would not

14 be a Fourth Amendment claim.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. No, I --

16 MR. NIVER: It would be a different --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Chief Justice was trying

18 to get out of the Fourth Amendment into the Fifth.

19 MR. NIVER: That failing -- well, in terms of

20 the lack of a precedent from this Court, you know, at

21 this point we can only speculate, but it seems to me

22 that if a person can be required to submit to a drug

23 test by virtue of the status as a parolee or

24 probationer, I don't think that it is an extravagant

25 step to say that they could be required to submit to an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 interview.

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you say the same

3 thing if the offense he had committed was tax evasion

4 or price-fixing or speeding? Would the -- would a

5 person on parole for any one of those offenses have --

6 be subject to the same risk of a suspicionless search?

7 And would it be justified?

8 MR. NIVER: Suspicionless search?

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well --

10 MR. NIVER: Where we're back to --

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- applying this statute to

12 --

13 MR. NIVER: Yes.

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- a price-fixer, tax-

15 evader, speeder. Do you think it's justified?

16 MR. NIVER: If he's on parole, Your Honor, if

17 he's -- look, this applies to parolees in California

18 who have been convicted of felonies, served time in

19 prison, and have been --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: And if it's to be --

21 MR. NIVER: -- released on parole.

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- applied to the tax

23 offender and so forth, how about just applying it to

24 all ex-felons? Would that be permissible?

25 MR. NIVER: On parole, or not on --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, just the very fact that

2 there's -- they're an ex-felon. And let the person

3 know, at the time of his discharge from prison, that

4 this is one of the things that the State is going to

5 exact from you as a punishment for your crime.

6 MR. NIVER: If the person is on parole, the

7 answer --

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm saying --

9 MR. NIVER: Oh --

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- he's not on parole.

11 MR. NIVER: -- he's no longer on parole?

12 Than the entire balance changes. The reduction of the

13 expectation of privacy --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm hypothesizing a

15 case in which the law will destroy the expectation of

16 privacy, because it will provide that all ex-felons are

17 subject to search. So, they would know, the same as a

18 parolee now knows, he's subject to search. Would that

19 be valid?

20 MR. NIVER: My answer to that is, it would

21 not be valid, Your Honor, because a person, having

22 served his time on parole, the State's overwhelming

23 interest in supervision has ended. The State has

24 determined that that person, having successfully

25 completed his period of parole --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- so you don't --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Most --

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- rely on --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Most States --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- the fact that --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- don't let felons vote. I

7 mean, that's a punishment that they impose after

8 they're out of prison.

9 MR. NIVER: Yes, but this is not -- yes, Your

10 Honor, but this is really not about punishment, this is

11 about supervision. And if a parolee has successfully

12 completed this parole, has been discharged from parole,

13 then the balance --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: But then we're not relying

15 on the elimination of the expectation of privacy,

16 because, under my hypothetical statute, the ex-felon

17 would know he's subject to it. So, it has to be

18 something other than the absence of an expectation of

19 privacy. Is that correct?

20 MR. NIVER: Not -- a person who is no longer

21 on parole, there is no longer the overwhelming State

22 interest in supervision. The balance changes. Our

23 position would be that that would not be a permissible

24 search.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me that the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 principal difference, Mr. Niver, is that when he's on

2 parole, it's in lieu of being in jail. If that's not

3 the difference, you don't persuade me. He has

4 voluntarily accepted the parole in exchange for his

5 getting out of jail. And he'd be in worse condition if

6 he were in jail. That's what, seems to me, makes the

7 difference.

8 MR. NIVER: Well, that's -- I think that's

9 exactly right, Your Honor. The ex-parolee, no longer

10 on parole, is no longer in custody of the -- of the

11 California Department of Corrections. There is no

12 longer an overwhelming need to supervise the person,

13 who, having successfully completed parole, is

14 presumptively not the threat to society that he was

15 that he -- when he was a parolee. The balance changes,

16 and such a condition -- that is to say a suspicionless

17 search of an ex-parolee, I think would offend the

18 Fourth Amendment.

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Niver --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: But what do you achieve by

21 this system that you have that you couldn't achieve by

22 a system that more carefully worked out the rules and

23 conditions of a random search? I mean, rules, so that

24 you avoid the totally discretionary element. And if

25 you want to have management consultants, as I was

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 imagining, have 'em. They're not just going to tell

2 you, "Go and ask anybody to search anytime he wants."

3 They'll have a system worked out. So, why not at least

4 require you to think it through that much? And,

5 otherwise, it is unreasonable.

6 MR. NIVER: Well, we have disputed

7 Petitioner's position that this is a search, although

8 suspicionless, that it is -- that discretion is not

9 circumscribed is our position. And it is, because --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, are there manuals --

11 are there any -- here is the cop on the beat.

12 MR. NIVER: Yes.

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He sees someone that he

14 knows is a parolee. Is there any instruction that he's

15 been given so that his discretion can be guided instead

16 of rudderless? In practice in California, are all --

17 MR. NIVER: In -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. What is the

19 practice?

20 MR. NIVER: In practice, the -- a search -- a

21 parole search may not be arbitrary, capricious, or

22 conducted solely for the purpose of harassing --

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking you about what

24 instruction, what training, if you know, are officers

25 given? Or are they given no training, just the law

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that says, "You can search any parolee"?

2 MR. NIVER: No, they are not told that they

3 may search any parolee, Your Honor. Rather, they are

4 told that the search must be to rehabilitate, reform,

5 or have some other law enforcement purpose. And they -

6-

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. The officer says,

8 "I'm searching to see whether the person has any

9 evidence of crime on him." For example, whether he has

10 any drugs on him. Law enforcement purpose:

11 supervisory, I suppose. They want to know whether

12 their -- whether their parolees are committing

13 offenses. And yet, that reason would apply to everyone

14 virtually all the time. So, it doesn't seem to be a

15 limitation at all. What -- am I -- am I missing

16 something?

17 MR. NIVER: It does apply -- it is a

18 limitation. It is not a limitation that would protect

19 the expectation of privacy of a nonparole --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how does the

21 limitation work? The guy is on 1st Street, and an

22 officer says, you know, "I recognize this person is a

23 parolee, and I have a law enforcement objective. Is

24 the person committing a crime? Is the -- is the person

25 a recidivist? Is the person violating parole?" So, he

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 searches him. The person gets to 2nd Street, another

2 officer does the same thing. Three hours later, a

3 third officer does the same thing. In each case, it

4 seems to me, their justification would not fall afoul

5 of the arbitrary, capricious, or harassment standard.

6 It's not coordinated. They have a -- both a parole

7 and a law enforcement objective. Why is there any

8 limitation, then, on the right to search?

9 MR. NIVER: If these are, as I understand

10 Your Honor's hypothetical, three independent searches -

11 -

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Uh-huh.

13 MR. NIVER: -- to the extent that that could

14 happen, and I suppose it could, the -- again, the

15 limitation is it be, as Your Honor states, for a

16 valid law enforcement purpose, and it would require --

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: No. No, but let's get

18 behind the rhetoric. Is there any reason my

19 hypothetical could not, in fact, turn out to be true?

20 MR. NIVER: There is no --

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Apart from the unlikelihood

22 of all those police officers out there. But, leaving

23 that aside, is there -- is there any reason, in the

24 standard, that my hypothetical could not be true?

25 MR. NIVER: Well, Your Honor, no, there is no

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 reason, but it would -- it requires more than testimony

2 by the officers. If the officers at -- each testified

3 that they conducted the search, they're -- also

4 requires a finding of fact by the trial court that the

5 searches were, in fact, for a valid law enforcement

6 purpose.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. I mean, let's assume

8 the police are telling the truth, and the judge says,

9 "Sure." So, there is no limitation. And it sounds to

10 me, then, as though about the only limitation that

11 would be enforceable would be the limitation against

12 harassment. If one officer did it every 15 minutes to

13 the same person, or if there were a departmental

14 systematic policy saying, you know, "Get so-and-so,"

15 that I can understand as being a limitation. But I

16 don't see any other limit.

17 MR. NIVER: Well, the limitation is, as Your

18 Honor states, if it's a -- for a valid law enforcement

19 purpose or to promote rehabilitation or --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I realize --

21 MR. NIVER: -- recommend --

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- but do you --

23 MR. NIVER: But --

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- do you agree that there

25 is not any practical limitation, other than the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 harassment limitation?

2 MR. NIVER: I -- well, that harassment

3 limitation is sufficient to protect the residuum of an

4 expectation --

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe --

6 MR. NIVER: -- of --

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- maybe it is. But what's

8 the answer to my question? Is that, in practical

9 terms, the only limitation?

10 MR. NIVER: It is a -- but it -- yes, Your

11 Honor, that is the protection.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said that

14 maybe cavity searches would not -- would not be allowed

15 without some special reason for them. And that

16 wouldn't necessarily be harassment.

17 MR. NIVER: I think it depends on the

18 circumstances of the search.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes --

20 MR. NIVER: There's an --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean --

22 MR. NIVER: -- overarching principle here,

23 under the Fourth Amendment, that the search be

24 reasonable, in terms of manner and scope.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. NIVER: That applies equally to a

2 suspicionless search as it would to a search based on

3 individual suspicion. To that extent, it's really not

4 an issue that arises from the fact that this is

5 suspicionless.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would be arbitrary

7 and capricious? You told us harassing would be the

8 repeated searches by the same officer.

9 MR. NIVER: Or an -- or a needlessly intrusive

10 search, as has been just described, or --

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's assume -- let's

12 assume that the cavity search is demanded at the bus

13 station, and the officer says, "We know that drugs get

14 transported by people who ingest them in the balloons,

15 and they get on buses and they travel back and forth

16 from city A to city B." Any reason that that would run

17 afoul of arbitrary and capricious?

18 MR. NIVER: Depends on the circumstances of

19 the search. Again, Your Honor --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: All I'm telling you is, he's

21 at a bus station. The facts are that a lot of people

22 who travel on buses are drug couriers. This person is

23 a parolee. Would that run afoul of the -- of any

24 arbitrary and capricious limitation?

25 MR. NIVER: It would, for example, if it were

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 done in public view. If the officer didn't, then --

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, sure, but the officer

3 says, "All right. I'm taking you down to the station

4 for a cavity search."

5 MR. NIVER: Again, the office -- if the

6 officer did it under those circumstances, it's for the

7 finder of fact to decide whether it was done for a

8 legitimate purpose or --

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you're -- I'm asking

10 you to be the finder of fact for me. This is the

11 officer's explanation. This is the factual -- set of

12 factual premises on which he acts. Has he violated the

13 arbitrary and capricious limitation?

14 MR. NIVER: If, in fact, it was for the

15 purpose that you state, a legitimate law enforcement

16 purpose, and he has been removed from public view, and

17 it's reasonable, in terms of manner and intensity, then

18 it would be permissible.

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, suppose you couldn't -

21 -

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you couldn't --

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- conduct cavity searches

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 without some special reason, even in prison. Wouldn't

2 that be -- isn't there some remnant of a fourth-

3 amendment right in prison that you cannot subject, you

4 know, the whole cellblock to cavity searches?

5 MR. NIVER: That would depend, Your Honor, on

6 the prison, the prison regs, the State. I can't answer

7 that question --

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I --

9 MR. NIVER: -- in --

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- I thought the assumption

11 of your answer to my question a moment ago was that

12 there was no such limitation, so far as California is

13 concerned.

14 MR. NIVER: No, there is a limitation, in

15 terms of manner and scope.

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, sure. But we -- the

17 manner, in this case, is, they take him down to the

18 station, so that they're not going through this in the

19 middle of a crowded bus terminal. But the point of the

20 question was, any parolee at a bus terminal could be

21 subjected to this demand for search, and I thought your

22 answer was, yes, he could be. And now, in response to

23 Justice Scalia's question, you're saying, "Well, there

24 may be some limitation." So, which is it?

25 MR. NIVER: That if the search is a -- for a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 valid law enforcement purpose, and it is reasonable in

2 scope and manner, then it is a permissible parolee

3 search, in California.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it depend -- I

5 mean, what if he's on parole for transporting drugs in

6 balloons from bus stations? Does that make a

7 difference? -- as opposed to, he's on parole for tax

8 fraud.

9 MR. NIVER: It certainly might, Your Honor.

10 And, again, that would be -- that -- an additional bit

11 of evidence to present -- to be presented to the

12 suppression court to determine whether the scope of the

13 search was reasonable.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But all this is on a case

15 -- would be on a case-by-case basis. There are no

16 going-in guides for the officer on the street.

17 MR. NIVER: It's necessarily determined on

18 the -- any search has to be decided -- the

19 reasonableness of any search has to be decided on a

20 case-by-case basis.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: But the reasonableness here

23 would be unreasonable, unless there are some checks.

24 We're talking about suspicionless searches. And you

25 could have checks. But what about saying -- why is it

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 reasonable to do it without any rule-based controls on

2 the behavior of the police? That's the question.

3 MR. NIVER: Okay. And the answer is, in

4 terms of the competing interests, the lowered

5 expectations --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. But what interest

7 does it serve not to have some rules, manuals,

8 regulations that help make sure it really is random, or

9 help make sure it isn't harassing, or help make sure

10 that it's serving the very ends that you hope to serve

11 with the suspicionless searches?

12 MR. NIVER: If a State wishes to adopt such

13 rules, those would -- may comply with the Fourth

14 Amendment. The question is not, what could be done?

15 The question is, What was done? The question is

16 whether California's rule, which permits parolee

17 searches that -- with the -- absolute prohibition of

18 arbitrary, capricious, and harassing suits, and which

19 must be conducted under the Fourth Amendment, in terms

20 -- reasonable, in terms of time, place, manner, and

21 scope -- the question is whether that system, the

22 California scheme, is constitutional under the Fourth

23 Amendment. And here, the system was designed to

24 address an overwhelming problem that the Court, this

25 Court, has well defined. The -- over 100,000 parolees

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 are on the street at any given time. Almost 90,000 of

2 them will be revoked in any given period. They -- the

3 California parolees require intense supervision. The

4 statute, 3067, was enacted to permit that kind of

5 intense supervision. And the protection afforded to

6 the parolee, in terms of a requirement of a proper

7 purpose --

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Niver.

9 Mr. Marcus.

10 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN L. MARCUS

11 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

12 IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT

13 MR. MARCUS: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,

14 and may it please the Court:

15 Concerned about the threat that parolees pose

16 to public safety, the California Legislature, in 1996,

17 authorized both police and parole officers to search

18 them without individualized suspicion. Whether

19 evaluated under the special-needs doctrine applied in

20 Griffin, or the totality-of-the-circumstances approach

21 applied in Knights, the search of Petitioner in this

22 case, pursuant to his search condition, was reasonable

23 under the Fourth Amendment.

24 JUSTICE ALITO: Do we have --

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But not the consent --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to decide --

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- not the consent

3 approach, I take it. I didn't get an opportunity to

4 ask the counsel who argued just previously. Seemed to

5 me that he argued consent when he answered Justice

6 Stevens's question about the tax-evader. But he argued

7 the overwhelming practical needs when he argued the

8 rest of the case. And I thought I saw some tension in

9 the argument there. And I take it the Government does

10 not embrace the consent argument?

11 MR. MARCUS: No, we do embrace it. We -- but

12 we briefed --

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you --

14 MR. MARCUS: -- the --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- just --

16 MR. MARCUS: It --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- put it in number --

18 MR. MARCUS: We --

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you put it --

20 MR. MARCUS: We --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in number three?

22 MR. MARCUS: Right. It --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In --

24 MR. MARCUS: -- well, primarily -- for a

25 couple of reasons. First, Your Honor, the California

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Supreme Court has not had a chance to interpret

2 3067(a), you know, after the Reyes decision. They

3 weren't interpreting it there. And so, they haven't

4 had a chance to revisit their ruling that, as a matter

5 of State law, it's not -- there's no consent when it

6 comes to a parolee. And that's -- so, we thought maybe

7 that would be a reason this Court, prudentially,

8 wouldn't want to reach that issue.

9 And, secondly, the -- while the joint

10 appendix contains a portion of the agreement that the

11 Petitioner signed, it doesn't contain the whole content

12 of the agreement. The appellate record doesn't contain

13 the whole content of the agreement. So, we didn't --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in your view, if the

15 consent was straightforward in the documents, would

16 that be the strongest argument or the weakest argument?

17 MR. MARCUS: Well, I think --

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I take you'll win

19 on any --

20 MR. MARCUS: We --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- argument --

22 MR. MARCUS: Right, we think all --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you can take.

24 MR. MARCUS: -- we think all three arguments

25 are strong. I don't think -- one isn't necessarily

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 stronger than the other. And -- but -- and this Court

2 -- but if the Court -- I mean, the Court certainly, at

3 a minimum, can look at the statutes under California

4 law, and can certainly conclude from the statutes that

5 if a -- if some -- if an inmate doesn't sign the

6 papers, he stays in prison until his sentence basically

7 terminates. And then -- and then, at that point, when

8 he's released, this -- another provision, section

9 3060.5, kicks in, and his parole -- his parole is

10 revoked. And he eventually will -- he ultimately will

11 serve his whole term of parole in prison, so that the

12 Court can see by the statutes that it is, effectively,

13 a choice, statutorily, that he -- someone who does not

14 want to be on parole does not have -- does not have to

15 sign the condition, and will never go on parole.

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Long seemed to have --

17 tell us something different about that. It's -- they

18 had -- they must go out. He seemed to say they didn't

19 have the choice of staying in.

20 MR. MARCUS: Well, I think it's fairly clear,

21 Your Honor, under -- if you look at the appendix to the

22 Petitioner's brief, if you -- if you look at a

23 combination of section 3067(b), and then -- which --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think he said he was

25 unaware of anybody who was dragged out kicking and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

56
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 screaming.

2 MR. MARCUS: Right. And then if you look at

3 3067(b), and then you also look at -- 3067(a) and (b),

4 and then you look at section 3060.5, which provides for

5 revocation if the -- if the inmate is -- or the parolee

6 is unwilling to --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it really --

8 MR. MARCUS: -- sign the --

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- it really isn't.

10 MR. MARCUS: -- agreement.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's -- this is not like

12 you sign an agreement and you're -- you can do it or

13 you can not do it. I mean, this is a real Hobson's

14 choice, isn't it?

15 MR. MARCUS: Well, you know, again, if you

16 think that --

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can't --

18 MR. MARCUS: -- there --

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- negotiate, "I don't" --

20 MR. MARCUS: There --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- "want this part."

22 MR. MARCUS: There undoubtedly are adverse

23 consequences to not signing the agreement.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you --

25 MR. MARCUS: But --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

57

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- waive your --

2 could you waive --

3 MR. MARCUS: But --

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- your Eighth

5 Amendment rights? You know, if your parole's revoked,

6 you're going to go back into a very cruel and unusual

7 prison, not the one you left.

8 MR. MARCUS: Well, I mean, I think -- I think

9 the test would be whether it's -- whether it's

10 reasonably the consent -- what they're asking you to

11 agree to is reasonably related to the purposes of

12 punishment. And, in this case, the -- you know, the

13 supervision of the parolee, rehabilitation, protection

14 of public safety. And so, we think the consent

15 argument works very well here.

16 But, if I could, I'd like to also address our

17 arguments under the totality of the circumstances and

18 special needs. Faced with a serious recidivism

19 problem, California has made the reasonable judgment

20 that subjecting parolees to suspicionless searches is

21 necessary to protect public safety and to promote

22 rehabilitation.

23 JUSTICE ALITO: What if it's the case --

24 MR. MARCUS: But --

25 JUSTICE ALITO: -- that this program would

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

58
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 allow some searches that are -- that violate the Fourth

2 Amendment, but that this particular search would not?

3 How closely can we focus just on what happened here, or

4 do we have to consider all the -- all the types of

5 searches and the circumstances of searches that the

6 California program might permit?

7 MR. MARCUS: Well, I -- no, I mean, I think

8 typically this Court applies a very, sort of, narrowly

9 tailored approach to Fourth Amendment questions, and

10 focuses narrowly on the context in which the search was

11 conducted. In this case, for example, you wouldn't --

12 you wouldn't have to reach the question of whether a

13 search of a home was constitutional. This -- I mean,

14 the question here is whether a search of the Petitioner

15 on a public street was constitutional. And the Court

16 does typically limit its Fourth Amendment cases to the

17 facts presented.

18 So -- but, at the same time, in analyzing

19 that, I think you do have to consider what the Fourth

20 Amendment standard is. And we believe the Fourth

21 Amendment does impose -- the Fourth Amendment itself

22 imposes restrictions on the discretion of police

23 officers and parole officers that are meaningful, that

24 -- as the Reyes Court said, there are restrictions on

25 the timing, the frequency, the duration, and the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1 oppressiveness of the search. So, police officers and

2 parole officers are on notice that courts will review

3 suspicionless searches very carefully. They're on

4 notice that there are limits to what they can do. And

5 they're --

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: But following --

7 MR. MARCUS: -- on notice that --

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- up on Justice --

9 MR. MARCUS: -- if a search is --

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- Alito's thought,

11 supposing there were no restrictions whatsoever, but

12 this particular search didn't seem very offensive.

13 Would you still defend it?

14 MR. MARCUS: If there were no -- no, we --

15 no, we think there are -- the Fourth Amendment imposes

16 restrictions -- time, place, and manner restrictions --

17 on the suspicionless searches.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: No.

19 MR. MARCUS: And so, that --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: He's asking you, I think,

21 Justice Alito's question, "Do we have to get into

22 that?" So long as this one's okay, why do -- why do we

23 have to get into whether there might be some other ones

24 that aren't okay?

25 MR. MARCUS: I -- that's correct. I don't --

1 I mean, I --

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: And it --

3 MR. MARCUS: -- I think you just --

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- it was assumed

5 California --

6 MR. MARCUS: Right.

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- didn't say if they had

8 protection against harassment and so forth. Suppose

9 they just said, "Cart blanche, you can search any

10 parolee at any time, any place." And then you'd ask

11 whether this search was reasonable.

12 MR. MARCUS: Right. And I think, in determining

13 that, you would -- in determining it and looking at the

14 facts of this case, you would -- you would apply a Fourth

15 Amendment standard to determine whether this search was

16 objectively reasonable. And you would look at factors

17 like the time, place, frequency, and manner to

18 determine whether a search was, in fact, reasonable --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: So, it would uphold this.

20 MR. MARCUS: -- and objective --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: There's --

22 MR. MARCUS: -- objective --

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- no matter now

24 unreasonable the California statute might be in other

25 applications.

1 MR. MARCUS: That's correct. And it's to see

2 whether it's objective -- whether the search in this

3 case was objectively related to the purposes of

4 supervision, to protect public safety, and to promote

5 rehabilitation. That, we think, is the test under the

6 Fourth Amendment. And while Petitioner points out that

7 there are a hundred cases out there where the standard,

8 you know, hasn't been used to throw out a search, at

9 the same time, he hasn't pointed to any cases where a

10 prosecution has been based on an abusive search that

11 this standard has been too toothless to throw out. And

12 we think that's significant, given that this type of

13 condition has been in place for over 20 years for

14 probationers, since the Bravo decision in 1987. And

15 the parole condition has been in place since 1996, when

16 the Legislature authorized this and made a considered

17 decision to switch from a reasonable-suspicion standard

18 to a suspicionless standard for parolees.

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Government -- is the

20 Government of the United States somewhat behind the

21 State of California? It's not efficient in -- as

22 efficient as California in supervising its parolees?

23 Because you don't have this rule.

24 MR. MARCUS: We don't have this program.

25 There are -- I mean, District Courts have the authority

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

62

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to impose a suspicionless search condition. And some

2 have. I think the important thing to keep in mind here

3 is that this is a -- the Court has traditionally given

4 a lot of deference to States in dealing with convicted

5 felons in their criminal justice system, in making

6 sentencing determinations, reasonable sentencing

7 determinations, as this Court emphasized in the Ewing

8 decision. And so, California clearly has a big problem

9 on their hands. The recidivism rates are demonstrated,

10 they're in the record. The -- California was

11 responding to those high recidivism rates. They were

12 also responding to some high-profile crimes involving

13 parolees. And the -- and, on top of that, we do have a

14 brief that's submitted by 21 States who say that they

15 do need this authority to effectively supervise

16 parolees.

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Has --

18 MR. MARCUS: But --

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the recidivism rate

20 gone down in the years since the Reyes decision, since

21 this is suspicionless search, as opposed to reasonable

22 suspicion?

23 MR. MARCUS: Well, I -- I mean, I'm not sure

24 if the studies have been -- statistics have been, sort

25 of, documented up to this -- to this date, but I think

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

63

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it's fair to say that it would be difficult to draw

2 conclusions from those statistics, because, of course,

3 this gives -- this provision gives the California

4 parole and police officers more authority to conduct

5 searches; and so, there's -- to the extent it's

6 increasing the detection of crime, and so more people

7 are actually being, you know, put back in prison on a

8 parole violation or a criminal violation, it wouldn't

9 necessarily mean that it's -- this isn't, you know,

10 being successful in reducing recidivism, because

11 there's --

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do --

13 MR. MARCUS: -- I mean, there's that side to

14 it, too.

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Even apart from the -- what

16 -- the lack of evidence for any change since the Reyes

17 decision, do we have any empirical evidence, perhaps

18 involving a control group, about the likelihood of the

19 -- this liberal search policy in reducing recidivism?

20 MR. MARCUS: May I answer the question, Your

21 Honor?

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead.

23 MR. MARCUS: I think, you know, traditionally

24 this Court has been very deferential to State decisions

25 on -- you know, on efficacy, on whether a particular

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

64

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 program is going to be efficacious -- I mean, cases

2 like Martinez-Fuerte and the Sitz decision involving

3 checkpoints for drunk driving -- in a court. Even

4 with, you know, very strong, you know, low efficacy

5 rates -- in, you know, a program that's showing very

6 low efficacy rates, the Court said that these are

7 judgment that -- judgments that the States need to

8 make, and they ought to be given a lot of deference,

9 even if, you know, their -- the numbers, you

10 know, of -- don't show, by clear and convincing proof,

11 that the problem isn't being ameliorated.

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

13 Marcus.

14 Mr. Long, you have 2 minutes remaining.

15 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.,

16 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

17 MR. LONG: In answer to Justice Alito's

18 question, this search is unconstitutional, because the

19 officer was completely at liberty -- he had complete

20 discretion to decide whether to search. And it would

21 not be acceptable if California said, "You can search

22 anybody on the street," if the answer was, "Well, it

23 wasn't a particularly invasive search." Granted,

24 parolees have far less Fourth Amendment rights than

25 others, but this is so much the core of the Fourth

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

65

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Amendment. This is what the framers wrote the Fourth

2 Amendment to stop, these general warrants and writs of

3 assistance. One --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: But we --

5 MR. LONG: -- consent --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- we normally don't look

7 into the mind of the officer to decide whether his

8 action was okay or not.

9 MR. LONG: Well, and we're not asking you to

10 look into the mind of the officer. It's --

11 California's system, it's quite clear -- they admitted

12 it here -- leaves it up to -- the officer can have any

13 reason for doing the search. It's arbitrary, in the

14 sense this Court would use, but not California.

15 On consent, very quickly, footnote 16 of our

16 reply brief, the California Supreme Court has said

17 repeatedly that -- including very recently, since this

18 section 3067 -- that parole is not a matter of consent;

19 it is imposed on you. This is a question of State law.

20 Perhaps this Court would read the State law

21 differently. But, as the Court said in Griffin, the

22 State Supreme Court is the last word on the questions

23 of State law.

24 As to abuses, there are a number. One that

25 I'll just mention, the California Supreme Court has

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

66
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 held that it's perfectly okay -- if the officer knows

2 somebody in the house is on parole or probation, they

3 can use that as a lever to go in and search to try to

4 find evidence about somebody else who's in the house.

5 That is permissible under the California standard.

6 But the bottom line here is that this type of

7 search regime is at the core of the prohibition of the

8 Fourth Amendment. It's what the framers wrote the

9 Fourth Amendment to prohibit. So, if parolees have any

10 Fourth Amendment rights, other than, you know, an

11 essentially useless arbitrary-and-capricious standard

12 that's never going to work, the Fourth Amendment has to

13 prohibit this search. There are many other things the

14 States can do. They have many options. This is at the

15 endpoint on the spectrum.

16 Thank you.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Long.

18 The case is submitted.

19 [Whereupon, at 11:18 a.m., the case in the

20 above-entitled matter was submitted.]
