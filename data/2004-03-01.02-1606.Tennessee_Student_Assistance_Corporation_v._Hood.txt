3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument

5 Assistance Corporation v. Pamela Hood.

6 Mr. Brand.

7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL J. BRAND

8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9 MR. BRAND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

10 the Court:

11 This Court's decisions recognize that even in

12 subject areas where Article I grants Congress complete and

13 exclusive authority to make laws, unconsenting States are

14 still immune from suits by private parties.

15 QUESTION: Well, let's talk a little bit about

16 the notion that's raised in one or more of the amicus

17 briefs, that a bankruptcy proceeding is akin to an in rem

18 proceeding or is an in rem proceeding, such as might be

19 the case in an admiralty suit where we would think the

20 State would be bound. Now, would you address that

21 argument, which I found possibly persuasive?

22 MR. BRAND: Certainly, Your Honor. We would

23 submit that there -- there is no authority from this Court

24 supporting the view that there is an in rem exception from

25 sovereign immunity in the bankruptcy context.

The

1 argument instead is made by analogy, as Your Honor 2 referred, to the -- the admiralty case of Deep Sea 3 Research, but the Deep Sea Research case is limited to the 4 admiralty context. It's limited to the special aspects of 5 admiralty law that had developed over hundreds of years, 6 certainly 200 years of -- of our Nation's experience. 7 QUESTION: Well, why doesn't it fit in the 8 bankruptcy context too where the debtor's assets are 9 assembled in kind of an in rem proceeding and the 10 creditors share in it? It could have very unfortunate 11 consequences certainly if -- if your position were upheld. 12 MR. BRAND: Well, Your Honor, although there 13 certainly are in rem aspects to bankruptcy jurisdiction in 14 the context of dealing with the property of the estate 15 that is before the court and that is in the custody of the 16 court, bankruptcy jurisdiction also embraces other -17 other aspects of in personam jurisdiction involving the 18 parties and -- and personal relationships. 19 QUESTION: Well, could we just stick with the in 20 rem for a moment? Suppose there's a $100,000 on the usual 21 free-for-all because there are more -- the -- the debts 22 exceed that amount. The State gets notice. It decides 23 it's not going to appear. The bankrupt is -- is 24 discharged. At the very least, if the State then later 25 sues on the debt, is the -- can the discharge be set up as

1 a defense? 2 MR. BRAND: Well, Your Honor, there -- there is 3 authority from -- from the lower courts that -- that it 4 could in fact, and that in -- in that situation, the - 5 the State might be bound by a general discharge order. 6 QUESTION: Well, what -- what happened here was 7 something where -- where a summons was issued to the 8 State, wasn't it? It was -- the State didn't just remain 9 outside and do nothing. 10 MR. BRAND: Well, that's -- that's exactly 11 right, Your Honor, and it also is a situation in which the 12 State was not making a claim against the -- the property 13 of the bankrupt estate. 14 QUESTION: Yes. It's hard to think of a debt as 15 part of a res. I -- I can't quite - 16 MR. BRAND: And that - 17 QUESTION: -- get that. 18 And I understand, but just on the basic point of 19 whether or not just for a discharge of a debt, the State 20 can be bound, you say you think it might be plausible, but 21 the State would be bound by the judgment if it later sues 22 on the debt. 23 MR. BRAND: I don't want to concede that point, 24 Your Honor. I think there is authority certainly that 25 would -- that could support that, and there are decisions

1 from the -- from the circuit courts, particularly the 2 Fourth, the Fifth, and the Ninth, which have held that a 3 discharge order under those circumstances would be binding 4 against the State. But each of those courts has also 5 upheld sovereign immunity as a bar to a suit against a 6 State as the State asserts in this case. 7 QUESTION: But this is not a normal suit against 8 the State. This is a suit in which the debtor seeks 9 authority to get a discharge, isn't it? 10 MR. BRAND: That's right, Your Honor, except 11 that - 12 QUESTION: So the proceeding itself is to 13 determine whether or not she's entitled to a discharge on 14 the debt at issue. 15 MR. BRAND: Yes. She is -- she has already 16 received a bankruptcy discharge, a blanket discharge from 17 debt. This is a proceeding to determine if this 18 particular debt qualifies under that. And the way the 19 statute is written, the way -- the way Congress has set 20 this up is that the debt is presumptively 21 nondischargeable. It is an exception from discharge until 22 such point as the debtor establishes undue hardship, at 23 which point the debt would be absolved and she would - 24 she would, in effect, have a discharge. But again, the - 25 by -- by the nature of the way the -

1 QUESTION: If she -- if she prevails in that

2 disputed factual matter, then it will be just like any

3 other discharge case. If -- if the hearing goes forward

4 and she prevails as a matter of fact, then it would be

5 just like any other discharge case, wouldn't it?

6 MR. BRAND: No, it wouldn't, Your Honor. A

7 normal discharge case would essentially not involve at all

8 the adjudication of individual debts. The discharge is -

9 QUESTION: No. I'm saying if she prevails on

10 the disputed issues of fact, thereafter it would be just

11 like a normal discharge case.

12

MR. BRAND:

It -- it -- yes, if I'm

13 understanding, Your Honor. Yes, she would have, in

14 effect, a discharge from that debt. Yes.

15 QUESTION: Moreover, the -- the fact that this

16 proceeding had to be brought against the State was purely

17 a result of congressional disposition. Congress could

18 have treated these debts to the State like all other

19 debts, in which case they would have been automatically

20 discharged.

21 MR. BRAND: That's exactly right, Your Honor.

22 QUESTION: So -- so that the -- the argument

23 that the bankruptcy -- the in rem nature of the bankruptcy

24 procedure gives -- gives her all the protection that the

25 Constitution at least requires, vis-a-vis the State, it

1 seems to me is a strong one. It's only because of the 2 statute that -- that this action had to be brought. If 3 Congress really wants to discharge her from debts to the 4 State, it could have done so by simply treating the State 5 like all other debtors. 6 MR. BRAND: I think that's exactly right, Your 7 Honor. The debt could be treated as a discharged debt, in 8 which case the State would certainly be bound by the 9 operation of that law, but that is not - 10 QUESTION: Isn't it -- isn't it odd that you are 11 objecting to this proceeding where, if Congress then said, 12 okay, we'll make it dischargeable, you will be worse off? 13 In other words, Congress is trying to ameliorate the 14 ordinary effect of the bankruptcy law to give the State an 15 advantage. And your argument is to the effect of, 16 Congress, you can treat us just like all the others, and 17 we'll be worse off than we are now, but once you give us 18 this favor, then you -- the -- the law is 19 unconstitutional. You can't give us a favor. That seems 20 to be the essence of your argument. 21 MR. BRAND: No, Your Honor. I -- I would submit 22 our argument -- our argument is not that the State is 23 immune from the effect of the statute that would allow 24 discharge upon showing of undue hardship. We would 25 recognize that that is -- that is an appropriate part of
8

 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1 the -- of the exercise of Congress' bankruptcy power. 2 Our issue is with the provisions which are there 3 by virtue of the nature of the way that -- that exception 4 is written and also by virtue of the bankruptcy rules that 5 require that it be raised in the form of an adversary 6 proceeding in which the State could be summoned into 7 court, in bankruptcy court, anywhere in the country. 8 MR. BRAND: Well, could it be adjudicated 9 without an adversary proceeding, just say the debtor comes 10 in and says, I'm giving notice to the State? If they want 11 to come in, they can, but it's not -- it's -- I'm not 12 going to call it or the statute doesn't call it a summons 13 and complaint, doesn't call it an adversary proceeding, 14 just a proceeding to establish the status of this 15 obligation. 16 MR. BRAND: Your Honor, I think as Justice 17 Scalia suggested, Congress could write a statute that 18 would make a student loan dischargeable, more or less by 19 operation of law, but we would submit that the way this 20 statute is written -- and again, if we look - 21 QUESTION: I'm not asking about making it 22 totally dischargeable, but Congress wants to achieve this 23 result and sensitive to your concern. So it says, fine, 24 we're going to make it nondischargeable unless the student 25 shows undue hardship, but because the State doesn't want

1 to receive a summons and complaint, we're going to do it 2 in a nonadversary proceeding. The student will establish 3 it to the satisfaction of the bankruptcy court or not, and 4 the State will be given notice but not a summons and 5 complaint. Would that be satisfactory? 6 MR. BRAND: Your Honor, I don't believe it 7 would. I think that in substance that would be 8 essentially the same as the adversary complaint that -9 that we're talking about here. And -- and under -- under 10 Coeur d'Alene and -- and the discussion in other similar 11 cases, the question here can't turn on the mechanics of 12 the pleading or on the -- the style of the caption. 13 QUESTION: So you -- you would have no problem 14 with Congress' amending this statute so that it reads if 15 the State chooses to waive its sovereign immunity, the 16 debtor has to proceed in this manner. However, if the 17 State refuses to waive its sovereign immunity by appearing 18 in the proceeding, the debt will be automatically 19 discharged. You -- you would have no problem with that, I 20 take it. 21 MR. BRAND: I'm not -- I'm not certain that that 22 would not be the same type of statute that I -- I objected 23 to a moment ago. 24 QUESTION: No. I thought you accepted that a 25 moment ago. I thought you accepted a moment ago that

1 Congress didn't have to provide this special treatment of 2 the States at all. If Congress didn't have to provide it 3 at all, certainly Congress could say if the State chooses 4 not to -- not to take it, not to appear in the proceeding, 5 we'll dispense with it. I -- it seems to me the greater 6 includes the lesser. 7 MR. BRAND: Well, I -- I agreed, Your Honor, and 8 I still agree that -- that Congress could fashion a 9 statute that would make student loans dischargeable in the 10 same manner as -- as any other debt. And in -- in that 11 case, it -- it would take place the same as any other 12 debt. And of course, if -- if the State were to waive its 13 sovereign immunity and enter into a bankruptcy proceeding 14 and -- and voluntarily participate, then -- then it could 15 do so and -- and the court could act accordingly without 16 any special enabling legislation by Congress. 17 QUESTION: I -- I don't understand what the 18 statute has -- how the statute is involved in this. I 19 mean, the statute just sets a standard for discharging a 20 -- a student who has an educational loan. It says it has 21 to be undue hardship. What's wrong with that? I mean, 22 why can't -- there are dozens of statutes -- dozens of 23 statutes that say -- I guess dozens. I'm not a bankruptcy 24 expert, but statutes that say you get this kind of a 25 discharge if there hasn't been a fraudulent conveyance,

1 but if there has been, you don't get it, and if it's this, 2 you don't get it, and if it's that, you do get it. All 3 these may involve debts owed to or -- the State. Are - 4 are you saying -- what has the statute to do with this? 5 The statute just sets a standard for getting a discharge. 6 MR. BRAND: Well, Your Honor, I -- I believe 7 that this statute -- this particular subsection affecting 8 student loan discharge is really unique within the 9 exceptions to discharge. 10 QUESTION: All right. Let's assume it's unique. 11 MR. BRAND: There - 12 QUESTION: What is it in the Constitution or the 13 Eleventh Amendment that says Congress cannot set a special 14 standard for discharging a bankrupt from a certain kind of 15 debt? 16 MR. BRAND: Congress - 17 QUESTION: What -- what in -- what in the 18 Constitution says that if that kind of debt happens to be 19 one that is owed to the State, Congress is forbidden to do 20 that? I don't -- I just don't understand it. 21 MR. BRAND: Your Honor, we -- we do not dispute 22 that Congress has the power to set a separate standard for 23 this type of debt - 24 QUESTION: I know and so why is the State, if it 25 happens to be owed that kind of money, in any sort of a
12

1 different position? 2 MR. BRAND: Well, the -- the question is not the 3 effectiveness of the congressional determination regarding 4 how to handle that debt, but rather the constitutionality 5 of the means by which Congress -6 QUESTION: Now, then what you're quarreling with 7 is, of course, not the statute. You are quarreling, as 8 Justice Ginsburg pointed out, with a bankruptcy rule that 9 happen to use the word adversary proceeding. But suppose 10 the rulemakers had simply said, this need not be done in 11 an adversary proceeding. It can be done in exactly the 12 same kind of proceeding as discharging any other kind of 13 debt. I, the bankruptcy judge, will follow the 14 congressional mandate as to when it is discharged. You 15 will notify all debtors, Mr. Bankrupt, including the 16 State, and if they want to come in and protest it, they 17 can. Now, why -- what would be unconstitutional about 18 such a provision that never uses the word adversary 19 proceeding? 20 MR. BRAND: Well, Your Honor, our objection is 21 not merely to the bankruptcy rules. I would -- I would 22 repeat that -- that -23 QUESTION: I read your position to be that the 24 State isn't bound at all, for instance, that the 25 bankruptcy court cannot discharge property liens held by
13
 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1 the State. I mean, I -- I read your position as being 2 that the State cannot be forced into any aspect of the 3 bankruptcy proceeding. 4 QUESTION: And so did I. 5 QUESTION: I guess -- I guess the -- you would 6 say the State doesn't have to abide by the automatic stay. 7 MR. BRAND: Oh, certainly not, Your Honor. 8 Certainly not. And I thought that we were clear in our 9 briefing that we -- we recognize that the -- the State 10 would be bound by the automatic stay because it's 11 automatic. It is by operation of law and by operation of 12 the Supremacy Clause - 13 QUESTION: I'd rather like to get the answer to 14 the question which is I understand what position you took 15 in the brief. I want to know why. I want to know what 16 the logic is. I can't find anything in the Constitution 17 that says that Congress cannot impose the same standard in 18 respect to discharging a debt owed to the State as it 19 applies to a debt owed to anybody else. Now, either you 20 agree with that proposition or you don't. And if you 21 don't -- and I think you don't -- I'd like to know what 22 the theory is. 23 MR. BRAND: Your Honor, I agree that Congress 24 can make those distinctions. I - 25 QUESTION: Fine. Once you agree with the
14
 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1 proposition, then all your objecting to is the word 2 adversary in the word adversary proceeding, and it takes 3 3 minutes or less for a good expert simply to get rid of 4 that adversary proceeding and have the same thing done in 5 an ordinary proceeding. 6 Now, I want to know the answer to what I say, 7 not that you disagree with it. I know you disagree with 8 it. I want to know why you disagree with it. 9 MR. BRAND: I disagree with it because the -10 the legislative reports as to that subsection, section 11 5239(a)(8), strongly point out that the statute -- that 12 that subsection is intended to be self-executing and that 13 the creditor, the lender, the guaranteer, the -- the 14 guarantee institution, are not required to initiate action 15 but instead can rely on the nondischarge, on the exception 16 from discharge. 17 So by -- by structuring the -- the exception 18 that way, we would submit that Congress, as this Court has 19 recognized in other situations, has given elevated status 20 to that creditor's position, has recognized that creditors 21 of those kinds of debts have interests in the payment of 22 those debts that outweigh the normal fresh-start policy 23 that -- that underlies bankruptcy. So our position is 24 that it does turn on the nature of the statute and not 25 merely those bankruptcy rules that require -

1 QUESTION: The statute -- the statute doesn't - 2 doesn't require, does it, that that preferred position be 3 established in an adversary proceeding? 4 MR. BRAND: Certainly not by express terms, Your 5 Honor, but -- but again, the rules -- rules made 6 consistent with that statute, together with that 7 legislative purpose, would certainly indicate that -8 that - 9 QUESTION: And I suppose you're saying this is 10 an adversary proceeding. Regardless of whether - 11 MR. BRAND: Oh - 12 QUESTION: -- regardless of how -- how it got to 13 be so, whether it got to be so through rule or through 14 anything else, it's an adversary proceeding and the State 15 cannot be hailed in in this fashion. 16 MR. BRAND: That's exactly right, Your Honor. 17 There's no dispute about that. I mean, this - 18 QUESTION: No, but there is a dispute about 19 whether you could, in fact, call this kind of adversary 20 proceeding, given the underlying standard that all it is 21 is a way of getting to the same result, really not an 22 adversary proceeding for purposes of the Eleventh 23 Amendment, since it has no functional difference 24 whatsoever from a proceeding that isn't labeled adversary 25 but simply gives the State notice of what's going on and

1 permits the State to come in, just as if it worked, which 2 is ordinary proceedings. 3 MR. BRAND: Except that ordinary proceedings in 4 bankruptcy, as I mentioned earlier, do not involve the 5 individualized adjudication of debts. They involve other 6 issues. They involve martialing the assets. They involve 7 assessing the - 8 QUESTION: That's a good answer. 9 QUESTION: Mr. Brand, can I ask you - 10 QUESTION: Now, what about - 11 QUESTION: May I ask one question? Did I 12 understand you correctly to say that you did not contest 13 the fact that if -- if -- that if they had a blanket rule 14 that all student loans are automatically dischargeable, 15 that would be true even if the creditor was a State? 16 MR. BRAND: Certainly, Your Honor, and the - 17 QUESTION: And does that mean you also would 18 agree that any ordinary commercial obligation to the State 19 such as paying rent for an -- an office suite or something 20 like that could also be dischargeable and there would be 21 no sovereign immunity problem there? 22 MR. BRAND: Yes, Your Honor, and the reason - 23 the reason I agree to that is because that does not 24 require an adjudication. It -- it would occur by 25 operation of law by which -

1 QUESTION: Well, but there has to be -- there

2 has to be a final order in the bankruptcy proceeding

3 discharging -- you know, giving the -- the debtor a

4 discharge.

5 MR. BRAND: But we would submit in a -- in a

6 very real sense that would be surplusage.

7 QUESTION: But the -- but the net result is I

8 thought your position in your brief was somewhat different

9 from that. That's why I wanted to be sure about it. You

10 do agree that -- that the sovereign immunity is not a

11 valid objection to a discharge of a bankrupt estate.

12 MR. BRAND: That's -- that's right when the

13 discharge is by operation of law. And again, I would

14 analogize to the -- the situation of the automatic stay

15 provision that -- that Justice O'Connor raised. Again,

16 that operates automatically when the -

17 QUESTION: So, but the difference in the

18 automatic stay if the -- if the debtor had to go in and

19 prove his name, serial number, and rank or something

20 first, so it wasn't completely automatic, then you would

21 say you have a sovereign immunity objection.

22 MR. BRAND: Possibly, possibly not. Again, I

23 would submit that there's authority from lower courts that

24 would -- would possibly -

QUESTION:

Well, I'm really not so much

1 interested in the authority from the lower courts as I am 2 curious about your position. What exactly does the 3 sovereign immunity defense protect for you? 4 MR. BRAND: In this case the sovereign immunity 5 defense protects the State from being made a defendant and 6 from having compulsory process issued against it to appear 7 in a bankruptcy court that could be in any State of the 8 union in this case. 9 Now, the -- the reason I was referring to 10 authority from other courts is to -- is to remind the 11 Court that all of the courts that have -- that have made 12 the type of holding that Your Honor is referring to have 13 also recognized the applicability of Eleventh Amendment 14 immunity in adversary settings. 15 QUESTION: I know, but it seems to me somewhat 16 anomalous to say that if you want to do it without giving 17 us a hearing, you can go ahead and do it, but if you give 18 us notice and a hearing and an opportunity to respond, 19 then you're protected by the Eleventh Amendment. 20 MR. BRAND: Well, again - 21 QUESTION: A rather strange position. 22 MR. BRAND: -- again, Your Honor, I think -- I 23 think we're talking about very different things there. 24 There is -- there is quite a difference between the 25 general discharge, which again occurs without

1 individualized adjudication of -- of debts -- that is -2 that is a distinct thing under the bankruptcy laws from a 3 situation in -- in which there's a proceeding involving 4 the dischargeability of a particular debt - 5 QUESTION: Well, you say - 6 MR. BRAND: -- such as we have here. 7 QUESTION: -- it could well be that the State 8 filed a claim and proved up its claim and then there's not 9 enough money to pay it, the claim, but there would be some 10 kind of proceeding to establish the claim. Would that be 11 different then? 12 MR. BRAND: Well, in -- in a case where the 13 State had filed a claim, the State would have voluntarily 14 appeared in the -- in the proceeding as relates to the 15 subject matter of that claim. So there would not be any 16 sovereign immunity situation there at all. 17 QUESTION: So that if the State voluntarily 18 appears, it would automatically waive its sovereign 19 immunity defense. 20 MR. BRAND: As to that claim, yes. 21 QUESTION: Well, that's the Gardner case, isn't 22 it? The -23 MR. BRAND: Yes, I believe so. Yes, Gardner v. 24 New Jersey. 25 QUESTION: Tell me how bankruptcy works. Is the

1 United States trustee potentially part of any proceeding 2 that the trustee wants to be involved in? Can the trustee 3 have come into this proceeding voluntarily if -- if he or 4 she chose? 5 MR. BRAND: I -- I believe so, Your Honor, but 6 I'm not certain if that is applicable in every -- in every 7 district. And I'm not -- I apologize. I'm not certain as 8 to that. I know the U.S. trustees have -- have those 9 powers and responsibilities in at least -- at least a good 10 number of bankruptcy - 11 QUESTION: Because it does seem that if an 12 action is brought by a U.S. trustee, that's an officer - 13 that's the Federal Government. 14 MR. BRAND: Well, certainly that would be a 15 different situation and certainly the State - 16 QUESTION: Which is another way of solving this 17 problem. 18 MR. BRAND: That's right, Your Honor. That's - 19 that's conceivable. Certainly the State would have no 20 sovereign immunity from -- from an action by the United 21 States. 22 QUESTION: In -- in a world of limited 23 resources, especially for the U.S. trustee -- this is a 24 no-asset bankruptcy. If the U.S. trustee is going to come 25 into each one of these proceedings, it might be rather

1 impractical.

2 I was curious about the credit -- the creditor

3 class for these student loans. It's not just States that

4 are creditors when a student tries to get out from under

5 the student's debts. What -- what other entities would be

6 in this situation, not with respect to sovereign immunity,

7 but as someone who has loaned money to a student?

8

MR. BRAND:

Well, certainly any lending

9 institution could -- could be involved as a -- as a

10 creditor in a student loan. The -- the Federal and -- and

11 I guess there are State programs as well, but involve

12 fairly complicated relationships between lending

13 institutions and secondary holders and guarantors at -- at

14 various levels.

15 QUESTION: Do you know what part of the business

16 the States have, to what extent, compared to other

17 creditors, other lenders?

18 MR. BRAND: Well, the -- I -- I can speak for

19 the State of Tennessee. The State of Tennessee is

20 involved as a guarantor, not as a lender, but merely as a

21 guarantor in conjunction mainly with these -- these

22 Federal loan programs. And the -- the State of Tennessee

23 is participating not as a -- a business actor, but as a

24 means of -- of pursuing the public policy of making it

25 simpler and easier for Tennessee residents to obtain a

1 college education. So the -- the State as a guarantor is 2 -- is not in this -- in the position at all of an ordinary 3 creditor, really, as far as its -- as far as its purpose 4 and -- and even as far as its -- probably its financial 5 calculations in -- in how to deal with that. Again, it's 6 -- it's a matter of pursuing the public policy of making 7 it easier for -- for the students, for these debtors to 8 obtain their college education. 9 QUESTION: So for -- for the primary lender, 10 this procedure would be fine. The -- so the debt wouldn't 11 be dischargeable to the initial creditor, the one who 12 loans - 13 MR. BRAND: I -- I believe -- I believe, Your 14 Honor, certainly the -- the initial creditor could 15 certainly be involved, would have no sovereign immunity 16 defense. There would still be the requirement of the 17 undue hardship showing. 18 QUESTION: But if you -- if you -- Congress was 19 to say, well, too bad, we tried to give them a break, we 20 can't do it, so we're going to make them dischargeable 21 just like any other debt, that would have a very adverse 22 effect on all the other creditors in the picture who are 23 not State actors. 24 MR. BRAND: It certainly would, Your Honor, but 25 it also could create complications as far as -- as far as
23

1 whether States would choose to participate in -- in 2 student loan programs. Again, it's a policy determination 3 made State by State. There's no requirement that the 4 States participate in -- in such programs. 5 It -- it's part of the balancing of those 6 interests I think that has resulted in this statute and in 7 this statute being written the way it is. At one point in 8 time not too long ago, student loans were discharged in an 9 ordinary bankruptcy, and then it was -- it was cut back to 10 only loans that had been in -- in payment more than - 11 more than 5 -- more than 7 years and more than 5 years, 12 and now, of course, it's cut back all the way to where 13 it's only subject to discharge upon a showing of undue 14 hardship. So there's -- there's definitely a policy of 15 wanting to make student loan repayment more certain and 16 make that a -- a different relationship from other 17 debtor/creditor relationships. 18 If there are no further questions from the Court 19 at this time, I would like to reserve the remainder of our 20 time. I would ask that the judgment of the Sixth Circuit 21 be reversed. 22 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Brand. 23 Mr. Gerson, we'll hear from you. 24 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD H. GERSON 25 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

1 MR. GERSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 2 please the Court: 3 The questioning of the petitioner reflected the 4 fact that there is an inherent conflict between the 5 requirements of the operation of the bankruptcy system and 6 the State's sovereign immunity. This conflict has been 7 recognized in this Court's past opinions. For example, in 8 Van Huffel v. Harkelrode, a 1931 decision of this Court, 9 it was claimed that the sale of a debtor's property free 10 and clear of -- of the State's tax lien was not effective 11 because the State lacked jurisdiction. This -12 QUESTION: The State lacked? 13 MR. GERSON: Jurisdiction over the - 14 QUESTION: The State lacked? 15 QUESTION: The Supreme Court. 16 MR. GERSON: I'm -- I'm sorry, Your Honor. The 17 Court lacked jurisdiction over the State. And this Court 18 denied that -- the State's position. 19 Subsequent to that in Gardner/New Jersey, which 20 is a case that -- that which is noted for waiver, the 21 State also took the position that not -- that the property 22 that was a part of the debtor's estate was limited to the 23 debtor's equity and did not include that portion of the 24 property of the debtor that was subject to the State's tax 25 lien. Again, this Court said, no, all property of the
25

1 debtor is part of the estate, including that part that's 2 subject to a State's tax lien. 3 QUESTION: Of course, in that case the State had 4 come into bankruptcy -- the bankruptcy court voluntarily. 5 MR. GERSON: That's correct, Your Honor. But 6 the opinion -- that portion of the opinion in Gardner that 7 addresses that issue does not rely upon the fact that the 8 State filed a proof of claim. 9 QUESTION: If -- if we were to analogize 10 bankruptcy proceedings to in rem proceedings in general, 11 nevertheless this dischargeability proceeding is set up 12 under the rules as an adversary one where a notice and a 13 summons is filed on the State. That's a product of how 14 the rules are constructed. Now, presumably in time they 15 could be changed, but what about this case? 16 MR. GERSON: To allow this case to be determined 17 on the basis that an adversary proceeding had been filed 18 would be elevating form over substance because the 19 jurisdiction of the court with respect to the claim arises 20 from the court's jurisdiction over the property of the 21 estate and claims made against it and the -- and the 22 debtor. They're all part of the res. So the filing of an 23 adversary proceeding was merely a manner -- merely 24 allowing the State to -- to be provided with an elevated 25 form of notice rather than being jurisdictional.

1 In addition, 28 U.S.C. 2075 states that the 2 rules, bankruptcy rules, should not in any way abridge or 3 modify the substantive rights that are granted under the 4 code, and I believe in these circumstances to allow this 5 decision to be based upon the fact that an adversary 6 proceeding had been filed would have the effect of 7 abridging Ms. Hood's rights - 8 QUESTION: Well - 9 MR. GERSON: -- by denying here an opportunity 10 for hardship. 11 QUESTION: What happens when you don't show up 12 in an adversary proceeding? 13 MR. GERSON: A default judgment is entered. 14 QUESTION: A default judgment. 15 MR. GERSON: Yes. 16 QUESTION: So how can you say -- I mean, had it 17 not been set up this way, I would assume that the 18 bankruptcy judge would have to make his or her own 19 determination about whether the condition of the statute 20 had been met, but once you have this adversary system set 21 up, I assume the bankruptcy judge is entirely within his 22 or her rights by just saying, hey, the State hasn't shown 23 up, the State loses. 24 MR. GERSON: I would -- I'd like - 25 QUESTION: Now, that -- that doesn't seem to me
27

1 to be elevating form over substance. That -- that's a big 2 difference. 3 MR. GERSON: Yes, and I -- I believe I 4 incorrectly stated what would happen, Your Honor. It's - 5 even -- even in an adversary proceeding, the court would 6 still have to find that Ms. Hood had demonstrated a right 7 to a -- to an undue hardship discharge. 8 QUESTION: So it wouldn't just go by default 9 then if the State didn't show up? 10 MR. GERSON: That's correct, Your Honor. 11 QUESTION: Do you know any other adversary 12 proceedings that work that way? I mean, I suppose that 13 depends on what the -- what the rule means, but when the 14 rule describes it as an adversary proceeding, I -- I would 15 take it to mean that if the other side doesn't show up, it 16 loses. 17 QUESTION: Well, in a -- in a -- in an ordinary 18 suit for money judgment, if the defendant fails to show 19 up, he can be defaulted as to liability, but he still has 20 to show the money damages. He just doesn't get the amount 21 that he says in his complaint. 22 MR. GERSON: That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice. 23 QUESTION: Well, is -- is the amount at issue 24 here? 25 MR. GERSON: The amount is at issue only to the
28
 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1 extent that in order to show undue hardship, Ms. Hood has 2 to demonstrate that she can't repay it. 3 QUESTION: Yes, but the -- but the -- the 4 amount, how much it is, is not -- is not in controversy, 5 is it? 6 MR. GERSON: No, it's not. 7 QUESTION: I thought - 8 QUESTION: So what is the situation there? I 9 mean, I don't want you just to drop this. That is, is an 10 adversary proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code -- and 11 there are quite a few. You've said two opposite things 12 now. Your first time you said, well, if the other party 13 doesn't show up, the bankruptcy judge can just say, 14 debtor, you win. Okay? Without looking at the merits. 15 And the second time you said, no, that's not really so. 16 The bankruptcy judge has to satisfy himself that the 17 statutory standard is met. 18 Now, I guess this isn't the only place where 19 there's a adversary proceeding in the code. So which is 20 it? Is it like an -- and how do I find out? If you're 21 uncertain, what do I look up to try to find out the answer 22 to that question? 23 MR. GERSON: Well, Justice Breyer, very often 24 adversary proceedings are commenced in bankruptcy court 25 and they're necessary when the kind of action that dispute
29
 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1 -- in dispute is the equivalent of an action that could

2 have been commenced prior to the establishment of the

3 bankruptcy. It's just --

4 QUESTION: Yes, I -

5 MR. GERSON: -- prior, you know, action now

6 brought into the bankruptcy court. And then the

7 bankruptcy court could issue a default judgment because -

8 QUESTION: No, I got that.

9 MR. GERSON: -- it would be a traditional

10 action.

11 QUESTION: So maybe there are no others. Are

12 there -- are there any adversary proceedings, other than

13 this, one which isn't like what you just described?

14 QUESTION: Well, certainly an action by a

15 trustee for -- of voidable preference would be quite

16 different, would it not?

17

MR. GERSON:

With respect to a voidable

18 preference, if -- if the defendant did not demonstrate it

19 had any defense, a judgment would be issued in favor of

20 the -- the State because there is a presumption for a

21 voidable preference once certain factors are met.

22 QUESTION: And there you're getting money from

23 outside the estate too. You're getting a money judgment

24 against somebody that would increase the assets of the

25 estate.

30

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1 MR. GERSON: That's correct, Your Honor, but it 2 is not Ms. Hood's position in this case that a preference 3 action would fall within the traditional in rem 4 jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court and thus the State 5 sovereign immunity would be abrogated. 6 QUESTION: So you would -- you would say that if 7 the -- if there were a suit for a voidable preference 8 against the State, the Eleventh Amendment rule would 9 prevail? 10 MR. GERSON: I -- that issue is unclear, Your 11 Honor. It's certainly not Ms. Hood's position that the 12 Eleventh Amendment would not prevail. And there's 13 actually a case pending before this Court right now, 14 Massachusetts v. H.J. Wilson, where at issue is the 15 debtor's demand for an income tax refund. So the 16 opportunity to visit the issue of affirmative monetary 17 relief against a State and its -- and the ramifications of 18 the Eleventh Amendment can be addressed in that case. 19 It's - 20 QUESTION: We're trying to get -- I'm trying to 21 get the answer still to Justice Scalia's question. Take 22 the question the Chief Justice asked. It's a preference 23 action. It's a kind of bankruptcy action. It's in an 24 adversary proceeding. Is that right? 25 MR. GERSON: Yes.
31

1 QUESTION: Okay. Now, the other side doesn't 2 show up. Okay, forget this Eleventh Amendment business. 3 I just want to know the normal thing in bankruptcy. 4 What's the answer? If he doesn't show up, is he defaulted 5 like a regular case outside the court, or does the trustee 6 -- I mean, does the judge, the bankruptcy judge, look at 7 the matter and make up his own mind independently about 8 whether it was a preference or not? How does it work in 9 bankruptcy? 10 MR. GERSON: It would -- it would not be a 11 default judgment, Your Honor. It would be a judgment on 12 the merits. 13 QUESTION: I have one other technical question. 14 Suppose we were to say - 15 QUESTION: Excuse me. I didn't understand that 16 answer. It would not be a default judgment. It would be 17 a judgment on the merits. Is there a distinction? 18 MR. GERSON: It would be a judgment - 19 QUESTION: I thought default judgments are, for 20 all purposes, considered judgments on the merits. For 21 what purpose is a default judgment not a judgment on the 22 merits? 23 MR. GERSON: Oh, to -- to the extent it is - 24 there's greater flexibility of a defendant to come back 25 and ask for reconsideration, I believe, under normal
32
 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1 procedures. 2 QUESTION: That doesn't make it not a decision 3 on the merits. It may be subject to reopening, but a 4 default judgment is a judgment. 5 MR. GERSON: That's correct. 6 QUESTION: I thought that the question we -- we 7 were talking about before -- that there was a clear and 8 certain answer to the question, that -- that if the claim 9 is made that there's undue hardship, even if the State 10 doesn't show up -- well, let's take the -- because this is 11 written for all creditors and not particularly with States 12 in mind. If the creditor doesn't show up, the bankruptcy 13 judge still has to find that there's undue hardship in 14 order to make this dischargeable. 15 MR. GERSON: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. 16 QUESTION: And where does that come from? I - 17 that was my understanding about the way it works, but is 18 that a statute, a rule? Where does -- where does that 19 come from? 20 MR. GERSON: I think it comes from the natural 21 reading of the statute that such a finding has to be made 22 that there would be an undue hardship for the debtor to 23 have to repay that -- that loan. 24 QUESTION: You -- you could say the same about 25 any default judgment in a case -- in a tort action where
33
 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1 the tort statute, you know, only imposes liability where

2 the defendant has been negligent. The defendant doesn't

3 show up. The court doesn't -- doesn't enter into its own

4 independent inquiry as to whether the defendant was

5 negligent. It enters default judgment. And the statute,

6 just as clearly, requires negligence there as this statute

7 requires undue hardship here.

8 MR. GERSON: The difference -- the difference is

9 -- Your Honor, is that all of the property of a debtor and

10 claims against that property -- they're -- they're all

11 under the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction.

So a

12 bankruptcy court has a special obligation to -- to protect

13 the interests of all creditors and the estate, and I

14 believe because of that, it would have a heightened

15 responsibility to determine whether there was a basis for

16 an undue hardship discharge because the decision is not

17 solely -- is -- is affecting everyone.

18 QUESTION: In the voidable preference case, it's

19 -- it's as if we're -- the suggestion is is that the

20 bankruptcy court has the authority to order the res

21 brought before it, commanding the State to deliver the

22 res, i.e., the voidable preference.

23 MR. GERSON: I -- there is a question that -

24 QUESTION: And -- please.

25 MR. GERSON: -- with -- with regard to a

34

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1 voidable preference action whether the funds the debtor 2 would be seeking would be part of the res because it's not 3 in the possession of the estate. 4 QUESTION: Right. 5 MR. GERSON: And certainly that distinction can 6 be made as made in California v. -- v. Deep Sea Research, 7 that if the property is in the possession of the -- of the 8 State, rather than the debtor, a different result is 9 required with respect to the Eleventh Amendment. 10 QUESTION: Well, before the Bankruptcy Act in 11 1978, bankruptcy courts couldn't try voidable preferences. 12 That had to be in the district court I believe. 13 MR. GERSON: That's correct, Justice Rehnquist. 14 QUESTION: If in fact we assume -- let's suppose 15 when we look into this -- suppose I was to come to the 16 conclusion that an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy is 17 identical to a case that has nothing to do with bankruptcy 18 in a court. You say isn't, and maybe that's so and we'll 19 find out. All right. 20 Now, if that were so and if that meant under the 21 Court's case law that this particular adversary proceeding 22 were invalid under the Eleventh Amendment, would the 23 bankruptcy judge under section 105 or some other section 24 or would the Rules Committee have the power without going 25 back to Congress to devise a different procedure that
35
 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1 would get to exactly the same place, say, a procedure that 2 had the bankruptcy judge adjudicate this under the same 3 standard while notifying the State, like any other 4 creditor, that it could intervene at is choice. 5 MR. GERSON: Yes, it could, Your Honor. And - 6 and the basis for that would be to reconciling the 7 requirements of 28 U.S.C. 2075 and the requirement for the 8 bankruptcy rules because under 105, a court could rule 9 that it would be inappropriate to enforce the requirement 10 of Bankruptcy Rule 7001, which requires an adversary 11 proceeding. So 105 would give a bankruptcy court that 12 power and I believe it would be an appropriate exercise of 13 that power. 14 QUESTION: And even without 105, could the Rules 15 Committee then devise a different rule? 16 MR. GERSON: Certainly, Your Honor. 17 QUESTION: Mr. Gerson, you -- your position 18 depends heavily on the characterization of bankruptcy 19 proceedings as in rem, and one can understand that about 20 the bankrupt estate, it collects whatever assets there are 21 and distributes them. But this is a no-asset bankruptcy. 22 So how does the in rem characterization fit a case where 23 there are no assets? 24 MR. GERSON: Because the debtor itself, at least 25 the pre-petition debtor, is also considered part of the

1 res, part of the bankruptcy court's in rem jurisdiction. 2 That was reflected in Hanover National Bank v. Moyses 3 where the creditor complained that its debt had been 4 discharged, but it had never received -- no summons or 5 complaint had ever been filed. In fact, it complained it 6 had never received notice. And this Court's response was, 7 no, bankruptcy is a form of in rem jurisdiction, and on 8 that basis the -- the claim of that creditor could be 9 discharged even though no adversary -- no summons and 10 complaint was filed. Notice as a motion was sufficient, 11 and it based - 12 QUESTION: So what you're saying is the -- is 13 the debtor is not a thing, is not a res, but a debtor - 14 this is an adjudication over a status which traditionally 15 is also in rem. 16 MR. GERSON: That's correct, Your Honor. I know 17 it doesn't entirely fit our traditional notions of what a 18 res is, but it's consistent with how this Court has 19 traditionally understood the in rem jurisdiction of a 20 bankruptcy court and the needs of a bankruptcy court to 21 satisfy its essential functions. 22 The kinds of contradictions that are being 23 raised in the questioning are reflective of what's 24 happened in the circuit courts of appeal where the Fourth 25 Circuit, the Fifth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit all have
37
 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1 recognized and have stated in -- in earlier opinions that 2 the Seminole Tribe doctrine applied in bankruptcy but 3 later recognized an in rem exception to allow for the 4 discharge of debts with respect to the Fifth Circuit and 5 the Ninth Circuit and -- and the Fourth Circuit, and the 6 Fourth Circuit also recognized that principle with respect 7 to the confirmation of a plan and its binding effect upon 8 a State. So right now bankruptcy law is in an 9 inconsistent muddle with respect to the applicability of 10 the Eleventh Amendment, and this case allows this Court an 11 opportunity to reconcile that inconsistency as - 12 QUESTION: Only a small piece of it, according 13 to what you told us earlier, because you said this doesn't 14 involve the preference question. 15 MR. GERSON: That's -- that's correct, Your 16 Honor. Of course, this Court could rule that given the 17 traditional in rem nature of a bankruptcy and the fact 18 that, particularly under the Bankruptcy Act a preference, 19 as Chief Justice Rehnquist pointed out, was not part of 20 the bankruptcy summary jurisdiction but required a plenary 21 action, that in fact actions requiring any affirmative 22 monetary relief against a State are not part of a debtor's 23 -- are not part of a bankruptcy court's in rem 24 jurisdiction, if it chose. 25 If there are no more questions, thank you.

1 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gerson. 2 Mr. Brand, you have 4 minutes remaining. 3 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL J. BRAND 4 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 5 MR. BRAND: Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Chief 6 Justice, and may it please the Court: 7 The State's position in this case is that a 8 proceeding under the law which requires the State to make 9 a choice between voluntarily entering the proceeding or 10 sitting back and suffering a loss of its -- of its rights 11 is every bit as coercive whether it's styled as a motion 12 or an adversary proceeding or -- or anything else, is 13 every bit as coercive as a lawsuit similar to the -- the 14 situation with the administrative proceedings in the 15 Federal Maritime Commission case. 16 QUESTION: Is that loss of its right automatic? 17 What is your answer to the question of whether, if you 18 don't show up, a default judgment is entered automatically 19 against you, or does the bankruptcy judge have to make the 20 assessment of whether there's an undue hardship? 21 MR. BRAND: I am not certain, Your Honor, but I 22 believe that an undue hardship showing would still be 23 necessary. 24 But in either -- in either situation, the State 25 would suffer the consequences of losing its rights subject

1 to an adjudication, not subject to the mere operation of 2 law as with the general discharge at the conclusion of a 3 -- of an ordinary bankruptcy proceeding. 4 As -- as far as the preference actions go, this 5 case -- I'm sorry -- this Court decided in Hoffman v. 6 Connecticut which involved a preference action and even 7 more than that, a turnover action where there actually was 8 property of the estate that the -- that the bankrupt 9 trustee was -- was entitled to recover, that in either of 10 those types of situations, the Eleventh Amendment applied. 11 Now, of course, that case turned on whether Congress had 12 -- had made a clear statement in the statute, but in any 13 event, the Court, having found that the -- that the 14 Congress did not make a clear statement of intent to 15 override sovereign immunity, applied the Eleventh 16 Amendment to that preference action, that turnover action 17 in that case. 18 Now, in this case we have no property. The -19 the debtor is not seeking to -- to get property. The - 20 the creditor is not seeking to make a claim out of the 21 property of the estate. So we would submit that -- that 22 the Court can decide this case, which involves a simple 23 adversary proceeding on its face, the issuance of 24 compulsory process without even reaching the question of 25 whether a similar effect would -- would occur in -- in a
40

1 preference action or in any other type of bankruptcy 2 action. 3 So I'd like to emphasize to the Court that this 4 is an unusual statute, and the question in this case is, 5 does the Eleventh Amendment apply in the bankruptcy 6 context? But the precise circumstances of this case can 7 well limit a court's holding to the question of whether 8 sovereign immunity protects the State in an adversary 9 proceeding on this particular type of statute for a 10 particular exception from discharge. 11 If there are no further questions - 12 QUESTION: I do have. Would you tell me again, 13 what -- what's the cite to the case about the turnover 14 that you just cited? 15 MR. BRAND: It's - 16 QUESTION: What is the name of the case? 17 MR.
