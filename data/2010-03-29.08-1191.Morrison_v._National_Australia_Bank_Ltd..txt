1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:07 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument next this morning in Case 08-1191, Morrison v. 5 National Australia Bank. 6 Mr. Dubbs. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A. DUBBS 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. DUBBS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 Given that the issue of subject matter 12 jurisdiction appears not to be in dispute, the issues 13 before the Court today are: 14 First, the scope of section 10(b) of the 15 1934 Exchange Act when applied to alleged fraudulent 16 conduct with respect to financial information that is to 17 be sent to Australia for incorporation into the 18 financial statements of the Respondent, National 19 Australia Bank. 20 And second, the reasonableness of the 21 application of the statute under these circumstances and 22 the norms of enforcement pursuant to the private cause 23 of action or otherwise. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess there's also the 25 issue of whether, if everybody is agreed that it is not
3 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 a jurisdictional question, that's the end of the case. 2 I mean, as I recall, the other side says we shouldn't 3 get to the merits. 4 MR. DUBBS: Your Honor, it's our view that 5 that -- that is a possible outcome, which of course as I 6 understand it would leave -- leave the decision below 7 standing. We have urged in the supplemental brief that 8 it may want to remand for consideration of the change of 9 position of the Securities and Exchange Commission with 10 respect to the tests that they have - 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you are not -- you are 12 not pressing that? 13 MR. DUBBS: No, we still believe that the 14 best way to handle the case is to remand; but we leave 15 that for the Court's discretion. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why wouldn't that simply 17 be going through the motions? The Second Circuit put 18 the wrong label on it, but everything it said could have 19 been plugged into: Our decision is under Rule 12(b)(6) 20 rather than 12(b)(1)? 21 MR. DUBBS: Well, Your Honor, the question 22 and the issue is inherently somewhat speculative as to 23 what the Second Circuit would do, but we would rely not 24 necessarily only on the subject matter jurisdiction 25 issues being addressed -- and Your Honor is quite right
4 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that they may say, well, the label's changed, but 2 everything else stays the same. What we particularly 3 thought might be instructive for this Court is to hear 4 what the Second Circuit that sits in our nation's 5 financial capital thought of a new fact, and that new 6 fact is that for the first time the Securities and 7 Exchange Commission has come in and said as a matter of 8 administrative deference the Court should defer to our 9 test in cases like that. 10 Sure, they have submitted amicus briefs in 11 the past. They have done lots of things. But this is 12 the first time they have said: We as the agency 13 responsible for the statute have said this is how courts 14 should handle the case. That's what's new and 15 different, but if Your Honors don't wish to proceed 16 along that line we are prepared to go forward on -- on 17 the merits here today. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it seems to me that 19 isn't worth anything, right? I mean, that's -- they 20 haven't conducted a rulemaking or anything. 21 MR. DUBBS: Well, they haven't conducted - 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: They just -- just appeared 23 in court. 24 MR. DUBBS: Well, they haven't conducted a 25 full rulemaking that would be entitled to Chevron
5 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 deference. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 3 MR. DUBBS: But they have done something 4 less than that. And whether it's entitled to deference, 5 Skidmore deference, or something lesser than that is an 6 open point. But so we leave it to the Court's decision 7 as to whether it is just - 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that they don't come 9 out on your side anyway, do they? 10 MR. DUBBS: Well, Your Honor, they come out 11 on our side except for that last turn they make at the 12 end, where they -- they bring in the intervening clause 13 at the end of the last act. Other than that - 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could they come down 15 on your side if they say there is no private right of 16 action? 17 MR. DUBBS: Well, they didn't say there was 18 no private right of action. What they said was there 19 was no private right of action in this case because of 20 their application of the intervening clause test, which 21 we submit was error and clear error in light of the 22 factors that have to go into the intervening - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: We are only talking about 24 this case. I mean - 25 MR. DUBBS: Sorry?

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: We are only talking about 2 this case, right? If we send it back, we send it back 3 to have this case decided and they'd come out against 4 you in this case. 5 MR. DUBBS: They - 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: So what could -- and that 7 is going to change the Second Circuit's view of things, 8 the fact that, in addition to their initial opinion, it 9 has been reconfirmed, although on different grounds, 10 by -- by the government? 11 MR. DUBBS: Your Honor - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is no reason to send 13 it back. 14 MR. DUBBS: Well, Your Honor, it's -- it's 15 up to the Court. I mean, it's your -- you're basically 16 educating -- making an educated guess as to whether the 17 Second Circuit would pay attention to the SEC. In the 18 past, they have. They may not now. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dubbs, you said 20 something that I thought quite revealing in this -- in 21 your brief. I mean, this case is Australian plaintiff, 22 Australian defendant, shares purchased in Australia. It 23 has "Australia" written all over it. And in your reply 24 brief you said: "If the Plaintiff is a foreign 25 securities purchaser as this one is, Sinochem makes it
7 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 clear that forum non conveniens may dictate dismissal of 2 an action brought in the U.S." 3 And taking that, why not -- of the 4 applicable laws to this transaction, to this alleged 5 fraud, isn't the most appropriate choice the law of 6 Australia rather than the law of the United States? 7 MR. DUBBS: No - 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not just a question of 9 proper forum, but the proper law? 10 MR. DUBBS: No, Your Honor. We think that, 11 given the scope of section 10(b), American law can and 12 should be applied here. And we respectfully disagree 13 with the observation that this case has "Australia" 14 written all over it. Indeed, from our point of view it 15 has "Florida" written all over it because Florida is 16 where the numbers were doctored, Florida is where the 17 fraudulent conduct in putting the phony assumptions into 18 the valuation portfolio were done. Everything 19 happened - 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If all that were done and 21 it were never communicated, there wouldn't be any 22 violation. 23 MR. DUBBS: That's correct, Your Honor. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the communication was 25 done in Australia by the Australian bank.
8 Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. DUBBS: The communication was done 2 between Florida and -- and Australia, and the senior 3 management of HomeSide in Florida created those numbers 4 with the expectation and the knowledge that those would 5 go into the financial statement. So that means there is 6 substantial conduct in Florida in terms of the fraud. 7 They made the misrepresentation pursuant to what "make" 8 means, pursuant to the 1934 dictionary. 9 They engaged in hard-core fraudulent conduct 10 by doctoring the books, by putting the phony assumptions 11 into the computer model. Without that there wouldn't 12 have been a phony number. In one sense it's a one-issue 13 case, or a one-number case, which is the mortgage 14 servicing rights number that appears on -- on the 15 balance sheet at page 11 - 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's -- let's go back to 17 the question that I asked you about the appropriate 18 forum. You -- you seem to give this very case -- the 19 plaintiff is a foreign securities purchaser. When the 20 plaintiff's choice is not -- is not its home forum, the 21 presumption in the plaintiff's favor applies with less 22 force, et cetera. But you have an Australian plaintiff 23 suing in the United States based on shares purchased in 24 Australia and the lead defendant is the Australian bank. 25 So what -- what did you mean when you were
9 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 referring to Sinochem and forum non conveniens? 2 MR. DUBBS: We meant two things, Your Honor. 3 The first thing we meant was that, in addition to the 4 other tests that are proposed, putting Sinochem at the 5 beginning of the train would sort out some of these 6 questions in general. That's in general. 7 As to our particular case, we believe we 8 would win a forum non conveniens argument, though one 9 was never made and that was not explored by any district 10 judge. And we would win that because the statute 11 specifically provides in section 10(b) that fraud can be 12 caused in any number of ways -- three ways, including 13 through the mails, through foreign or interstate 14 commerce, or over an exchange. And that fraud was 15 caused in Florida and the mails were used and it was in 16 foreign or interstate commerce. 17 And the people who committed the fraud on a 18 nuts-and-bolts level are the senior management who are 19 defendants from HomeSide bank in Florida, so to that 20 extent it is a Florida case. And we also think that any 21 district judge in looking at a forum non motion would 22 also look at the various interests of National Australia 23 Bank in HomeSide in the United States to judge the 24 overall fairness of letting the suit proceed against 25 them and to counter the issue that this is really all
10 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 about Australia. 2 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, wouldn't your clients 3 have an adequate remedy under Australian law in 4 Australia, in the Australian court system? 5 MR. DUBBS: We might or we might not. But 6 that is not determinative. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let's assume that - 8 that they do not. Let's assume that on the facts of 9 this case they could not prevail under Australian law in 10 the Australian court system. Then what United States 11 interest is there - 12 MR. DUBBS: There - 13 JUSTICE ALITO: -- that should override 14 that? 15 MR. DUBBS: There is a strong United States 16 interest. It's on two levels. The first strong United 17 States -- United States interest deals with the conduct 18 at issue here, namely the conduct in Florida by 19 HomeSide. This was the sixth largest mortgage service 20 provider in the United States. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If we had only HomeSide's 22 conduct, nothing else, there wouldn't be any violation 23 of 10(b); is that right? 24 MR. DUBBS: We do not agree with that, Your 25 Honor. We believe that they made a representation by
11 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 creating the false numbers, or otherwise it's within the 2 scope of the statute. What they did is create a 3 deceptive device - 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But nothing has happened. 5 Suppose it had been caught by the Australian bank, and 6 they didn't act on it? 7 MR. DUBBS: Your -- Your Honor, that goes to 8 a different element of the cause of action. That 9 doesn't go to the scope of the statute. That goes to 10 how the private cause of action is enforced. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, I concede your 12 argument that a big component of this fraud was what 13 went on in Florida, but it needed to be disclosed to the 14 public. It needed to be put out there. And that wasn't 15 done in Florida by the Florida defendants. 16 MR. DUBBS: It was done in Australia and we 17 can prove that. And -- the point is we are not -- all 18 we are proving through doing that is the effects of the 19 fraud in Florida. To use Professor Beale's example, 20 where you have poison candy in one jurisdiction, that 21 poison candy is sent to another jurisdiction, and in the 22 first jurisdiction there is a law that says "thou shalt 23 not make poison candy;" through the exercise of 24 legislative jurisdiction that statute in the first 25 jurisdiction is appropriate, and both jurisdictions have
12 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 an interest in that. 2 Now, if we are in the poison candy 3 jurisdiction and we are bringing a case about poison 4 candy, if the statute in addition says, "you have to 5 show some harm from the poison candy," indeed you might 6 as a matter of proof have to show effects from that 7 other forum. But that's different than regulating 8 conduct in the second forum or anything else in the 9 second forum. That is simply looking at the statute or 10 the legal prescription against making poison candy. And 11 we say section 10(b) is like the poison candy statute. 12 JUSTICE ALITO: Which of your standards - 13 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's -- I would like 14 you to follow that up specifically. That is, in my mind 15 the difficult issue in this case is not the 16 jurisdictional issue under principles of international 17 law. It's the question of the scope of the statute. 18 And there the things against you are three. One is 19 Professor Sachs's argument, which I would like to know 20 your answer to. The second is in Judge Friendly's two 21 opinions. 22 The first opinion -- the second one, rather, 23 Bersch, he says if you had a foreign exchange and 24 foreign plaintiffs as -- and there was no foreign 25 plaintiff, the security issued over a foreign exchange,
13 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 even if that fraud takes place totally in the United 2 States, the statute wouldn't cover it. That's Friendly, 3 which started this. 4 And the third thing is what he says in 5 Leasco. He says: We cannot see any sound reason for 6 not taking your position, at least for the plaintiffs 7 who are Americans. Okay? 8 Now, France, Britain and Australia have 9 filed briefs in this case giving what they consider very 10 sound reasons, which are reasons that Judge Friendly 11 never considered. And those three reasons, as we know, 12 is they point to a number of conflicts, that if you win, 13 how that will interfere with their efforts to regulate 14 their own securities markets, right? 15 That's all one question: Professor Sachs, 16 Friendly in Bersch, and Friendly in Leasco. But that's 17 what I'd like to hear your answer to. 18 MR. DUBBS: I will try to keep the subparts 19 in mind. Why don't we start from the end and try to 20 work backwards. Perhaps one of the most important parts 21 of the record is the Solicitor General's view that as a 22 general matter -- and I will get to the specifics; I'm 23 not ducking that. But as a general matter the 24 enforcement of the securities laws, unlike the antitrust 25 laws, has not historically and today they do not believe
14 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 runs -- raises a substantial risk of interstate 2 conflict. 3 Now, as to the specific briefs that Your 4 Honor referenced, if we look at those briefs and we look 5 at those compared to what happened in Hartford Fire, 6 those briefs -- and let's focus on Australia's for the 7 moment because that's the country we are talking about. 8 Australia's brief essentially says they have a 9 regulatory system that may -- that we may or may not 10 have been able to litigate this cause of action in 11 Australia, but let's assume that we could. 12 They are not saying -- they did not say in 13 that brief that there was some fundamental conflict, 14 like the plurality found in Hartford Fire; nor did they 15 say that there was the kind of conflict that comes up in 16 the application of 403(h) of the Restatement, which 17 Justice Scalia looked to in his opinion in Hartford 18 Fire. So there is not the kind of conflict that leads 19 necessarily -- necessarily -- to not reasonably applying 20 the statute. 21 The reason there's not is that because, one, 22 there is not a rule in Australia that one has to abide 23 by and a rule in the United States that one has to abide 24 by that are contradictory. At most, what you have is 25 you have a clear rule in the United States that says
15 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 thou shalt not commit fraud in Florida through either 2 the Florida through either -- for or in interstate 3 commerce, the mails or through an exchange. And on the 4 other side of the equation what you have is maybe they 5 could have brought suit over here and we have a robust 6 regulatory system and a robust litigation system; more 7 power to them. 8 But that doesn't mean -- saying that, that 9 doesn't mean that the first State where the poison candy 10 was made suddenly has no interest in that. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but -- but Australia 12 says: Look, it's up to us to decide whether there has 13 been a misrepresentation, point one; and whether it's 14 been relied upon by the -- by the plaintiffs, point two. 15 And we should be able to decide that and we don't want 16 it decided by a foreign court. 17 You are talking about a misrepresentation, 18 if there was one in this case, made in Australia to 19 Australian purchasers; it ought to be up to us to decide 20 that issue; and here you are dragging the American 21 courts into it. 22 MR. DUBBS: Well, let me deal with the 23 dragging in part in a minute, because that's 24 subliminally very important to the case. 25 But let me address the direct question. He
16 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Australians may believe that, but the question is was 2 there a misrepresentation both in the United States and 3 possibly in Australia? If there was in Australia, 4 that's for the Australians. That's dealing with the 5 effects of eating the poison candy. But we say a 6 misrepresentation was made in the United States - 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not to these plaintiffs. 8 MR. DUBBS: Sir - 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you have to join the 10 misrepresentation to the plaintiff. 11 MR. DUBBS: We have joined - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: The only misrepresentation 13 to these plaintiffs was made in Australia by an 14 Australian company. 15 MR. DUBBS: There are two ways to connect 16 the fraud to the plaintiffs. The one is the "in 17 connection with" requirement that deals with conduct, 18 which we meet, and this Court has construed very broadly 19 in Dabit, in Zandford and any other number of cases. 20 That's number one. 21 Number two, assuming that the scope of the 22 statute is broad enough to cover the conduct in Florida, 23 we then get to the second question, which is the 24 reasonableness of the application of the statute, and 25 without a conflict, we would then look at -- to the
17 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 interest of the United States and compare them to the 2 Australians. And the Australians can say, we can -- you 3 know, we can go after eating that poison candy. And we 4 say, fine, if you want to, that's great. But that 5 doesn't mean we can't go after the act of poisoning the 6 candy in Florida. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- that isn't the 8 issue. The -- the -- the issue for the Australians is: 9 We want to determine whether there has been a 10 misrepresentation or not. 11 MR. DUBBS: They - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't want the 13 determination of whether there has been a 14 misrepresentation on the Australian exchange and whether 15 Australian purchasers relied upon that misrepresentation 16 to be determined by an American court. 17 MR. DUBBS: And we say more power to you, 18 you can decide that question. The question - 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not if it's decided here, 20 unless you want to say, the Australian court to say, the 21 United States taking this case is so outrageous that we 22 will not respect its judgment. And that's a factor, 23 too. It's -- what conflict of laws is all about is you 24 have two jurisdictions, both with an interest in 25 applying their own law, but sometimes one defers to the
18 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 other. 2 MR. DUBBS: That's correct, Your Honor. And 3 the question is should there be deferral in this case. 4 And we say if you apply the standards of -- of Hartford 5 Fire or the standards of the Restatement, you don't end 6 up in deferral. You end up in prosecution of the 7 Section 10(b) cause of action in Florida. And you do 8 that for a couple of different reasons. 9 First, you look at the magnitude of the 10 conduct in Florida, the size of this. This is a 11 $1.75 billion writedown in a portfolio. You have a 12 portfolio of $187 billion worth of mortgages sitting 13 down in Jacksonville, Florida. Those are all mortgages 14 on American homes, 2 million American homes. So, this 15 is not just Australia, Australia, Australia. That's 16 what's in the portfolio and that's what's being 17 misrepresented. And when they doctor the numbers and 18 send them to Australia, it's a misrepresentation of 19 that. 20 In addition, you have the overarching 21 consideration of is it appropriate to sue National 22 Australia Bank in the United States at -- at a -- at a 23 more abstract level? And the answer to that, we submit, 24 is yes. They have invested -- if you care to look, it's 25 on the SA-11 and SA-41 of the supplemental appendix,
19 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 they have invest -- they have $25 billion worth of 2 assets here. They own a bank in Michigan, they have a 3 huge trading operation on Park Avenue that trades 4 billions of dollars in derivatives every day. This is 5 not the situation -- this is not the stereotype of a 6 gotcha where you have - 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those derivatives 8 are not at issue here, right? 9 MR. DUBBS: Well, they are only - 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I presume -- I'm 11 sorry, go ahead. 12 MR. DUBBS: They are only at issue in the 13 following sense, which is that the position on the 14 mortgage servicing rights was hedged in New York. When 15 the hedge came undone, there were losses in New York on 16 the other side of the hedge. That goes to the point of 17 were there any affects in the United States, because 18 there seems to be some confusion on that. There were 19 some effects here from the hedge. There were some 20 effects on -- in the ADR market, but we are not -- we 21 are not - 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Morrison - 23 MR. DUBBS: -- disputing that most of the 24 effects were over there. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dubbs, Morrison, the
20 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 first-named plaintiff, was a derivative holder. 2 MR. DUBBS: No, Your Honor. He was the 3 holder of an ADR. The derivatives come in because they 4 are the activity in New York that is the other side of 5 the transaction. HomeSide - 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But do you have -- you 7 have two classes of plaintiffs, one the Australians, who 8 bought their shares in Australia; then you have 9 Morrison, who has an ADR, and who is dismissed because 10 he wasn't able to show damages. 11 MR. DUBBS: That's true. There -- there are 12 no Americans left. This is strictly Australians. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what U.S. investor was 14 harmed? 15 MR. DUBBS: The -- the question is, were 16 there effects on the U.S. market? There were U.S. 17 investors who were, in all likelihood, harmed but none 18 have stepped forward with respect to ADR holders. But 19 if the question in the abstract is were there economic 20 effects from this transaction in the United States, the 21 answer is -- is yes, there were fallout from -- on -- on 22 the derivative side, which is the other side -- which 23 was the other side, in effect, the short side of what 24 the long position was, which was $187 billion worth of 25 mortgages in Florida that what is -- what the portfolio
21 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 consisted of. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you -- do you want 3 to finish? 4 MR. DUBBS: No, Your Honor. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Then -- I mean, I can see. 6 I will give you all that. That isn't what is bothering 7 me. I think you are right so far as what you have 8 argued. But the part that I think is most difficult is 9 why I -- I shorthand referred to Professor Sachs' 10 article. 11 MR. DUBBS: Yes. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Because what Australia is 13 actually saying is what we don't like about -- about the 14 American system, you know, their -- their common 15 criticisms of class actions. We say, first of all, the 16 American rule means even if our companies here are 17 right, that they are going to have to pay their legal 18 fees. We don't like punitive damages. We don't like 19 that we have the opt-out. And these are all our 20 citizens, and we don't want to subject our companies on 21 our exchange to that stuff. 22 Now, fine, they have a reason on their side. 23 Then Professor Sachs says: Read the statute, because 24 they argue -- it was never intended to cover that kind 25 of stuff. Now, that's what I would like you to address
22 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 specifically. 2 MR. DUBBS: Well, it was -- there are two 3 issues. The statute was intended to cover that kind of 4 stuff if the antecedent of "stuff" is fraud in Florida. 5 Now, that's a separate question from how we deal with 6 the private right of action in these circumstances. 7 Now, let's back up. The general criticism 8 of these cases is that they are gotcha cases. You put 9 in a little bit and all of a sudden the private bar 10 comes and attacks you. I mean, that's the stereotype. 11 Well, the stereotype is wrong and it's important to 12 understand why the stereotype is wrong. Because if all 13 you have is a very modest investment in the ADR market, 14 1 percent like my friends from NAB, those cases get 15 bounced at the beginning on personal jurisdiction as 16 they did in the district of New Jersey in SCORS and the 17 Novagold case. We are not aware of any case where if 18 all you've got is that little toehold that you stay in. 19 You get bounced by -- on personal jurisdiction. 20 And to pick up on the discussion that I was 21 having with Justice Ginsburg, we thought that in 22 addition to that, if the Court wanted to send signals 23 with respect to these kinds of cases, if you put, as you 24 can, Sinochem at the beginning of the train, even more 25 of these cases if they are fallacious are going to be
23 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 screened out of the system. 2 So, the point is that we can all tell our 3 Australian friends that there are very rigid safeguards 4 in place so that this horror story in reality doesn't 5 happen and it has not been proven to happen. It is an 6 attractive myth, but it hasn't happened. Those cases go 7 out and they go out early. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure that it 9 happens in advance of considerable discovery. I -- I -10 I would agree that the judge can confine discovery to 11 forum non conveniens or for personal jurisdiction, but 12 in -- in these cases one of the things we are really 13 talking about is the burden of discovery. That's the 14 cost of litigation. You know that. 15 MR. DUBBS: I do know that and let me answer 16 briefly, because I want to reserve my time for rebuttal. 17 I disagree with your fundamental observation, Justice 18 Kennedy. These cases are paid attention to by the 19 district judges and they go out early. They go out 20 early on personal jurisdiction; there is not a lot of 21 discovery on that. They go out early -- if Sinochem 22 gets applied faithfully, it would go out early on that 23 if there is a close question. And then you go to the 24 12(b)(6). 25 And pursuant to the Private Securities

1 Litigation Reform Act, one of the purposes of that is no 2 discovery, no discovery until after the motion to 3 dismiss is decided. 4 So it is not true that there is a lot of 5 discovery, there is a lot of transaction costs, before 6 we know the answer to one of the threshold questions, 7 which is: Should this case be in our system or not? 8 That can be handled and it is being handled on a daily 9 basis, notwithstanding, you know, some stereotypes. 10 Now, my final point with respect to 11 Professor Sachs' articles and some of the other articles 12 is they in effect -- if they advocate a rule, which many 13 of them do, which it should be limited to exchanges, 14 that goes back to my threshold point of the scope of the 15 statute. And it takes an eraser to the statute and it 16 says: It's only exchanges; it's not in connection with 17 foreign or interstate commerce or through the mails; 18 it's limited, contrary to the express words of the 19 statute, in a way that the statutory construction we 20 don't believe can stand it. 21 Now, there are other legitimate ways of 22 cabining the private cause of action. But that -- if 23 you are faithful to the statute, we submit that is not 24 one of them. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

1 Mr. Dubbs. 2 Mr. Conway. 3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE T. CONWAY, III, 4 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 5 MR. CONWAY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 6 and may it please the Court: 7 The judgment of the court of appeals should 8 be affirmed for two reasons. 9 First, Petitioners have identified nothing 10 in the text of section 10(b) that overcomes the 11 presumption against extraterritoriality or the Charming 12 Betsy Rule. The statutes should thus be construed not 13 to apply to transactions and shares of foreign issuers 14 on foreign exchanges. 15 Second, unlike the rights of action that 16 this Court has addressed in other extraterritoriality 17 cases, the section 10(b) right is purely implied. 18 Congress didn't intend for this right of action to exist 19 even domestically, let alone extraterritorially. 20 Given the threat that the section 10(b} 21 implied right presents to the sovereign authority of 22 other nations, as reflected in the amicus briefs of 23 Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and the 24 diplomatic note from the Swiss government, the Court 25 should construe the implied right not to extend to
26 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 claims of purchasers and sellers of securities of 2 foreign issuers on foreign markets. 3 The two clear statement rules are, 4 obviously, the presumption against extraterritoriality 5 and the Charming Betsy Rule require that the Congress. 6 Both require an affirmative intention of the Congress 7 clearly expressed before the statute can be applied to 8 apply to foreign transactions or to, you know, matters 9 that it infringes on the sovereign authority on other 10 nations. 11 My friends don't identify anything in the 12 statute that comets even close to a clear statement. 13 They principally rely on the definition of "interstate 14 commerce," but as this court said in Aramco, that kind 15 of boilerplate simply doesn't suffice to overcome the 16 presumption against extraterritoriality. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what is your test for 18 whether -- whether it's being applied internationally or 19 not? 20 MR. CONWAY: Well, our test is that, at a 21 minimum, section 10b should be held not to apply to 22 transactions involving shares of foreign issues on 23 foreign exchanges, because that presents the greatest 24 danger of conflict of foreign law, particularly in the 25 context of the modern section 10b implied right, which
27 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 has the fraud on the market presumption and holds 2 issuers liable, as here for example, for two and a half 3 years of trading, all on an Australian exchange. That 4 is massive transfer of wealth that the Petitioners here 5 are seeking an American court to effect, and that is - 6 basically, it's a direct form of market regulation that 7 Australia has not seen fit to impose upon itself. 8 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you on that 9 point: Supposing the class of plaintiffs included a 10 group of Americans who were shareholders of the 11 Australian bank and who -- but who purchased their stock 12 over the Australian exchange. 13 MR. CONWAY: We would -- well, we would 14 submit that that rule should be the same. That they 15 should -- they should not also, they should not be 16 allowed to sue under section 10b. They -- they -- you 17 know, those people chose to purchase on the Australian 18 exchange. And in terms of the threat to international 19 comity, I think it would be probably take -- I don't 20 think other countries would take nicely to a -- to a 21 rule of law that would allow Americans, essentially, to 22 bring their rules, their law, their remedies, fraud, on 23 the market, what have you to foreign countries - 24 JUSTICE BREYER: Give me reasons for it. 25 The strongest one for it, the strongest example against
28 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 you it seems to me, is Judge Friendly's example. 2 Schmidt, a citizen of Germany, flies to New York and 3 meets Jones in the hotel. And Jones says, I have a 4 bridge I want to sell you. Look out the window. Say, 5 Do you own the Brooklyn Bridge? Yes. And that's a lie. 6 Here's what you do. You invest in buying 7 shares of my company sold on the German exchange. Okay? 8 MR. CONWAY: Yes. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Conduct took place in the 10 United States, a terrible fraud. This is contrary to 11 fraud and, says, I think, Judge Friendly and others, it 12 should apply at least where Schmidt is an American 13 citizen and Professor Sachs says no, not even then. 14 What do you do with that case? The fraud 15 took place totally here. 16 MR. CONWAY: Well, I disagree with that, 17 Your Honor, I think the fraud is carried out when the 18 transaction occurs in a foreign country. But I do agree 19 that Professor Sachs is absolutely right - 20 JUSTICE BREYER: Sign the paper here in New 21 York. 22 MR. CONWAY: Yes. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Sign the paper, right here, 24 and give me the money, because I have an urgent 25 appointment.

1 MR. CONWAY: Yes, sir. 2 (Laughter.) 3 MR. CONWAY: That's a much different case, 4 obviously, than the fraud in the market case that we 5 have here. But Your Honor, yes, that is a stronger 6 circumstance. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but your position and 8 hers is: That's no more a valid claim than this one or 9 any other one we dream up. That's why it's a pure 10 example, and I want to know how you feel about it. 11 And - 12 MR. CONWAY: Well, I think that -- I think 13 the problem is, in order to have that conduct swept 14 within the statute, you have to ignore the language and 15 the presumption against extraterritoriality. 16 If you go to petition appendix 78, that has 17 its text in section 10b, and section 10b refers to the 18 use or employment of any manipulative device or 19 contrivance, and it's in connection with the purchase or 20 sale of any security registered on a national securities 21 exchange. And that's - 22 JUSTICE BREYER: Or any other. Or -- read 23 the next word. 24 MR. CONWAY: That's correct. Any security 25 not so registered. And this Court has held -- it has
30 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 held in cases like Aramco, American Banana, Moritson, 2 that the words "any" and "every," words of universal 3 scope, do not -- do not mean that these -- that 4 something referred to is anything, anywhere else in the 5 world. And for example, the Court is small against the 6 United States. In the case where the presumption of 7 extraterritoriality didn't really apply the court held 8 that in a statute, you normally assume that things being 9 referred to are thing in the United States. Now - 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the government going to 11 tell us that its test, which differs from the foreign 12 exchange test, is based on considerations like those 13 suggested in Justice Breyer's Brooklyn Bridge 14 hypothetical? 15 MR. CONWAY: I think they do. I think they 16 look to -- I think their view is that the statute is 17 vague and you have to do essentially what Judge Friendly 18 did and the Seventh Circuit did for many years, is you 19 have to make do and decide what the best rule is. And 20 with respect to the government, that is essentially 21 doing what this Court has said under the presumption 22 against extraterritoriality the Court shouldn't do. 23 That's essentially legislating, trying to figure out 24 what Congress would have done, had "a particular 25 problem" -

CONWAY: Your Honor, I think the problem 8 with the government's test and with the Second Circuit's 9 test, is that it would still allow the application of 10 U.S. law in a manner that would infringe the sovereign 11 authority of other nations. 12 And I can give an example. There was a case 13 over the summer that the Petitioners attached to their 14 first supplemental brief on the petition for certiorari. 15 And it's a case called PC shifts. And it's an 16 interesting case because it involved a Canadian company 17 with headquarters in Britain and most of whose shares 18 traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 19 And what happened there was that the 20 CEO spent time in Florida -- it was a shipping company. 21 We spent time in, Miami running the show from Miami. 22 And the court of appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in a 23 ruling that it held was consistent with the Second 24 Circuit decision in this case held that nonetheless, the 25 application of U.S. law could be applied to transactions

1 of -- of foreign plaintiffs on the Toronto Stock 2 Exchange. 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it a consideration that 4 this discovery alone would be an offense to foreign - 5 MR. CONWAY: Yes, discovery alone. Yes, 6 Your Honor. Discovery alone. I think the French brief, 7 for example, points that out. I think a number of the 8 brief -- there have been blocking statutes that have 9 been enacted by various countries because of the -- what 10 they deem to be the offensive scope of discovery. In 11 France, you are really only allowed to obtain evidence 12 that is actually admissible in trial. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure how you 14 interpret the language that you -- that you just read, 15 when you say to use or employ in connection with the 16 purchase or sale of any security registered on the 17 National Security Exchange or any security not so 18 registered. 19 Now, is it your point that in order to avoid 20 an international extension of it, it should apply only 21 to securities? What? 22 MR. CONWAY: It should only be applied - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Securities purchased and 24 sold in the United States? Is that it? 25 MR. CONWAY: That -- that's correct, Your

1 Honor. I think that's a fair reading of the statute. 2 And this Court is required, under both the presumption 3 against extraterritoriality under its decision and the 4 Charming Betsy Rule to interpret a statute, take the 5 permissible construction of the statute that is least 6 likely to result in an extraterritorial of the law. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Purchased -- purchased or 8 sold? 9 MR. CONWAY: Purposed or sold, Your Honor. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if it's not -- what if 11 it -- what if the fraud produces neither a purchase or a 12 sale but induces somebody to hold on to stock that 13 otherwise the person would dispose of? 14 MR. CONWAY: Well, I -- I don't know that 15 that would state a claim, a private claim under Blue 16 Chip Stamps. And any -- and if the share or the 17 securities are held abroad, if it's a foreign security, 18 and I think the liability in that hypothetical -- I'm 19 assuming that if it's a foreign security held by a 20 foreigner -- that really would be something that would 21 be subject to foreign law, whether or not Australia 22 wants to represent -- recognize holder claims of the 23 sort that this Court rejected in Blue Chip Stamps. 24 That's a question for Australia to decide. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under these same
34 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 facts if you had -- altering according to the 2 hypothetical, you had U.S. plaintiffs who purchased 3 National Australia Bank ADRs on the New York exchange, 4 you don't doubt that they can sue, do you? 5 MR. CONWAY: No, and in fact, we told the 6 district court, we did not move to defense on 7 extraterritoriality grounds the claims of Mr. Morrison, 8 who inexplicably is still here. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 10 MR. CONWAY: We argued that Mr. Morrison's 11 claims should be defeated on the grounds that he had no 12 damages, which was an absolutely ironclad calculation 13 best based on a -- on a provision of the PSLRA, and we 14 also argued that all of the claims should be dismissed 15 for failure to plead fraud with the requisite 16 particularity of the PSLRA. 17 But we certainly do not dispute that when a 18 company like ours registers shares on -- registers 19 shares with the SEC, ADRs with its SEC and lists them on 20 a New York stock exchange, it's subjecting itself to New 21 York -- I mean, U.S. law for purposes of those - 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And presumably that 23 would impose the same discovery on the bank as the 24 Sudanese case. 25 MR. CONWAY: It could, Your Honor, that's
35 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 absolutely true. But on the other hand, I mean, a lot 2 of the other aspects of -- of this litigation, which 3 this Court has, you know, noted that is potentially 4 highly vexatious, I mean, that is only 1.1 percent of 5 the flow -- of the total equity securities of the -- the 6 National Australia Bank. So the dangers of -- of a 7 threat of -- of coerced settlements is much, much less. 8 It's a much, much easier case to deal with 9 if -- if -- if you are only dealing with the ADRs. Now 10 if another company decides to list half its equity on 11 the New York Stock Exchange, well, it can -- it makes 12 the determination for itself, how much of this kind of 13 litigation it wants to subject itself to. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose there were 15 litigation with substantial allegations of wire fraud 16 violations as predicate for RICO violations, and the 17 case begins to proceed, and then there is a second cause 18 of action under the securities law. Would -- would the 19 fact that there is going to be discovery and substantial 20 litigation in the -- in the United States courts be a 21 factor in retaining the -- the securities violation in 22 this suit? Or would the test be just the same in your 23 view? 24 MR. CONWAY: I think the -- I think you have 25 to take each statute separately. You have to look at
36 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 what the language of the statute says, whether it -- it 2 admits fault in an extraterritorial reading, and whether 3 that -- frankly whether that extraterritorial reading is 4 required or compelled. If there is any other possible 5 construction, as the Court said in -- in Charming Betsy, 6 the court is required to accept that construction, 7 accept the construction that doesn't result in 8 extraterritorial application or doesn't result in - 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: On the -- on the 10 extraterritorial presumption against it, your colleague 11 on the other side tells us that in all the cases where 12 the presumption applied, all of the conduct was 13 someplace else, and they give the Aramco case and say 14 that was an employee hired in -- was it Saudi Arabia - 15 MR. CONWAY: That - 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and everything 17 happened outside the country. 18 MR. CONWAY: Well, my - 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Here, I mean, you have to 20 concede that a component of the alleged fraud occurred 21 in Florida. 22 MR. CONWAY: We do concede that some of the 23 conduct that ultimately, you know, led -- in a but-for 24 causal relationship to what happened in the Australia 25 occurred in the United States, but that's true in a lot
37 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of other cases. For example, Aramco, Mr. Boureslan was 2 hired in Houston. So was the cook in Foley Brothers v. 3 Filardo. And in Microsoft v. AT&T, basically all of the 4 conduct, the relevant conduct was in the United States, 5 because what the -- what section 271(f) proscribed in 6 Microsoft was the shipment -- the supply in or from the 7 United States of a component of a patented invention. 8 And what this Court held in Microsoft was 9 that notwithstanding AT&T's argument that, "Hey, the 10 presumption against extraterritoriality doesn't really 11 apply because this is just regulating the supply in and 12 from the United States," this Court held that the 13 presumption against extraterritoriality applied because 14 what would happen is, a single act of supply would 15 result in a springboard for liability each time a -- a 16 disk was put into a computer abroad. 17 And that is exactly analogous to the 18 circumstances in this case, where what we -- what 19 happened was some -- some allegedly false information 20 was transmitted to Australia; it was then republished in 21 annual reports, print, print, print; sent out to the - 22 sent out to the Australian market, and resulted in - 23 allegedly, as they would have it -- resulted in 24 liability every single time somebody purchased - 25 purchased a share of stock of the National Australia
38 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Bank on the Australian securities exchange. And so that 2 is exactly analogous to -- to Microsoft v. AT&T. 3 Again, another point I think that's relevant 4 is the, section 30 of the Exchange Act. Congress did 5 not make a clear statement in section 10. It did make 6 clear statements in section 30. Section 30(a) addresses 7 transactions on foreign exchanges. Section 30 as a 8 whole is entitled Foreign Exchanges, and section 30(a) 9 makes it -- makes -- gives the SEC power to promulgate 10 regulations that -- that apply to brokers and dealers 11 who effect transactions of securities on foreign 12 exchanges, if those transactions are transactions of 13 shares of shares of U.S. issuers. 14 And that's at -- for reference, the text of 15 section 30 is at page 19 of the law professors' brief. 16 And section 30(b) also, it says that the SEC can 17 regulate the -- regulate businesses in securities of - 18 of businesses -- securities that are abroad, but only to 19 the extent the SEC finds it necessary to prevent evasion 20 of the Act domestically. 21 And so Congress made two clear statements in 22 section 30. It did not make any clear statement in 23 section 10. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, is that your only 25 point? Or is your point also that you wouldn't need
39 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 section 30 if -- if 10(b) were - 2 MR. CONWAY: That's - 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- were read as broadly. 4 MR. CONWAY: That's absolutely right. The 5 reading -- my friend's reading of section 30 would 6 render section 10(b) -- I mean the reading of section 7 10(b) would render section 30 superfluous. And there 8 are other provisions of -- that are in the Exchange Act 9 where Congress has made clear statements to show that it 10 can make clear statements. Section 30A which 11 immediately follows section 30, is the Foreign Corrupt 12 Practices Act. 13 So Congress -- if Congress -- if there is a 14 loophole, and that's what this Court said in Microsoft 15 v. AT&T; if there is some kind of loophole that presents 16 some kind of a problem, that Congress needs to fix, 17 Congress can do it. Congress can do it with a clear 18 statement. 19 In sum, Your Honors, countries -- nations of 20 the world do things differently. They -- they -- they 21 have different rules of liability. We see in the amicus 22 briefs different rules of materiality, different rules 23 of disclosure. And some rely on -- on public 24 enforcement more than others. 25 The French rely on l'action publique, as
40 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 they say; and some nations approach ours in their 2 generosity to plaintiffs. Australia allows opt-out 3 class actions; so does Canada. Canada allows opt-out 4 class actions; it dispenses with, for example, the proof 5 of reliance, it dispenses with scienter in some cases. 6 Yet it -- it does all that, but it restricts liability 7 to $1 million or 5 percent of a -- of a company's - 8 JUSTICE BREYER: How does it hurt the other 9 countries if what we would say on their reading of this 10 is, Congress has said, "Look, if some terribly bad 11 conduct happens in the United States; they lie through 12 their teeth; and you, whoever you are in the world, who 13 buys some shares and as a result you are hurt, we will 14 give you a remedy. Come to us" -- now, how does that 15 hurt Australia? 16 MR. CONWAY: Well, it hurts Australia - 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Or France or England or any 18 of these others? 19 MR. CONWAY: Exactly the same way this Court 20 said it hurts in Empagran. In Empagran this Court noted 21 that -- that a reading of the rule that would allow -- a 22 reading of the FTAIA that would have allowed foreign 23 plaintiffs to come and sue for -- for foreign vitamins 24 transaction in a foreign country would essentially allow 25 plaintiffs to avoid the -- the narrower rules of the
41 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 liability and the narrower remedies that other nations 2 provide. And that is exactly true here, where, you 3 know, for example, Australia does not permit 4 fraud-on-the-market class actions. It doesn't allow - 5 it doesn't recognize the fraud-on-the-market 6 presumption. 7 And as I said, for example, Canada restricts 8 these actions, it has generous liability rules and 9 allows opt-out class actions, but it says -- it caps 10 damages at 5 percent of an issuer's market 11 capitalization or $1 million, whichever is greater. 12 And so that's the -- that is the problem. 13 It's not just substance but it's remedy. Other nations 14 want to do things in different ways; they should be 15 allowed to. What is going on here is essentially a -16 Brandeising -- experiment a global scale. And that's a 17 good thing. 18 It's a good thing because it enables 19 countries to judge for themselves what kind of rules 20 they want to have for people who buy shares on their own 21 exchanges. And to apply section 10(b) it cases like 22 this would cut that experiment short. It would amount 23 to exactly the soft of legal imperialism that this Court 24 rejected, rightly, in Empagran. The Court should reject 25 it here as well and it should affirm the judgment of the

ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 This case presents two distinct questions: 12 First whether the fraud alleged by Petitioners violated 13 Section 10b; and second, whether Petitioners may bring a 14 private action. 15 In our view, the alleged fraud violated 16 Section 10b, because significant conduct material to the 17 fraud's success occurred in the United States. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There are -- there 19 are a lot of moving parts in that test. You know, 20 significant conduct, material, you require it to have a 21 direct causal relationship. Doesn't the complication of 22 that kind of defeat the whole purpose? 23 MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor, we don't think 24 so. In terms of the -- of the direct cause part, which 25 it will be -- the significant limit on private actions,
43 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 as this case illustrates, the district courts even 2 accepting the allegations in the plaintiff's complaint 3 will often be able to dismiss the suit on the pleading 4 for its failure to satisfy that test. It's not a 5 difficult test - 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's only for the 7 private companies? 8 MR. ROBERTS: That's right. And in terms of 9 the other test, again, I don't think it's that 10 complicated.

ROBERTS: If -- if -- the critical 17 question is whether there's significant conduct here 18 that's material to the broad success. And the reason 19 for that is if Section 10b didn't cover that kind of 20 conduct, then that would risk allowing the United States 21 to become a base for orchestrating securities frauds for 22 export.

What's bothering me, taking off from what the 22 Chief Justice said, is the feasibility of your test. 23 Your test, it seems to me on causation, would say that 24 when you phone Schmidt and lie to him, he can sue. But 25 when you phone your parent company, knowing that they

1 in Australia reviewed the numbers that were sent from 2 Florida to any degree, they just directly copied them, 3 some low-level clerk directly copied them, would the 4 direct cause test be met? 5 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, if the action was just 6 ministerial over overseas, it would -- it would be met. 7 Again, the critical question, in our view, under the 8 direct cause test is, was there culpable conduct in the 9 United States that is directly responsible for the 10 plaintiff's injury? 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts - 12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then you give no 13 weight to the fact that it was on the Australian 14 exchange? 15 MR. ROBERTS: The -- the fact that the 16 transaction happens on the Australian exchange is not 17 dispositive, because if -- if somebody in the United 18 States is directly -- is -- is executing the fraud -- if 19 it turned on just a transaction on the Australian 20 exchange, then a domestic investor could be injured by a 21 fraud that is hatched entirely here that is executed 22 entirely here, and he is tricked into executing a 23 transaction on an overseas exchange. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, because your 25 time is running out, there is a basic question here.

1 You are asking us to make a distinction between what the 2 SEC can sue for and what a private party can sue for. 3 Congress did that with respect to aiders and abettors. 4 Is there any other instance in which we have 5 made a distinction, yes, the SEC has a claim but the 6 private litigant doesn't? 7 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, the -- the -- the private 8 litigants are -- have numerous elements that they have 9 to show that the SEC doesn't have to show: Reliance, 10 loss, loss causation. All of those go to the causal 11 link between the injury and -- and the fraud. And we 12 think that the direct injury requirement is an 13 appropriate application of those more general causation 14 requirements in the context of transnational fraud. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: I am frankly less concerned 16 with your -- your test for the private cause of action, 17 the direct cause test -- I -- I guess I could work with 18 that -- than I am with your test for -- for the 19 jurisdiction of the -- of the SEC, which is sort of a 20 totality of the circumstances test. It doesn't seem to 21 me that's an appropriate test for a jurisdictional 22 question. You don't want to spend time litigating the 23 totality of the circumstances. 24 MR. ROBERTS: We don't think it's a -- a 25 jurisdictional question in the sense of the subject

1 matter jurisdiction, Your Honor. It's a -- a test about 2 the scope of the statutory coverage. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, okay. 4 MR. ROBERTS: And it's true that bright line 5 rules -- it's true that bright line rules are easier to 6 administer, but the -- there is a danger in bright line 7 rules for fraud prohibitions because they can provide a 8 road map for evasion of the statute. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any 10 indication that our friends around the world are 11 comfortable with your test? 12 MR. ROBERTS: Well, the briefs that have 13 been filed by Australia and United Kingdom and France 14 are limited to the private right of action. They base 15 their -- what they want to do is to limit the private 16 rights. And I think the United Kingdom brief 17 specifically says that -- it thinks that SEC action 18 could be appropriate here, and that's a reason why, if 19 the Court adopts the -- a limit on the private actions, 20 that it need not -- it need not be concerned about the 21 possibility that -- that fraud would be launched in the 22 United States or directed in the United States and it 23 couldn't be addressed. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess we don't have to 25 say anything about -- about what the government can do,
50 Alderson Reporting Company

1 do we? 2 MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor. And we would 3 certainly prefer that you decided the case solely on the 4 private right of action if the alternative for a holding 5 substantive prohibitions didn't apply here. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Roberts, you 7 urge deference to the SEC's interpretation in 8 administrative adjudications? 9 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have anything 11 other than those two proceedings over the last 35 years? 12 MR. ROBERTS: Those are the two 13 administrative adjudications. The SEC's administrative 14 adjudicatory authority is limited to people involved in 15 the securities industry, and a lot of these frauds that 16 happen are -- don't involve people that are registered 17 broker/dealers and the like. There are numerous Civil 18 Actions that the SEC has brought where it has taken the 19 same approach. The SEC v. Berger case that we cite in 20 our brief is one of them. 21 I can name some others. There is 22 SEC v. Wolfson, which is a case that's in the district 23 court in Utah, and SEC v. Shay in -- in the southern 24 district of New York. SEC v. Banger in the northern 25 district of Illinois. Those involve international

1 boiler-room schemes of the kind I was alluding to 2 before, where masterminds in the United States basically 3 direct agents that they have got in countries like 4 Thailand or Spain to -- to make false statements and 5 engage in high-pressure selling to target investors in 6 other countries. Sometimes they induce them to engage 7 in transactions in still other countries. So - 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 9 Mr. Roberts. 10 Mr. Dubbs, you have three minutes remaining. 11 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A. DUBBS 12 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 13 MR. DUBBS: Thank you, Your Honor. Let me 14 begin with Justice Alito's question, and I promise to 15 get back to Judge Friendly and the Brooklyn Bridge. 16 As to -- we have alleged that in -- that 17 effectively, ministerial activities did occur here. The 18 Second Circuit held, interpreting our complaint, that 19 the numbers were mechanically incorporated. That's as 20 close to ministerial as you get. 21 We used, in the complaint, the were 22 "adopted." We said that they were asleep at the wheel. 23 The meaning is the same, but the -- there were no 24 checkpoints. The checkpoints are illusory. If there 25 was a checkpoint, the guard was asleep at the
52 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 checkpoint, and the MSR number went right through the 2 checkpoint. Those are the allegations, and we should be 3 able to stick with the allegations. 4 Now, turning to the statute, my colleague 5 indicated that the language with respect to foreign and 6 interstate commerce and so on, based on the Aramco 7 decision, was boilerplate. That's wrong. In this 8 statute, those specific statutory approaches towards 9 stopping fraud are in the substance of the statute. 10 They are not in the jurisdictional statute. That's 11 important. That's why that's different. 12 As to the Leasco example and Bersch example, 13 what Leasco shows is a long chain of causation, because 14 Leasco involved an American, not a foreigner, which was 15 very important under Judge Friendly's typology. And in 16 Leasco, you have this extended line of causation 17 beginning with representations in the United States 18 about a friendly, tender offer. Then there was a phone 19 call, maybe in London, maybe in the United States, and 20 then there was a command by Saul Steinberg to his 21 investment bankers: Go into the London Stock Exchange 22 and start to buy. 23 That extended line of causation would not 24 pass muster under the direct cause test. The direct 25 cause test as this Court is using it in the RICO area
53 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 under cases like Hemi, that would not pass muster. What 2 that shows, and Judge Friendly said that if you have a 3 foreign Plaintiff, the direct cause is appropriate, that 4 shows that the direct cause test is narrower, it's a 5 screening device, and it limits the possibilities when 6 you have a foreign Plaintiff. 7 Now, that is a proper way to cabin the 8 private cause of action. Taking an eraser to the 9 statute and saying: The only words that count are on an 10 exchange, doesn't do it if you are going to keep a 11 linkage between the private cause of action and the 12 expressed words of the statute. If that can't do it, 13 what are the other tools? And the other tools are the 14 direct cause test, and this Court has been very ably 15 working through some of these difficult fact patterns in 16 the RICO area. 17 Now, in this case, there is not the problem 18 that there is in Hemi; there is not the intervening 19 cause. You have a related party, NAB, that may or may 20 not be involved that allegedly is broken -- breaking the 21 chain of causation. It is -- has to be, under that 22 doctrine, a totally third party, as it was in Hemi, 23 where you have the State of New York, the City of New 24 York and had all these bouncing balls going back and 25 forth. This is a straight shot between that MSR being

1 fabricated in Florida and going on to the financial 2 statements. There is no intervening cause. 3 And even if we assume that in some senses, 4 it was normal to look at those financial statements, 5 that in and of -- of itself has failed. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 7 The case is submitted. 8 (Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the 9 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
