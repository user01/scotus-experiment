    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a case of inventive statutory interpretation by the Ninth Circuit. The statute at issue directs the courts how to construe this act or any other provision of law, yet the Ninth Circuit interpreted the statute rather inventively as an exemption from a provision of the Constitution. The statute protects California statutes and regulations regarding two aspects of California's composition regulation of packaged fluid milk, yet the Ninth Circuit interpreted the statute, rather inventively, as an exemption for all aspects of California's economic regulation of raw milk. Inventiveness may have a role to play in some cases of statutory interpretation, but not when the governing legal standard requires that Congress has made its intent unmistakably clear. The Ninth Circuit's statutory holding should be reversed. There is also a constitutional issue before the Court involving the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article 4. The Ninth Circuit should be reversed on that issue as well, but not because it was overly inventive. The Ninth Circuit simply ignored, with no explanation at all, binding precedent from this Court requiring that courts look beyond the face of the statute to determine whether, in practical effect, it draws a distinction based on citizenship or residency. The California statutes and regulations at issue in this case draw a distinction based on where milk is produced, and 93 percent of dairy farmers live on their farms. To draw a distinction based on the State of production is, in effect, to draw a distinction based on the State of residency, and the distinction should be subject to scrutiny under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. We do not --"

    "speech": "A -- a husband and wife, Darrel and Diane Kuiper, yes. Let me return to the statutory issue. This act or any other provision of law in section 144 means statutory or regulatory law, not the Constitution. Why do I say that? Number 1, section 144 is phrased as a directive to courts about how to construe particular bodies of law. Congress doesn't have the power to tell courts how to construe the Constitution. It does have the power to tell courts how to construe congressional silence or inaction, and the McCarran-Ferguson Act is a good example of the kind of phraseology Congress uses when it wants to enact a Commerce Clause exemption, but section 144 is a poor candidate from the outset. Number 2, the canons of construction applied in numerous decisions of this Court, most recently the Keffler case in February, required that a general phrase like, other provision of law, be construed by reference to the phrases that came before. Federal statutory and regulatory law is naturally paired with this act, but would be very odd to throw the Constitution in as an afterthought through use of the phrase, other provision of law. Number 3, the legislative history is devastating to respondents' position. The absence of a single reference to the Constitution anywhere in the legislative history is quite significant, but it's not the strongest refutation of respondents' argument in the legislative history. Rather, the very first paragraph of explanation of section 144 in the conference report describes it as, quote, an exemption from the preemption provisions of any Federal law respecting standards of identity and labeling for fluid milk, close quote. That can be found on page 33 of the blue brief. Number 4, and this is merely the clincher that builds on the first three points, the standard is whether Congress has been unmistakably clear in passing a Commerce Clause exemption. The evidence is so strongly the other way that one might call it unmistakably clear that Congress did not pass a Commerce Clause exemption, but it --"

Our own submission is that the 84 years since Chalker was decided have strengthened its underpinnings a great deal, rather than undermining them. The Camden case from 1984 reinforces Chalker by rejecting a formalistic approach to the threshold question of discrimination, and the Lunding case from just 5 years ago stresses the concern with, quote, practical effect, close quote, in this Court's Privileges and Immunities Clause jurisprudence. There's just nothing to justify the Ninth Circuit's disregard of this Court's cases. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Very well, Mr. Englert. Ms. McDowell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL MS. McDOWELL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 144 does not indicate with unmistakable clarity that Congress meant to exempt from the Commerce Clause any California laws, much less to exempt the particular raw milk pooling regulations at issue here. Indeed, section 144 is most naturally read as protecting only a narrow set of California's fluid milk composition and labeling laws from invalidation only under Federal statutes and regulations, not under the Constitution. First, Congress did not state or even imply that the Commerce Clause is among the provisions of law from which section 144 provides protection. Section 144 directs how those provisions of law shall be construed, and Congress ordinarily does not direct this Court and the lower Federal courts how to construe the Constitution, and under the canon that general words are known by their more specific companions, the words, any other provision of law is understood to refer to the preceding words, this act, to refer only to Federal statutes and regulations implementing them. Section -- second, section 144 protects only California laws regarding two specifically defined subjects, the percentage of milk solids, and solid not -- solids not fat in fluid milk products sold at retail, and the labeling of those products. The laws challenged here do not concern either subject. They instead concern how California handlers account to the California equalization pool for purchases of out-of-State raw milk which may or may not ultimately be processed into fluid milk products subject to the composition and labeling requirements."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Ms. McDowell, as to the exemption from the National -- from the Nutrition and Labeling Act, is this -- is this a special exemption that California has, or do a number of States have congressional exemptions from the Nutrition and Labeling Act? MS. McDOWELL: Well, this specific provision, section 144, applies only to California."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, but are there similar exemptions in -- in effect in other States? MS. McDOWELL: Well, the Nutrition and Labeling Act does contain an exemption for maple syrup composition and labeling that might have been designed to benefit the particular States where maple syrup is produced. I'm not aware of the particular background of that provision. There's also an adjoining provision of the 1996 Farm Bill that provides further indication that Congress didn't intend section 144 to apply to all of the pricing and pooling laws. That's section 143(b) on page 17 of the joint appendix, which authorizes the promulgation of a Federal milk marketing order for California if California dairy farmers approve of one. Such a Federal milk marketing order would have contained its own separate Federal pricing and pooling provisions. It would necessarily have superseded the California pricing and pooling provisions at issue here. It seems unlikely that Congress intended in section 144 to preserve the very pricing and pooling laws that section 143(b) and the Federal marketing order would supersede. The legislative history reinforces --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But there -- but there was no -- but there is no Federal marketing order that supersedes it, or am I wrong there? MS. McDOWELL: No, it authorized the promulgation of one if California dairy farmers approved. California dairy farmers have not asked for a Federal marketing order at this point. Under a Federal marketing order, by the way, handlers are required to treat milk from sources inside and outside the marketing order, marketing area similarly, so the same minimum pricing requirements that would apply to a dairy farmer within the marketing area would also apply if milk came in from -- from outside that area."

    "speech": "Oh, I -- I see. In other words it would have to be a California marketing order treating Nevada milk, not -- not a Nevada marketing order saying what happens when you go to California.

Of course, Federal milk marketing orders aren't subject to the constraints of the Commerce Clause, as are the California orders."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Has Congress ever provided a -- an exemption for anything that looks like this California pricing and pooling scheme? MS. McDOWELL: Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor. And this is a particularly unusual Commerce Clause exemption because it does benefit only one State. It seems particularly appropriate in that circumstance to apply the clear statement rules and -- and to require an affirmative indication that Congress wanted to allow California and only California to burden out-of-State interests."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I thought the only thing Congress had ever -- maybe there's something else. I thought it was only insurance that Congress had performed the extraordinary act of waiving the Commerce Clause. Isn't that right? MS. McDOWELL: That's certainly one of the most familiar instances of this --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It's the only one I -- only one I know of. Is there another one? MS. McDOWELL: There are other instances in which Congress has affirmatively authorized particular action by States. For example, the Northeast Bancorp case involved a -- an authorization for States to essentially discriminate against interstate commerce to prohibit acquisitions of local banks by out-of-State holding companies, and when Congress enacts an affirmative authorization one would think that then Congress is removing any impediments that Congress can remove from State regulation, but that's not the forum of the provision at issue here. Rather, it applies only to this act and other provisions of law which are naturally understood to be Federal statutes and regulations. With respect to the Privileges and Immunities Clause, we agree that the court of appeals erred in suggesting that a statute can violate that clause only if it discriminates on its face based on citizenship and -- or residency. In Chalker, the Court recognized that a statute could also violate that clause if it discriminates based on some factor closely related to citizenship, such as the location of a person's chief business office. The distinction drawn by the California regulations are somewhat similar. The lower courts didn't consider whether that distinction is closely enough related to State citizenship to implicate the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Accordingly, we would ask that the judgment of the Ninth Circuit be reversed with respect to both the Commerce Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause question, and that the case be remanded."

California is unique, however, in, to the extent that it has its own freestanding marketing program and, of course --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And my other question is, do you -- does the Government think we have to reach the Privilege and Immunities issue to decide the case? MS. McDOWELL: Well, the Court granted certiorari on the Privileges and Immunities question. It's a narrow question. Ultimately, on remand, the Privileges and Immunities claim may not have to be decided because a ruling in petitioners' favor on the Commerce Clause issue would provide them all of the relief that they're seeking."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And it wouldn't take care of the -- the ruling on the statute would take care of everything, but not Privileges and Immunities, because that covers only individual persons, not corporations. MS. McDOWELL: That's correct. What we're saying is that the entire case needs to be remanded for consideration of the Commerce Clause claim on the merits, as well as the Privileges and Immunities Clause claim, and if the Commerce Clause question is decided in petitioner's favor, all of the petitioners would benefit from that ruling, so there might not be occasion to consider the Privileges and Immunities Clause as well.

As regards the first step, it is unmistakably clear that Congress in adopting section 7254 intended to provide a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption for at least California's milk content and labeling laws.

If they wanted to limit the scope of the protection of section 7254 merely to preempt, they wouldn't have added two additional phrases, and in addition to that, many of the preemption savings statutes use the term, this act or other -- any other act of Congress, or lists a set of acts or regulations. They don't simply have the statement of one act and then a -- a general term like, any other provision of law."
  },

I mean, we don't have any other examples of where -- unless it was the -- the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which -- which we did not uphold."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "URBAN",
    "speech": "That's -- that's correct, Your Honor. There's two ways that Congress can act to save State laws. One is by a preemption savings statute, and the other is by a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption. And beyond that, Congress can't affect the State exercise of authority through any means that involves the Constitution, and that, the -- the first question then is, does section 7254 create a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption. And then, as I indicated, the choice really is, is it preemption only or something more and the statute itself, by using the terms, prohibit or otherwise limit, suggests that it is, or states directly that it is something more. If they just simply wanted to have this as a preemption savings statute they would have stopped at preemption. And again, the argument was raised, well, why didn't they mention the Constitution directly. None of the two areas where there have been cases in which the Court has found a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption, one of which is the McCarran-Ferguson Act and the other of which is the Northeast Bancorp case, was there mention of the Constitution. They -- they looked at -- at the total, at what the statute said, at what the context was in which those statutes were adopted, and -- and from that concluded that Congress had intended to fully regulate in those areas or to provide a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption. The petitioners have tried to use a doctrine of adjustum generis, the laws are interpreted in the company they keep. I've never seen an application of that doctrine where all you have is one statute or one item mentioned, and then you say any others. Usually that doctrine's applied when you have three or four items."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Urban, the problem, as I see it, is not whether they -- you might construe the language as broad enough to cover the Dormant Commerce Clause, but the thing it saves is, legislation regarding milk solids and fats and so forth, and doesn't say anything about saving pricing legislation."

  {
    "speaker": "URBAN",
    "speech": "Your Honor, as a general matter, you can have composition and labeling laws without a pricing scheme. California's composition standards are unique because they require fortification. That produces several features. One is that there's not a ready market to sell into California with complying milk. If you didn't have pricing and pooling laws and you went back to the free market, you'd be subject to the same boom-bust cycle that led to the creation of these pricing and pooling laws in the first place, and when you'd reached the point where the prices were very high and supplies were low, I think the -- the inevitable result of that would be that the composition standards would be undone and they'd simply revert to the Federal standards."

They'd really get angry, and this time, though they don't get angry at the $18 price, they'd start really shipping milk in from Arizona, and once they shipped in milk from Arizona, maybe that wouldn't have the fortified stuff in it and they'd -- they'd amend the law so that you could bring it in from Arizona and down would go the labeling requirement as it stands today.

I mean, if we have to write this, as I understand it, and I'd just as soon you correct, because I don't want to say something if it isn't right. This is actually a simple system, it's not so complicated, and at the heart of it is simply, we could pretend that they want to pay the dairy $16 a hundredweight indefinitely. That's stable. And now the problem is, although you can say to everybody, pay, a handler is paid $16, when they do that they're going to discover cheese coming in from Wisconsin, and the cheesemakers are not going to be able to compete and still pay $16, so they figured out in California, here's how we keep our cheesemakers in business. We subsidize them. We pay them $2 because they can only sell at $14. Where do we get the money from? We get it from the milk sellers. So they pay $18 to pay the cheesemakers $14 so that all can pay $16 to the dairies. That way, the cheesemakers stay in business despite Wisconsin, and the milk sellers, unfortunately the retailers have to charge more and the mothers have to pay more for their milk, but that in a way helps the people who want to eat a lot of cheese. We don't know what happens to them if they eat too much cheese, but -- (Laughter.)"

    "speaker": "URBAN",

What there was was then a blending when you come to the producers of their revenues, and that's the pool, and that blending of revenues, they adopted a two-tiered system. One was a quota system, and one was all other prices, and that really was set up because the quota-holders had contracts and commercial dealings with class 1 dealers which -- for which they got a higher price, and the goal was to protect those -- those rights and reflect those rights in the difference between a quota price and an everything-else price."

One is of regulation versus nonregulation. I want to go into the legislative history of section 7254, which was mentioned. When section 7254 was adopted, the Federal law NLEA preempted California milk content standards, but that law only applied to fluid milk in interstate commerce. The House conference committee report which petitioners cite not only described the preemption issue, but it also said that the purpose of adoption of 7254 was to allow California to fully enforce and apply its -- its standards. It would have made little sense, in light of that congressional intent, for Congress to on the one hand allow for a exemption from preemption but at the same time allowed the exact same body of law to be subject to a Dormant Commerce Clause challenge, which is, in fact, what happened in the Shamrock case, yet that would occur, that undermining of Congress' intent to have California be able to fully enforce its own milk content standards, if section 7254 were held to be only a preemption savings statute. We've touched on the issue of the scope of section 7254, and we're not claiming that the unmistakably clear standard applies to the scope, and we're certainly not claiming that it's unmistakably clear that section 7254 applies separately to pricing and pooling laws. What we're claiming is that section 7254 not only covers the laws themselves, but the means to keep those laws in effect, and in answer to questions --"

Benjamin, but then when the Court's come back, for example, in Royal Drug to look at what's the business of insurance, they've used standard -- you've used standard rules of -- of statutory construction. And you know, that -- that makes a certain amount of sense here, because you know, you have both a preemption savings statute and a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption in the same statute, which is the case -- if you have a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption you'd have to essentially have two sets of rules as to how you interpret the, what is being affected by that -- that exemption, one for preemption and one for a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption. That -- that doesn't -- doesn't seem logical. They should -- whatever Congress intended be covered by the law should be interpreted the same, whether it's a Commerce Clause exemption or a preemption exemption. The second issue before the Court is the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and when this issue was considered by the Ninth Circuit they ruled that because the out-of-State dairy producers were not being regulated based on their residency, but that the regulatory scheme involved place of production, that the -- that the Privileges and Immunities Clause didn't apply. That is fairly unexceptional, because the purpose of the Privilege and Immunities Clause is that it applies when a State law deprives a nonresident who enters a State to engage in some protective privilege, that they're entitled to the same privilege and immunities as a resident of that State. There's no entry into the State by -- by the dairy farmers from Arizona -- if they came into the State to produce milk, they'd be treated exactly the same as --"

    "speech": "Well, that's what the Court did in New England Power Company v. New Hampshire, and the statute being construed, the provision of the Federal Power Act being construed in that case, like the statute being construed in this case, was not so much a preemption clause as an unpreemption clause. The typical statute that comes before this Court alleged to be a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption is one that says certain State laws are protected, or are allowed, and in many of those cases the Court has said, and New England Power v. New Hampshire is a good example, the Court has often said yes, those State laws are not subject to preemption under Federal law, but there is no unmistakably clear Dormant Commerce Clause exemption. So the -- the Court's jurisprudence as I read it is really rather consistent in setting a higher standard for exemptions for the Dormant Commerce Clause, and there's a reason for that, and the reason for that is that the Commerce Clause is part of the -- is one of the structural provisions of the Constitution and, as this Court pointed out in the South-Central Timber case, the particularly strong rule of construction ensures that all States know what's going on and have their say in Congress before the protections the States have vis-a-vis one or another -- vis-a-vis one another are altered."

What the judge was saying is, wait a minute, there -- there's no -- nobody here could say they're -- they're discriminating on the basis of residency or citizenship. That's not what the statute says. It's discriminating on the basis of where the milk is produced. We don't care if he's a California resident or a -- or an Alaska resident, it's where the milk is produced, and there's nothing in the statute as I read it, says the judge, i.e. on its face, that says anything to the contrary.

    "speech": "-- exemption, and with respect to the Privileges and Immunities Clause on the ground that location is not the same as residency or citizenship, and we need not look behind location of production to ask whether it is so closely correlated with residency or citizenship as to create an improper -- a classification that must be scrutinized under the Constitution. Mr. Urban pointed out that the McCarran-Ferguson Act uses the verb construe, and rightly so, but what it says the Court is not to construe as forbidding State regulation is Congress' silence. It is not a directive how to construe the Constitution. It is a very proper statute, perhaps the model for how a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption should be written. Don't construe our silence to mean we want to stop the States from doing something. The statute here is very different. The statute here says, construe this act or any other provision of law in particular ways. Mr. Urban, in talking about section 7254, said at one point, the use of three different verbs, only one of which is preempts, suggests that Congress' intent was something more than merely to negate Federal preemption. I respectfully submit that suggesting that Congress had more in mind is not enough to meet the unmistakable clarity standard. Under Gregory v. Ashcroft, an unmistakable clarity standard means it would be plain to anyone reading the act what Congress had in mind, and merely saying the use of three verbs suggests something does not make it plain to anyone reading the act. I do think -- Justice Stevens asked Ms. McDowell if the Court needs to reach the Privileges and Immunities Clause claim. I -- I believe the Court does need to reach the Privileges and Immunities Clause claim in the limited way we have suggested and that is because, although Ms. McDowell correctly said the petitioners might prevail on remand under the Commerce Clause and, indeed, I hope we will, and if we do that will give all of my clients the relief that they need, we also might not prevail under the Commerce Clause, and I think we're entitled to pursue both the Commerce Clause claim and, with respect to the individual petitioners, the Privileges and Immunities Clause claim on remand. The -- Justice Kennedy asked me some questions in my opening argument about the Federal marketing orders in effect in Nevada and Arizona, and I -- I perhaps didn't speak with sufficient clarity about two aspects of that. The Federal milk marketing orders cover parts of Nevada but not other parts. Some are and some are not covered by Federal milk marketing orders, but in any event, it's worth making clear that the marketing orders fundamentally operate on the processors of milk, not on the producers of milk, so when we say the Federal milk marketing orders operate in parts of Nevada, we're really talking about Nevada processors. If you ship your milk to a California processor it -- it is at no point governed by a Federal milk marketing order. Whatever -- with respect to the unmistakably clear standard, Mr. Urban made the argument that once you've found an unmistakably clear Dormant Commerce Clause exemption, the unmistakably clear standard has no more role to play and it's just a matter of ordinary statutory interpretation. This Court's cases, I believe, do not support that proposition, but he spoke specifically about the McCarran-Ferguson Act cases in which the Court has construed the phrase, business of insurance, without any particular thumb on the scale. Well, that is how the Court must construe the phrase, business of insurance, because Congress has delegated authority over an entire business to the States. That's very different from this very precisely drawn statute that speaks about two particular aspects of California's compositional regulation of raw milk and saying, well, let's just resort to ordinary principles of statutory interpretation to determine whether that also reaches economic regulation of fluid milk. The unmistakably clear standard is still in effect, and ingenious arguments about the relationship between economic regulation of fluid milk and composition regulation of raw milk are not enough to meet that standard. In particular, it cannot possibly be the case that the 1997 amendments to California's pooling plan are somehow necessary to effect composition regulation. The main thing the 1997 amendments did was not negate the possibility that out-of-State milk would flood California to such an extent that there would be price effects that ultimately would have -- would have sanitary effects. What the 1997 amendments did essentially was say, we're going to intercept some of the revenue that would otherwise go to out-of-State processors at California's border and redistribute it just to in-State interests. We're going to take some of the money that they would otherwise get in their milk transaction and say, it must go to Californians, not to you out-of-Staters. That's the essence of the Commerce Clause violation in this case, and it's also inconceivable that that kind of regulation could be protected by this statute. If that kind of regulation is protected by this statute, then a regulation that says 100 percent of every milk check that would be written to a Nevadan must instead go to a Californian is protected by this statute, i.e., no out-of-State milk, and that can't possibly be the unmistakably clear intent of Congress in section 7254. One last detail, and it is just a detail. Mr. Urban said that 10 to 15 percent of the milk that comes into California is from out of State. I understand from a publication that's cited at page 39 of our opening brief called Dairy Profit Weekly that the actual number is closer to 3 percent. When Congressman Bill Thomas spoke at a field hearing -- thank you."
