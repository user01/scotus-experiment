3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Case 1410154, Voisine and

5 Armstrong v. United States.

6             Ms. Villa.

7            ORAL ARGUMENT OF VIRGINIA G. VILLA

8               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS,

9                  APPOINTED BY THIS COURT

10             MS. VILLA:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11 please the Court:

12             There are three reasons to exclude reckless

13 misdemeanors from the phrase "use... of physical force"

14 as occurs in 921(a)(33).

15             The first is that it's consistent with the

16 definition of use that this Court has implemented in

17 other cases.  Second, it is consistent with the

18 commonlaw definition of battery.  And, third, it is

19 consistent with the intentionality inherent in domestic

20 violence.

21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's inconsistent

22 with the treatment of bodily injury.  I mean, I think

23 you agree, because the Court so held, that either bodily

24 injury or offensive touching is the act  satisfies the

25 act requirement.  And you say if there's bodily injury,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 then reckless is enough, but if it's only offensive

4

2 touching, then you need a higher mental state,

3 intentional or knowing?  Why  if  if both acts

4 qualify equally, why shouldn't the same state of mind

5 attach to each?

6             MS. VILLA:  The same state of mind should

7 attach to each, and that is why intentionality is the

8 state of mind that under the common law can attach to

9 each.  Because intentional battery covered both the

10 offensive physical contact as well as the physical

11 injury, whereas recklessness covers only bodily injury.

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.

13 Intentionality, in my mind, is misperceived, because you

14 think  you're talking about intentionality as the act

15 of causing the injury.  But I understood commonlaw

16 battery to be the intentional act that causes the

17 injury; i.e., if a husband threw a bottle at a wife,

18 doesn't intend to hit her, but the bottle smashes

19 against the wall and the glass embeds itself in her

20 face, under the common law that would have been a

21 battery because the act, the intentional act, was to

22 throw the bottle.  It wasn't  it wasn't to cause the

23 injury, but the act caused the injury.

24             MS. VILLA:  I respectfully disagree, Your

25 Honor.  Under 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know.  If we end up

5

2 disagreeing because the government points to many

3 examples where this is the case, how do you win?

4             MS. VILLA:  That's only on injury cases, and

5 so you don't have that same confirmation or that same

6 organization of the law with respect to offensive

7 physical contact.  And so my clients were convicted of

8 offensive physical contact under a  under the

9 categorical approach.  And so at that point, you can't

10 say that they were convicted of anything that caused

11 physical injury.

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But  but the point is

13 that the contact was in  was  some contact had to

14 have occurred.

15             MS. VILLA:  Correct.

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The question is whether

17 there was an act that caused that contact regardless of

18 whether it was intentional or reckless.

19             MS. VILLA:  The problem under the common law

20 is that not all touches were considered to be illegal.

21 And so that is why in Johnson, this Court stated the

22 common law as being the intentional application of

23 unlawful force.

24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, we were talking

25 about commonlaw battery as it applied to  definition

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 as it applied in a domestic setting.  So I'm talking

6

2 only about a domestic setting 

3             MS. VILLA:  This 

4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   which this is.

5             MS. VILLA:  This is serious but the problem

6 is, is that the government's formulation of any reckless

7 conduct satisfying use of physical force is that it's

8 not limited to batteries.

9             JUSTICE ALITO:  But the mens rea of

10 recklessness could apply to the act of touching or to

11 whether the act is offensive.  Now, under Maine law, to

12 which of those does it apply?  It doesn't necessarily

13 have to apply to both.

14             MS. VILLA:  Statutorily it does apply to

15 both.

16             JUSTICE ALITO:  So if someone recklessly

17 touches another person and that is offensive, that's a

18 battery under Maine law?

19             MS. VILLA:  Yes, Your Honor.  And the

20 government cites a case exactly for that  proposition,

21 and that's the Gantnier case.

22             JUSTICE ALITO:  And what happened in that

23 case?

24             MS. VILLA:  It was whether the defendant got

25 a  an instruction on the simple battery rather than

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the sexual offensive contact, and so that the Court

7

2 reversed it because it said that it was a proper

3 instruction.

4             JUSTICE ALITO:  No, I mean what were the

5 facts?  What did this person do that was  involved a

6 reckless touching?

7             MS. VILLA:  He went to wake in  his

8 stepdaughter, I believe, who was asleep on a couch,

9 reached underneath a blanket and  to shake her awake,

10 and touched her naked body.

11             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that  that seems

12 like the recklessness there goes to the  the offensive

13 nature of the touching, not to the touching itself.

14             MS. VILLA:  No.

15             JUSTICE ALITO:  In other words, there's the

16 act of touching, so he  he went to shake her but he

17 didn't intend to touch her?

18             MS. VILLA:  It was  there can be

19 recklessness as to result or recklessness as to

20 circumstance.  And so that is an example of recklessness

21 as to circumstance by reaching underneath.  If he had

22 touched her on top of clothing, it would not have been

23 the same offense that could have been charged.  And so

24 it was the fact that he touched her naked body and could

25 not see that she was naked.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't really understand

8

2 the  the answer.  He didn't intend to touch her at

3 all?  That was his intent?

4             MS. VILLA:  No, he did intend to touch her.

5             JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  Well, that's what I'm

6 saying.  They are two different things.  Did the  does

7 the person intend to touch  does the person intend to

8 touch in an offensive way?

9             MS. VILLA:  Correct.

10             JUSTICE ALITO:  And so then it seems like

11 your answer to my question is that it is in the latter

12 that has the mens rea of recklessness.

13             MS. VILLA:  Under the Maine statute, it is

14 the latter that has the mens rea of recklessness.  Under

15 the common law, it is the intent to have unlawful

16 contact.  And so that is why not all touches qualify,

17 which is why you can't just have an intent to touch.

18 You also have to have an intent to touch unlawfully.

19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I 

20             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is it that indicates

21 that the Federal statute tracks the common law?  The

22 Federal statute gives its own definition.

23             MS. VILLA:  Your Honor, the Federal statute

24 is the use of physical force, and so it is only because

25 of Castleman having adopted the common law for purposes

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
9 1 of force.  But Your Honor is absolutely correct, that we 2 are not construing the common law here.  We are 3 construing the phrase "use... of physical force."  And 4 the problem with the government's case is that that use 5 of physical force can occur in reckless driving context. 6 If I am driving a car and I have a family member that 7 qualifies under 922  921(a)(33) in with me and I get 8 into an accident due to reckless conduct, that would 9 qualify as a predicate under this statute according to 10 the government's construction. 11             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Villa, can I understand 12 what you said?  You said you're relying primarily, then, 13 not on the commonlaw history but on the  the  just 14 the language, "use... of physical force" and what that 15 means, the ordinary meaning of those words, is that 16 correct? 17             MS. VILLA:  The Court has to deal with the 18 ordinary meaning of those words.  The Court can take  19 from the common law, it can take from many places, but 20 the ordinary mean of use is to carry out an action or 21 purpose by means of.  In Castleman itself  22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why isn't  any of 23 these examples that people give about the reckless 24 behavior?  Why  why couldn't that be a use of force? 25 I mean, Justice Sotomayor said throwing a plate against
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1 a wall.  You say, well, I have a better example.  It's 2 driving a car really fast in a way that will endanger 3 all the inhabitants.  But, of course, we've said a 4 number of times  I mean, we said it most recently in 5 the Sykes case that a car is  is an instrument of 6 force when used recklessly in that way.  So why aren't 7 all of these kinds of examples consistent with the 8 ordinary meaning of use of force? 9             MS. VILLA:  There's a substantive 10 difference, though, between driving recklessly and not 11 intending to harm the person that is with you in the car 12 and throwing an object at a person.  And so, really, the 13 example of throwing an object at a person is that 14 intentional use of force against that other person. 15 That defendant can testify all day and all night that I 16 didn't intend to  17             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Of course, you're  you're 18 adding language to the statute now because you said 19 against another person, and that is indeed the language 20 in Leocal.  But in Leocal, we said we're not going to 21 decide the question here, which is just the phrase "use 22 of physical force," not against another person, just the 23 phrase, "use... of physical force." 24             And tell me  I mean, I guess your car 25 example doesn't move me very much, so see if you can
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 give me an example which would be reckless behavior

11

2 under a battery statute but which you think would not

3 involve the use of force.

4             MS. VILLA:  I had a client once who pled

5 guilty to a misdemeanor where he was actually running

6 away from a guy who was trying to beat him up.  And he

7 closed the door very forcefully behind him and caught

8 the guy's fingers in the  in the door.

9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  You just said it.  He closed

10 the door very forcefully behind him.

11             MS. VILLA:  He did.

12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's the  that's the use

13 of physical force.

14             MS. VILLA:  It was the use of physical

15 force.  But what he explained is that, I closed the

16 door.  The door hit the guy.  I didn't mean to hit the

17 guy.  I knew he was behind me.

18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I know.  And that's why it's

19 reckless and not knowing or whatever the other term is.

20 But  but you're still using physical force.  And

21 that's the  that's the term that has to be interpreted

22 here, is the "use... of physical force."

23             MS. VILLA:  But the Court has said, with all

24 due respect, that it is to  carrying out an action or

25 purpose by means of force.  The  my client closing the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
12 1 door, he didn't mean to hurt the other guy.  He meant to 2 close the door.  And so he was using force to close the 3 door, but he wasn't using force to hurt the other guy. 4             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, quite right.  But the 5 language  I feel like I'm repeating myself a little, 6 so I'll just try it one more time.  The language is just 7 the use of force.  And what we are trying to decide is 8 whether that includes use of force that indeed is 9 carried out without an intent to harm, but is carried 10 out with an understanding that there is a risk of harm. 11 That's what recklessness is.  And  and, you know, 12 doing something like driving a car 200 miles an hour, or 13 throwing a plate, or slamming a door when somebody's 14 hand is in the vicinity, all of those things involve the 15 requisite risk and all of those things involve the use 16 of physical force. 17             MS. VILLA:  But not in the sense that the 18 Court has construed "use" in the past.  And so they have 19 in  for instance, in Smith, which was decided in 1993, 20 that case was where it was "to carry out an action or 21 purpose by means of."  And so it's not to carry out an 22 action, to close a door, by means of hurting somebody. 23 And so there is this disconnect, and that is inherent 24 because in the  in recklessness, because what you're 25 doing is that you aren't looking to hurt it.  There may
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 be a risk, but that's not your purpose.

13

2             And so the  the whole difference between

3 purposeful, knowing behavior as opposed to reckless

4 behavior is  is that you have a purpose that is

5 pointed someplace else with a risk that there might be a

6 collateral consequence, rather than actually seeking to

7 accomplish that collateral consequence.

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Don't you have to look

9 at this in the domestic violence context?  Because the

10 definition, "use of force" as put in terms of a

11 misdemeanor under Federal or State triable law, means 

12 so it means a domestic violence.  And isn't it

13 prototypical in many of these domestic violence cases

14 where much of the violence employed is not direct

15 violence, not hitting some  there's a lot of that, but

16 there's an awful lot of the examples I raised of

17 reckless conduct that leads to violence, either from

18 drunkenness or from other conditions.

19             You're using "use of force" as it's being

20 defined in other areas.  Why does it fit into this

21 domestic violence case?

22             MS. VILLA:  Because domestic violence,

23 according to the Castleman opinion was violence or

24 nonviolent conduct that's offensive, and is offensive 

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the offensive

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 touching prong.  That has nothing 

14

2             MS. VILLA:  Excuse me?

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That was the offensive

4 touching prong.  I'm talking about, here, the use of

5 physical force prong 

6             MS. VILLA:  Except for 

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   that causes injury in

8 some way.

9             MS. VILLA:  But it's a singular definition.

10 It's "use... of physical force."  Whether it is touching

11 or not, it is something that is intended to control

12 one's partner.  And so if you have to use force to

13 control one's partner, or you do something that is

14 offensive to control one's partner, it is still the idea

15 that you are implementing any level of force in order to

16 achieve an end, and that end is the control inherent in

17 domestic violence.

18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The government tells us

19 that this is  heavy consequences ride on this, that

20 is, that many domestic violence situations would not be

21 subject to prosecution under this statute on your read,

22 if you require knowing or intentional, rather than

23 reckless, state of mind.

24             MS. VILLA:  Yes, Your Honor.

25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you agree with that?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
15 1             MS. VILLA:  I don't necessarily agree with 2 that.  The reason I don't is because, as was noted in 3 footnote 8, courts have generally construed "use... of 4 physical force" to exclude reckless conduct. 5             And so there are  for instance, in 6 Castleman itself, it falls in the Sixth Circuit.  The 7 Sixth Circuit in Portela held "use of physical force 8 excludes reckless conduct."  It was not construing 9 922(g), but I would note that the State prosecutor in 10 Castleman had a statute much like that in Maine that 11 disallowed knowing, purposeful, or reckless conduct. 12 And rather than charging all of them, that prosecutor 13 restricted it to "knowing purposeful conduct." 14             JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that 15 prosecutors, when they are State prosecutors, when they 16 are charging these domestic violence offenses, are going 17 to be looking ahead to the consequences of the 18 particular charge for Federal firearms laws? 19             MS. VILLA:  Yes, Your Honor. 20             JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that's 21 realistic? 22             MS. VILLA:  Yes, Your Honor.  And that is 23 because there is a large part of the budget of  for 24 domestic violence within the Federal government that 25 goes towards training and joint task force so that there
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
16 1 is an awareness on the part of State prosecutors exactly 2 for this purpose. 3             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me ask you this, 4 which is somewhat unrelated.  So Congress passes this 5 statute, and they do not want a person who has been 6 convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to 7 have a firearm.  Okay?  What was the year when that was 8 passed? 9             MS. VILLA:  1996, Your Honor. 10             JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  1996. 11             That's what they want to do.  And you agree 12 that a  that the offense of battery falls within that 13 definition; am I right? 14             MS. VILLA:  The offensive contact battery, 15 yes, Your Honor. 16             JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  What reason is 17 there to think that when Congress did this, they wanted 18 common law battery only?  They didn't want battery as it 19 is defined in general by a great many States. 20             MS. VILLA:  Because of the  21             JUSTICE ALITO:  At  at that time, am I 22 not  is it not correct that by that time a majority of 23 the States had battery offenses that reached reckless 24 conduct? 25             MS. VILLA:  You are correct that many States
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 did.  But the problem with that scenario as to what

17

2 Congress intended is that it did not adopt battery as

3 the definition of a misdemeanor crime of domestic

4 violence for purposes of 

5             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I under  I

6 understand that, but I thought you agree that "battery"

7 in some sense falls within the definite  falls within

8 the category of a misdemeanor crime of domestic

9 violence.

10             MS. VILLA:  I have to, because of the

11 Castleman so ruled.

12             JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, if you

13 agree with that  and then your argument is that they

14 just  all they think about across the street is the

15 common law.  So battery  common law battery, they

16 don't care what the actual statutes are around the

17 country.  They are just interested in the offense of

18 common law battery.

19             MS. VILLA:  Your Honor 

20             JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, is that realistic?

21             MS. VILLA:  Your Honor, that is not my

22 position.  My position is, is that common law battery,

23 offensive physical contact could only be accomplished

24 through intentional conduct.

25             The term "use" had been construed already by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 this Court prior to 1996 as being an affirmative,

18

2 purposeful conduct that you're taking an item and making

3 it your instrument, that you're accomplishing something

4 with that.  And in this case, it would have been force.

5             And so then if you accompany that with the

6 idea of domestic violence as the intentional controlling

7 of a domestic partner, all of those ideas, each one of

8 them has intentionality at its core.

9             And so that when Congress used this phrase

10 as an element, not as a  a generic crime of battery,

11 but as an element of any misdemeanor crime, it is the

12 intentional use of physical force, because

13 intentionality use, as well as physical force and

14 domestic violence, all share that.

15             JUSTICE ALITO:  I think you're losing me.  I

16 thought you were argue  I thought you were

17 acknowledging that reckless conduct would be sufficient

18 when it is  when physical injury as opposed to

19 offensive touching is involved; is that right or not?

20             MS. VILLA:  Under the common law in about

21 the mid 1800s, there was a subset of batteries that did

22 adopt a negligent  not a negligence, but a

23 recklessness factor.  But that is not the definition

24 given in Johnson, and it is not the definition 

25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was that  what was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that category?  That was the category where bodily

19

2 injury resulted; is that right?

3             MS. VILLA:  Yes, Your Honor.

4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So the answer to Justice

5 Alito's question is, yes, that bodily injury does

6 trigger this statute.

7             It's the question I opened with.  If the 

8 if the conduct is covered, whether it is touching or

9 bodily injury, why shouldn't the state of mind match?

10 Why shouldn't the same state of mind do for both bodily

11 injury and offensive touching?

12             MS. VILLA:  Because it would be inconsistent

13 with the idea that when you adopt a common law term,

14 that you adopt all of the soil that went with that

15 common 

16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, what's the common

17 law term?

18             MS. VILLA:  The common law term is the

19 "battery" term as informing force.  And so in

20 Castleman 

21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Excuse me.  Let me get the

22 statute.  The statute talks about "use."

23             MS. VILLA:  It is "use."

24             And so force was at issue in Castleman, and

25 that's where this Court identified the common law

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
20 1 battery  the level of force involved in a common law 2 battery as being the level of force for purposes of the 3 statute. 4             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But we wouldn't think that 5 the common law has some great definition of the word 6 "use," would we? 7             MS. VILLA:  No, Your Honor.  Which is why 8 that normal usage for use of physical force is the 9 intent  also intentional, and  10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah. 11             MS. VILLA:   so I'm just saying that  12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, I hear you today as 13 basically making an ordinary meaning argument, which I 14 think is a good thing because all the briefing on both 15 sides of this has been talking about the common law 16 until it's coming out of your ears, and it's not clear 17 to me why the common law makes any difference at all 18 here. 19             I mean, you know, Congress was operating 20 against a backdrop.  It was not the backdrop of the 21 common law; it was the backdrop of 50 States having 22 battery statutes.  There's no word in this statute which 23 is a defined  you know, which is a  a settled 24 commonlaw term. 25             So the question is, what was Congress doing?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Congress, we said in Castleman, wanted to basically

21

2 capture the set of battery statutes in which  which

3 were used for people engaged in domestic violence.

4 Almost all of those statutes use "recklessness" within

5 them.  Why isn't that the proper place to look rather

6 than the common law?

7             MS. VILLA:  Because Congress used a narrower

8 definition than many battery statutes.  And so it

9 couldn't have wholesale been adopting those battery

10 statutes as  as meaning use of physical force.

11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But Congress doesn't 

12 the  the statute doesn't talk  say  say the word

13 "battery."  It doesn't use it.

14             MS. VILLA:  Does not use the word "battery."

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It defines it in  in

16 this special way.

17             MS. VILLA:  It defines it in a very special

18 way.  And all of the parts, you have use of physical

19 force which this Court had defined as  as having been

20 made the user's instrument which is that intentionality

21 part prior to Congress adopting this.

22             It had consisted of use of physical force in

23 other statutes where recklessness was excluded, and

24 it's  it did not adopt  again, it doesn't say

25 battery anywhere in the statute.  And so saying that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 they adopted "battery" may be a way of trying to think 2 about it, but it's not what they wrote. 3             And they also narrowed the idea of what does 4 constitute a  an appropriate misdemeanor, because 5 again, as in Castleman, the court recognized that not 6 everything under the Tennessee statute would qualify 7 because there were threats but not threats of a deadly 8 weapon. 9             All of the  the use of physical force, the 10 attempt, attempts are specific intent crimes, and so 11 that's also an intentional crime.  And then threats are 12 usually very intentional.  And so  13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you please go back 14 to the question Justice Kagan asked you and not using 15 the shaking somebody, because I don't understand how 16 shaking someone doesn't constitute the use of physical 17 force.  It may not be great force, but it's  it's 18 touching. 19             What other example do you have of a reckless 20 act that wouldn't involve the use of physical force? 21 You're  you're sort of saying  22             MS. VILLA:  It's  23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   it has to be 24 intentionally offensive. 25             MS. VILLA:  Correct.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   as opposed to 

23

2             MS. VILLA:  And so if the government's

3 formulation were adopted, and I came up to somebody who

4 I thought was my husband and I patted him on the back

5 and say, hi, honey, and he turns around and it's like,

6 oh, my gosh, that isn't him.

7             I had  I touched him.  I intended to touch

8 him.  I was mistaken as to who it was.  And so that

9 person could take offense; that could be a reckless

10 touching that does not involve  it involves touching

11 minimally.  That could be an offense.

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It always involves,

13 however, the touching.

14             MS. VILLA:  It is 

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And the use of force to

16 constitute the touching.

17             MS. VILLA:  It could be by poisoning; it

18 could be by taking a pen out of somebody's hands.

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what difference does

20 it make whether it's intentional or reckless 

21             MS. VILLA:  It 

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   in terms of the

23 culpability involved?

24             MS. VILLA:  In terms of the culpability,

25 it's because it's not your intent to actually harm

24

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the 

3             MS. VILLA:  And so 

4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   use of force  and

5  and we're giving examples that are not domestic

6 violence examples, but that has caused a sufficiently

7 offensive touching to constitute a crime.  So that's

8 going to be prosecuted.

9             MS. VILLA:  And it could be prosecuted for

10 many reasons, including must arrest.  Some neighbor

11 hears a disturbance and so calls the police.  The police

12 comes and say, well, did he touch you?  She says, yeah,

13 he touched me, but it wasn't a big deal.  Okay.  You

14 have to be arrested.  You go in.  You go through the

15 process.  You plead guilty because you get out and you

16 need to go to work the next day.  Those are not the

17 types of scenarios that Congress had in mind 

18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The example that you

19 gave, though, would never come under this statute,

20 because there isn't a relationship.  You come up to a

21 stranger, walking behind the stranger, and you think the

22 stranger is your spouse.  Doesn't  that stranger is

23 not related to you in the way that the statute requires.

24             MS. VILLA:  That is true.  There are other

25 reasons, though, where interactions between people who

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
25 1 are related may not be  that the touching may occur, 2 but it may either not be wanting to be offensive such as 3 just wanting to touch somebody to wake them up instead 4 of wanting to offend them.  And so that's the 5 difference. 6             I would like to reserve the rest of my time 7 for rebuttal, please. 8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 9             Ms. Eisenstein. 10           ORAL ARGUMENT OF ILANA H. EISENSTEIN 11                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 12             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 13 it please the Court: 14             This Court has twice interpreted 15 Section 922(g)(9) in Hazen and Castleman, and each time 16 concluded that Congress intended to keep guns away from 17 those convicted of assault and battery under generally 18 applicable State and Federal and Tribal law. 19             Petitioner attempts to distinguish between 20 offenses that cause bodily injury and those that involve 21 offensive touching.  But as this Court already decided 22 in Castleman, that is a fallacy; that distinction is 23 elusive.  And that's because States, including those 24 that prohibit the causation of bodily injury, even those 25 offenses may include offenses that are similar in terms
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
26 1 of degree to offensive touching.  In fact, that was what 2 was at issue at Castleman itself.  It was the bodily 3 injury prong of the Tennessee statute, not the offensive 4 touching prong. 5             And  and in that case, the bodily injury 6 could be committed in a way that involved only slight 7 injury.  And yet, this Court refused to distinguish, by 8 degree of force, batteries that qualify Section 9 922(g)(9) predicates. 10             Keep in mind that States overwhelmingly 11 define battery as  only as to the resulting injury. 12 Petitioners' role, which would limit misdemeanor crimes 13 of domestic violence to intentional conduct, would 14 require a prosecutor in those jurisdictions to prove in 15 the underlying offense not only that the contact and the 16 push, the hit, the grab was intentional, but that 17 prosecutor would also have to show that the abuser 18 intended the resulting injury in order to prove the 19 battery offense under the vast majority of State and 20 under Federal law. 21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What's so bad about 22 that?  I mean, given her door example, for example, why 23 should the accidental or perhaps you would say she  24 you know, he or she knew that the person was close, why 25 should that constitute misdemeanor crime of domestic
Alderson Reporting Company

1 violence?

Official

27

2             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, in part because

3 Congress intended to cover batteries.  And the way 

4 not only at common law, but also in modern  under the

5 common and generic understanding of battery, define a

6 battery offense as  only as to the causation of the

7 resulting harm.

8             And keep in mind, reckless conduct  and

9 petitioner avoids the fact of what reckless conduct is.

10 A reckless conduct is not an involuntary or a negligent,

11 or even an accidental act.  Reckless conduct is

12 voluntary conduct.  It's conduct where an individual

13 chooses to act in conscious disregard of a substantial

14 and known risk of harm.

15             So if the  if the person in your example,

16 Mr. Chief Justice, slammed the door not realizing the

17 fingers were there, that's not going to be reckless

18 conduct at all.  That would be negligence at best.

19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I mean, you

20 don't know; you're running away.  What if it's a close

21 call?  You don't pause to think, well, gosh, maybe he's

22 close enough or she's close enough that this will, you

23 know, hurt his fingers or something.  I mean, is  is

24 that recklessness?

25             MS. EISENSTEIN:  I think to the degree to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
28 1 which the  the individual consciously disregards the 2 substantial  3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah.  You don't 4 want to turn around and see how close the person chasing 5 you is, if you slam the door, oh, gosh, that's going to 6 pinch the fingers or something. 7             MS. EISENSTEIN:  But  but I think that 8 the  what feels wrong about the hypothetical is not 9 the  the degree of intent of the act or  it's the 10 extent to which that person may be justified in the door 11 slamming, which was that this was an act, perhaps, of 12 selfdefense. 13             I think the more prototypical examples are 14 situations where  that this Court highlighted in 15 Castleman, where an individual takes intentional action 16 to make contact with their loved one and does so in a 17 way that is reckless as to whether, for example, if 18 there's a push, reckless as to whether his wife simply 19 stumbles backwards or falls down and injures herself. 20 And that's the way States overwhelmingly frame their 21 assault and battery statutes. 22             And that's what  23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Justice Ginsburg's example 24 of operating an automobile:  A husband is arguing with 25 his wife and speeds through a stop sign and the wife is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 injured.  What results under the statute?

29

2             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think

3 that under an assault, a general assault and battery

4 statute, it's theoretically possible that a person could

5 be convicted of battering his or her spouse under those

6 circumstances.  I don't think that's problematic for two

7 reasons.  One is I think it's an extremely narrow

8 category of offenses, and Petitioner has pointed to no

9 actual examples.

10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the  the main

11 statute says "recklessly causes bodily injury."

12             MS. EISENSTEIN:  So there  and I agree

13 with Your Honor that in theory, that type of offense

14 could constitute a battery.  But to the degree to which

15 that's prosecuted where  in the real world that's

16 prosecuted where the  a domestic family member is the

17 sole victim and that that is only a misdemeanor, that

18 there's not sufficiently severe injury or other factors

19 that rise to the level of a felony offense, which would

20 be disqualifying under its own right, I don't think that

21 that level of overbreadth is problematic under the

22 statute.

23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm not talking about

24 overbreadth.  I'm talking about interpretation of the

25 statute.  The statute includes a misdemeanor, so that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 disposes of that part of your answer.  The statute

30

2 covers a misdemeanor.

3             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Correct, Your Honor.  But

4 what I'm  but my point is that the type of scenario

5 that  that is posited where both there would be a

6 reckless, sort of a generally reckless conduct, that the

7 victim happens to be, by  by chance the family member,

8 as opposed to another member of the public, and thus

9 qualifying as a Section 922(g)(9) predicate is narrow

10 indeed.

11             And the converse of that is striking.  While

12 the  while the overbreadth of the hypothetical 

13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's narrow, but it seems

14 to qualify under the statute.  I don't quite understand

15 your answer.  You said, oh, well, it's narrow.  But it's

16 still a violation under the meaning of the statute.

17             MS. EISENSTEIN:  I think it's a violation

18 under the meaning of general assault and battery, but I

19 also think that there's nothing wrong with  as Justice

20 Kagan suggested, with treating that type of offense as

21 disqualifying.

22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you're saying that the

23 example is covered by the statute.

24             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Yes, Your Honor.

25             And I think, though, that to the extent to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
31 1 which that raises a concern in terms of overbreadth, I 2 don't think this Court should be concerned about that, 3 because what Congress was worried about wasn't an 4 overbreadth of these prosecutions against family 5 members.  Instead, they went to a real underreporting, 6 under prosecution and the low conviction rates of these 7 offenses.  This was the problem that Congress addressed. 8 And the whole reason why they extended the firearms ban 9 from felony offenses  10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Which of our  11 which of our cases say that you don't have to worry if 12 the categorical approach covers conduct of the sort 13 Justice Kennedy was talking about because Congress meant 14 to cover other things? 15             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think 16 that you're right that the categorical approach and its 17 strictures can cause real problems if there's any degree 18 of overbreadth in the statute.  But that's exactly why, 19 in interpreting Section 922(g)(9) and what Congress's 20 purpose was is extremely important here.  Because to the 21 extent to which Petitioner's view is adopted, which 22 would require only intentional conduct to qualify, any 23 degree of overbreadth such as Justice Kennedy's one 24 example in a State, of California of a driving offense 25 would exclude the entire statute, because 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not sure

32

2 "overbreadth"  I'm not sure overbreadth is the right

3 legal term.

4             So you think it's an appropriate defense

5 under a prosecution here that the type of conduct I was

6 charged with is really not what Congress had in mind?

7 Yes, it fits under the terms of the statute, but it's

8 not what Congress had in mind.  And there's going to be

9 argument about that.

10             MS. EISENSTEIN:  No, Your Honor.  The  my

11 argument is the opposite, which is that this Court

12 should effectuate Congress's purpose by giving

13 Section 922(g)(9) the meaning that Congress intended,

14 which is to cover generally applicable assault and

15 battery statutes regardless of whether, on a rare

16 instance, they may end up covering an individual who was

17 recklessly driving and injured a family member.

18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I feel like your answer

19 was that the statute does cover it, but it's most

20 unlikely that a prosecutor would bring such a case.  I

21 think that's what you started to say about it.

22             MS. EISENSTEIN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

23 I think it's unlikely that those prosecutions would be

24 brought in the State offense on those  under those

25 circumstances and that there's no reason to drastically

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 constrain the interpretation of Section 922(g)(9).

33

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do we have precedent from

3 this Court saying it's okay, we can trust the

4 prosecutors to do the right thing?  Can you cite me a

5 case that says that?

6             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Your Honor, I  I  I do

7 not  I do not represent that.  But what I do suggest

8 is what we're looking at here is not what prosecutors

9 might do under the  in the State  the underlying

10 State prosecution, but what Congress intended to cover

11 under Section 922(g)(9).  So in order to avoid a

12 hypothetical scenario where a family member may be

13 injured in a nondomestic context, the result of

14 requiring intentionality as to both the harm and the 

15 the touching would be to eliminate all of the statutes

16 that Congress, in fact, intended to cover.

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't know how 

18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the  what

19 about the  the rule of lenity?  We are reviewing a

20 decision of a court that divided, and both judges wrote

21 very strong opinions.  And we also have 18 U.S.C.

22 Section 16, where a crime of violence doesn't include

23 reckless  a reckless state of mind.  So putting those

24 together, the other statute, plus that this was a split

25 decision, why doesn't the rule of lenity apply?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Your Honor, the rule of

34

2 lenity only applies where there is grievous ambiguity in

3 the statute.  And I respectfully submit that there is no

4 such grievous ambiguity.  Congress's intent was clear,

5 and this Court already found as much, in Castleman and

6 in Hayes, which is that there was a class of offenses

7 that Congress intended to cover by the statute which

8 were generally applicable assault and battery statutes.

9             And the rule that Petitioner suggests would

10 exclude all of those offenses and would frustrate that

11 clear purpose of Congress, so lenity doesn't apply for

12 that reason.  And there's no ambiguity, not only as to

13 the purpose, but as to  as to what battery itself

14 encompasses.  Petitioners have tried to argue that

15 battery, either at common law or in contemporary

16 practice, that there was some requirement of an intent

17 to do harm.  And the overwhelming weight and universal

18 weight of authority points the opposite direction.  Even

19 the sources cited by Petitioner establish that at common

20 law, there was no requirement for the intent to do harm.

21 And certainly States, in adopting their assault and

22 battery provisions, have modeled that  that

23 formulation.

24             Another way to look at this is  outside of

25 the common law, is the way that Taylor examined the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 statute of burglary under the ACCA offense, which is

35

2 to  rather than turning just to the common law, as to

3 view this as covering generic battery.  And  and when

4 looked at that way under the contemporary practice, the

5 Model Penal Code and the uniform opinion of the courts

6 of appeals and commentators all have concluded that

7 battery was not limited to a purpose to cause a

8 resulting harm, but included contact that could be

9 reckless.

10             In the face of Petitioner's hypotheticals,

11 Petitioner struggles to even conceive of a hypothetical

12 example of where there is a reckless battery that

13 would  against a family member that would not

14 constitute a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.

15             The converse is that Congress enacted

16 Section 19  922(g)(9) to address a vital  vital

17 public safety problem.  It identified those who had been

18 convicted of battering their family members as posing a

19 dramatically increased risk of perpetrating future gun

20 violence against their family.

21             This Court should continue to interpret

22 Section 922(g)(9) in light of that compelling purpose.

23             If there are no further questions.

24             JUSTICE THOMAS:  Ms. Eisenstein, one

25 question.

Alderson Reporting Company

36

2 violation.  It suspends a constitutional right.  Can you

3 give me another area where a misdemeanor violation

4 suspends a constitutional right?

5             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Your Honor, I  I'm

6 thinking about that, but I think that the  the

7 question is not  as I understand Your Honor's

8 question, the culpability necessarily of the act or in

9 terms of the offense 

10             JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, I'm  I'm looking at

11 the  you're saying that recklessness is sufficient to

12 trigger a violation  misdemeanor violation of domestic

13 conduct that results in a lifetime ban on possession of

14 a gun, which, at least as of now, is still a

21 think of specifically triggered by a misdemeanor

EISENSTEIN:  Your Honor, the right is 6 suspended indefinitely. 7             JUSTICE THOMAS:  Okay.  So can you think of 8 a First Amendment suspension or a suspension of a First 9 Amendment right that is permanent? 10             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Your Honor, it's not 11 necessarily permanent as to the individual, but it may 12 be permanent as to a particular harm.

2 member's involved in a misdemeanor violation; therefore,

3 a constitutional right is suspended.

4             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Yes, Your Honor, but I

5 believe that in terms of the  the relationship between

6 Congress's decision to try to prevent domestic gun

7 violence and its means of doing so 

8             JUSTICE THOMAS:  Even if that  if even if

9 that violence is unrelated to the use  the possession

10 of a gun?

11             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think

12 the studies that Congress relied upon in formulating

13 the  the misdemeanor crime of domestic violence ban

14 didn't  were directly about the use of a gun because

15 what they showed is that individuals who have previously

16 been  battered their spouses, pose up to a sixfold

17 greater risk of killing, by a gun, their family member.

18             JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, let's  let's say

19 that a publisher is reckless about the use of children,

20 and what could be considered indecent displays and that

21 that triggers a violation of, say, a hypothetical law

22 against the use of children in these ads, and let's say

23 it's a misdemeanor violation.  Could you suspend that

24 publisher's right to ever publish again?

25             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Your Honor, I don't think

39 1 you could suspend the right to ever publish again, but I 2 think that you could limit, for example, the manner and 3 means by which publisher  4             JUSTICE THOMAS:  So how is that different 5 from suspending your Second Amendment right? 6             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Your Honor, I think that in 7 terms of a  the compelling purpose that was identified 8 here, which was the prevention of gun violence and the 9 individual nature of the  of the underlying offense, 10 so here this isn't a misdemeanor crime directed at any 11 person at large.  These are misdemeanor batteries 12 directed at members  specified members of the  of 13 that individual's family.  Congress  14             JUSTICE THOMAS:  Would you have a better 15 case if this were a gun crime? 16             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Your Honor, I think it 17 would be perhaps a better case, except that the evidence 18 that Congress relied on and  and that the courts below 19 that have addressed the Second Amendment concerns that 20 Your Honor is highlighting have even gone into a more 21 robust analysis of the  the evidence that ties initial 22 crimes of battery to future gun violence.  That evidence 23 is extremely strong.  And Congress recognized that this 24 was a recurring escalating offense. 25             Petitioners are good examples of this.

1 While they didn't reach, thankfully, the point where

40

2 they were able to reach for a firearm and were

3 prohibited from having a firearm under Federal law, they

4 have each been convicted multiple times of domestic

5 violence offenses and possess the firearms in close

6 proximity.  So these aren't individuals who had longago

7 convictions and are suffering from that ban.

8             Congress also contemplated exactly the

9 lifetime nature of the ban that Your Honor suggested and

10 left it in States' hands to resolve that by allowing

11 States to expunge or pardon convictions in cases where

12 an individual either petitions to do so or in some

13 States as a matter of course.

14             So  so I understand Your Honor's concern

15 that  that this is a potential infringement of

16 individual's Second Amendment rights, but I believe that

17 Congress has identified a compelling purpose and has

18 found a reasonable means of achieving that purpose.

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I  I suppose one answer

20 is  just a partial answer to Justice Thomas's question

21 is SORNA, a violation of sexual offenders have to

22 register before they can travel in interstate commerce.

23 But that's not a prevention from traveling at all.  It's

24 just a  it's a restriction.

They say, 7 let's focus on the cases in which there is a misdemeanor 8 battery conducted without an intentional or knowing 9 state of mind. 10             Now, they say if this, in fact, triggers  11 this is the question Justice Thomas asked  if this, in 12 fact, triggers a lifetime ban on the use of a gun, then 13 do we not have to decide something we haven't decided? 14 And I think it would be a major question. 15             What constitutes a reasonable regulation of 16 guns under the Second Amendment given Heller and the 17 other cases with which I disagreed?  But  18             (Laughter.) 19             JUSTICE BREYER:   the point is, she's 20 raised a question, and she wants us to answer that 21 question.  Is this a reasonable regulation given  you 22 just heard the argument, in part  given the distance 23 and so forth?  So what am I supposed to say, in your 24 opinion, in respect to that rather important question? 25             MS. EISENSTEIN:  Your Honor, two answers to
Alderson Reporting Company

1 that.  First is this comes up only in the nature of

42

2 constitutional avoidance, not as a direct Second

3 Amendment challenge.

4             As we've already argued, this statute, in

5 the government's view, is clear that misdemeanor crimes

6 of domestic violence include batteries, whether they be

7 committed 

8             JUSTICE BREYER:  Stop you at the first

9 point.  Your argument on the first point is that she did

10 not raise the constitutional question.  She said in

11 order to avoid a constitutional question, we should

12 decide it in thus such and such a way.

13             So one answer would be, well, maybe so.  We

14 aren't facing the constitutional question.  We are

15 simply facing the question of what Congress intended.

16 And if this does raise a constitutional question, so be

17 it.  And then there will, in a future case, come up with

18 that question.  So we  or our point is, we don't have

19 to decide that here.

20             MS. EISENSTEIN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

43

2               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS,

3                 APPOINTED BY THIS COURT

4             MS. VILLA:  Your Honor, Congress did not use

5 the word "battery" in 921(a)(33).  And so the question

6 is, is whether, under the rule of lenity, the Court can

7 then say battery is the standard that we are going to

8 use in order to construe this.  And it's a push me, pull

9 you because it is the use of force, but that doesn't

10 have to be a prior battery conviction.  It could be any

11 misdemeanor conviction that has a state of recklessness

12 for the state of mind and results in any  any

13 involvement of a domestic partner.

14             And I think that there is enough play within

15 the statute  statute itself, as well as the extent of

16 the common law, so  to say that that is a reason for

17 applying the rule of lenity.

18             There is also the underlying constitutional

19 questions.  And this Court, as in being able to abrogate

20 a constitutional right indefinitely based on reckless

21 conduct, I believe also presents extreme due process

22 concerns.  And for those reasons, I believe that the

23 Court should conclude that under these circumstances, it

24 is best to avoid that question and to construe the

25 statute the way that is consistent with the words.
