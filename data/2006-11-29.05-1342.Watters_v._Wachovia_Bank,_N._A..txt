1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in 05-1342, Watters v. Wachovia Bank. 5 Mr. Blanchard. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOHN BLANCHARD 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. BLANCHARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 9 it please the Court: 10 The dual banking system of State and Federal 11 regulation in our nation which we've enjoyed for over 12 140 years is one of the finest examples of cooperative 13 federalism in our history. For 35 years, the States, 14 not the OCC, have prudently exercised their authority 15 over non-bank State-chartered operating local 16 subsidiaries of national banks. Indeed, respondent 17 Wachovia Mortgage complied with Michigan law for 6 years 18 until in 2003 there was a corporate reshuffling and now 19 it claims it's exempt from the same Michigan laws it 20 complied with. 21 The OCC through its Regulation 7.40006 has 22 disrupted the careful balance and seeks to deprive the 23 States of the regulatory authority that they have 24 historically exercised. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the national bank set

1 up its mortgage operations as a division or as a 2 department, then the sole regulator would be OCC, right? 3 MR. BLANCHARD: That's correct, Your Honor. 4 But Wachovia Bank and Wachovia Mortgage made a choice. 5 They made a business judgment to create a 6 State-chartered operating subsidiary. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did they do 8 that? What's the advantage to them having that 9 subsidiary rather than doing this directly? 10 MR. BLANCHARD: Your Honor, the advantage is 11 that Wachovia Bank insulates itself from liability, 12 because it's a bedrock principle of state corporate law 13 that the parent corporation is not liable for the acts 14 of the subsidiary corporation. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So mortgage 16 subsidiary could possibly get into some trouble that the 17 bank wants to protect itself from and not have -- they 18 have a certain number of assets that are subject to 19 liability in the subsidiary, but they would -- otherwise 20 they'd expose the whole bank to those liabilities? 21 MR. BLANCHARD: Absolutely, Your Honor. 22 From -- the conception behind operating subsidiaries was 23 to separate a certain part of the business and the 24 attendant risks of that business also to separate. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume that the
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Federal regulating authorities require a certain ratio 2 of loans to real estate value, things of that sort. And 3 I assume that the States may have different rules with 4 regard to that; right? In other words, the oversight 5 might be different. The States may be more permissive 6 as to certain loans or as to, you know, what the balance 7 sheet of the bank has to look like than the Federal 8 Government is. And if you have a State subsidiary that 9 is overseen by state authorities, you might have a 10 different result. 11 MR. BLANCHARD: Possibly, but -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if not I don't see 13 any advantage in this great Federal banking system 14 you're talking about, if it's Tweedledum and Tweedledee. 15 MR. BLANCHARD: Well, the States do not -16 exclusive visitorial powers over national banks rest 17 with the OCC. But Wachovia Bank and Wachovia Mortgage 18 are separate and distinct. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not seeking 20 visit -- "visitorial," is that the word? 21 MR. BLANCHARD: Correct. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not seeking 23 visitorial rights with respect to the parent bank. 24 MR. BLANCHARD: Absolutely not. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not arguing
5

1 that because you need to see more about the mortgage 2 subsidiary you need to see what the parent is up to? 3 MR. BLANCHARD: No. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 5 MR. BLANCHARD: No, we're not. Michigan and 6 the States want to be able to help their citizens with 7 abusive and predatory lending complaints. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that it was a 9 national bank. Forget the subsidiary. And your State 10 says: Well, we want to have a law here that says we 11 want to send our own bank examiners in. And moreover, 12 we don't want them to make any loans in excess of 12 13 percent interest. Fine. Would that be constitutional? 14 I mean, wouldn't be preempted? 15 MR. BLANCHARD: As to the national bank? 16 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 17 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, of course, because it 19 conflicts and they don't want it. 20 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Do they have 22 the authority to say a subsidiary is a national bank? 23 MR. BLANCHARD: No. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: No, they can't? Where is 25 it in the law that says they don't have the authority to

1 say that a subsidiary of a national bank owned by a 2 national bank is a national bank? Is there something 3 specifically that stops them from saying that? 4 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: What? 6 MR. BLANCHARD: The Gold Foods case, the -7 JUSTICE BREYER: What is it? What is it -8 I mean, what statute or what is it that prevents them 9 from saying it? I don't know the Gold Foods case. 10 MR. BLANCHARD: Well, the point is that the 11 corporate law recognizes the two as separate and 12 distinct corporate entities. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought your point was 14 that the statute defines national bank, but also defines 15 affiliates, and refers to them as two separate entities. 16 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes, Your Honor. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I thought your point 18 was that the effect of this regulation is to simply 19 eliminate that distinction? 20 MR. BLANCHARD: You're right. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Their argument, they 22 haven't argued -- I realize this was a hypothetical, but 23 they haven't argued that the subsidiary should be 24 treated as a national bank. They're arguing that 25 they're entitled to say that the same preemption that
7

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 applies to the national bank applies to the 2 subsidiaries. 3 MR. BLANCHARD: Exactly. That's what they 4 -5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Presumably, if they 6 said it's treated as a national bank they would lose the 7 benefit of the separate corporate existence when it came 8 to issues of liability. If they said this subsidiary is 9 a national bank, then presumably the separate corporate 10 existence they're seeking to take advantage of would be 11 obliterated. 12 MR. BLANCHARD: Well, but that's the -- they 13 are trying to contend that they are one and the same. 14 But they can't have their cake and eat it, too. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess we can ask 16 the respondents. But is it your understanding that 17 respondents take the position that the State has no 18 control at all over whether or not the shares have been 19 properly issued, whether or not certain accounting 20 requirements applicable to all corporations have been 21 complied with? 22 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes, that is my 23 understanding of their position. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They say that there's no 25 area of State law that is applicable to the subsidiary

1 corporation? 2 MR. BLANCHARD: They are saying that 3 visitorial powers over the State-chartered operating 4 subs is exclusively -5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I could understand that 6 with reference to just the amount of consumer loans, as 7 Justice Scalia was talking about. But just to see if 8 the corporation has a -- had -- had a meeting that year, 9 has duly elected its officers under State law, do the 10 respondents take the position you have no authority to 11 visit the corporation to determine that? 12 MR. BLANCHARD: They take the authority -13 the position that Michigan has no authority to impose on 14 the State-chartered operating sub the two Michigan 15 laws -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But let's -- there are 17 two different kinds of regulations. I think 18 Justice Kennedy was talking about regulations of a 19 chartering State. This subsidiary was set up under the 20 law of a State. It wasn't Michigan. Is there -- is 21 anyone contesting that --was it North Carolina? 22 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes, you're correct. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that they have to meet 24 all the requirements for setting up a corporation and 25 having meetings and all that that North Carolina
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 requires of corporations that are incorporated in that 2 State? 3 MR. BLANCHARD: No, I've not heard them say 4 that as to North Carolina law. But what they're saying 5 is that the Michigan Mortgage Broker, Lenders and 6 Servicers Licensing Act and the Michigan Secondary 7 Mortgage Act do not apply to them. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that seems to be a 9 standard preemption case. It's not as broad as just 10 visitorial powers generally. Maybe I'm wrong. Do some 11 subsidiaries of the -- of a national bank do things 12 other than banking, say title insurance or something 13 like that? I don't see anything in the record where the 14 OCC wants to displace the State as to that. This is 15 just a standard preemption case. When the OCC has 16 regulations that control, then the State has no 17 authority to add to those regulations or to have, or to 18 have contrary regulations. But if it's something that 19 doesn't have to do with banking at all, then I suppose 20 they would say -- I can ask them -- I suppose they say 21 the State has authority to regulate. 22 MR. BLANCHARD: The important point, though, 23 Your Honor, is that the OCC has no independent power to 24 preempt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign 25 State.
10

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't it have exactly the 2 same power that any other agency or Congress has? That 3 it has the power, if its regulation is authorized, it 4 has the power to what they say, preempt a state law that 5 obstructs, impairs, or conditions a bank's ability fully 6 to exercise its federally authorized real estate lending 7 powers? That's what they say, and then they list some 8 examples. 9 Suppose they said nothing. Wouldn't we be 10 in the same boat? After all, a state cannot under the 11 Federal Constitution normally enact a law that 12 interferes or stands as an obstacle to the achievement 13 of the objective of the Federal law. 14 So if that's right, or if it's wrong, 15 explain why it's wrong, but if it's right, why don't you 16 tell me whether the two laws that you are worried about 17 do or do not stand as an obstacle to the full 18 achievement of the purposes of the statute as 19 implemented by their regulation? 20 MR. BLANCHARD: They do not. 21 First of all, if the OCC -- if Congress 22 intends to alter the balance that I spoke of earlier, it 23 must do so with clear and manifest language. There must 24 be unmistakably clear language that Congress intended to 25 authorize the OCC to preempt the state law.

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Let's assume I don't agree 2 with you about that, that I think conflict preemption 3 does not require clear language. Assume that, even 4 though you disagree with it. Now on my assumption that 5 you can have the law if it doesn't conflict, but you 6 can't have the law if it does conflict, so now you 7 explain to me why the two laws at issue here don't 8 conflict. 9 MR. BLANCHARD: Your Honor, in the Barnett 10 case and in the Atherton case, in order to have the kind 11 of problem you're talking about, there must be a 12 significant interference with the business of banking or 13 an incapacitation of the business of banking. Our 14 Michigan law doesn't incapacitate what -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Blanchard, may I ask 16 you a question, perhaps preliminary to what you are 17 launching into? My understanding was that you did not 18 question the OCC's regulatory authority over a unit that 19 it says can do what the national bank itself could do in 20 the real estate business, no more, no less. OCC 21 regulation, visitation, all the rest, OCC's regulations 22 validly applied to this subsidiary that has been set up 23 in North Carolina and is operating in Michigan; is that 24 right? It is one thing for you to say we have the 25 authority to regulate. Are you saying at the same time
12

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that OCC is out of the picture because its dual 2 regulation conflicts with the inevitable? 3 MR. BLANCHARD: I am not saying that. What 4 I am saying is the OCC does not have the exclusive 5 right. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ah, you're saying, you 7 started to say they can't have their cake and eat it 8 too, but you're saying they can have the worst of all 9 possible regulatory worlds, so that they've got two 10 equally competent regulators, and they have to meet the 11 requirements of both? 12 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes. I am saying that -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if they don't 14 want to, they don't have to set up a separate 15 subsidiary, right? They can do this business directly 16 as a national bank and they're not going to be subject 17 to any visitation? 18 MR. BLANCHARD: You are absolutely correct. 19 As I started to say earlier, they made that choice and 20 they came to Michigan, and they obtained a certificate 21 of authority from the Michigan Corporations Division as 22 a foreign for-profit corporation doing business in the 23 state. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And I would 25 have thought your answer to Justice Breyer was yes, that
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 they get to regulate to the extent they want to, and the 2 state does, and if there's a conflict, the federal 3 regulation will prevail, but what's the problem here is 4 that they're issuing a categorical regulation saying the 5 state can't regulate at all. 6 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes. They are claiming 7 exclusive preemptive authority. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand that 9 you made this -10 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just finish, please? 11 You argued, as I understand it, correctly, that the 12 state does, exercises certain regulatory controls that 13 will not be exercised -- will not be replaced by federal 14 controls; is that right? In other words, you -- that 15 they will be unregulated to a certain extent? There 16 will be less regulation under the federal sovereign than 17 there is under the state; is that correct? 18 MR. BLANCHARD: You are correct, Your Honor, 19 in that Wachovia Mortgage as a subsidiary of a national 20 bank is a registrant under Michigan law. And as a 21 registrant, it is not subject to an annual -22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can you give me some 23 specific examples of what Michigan would require that 24 the OCC does not require? You mentioned licensing, for 25 example.

1 MR. BLANCHARD: Michigan would require 2 Wachovia Mortgage to register. There's a difference 3 between registration and licensure. As a subsidiary of 4 Wachovia Bank, they are a registrant like they've been 5 for the last -6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that have any impact 7 on the way they run their business? 8 MR. BLANCHARD: No. 9 JUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, does it make any 10 difference as a matter of what they have to do in order 11 to comply with the law that they are now exempt from 12 Michigan rules and subject to Federal rules instead? 13 MR. BLANCHARD: No. Michigan just wants to 14 be able to -- and the other states -- to deal with fraud 15 and deceit and material misrepresentation in mortgage 16 transactions, and to have a say over the corporations 17 that come to their state and do business. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Blanchard, if I could 19 go back to what you were saying before this last line of 20 questioning, I didn't understand your position to be 21 that the OCC can come in and regulate this non-Federal 22 bank up to the point where its -- well, can do it 23 apparently without limitation. And where its regulation 24 conflicts with the state regulation, the Federal 25 prevails.

BLANCHARD: That's the difference. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Federal Government says 6 you can have outstanding loans of $10 billion and the 7 state says no, you can have outstanding loans of 8 8 billion. 9 MR. BLANCHARD: No, Your Honor, the -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. What happens in that 11 situation? 12 MR. BLANCHARD: Well, it doesn't happen in 13 Michigan because -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, invent some other 15 hypothetical then. I'm talking about a situation in 16 which the Federal law is more permissive than the state 17 law. Which law prevails? The Federal law allows this 18 bank to do things which the state law would not allow it 19 to do. As I understood your prior answer, you say oh, 20 of course, if the Federal law allows to it do things the 21 state law doesn't allow to it do, the Federal law 22 prevails. I didn't understand that to be your position. 23 And if it is your position, I don't know what all this 24 fuss is about. That's the end of the game, isn't it? 25 MR. BLANCHARD: No, Your Honor. You see,

1 in -- we do not conduct -- they are exempt from an 2 examination where we go in and look yearly at such 3 things as capital assets management, earnings, 4 liquidity. Those aren't the kinds of things that we're 5 talking about. They, as a registrant, they are exempt 6 from that, from an annual examination. They're not 7 incapacitated, nor are -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exempt from state 9 examination? 10 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes. The state chartered 11 corporation, Wachovia Mortgage, is exempt under Michigan 12 law from an annual examination. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: We're not looking for that. 14 We're looking for the opposite. As I read this, the 15 banking agency has not said, we wipe out all of your 16 laws. They've said, we wipe out a subset of laws, which 17 are defined as those laws that obstruct, impair, or 18 limit the ability of this bank to fulfill its federally 19 mandated powers. Okay? So they're just saying, we only 20 get the ones that are in conflict. Now, they then have 21 a list of which ones they preempt and which ones they 22 don't. So my question to you is, give me a list here of 23 which ones they think conflict that you think don't. 24 MR. BLANCHARD: They -- their position is 25 that both laws that we append to our brief, both laws in
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 their entirety, are preempted. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Their position is 3 not that it only preempts in cases of conflict. Under 4 12c apart, 7.4006, it says, state laws apply to national 5 bank operated subsidiaries, which is what we're dealing 6 with here, to the same extent that those laws apply to 7 the parent national bank, which is to say not at all. 8 MR. BLANCHARD: Correct. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's not a case 10 of conflict preemption. They're trying to preempt state 11 law whether it conflicts or not, right? 12 MR. BLANCHARD: That's correct, Your Honor. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You do have -- one thing 14 that seems concrete and clear to me -- correct me if I 15 get this wrong -- Michigan is kind of deferring to OCC 16 in its primary jurisdiction sense. It says customers, 17 if you've got complaints about what this operating 18 subsidiary is doing, you go first to the OCC; and then 19 if we think -- we, Michigan -- thinks OCC has not given 20 you an adequate response to your complaint, we take 21 over. 22 MR. BLANCHARD: You are exactly correct. 23 That's the Michigan regulatory -24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's kind of a reverse 25 supremacy. Where it's usually the feds that have the
18

1 last word, but here you're saying Michigan has decided 2 that it will let OCC go first and Michigan will be kind 3 of a supervisor for the adequacy of the OCC's handling 4 of the consumer's complaint? 5 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes, you are exactly 6 correct. Our regulatory framework in Michigan says that 7 the complaint is referred to the appropriate Federal 8 agency, and only if that complaint is not being 9 adequately pursued does the commissioner have that 10 window of investigative authority for her to pursue it. 11 It is a cooperative type of statute. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know another 13 arrangement where the Federal agency goes first but then 14 the state agency has authority to say Federal agency, 15 you didn't deal with this consumer adequately, so we 16 will take over? I know schemes that work the other way 17 where the state goes first, and then the Federal 18 authority, but do you know another one? 19 MR. BLANCHARD: Another one that -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where the primary 21 adjudicator, decision-maker would be the Federal 22 authority, but then the state can override that if it 23 thinks the Federal authority hasn't done an adequate 24 job? 25 MR.

BLANCHARD: No situations come directly 9 to mind. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe civil rights actions 11 where there's a Federal agency that has some remedial 12 powers and if the Federal agency doesn't act, the 13 citizen is free to bring litigation in state court? I 14 guess that would be -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or environmental 16 regulation where just because the Federal EPA doesn't 17 take a particular action against a polluter, doesn't 18 mean that the state can't take action against the 19 polluter. 20 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes, Your Honor. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't the action an 22 inadequate action? Michigan is saying yeah, the Federal 23 authority can do with respect to this unit just what it 24 would do to a national bank itself, but if we think that 25 is inadequate, that is a question of just one act or the

BLANCHARD: Yes. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the Federal 5 U.S. Attorney prosecutes, decides to prosecute someone 6 for manslaughter, the state can decide that's not an 7 adequate enough response and prosecute them for murder, 8 right? 9 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes, Your Honor. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: Could the OCC -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did this go through your -12 can I just ask -13 JUSTICE ALITO: Sure. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: This still goes to the same 15 thing. Does Michigan do this by grace?

BLANCHARD: The Federal rule provides 8 that the operating -- the State chartered operating subs 9 are to be treated just like the law pertaining to the 10 parent national bank. And there is no authority from 11 Congress given to the OCC that kind of rule. The OCC 12 only has the authority that Congress gives it, either 13 through a preemptive statute or through the dell 14 designation of preemptive authority; and Congress has 15 not given them that kind of power. 16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask the question -17 the regulatory question. You do not dispute Michigan 18 does not dispute that the operating -- well, strike 19 that. 20 Michigan does not dispute that national 21 banks can go into business of real estate loans? 22 And Michigan does not dispute that Congress 23 has authorized national banks to operate through 24 subsidiaries for specific purposes like this. 25 My question is can you give me any plausible
22

1 reason to think that Congress would have contemplated 2 this system of potentially more restrictive State 3 legislation when its national bank in a given instance 4 decides to do -- to exercise its Federal banking power 5 through a subsidiary rather than directly? 6 Can you think of any reason that Congress 7 would have contemplated the scheme that you're, that 8 you're defending? 9 MR. BLANCHARD: Well, first of all, Your 10 Honor, I'm not defending that Michigan has a more 11 restrictive scheme or that Michigan law in any way 12 incapacitates or significantly interferes with the 13 business of banking. 14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if, if -- if the 15 banks have got, let's say, a subsidiary has to go 16 through two rounds of bank inspection every year instead 17 of one round, it is going to cost them something. 18 Regulation costs the regulated entity something. It is 19 a burden on them. 20 And we also have to assume that there may be 21 instances -- you brought it up -- in, in which the, the 22 -- the State burden is heavier. So with those 23 possibilities in mind, can you think of any reason why 24 Congress in authorizing the exercise of the Federal 25 banking power through a subsidiary would have
23

1 contemplated Michigan or any State would have this 2 authority? 3 It seems counterintuitive to me. They're 4 saying you can -- - you can -- you banks can exercise 5 the Federal banking power through a subsidiary. It 6 would seem strange to me that Congress would silently 7 say, "and, of course, we acquiesce to a -- a dual system 8 of regulation that would not apply to the bank itself." 9 What reason would Congress have had for 10 assuming that might be the result? 11 MR. BLANCHARD: A recognition that the 12 States have a sovereign, compelling and legitimate 13 interest in regulating those corporations that it 14 charters and that do business within its borders. And 15 -- and that that balance should be respected. 16 JUSTICE SOUTER: So it is state sovereign 17 immunity in effect, is the answer -- State sovereignty 18 is rather the answer? 19 MR. BLANCHARD: But the - but the key point, 20 and I would like to reserve whatever time I may have. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You better hurry 22 then. 23 MR. BLANCHARD: The key, the key point is 24 that Congress has distinguished clearly and 25 unequivocally between affiliates and national banks; but

LONG 9 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 10 MR. LONG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 11 please the Court. 12 I would like to start with the question that 13 Justice Souter asked because there are some important 14 principles that are really not disputed in this case, 15 and I think they help to focus the issue that is before 16 the Court. 17 There is no dispute, as we understand it, 18 that mortgage lending by national banks is supervised 19 exclusively by the Comptroller of the Currency. And 20 there is also no dispute that national banks' incidental 21 powers under Section 247 include the power to make 22 mortgage loans through a operating subsidiary. And an 23 additional point is that both Federal statutes and 24 Federal regulations state that when national banks make 25 mortgage loans or exercise their banking powers through

1 subsidiaries they do so subject to the same terms and 2 conditions that apply to the exercise of the power by 3 the national -4 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Blanchard, may I ask 5 you a question. I just want to understand. Wachovia 6 has branch banks all over the country. Are they 7 generally subsidiaries or are they divisions of the 8 bank? 9 MR. LONG: Well, a branch of a national bank 10 has a particular status under Section 36 of the National 11 Bank Act. 12 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that. I'm 13 asking a factual question. 14 MR. LONG: It would not be separately 15 incorporated. So -16 JUSTICE STEVENS: They are actually 17 divisions, in effect, of the national bank itself? 18 MR. LONG: Well, I think they are generally 19 referred to as branches but I think its would be more a 20 division. That would be -21 JUSTICE STEVENS: At least they are not 22 separate corporate subsidiaries. 23 MR. LONG: That -- that -24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why is that, that the Best 25 bank decided to use the subsidiary approach for this
26

1 business, rather than the more traditional banking 2 approach. 3 MR. LONG: Well, of course, anything that a 4 bank does through an operating subsidiary it could do 5 through the bank. It can always do it through the bank. 6 But there are many reasons why a bank may choose an 7 operating subsidiary. They can be managerial reasons; 8 it's -- just sometimes works better as matter of 9 business management. 10 JUSTICE STEVENS: It protects from 11 liability, too. 12 MR. LONG: Well, that is one of the reasons. 13 Although -14 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- in the district. 15 MR. LONG: I will say, Justice Stevens, I 16 have not been able to find examples of national bank 17 operating subsidiaries that have become insolvent. They 18 are regulated very heavily by the Comptroller and so 19 they don't. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you have a 21 subsidiary that's in the mortgage lending business that 22 presumably competes with other companies in the mortgage 23 lending business that are not associated with national 24 banks, and you're claiming an immunity from the 25 regulation that their competitors are subject to. Is

And its undisputed 4 -5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's fine, and 6 they have an express provision in 48 -- 484(a) that says 7 they're, they're exempt from regulation. The question 8 is whether a separate subsidiary that is not a national 9 bank that competes with other mortgage lending companies 10 is immune from the regulation that those other 11 companies -12 MR. LONG: But again, Mr. Chief Justice, 13 thrifts, S&Ls, State-Chartered banks in all 50 States 14 are permitted to have operating subsidiaries. It's 15 recognized not just for national banks, but really for 16 all types of banking institutions, that are operating 17 subsidiaries are a useful tool of banking. This is not 18 a sort of special privilege that's given -19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Breyer's 20 questions were pointing out, to the extent your 21 regulation -- the Federal regulation of your subsidiary 22 conflicts with the State law, that regulation is going 23 to prevail. The question is whether or not you are 24 immune from State regulation across the board -25 MR. LONG: Well, and you asked that
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 question. I mean, I think it might be useful to think 2 first about national banks and then about the operating 3 subsidiaries. It is not true that there are no State 4 laws that apply to national banks. 5 This Court's unanimous Barnett Bank decision 6 is the clearest statement of the principle. Any State 7 laws that prevent or significantly impair or impede the 8 exercise of national banking powers are preempted. But 9 many State laws having to do with contracts -10 JUSTICE ALITO: In real world terms, what's 11 involved here? What are examples of some of the things 12 that Michigan does or some other State does that impair 13 or impede the operations to the -14 MR. LONG: The beginning is, it is a 15 complete separate set of regulation. You have to 16 register or obtain a license. You have to submit to 17 examination by the regulator. Investigation. 18 Enforcement. There are substantive laws; Michigan has 19 some that are not directly at issue in this case -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of those laws 21 might be, I mean, let's say they have a law, when you're 22 issuing a mortgage to a consumer, you have to give them 23 a disclosure about how much they're going to end up 24 paying over the life of the loan and all that. And they 25 require that of anybody who issues a mortgage in

1 Michigan. Could that law be applied to your subsidiary? 2 MR. LONG: Well, the question, Mr. Chief 3 Justice, would be is it preempted as to the national 4 bank? The Comptroller of the Currency would say yes. 5 But the issue in this case is if it is preempted as to 6 the national bank, then it is also preempted when the 7 national bank chooses to exercise this power that it has 8 under Section 24 -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't -- isn't your 10 friend correct then? You are really trying to have your 11 cake and eat it, too. You're saying if we did this 12 without a subsidiary, we wouldn't be subject to that. 13 But you want to be able to operate through a subsidiary 14 and yet not be subject to the same rules that apply to 15 other people. 16 MR. LONG: Well, but it, it with respect, it 17 is not really a case of having our cake and eating it, 18 too. We are in the area of powers of national banks. 19 And the Court has recognized for a century that in that 20 area, when national banks have powers, including 21 incidental powers recognized by the Comptroller, they 22 generally preempt any State law that prevents or 23 significantly interferes -24 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the question I had. 25 I got somewhat thrown by the Chief Justice's question,
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 because I thought first, when I read the reg, 34.4.ab, 2 that those things that are preempted are those things 3 that obstruct, impair or condition, or in other words 4 limit, the Federal powers of a national bank. 5 MR. LONG: That, that is correct. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: But I thought we were 7 basically dealing with conflict -8 MR. LONG: Yes. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- not fielding. 10 MR. LONG: It's -- that's one level -11 JUSTICE BREYER: But -- but the last part of 12 the reg says that what applies, no State law applies to 13 a national bank operating subsidiary if it doesn't apply 14 to the parent bank. And I began to think it fields 15 preemption. Am I right in thinking that it is conflict 16 preemption, not field, because it is conflict in the 17 case of a national bank? 18 MR. LONG: Well -- it's, it's a very 19 important point. And our position is there are actually 20 several ways in which you could analyze this case and 21 arrive at the conclusion that the Comptroller's 22 regulations are valid. One is looking simply at 23 statutory language and saying we would, we the Court 24 would reach this result as we did in the Franklin 25 National Bank case even without any regulation. And

1 second of all is to say the regulations are a reasonable 2 interpretation of the statute. A third is to say that 3 the Comptroller has broad rulemaking authority. And as 4 this Court recognized in De La Cuesta and many other 5 cases, an agency exercising its rulemaking authority can 6 preempt State laws even though the statute itself would 7 not -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think, the question is 9 not whether it can preempt State laws but whether the 10 rulemaking authority can, can eliminate a, a basic 11 division of the statute into a national bank and 12 affiliates of the national bank. The statute makes a 13 clear distinction between the two. And the effect of 14 what, of what the agency has to done here is simply to 15 eliminate that distinction, and to say really it doesn't 16 matter. 17 MR. LONG: No. It -- I -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you are an affiliate of 19 a national bank, you have the same immunity that the 20 national bank has. That's not what the statute says. 21 MR. LONG: I have a two-part answer to that 22 question, Justice Scalia. One is that Section 484 of 23 the section you're referring to does limit the 24 visitorial authority as to national banks, but it is 25 silent as to operating subsidiaries or any other type of
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 affiliate. States do exercise visitorial authority over 2 some affiliates of national banks. That's established. 3 Operating subsidiaries are a special type of affiliate; 4 484, which was enacted during the Civil War, a hundred 5 years before operating subsidiaries were authorized, 6 really doesn't address the question of visitorial 7 authority. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, an operating 9 subsidiary is an affiliate, right? What kind of 10 affiliates did they have before they had operating 11 subsidiaries? Did they rent pool halls, or what? 12 MR. LONG: It's a type of affiliate -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought that 14 any affiliate of a national bank would, would be engaged 15 in essentially banking business. 16 MR. LONG: But, but this really became 17 clear, in answer to your question, in part two of my 18 answer. In 1999 when Congress enacted the 19 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, it directly addressed this 20 question of affiliates of national banks. And this is 21 on page 2A of our appendix. It refers to, it created a 22 new type of affiliate, for the first time, financial 23 subsidiaries which can do anything financial in nature. 24 So they can actually engage in activities that the 25 parent national bank could not.
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 But if you look at the bottom of page 2A of 2 our appendix, this is Section 24A now of the act, it 3 said that financial subsidiaries can also engage in 4 activities that are permitted for national banks to 5 engage in directly, subject to the same terms and 6 conditions that govern the conduct of the activities by 7 a national bank. 8 And then at the bottom of 3A and going over 9 to 4A where they actually define financial subsidiaries, 10 they do so by distinguishing them from the operating 11 subsidiaries which had existed for decades. And at the 12 top of 4A you see that the operating subsidiary again 13 engages only in activities that the national banks may 14 engage in directly and are conducted subject to the same 15 terms and conditions. 16 Then if you'll bear with me a moment longer, 17 on page 12A of our appendix some additional provisions 18 of GLBA -- actually, that's the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 19 GLBA people call it -- said -- this is on 12A -- that 20 securities activities and insurance activities, 21 activities that have been traditionally subject to State 22 regulation, if they're engaged in by a functionally 23 regulated subsidiary, operating subsidiary or a 24 financial subsidiary, then they may be regulated by 25 relevant State securities authorities or State insurance

1 authorities. 2 So Congress was actually quite specific. 3 I mean, your question is about statutory language. You 4 don't find this in 484, which is, since it's a century 5 old, doesn't really get into this. But in this 1999 6 statute, it's all about subsidiaries of national banks. 7 Congress was pretty clear if it's securities, if it's 8 insurance, it can be regulated by States. They were 9 specific about that. If it's a banking activity that 10 the bank itself can undertake, it's subject to the same 11 terms and conditions. 12 And so, going back to the Chief 13 Justice's question, you have this question of would it 14 be a preempted State preempted state law if it were 15 applied to the national bank when the national bank is 16 making a mortgage loan. Not every State law is 17 preempted because not every State law conflicts. But if 18 it does -19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What authority 20 do you have for the proposition that when then Federal 21 law says subject to the same terms and conditions that 22 they're referring To State regulation as opposed to the 23 same Federal regulation that applies to the national 24 banks? 25 MR. LONG: Well, I mean, we have section
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 7.4006, which is the 0CC's regulation interpreting that 2 language in the statute and in its own OPSUB 3 regulations, section 5.34. And we also relied simply on 4 the ordinary meaning of "terms and conditions." It 5 means prerequisites, limitations. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was 7.4006 issued 7 pursuant to -- what did you call it, GLBA? 8 MR. LONG: GLBA? 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. Or did it 10 predate that? 11 MR. LONG: 7.4006 was issued pursuant to 12 24-7, which is this incidental powers provision, and 13 24(a), which I've just been walking you through, which 14 is a provision of GLBA. So it is based partly upon 15 GLBA, and it is an interpretation of the same terms and 16 conditions language. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Conflict preemption 18 basically strikes down a State law that stands as an 19 obstacle to the full enforcement of the Federal law. 20 MR. LONG: Yes. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, with that 22 in mind, suppose that you didn't have either 7.4006 or 23 34.4(a)(B). Neither existed. But we listened to what 24 the agency said as a Court and they explained how the 25 regulation worked. Would you expect to come to

We would say that if you 9 start with 24-7 and the incidental powers of national 10 banks and the undisputed point that one of those 11 incidental powers is for the national bank -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does it conflict 13 with Federal banking authority for the State to audit 14 the books of the mortgage subsidiary? 15 MR. LONG: Well, it has been established 16 since the beginning of the national banking system 17 that -- and this goes back to the history of the first 18 and second Bank of the United States in McCullough 19 against Maryland -- that the national banking system is 20 protected from possibly unfriendly State legislation. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Take my earlier case 22 about the consumer disclosure. Michigan has a law, I 23 assume, that any mortgage lender has to tell the 24 consumer all this information. Would that conflict with 25 the authority of a national bank?

LONG: That an agency and not the -16 certainly the Delaquesta line of cases stand for the 17 proposition that if an agency has preempted State law by 18 regulation, the questions are simply whether the agency 19 has acted within the scope of its delegated authority 20 and whether it is a reasonable accommodation of the 21 conflicting principles and whether there's any reason to 22 think that Congress would have disagreed with it. Are 23 there -- I mean, there are examples. For example, in 24 the world of Federal thrifts OTS has a sort of field 25 preemption as I understand it. It's evolved differently

1 in the world of national banks. That's conflict 2 preemption. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is a functionally 4 regulated subsidiary of a depository institution. 5 MR. LONG: Well, that that again goes to 6 this scheme of GLBA that I was trying to describe. The 7 notion that Congress had is that you're going to 8 regulate by function. So if it's insurance, the State 9 can regulate it whether it's in the subsidiary or in the 10 bank. If it's securities, the SEC and in some 11 circumstances the States can regulate it. But if it's 12 core banking functions like mortgage lending, that's 13 going to be regulated subject to the same terms and 14 conditions that apply when the bank itself conducts 15 those activities. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: And is that a functionally 17 regulated subsidiary? 18 MR. LONG: Yes. 19 JUST SCALIA: If it's just engaging in 20 banking activities? 21 MR. LONG: That is the concept as I 22 understand it.

1 MR.

LONG: Yes, yes. North Carolina and 11 others. 12 I will add, there was a point at the 13 beginning that this Wachovia Mortgage Company actually 14 was regulated by Michigan for 6 years and there were no 15 problems. During that period it was a subsidiary of a 16 bank holding company, and that's a completely different 17 situation. Those are not regulated at all by the OCC. 18 So of course they were regulated by Michigan. That's 19 the way subsidiaries of bank holding companies are 20 regulated.

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS 2 MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 3 Justice, and may it please the Court: 4 Let me begin by addressing this question of 5 whether what's going on here is conflict preemption or 6 field preemption. Now, it depends on how one defines 7 those terms. But as we understand it it's conflict 8 preemption, not field preemption, in the following 9 sense. Our position is not that State laws have no 10 application to operating subsidiaries or to national 11 banks for that matter. It's that State laws apply to 12 the same extent to operating subsidiaries as they would 13 to national banks. And as this court has made clear in 14 the Atherton case and in the Barnett Bank case, State 15 laws do apply to national banks and operating 16 subsidiaries in a variety of respects, and State 17 contract law would be an example. But with operating 18 subsidiaries in particular, State laws dealing with 19 corporate governance questions, for example the process 20 of incorporation, dissolution, shareholder voting, and 21 things of that sort, would be controlling and so federal 22 law doesn't control those sorts of aspects. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's field 24 preemption when it comes to regulation. Yes, if the 25 bank is sued the normal rules of contract are going to
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 apply for enforcing a contract. But you're claiming 2 field preemption with respect to regulation, correct? 3 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I guess it depends on 4 the degree to which the regulations apply to the 5 national banks. That's my only point, is that State 6 laws apply to the same extent to the operating 7 subsidiary as to the national bank. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: State laws generally 9 -- State agencies generally don't regulate national 10 banks at all, right? 11 MR. SRINIVASAN: State agencies don't 12 generally do that because there's a specific statutory 13 prohibition on that. And Justice Scalia, this goes to 14 your questions about the scope of these provisions at 12 15 U.S.C. 484(a) and 481. It's true that those provisions 16 say by their terms that visitorial authority resides 17 exclusively with the Comptroller of the Currency with 18 respect to national banks, and there's another provision 19 that deals with affiliates. 20 And so that's the point with visitorial 21 authority. But visitorial authority by its very nature 22 is asserted in service of and enforcement of some 23 underlying substantive requirement, and the underlying 24 substantive requirement at issue here is the requirement 25 that operating subsidiaries register with the State.
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 And so there's a question of conflict preemption that 2 applies both to the national bank and the operating 3 subsidiary of whether that underlying substantive 4 registration requirement could be applied to the 5 national bank or could be applied to the operating 6 subsidiary. 7 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but it is true, is it 8 not, that as long as this mortgage company was a 9 subsidiary of a holding company rather than the bank 10 itself, the State would have done the visiting, the 11 visitorial power, whereas once they changed the Federal 12 Government assumed that responsibility? 13 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't know what you 14 mean by "holding company," Justice Stevens. 15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, as your co-counsel 16 pointed out, previously this very company was a 17 subsidiary of a holding company that also owned the 18 bank, and at that time it was exclusively regulated by 19 Michigan. 20 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, because it 21 wasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered 22 national bank. 23 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the change in the 24 corporate structure is the sole basis for saying now 25 it's exclusively regulated by the OCC?
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. SRINIVASAN: It is, but it's changing 2 the corporate structure in a fundamentally important 3 way. That's that it's no owned and controlled by a 4 federally chartered national bank. 5 JUSTICE STEVENS: But this results in field 6 preemption to the extent that the exercise of visitorial 7 power is a regulatory function? 8 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, again it depends on 9 how one defines those terms. And I don't take issue 10 with the fact that as a consequence of the fact that 11 this became a subsidiary -12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it is now only the 13 Federal agency that does the visiting, whereas it used 14 to be only the State agency? 15 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. 16 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the question that led 17 me to is how many additional personnel did OOC employ 18 when it took over this area for 48 States? 19 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't have an 20 empirical answer to that question. 21 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it was certainly quite 22 a few people, I assume. 23 MR. SRINIVASAN: But Justice Stevens, in the 24 regulatory materials that attended the promulgation of 25 these rules OCC specifically addressed the question
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 whether it had sufficient resources to exercise 2 oversight authority over operating subsidiaries of 3 national banks. And let's be clear. It's not that the 4 OCC previously had no authority over operating 5 subsidiaries. The question is whether the OCC has 6 exclusive authority over operating subsidiaries. And 7 the OCC determined in the regulatory materials that it 8 had sufficient resources to exercise oversight authority 9 over operating subsidiaries -10 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the authority under 11 the old regime was just to make sure that the operation 12 did not affect the financial stability of the parent 13 bank. 14 MR. SRINIVASAN: But that's because it 15 wasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered 16 national bank, and that changes things in a fundamental 17 way for the following reason: That under the Barnett 18 Bank case the rule of preemption, the special rule of 19 preemption that applies in the context of national 20 banking, is that when you're dealing with enumerated or 21 incidental powers of national banks -- and one 22 incidental power of a national bank is undisputed to be 23 the power to conduct affairs through an operating 24 subsidiary -- that the grants of those powers are 25 normally preemptive of rather than preempted by State

1 law> And so once the operating -2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was an effort 3 of the State to prohibit the national bank from engaging 4 in the activity, correct? 5 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that was. But the 6 Court -7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an obvious 8 case of conflict preemption. Here we have a question of 9 whether or not the State can regular the operating 10 subsidiary to any extent. 11 MR. SRINIVASAN: But the Court's decisions 12 aren't limited to prohibitions of that sort. I'd make 13 two points in that regard. First of all, in one sense 14 this is a prohibition, because the operating subsidiary 15 can't engage in federally authorized activities unless 16 and until it gets the State's permission. So at least 17 there is a prohibition at the outset. But more 18 importantly, the Court's cases aren't limited to 19 situations involving prohibitions of the sort that Your 20 Honor posits, because in the Franklin National Bank case 21 that was a situation in which the national bank had the 22 power to accept savings deposits and the State law that 23 was deemed to be preempted there didn't prohibit the 24 national bank from accepting savings deposits. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: What comes next? Can the
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 OCC say, well, the corporate law of this State doesn't 2 really allow subsidiaries to do as much as we think a 3 subsidiary of a national bank ought to be able to do, so 4 we're going to attribute additional corporate powers to 5 this subsidiary? Can it do that? 6 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, not if you're talking 7 about corporate powers, because those are governed by 8 State law. What it could do, though, is regulate the 9 subsidiary's conduct of the business of banking, 10 because, after all, an operating subsidiary has one 11 purpose and one purpose only, and that's to carry out 12 functions that the national bank itself could perform. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: What troubles me, and maybe 14 you can answer to it more specifically than you have, is 15 that the core function of a banking regulatory agency is 16 the visitation power, and the Banking Act makes it very 17 clear that there is visitation power to national banks 18 and makes it very clear that there is not for 19 subsidiaries. 20 And here is a regulation which under the 21 guise, it seems to me, of defining the powers of the 22 national bank simply eliminates that distinction. And 23 it seems to me that perhaps goes beyond what an agency 24 regulation is allowed to do. 25 MR. SRINIVASAN: With respect,

1 Justice Scalia, I don't think the statutes say that at 2 all. There is a statute, 484(a), that says that the 3 OCC's visitorial authority is exclusive with respect to 4 national banks. But there is no statute that says that 5 the OCC's visitorial authority is not exclusive with 6 respect to subsidiaries. There's another statute that 7 deals with affiliates. Now one point is that affiliates 8 are not limited to subsidiaries, but they could include 9 for example, I guess brother and sister corporations for 10 lack of a better term, that are controlled by a common 11 parent. But another point is that at the time these 12 statutes were enacted, Congress simply didn't have 13 within its field of vision the notion that a national 14 bank would have the power to exercise its functions 15 through a subsidiary corporation. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why should we assume 17 that they wanted to preempt state laws to that extent. 18 MR. SRINIVASAN: Because what Congress was 19 trying to do is to make sure that the OCC had exclusive 20 visitorial authority with respect to the conduct of 21 national bank function. It's just at the time that 22 these statutes were enacted, the only play that national 23 bank functions were being conducted was by a national 24 bank itself. Now later on, when the laws of all 50 25 states, the OTS, the Federal Reserve with respect to
49

1 state member banks, and the comptroller gives banks the 2 authority to conduct national -- to conduct bank 3 functions through its subsidiaries, then this issue 4 arises about who exercises visitorial authority with 5 respect to the conduct of those functions for a 6 subsidiary. And it stands to reason that if the 7 baseline rule is that with respect to the conduct of 8 national bank functions through a national bank itself, 9 the OCC visitorial authority is exclusive, then when a 10 national bank exercises its Federal entitlement to 11 conduct those very same functions through an operating 12 subsidiary, the OCC's visitorial authority, likewise, 13 would be exclusive. That seems to me to be an entirely 14 reasonable regulatory determination by the comptroller, 15 and there's nothing in those statutory provisions that 16 speaks directly to that issue and that in any way 17 precludes the comptroller from reaching that 18 determination. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Practically, is there any 20 difference between the way they operated when they were 21 just a corporation as before, and now a parent and sub? 22 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, there could be. I 23 don't know about this particular case but there 24 absolutely could be, Justice Ginsburg, because when they 25 become subsidiaries they are controlled by the national
50

1 bank and not by some other entity. And the reason that 2 a national bank would choose to engage in this sort of 3 structure rather than folding the enterprise into the 4 bank itself are many fold. And in part it's for 5 efficiency purposes because you can have focused 6 management, especially when you're dealing with the sort 7 of specialized things that operating subsidiaries 8 typically do. But there's also other reasons. For 9 example, there's a modularity component to this in the 10 sense that the best specialized functions such as 11 mortgage lending, very often a national bank will 12 purchase an entity that conducts that activity, and may 13 be interested in selling the entity later, and it's much 14 more straightforward to do that if those functions are 15 maintained in a separate subsidiary corporation. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any aspect 17 of state law, including liability limitation, that they 18 want to take advantage of by establishing a subsidiary 19 chartered under state law, Michigan or another state, 20 and yet they're claiming immunity from all other state 21 regulations? 22 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, with respect to 23 liability limitation in particular, Mr. Chief Justice, I 24 should clarify that veil piercing principles and things 25 of that sort would be governed by state law with respect
51

1 to the operating subsidiary. So if the question is 2 whether the corporate veil is pierced, state law would 3 dictate an answer to that question. 4 But, may I just finish one thought? 5 States won't have an incentive to liberally 6 construe veil piercing principles with respect to 7 national banks precisely because state member banks in 8 all 50 states also have operating subsidiaries through 9 which they charter banks to conduct banking functions. 10 Thank you. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 12 Mr. Blanchard, you have a minute remaining. 13 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOHN BLANCHARD 14 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 15 MR. BLANCHARD: Two key points. 16 First, Section 484 and 481 have been amended 17 subsequent to the time operating subsidiaries came into 18 play. Congress knew of operating subsidiaries when it 19 amended 484 twice in the 1980s, and 481 was amended four 20 times. Yet, never did Congress insert the word 21 "affiliates" into the exclusive power of the OCC in 488. 22 Secondly, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act is 23 being greatly distorted. The same terms and conditions 24 language that my opponent referred to was meant to 25 return op subs only to the authority that the parent
52

1 bank could engage in. It wasn't preemptive or meant to 2 preempt the states. The comptroller had issued a 3 ruling, 34.F, (f), and they had allowed operating 4 subsidiaries to do things differently from the parent 5 bank. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 7 Mr. Blanchard. The case is submitted. 8 (Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the 9 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
