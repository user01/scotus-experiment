In Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, for example, the statute begins by talking about protecting the navigable capacity of the waters of the United States, and immediately switches to talk about preventing obstructions to the navigable waters. In a much more recent statute, 1990, the Aquatic Nuisance Prevention Act, which I did not cite in my brief, but which I have directed the Solicitor General to, it's at 16 USC 4702.

What I don't understand is the position which, I take it is yours, which says that all non-navigable waters which flow percent, the only difference being that they happen to flow into the stream that's navigable under the ground rather than over the ground.

Clearly many of the waters that are covered under the tributaries language of the statutes are not navigable in fact and could not support even a small rowboat."

It used these traditional terms, navigable waters of the United States, and under any plausible understanding of those terms, historical or just common sense, and certainly reading the legislative history, there is absolutely no indication that Congress meant to reach isolated ponds that can have no affect on the quality of navigable waters."

They seem, this section seems to fit the category that you say is outside the statute.  Perhaps you can look at the the United States, and therefore the only thing that 404(g)(1) reaches are the tributaries which are part of the navigable waters but which are not part of the traditional Corps meaning of navigable waters in the Daniel Ball, Appalachian Electric sense.  That seems like -- I mean, the statute does not say isolated waters; there is nothing in there that even hints that isolated waters are part of what is left over."

That leaves an enormous amount of regulatory power to the states over tributaries and their adjacent wetlands, but nothing in statute or in this case a regulation, the bird rule should not be read so as to create constitutional problems. Whatever one's conclusion about the constitutionality of the bird rule, it seems beyond question that it does raise serious questions."

  {
    "speaker": "BISHOP",
    "speech": "The sole basis is the migratory bird rule.  That is what they stated when they took jurisdiction in the first place.  It is the only basis of jurisdiction that is stated in the 404 permit denials. Having said that, we obviously don't want to go back down and find ourselves caught on some other provision of the the activity itself, which I think is an intent to rely on the other waters regulation.  And so we would like the Court to address that to save another $30 million in public money which is what we spent dealing with the Corps for the last 13 years. I was talking about the principles of statutory regulation which we think support our interpretation.  One is the DeBartolo principle, but a second one and one the Congress had very much in mind as Section 101(b) of the statute makes clear is that it was concerned not to trample state powers over land use and over the environment, and there is no doubt that that trampling occurred here.  The Corps put together a 47,000-page record over the course of seven years of permitting, and in doing so overrode the considered determinations of the State of Illinois and Cook County. inconsistent to stretch the jurisdiction as the Corps has through its rules, to stretch the jurisdiction to impinge on state regulation in the face of a clear statement in the preamble of the statute that Congress intended, had a policy to preserve the primary jurisdiction of state and local government over these matters, and that it is inconsistent with the clear statement principle that this Court has applied which requires that if Congress is going to impinge on the reserved rights of the states that it should say so clearly. Far from saying so clearly in this case, it said that it wished to preserve to the extent possible the rights of the states."

Do they have that power?"

It intended that the states have reserve powers to deal with problems as well, and --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But why isn't there going to be a commerce connection?  I mean apart from the Chief Justice's suggestion, it seems to me that the hypothetical that Justice Breyer throws out is a pretty good predicate to substantial effects on commerce."

  {
    "speaker": "BISHOP",
    "speech": "Well, but I don't think that substantial effects on an end user -- here the claim is that the birds, because they fly interstate and at some point may get shot by or watched by people who are me from the hypothetical.  But some end user commerce connection is not enough.  If you get there then there are no reserve powers left to the states, everything is within the enumerated powers.

The committee amendment does not redefine navigable waters.  Instead, the committee amendment intends to assure continued protection of all the nation's waters but allows states to assume the primary responsibility for protecting the waters outside of the so-called Phase I waters, which are the navigable waters and those adjacent and then the wetlands adjacent thereto. Under the committee amendment the Corps will continue to administer the entire Section 404 program in all navigable waters until the approval of a state program for Phase II eight states that have filed a brief in our support in this case.  Only one has filed a brief on the other side, I hasten to point out.

And perhaps if we get away from this particular cite for a moment, much of the battle would be about the so-called prairie potholes in the Dakotas and adjoining states where about 50 percent of the waterfowl in this country breed.  Under petitioner's position, as I understand it, the commerce power would enable Congress to protect the winter habitat of duck species and other waterfowl in the Chesapeake Bay area with all of its tidal waters and navigable rivers and et cetera, but not to protect the summer breeding habitat of these same waterfowl."

It's that the navigable waters it's ineffectual to be able to protect the habitat that they use in one season but not to be able to protect the habitat that they use in another season, the breeding season."

    "speaker": "WALLACE",
    "speech": "That is correct, and the so-called prairie potholes are perhaps the prime example of that. The waters here, that's a more difficult inquiry. Certainly they serve as storage for what would otherwise be flood waters during periods of heavy rain that would cause overflow. That was part of what the Corps had to deal with in dealing with this application. affect the navigable waters to the states.  It's a perfectly rational approach."

Here you have a 47,000-page report, did I hear that correctly, that the Corps of Engineers issued?"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It seems to me that this illustrates that the way in which the Corps has promulgated its regulation departs from the design of the statute. what turned out to be a very complex inquiry, although petitioner characterizes that it's trenching on local land use planning functions, but local land use boards seldom have to deal with a project of this magnitude, and its potential and long-range effects on the people who will be affected by it in their posterity, which is why the states supporting us say that the special expertise of the Corps and of the other agencies, state and Federal, that weighed in in this process, and of course responses were received from petitioner and its supporters, were so important, because what was implicated here was not only dangers to migratory birds but a question of possible contamination of an aquifer used by thousands of people for their drinking water."

    "speech": "Justice O'Connor, the State of Illinois rejected our first permit application, made us reapply.  We filed a 1700-page application, there were an additional set of public hearings. They subjected the project to 51 conditions before they would let us proceed. Cook County engaged in the largest, longest permit proceeding it had ever engaged in over this project. Let me say that the act is not open ended. It's not that any connection will do.  The Corps -- and one of the amicus briefs on the other side from the wetland scientists claims that isolated ponds are in fact somehow connected on the surface or through groundwater to the navigable waters, but the fact is any change made in the of the commerce power, so -- and as to groundwater, I did not and certainly do not mean to suggest that the Corps can regulate any water that flows into groundwater.  The law is clear in the 7th Circuit that the Corps does not have jurisdiction over groundwater.  Other courts, the 5th Circuit, for example, has held that if the groundwater recharges surface water, there's jurisdiction.  That's simply an issue that is not in this case, and I do not concede that if there is any connection to the groundwater here that that would be jurisdictional. And the record in this case which is 47,000 pages long contains no basis of jurisdiction, no sourcible authority at all other than presence of migratory birds on these waters. The parade of horrors that Mr. Wallace has trotted out should also not be believed.  The Clean Water Act is not out there by itself protecting clean water, or the other waters rule, this strand from the Corps' jurisdiction will have and should have no impact on what Congress can do under the other statutes. If you address this case as a statutory rather than a constitutional case, it would also want to address the question whether Congress can come back with a different plan to protect clean waters. What we don't believe the government can plausibly assert is that the terms navigable waters defined as waters of the United States, given the history, given the legislative history, given the historical usage of those terms, in this Court and other statutes, extends to isolated ponds regulated by the states. And finally on the -- as to the rule of lenity, I would recommend that the Court follow the --"
