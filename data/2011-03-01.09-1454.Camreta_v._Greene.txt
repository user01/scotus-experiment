1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:17 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 09-1454, Camreta v. Greene, 5 and 09-1478, Alford v. Greene. 6 General Kroger. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. KROGER 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. KROGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 In Pearson v. Callahan, this Court gave the 12 lower Federal courts discretionary power to decide 13 substantive questions of constitutional law in qualified 14 immunity cases in order to further the development of 15 constitutional precedent. If it is valuable for the 16 lower courts to decide these cases, then it is essential 17 that this Court be able to review those decisions in 18 order to ensure that they are accurate. For this 19 reason, the case is justiciable and should be reviewed 20 on the merits. 21 Turning to the merits of this case, the 22 Court of Appeals held - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not so fast. 24 (Laughter.) 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, there are two

1 issues here, and I hope we do get to th substance. Can 2 you tell me Camreta's current occupation? Does the 3 record establish that? Does the record tell us what 4 Camreta is doing now? Is - 5 MR. KROGER: The record does not, Your 6 Honor, because the mootness issue was raised relatively 7 late in the proceedings, but I'm aware of what his 8 current occupation is. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Which is? 10 MR. KROGER: He is a child protective 11 services worker with the Oregon Department of Human 12 Services. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: What I was about to ask is 14 this: I can agree with you that -- that where there is 15 a -- a determination on the merits, it should be 16 reviewable, but could still disagree that it's 17 reviewable where the requirements for Article III are 18 not met; that is, where there is really no justiciable 19 controversy between the parties. 20 What -- what is the interest of the -- of 21 the parties who were victorious here? 22 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, the interest of Mr. 23 Camreta is the ongoing harm he has in his job. Under 24 the Ninth Circuit's decision, he is forced to either 25 forgo a regular and recurring duty of his job, which is
5

1 to interview potential child victims in school, or to 2 face liability for doing so. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would he face 4 liability? Because he didn't have the opportunity to 5 challenge that decision, the Fourth Amendment decision; 6 therefore, it would have no preclusive effect on him. A 7 party who doesn't have the -- if there are alternative 8 holdings and you lose on one, win on the other, you're 9 not precluded by the loss because you didn't have an 10 opportunity to raise it on appeal. So why would Camreta 11 be precluded? Why would he face punitive damages as 12 you're suggesting? 13 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit 14 opinion does apply to Mr. Camreta. The court 15 specifically advised Mr. Camreta and others in his 16 position that they are on notice that in-school 17 interviews of students that require a seizure require a 18 warrant, and, thus, the Ninth Circuit decision does have 19 precedential effect and impacts Mr. Camreta. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it takes - 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General - 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: It takes two to tango, and 23 a case or controversy requires somebody on the other 24 side who cares a fig about the outcome. And here, S.G., 25 who was the -- the young woman affected in the case, has
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 moved to another State and -- making it virtually 2 certain that she'll never confront this situation again. 3 She doesn't care what the result of this thing is. 4 Besides which, I think she's, what, 17 years old or so 5 now? It's impossible that she will be confronted with 6 the same situation. 7 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, I disagree that 8 S.G. has no ongoing concrete stake in the outcome of 9 this case. In footnote 20 of the Respondent's brief on 10 page 33, the Respondent notes that they have filed a 11 motion in the United States district court to bring 12 their Fourth Amendment claim against Deschutes County, a 13 potential party that has no qualified immunity as a 14 defense. And, obviously, the legal viability of that - 15 that claim against Deschutes County will depend very 16 much on the ruling on the merits of this Court. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is a Monell claim, 18 and it's -- and the district court has held its ruling, 19 I take it, in abeyance pending -- a ruling for 20 reinstatement of that claim, pending our decision here? 21 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor. 22 The district court ruled that it was premature until 23 these proceedings were concluded. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why isn't the 25 answer, then, that that's the right case to take up?

1 Because in this case, we have a plaintiff who is not 2 going to be confronted with this situation again and who 3 has put herself out of the running for damages because 4 she didn't -- she didn't challenge the qualified 5 immunity ruling. So she has no stake in any monetary 6 relief from this claim. She has no continuing -- the - 7 what has happened to her, happened to her at age 9, will 8 never happen again now that she's past 18. 9 So she hasn't -- if she came to court today 10 with her case as an 18-year-old, she would have no case 11 or controversy. It just seems like the whole case has 12 evaporated. She has no claim. She did have a claim 13 for -- for money damages, but she has relinquished that. 14 So, what -- what genuine controversy is before us? 15 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, the controversy 16 remains the Fourth Amendment claim, which is the 17 Respondent is seeking to pursue in the United States 18 district court and that gives the Respondent here a 19 direct financial stake in the viability of their Fourth 20 Amendment argument, and - 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Isn't 22 that -- isn't that the -- the county's claim? How 23 Camreta does his job doesn't -- that claim doesn't 24 belong to him; it belongs to the entity who is telling 25 him how to do his job. And so why don't we go back to

1 Justice Ginsburg's question of why isn't the Monell 2 situation the proper case? Because there, it's the 3 party interested in how its officers will do their job 4 at its directive. It has the case and controversy at 5 issue, not S.G. 6 Right now, she's never going to be 7 investigated again. She's in another State. I 8 understand that she doesn't even ever want to return to 9 Oregon for, probably, fairly good reasons, at least from 10 her perspective. So, again, why isn't this the 11 interests of the county, not -- not the interests of the 12 officer? 13 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, in Arizonans v. 14 Arizona, the Court recognized that the employee in that 15 case had an interest in how she was able to conduct her 16 job. The Court decided that the case was -- was moot 17 because she had resigned from her position with the 18 State. But there was no objection to -- to her standing 19 because she was a public employee that wanted to perform 20 her job in a particular way because she was required to 21 under State law, and here - 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: She was the plaintiff. 23 In Arizona, we were talking about whether a plaintiff 24 still had a viable claim, right? 25 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.

1 JUSTICE KAGAN: General Kroger, I don't 2 think that the question here is really a standing 3 question; it's really whether there is a controversy 4 between this particular plaintiff and this particular 5 defendant such that a judgment in this case would 6 actually affect the legal relationship between the two, 7 between the particular plaintiff and the particular 8 defendant. 9 So how would it do that? How would a legal 10 judgment in this case affect the legal relationship 11 between this plaintiff and this defendant? 12 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, the -- the -- Mr. 13 Camreta remains a party below, and it's possible that 14 the Court's rulings on the Fourth Amendment merits may 15 impact the Fourteenth Amendment claims that are being 16 made against Mr. Camreta that are alive and in 17 controversy below. 18 Moreover, this case, even if one strips out 19 the ongoing motion that's been made in the district 20 court, resembles in all material respects Erie v. 21 Pap's A.M., where the Court found that there was 22 standing to bring the case and it was not moot. And so, 23 there does seem to be an active case or controversy that 24 is equivalent to that that was present in Erie v. 25 Pap's A.M.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: How does it affect the 2 Fourteenth Amendment? There's a Fourteenth Amendment 3 claim pending below? 4 MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: And what's the substance of 6 that? 7 MR. KROGER: It is a claim of Mrs. Greene to 8 interference with familial rights as a result of certain 9 actions by Mr. Camreta and other defendants. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that didn't have to 11 do with the school search -- the school seizure? 12 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- and this case 14 presents the question about was this unreasonable? That 15 -- what's left in the case has to do with the mother's 16 claim, and it has to do with putting the girls in 17 custody, right? 18 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor. 19 So the - 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, if we were to 21 hold this case was moot, what would -- what do you think 22 the appropriate disposition of the case would be? 23 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, I believe if the 24 Court determined that this case was moot, the -- the 25 appropriate remedy would be pursuant to Munson where -

What would be -- what would we be vacating? 5 They haven't rendered a judgment on the search warrant 6 issue. 7 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor. 8 What -- what I think the appropriate remedy for the 9 Court would be would be to effectively - 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Vacate the opinion. 11 MR. KROGER: -- vacate the opinion or 12 decision on the Fourth Amendment claim. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: That would make you happy, 14 won't it? Won't that make you happy? 15 MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the -16 I think the only difficulty with that as a -- as a 17 outcome of the case is it undercuts the logic of the 18 Pearson decision. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't just do 20 that. Is -- is Mr. Camreta in any more comfortable 21 position when he knows that the Ninth -- what the Ninth 22 Circuit thinks on this issue and he just has to wait 23 until there's another case when they can impose the view 24 that they've already spelled out? I know as a technical 25 matter it's not binding, but if you're Camreta, do you

It 5 would place Mr. Camreta and other child protective 6 services workers in the Ninth Circuit in a very - 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: There are different panels 8 on the Ninth Circuit, aren't there? 9 MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and they don't all 11 hold the same thing, fortunately, do they? 12 (Laughter.) 13 MR. KROGER: They do they do not, Your 14 Honor. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're supposed to 16 file circuit -- follow circuit precedent, aren't they? 17 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: But an opinion that is 19 vacated is not circuit precedent, is it? 20 MR. KROGER: It is not, Your Honor. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Camreta would be 22 protected. He would presumably still be entitled to 23 qualified immunity because a vacated alternative holding 24 certainly could not really establish something, I would 25 assume. But municipalities, if they continue to

1 participate in -- in questioning of this nature, would 2 not be protected; isn't that right? 3 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What happened in - 5 what -- what has Oregon done in response to this Ninth 6 Circuit decision? Before it said that the caseworkers 7 could have this kind of interview with the -- the child 8 where there was a suspicion of abuse. Was there any 9 change in practice in Oregon in response to the Ninth 10 Circuit's decision? 11 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, that is not in the 12 record, but I would happy -- be happy to respond. The 13 State of Oregon provided legal advice advising child 14 protective services workers to attempt to avoid anything 15 that would be a seizure in a school and, in cases where 16 there would pose no risk of danger to the children, to 17 seek consent of -- of a parent before conducting an 18 interview. Nevertheless, that legal advice puts a 19 significant burden on the child protective services 20 workers to -- to do their utmost to protect Oregon's 21 children. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On the merits - 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me - 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- do you think that 25 the same approach you're following here would apply if

1 the investigation focused on the student rather than a 2 third party? Would in those cases a warrant have to be 3 obtained? 4 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, I think in -- in 5 those cases, because parental consent is a viable 6 alternative where the allegation is a child is being 7 abused by another child - 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, not another 9 child. It could be anything. We think the child is, 10 you know, selling drugs, obviously not a 7-year-old, but 11 someone else in the school is involved in legal 12 activity, him- or herself. 13 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, I believe the - 14 the child abuse context is somewhat unique in that there 15 are very few ways to investigate properly child abuse 16 without speaking to the only witness that's typically 17 available in the case, and that is the child. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so you think 19 it would be a different rule if we're talking about some 20 other criminal activity? The father's selling drugs, 21 and you think the child might have some evidence or at 22 least be willing to talk about that. Do you need 23 anything other than reasonableness in that case? 24 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, it would be the 25 same reasonableness standard that would apply, but I

Do you agree that search -- strike 5 that -- that seizure under the Fourth Amendment is the 6 relevant category here? 7 MR. KROGER: Absolutely, Your Honor. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You agree that the child 9 was -- was seized? 10 MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor, we concede 11 that the child was seized. 12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what happens if 13 the teacher tells -- the student is misbehaving on the 14 playground: Go back in the classroom. You can't -- you 15 sit there by yourself. You can't be part of recess. 16 Is that a seizure? 17 MR. KROGER: No, Your Honor, I -- I disagree 18 that that would be a seizure, because - 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What made this a seizure? 20 The fact that it wasn't a teacher? 21 MR. KROGER: Your Honor, the reason we 22 conceded the issue of seizure is we are here on -- on 23 summary judgment, and we took the facts as alleged, 24 which involved transporting the student inside the 25 school.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I'm -- I'm 2 asking for your view of the proper category to apply in 3 these cases, and if it is a seizure, then -- then it's 4 just a question of reasonableness, and we'd look at all 5 the circumstances. 6 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor. 7 Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the 8 balance of my time. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 10 Ms. Kruger. 11 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER, 12 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 13 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 14 MS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 15 please the Court: 16 A number of the questions this morning have 17 focused on the question whether a live case or 18 controversy remains because Respondent has chosen not to 19 challenge the Ninth Circuit's qualified immunity ruling 20 and so purportedly has no continuing stake in the 21 resolution of this controversy. We think that that's 22 not correct for the reasons General Kroger has given, 23 but it's also not an irreducible minimum of this Court's 24 jurisdiction to correct the mistake that the Ninth 25 Circuit made in this case. I think, too -

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- did she - 2 did she -- let's go back one step. Does she have any 3 viable claim now? This is not capable of repetition, 4 evasive of review? 5 MS. KRUGER: Well, two responses, Justice 6 Ginsburg. First, as General Kroger mentioned, she has a 7 continuing interest in how this Court resolves this 8 controversy because of her attempt to bring the same 9 Fourth Amendment claim against Deschutes County. But 10 setting that aside, this Court hasn't universally 11 required that as a prerequisite to exercising its 12 jurisdiction. I think there are two examples that help 13 to illustrate the point. 14 The first is the City of Erie v. Pap's A.M. 15 case, in which this Court decided to review a State 16 court injunction entered in favor of a plaintiff who no 17 longer had what we would think of as an Article III 18 stake in the case by the time the case reached this 19 Court. 20 The plaintiff in that case had left the nude 21 dancing business and had affirmatively stated they had 22 no intention to return. The Court, nevertheless, 23 reached the merits of the State court decision that was 24 on review because to do otherwise would be to saddle the 25 City of Erie with an ongoing injury. In the -

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: There was a dissent in that 2 case, wasn't there? 3 MS. KRUGER: There was indeed a dissent in 4 that case. But I would note that there was also - 5 (Laughter.) 6 MS. KRUGER: -- a dissent from the denial of 7 cert in Bunting v. Mellen, in which very much the same 8 situation was presented. The cadets who brought the 9 challenge to the VMI supper prayer that was at issue in 10 that case had graduated from VMI by the time this case 11 reached this Court. And I think, as you quite properly 12 noted in your dissent from denial of review in that 13 case, for this Court to essentially insulate those types 14 of constitutional rulings from review would be to 15 undermine the very purposes for which this Court - 16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Kruger, how does this - 17 this situation, the qualified immunity situation, differ 18 from a wide variety of other situations in which we 19 might not be able to get to the underlying 20 constitutional ruling? 21 For example, in any case where there's a 22 constitutional ruling but also a harmless error ruling, 23 or in a Sixth Amendment case where there are standards 24 about ineffective assistance of counsel but then a 25 finding that there's no prejudice. In all of those
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 kinds of cases, the underlying substantive ruling might 2 be insulated from our review. How would you say that 3 the qualified immunity situation is different and how 4 would you be able to cabin this rule? 5 MS. KRUGER: The reason we think the 6 qualified immunity situation is different, it presents a 7 set of exceptional circumstances that weren't an 8 exception to the usual prudential rule, is because the 9 qualified immunity situation is one in which this Court 10 has encouraged courts to undertake these kinds of 11 constitutional rulings for the purpose of changing the 12 legal landscape going forward, for the very purpose of 13 establishing the law so that the -- that qualified 14 immunity doesn't remain perpetually available to 15 officials even though they are engaging in conduct - 16 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, presumably, in every 17 case - 18 MS. KRUGER: -- that has been found 19 unconstitutional. 20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Excuse me. Presumably, in 21 every case in which a court does these paired rulings, 22 if you will -- it doesn't just say that the error was 23 harmless, but says that there was an error -- there's a 24 purpose to clarify the law. How is this different, once 25 again?

1 MS. KRUGER: I think that in this situation 2 what we have is not just a preview of how the court of 3 appeals would decide the case subsequently in a case in 4 which it was actually necessary to reach a certain 5 judgment. What we have is a decision that changes the 6 legal landscape going forward. It establishes the law 7 such that qualified immunity will not be available in 8 the next case. And it means that people like Petitioner 9 Camreta and other child protective services workers who 10 are doing their best to protect children from abuse are 11 now on notice that if they attempt to detain temporarily 12 a child in school for the purposes of trying to confirm 13 or dispel a reasonable suspicion of child abuse without 14 a warrant supported by probable cause, that they will 15 invite lawsuits that would put them on the line for 16 personal monetary damages. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that wouldn't be the 18 case if the opinion were vacated - 19 MS. KRUGER: That's true. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- under Munsingwear? 21 MS. KRUGER: That's true, Justice Scalia, 22 and I think that if that's the disposition that this 23 Court thinks is appropriate, we would be certainly be 24 happier with that than a rule that says - 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would be -
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MS. KRUGER: -- an incorrect constitutional 2 ruling. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would be a 4 partial vacatur, right? The Court's done that before, 5 hasn't it, where we vacate part of a decision under 6 Munsingwear? 7 MS. KRUGER: That's correct, Mr. Chief 8 Justice. But I would note that a vacatur rule would 9 come with certain costs that I think this Court should 10 keep in mind as it decides what the appropriate 11 disposition of this case is. 12 The reason that Respondent has so vigorously 13 objected to that disposition is because it is 14 inconsistent in some ways with the very reason for 15 permitting courts of appeals to undertake this kind of 16 constitutional determination in the first place. It 17 undermines the -- the development of the constitutional 18 law if this Court simply wipes the -- the slate clean 19 but doesn't exercise its own authority to clarify the 20 law by correcting what the Ninth Circuit has done. And 21 I think, as the Chief Justice has quite correctly 22 pointed out, it also does nothing to dispel the cloud of 23 uncertainty that hangs over individuals within the 24 territorial jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm not so

1 sure he was correct. The - 2 (Laughter.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's vacated, it 4 indicates that there's no established law on that 5 question, and it seems to me Camreta would be free to do 6 what he considered appropriate under the circumstances, 7 and if somebody tries to impose personal liability on 8 him, it seems he has an even stronger case than he might 9 have before. 10 MS. KRUGER: I think that's correct, Mr. 11 Chief Justice, and I think for that reason we would not 12 object to that disposition in this case. We would just 13 observe that that disposition is one that does not sit 14 particularly comfortably with the reasoning of Pearson 15 and the line of cases that comes before it, that 16 recognizes that the reason why we encourage courts of 17 appeals to undertake these determinations in the first 18 place is to promote the development of constitutional 19 law and to ensure that the law doesn't remain not 20 clearly established in perpetuity. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me it would 22 affect Camreta's behavior and that of other child 23 protective officers. The lawyer would explain: Now, 24 legally this is not binding; it just never happened. 25 But three judges of the court of appeals in a reasoned
23

1 decision have explained why this is contrary to the 2 Constitution, and it would seem to me that any 3 conscientious law enforcement officer would -- would 4 take that seriously into account. 5 MS. KRUGER: I think that's absolutely 6 right, Justice Kennedy. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? What's the test? 8 Isn't the test clearly established law? 9 MS. KRUGER: That's right. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would this be clearly 11 established law under any -- any conceivable 12 interpretation of that? 13 MS. KRUGER: I think it's -- it's true that 14 if this Court were to vacate the Ninth Circuit's 15 constitutional ruling, Mr. Camreta and others who are 16 similarly situated wouldn't face the very significant 17 concrete prospective effect of this decision, which is 18 to strip them of qualified immunity in future cases. 19 They would be able to argue, as you're suggesting, that 20 the law is not clearly established. At the same time - 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we told them - 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You have very limited 23 time. Could you -- could you go to the merits of the 24 Fourth Amendment question and give us the Government's 25 position on that?

1 MS. KRUGER: Certainly, Justice Ginsburg. 2 The Ninth Circuit in this case held that the temporary 3 detention of a child in school to confirm or dispel 4 suspicions that that child is being abused is 5 unconstitutional unless the questioning officials have a 6 warrant, probable cause, or parental consent. We think 7 each of those requirements is unjustified as a matter of 8 Fourth Amendment law and imposes a serious burden on the 9 conduct of the -- of the government at the initial 10 stages of a child abuse investigation. As - 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, would -- I'm 12 interrupting you only for a quick reason. What's the 13 test? Is it a question of whether the seizure is 14 reasonable or not? 15 MS. KRUGER: That's correct, Justice 16 Sotomayor. The question is reasonableness. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So -- so 18 that would be your proposed test. If we were to say you 19 don't need any of those three things right now, where 20 would that leave us or leave the courts below on 21 determining whether what happened here was reasonable or 22 not? Meaning, what if a child is called in and says, I 23 don't want to talk to you without my mom; and they 24 continue to speak to the child? Is that reasonable? 25 MS. KRUGER: I think that the answer is that

1 would go to the -- the question of the manner in which 2 the -- the interview is conducted, as opposed to whether 3 it's - 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do we - 5 MS. KRUGER: -- reasonable at its inception. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do we develop the 7 law, or how do we help develop the law in this case if 8 we answer your question but leave unanswered with no 9 parameters, any idea -- because we have no set of facts; 10 no one's going to review that question -- of what is 11 reasonable in this context? 12 MS. KRUGER: Well, the question that the 13 Ninth Circuit answered in this case was a question that 14 concerns the justification for the interview at its 15 inception. The Ninth Circuit said a warrant, probable 16 cause, or parental consent is required from the very 17 outset. That would be true whether an interview lasted 18 2 hours or 10 minutes, whether the child was responsive, 19 whether the child wasn't. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- you see, that's 21 the problem with taking up a case with no case in 22 controversy, because what do we do? We don't remand for 23 them to reach the second question, which is really the 24 one that law enforcement needs some help on. 25 MS. KRUGER: Well, I -- I would disagree

1 with that proposition. I think law enforcement very 2 much needs help on the questions the Ninth Circuit 3 actually decided because the warrant or probable cause 4 requirement is one that has a very significant effect on 5 the way that they carry out their very important 6 business in this area. 7 If the Court has no further questions - 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 9 Ms. Kubitschek. 10 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAROLYN A.

But 7 on the other hand, you had no -- you could have filed a 8 paper saying we have no continuing interest in the case, 9 but you haven't done that. You've fought the legal 10 issues on the merits in -- in an area where it's been 11 suggested you don't have a stake. 12 MS. KUBITSCHEK: We -- S.G. does not have a 13 legally cognizable stake, Your Honor. She won a moral 14 victory when she obtained a ruling in her favor on the 15 Fourth Amendment claim in the Ninth Circuit, but as this 16 Court said in Hewitt v. Helms, a moral victory is no 17 victory at all, but - 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you have 19 objection if we entered a Munsingwear order vacating the 20 decision of the Ninth Circuit on the merits of the 21 dispute? 22 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, the -- we 23 would submit that the Munsingwear test would not apply 24 in this case because Munsingwear, which permitted 25 vacating a decision when it became moot, talked about

I'm sorry. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Again, I 6 get to the question, why do you care? Why do you care 7 whether we vacate the -- the order or not? Your 8 position is your client has no continuing interest in 9 the case. 10 MS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- our client has no 11 legally binding, legally cognizable interest in the 12 case. She has an interest in protecting her moral 13 victory, as do -- and in the issue, as do the many amici 14 who filed briefs on her behalf. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: She's asserting the 16 interests of other children who would be in the 17 situation that she was once in, but no longer; but we 18 have said the plaintiff herself must have a live 19 controversy, and there was no class action here. 20 MS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that is correct, 21 Justice Ginsburg. She does not have an interest, and 22 the case is moot. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: But you want to have the 24 Fourth Amendment decision preserved and have it govern 25 an enormous chunk of the country so that all the States

1 in the Ninth Circuit have to comply with it, and anybody 2 -- any individual officer who doesn't comply with it 3 would do so on pain of personal liability, but you don't 4 want that ground-breaking decision to be subject to 5 review by this Court on the merits. Is that a summary 6 of what you want? Does that make any sense? 7 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Your Honor, the -- the case 8 -- if the case is truly as important to other employees 9 of the States in -- within the confines of the Ninth 10 Circuit, it will arise again, and this Court will have 11 the opportunity to decide the issue again between 12 parties who have a live stake in the issue; or it will 13 arise in another circuit, and it will present a live 14 controversy between parties who have a stake. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you want us -- so 16 Munsingwear. You don't want us just to leave it sitting 17 because there's no controversy; you want us to erase 18 that holding below, right? 19 MS. KUBITSCHEK: No, Your Honor, we would 20 not ask the holding below be erased. That's - 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then the 22 answer you just gave doesn't make any sense.

In the 15 Ninth Circuit, it's not going to come up again if we 16 assume that our public employees are going to be 17 law-abiding. They're bound by this in the Ninth 18 Circuit. 19 MS.

1 And our reading of the court of appeals decision is not 2 nearly as broad as the Petitioners' reading. The court 3 of appeals said specifically our caseworkers and police 4 officers are always allowed to question children in a 5 protractive custodial setting with - 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where are you reading in 7 the holding of the court of appeals? Because I was 8 under the impression that they did say there's only 9 three ways: One is you get a warrant; another is you 10 get parental consent; and a third is exigent 11 circumstances. I thought that was the -- the ruling of 12 law by the Ninth Circuit. 13 MS. KUBITSCHEK: That was -- that was the 14 ruling as it applied to S.G. herself, Justice Ginsburg. 15 This was not a class action lawsuit, and the court was 16 deciding what happened to one 9-year-old child on 17 February 24th, 2003. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's see where 19 they -- I thought that, yes, the case is about a single 20 plaintiff; it's not a class action. But they're making 21 a rule of law. What does the Fourth Amendment require? 22 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Okay. On page 1022, Your 23 Honor, it says: "We consider the relatively 24 straightforward question whether an in-school seizure 25 and interrogation of a suspected child abuse victim is
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 always permissible under the Fourth Amendment without 2 probable cause and a warrant or the equivalent of a 3 warrant." And the court -- and the court said: No, not 4 always and not in this case. 5 And if this Court does reach the merits 6 of -- of this case, we would ask this Court to uphold a 7 rule that -- stating that a protracted custodial 8 interview of a child by police and child welfare 9 investigators is presumptively unconstitutional unless 10 they have a warrant or court order or parental consent 11 or exigent circumstances. 12 JUSTICE ALITO: What is there in the Ninth 13 Circuit's opinion, which -- which generally requires a 14 warrant, to suggest that the length of the interrogation 15 was relevant to their decision? I mean, at least the 16 child protective services need to decide whether they 17 need a warrant before they begin the questioning, no 18 matter how long it's going to last. 19 Where does it say that the length is 20 relevant to the -- to the issue that they decided? 21 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, the - 22 the length of the questioning has been historically 23 important to this Court's jurisprudence. It 24 distinguishes, for example, between a Terry stop and a 25 seizure. And this Court said, for example, in the
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 United States v. Place, that a 90-minute detention is - 2 falls out of the realm of a Terry stop and into the 3 realm of a seizure for which full Fourth Amendment 4 protections are required of a criminal suspect. And 5 this Court has also said, in Soldal v. Cook County, that 6 it would be anomalous if people who are not suspected of 7 any wrongdoing at all had fewer Fourth Amendment 8 protections than - 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. It 10 seems like a very strange rule to me. You mean it's 11 okay for a child protection worker to just ask the child 12 passing in the hall, you know, has your -- or not 13 passing in the hall. Come into this room, I have a 14 question for you: Has your father been abusing you? 15 And if the child says yes, thank you, and the child 16 goes, then that's okay? 17 MS. KUBITSCHEK: We would - 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because it was a short 19 interview? 20 MS. KUBITSCHEK: The -- I didn't mean to - 21 that the length of the interview is the only factor, 22 Your Honor. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. 24 MS. KUBITSCHEK: One of the other factors is 25 that the -- that the seizure is determined by the fact
34

1 that the police and child welfare worker removed the 2 child or removed any individual from the place where she 3 is - 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Take her into a 5 room. I see that. 6 MS. KUBITSCHEK: -- and bring her to another 7 place, and then - 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: But once they take her in a 9 room, it depends on how long the interview is; is that 10 right? 11 MS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that goes to the 12 question of whether or not there was a seizure. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Whatever. 14 MS. KUBITSCHEK: In this case, it was 15 stipulated that there was a seizure. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: We're talking about rules 17 for the future; we're not talking about this case, and 18 you're asking us to adopt a rule for the future that 19 says if it's very brief, it's okay, but if it's longer 20 it isn't okay. Right? That's what you want us to 21 adopt? 22 MS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that if -- if it 23 were very brief and the child was not removed from her 24 classroom - 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, no. Removed.

1 There has been a seizure, but it's been a very brief 2 seizure, just as a Terry stop is a very brief seizure. 3 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Our position would be that 4 because the -- of the importance of consent here to a 5 seizure, that the -- that there would need to be a court 6 order to remove a child from her classroom and to take 7 her to another room and then - 8 JUSTICE ALITO: On the issue - 9 MS. KUBITSCHEK: -- or parental consent. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're changing your 11 position: You need a court order, no matter how brief; 12 is that it? 13 MS. KUBITSCHEK: I think that has been our 14 position, and I'm sorry if I didn't make it clear. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay. 16 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, on the issue of 17 consent, do you read the Ninth Circuit's opinion as 18 having an age limit? Suppose that the child is, let's 19 say, 16 years old. Is the child at 16 incapable of 20 consenting to questioning? 21 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, the way that we read 22 the Court of Appeals decision and the rule that we would 23 ask this Court to adopt, that is, seizure and for a 24 custodial interrogation is presumptively unreasonable 25 without parental consent or a court order leaves open

1 the possibility that there are, in fact, some children 2 who are of suitable age and discretion to knowingly make 3 a decision whether or not to talk to an armed police 4 officer and a caseworker without their parents having to 5 make it for them. But - 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, are you -- I 7 just want to make sure I understand your position. 8 Answering Justice Scalia's question: Child walks into 9 the room -- is taken out of their classroom, walks into 10 the room. The officer says: We've heard that your 11 mommy and daddy are doing some things to your private 12 parts; is that true? And the child says -- 9-year-old 13 child says: I wish somebody had asked me before. I'm 14 so afraid of my daddy. He does these horrible things to 15 me. 16 Are you seriously suggesting that if the 17 police stay there for an hour debriefing that child as 18 to the circumstances of that situation, that that's a 19 seizure? It seems to me that what you - 20 MS. KUBITSCHEK: A seizure, yes, but that 21 would have exigent circumstances, and that would get it 22 out of the warrant requirement. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but what does that 24 have to do or change the police bringing a child into a 25 room and just asking the question?

KUBITSCHEK: That -- that's correct. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You got a stipulation 10 that there was a seizure, so - 11 MS. KUBITSCHEK: What? Yes, there was a 12 seizure. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was never any 14 argument that was not at issue in this case. Given that 15 there was seizure - 16 MS.

In this particular case, the - 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the information 10 elicited from the child is that she has been abused by 11 her father, then there is a likelihood that there will 12 be police interest in that. 13 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, and this -- this 14 Court recognized also that possibility in Ferguson v. 15 The City of Charleston, that the -- the nurses at the 16 hospital would call child protective services, but 17 the -- the -- you have to look at it from the beginning, 18 and in this case, the case began when -- on 19 February 10th, when the police got involved. 20 The police did not report the matter to the 21 child protective investigator until 10 days later, and 22 then they went out together. Subsequently, the child 23 protective investigator testified before a grand jury as 24 part of the ongoing law enforcement investigation and, 25 in fact, when he was questioned at his deposition,

KUBITSCHEK: No, it would not be the 8 same if it was the school nurse or Mr. Camreta. And 9 the -- the reason is that the school nurse is part of 10 the school administration, and the school has an 11 obligation and the authority under T.L.O. act and in 12 Earls to make rules and carry out procedures that will 13 protect the children of the school and promote learning, 14 and if the child comes - 15 JUSTICE ALITO: So if it was just 16 Mr. Camreta and he - 17 MS.

Right? 22 MS. KUBITSCHEK: If Mr. Camreta came in from 23 the outside, he would not fall within the T.L.O. rule, 24 because in T.L.O. this Court said specifically that 25 their ruling does not apply to individuals such as

1 something else that is going to very much harm that 2 child, why is that any different? 3 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, because 4 child welfare investigations are also harmful to 5 children. And when -- when a child is asked, 6 interrogated about whether or not her father touches her 7 inappropriately, that's not a neutral action. Whether 8 or not she has been abused that causes trauma to the 9 child - 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: It has nothing to do with 11 whether there's a seizure, nothing whatever to do with 12 whether there's a seizure. 13 MS. KUBITSCHEK: If -- if there - 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: The questions you ask after 15 the seizure don't make it a seizure or make it not a 16 seizure, do they? 17 MS. KUBITSCHEK: They -- they affect the 18 constitutionality of the interaction between the child 19 and the - 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Doesn't that go to the 21 question of the reasonableness of the scope of the 22 seizure? Don't we have Lidster and -- and other 23 jurisprudence that basically addresses this question and 24 says is this type of seizure or stop detention 25 reasonable?
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 And it's hard to swallow that if a police 2 officer asks a child are you being abused and the child 3 says, yes, I need help, it is nearly impossible to think 4 that that seizure is unreasonable. You're -- you're - 5 you're -- it may well be that 2 hours for a protesting 6 child would be, but isn't that all subject to a question 7 of reasonableness as to the scope of the seizure? 8 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, 9 because - 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: She's helping you, I think. 11 MS. KUBITSCHEK: I'm sorry? 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: She's helping you, I think. 13 (Laughter.) 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but that goes to the 15 reasonableness of the seizure. I was asking you about 16 whether there has been a seizure. Step one, has there 17 been a seizure? And you're saying that in a lot of 18 these situations there simply hasn't been a seizure. 19 Now, once there is a seizure, then we can 20 inquire to whether it's unreasonable or not. But -- but 21 those are two distinct questions, and -- and we've been 22 discussing the mere existence of a seizure.

But, 6 you know, that again is perhaps a good reason why this 7 Court should not reach the merits of the Fourth 8 Amendment question, because in this particular case it 9 was conceded that there was a seizure so early in the - 10 in the case that the normal development of facts which, 11 as Justice Scalia, you have pointed out, whether or not 12 there is a seizure is certainly dependent on the 13 individual facts of the encounter between the individual 14 child and the individual police officer. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're - 16 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Those facts were not 17 developed. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's your 19 argument, again, that we shouldn't reach the merits? 20 MS.

KUBITSCHEK: He would still be entitled 14 to qualified immunity, but if this Court were to vacate, 15 this Court would be effectively be telling lower courts 16 that they should not follow the Pearson sequence ever 17 because if they -- if the lower court reaches a 18 constitutional issue and then rules that the defendant 19 has qualified immunity, which Pearson said that they 20 could do, that this Court would then say no, don't - 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not always. Not always. 22 Only when there is no longer a case in controversy. 23 In -- in many cases there will still be a case or 24 controversy. 25 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well -

It -- it isn't true that it will just eliminate 4 the whole purpose of our -- of our jurisprudence in this 5 area. In many cases the -- the decision below can be 6 appealed, and -- and we will rule on the -- on the 7 constitutional question. 8 MS.

KUBITSCHEK: It -- it's a different 13 situation, but if they're in the situations where 14 individual defendants have qualified immunity, it has 15 been the procedure in this Court not only since Pearson 16 but really going all the way back to Siegert v. Gilley, 17 1991, where the Court recommended that the lower courts 18 reach the constitutional issue -- in Siegert this Court 19 said that they can. In County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 20 the Court said that they -- it's the better approach. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could you have 22 cross-petitioned in an effort to get damages, so if you 23 had wanted to preserve the issue, you surely could have 24 done that, couldn't you? 25 MS. KUBITSCHEK: S.G. could have

KUBITSCHEK: The Monell action against 8 the municipality was dismissed on the facts. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't it -- isn't a 10 motion to reinstate it still pending in the district 11 court? 12 MS.

KUBITSCHEK: And, Your Honor, that - 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -

1 MS. KUBITSCHEK: -- that would be to -- to 2 tell the officials who investigate child abuse that in 3 the name of protecting children, they do not have free 4 rein to do anything and everything that they think is 5 appropriate, because what they do harms children, 6 including the very children they claim to be trying to 7 protect. 8 As Justice Breyer said, even raising those 9 questions would -- would be beneficial to children who 10 are forced to undergo child abuse investigations, 75 11 percent of whom have not been abused at all, and who 12 find the experience psychologically traumatic. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you're making an 14 argument on something that you've already told us you 15 have no cognizable interest in -- correct? 16 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Correct. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: If you were designing what 18 you would regard as an ideal system, and you're very 19 knowledgeable in this -- in this area, and you concluded 20 that some kind of approval by a detached individual 21 should be required before something like this is 22 allowed, would you set the standard at probable cause? 23 Would you say that the child protective service has to 24 have probable cause that there's abuse before they can 25 question the child to find whether or not there was

1 abuse, or would you set it at some lower level? 2 MS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, in fact, Your Honor, 3 the -- most of the States have a procedure for seeking 4 court approval, and their -- they differ in whether they 5 require probable cause or reasonable suspicion or 6 something like reasonable cause; and so while we put in 7 our brief that the seizure of S.G. should have been 8 based upon probable cause, given the law enforcement 9 component, if there was -- if Alford, the deputy 10 sheriff, were not there at all, and it was purely a 11 child welfare seizure and the child welfare caseworker 12 were going to a juvenile court judge and seeking some 13 kind of judicial approval, the -- because the laws of 14 the States differ between reasonable suspicion and 15 probable cause, I would suggest that the better course 16 would be to let this play itself out between those two 17 legal standards. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 19 MS.

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, just a point of 2 clarification before you go on. You said earlier that 3 your office had advised the county not to seize 4 children. Does that mean they're not talking to 5 children at all? Is -- you used the word seized. Are 6 you advising them that they don't have the right to talk 7 to children? Without their parental consent or a 8 warrant? 9 MR. KROGER: No, Your Honor, but they would 10 have to talk to children in a way which runs no risk of 11 being found of seizing the children within the meaning 12 of the Ninth Circuit decision. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, so then walking along 14 the hall in the school, right? 15 MR. KROGER: I - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just come up alongside: 17 "By the way, I wanted to ask you whether your mother --" 18 (Laughter.) 19 MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor, and you can 20 see the problem which the Ninth Circuit decision causes 21 practically on the child welfare system in the State of 22 Oregon. The -- Mr. Camreta and other child protective 23 services workers under the Ninth Circuit decision face 24 an enormous burden. In most of these cases it is 25 impossible to establish probable cause to get a warrant

1 without first speaking to the child because the child is 2 usually the only witness that is available to the 3 government; and so to require, as the Ninth Circuit has 4 here, that we obtain a warrant prior to even speaking to 5 a child victim places - 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the standard? I 7 mean, I just assume you're not suggesting that this 8 procedure could be used with every child in every school 9 without some ground for suspicion, correct? 10 MR. KROGER: No, Your Honor, we believe that 11 reasonable suspicion is the -- is the proper basis 12 before making a seizure of a child to conduct one of 13 these inquiries. 14 Significant here in Griffin and subsequent 15 cases like Lidster, the Court has recognized that the 16 relationship between the State and the person being 17 searched or seized is significant to the reasonableness 18 analysis, and here it is not an adversarial 19 relationship. The child and the State share a 20 significant interest in making sure that that child is 21 safe; and were the government to continue to be put in a 22 position of not being able to speak to a child until 23 probable cause has developed in some other way, children 24 will continue to be placed at risk. 25 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, General, I take it that

1 that problem disappears -- tell me if I'm wrong -- if we 2 find there's no jurisdiction. If we Munsingwear this 3 case, the decision is wiped off the case, you return to 4 status quo ante, and you tell all your people that they 5 can do what they would have done beforehand; is that 6 right? 7 MR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor. 8 That would be a -- a significant step forward for Mr. 9 Camreta and others similarly placed. The -- the 10 challenge is that those kind of claims then would be 11 perpetually subject to -- to qualified immunity because 12 the law would not be clarified. And that - 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you -- are you - 14 and I guess what I'm asking is, let's assume we go ex 15 ante. At any moment that an agency speaks to a child, 16 they can move from a nonseizure to a seizure, correct? 17 And some seizures can be reasonable and some can't, 18 right? 19 MR. KROGER: That's correct, Your Honor. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And law enforcement is 21 never going to know where that line of reasonableness or 22 unreasonableness is, is that correct? 23 MR. KROGER: That's correct. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's in -- that's in 25 the nature of doing this without a warrant, isn't it?

1 MR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor. That's part 2 of the reason we agreed that a seizure was committed 3 here, so that law enforcement are not placed in a 4 difficult position every time they speak to a child, of 5 trying to make their own determination as to whether - 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they do it anyway, 7 meaning even if we say that they can seize the child, 8 you would still have to not do a seizure that was 9 unreasonable. You wouldn't -- in scope. They can't 10 speak to the child endlessly, can they? 11 MR. KROGER: No, Your Honor, that's correct. 12 The government officials will have to conduct that - 13 that seizure in a reasonable manner for a reasonable 14 duration. That's different, I think, though, Your 15 Honor, than the threshold question of if they start to 16 talk to a child, of trying to judge in the middle of an 17 interview, have we gone too far, has a seizure occurred. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not quite sure why 19 you stipulated to a seizure in this case, but that was 20 your strategic choice. 21 MR. KROGER: Mr. Chief Justice, the question 22 is whether vacating the decision will have an impact on 23 the litigation below, and it will. The Respondent is 24 seeking to preserve the Ninth Circuit decision precisely 25 to aid the Fourth Amendment claim that the Respondent is
