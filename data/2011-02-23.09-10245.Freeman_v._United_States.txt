1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:14 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 09-10245, Freeman v. United 5 States. 6 Mr. Heft. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. HEFT, JR., 8 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 9 MR. HEFT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 William Freeman's plea agreement, his 12 presentence report, and the sentencing record all show 13 that his term of imprisonment was based on a crack 14 cocaine guideline that was retroactively lowered by the 15 United States Sentencing Commission. This case asked 16 the Court to decide whether the fact that a sentencing 17 court accepted a plea agreement under Criminal Rule 18 11(c)(1)(C) precludes eligibility for a sentence 19 reduction under section 3582(c)(2). We submit that 20 Mr. Freeman is not barred from eligibility for a (c)(2) 21 sentence reduction for several reasons. 22 First, under the ordinary definition of 23 "based upon" and in the context of this particular 24 statute, since the subsequently lowered guideline was 25 used to determine Mr. Freeman's term of imprisonment,

1 that term of imprisonment was based on the subsequently 2 lowered guideline. 3 Second, the categorical ban on eligibility 4 adopted by the Sixth Circuit and advanced by the 5 Government frustrates the purpose underlying section 6 (c)(2) and finds no support in the plain language of the 7 statute, of the rule, and under the terms of 8 Mr. Freeman's plea agreement. 9 Third, a record-based analysis that reviews 10 the plea agreement, the presentence report, and the 11 sentencing record to determine the basis of the sentence 12 is -- is best suited to correctly implement section 13 (c)(2), and it's -- that record-based analysis supports 14 the conclusion that Mr. Freeman's sentence was indeed 15 based on a retroactively lowered guideline. The -- the 16 Sixth Circuit - 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if we issue an 18 opinion and we analyze the statute's language, the 19 statute's purpose, and the statute's legislative 20 history, would the opinion, the judgment be based on 21 each of those or -- or not? In other words, does 22 everything that goes into the final determination, would 23 you say that determination is based on each of those 24 factors individually? 25 MR. HEFT: Yes. Certainly, it is based -

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the determination certainly would be based on the 2 statute, Your Honor, but, as we've -- we've argued in 3 our brief, we've asked the Court to take what we believe 4 to be a record-based analysis and look at -- look at the 5 record in this case, look at the terms of the plea 6 agreement, look at the - 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. My - 8 MR. HEFT: I'm sorry. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think my question 10 goes in a different direction. This plea agreement, I 11 think, could be said to be based on the sentencing 12 guidelines, but it is also based on the agreement. In 13 other words, the combination of the two of them is what 14 gives you the -- the sentence. So how can you say it's 15 based on only the sentencing guidelines when it may not 16 have been imposed in the absence of the plea agreement? 17 Probably wouldn't have been. 18 MR. HEFT: Mr. Chief Justice, we don't 19 believe that that's mutually exclusive. A sentence can 20 be a guideline -- a sentence based on the guidelines, 21 and it can be a sentence based on a C plea agreement. 22 JUSTICE ALITO: You quote one definition 23 of -- the noun "base" in your brief uses a point from 24 which something can develop, but you omit another 25 standard definition of the term, the principal element
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 or -- or ingredient of anything, considered as its 2 fundamental part. Why do you do that? 3 MR. HEFT: Well, Your Honor, I -- I think 4 the dictionary definition that we've given encompasses 5 the definition that Your Honor has just -- just 6 described. The -- and our position - 7 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there's two -- there 8 are two different definitions. One is something that 9 provides a starting point for analysis. The other is 10 the fundamental thing on which something is -- it rests. 11 MR. HEFT: Well -- well, our contention 12 is - 13 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, if you use the latter 14 definition, you have to decide which is more fundamental 15 here, the agreement between the parties or the 16 sentencing guidelines, which certainly provided the 17 starting point for the analysis of the sentence by 18 the -- by the district court. 19 MR. HEFT: Justice Alito, that's correct. 20 The guidelines certainly were the starting point, but 21 they were also the principal foundation of this 22 agreement because what the agreement is - 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it enough for you 24 to say -- or based not in whole, but in part -- based 25 on, something could be based on several things, and one
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of them is the guidelines that then existed? 2 MR. HEFT: Certainly. Certainly. And this 3 -- this plea agreement reflects that it was based on the 4 guidelines. If you - 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then are you 6 saying the plea agreement was based on the fact that he 7 was caught with -- with two guns rather than four guns? 8 Would you be willing to say that? In other words, 9 everything -- your position, it seems to me, could be 10 criticized for saying everything that contributes to the 11 final 106 months, that that sentence is based on every 12 one of those things - 13 MR. HEFT: Well - 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- which makes the 15 -- which makes the statutory language largely mute on 16 this. 17 MR. HEFT: Well, Your Honor, the -- the 18 sentence is based on a number of guidelines. Each -- no 19 sentence is based on just one guideline, as this plea 20 agreement reflects. It's based on a compilation of 21 guidelines. It's -- it's based on the crack guideline, 22 and as prior - 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's also 24 based on things that are not reflected in the 25 guidelines. You've got a particular U.S. attorney who
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 is more lenient in prosecuting these types of crimes 2 than another one. The fact that you got the minimum 3 under the guidelines might be based on that. It's based 4 on the fact that this person felt he could handle 106 5 months in prison, and he wasn't willing to risk whatever 6 the top -- what was the top sentence under the guideline 7 calculation? 8 MR. HEFT: It would have been 117 months. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he figures it's 10 better for me to get -- it's based on his decision that 11 I -- 106 months is better than the risk of 117. 12 MR. HEFT: Well, certainly there are a 13 number of factors that go into plea bargaining and 14 negotiation, but what -- I think what the court has to 15 look at is what is said in that plea agreement. And I 16 think, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out a minute ago, the 17 definition of "based on" -- if a guideline sentence 18 is -- if a sentence is based in part on the guidelines, 19 that would be adequate under the -- under section - 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What sentence would 21 he have gotten if he were just sentenced under the 22 guidelines, no plea agreement? 23 MR. HEFT: He would have got the -- he would 24 have received the same sentence, Your Honor. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- well, how do
8

1 we know that? 2 MR. HEFT: Well - 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The guidelines give 4 you a range. The judge might have given him 117 months. 5 MR. HEFT: But -- but the plea agreement 6 here was for the bottom of the guidelines. The parties 7 calculated - 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know. I'm 9 putting aside the plea agreement. What would he have 10 gotten under the sentencing guidelines? We --we don't 11 know, right? 12 MR. HEFT: It would have been left - 13 left -- well, assume it depends upon the nature of the 14 plea, Your Honor. You're talking - 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no plea. He 16 is convicted at trial. 17 MR. HEFT: It would be somewhere within that 18 guideline range. That's correct. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how can you say 20 that this is based on the guideline range when the 21 guideline range would not have been determinative? 22 MR. HEFT: Well -- well, we're looking - 23 we're looking at the content of the plea agreement, Your 24 Honor. The -- the plea agreement says - 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I know, but my
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 hypothetical is in a different context. 2 MR. HEFT: But even -- even at that, Your 3 Honor, if -- that sentence ultimately is going to be 4 based on a guideline range, and if that guideline range 5 is subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, 6 then the - 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could you - 8 maybe it would be easier if you would describe to us the 9 situations you don't think would be based on the 10 guidelines. 11 The Solicitor General claims that since 12 every plea negotiation has to start with the guideline 13 calculation as a starting point for departure and/or 14 consideration by the judge under 6B1, that every C plea 15 agreement would be considered based on. Are you taking 16 that position? 17 MR. HEFT: No, Your Honor. Absolutely not. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So I'll give 19 you a couple of examples, but you give me more. Would a 20 plea agreement that doesn't mention the guidelines at 21 all but picks a sentence within the actual guideline - 22 is that based on the guideline? 23 MR. HEFT: Possibly, Your Honor. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And how 25 about one that departs or varies from the guideline, the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 range, whichever word you want to use? 2 MR. HEFT: Your Honor, the -- the Sentencing 3 Commission, in 1B1.10 note 3, says that a 4 below-guideline sentence can be based on the guidelines. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there -- the 6 Solicitor General is right; there really isn't any 7 situation that you're claiming is not based on? 8 MR. HEFT: Oh -- oh, no, Your Honor. There 9 are -- there are C pleas. 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Give me the examples. 11 MR. HEFT: All right. Well, first of all, 12 we've cited cases in our brief where circuit courts have 13 determined that a C plea was not based on the 14 guidelines. But let me give you another example. 15 Let's just assume the guideline range is 16 something like 151 to 188 months, and then -- but the 17 parties agree to a sentence of 60 months, and they do 18 that for several reasons. First of all, maybe the 19 defendant is elderly. Maybe the defendant has serious 20 medical conditions. Maybe the defendant has -- was 21 sexually abused as a child. If those are the factors, 22 if that's the reason why the defendant got that - 23 received that 60-month sentence, that sentence is not 24 based on the guideline range. 25 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, wouldn't the
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 guidelines, even in that situation, provide the starting 2 point for analysis? Isn't the district court obligated, 3 and isn't the -- doesn't the presentence report have to 4 go through the guidelines calculation before the 5 sentence is imposed? So you start out with the -- the 6 guideline sentence of whatever the figure was that you 7 mentioned, and then you go from there, and maybe you 8 depart downward. 9 MR. HEFT: That -- that's true. The -- the 10 guidelines would be the starting point of any 11 negotiation, but - 12 JUSTICE ALITO: So why wouldn't that be 13 based on the guidelines? Just because there's such a 14 big downward departure? 15 MR. HEFT: It -- Your Honor, it would not be 16 based on the guidelines if those other factors were the 17 motivating reason for the imposition of the sentence. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Sorry, I don't understand 19 that. Don't the guidelines provide for departures? 20 MR. HEFT: They do, Your Honor. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- and aren't you 22 giving a guideline sentence, if you give your reasons as 23 is required by the Sentencing Commission in 6B1.2 and 24 you say -- the judge says, I think this is a special 25 case and, therefore, I am giving a lower sentence? Just
12

1 as he's required to do under the guidelines in order to 2 accept a C type agreement. 3 MR. HEFT: If the parties can show that the 4 sentence is tied to the guidelines. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how could it not be? 6 Wouldn't the judge have to say it's not tied to the 7 guidelines, because I am varying and I no longer wish to 8 apply the guideline? If he doesn't say that, isn't he 9 applying the guideline? 10 MR. HEFT: In that instance, he would be - 11 he would be applying it. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Whether he gives the 13 specific robbery 3-point whatever it is, 17 months, or 14 whether he says, I have a special case and I depart 15 under section 5 of the guidelines. Both of those are 16 guideline sentences, aren't they? 17 MR. HEFT: If the -- if the judge were to 18 take -- were to actually apply those guidelines and say, 19 based on that guideline, I am going to depart, that 20 sentence is based on the guidelines. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So from what base does a 22 judge depart downward? From the crack cocaine range or 23 from the downward departure range? 24 MR. HEFT: I think it would depend on the 25 nature of the agreement, Your Honor. It may very well
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 depend on -- the judge may depart from the crack 2 cocaine. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So aren't you just 4 asking us to permit district court judges to make up 5 their own C agreement, to decide what the parties would 6 have done in the absence of a higher range? And don't 7 we fall prey to sort of just asking district court 8 judges to create their own agreements? 9 MR. HEFT: No -- no, Your Honor. I don't 10 believe that's -- that's not what we are asking the 11 Court to do at all. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Heft, are you relying 13 on -- this was -- this is a plea agreement that said, 14 specifically, defendant agrees to have his sentence 15 determined pursuant to the guidelines, and then the 16 judge says that he was adopting the probation report and 17 the application of the guidelines as set out therein, so 18 both the -- the defendant says, I agreed to a 19 determination pursuant to the guidelines, and the judge 20 says, I'm going to apply the guidelines in giving you 21 your sentence. 22 So the hypotheticals we're talking about are 23 quite far afield from where you have a specific 24 statement by the defendant and the sentencing judge that 25 the guidelines are being applied.
14

1 MR. HEFT: That is correct, Your Honor, and 2 that's why we've asked the Court not to take a 3 categorical approach to this issue, but to take either a 4 case-by-case approach or a record-based analysis, to 5 allow the district judge to determine, as Justice 6 Ginsburg pointed out, what our -- you know, what is the 7 -8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Heft, would you require 9 those kinds of statements in the agreement or in the 10 colloquy in order to satisfy the standard? Suppose 11 those statements just didn't exist. 12 MR. HEFT: That's certainly problematic, 13 Justice Kagan. If those -- if there was nothing in that 14 plea agreement to tie the sentence to the -- the 15 sentence -- the agreed sentence to the guidelines, that 16 certainly would be problematic. 17 But that doesn't resolve the issue one way 18 or the other, because the judge would have to consider 19 the presentence report to see if there's a connection or 20 correlation between the agreed sentence and the 21 guidelines, and also the judge could look at the guilty 22 plea colloquy and sentencing transcript to see if the 23 attorneys actually expressed their intent about where 24 this sentence came from. 25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Heft, that seems very
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 complicated. You have to look at everything and you're 2 not giving us a lot of guidance as to what you do when 3 you -- when you see these things. I mean, this sort of 4 case-by-case, all-things-considered approach just seems 5 as though you're going to get a lot of inconsistent 6 decisions. 7 MR. HEFT: Respectfully, Your Honor, I 8 disagree. I think this is what district judges do all 9 the time, not just in the context of a C plea, but a B 10 plea as well. They have to look at the nature of the 11 plea agreement. They have to look at the PSR. They 12 have to look at the sentencing transcript to -- to 13 determine whether or not the defendant is -- is eligible 14 for that sentence reduction. 15 So judges are doing this routinely. They're 16 doing this - 17 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in every case, they 18 have to go through the guidelines calculation, and the 19 parties have the opportunity to object to the 20 calculation, right? 21 MR. HEFT: Yes, Your Honor. 22 JUSTICE ALITO: So what does paragraph 12 of 23 the plea agreement contribute here, other than with 24 respect to the fine and things besides the sentence that 25 we're talking about? It doesn't seem to me to add
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 anything substantively. 2 MR. HEFT: I -- well, Your Honor, I think it 3 does, Justice Alito. I think it does add -- it adds 4 substance, and it adds meaning to that plea agreement 5 because in paragraph 11 where the parties very 6 meticulously go through the offense level, tie that to 7 the guidelines, and then -- then they state in paragraph 8 12, the -- the defendant agrees to be sentenced pursuant 9 to the -- to the guidelines. That's very clear that the 10 review in the guideline calculation is what the sentence 11 is based on. And - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can a -- can a sentencing 13 judge be found to have abused his or her discretion in 14 approving a plea -- a C plea agreement which provides 15 for less than the minimum guideline sentence and gives 16 no -- no particular reason for that? Would that be 17 appealed as an invalid sentence? 18 MR. HEFT: Well, Your Honor, under -- under 19 section 3742, the government could -- could appeal an 20 incorrect application of the guidelines if that's what 21 Your Honor is referring to. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well - 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But now you're talking 24 about a plea agreement, which the government has 25 consented to whatever this agreement is and whether -
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 whether -- sometimes a plea agreement will say okay, if 2 you take a plea, we'll drop certain charges or we'll 3 charge a small amount -- value of the drug. Was there 4 any of that in -- in this plea? 5 MR. HEFT: No, Your Honor. Mr. Freeman 6 pleaded guilty to all charges in the indictment. The 7 parties stipulated the amount of -- of drugs that were 8 found on his person when he was arrested. So there were 9 no dismissed charges, no amended charges in this plea 10 agreement. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let -- let me ask my 12 question a different way. In deciding whether to 13 approve the plea agreement, doesn't the judge have to 14 consider whether it is an application of the guidelines, 15 whether it is wildly inconsistent with the guidelines, 16 whether it does not take into account valid reasons for 17 departure from the guidelines? 18 MR. HEFT: Yes. The judge would have to 19 consider the guidelines. Right. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Then, if that's the case, 21 then every plea agreement is based on the guidelines, 22 every single one, because the judge always has to 23 consider how do the guidelines apply to this plea 24 agreement. 25 MR. HEFT: Well, Justice Scalia,
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 consideration of the guidelines alone is not enough to 2 determine whether or not that sentence is actually based 3 on them. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand why you 5 resist that. I mean, that's precisely what the 6 guidelines say. The only ones that aren't guideline 7 sentences are -- are dismissal charges, where it's an 8 agreement to dismiss. But a type B, type C -- the 9 guidelines themselves say that the judge, here's what 10 you do. Judge, you look and see if the guidelines 11 sentence is there. Is it a guideline sentence? If it 12 is, you can approve it. If it isn't, you can't. 13 I mean, that's my reading of what it says. 14 So -- so why do you resist that conclusion? 15 MR. HEFT: Well, Your Honor - 16 JUSTICE BREYER: And, of course, the judge 17 now could depart from the guidelines -- I mean, "vary," 18 whatever that word -- technical word, is -- "vary." He 19 can say, I'm not going to apply the guidelines at all. 20 But if he is going to apply the guidelines, isn't that 21 what they tell him to do? I've always thought that. 22 You may tell me I'm mistaken. 23 MR. HEFT: They -- they do; obviously they 24 do consider the guidelines, but then the other question 25 is whether or not the sentence is based on those
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 guidelines - 2 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how could it not be, 3 since the judge has no power if he is to apply the 4 guideline - 5 MR. HEFT: Well - 6 JUSTICE BREYER: -- to accept any agreement 7 other than agreement that corresponds with the 8 guideline? That's what it says. It says the court 9 should accept a recommended sentence or a C -- the 10 specific sentence -- only if the court is satisfied 11 either that it is within the applicable guideline range 12 or if it's based on a departure under the guidelines. 13 That seems to me what it says. Isn't that what it says? 14 MR. HEFT: That is what it says, Your Honor, 15 but - 16 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then if that's so, 17 every sentence is -- you're going to say no? 18 MR. HEFT: No. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I thought that was 20 helping you, but if you want to say no, go say no and 21 explain why that is. 22 (Laughter.) 23 MR. HEFT: Your Honor, to go back to the 24 point that Justice Sotomayor made - 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
20

1 MR. HEFT: -- with the hypotheticals, there 2 still can be C pleas that are not based on the 3 guidelines. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: How? 5 MR. HEFT: Well, the example - 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Give me an example. 7 MR. HEFT: Well, the example that I gave -8 I gave previously. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: What? 10 MR. HEFT: There's a guideline range. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 12 MR. HEFT: But the judge bases his decision, 13 his or her decision, solely on other -- factors other 14 than the guidelines. As I mentioned earlier - 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Are we supposed to 16 psychoanalyze the judge? The judge says on his writing, 17 checks the box: This is a guideline sentence. It is 18 robbery. It is precisely within the robbery range. But 19 I -- I am going to give it the low end of the range 20 because I believe that the -- he has a lovely mother and 21 family and so forth. 22 Okay? You're saying that isn't based on the 23 guideline. No? Okay. Is that the point? 24 MR. HEFT: Well, it depends what the judge 25 does at sentencing, Your Honor.

1 JUSTICE BREYER: What he does is he applies 2 the guideline sentence. He has to do that. Now, within 3 that range, he has applied the guideline sentence, he 4 got the information. He says, I am satisfied it 5 applies -- done. 6 Now are we supposed to look further and say 7 what his true reason is? Is that what you're saying? 8 MR. HEFT: It would -- Your Honor, I would 9 submit it would depend on the nature of the -- the plea 10 agreement, whether or not that sentence is -- is 11 actually based -- going to be based on the guidelines. 12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I suppose - 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Incidentally, and it sort 14 of bears upon this discussion, are the guidelines 15 mandatory when they are applied in approving a plea 16 agreement? In other words, does Booker/Fanfan not apply 17 to the application of the guidelines when a judge is - 18 is approving a plea agreement? Do you think the 19 guidelines are mandatory in that situation? 20 MR. HEFT: No, Your Honor. They're - 21 JUSTICE BREYER: You were -- you were just 22 at the very point when we decided Booker, is that right? 23 It was -- your -- your sentencing took place in July 24 2005 and we came out with Booker in - 25 MR. HEFT: I believe it was March of 2005.

1 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So it's quite 2 possible the judge wasn't totally -- but I mean -- I 3 agree; it's much more complicated after Booker. I don't 4 know how to treat yours. 5 MR. HEFT: That's true. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: It's on the cusp. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: What if there had been 8 evidence here of that? What if the government in 9 connection with this plea agreement had dropped counts 10 or had decided not to seek a superseding indictment 11 adding counts? Would -- would the situation be the 12 same? 13 MR. HEFT: Yes. Your Honor, I think it 14 would; it would be the same. Because the court would 15 have to look at, again, what the terms of the plea - 16 plea agreement was and what the parties determined. 17 Now, the -- I think what I should emphasize is that 18 we're only talking about eligibility here; and if -- if 19 those -- if those concessions that the government has 20 made would -- would perhaps result or at least in the 21 government's view, result in an unjustified windfall, 22 that -- that's -- that is not a critical factor in 23 determining eligibility. That's not factor at all in 24 determining eligibility. 25 That could come into play after eligibility
23

1 is determined and the judge -- district judge determines 2 whether or how much. 3 JUSTICE ALITO: How would that possibly 4 work? Let's say the government drops count -- agrees to 5 a plea on count 1 with a guideline range of 60 to 65 6 months; drops count 2, which would have increased the 7 guideline range to, let's say, 100 to 105 months; and 8 says this is our deal, you know, you agree to -- to 65 9 months and we're going to drop count 2. All right? 10 MR. HEFT: Yes. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: And then the guideline for 12 that is lowered, and you say in determining whether the 13 defendant is eligible, what -- the government would then 14 have to have a mini-trial and prove that the -- prove 15 count 2? 16 MR.

1 reduced, and then, as the judge said in this case said, 2 if you have objections, let me know; file your 3 objections. That's where the government could file - 4 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. The government files 5 its objections and says, well, we dropped count 2. And 6 the defendant says, well, I wasn't guilty of count 2. 7 MR. HEFT: That's -- that's up to the 8 district judge's discretion, whether or not to -- to 9 reduce that -- that amended guideline sentence. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: How is the judge going to 11 decide that? 12 MR. HEFT: Well, the -- I think that's 13 something that district judges decide every day, whether 14 or not -- because the judge presumably has -- has 15 been -- is familiar with the case, with the presentence 16 report, with the terms of the original plea agreement, 17 with the facts of the case; and the -- and the judge can 18 make an assessment based on those factors whether or not 19 the sentence reduction should be granted and, if so, how 20 much of a reduction should be granted. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: But Justice Alito's 22 hypothetical points out -- points up the fact that even 23 though the agreement may mention the guidelines, it may 24 do that just for the purpose of enabling the -- the 25 judge more readily to approve the agreement, but there's
25

1 no reason to believe that the government is interested 2 in the guidelines, as opposed to being interested in 3 putting this person away for a certain amount of time, 4 especially when another count is dropped and the 5 government says, well, I'll -- you know, I'll drop it 6 if -- if this guy goes to prison for 2 years. But if 7 the government had known he's not going for 2 years, he 8 is only going for a year and a half or a year, the 9 agreement might not have been concluded. So it 10 really -- I mean, it doesn't further the intent of both 11 parties, at least, to say when the guideline is changed, 12 the agreement changes. 13 MR. HEFT: Well -- well, the agreement 14 certainly has been -- was modified by the amended 15 guideline, and that's where the district judge has to 16 exercise his or her discretion whether or not to grant 17 that reduction. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in that event, the 19 sweet part would be open to reconsideration too. I 20 mean, you can't say, I want the good part, the lowered 21 guideline, but I also want to keep that certain counts 22 are dropped and that a certain quantity of drugs was 23 agreed upon. You would have to reopen the whole thing. 24 MR. HEFT: No, Your -- no, Justice Ginsburg. 25 I don't think you'd have to reopen the case. Again, I

1 think the judge could look at the presentence report, 2 the government could make its objections saying here's 3 why we gave that particular sentence, and the judge 4 could exercise his or her discretion to say whether or 5 not the defendant is going to get that sentence 6 reduction. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 8 MR. HEFT: Thank you, Your Honor. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Gannon. 10 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON 11 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 12 MR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 13 please the Court: 14 When a criminal defendant and the government 15 agree to a specific sentence and that agreement is 16 binding on the sentencing judge by virtue of Rule 17 11(c)(1)(C), the resulting sentence is based on the 18 parties' agreement. It is not based on the advisory 19 guideline range that would otherwise have been used at 20 sentencing, even if the sentence corresponds to that 21 range. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel - 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, here the agreement 24 at various points says that the parties agree on the 25 calculation of the guideline. I think it's paragraph 11
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and 12. They say that the sentence is according to the 2 guidelines. So there's reference to the guidelines 3 throughout, and the court made the guidelines 4 calculation. 5 MR. GANNON: The court certainly made the - 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seems to me fair 7 under the statute to say that it is based on the 8 guidelines. 9 MR. GANNON: Well, the question - 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And there are other 11 provisions in the agreement you might argue about. 12 MR. GANNON: Well, I think the statutory 13 question here isn't just whether the sentence is based 14 on the guidelines. The language under 3582(c)(2) is 15 whether the defendant was sentenced to a term of 16 imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has 17 subsequently been lowered by the Commission. So it's 18 not just whether the guidelines played a role; it's 19 whether this particular sentencing range was what was 20 driving the sentence. 21 And, Justice Kennedy, you point out pages 22 25, 26 of the plea agreement in the Joint Appendix. And 23 I think it's instructive that the agreement deals 24 differently with the fine component, as Justice Alito 25 referred to earlier, than it does with the term of
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 imprisonment. At the bottom of page 25, the agreement 2 says that a fine will be at the lowest end of the 3 applicable guideline range. And then if you go over to 4 pages 27 and 28 in paragraph 11, that's where the 5 guideline calculation occurs. And notice it is an 6 incomplete calculation. The parties don't actually come 7 up with a final calculation because they don't come up 8 with a criminal history. They don't - 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, they do come up with 10 a recommendation, which is three levels below the 11 otherwise applicable guideline. 12 MR. GANNON: They -- they come up with a 13 recommendation for purposes of determining the offense 14 level, the base offense level of 22 and then reduced to 15 19. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but that's all based 17 on the guidelines. 18 MR. GANNON: Well, that aspect is based on 19 the guidelines, but then the guideline application 20 computation is incomplete because the next paragraph, 21 paragraph B, says we aren't agreed on what the criminal 22 history is going to be. And to the next paragraph, 23 paragraph C specifically says that the foregoing 24 statements of applicability of sections of the 25 sentencing guidelines are not binding upon the court.

1 The defendant understands the court will independently 2 calculate the guidelines at sentencing; that is - 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that doesn't mean that 4 the court can't base its conclusion on his 5 independent -- on its independent judgment on the 6 guideline. 7 MR. GANNON: Well, I think what I'm trying 8 to say, Justice Kennedy, is the agreement expressly 9 contemplates that the judge needs to determine the 10 applicable guideline range for purposes of determining 11 what the fine will be. And that's different from the 12 way the plea agreement deals with the term of 13 imprisonment because if we go back to page 26, it does 14 not tie the -- the term of imprisonment to a guideline 15 range. That's completely different from the way it 16 deals with a fine. It specifically says there's an 17 agreement that the sentence of 106 months of 18 incarceration is the appropriate amount. And so that 19 happens to have been at the bottom end of the guideline 20 range that would have been applicable if the parties' 21 agreement -- if the parties' prediction about the likely 22 criminal history calculation turned out to be the right 23 one. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're talking about 25 what "based on" means, and that's an important part of

1 your argument. If I could just, while I've got you, 2 jump to this question of what happens on remand if you 3 lose the case. On remand, I take it, you're not bound 4 by the agreement because of the last - 5 MR. GANNON: Well, I - 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the last of section 24 7 says the defendant argues for any sentence other than 8 the one to which he has agreed to and breached the 9 agreement. 10 MR. GANNON: Well, at that point the remedy 11 for the breach would be that the United States is 12 relieved of its obligations under the agreement. 13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you -- what would 14 that mean? 15 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that's -- that's 16 part of the problem in a case like this where there was 17 a specific sentence agreement, that it's impossible for 18 government to get back the things that it gave up at the 19 time, that were agreed to under - 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's got guilty 21 pleas on all of the counts. We know that. 22 MR. GANNON: Well, but it also - 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In your position, in your 24 view, would the government be able to take the position 25 that the guilty pleas stay in place, but it now wants

GANNON: I don't think that the 6 3582(c)(2) contemplates that the sentence will be 7 increased. The only thing, as the court - 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, except that the 9 agreement does. The agreement relieves you. 10 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that's if - 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of any obligation. I see 12 what you mean. 13 MR. GANNON: Now that the sentence has 14 become final, I think 3582(c)(2) has opened a narrow 15 window for ways in which the otherwise final sentence 16 could be modified. It only contemplates that the judge 17 will have the discretion to reduce the sentence if it 18 is, first, a sentence that was based on the relevant 19 guideline range that's subsequently been amended and 20 made retroactively applicable. But also, second, then 21 the judge would need to comply with a policy statement 22 that appears in 1B1.10 of the - 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you say the judgment's 24 final, so the fact that the plea -- that there's a 25 breach of the plea agreement is irrelevant at this
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 point? 2 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that the remedy 3 that the agreement contemplates of the government being 4 released from its other obligations in the plea doesn't 5 really leave us much of an option at this point. We're 6 not going to be able to go back and argue that he should 7 have been sentenced at the upper end of the range that 8 we're talking about. We're not going to be arguing that 9 the criminal history should have been a higher or that 10 the criminal history substantially underrepresented the 11 seriousness of his history where he had 10 years of 12 offenses preceding this one. There may have even been a 13 potential career adjustment that -- that went by the 14 boards. That's mentioned on page 162 of the Joint 15 Appendix. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Gannon, you assert that 17 the -- within the language of the statutory provision, 18 the sentence here is not based on the guidelines, but 19 it's based on the agreement, and the agreement arguably 20 is based on the guidelines. 21 MR. GANNON: I think the agreement is 22 arguably -- I mean, I don't think the face of this 23 agreement proves that it's based on the guidelines, but 24 I -- it is obvious that the parties negotiated in the 25 shadow of the guidelines.
33

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if you take that 2 position, that "based on" means determined by 3 absolutely, then I don't think any sentence would ever 4 be based on the guidelines after Booker/Fanfan. 5 MR. GANNON: Well - 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: The guidelines form part of 7 the consideration of the judge, but the judge's decision 8 is not based on the guidelines. Just as here, the - 9 the agreement -- the guidelines form part of what 10 produces the agreement, so also they form part of what 11 produces the judge's decision. And it seems to me, if 12 that's going to be enough for the judge's determination, 13 it ought to be the same for the agreement. 14 MR. GANNON: Well, I think it's not clear 15 that the judge needed to be considering the guidelines 16 in the course of deciding whether to accept the plea 17 agreement. And Justice Breyer earlier had a colloquy 18 with Mr. Heft about guideline 6B1.2, which, even before 19 Booker, was a nonbinding policy statement. And so, to 20 be sure, when 3582 was enacted, the guidelines were 21 binding, and, therefore, it -- they would have been 22 expected to have played a larger role in most sentences. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but let's -- let's 24 assume there is no plea agreement. 25 MR. GANNON: Yes. And -

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you have a judge who 2 sentences post-Booker/Fanfan. Now, his sentence is not 3 based on the guidelines any more - 4 MR. GANNON: I think - 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- any more than this 6 agreement is based on the guidelines. The guidelines 7 are one of the things that he must take into account and 8 does take into account in determining the sentence. 9 Now, if that is enough for purposes of 10 determining whether this statute -- statutory provision 11 applies to a sentence imposed directly by a judge, it 12 seems to me the same analysis ought to apply to a 13 sentence imposed through a plea agreement. 14 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that there's a 15 different purpose that's being served by asking the 16 3582(c)(2) inquiry, which is asking the judge to -- to 17 go back and redo the aspects of his analysis that would 18 have been different had the -- the relevant guideline 19 range been changed at the time he engaged in his 20 analysis, and - 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you -- you acknowledge 22 that "based on" covers post-Booker/Fanfan sentences by 23 the judge? 24 MR.

GANNON: It is -- the test that we state 11 in the subheading of that section of our brief is 12 whether they're of legal consequence in the 13 determination. 14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Defining "legal consequence" 15 is your test, Mr. Gannon - 16 MR. GANNON: Well, our -- the. 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: It's not a binding legal 18 consequence post-Booker. 19 MR. GANNON: The test that we have for - 20 the overarching test is whether it is of legal 21 consequence, and the phrase that you're talking about on 22 page 27 of our brief, Justice Kagan, is when we know 23 that there is something that was of binding legal 24 consequence and was controlling, we know that that is 25 the thing that the sentence was based on.

1 JUSTICE KAGAN: So that's not your test. 2 What is your test instead? 3 MR. GANNON: Well, that is -- in -- when 4 something literally is controlling the analysis -- the 5 parties' agreement here binds the district judge -- we 6 know that that is what the sentence is based on. There 7 isn't any -- any - 8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but is -- is there some 9 other instances in which you would say that something is 10 based on, even though it's not of binding legal 11 consequence? 12 MR. GANNON: Well, it would be of legal 13 consequence even if it weren't controlling. This Court 14 has -- has made clear even after Booker that under 15 3553(a), courts still need to go through the relevant 16 guidelines analysis. They apply the guidelines. It may 17 turn out that the sentence turns out not to be based on 18 the relevant guideline range because the judge - 19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, then I'm back with 20 Justice Scalia, because if it's only of legal 21 consequence, not of binding legal consequence, if it's 22 something that somebody considers rather than something 23 that is determinative, it seems to me the same in the 24 non-plea context and in the plea context. 25 MR. GANNON: Well, I don't think that's true
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 in the context of a specific sentence agreement under a 2 type C plea because of -- and this is reinforced by the 3 language in the policy statement, 1B1.10, which the 4 Court last term in Dillon held is binding and controls 5 what needs to be done during the sentence reduction 6 proceeding. And it specifically refers to the guideline 7 provisions that were applied when the defendant was 8 sentenced. And that's something that happens in the 9 process of the 3553(a) factors applicability. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: Why doesn't this line of 11 questioning lead logically to the conclusion that no 12 sentence after Booker and Fanfan is based on the 13 guidelines? Because, today, a sentencing judge can 14 engage in the same analysis that the Sentencing 15 Commission may engage in when it decides that a 16 guideline range should be lowered and that that should 17 be retroactive. The judge can do that at the time when 18 the sentence is imposed. 19 We roll the clock back on the crack -- on 20 the crack cocaine guidelines. Under the authority that 21 judges now have under Booker and Fanfan, a judge could 22 say, well, I see that this is the crack cocaine 23 guideline right now, but I think it is too harsh for all 24 the reasons that were later persuasive in lowering the 25 range, and therefore, I am sentencing below the range.
38

1 So it seems to lead logically to the 2 conclusion that 3582 is yet another provision of the 3 Sentencing Reform Act that was tied to the old 4 pre-Booker mandatory sentencing regime, and now that 5 that is out the window with Booker and Fanfan, the 6 whole -- the whole mechanism is -- is superfluous. 7 MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I understand the 8 point that the analysis has certainly changed since 9 Booker, but it is still the case that the defendant can 10 appeal an error in application of the guidelines after 11 Booker. 12 If the judge were to -- to misapply the 13 guidelines before he engages in the analysis that you're 14 talking about, Justice Alito, that would be grounds for 15 an appeal. In retrospect, if the judge is asked whether 16 the sentence was based on the guidelines, he -- he may 17 say that particular sentence wasn't, because I ended up 18 disregarding the guidelines under 3553(a). I did the 19 analysis. I was exercising my sentencing discretion the 20 first time around under 3553(a), and the guidelines 21 ended up not being the basis of the sentence. 22 And that is not something that is an option 23 in a type C plea agreement, because there, the defendant 24 cannot appeal when the judge agrees to the sentences in 25 the agreement.
39

1 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I find it hard to -- I 2 find it hard to understand the analysis that would 3 require courts to decide whether some (c)(1)(C) plea 4 agreements are based on the guidelines and some are not 5 based on the guidelines. Maybe they are all based on 6 the guidelines, and then the obligation would be on the 7 government to put a provision in a standard plea 8 agreement requiring the defendant to give up the 9 opportunity to move for a sentence reduction if the 10 guideline range is subsequently lowered. 11 Or maybe none of them are based on the 12 guidelines because -- for the reasons I just mentioned: 13 This whole mechanism is now needed no longer as a result 14 of Booker and Fanfan. 15 MR. GANNON: Well, I think in the context of 16 an actual specific sentence plea agreement, that is the 17 one that we think is off the table, because that is what 18 is going to control the sentence. And some type C plea 19 agreements affirmatively contemplate application of the 20 guidelines, as this one does with respect to the fine. 21 And so when you have a plea agreement that 22 tells the district judge, you are bound to apply a 23 guideline provision once you've accepted this agreement, 24 we haven't taken the position that the resulting 25 sentence there is not based on the relevant guideline

1 range, but that is not what is going on here. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. You want us to 3 decide this case. I completely agree with what Justice 4 Alito is saying, Justice Scalia, that maybe the world 5 after Booker is different. And I have not thought that 6 one through. 7 I am thinking this case is a pre-Booker 8 case. It is not real. I am thinking it is on the cusp, 9 so how am I to treat this case? If it is a case where 10 the guidelines apply, if it is such a case -- and I 11 think maybe everyone here has assumed throughout that it 12 was. Am I right about that? Were you saying this is a 13 case where the guidelines do not apply, where they are 14 not binding? I mean, where pre-Booker doesn't count? 15 MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I - 16 JUSTICE BREYER: How do you want us to take 17 this, pre-Booker or post-Booker? 18 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that the answer 19 is, it's different. But this is a -- this is a 20 post-Booker case. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: I know, you think the -- I 22 think it is completely different regardless. So let's 23 avoid that controversy at the moment, and you tell me 24 whether you want me to take it pre-Booker or 25 post-Booker.

So you want to 7 -- you want to set aside this post-Booker? 8 MR. GANNON: Yes, but. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Then perhaps we should have 10 the pre-argument. If we are taking this pre-Booker, I 11 would have throughout it is QED. 12 MR. GANNON: I disagree, Justice Breyer. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, imagine that the 14 that the Sentencing Commission -- imagine. It is not 15 true, but imagine that the Sentencing Commission had 16 written the following words: "Plea bargaining over 17 sentences is above," as many argued they should. They 18 write those words. Then they write the next word, 19 "exception." There is an exception, however; you are 20 permitted to plea bargain about a sentence insofar as 21 you argue about the range, where, within the range, it 22 applies. And of course when you apply the guidelines, 23 as when you always apply the guidelines, here or 24 elsewhere, departure is an unusual case. 25 Now, suppose those were the words that the
42

1 Commission had written. Could -- how -- is it possible 2 under those circumstances you would still be arguing 3 this sentence under the -- plea bargaining abolished 4 except over where within the range -- is it possible you 5 would be arguing that this is not based on the 6 guidelines? 7 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that had the 8 Sentencing Commission adopted such a position, and if it 9 were binding on the sentencing judge - 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, it is, because of 11 (a)(4). It used to be - 12 MR. GANNON: Which is -- well, because - 13 JUSTICE BREYER: -- because it says in the 14 sentencing guidelines, Judge, you will apply the 15 guideline, unless you find a circumstance the Commission 16 did not adequately take into account and in respect to 17 that, you may and must consult policy statements, but 18 guidelines and other materials. That is what it says. 19 Okay? 20 So take I am right on that. Assume I am 21 right. You can disagree with me, and I will look into 22 it. 23 MR. GANNON: Before Booker was decided, 24 it -- several of the circuits had already concluded that 25 a judge could accept a type C plea agreement that had a
43

1 sentence outside the range, and that that wasn't a 2 guidelines-based sentence. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: I want an answer to my 4 hypothetical, because I am trying to figure out how to 5 think about it, and you will help me if you answer my 6 hypothetical. 7 MR. GANNON: I think in those circumstances, 8 the Commission effectively would have repealed type C 9 plea agreements, because - 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's right. That's 11 what they wanted to do. Okay? Now, that is correct. 12 But you can still have them. 13 MR. GANNON: In your hypothetical, that is 14 what they wanted to do. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: You could still have them, 16 but they allow them only for the purpose of where within 17 the range the sentence will lie. Okay? 18 MR. GANNON: In those circumstances I think 19 that it would be fair to say that the sentence was based 20 on the guideline range - 21 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. 22 MR. GANNON: -- because the agreement hadn't 23 given any reason for the judge to -- to leave the 24 guidelines. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Correct. Now I would like

1 -- because if they wrote those words, C agreements are 2 abolished, but for where within the range -- okay? You 3 agree it would be based on the guidelines. Now what I'd 4 like you to do is to look at section 6B, whatever that 5 is. 6 MR. GANNON: 6B1.2 - 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. 8 MR. GANNON: -- is on the last page of 9 the - 10 JUSTICE BREYER: You tell me how this 11 differs from what I just said. 12 MR. GANNON: Well, I think it differs in two 13 key ways. First of all - 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: You were about to tell us 15 where it is? 16 MR. GANNON: It is on the last page of the 17 government's appendix which is the 16A of our brief. 18 And I think that it differs in two regards. First of 19 all, it -- it was a policy statement that even before 20 Booker was not binding on the sentencing judge. The 21 Commission determined that -- that this particular 22 guideline was not binding on judges the same way other 23 provisions in the guidelines where. 24 JUSTICE KAGAN: But I thought you just told 25 me that -- binding -- was not a part of the test
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 anymore. 2 MR. GANNON: Well, I -- but the question is 3 whether the judge even had to apply it at all, and the 4 judge did not need to. And -- the second point that I 5 was going to get to is that, unlike the colloquy that 6 Justice Breyer had with Mr. Heft earlier on, it doesn't 7 say the court may accept the agreement only if the court 8 is satisfied that it is within the guideline range. It 9 gives the court permission to accept the agreement. 10 This is a policy statement that gives the court 11 permission to accept the agreement when it is within the 12 guideline range or when there is a justifiable 13 departure, but it does not then say that everything else 14 is prohibited. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: It's only if. The words 16 there are "only if." It said should accept the 17 recommended sentence or a plea agreement requiring 18 imposition of a specific sentence only if the court is 19 satisfied either that such sentence is appropriate 20 within the guidelines, or departure. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're reading a different 22 -23 JUSTICE BREYER: I am? I'm reading 6B1.3, I 24 am reading commentary on the policy statement. 25 MR. GANNON: This is for 6B1.3?

GANNON: I've been looking at a text of 7 6B1.2 itself, which leaves out the word only. But I 8 think that here, even if you go back to the pre-Booker 9 practice, I think it was clear that judges were able to 10 depart from the guidelines to accept type C plea 11 agreements that imposed the sentence that was outside 12 the guideline range, and they -- and it wasn't 13 considered an abuse of discretion. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: I think you're right. You 15 see that is why I am having such a hard time. I am 16 having a hard time because first I put myself back in 17 the Commission days, and there the Commission did want 18 to abolish C. 19 MR. GANNON: Well- 20 JUSTICE BREYER: And then that is what it 21 intended to do and that is what it said it did, but for 22 what we are talking about. Now, you first raised the 23 question of did they have the authority to do that and I 24 agree with you that that is a legitimate question. I 25 made you assume it away, but I think it is a legitimate
47

1 question. 2 Now we have the additional question of how 3 Booker/Fanfan changes that and for what and when. Do 4 you see why I am puzzled and why I was asking you rather 5 harshly to start with my hypothetical? 6 MR. GANNON: I -- I do think that -- that 7 this gets puzzling as -- as you get further down, but I 8 think that this is the simplest case. It is a narrow 9 category of cases. We are dealing with a subset of one 10 particular type of plea agreement. It is distinct from 11 every other aspect of Federal sentencing. It's unlike 12 what happens when somebody goes to trial; in those 13 circumstances the judge clearly has the discretion to 14 apply the sentencing guidelines at the time of 15 sentencing. 16 It is different from regular type B plea 17 agreements where the parties have come up with an 18 agreement and the judge notwithstanding the agreement is 19 still free to determine the sentence that he or she 20 wants to determine. 21 This is a unique -- this uniquely gives a 22 high level of certainty to the parties about the 23 specific sentence that they negotiated. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't -- I am not in 25 disagreement with the point you're making, but I think
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that going back to what had bothered Justice Alito and 2 Justice Scalia on now that the guidelines are not 3 mandatory, is any sentence even under C really based on 4 the agreement? Because even a C agreement has to be 5 approved by the judge. 6 The legal consequence is not the agreement. 7 That doesn't sentence the defendant. It is the judge's 8 decision as to what the sentence should be which he 9 denotes in accepting the agreement that binds. 10 And I think -- I may be making Justice 11 Breyer's argument -- that if under the policy statement 12 and it's clear what the judge did here, if the judge 13 feels bound by the agreement or otherwise to calculate a 14 sentence in the guidelines and impose one in the 15 guidelines, how can you say that the legal effect is not 16 the guideline sentence? 17 MR. GANNON: Well, because I think that the 18 relevant question for purposes of both 3582(c)(2) and 19 the policy statements that the court said in Dillon 20 controls the -- the process of implementing 3582(c)(2), 21 is what did the judge do at the time of imposing the 22 sentence? And so although it is true that the judge 23 generally will consider how the type C specific sentence 24 that the parties have agreed upon corresponds to a 25 guidelines analysis at the time of deciding whether to
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 accept the plea agreement, the relevant phrase in 2 1B1.10(b)1 which is -- which is on page 8A of the 3 government's appendix is that the judge is supposed to 4 go back and look at what -- to only make substitutions 5 for the corresponding guideline provisions that were 6 applied when the defendant was sentenced. 7 And so when you have a type C plea agreement 8 that has a specific sentence even under the terms of 9 this agreement, the only thing that the judge considered 10 when he decided the sentence was going to be 106 months 11 with respect to the term of imprisonment was the binding 12 plea agreement. That is what rule 11(c)(1)(C) required. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- no. Because you're 14 assuming that the agreement was automatically binding on 15 the judge. 16 MR. GANNON: It was - 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The judge was always 18 capable of saying at the time of sentence I won't accept 19 the 106. If he had calculated the guidelines and if it 20 turned out that the guidelines called for 240 to 360, he 21 could have said easily no, that is so far outside of the 22 guideline range with no justification that I am not 23 going to accept -- impose the sentence. You could 24 withdraw your agreement and do whatever you're going to 25 do.

1 MR. GANNON: And had he not done that the 2 proceeding would have occurred differently and it may 3 not even have right occurred then, and -- and I think 4 because under Rule 11 if he was rejecting the plea 5 agreement and -- and the 106 months that the parties had 6 agreed to, he would have to give the defendant the right 7 to withdraw the plea at that point. So the government 8 would have been released from its obligations; the 9 parties -- the defendant could have gone to trial. He 10 could have -- he could have continued to plead guilty. 11 The parties could have come up with a type plea -- B 12 plea agreement. The parties may have asked for time to 13 renegotiate a different type C agreement. We do not 14 know what would have happened in those circumstances. 15 And as you pointed out before, Justice 16 Sotomayor, this is not about asking the judge to step 17 into the shoes of the parties and renegotiate what the 18 agreement would have been had the judge decided to 19 reject it the first time around. Instead 3582(c)(2) 20 contemplates a limited process by which the judge will 21 reapply those provisions of the guidelines that he 22 applied the first time around and -- and make the 23 substitution that is now called for by the retroactively 24 applicable change. But here because the judge didn't 25 actually make that application at the time of
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 sentencing, the judge did not actually have to apply the 2 drug quantity table. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I am not following that 4 argument for this reason. It seems to me if you ask 5 what did the judge apply at the time he imposed the 6 original sentence, well, it has got to be the 7 guidelines, because first the agreement provides for it; 8 then he says I am going to wait for the probation report 9 so I can see what the calculation is, whether I agree 10 with it; and then he gives him a sentence that is 11 precisely within the guidelines. 12 So if you asked me to describe what that 13 sentence was -- of what was it, 46 to 106 days -- I say 14 that was a guideline sentence. It was right there 15 within the brackets that -- the guidelines. So why 16 wasn't it a guideline sentence? 17 MR. GANNON: Because for purposes of the 18 term of imprisonment the judge was not actually applying 19 the guidelines at that point. He did so for purposes of 20 the fine. He ended up actually waiving the relevant 21 fine, but those type C plea agreement here called for 22 the judge to apply the guidelines with respect to the 23 fine and did not call for the judge to apply the 24 guidelines with respect to the term of imprisonment. He 25 knew that it was within what the PSR had calculated as
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the guideline range and he concluded that that was the 2 applicable guideline range which he needed to do for 3 purposes of calculating the fine and other things, but 4 it wasn't actually the basis for the sentence. 5 The basis for the sentence was the plea 6 agreement that he accepted, and there it was the 7 parties' agreement. And there are all sorts of things 8 that went into the parties' agreement that the judge 9 does not have the wherewithal to reconsider in 10 retrospect. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought one of the 12 things in the plea agreement was that the -- that the 13 judge would have the right to himself calculate the 14 guideline range. 15 MR. GANNON: Yes. And that specifically 16 contemplated in Rule 11(c) and in the guidelines, that 17 the judge may postpone acceptance of the plea agreement 18 until after the presentence report is prepared. And the 19 judge did do that here. So he was aware of what the PSR 20 recommended, but once, and had he decided that he did 21 not like the 106 month sentence and he wanted to 22 preserve his sentencing discretion, the option at that 23 point was to have rejected the plea agreement, at which 24 point the parties would have been free to do different 25 things. And among other things, the Government could
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 then have then argued for a higher sentence within the 2 range. Could have argued that the criminal history 3 failed to represent the seriousness of the defendant's 4 criminal past. Could have argued for an upward 5 departure even, but the Defendant got the benefit of the 6 106 month agreement of not having the Government raise 7 any of those other arguments at that time. And now he 8 is asking for essentially another bite of the apple and 9 we think that because the basis for the sentence was 10 indeed the negotiation and the agreement between the 11 parties, that the court of appeals decision was correct. 12 If there are no further questions. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 14 Mr. Gannon. 15 Mr. Heft, you have three minutes remaining. 16 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. HEFT, JR., 17 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 18 MR. HEFT: Thank you, Your Honor. Just a 19 couple of points. First of all, the record here leaves 20 no doubt that the judge based his sentence on the 21 guidelines. The sentencing transcript specifically 22 states that the judge and I'd like to quote this, this 23 is at page 47 of the joint appendix and I quote, "the 24 court will adopt the findings of the probation officer 25 disclosed in the probation report and application of the
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 guidelines as set out therein." On page 48 of the joint 2 appendix the judge says, having considered the advisory 3 guidelines, he went on to impose that sentence. So it 4 is quite clear that the judge and even in his statements 5 of reasons on page 95 of the joint appendix, again 6 reaffirmed that this sentence was based on the 7 guidelines. 8 Now, the other point that I'd like to make 9 is that the Government acknowledges that it has carved 10 out a very small exception to its argument that C pleas 11 regarding specific sentences and sentencing ranges are 12 not eligible for (c)(2) relief. But it seems to me that 13 reading, taking the Government position into account, if 14 this plea agreement had not stated 106 months, then 15 Mr. Freeman's under the terms of this plea agreement in 16 the Government's view and under the Government's 17 argument of what exception exists under the C pleas for 18 purposes of 3582, Mr. Freeman would be eligible for the 19 relief that was granted. And we would simply urge the 20 Court in this case to adopt a rule that does not exclude 21 specific sentences and C pleas for eligibility in 3582. 22 Thank you. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 24 The case is submitted. 25 (Whereupon, at 11:12 a.m., the case in the
