2 (10:13 a.m.)

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Hill v. McDonough.

5 Mr. Doss.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF D. TODD DOSS

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8 MR. DOSS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10 In Nelson v. Campbell, this Court held that a

11 challenge to procedures to execute an inmate may be

12 brought in a section 1983 action unless the challenge

13 would necessarily prevent the State from carrying out

14 its execution. Mr. Hill does not challenge the State's

15 right to execute him by lethal injection, but instead,

16 only challenges the particular protocol Florida

17 Department of Corrections in their discretion has

18 adopted. Mr. Hill's claim, thus, does not necessarily

19 prevent his execution, and his claim falls squarely

20 within the scope of Nelson, as announced by this Court.

21 The current claim -- the only focus of that

22 claim is the discretionary choice of the particular

23 injection procedure that has been chosen by the Florida

24 Department of Corrections. Therefore, it does not

25 violate Nelson because the relief sought would not

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 necessarily prevent the State of Florida from carrying

2 out its execution. The State could still carry out the

3 execution through a more humane means by altering the

4 particular protocol that -- that they have adopted.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which you decline to

6 specify. Right?

7 MR. DOSS: I'm sorry, Justice. I didn't hear

8 the first part of your question.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: By a means which you decline

10 to specify, so that if they come up with some other

11 means, you could -- you could object to that as well I

12 assume.

13 MR. DOSS: Well, there -- in -- in answer to

14 your question, there's never been a -- a requirement

15 that a section 1983 plaintiff must plead a

16 constitutionally acceptable alternative.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I understand that. But

18 I'm just -- I'm just pointing out what -- what becomes

19 available to you if we -- if we give you the relief you

20 request.

21 MR. DOSS: Well, this --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- we -- we say this --

23 this procedure is no good. The State comes up with

24 another procedure, and you challenge that one. Right?

25 And -- and another few years go by.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DOSS: I -- I respectfully disagree with

2 the fact that it would just leave open a total series

3 of challenges.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why?

5 MR. DOSS: The State -- the State would have

6 the opportunity to come in and propose a acceptable

7 alternative. Just like any other finding of

8 unconstitutionality, once they propose that

9 alternative, we can challenge that if something is --

10 is not acceptable, or accept the -- the proposed

11 alternative and the court enters a -- a consent decree.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you think that the --

13 the way you would proceed in trial court is the trial

14 court finds that this is no good, and -- and then the

15 trial court proposes an alternative, or -- or invites

16 the State to propose to the trial court an alternative,

17 and then asks whether you agree to that alternative.

18 And if you don't, the trial court makes the decision

19 whether the alternative is -- is constitutional or not.

20 MR. DOSS: This -- that's --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not bad.

22 MR. DOSS: -- that's entirely correct, and I

23 think we've seen that in -- in a couple of the cases

24 that are out there. Mr. Brown's case out of North

25 Carolina followed that track. Mr. Morales' case

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 somewhat followed that track, although through no fault

2 of Mr. Morales, California wasn't able to carry through

3 on the alternative that they chose because the

4 anesthesiologists decided to not participate. But it

5 -- but it just proceeded to basically an up or down

6 ruling upon the proposed alternatives. So I -- I would

7 disagree that there's a seriatim effect of -- of just

8 perpetual litigation over whether the alternatives --

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're envisioning that

10 one case will take care of it. That is, if the Court

11 rules against you, that's the end of it. You can't

12 come back with another inadequacy because you'd be

13 barred by claim preclusion.

14 On the other hand, if the State comes up with

15 an acceptable alternative, you agree to it. That's one

16 thing. The Court holds -- but there wouldn't be a

17 second episode I think. One way or another this

18 proceeding would end it.

19 MR. DOSS: The only -- the only way I would

20 foresee a second episode is if they -- if they proposed

21 a second unconstitutional procedure.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that probably

23 will be what will be alleged. Of course, you don't

24 know when -- at this proceeding, we have no idea, if we

25 rule in your favor, what alternative the State is going

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to provide, and I am willing to bet whatever that

2 alternative is that it will be subject to a challenge

3 under a new 1983 suit. There would be no claim

4 preclusion if you didn't know what the alternative was

5 at this point. Right?

6 MR. DOSS: That's correct, although it would

7 proceed to basically an up or down ruling, just as it

8 did in -- in the Brown case and the -- the Morales

9 case.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: In this very case, you're

11 saying the court would -- would rule on the State's

12 proposed alternative. Right?

13 MR. DOSS: That's correct.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: But if you disagreed with

15 that, you could appeal it up again. Right? You can go

16 to the court of appeals --

17 MR. DOSS: That's correct.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and then seek cert up

19 here. Right?

20 MR. DOSS: That -- that would be correct.

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: May -- just as a -- maybe

22 this is technical, but what did you ask for for relief?

23 Did you ask for relief that the State be enjoined from

24 using this method, or that the State be enjoined from

25 executing him until an acceptable method had been

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 found? Because in the first case, the door

2 theoretically is open to seriatim 1983 actions, and in

3 the second case, presumably the issue would be resolved

4 in this one case, as you suggest. So which did you ask

5 for? Injunction against this or injunction until an

6 acceptable alternative came up?

7 MR. DOSS: We asked for -- for two -- two

8 injunctions: one a preliminary injunction allowing the

9 -- the Court to be able to consider the case, and then

10 the way the prayer for relief was worded is, is that we

11 asked for a permanent injunction barring the State of

12 Florida from executing Mr. Hill as they currently

13 intend.

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if that's -- if that's

15 the relief you get, then the door would be open to

16 successive different 1983 actions every time the State

17 comes up with -- with a new protocol. Whereas, if what

18 the -- if -- if the trial court -- if you succeed at

19 this stage, if we say, yes, you're -- you're properly

20 in court and you go ahead and litigate it, if the trial

21 court, in fact, awards not the injunction that you

22 asked for but the injunction saying do not execute this

23 person until a constitutional protocol has been

24 proposed and accepted by the court, then everything

25 will get resolved in this one action, as you suggest.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 So would -- would you consent to -- as it

2 were, to an amendment of your prayer for relief so that

3 the injunction will be in such a form that everything

4 can get resolved in this one case?

5 MR. DOSS: In -- in the sense of -- of the

6 State of Florida proposing a -- a -- hopefully a

7 constitutional way of executing --

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

9 MR. DOSS: -- Mr. Hill, where it wouldn't

10 give rise to another 1983 action?

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right.

12 MR. DOSS: Yes.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you would agree to

14 that?

15 MR. DOSS: Yes.

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do you have

17 confidence --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said --

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- do you have confidence

20 that Florida can do that?

21 MR. DOSS: Based upon the litigation that

22 we've seen around the country, yes, I think there are

23 acceptable ways to -- to do it out there. Whether they

24 would choose that way or not, I don't know because the

25 way Florida's system is designed is -- is that it's not

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 statutorily mandated as to -- as to particular

2 protocol that's utilized. It's left totally with the

3 Secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections.

4 It's not subject to any rulemaking or any

5 administrative procedures as far as promulgating those

6 rules. It's -- it's just within the Secretary's

7 discretion.

8 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you --

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, one -- one of the

10 circumstances that -- that was raised by the

11 questioning is this. States generally have the defense

12 of laches. They -- they require the petition to be

13 filed within a reasonable time. With changes in

14 pharmacology, the laches defense will not usually be

15 available. And under the proposal that the -- the

16 State resolves it once and for all, I suppose the State

17 couldn't adopt a new protocol that it thought was

18 better, more humane, without risking more litigation.

19 So it -- it really is a disincentive for the States to

20 try to make the procedure less painful for the -- for

21 the accused.

22 MR. DOSS: Well, within -- within the Eighth

23 Amendment jurisprudence of -- of the evolution of -- of

24 Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, we've seen hanging go

25 by the wayside. We've effectively seen electrocution

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 go by the wayside. As we advance as a society and as

2 we advance within our knowledge of what's going on --

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Precisely. And that's

4 going to be true with every new protocol.

5 MR. DOSS: That's an -- that's an evolution

6 over time. It's --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said there were other

8 States. You mentioned California. There was a

9 proposal by the State. It couldn't be executed. What

10 was the experience -- you mentioned a couple of other

11 cases where the particular combination of drugs was

12 successfully challenged, but then the State did what?

13 MR. DOSS: In Mr. Brown's case in North

14 Carolina, my understanding was -- is that the State had

15 went and purchased a device to make sure that he was

16 actually unconscious during the procedure and wasn't

17 subject to the excruciating pain that's been detailed

18 within -- within the briefs. That actually was

19 challenged because Mr. Brown's attorneys didn't think

20 that the -- the people that were monitoring the machine

21 were properly trained. The court ruled against them,

22 and as we know, Mr. Brown was -- was executed. It

23 didn't result in the series of challenges as -- as many

24 are obviously concerned about.

25 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you agree that that was

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 not a -- that method of execution is not a violation of

2 the Eighth Amendment?

3 MR. DOSS: As far as using the machinery that

4 was used in Brown?

5 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes.

6 MR. DOSS: I -- I don't know enough about --

7 about that machine to -- to accurately comment on -- on

8 that. I know that the challenges that were brought in

9 Brown wasn't necessarily regarding the machine itself,

10 but it was the qualifications of -- of the people

11 monitoring the machine and whether they had the

12 authority and ability to intervene in the execution

13 itself. And I believe that that was the challenge that

14 was ruled upon by the court in Mr. Brown's case before

15 he was executed.

16 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you know of any method

17 that has been used -- used throughout the country that

18 is not a violation of the Eighth Amendment?

19 MR. DOSS: As far as -- as far as this

20 particular protocol, this particular protocol that's --

21 that's utilized and that we're -- we're challenging is

22 unconstitutional because of the excruciating pain. If

23 the -- if the sedative works, and there's no -- and --

24 and the person is not in -- not in wanton and

25 gratuitous type of -- of pain, as -- as this Court's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 precedents hold, that would be constitutional. It's

2 the -- it's the evidence that's coming forward that

3 this is not what's happening that gives rise to our

4 claim that -- that we would like to be able to litigate

5 in a 1983 action so that we can get those facts before

6 the court.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it only excruciating pain

8 that the Eighth Amendment prohibits or is it any pain?

9 Does the Eighth Amendment require painless execution?

10 MR. DOSS: No, absolutely not. It's -- it's

11 that it's -- it's that it's wanton and -- and

12 gratuitous pain.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, when you say wanton

14 and gratuitous, you're -- you're saying any pain that

15 can be eliminated must be eliminated. Otherwise, it's

16 gratuitous I assume.

17 MR. DOSS: It's -- it's gratuitous when it's

18 beyond what's -- what's necessary, and whenever the --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. So if there's any way

20 of -- of execution that is totally painless, that --

21 that must be pursued.

22 MR. DOSS: If there were a way to do that, I

23 -- I would agree with that.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where do you derive

25 that from? I mean, gee, you know, that -- that was

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 certainly never the principle evident in -- in

2 executions in the past. Hanging was -- was not a --

3 you know, a quick and easy way to go. You would have

4 thought they would have required a firing squad instead

5 or something like that. I -- I just don't know where

6 you're deriving this principle that there cannot be any

7 pain associated with the execution.

8 MR. DOSS: I --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: I can understand

10 excruciating pain, but -- but you -- you want to press

11 it to the point where there can't be any pain

12 associated. Any pain that can be eliminated must be

13 eliminated. That seems to me a very extreme

14 proposition.

15 MR. DOSS: The -- the -- what -- what we've

16 detailed here in our complaint is an extreme and

17 tortuous method of -- of death. At this point --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I understand what

19 you're challenging here. But what -- what alternative

20 would be acceptable to you? Only one -- only one that

21 -- that, to the maximum extent possible, eliminates all

22 pain. Isn't that right?

23 MR. DOSS: Well, when you look at the -- when

24 you look at -- at Morales and Brown, both of those that

25 -- that were proposed were eliminating -- for instance,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 one of the options within Mr. Morales' case was that

2 only the sodium thiopental be used eliminating the

3 pancuronium bromide and the potassium chloride. The

4 State of California, for -- for whatever reason, did

5 not -- did not choose that and went, instead, and tried

6 to use the same protocol and bringing in

7 anesthesiologists that were properly trained and

8 qualified to determine whether or not Mr. Morales was,

9 in fact, anesthetized to -- to a degree where he would

10 not feel that pain. That -- that is -- that is an

11 example of a proper procedure being -- being come up

12 with -- or being dealt with.

13 As well, Mr. Brown -- and -- and thing is, is

14 that for -- there's -- there's never been a requirement

15 for -- for us to plead this. The reason being is -- is

16 this Court's case law within -- for example, Lewis v.

17 Casey shows the -- the strong deference that this Court

18 gives to States in -- in coming up with the prison

19 procedures. That's not an execution case, but here the

20 Florida courts -- not Florida courts, but the Florida

21 officials within the Department of Correction -- they

22 know their facilities. They know what's capable of --

23 of being done there or not.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it be -- if --

25 if in the future, if States specify the method of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 execution in the sentence, then you would not have a

2 1983 action. Is that correct? Because you would then

3 be challenging the sentence, and it would have to be

4 brought under habeas.

5 MR. DOSS: If the particular protocol that was

6 alleged in the sentence, yes, it would be ripe at that

7 point in time as opposed to Florida's system where it's

8 within -- it's within the discretion of the Department

9 of Correction to change it at any time. We've seen

10 that happen whenever the electric chair litigation was

11 going on, that they changed these procedures over time,

12 adding and detracting different things.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but -- but you -- you

14 -- their procedure was set forth in a -- in a notice, a

15 regulation or something. You -- you had notice of what

16 procedure they intended to use several years ago,

17 didn't you?

18 MR. DOSS: The only --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, you're saying they

20 could change it in the future, but sure, of course.

21 Any -- any agency can change its -- its regulations.

22 But didn't you know that this is the procedure they

23 intended to use several years ago?

24 MR. DOSS: No, Your Honor. It was -- what

25 they relied upon was what was -- what was detailed in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Sims, which was 6 years ago. But with the -- with the

2 discretion that Florida Department of Corrections has

3 and that they've exhibited in the past, that they've

4 utilized that discretion whenever we were having the

5 electric chair litigation going on, we can't presume

6 that.

7 The added problem is --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you have to wait to --

9 you have to wait to the eve of execution before --

10 before you think you have a -- a ripe claim under --

11 under habeas.

12 MR. DOSS: Under -- under Florida's scheme,

13 yes, we have to wait because they have the complete

14 discretion. We have no access to be able to get the

15 public records. In fact, we've been denied throughout.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Congress has the complete

17 discretion to change the statutes it's enacted, but

18 that doesn't mean that you can't change -- you can't

19 challenge a statute now because it might be changed

20 before -- before the action you want to take occurs.

21 You can challenge it now. And it seems to me it's the

22 same thing with the method of execution prescribed by

23 -- by an administrative agency in -- in a State.

24 MR. DOSS: If Congress has the situation set

25 up that Florida does not engage in -- in rulemaking.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 They don't go through an orderly administrative

2 process, taking public input and having people come and

3 participate in that. It's totally --

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what did they have?

5 There was the Sims case. No -- no -- certainly not in

6 the legislation. There's no rule that emerges. But

7 you did know that there was a lethal injection

8 procedure that had been prescribed for another

9 prisoner, and yet you didn't challenge the lethal

10 injection at that time. Why did you wait until so

11 late?

12 MR. DOSS: Because -- because that claim was

13 not ripe at that time, because we didn't know what

14 would be utilized whenever it came to Mr. Hill being

15 executed. Our knowledge as to how Florida Department

16 of Corrections utilizes that discretion has been that

17 they actually used that discretion in the past. We

18 have not been able to get any records post-Sims

19 regarding their procedures, regarding the protocol --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have they, in fact,

21 changed the procedure for the lethal injection?

22 MR. DOSS: I don't have any public records to

23 -- to be able to say one way or another. We were

24 denied all public records whenever we were proceeding

25 in State court.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: When did you ask for the

2 public -- when did you ask for the -- a -- a statement

3 of the protocol that would be used in your case?

4 MR. DOSS: It was December the 8th is

5 whenever it began, and then pursuant to the court's --

6 the trial court's order that was entered in that case,

7 the State's response came on December 19th. The court

8 ruled on December 23rd. The rehearing was denied on

9 the 30th, and we filed our briefs in the Florida

10 Supreme Court on January 3rd.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. How did

12 you get into the court if you didn't know what protocol

13 they were going to use?

14 MR. DOSS: Once --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: You say you didn't know it

16 until the 19th when your case was already in the court.

17 What -- what were you challenging?

18 MR. DOSS: What we -- what had happened is --

19 is whenever the -- whenever the death warrant was

20 signed on November 29th, that put into play Florida

21 Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.852(h)(3) which then

22 entitles us to more records that we are not entitled to

23 before a warrant is signed. At -- at that point, we

24 filed our records request, and the trial court, indeed,

25 put forth their order as to when everybody was to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 respond and have various pleadings in. We --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. How did the

3 trial court get into it? Does the records request go

4 through -- through a trial court?

5 MR. DOSS: Yes.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is the -- the

7 action that you're bringing? An action for records

8 request?

9 MR. DOSS: Yes. It's under Florida Rule of

10 Criminal Procedure. It's geared specifically to death-

11 sentenced individuals as opposed to being -- we don't

12 have available what's under Florida statute. Chapter

13 119 is not available to a death-sentenced inmate. So

14 we must proceed through the 3.852 procedures, and that

15 was not activated until the point in time that the

16 warrant was actually signed.

17 We filed other pleadings in the court that

18 were denied regarding mental retardation, regarding a

19 Roper claim, and various other -- other claims.

20 Ultimately, we also filed in regards to the

21 public records claim and us being denied the public

22 records and the ability to assess the protocol.

23 Florida --

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I ask you to

25 clarify one thing? I take it, at this point, there

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 isn't any question about the -- the amounts and

2 ingredients that will be used in -- if -- if the

3 execution goes forward. But my recollection is that

4 you said that your -- your request for a specification

5 of this formula or protocol was denied by Florida. Did

6 you ever, as a result of your records request or

7 otherwise, get a statement directly from Florida to you

8 that the following proportions of chemicals will be

9 used?

10 MR. DOSS: Within the -- within the public

11 records proceeding, it was referenced that it would be

12 the same as -- as Sims. Florida Department of

13 Corrections --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: But until you went into that

15 proceeding, I take it, you had asked Florida to specify

16 and Florida said, no, it would not do so?

17 MR. DOSS: We had asked for the records and

18 had requested the records that would specify and any

19 written procedures and protocol, as well as the records

20 from -- from prior executions. They fought that and

21 prevailed in the trial court.

22 And in the Florida Supreme Court, we had also

23 sought records from the medical examiner that does the

24 autopsies on executed individuals, as well as various

25 other officials we thought might have information. We

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 were -- we were given nothing and they objected to us

2 receiving any records whatsoever.

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Did -- did you ever say to

4 -- to any Florida official, please tell me what the

5 chemicals are and the amounts that will be used --

6 MR. DOSS: We --

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- not asking for records,

8 just asking for a statement about what they were going

9 to do?

10 MR. DOSS: It -- it came forward at the -- at

11 the hearing regarding the public records that it was

12 going to be the Sims -- that it was going to be the

13 Sims procedure.

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I guess before you went

15 into court with a public records action, did you ever

16 say to somebody, tell us what you're going to do?

17 MR. DOSS: By our public records request,

18 yes. If -- if Your Honor is asking if I spoke to the

19 --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what I'm getting at

21 is --

22 MR. DOSS: -- Department of Corrections, no.

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- there -- there are ways

24 to find out. One would be to ask. One would be to

25 chop the door down with an ax to find out if there's a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 statement hidden inside. Did you ever try the easy way

2 and simply say to them, will you specify for us what

3 you're going to do and how you're going to do this?

4 MR. DOSS: That was essentially done at the

5 public records hearing on December 19th whenever they

6 came in and said it was -- that it was Sims.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

8 MR. DOSS: The -- the thing is, is --

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you -- you

10 alleged in your complaint -- I'm looking at footnote 3

11 -- that you assumed they were going to follow the same

12 protocol as in Sims.

13 MR. DOSS: Because of their -- because of --

14 of the representations that were made during the public

15 records litigation. That was based upon -- that was

16 what we based our assumption on, knowing that they

17 still had the ability to change it all the way up until

18 the date that Mr. Hill was scheduled to be executed.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they still do, but

20 you're here. I mean, they -- they still have the

21 opportunity to change it, but you're here challenging

22 it even though it is still changeable. Right?

23 MR. DOSS: They -- yes. Because of the way

24 Florida operates with the total discretion and -- and

25 the refusal to give any public records regarding this,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 yes, we are in the dark regarding it. They could --

2 they could alleviate that situation by doing an

3 administrative rulemaking process, that that rule is

4 then in place, and with that rule in place, it would be

5 ripe at that point because at that point they're

6 constrained to follow the rule as opposed to having the

7 liberty to -- to change the procedures as they -- as

8 they deem fit at the last minute.

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I just clarify one

10 thing for myself? Do I correctly understand that the

11 Federal district court -- I'm not talking about the

12 State court -- did not rule on the merits of your

13 claim, but merely held that 1983 is not the proper

14 method of pursuing the claim?

15 MR. DOSS: That's correct.

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: So that there hasn't been a

17 decision by a Federal judge on whether or not there's

18 merit to your case.

19 MR. DOSS: That is correct.

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's just a question of

21 which -- whether you do it by way of habeas corpus or

22 by 1983.

23 MR. DOSS: That is -- that is correct, and it

24 was recharacterized as -- as a successive habeas

25 petition rather than a 1983 action.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: And I suppose it's entirely

2 possible that if the judge then decided it is really --

3 if we said it should have been a 1983 action, the judge

4 could say, well, okay, even under 1983 the State has

5 the defense of laches and you still lose. I mean, you

6 -- we don't know what's going to happen if we find out

7 -- if we agree with what your argument in this Court

8 is. Is that right?

9 MR. DOSS: It would go back for -- for an

10 analysis as to the equities of the situation, and --

11 and that being an intensely fact-bound procedure, the

12 district court is actually in -- in a better position

13 to go ahead and -- and be able to make that analysis

14 there at the district court level, a Gomez analysis as

15 to the equities that are involved within the situation.

16 So as -- as we sit here today, there has not

17 been any ruling on the merits of -- of this, and there

18 hasn't been any evidence produced in -- in any court

19 through testimony whatsoever regarding the issues of

20 the protocol and -- and things of -- of that nature

21 that we've been discussing here this morning.

22 And I think that -- that whenever -- whenever

23 you -- you look at -- actually if the Court doesn't

24 have any more questions, I'm going to reserve the

25 balance of my time.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

2 Ms. Snurkowski, we'll hear now from you.

3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAROLYN M. SNURKOWSKI

4 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

5 MS. SNURKOWSKI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may

6 it please the Court:

7 The State is here today to suggest that the

8 method that -- to challenge these claims is by habeas

9 corpus, and that the Federal district court, as well as

10 the Eleventh Circuit, was correct in finding that the

11 district court had correctly found it had no

12 jurisdiction because, in fact, it was a functional

13 equivalent of the habeas corpus.

14 But to -- to address some of the issues that

15 were currently brought before the Court today with

16 regard to the ability of the defendant to come forward

17 and discern what exactly was the method by which

18 Florida was intending to execute him, the record bears

19 out that, in fact, the Sims case was in the public

20 domain and, in fact, is the method by which Florida

21 does execute individuals. There was --

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's no statute and

23 there's no regulation that requires Florida to do that.

24 MS. SNURKOWSKI: These -- there is no

25 specific statute. The statute itself merely says that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 lethal injection is the method by which Florida is to

2 execute individuals.

3 The Department of Corrections, through

4 rulemaking process internally, provides protocols for

5 the execution day and other protocols with regard to

6 the execution team performing its function on that

7 given day and -- and hours leading up to that. And

8 that has not been changed nor modified, nor has it been

9 challenged --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is no statute,

11 no regulation. That means the executive can do what it

12 will. There's nothing that binds them to the way it

13 was done in Sims' case.

14 MS. SNURKOWSKI: That is correct, to the

15 extent that there's no statutory provision or

16 regulatory rule because, in fact, under Florida -- the

17 Florida legislature has exempted rulemaking of the

18 Department of Corrections with regard to executions.

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I suppose that's --

20 that's the complaint. If there was a procedure in

21 place, we could address it. If Florida reserves to

22 itself the ability to change at any time, well, that's

23 -- we want to be told what it will be in our particular

24 case so we have a target that we can aim at.

25 MS. SNURKOWSKI: And I understand that, but

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the State would contend that based on the fact that

2 there have 16 executions since the time that Sims has

3 occurred and all those executions have been performed

4 exactly as the manner in which Sims has occurred, and

5 that there has not been any challenge to a deviance

6 from that, and in fact, the Florida Supreme Court has

7 ratified again in this case, when Mr. Hill brought his

8 Eighth Amendment claim, that Sims was the method of

9 execution in Florida, I think we have a very reasoned

10 determination that, in fact, the method of execution,

11 as it has been proposed in Sims, is currently the

12 method of execution that we utilize.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: But what he -- I -- I take

14 it the ripeness issue is -- he delayed in bringing it

15 because he wasn't certain what you'd do. And -- and

16 one of the reasons, I think, would be that it's only

17 recently there was an article in the Lancet --

18 MS. SNURKOWSKI: Correct.

19 JUSTICE BREYER: -- that says the -- in the

20 opinion of the doctors who wrote it, a significant

21 number of executed people are conscious when they die,

22 and that's painful.

23 And then it's been suggested there are ways

24 around that. Just give them more sodium pentothal or

25 have a doctor or somebody there to make certain the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 individual is unconscious at the time that the death-

2 causing drugs take effect.

3 All right. Now, that doesn't seem too

4 difficult. Maybe it's difficult, but it doesn't seem

5 too difficult. So why can't they think, you know,

6 Florida -- they can read there too. They have people

7 who read these articles, and indeed, maybe they'll just

8 do it. They don't have any real interest in -- in

9 causing suffering. Why don't they just do it?

10 And so he thinks, up until the last minute,

11 that maybe Florida will just do it, and lo and behold,

12 when the death warrant is actually executed, it now

13 begins to appear that they won't. And therefore, at

14 that time, he brings the case.

15 Now, I've spun out a story which seems

16 probable, but if it's true, it would be very

17 understandable why this wasn't ripe before the

18 execution warrant is issued and thereafter it is. Now,

19 what is your reply on the ripeness question?

20 MS. SNURKOWSKI: Well, my reply on the

21 ripeness question is, first of all, that I don't

22 believe that your scenario -- while I'll accept your

23 scenario as your scenario, it is not accurate with

24 regard to what occurred in Florida.

25 But apart from that, there has not been a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 change and nor has there been any allegations by the

2 defendant. He certainly, as you have indicated, could

3 have read and, in fact, did read the Lancet article and

4 made no statements with regard to his allegations --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: -- my -- my little story was

6 inaccurate as to Florida or accurate as to Florida.

7 MS. SNURKOWSKI: I'm sorry?

8 JUSTICE BREYER: Is the kind of thing I was

9 explaining why it would be ripe I think -- is that

10 accurate enough for the purposes of ripeness as to what

11 happened in Florida?

12 MS. SNURKOWSKI: No. And my answer, I would

13 suggest to you, is no --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: No.

15 MS. SNURKOWSKI: -- because I think it's part

16 of the pleadings. I mean, he certainly had the

17 wherewithal. If he felt that there was another manner

18 by which it could have been changed or that the

19 Department of Corrections, in this particular instance,

20 was suddenly going to -- now aware of the Lancet

21 article, would change its method, he has not made any

22 allegations of that, nor has he asked. And that was

23 one of the questions that was postulated to him, the

24 fact that in -- that he never asked.

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would he have to come up

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 --

2 MS. SNURKOWSKI: Excuse me.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- with, as you suggest,

4 an alternative that would be acceptable? Suppose there

5 had been a hearing and it was proved more probable than

6 not that in some cases -- not in all, but in some cases

7 -- use of this injection would cause excruciating pain.

8 Would the Petitioner who is objecting being exposed to

9 that have to come up with an alternative in order to

10 avoid the risk of excruciating pain?

11 MS. SNURKOWSKI: Well, it seems to me, based

12 on this Court's decision in Nelson, that that was the

13 focal point of why relief was granted in the fashion it

14 was, that it was a proper issue to rely in 1983

15 because, in fact, there might be a -- he had proposed a

16 mechanism that might be alternative mechanism that was

17 accepted by the government. In this instance, it's --

18 the record is silent and -- which goes --

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, my question to you

20 is -- I take it you're answering yes, that if they

21 prove that some people will be subject to excruciating

22 pain, that's not good enough unless the Petitioner

23 proposes an alternative, that it's all right for the

24 State to expose someone to the risk of what has -- what

25 has been determined to be the risk of excruciating pain

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 as long as the Petitioner himself doesn't come up with

2 an alternative.

3 MS. SNURKOWSKI: Well, I think the answer is

4 twofold. First of all, the fact that the articles out

5 there reflect that there's a potential that that could

6 happen, there's not been evidence that it has occurred

7 or has happened, which has been necessarily what is the

8 precursor to when there has been changes in the method

9 of execution because there has been a history where, in

10 fact, a botched execution has occurred no matter what

11 the method may have been.

12 The second part is that there has not be a --

13 a specific showing in this particular case, nor an

14 allegation for that matter, that any kind of event in

15 this particular case would, in fact, cause excruciating

16 or any kind of pain --

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, because there's been

18 no hearing. We've never gotten past is this -- can you

19 open the door through 1983, and I -- I still don't

20 understand what your answer is to my question.

21 Now, I'm supposing that we do have the 1983

22 hearing, and the judge says, yes, I agree with the

23 Petitioner's experts. In some cases there will be

24 excruciating pain. Then you say, but, Judge, they

25 haven't come up with an alternative.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. SNURKOWSKI: Correct.

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the judge says, you're

3 both right. Some people have excruciating pain, but

4 there's been no alternative suggested. Bottom line of

5 that particular case would be?

6 MS. SNURKOWSKI: That, in fact, I think that

7 he has to make some colorable showing of an alternative

8 that would be acceptable to him based on the procedures

9 because, again, the second prong of that seems to me --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the answer is yes.

11 MS. SNURKOWSKI: Yes, Your Honor. I'm sorry.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The court, having found

13 that some people will be subject to excruciating pain,

14 still no Eighth Amendment violation because the

15 Petitioner hasn't come up with an alternative.

16 MS. SNURKOWSKI: Yes.

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: What is the source of his

18 obligation to do this? I mean, why does he have an

19 obligation under the Eighth Amendment or under any

20 other ground to tell the State how to execute people?

21 MS. SNURKOWSKI: Well, I think the Court in

22 its Nelson opinion suggested that that was a means --

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: That -- that was a fact in

24 Nelson, but my question to you is if -- if we were to

25 agree with you and say that that, in fact, is a -- is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 an element of a 1983 action here, what would be the

2 source of -- of the -- the conclusion that -- that he

3 has to propose a less painful alternative?

4 MS. SNURKOWSKI: I guess part of the source

5 would be the fact that in overcoming the qualifications

6 -- while maybe his pleading may be simple, the notion

7 is that he has to overcome those things that may have

8 happened in the past. For example, in this particular

9 instance, whether in fact there's been any violation as

10 to a -- a res judicata, collateral estoppel --

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: No. But I mean, that's not

12 -- that's not the issue. I'm not asking you about res

13 judicata. I'm saying that if he comes into court and,

14 as Justice Ginsburg suggested in her hypo, his experts

15 demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fact finder that

16 there will, in a certain number of cases, be

17 excruciating pain, and he is at least within the risk

18 of that, your response is we're still -- that is no

19 grounds for enjoining the execution under 1983. We can

20 still execute unless he comes up with a proposal for a

21 less painful way of doing it.

22 And what I want to know is, why does he have

23 such an obligation? Why isn't it enough for him to show

24 that there is a probability that he will suffer

25 excruciating pain?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. SNURKOWSKI: Well, I think for one point,

2 it would be that, in fact, if the State had chosen or

3 selected a method or a change in the modification of

4 the method that was not acceptable to him, then we'd be

5 still back at square zero --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. Justice Souter and

7 Justice Ginsburg can protect their own questions.

8 Part of that allegation in here is that the

9 State wasn't forthcoming with the -- with -- with the

10 information requested, and you're not very forthcoming

11 with the answers. What is the source, what is the

12 legal source, what is the precedent for the proposition

13 that the -- that the condemned man has to come up with

14 an alternative? What case do you cite? What principle

15 do you cite?

16 MS. SNURKOWSKI: The principle I'm --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's what we're asking.

18 MS. SNURKOWSKI: Yes, Your Honor. And I'm

19 sorry that I was in any way disingenuous.

20 But the bottom line is I think that Nelson is

21 the bottom line source of -- of concern that we would

22 bring forth to this Court that if, in fact --

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it was mentioned -- it

24 was mentioned in Nelson. But what would be the reason

25 for -- for elevating that -- that fact in Nelson to a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 requirement? What is the legal principle that would

2 support your argument?

3 MS. SNURKOWSKI: I think the legal principle

4 being that the individual who is coming forth and

5 seeking to have the execution or requesting some relief

6 -- he has to come forward with some evidence, some --

7 some body of law --

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't there evidence in

9 -- I noticed the brief filed by some veterinarians call

10 our attention to the statute that prohibits the

11 euthanasia of dogs and cats unless they follow a

12 certain procedure. So there must have been a

13 legislative feeling that unless that procedure were

14 followed, there's a risk of undue pain to the dogs and

15 cats. Why isn't there a similar basis for believing

16 that if you don't follow a similar procedure that such

17 a risk might be present for human beings?

18 MS. SNURKOWSKI: And that -- that has been an

19 allegation and that has been raised before the courts

20 over the years with regard to that.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: And what's your response to

22 it?

23 MS. SNURKOWSKI: That, in fact, recent --

24 recent development -- and I mean, we're talking about

25 an area that has not -- we have not gotten that far.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 We don't have a record.

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: But your procedure, if I

3 understand it, would be prohibited to be applied to

4 dogs or cats.

5 MS. SNURKOWSKI: But the procedure -- that

6 procedure -- there is -- there is legal information or

7 -- or scientific information out there that -- or --

8 refutes that, and that, in fact, there's a different

9 mechanism and that's --

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, at least it was

11 sufficiently convincing to get the Florida legislature

12 to pass a statute.

13 MS. SNURKOWSKI: That's -- that's correct,

14 with regard to that particular aspect because it was

15 one needle being used and all the drugs were being used

16 in that needle. But that is, again --

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I would have

18 thought your -- your answer to the line of questioning

19 earlier was that the reason that the Petitioner has to

20 come up with this -- an alternative is that otherwise

21 it's plausible, at least, to suspect the reason he's

22 bringing the action is as a challenge to the execution

23 itself rather than the particular method. And that if

24 it's a challenge to the execution itself, it has to be

25 brought under habeas. If it's just a challenge to the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 method, it can be brought under 1983. If he's

2 unwilling to say there is a valid method, then it

3 starts to look like a challenge to the execution that

4 has to be brought under habeas.

5 MS. SNURKOWSKI: And -- and that is the core

6 position the State has taken, and I'm sorry if I did

7 not articulate that in a fashion that --

8 JUSTICE BREYER: But in respect to that core

9 position, I can understand the State's concern with the

10 possibility of abuse. But in Nelson, what the Court

11 says is it points to Gomez, and Gomez was a 1983 case.

12 And there, the Court denied a stay of the execution

13 because it looked into the history of the litigation,

14 and they said that this particular individual had done

15 just what worries you, though in a somewhat different

16 context. He kept bringing the cases, and every time,

17 you know, he'd lose. Then he'd think of another way of

18 making the same point, and in your context, it would be

19 first he challenges this method and he says there are

20 others that are fine. So we go to another. Then he

21 challenges that. Then he challenges that. Then he

22 challenges that, always at the very last minute. So

23 there's a case that provides a weapon if the abuse that

24 you worry about occurs.

25 So why do we need something else like an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 absolute rule of some sort that the Petitioner has to

2 think of a method of execution, a matter on which he is

3 not necessarily expert, that would turn out in the

4 future to be not painful? I mean, you don't need to

5 put on your overcoat and also turn up the heat.

6 MS. SNURKOWSKI: But --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: You've got the case that

8 helps you if that occurs. Why do you need to argue for

9 something else?

10 MS. SNURKOWSKI: Well, and the only reason we're

11 arguing for something else, it seems to me that the

12 basis upon which we are here today is to determine

13 whether 1983 or habeas will lie. And apart from that,

14 I'm trying to make an argument, to the extent I have or

15 not, that -- that this is more in keeping with habeas

16 as opposed to 1983 litigation.

17 Thank you.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

19 Mr. Shanmugam, we'll hear now from you.

20 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

21 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

22 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

23 MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

24 and may it please the Court:

25 Where a prisoner challenges a particular

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 method of execution but fails to identify a permissible

2 alternative, that claim is functionally equivalent to a

3 claim challenging the prisoner's death sentence per se

4 and therefore must be brought --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? Why is that?

6 That -- that -- in which case it would be like -- like

7 Heck. Right? It would come within the Heck

8 principles.

9 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, our view is that the

10 Heck principle is not applicable here where a prisoner

11 is seeking relief that is indisputably available in

12 habeas. Our view is that the governing precedent and

13 really the touchstone here is this Court's decision in

14 Preiser v. Rodriguez, which drew the distinction that

15 the Court has long recognized between claims

16 challenging the conditions of a prisoner's confinement

17 and claims challenging the fact or duration of that

18 confinement.

19 Now, to be sure, that analogy is not exactly

20 apt in the capital context. But we believe that where

21 a prisoner identifies a permissible alternative, it is

22 that which renders the claim --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- well, why? But I

24 mean, suppose he doesn't. Okay? But it's absolutely

25 clear he's not saying all methods are unconstitutional.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 He's saying this method is unconstitutional. If he

2 says this method of constitutional and he wins, then

3 his challenge will not necessarily prevent the State

4 from carrying out its execution. And, of course, I'm

5 reading to you directly from Nelson v. Campbell. That

6 would seem right in point. And why isn't that the end

7 of this case?

8 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we do believe that

9 where a prisoner brings an open-ended claim of the type

10 at issue here, it would necessarily prevent the State

11 from carrying out the execution in one relevant sense.

12 Namely, it would prevent the State from carrying out

13 the execution --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and if I bring a claim

15 that my prison cell is so cold, I actually get

16 pneumonia and die, or near it, and then I challenge the

17 coldness of the cell, I'm preventing my confinement in

18 one particular way.

19 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that's exactly --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: It's a cold cell. And so

21 that would similarly, on your theory, be habeas, but we

22 know it isn't.

23 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, no, I don't think that

24 that's true, and I do think that the --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: My cold cell is habeas?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SHANMUGAM: No. I think that the cold

2 cell case clearly is a conditions of confinement claim.

3 And let me explain to you, Justice Breyer, if

4 I may, the reason that the identification of an

5 alternative is so critical. It is the identification

6 of an alternative that renders the claim the functional

7 equivalent of a conditions of confinement claim because

8 a conditions of confinement claim is really necessarily

9 predicated on the assumption that the prisoner will

10 continue to serve exactly the same sentence, even if

11 the claim is successful. In your hypothetical, if a

12 prisoner claims that his cell is too cold, the

13 necessary implication is that the prisoner will be able

14 to continue to be imprisoned at some higher

15 temperature, even if the prisoner does not specify in

16 his complaint that he wants to be held at 70 degrees or

17 72 degrees. And that is the reason why the

18 identification of the alternative is so important.

19 JUSTICE BREYER: Why more than in Nelson?

20 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, in Nelson, it was

21 important, and we would submit that it was really the

22 dispositive factor in the Court's analysis. The Court

23 noted the fact that the State had conceded -- the

24 prisoner had identified and the State had conceded that

25 an alternative method could be used to administer the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 execution.

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't -- I didn't get

3 your explanation. Had you finished it?

4 MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes.

5 (Laughter.)

6 MR. SHANMUGAM: Let me try -- let me -- let

7 me try again through a different route, though.

8 Where a prisoner fails to identify an

9 alternative, the risk here is that such a claim could

10 delay and may, in fact, prevent the ultimate execution

11 of the death sentence.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the risks that

13 the prisoner will die an excruciating death? I'm

14 asking you the same question that I asked co-counsel.

15 What happens then? He hasn't been able to come up with

16 an alternative, but the judge finds it credible that he

17 may be exposed to an excruciating death. What then?

18 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, in that case, he may

19 very well have a valid Eighth Amendment claim. But our

20 principal submission --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But would --

22 MR. SHANMUGAM: -- is that he cannot proceed

23 in a section 1983 action. Presumably what would happen

24 --

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not? Because he's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 saying I am not asking for this to be one day further

2 along. I'm just asking the State to give me a death

3 that will not require me to suffer excruciating pain.

4 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, again, the concern with

5 the claim that fails to identify a permissible

6 alternative is the risk of seriatim litigation. And I

7 think that the history not only of the Nelson case, but

8 also of some of the ongoing litigation, most notably

9 the Morales case in California, demonstrates that that

10 risk is a very real one. Where a prisoner fails to

11 identify an alternative method, it is not --

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Except -- let me just

13 interrupt. Supposing he did identify, say you can only

14 use pentobarbital on me, the same way they do it for a

15 veterinarian. And the -- and the judge says, well, I

16 don't think that's required. But he would then be

17 satisfied the 1983 requirement?

18 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, the State would at

19 least have the option in that case --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of saying no.

21 MR. SHANMUGAM: -- of acquiescing in the

22 alternative. The State would, of course, have the

23 option of saying no and litigating it.

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: But do you agree if he had

25 said I propose alternative X, even though it's highly

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 unlikely the State will accept it, that would make it a

2 1983 action?

3 MR. SHANMUGAM: That would make it a 1983

4 action. And the critical point, as this Court

5 recognized --

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Even though there's no

7 functional difference in terms of future litigation

8 between that case and this.

9 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, the only reason that

10 there would be no functional difference is if the State

11 chose to, in fact, litigate the issue, notwithstanding

12 his identification of the permissible alternative.

13 And in Nelson --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying -- saying

15 then that the defense bar, the capital punishment bar,

16 and the prisoners are the group of people that have to

17 go and do the research on humane methods of putting

18 people to death rather than the government.

19 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: That strikes me as a little

21 odd, doesn't it?

22 MR. SHANMUGAM: -- I would -- I would

23 respectfully submit, Justice Breyer, that that is

24 exactly the kind of research that they would have to do

25 in order to bring the claim in the first place.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? 


2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think -- I 


3 don't think that's the research they would do. I think

4 the research they would do would be to come up with

5 another method that the State certainly would not find

6 acceptable, thereupon, rendering it a 1983 action and

7 -- and leaving everything in the same status that it's

8 -- that it is here. I mean, I don't see that you've

9 accomplished anything by simply demanding that they --

10 that they come up with an alternative. They're going

11 to come up with a -- with an unacceptable alternative.

12 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, the alternative at a

13 minimum has to be --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it might be

15 malpractice not to come up with -- with an unacceptable

16 alternative.

17 (Laughter.)

18 MR. SHANMUGAM: At a minimum, the alternative

19 has to be one that is permissible under currently

20 governing law.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: Old age. They'll come with

22 that alternative, old age. Right?

23 (Laughter.)

24 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that would not --

25 presumably that would not be a method of execution at

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 all.

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This -- this is a death

3 case. It was not that amusing.

4 Let me ask you this. Doesn't the State have

5 some minimal obligation under the Eighth Amendment to

6 do the necessary research to assure that this is the

7 most humane method possible? Doesn't the State have a

8 minimal obligation on its own to do that?

9 MR. SHANMUGAM: I'm not sure whether it -- it

10 would have an obligation to use the most humane method

11 under the Eighth Amendment because this Court's cases

12 have only suggested that the gratuitous infliction of

13 pain is barred by the Eighth Amendment. I'm not aware

14 of any cases --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I can define

16 gratuitous -- I don't have the dictionary here. But

17 gratuitous means essentially unnecessary. If there

18 were other -- other means, other alternatives, that

19 might be used, it seems to me that the State might have

20 some minimal obligation to investigate those.

21 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think more broadly,

22 Justice Kennedy, that one reason that States do have

23 discretion in this area -- and I think that Florida is

24 not unusual in that regard -- is that prison officials

25 are expected to adopt to evolving methods of execution

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and to take into account changes that might suggest

2 that a particular method is problematic. And so

3 whether or not there is a constitutional obligation, I

4 think that there is every reason to think that States

5 will, in fact, do that.

6 I think that it is noteworthy --

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: But is there -- is there in

8 this case? I mean, the Lancet article has been out

9 there for a while, and it certainly is enough to

10 suggest, in your words, that there is something

11 problematic about the manner in which Florida proposes

12 to do this. And yet, we have not heard a word that

13 Florida has made any effort whatsoever to find an

14 alternative or, for that matter, to -- to disprove what

15 the Lancet article suggests.

16 And so it's one thing for you to say the

17 States have discretion. I don't think that answers

18 Justice Kennedy's question as to why the State does not

19 have an obligation to fulfill its constitutional duty

20 to execute without gratuitous pain. And I don't see

21 why you have given any answer to -- to the proposal

22 that that obligation requires the State to do some

23 investigation of it's own.

24 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, whether or not the

25 State has that obligation -- it may very well have that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 obligation as a constitutional matter, but putting that

2 to one side, it does seem as if the critical question

3 is whether or not the State, in fact, has adopted a

4 method that inflicts cruel and unusual punishment, and

5 where a prisoner has a claim of that variety, a

6 prisoner has other options if the prisoner is unwilling

7 to identify a permissible alternative to bring that

8 claim besides --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: We've -- we've never held

10 that anyway, have we?

11 MR. SHANMUGAM: And the Court has never held

12 that.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: That the State must, in --

14 in imposing the death penalty, use a method that

15 inflicts the least amount of pain.

16 MR. SHANMUGAM: The Court has not held that.

17 Instead, it has --

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And presumably

19 there's some range between most humane and what's cruel

20 and unusual. Right?

21 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that that is

22 presumably true, based on the formulations that this

23 Court has used which have repeatedly focused on the

24 gratuitous or wanton infliction of pain as opposed to

25 the least painful method.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Shanmugam,

2 several of the emergency death proceedings we've had

3 involving this question, the district court judges have

4 assumed that it could proceed under 1983 but then

5 denied relief because it was brought on the eve of

6 execution, as this one was. Is that option available

7 to the district court in this case if it's sent back?

8 MR. SHANMUGAM: It is available to the

9 district court, and indeed, it would potentially be

10 available even to this Court as a matter of first

11 instance as it was in the Gomez case.

12 Thank you.

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

14 Mr. Doss, you have 5 minutes remaining.

15 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF D. TODD DOSS

16 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You know it -- it is true

18 that the 1983 is a civil action, and the plaintiff has

19 the burden of proof, burden of producing evidence.

20 MR. DOSS: That is true. That is true, and

21 we would be prepared to do that if we were allowed to

22 go back and -- and proceed. We have produced evidence

23 at the -- at the pleadings stage, and as we sit here

24 today, since there hasn't been an answered filed, our

25 -- our pleadings are -- are accepted as -- as true for

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- as a matter of procedure.

2 The interesting thing is, is that -- is that

3 Florida created this problem. They can -- they can lay

4 it out as to how to euthanize dogs and cats, but they

5 can't do it for humans. That's perfectly in the open.

6 Yet, they shroud this in secrecy. We can't get public

7 records. We can't -- 3.852(h)(3) of the Florida Code of

8 Criminal Procedure prevents us from going and getting

9 these records before --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think there

11 was adequate time for the district court to fully

12 consider the evidence you intended to present and

13 consider your claim and still proceed with the

14 execution that was scheduled?

15 MR. DOSS: No.

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You filed your case 4

17 days before the execution.

18 MR. DOSS: No, but we were put in that

19 posture by -- by the way the State of Florida has

20 chosen to -- to vest this total discretion, shroud

21 everything in secrecy, and then complain that we didn't

22 bring it earlier when we --

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Sims protocol was

24 there as a matter of public domain. You said in your

25 complaint yourself, when you didn't get any

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 information, you said, well, I assume they're going to

2 follow Sims. Why wasn't that assumption valid 3 months

3 before, 6 months before, or a year before?

4 MR. DOSS: Because at that point, I knew that

5 they had total discretion. I knew that before they had

6 changed their protocols when the electric chair

7 litigation was going on. Indeed, the Florida

8 legislature changed the entire statute when this Court

9 accepted Mr. Bryant's case --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me that

11 you might -- you might have alleged that -- that you've

12 read articles, Lancet articles, and so forth, and that

13 there is a substantial risk that they're going to do

14 this. I think that might suffice.

15 MR. DOSS: That --

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and it would -- it

17 would mean that the -- as the Chief Justice indicates,

18 the court has more time to look at this.

19 MR. DOSS: As far as -- as far as the -- the

20 ripeness issue, it's not -- because of the way Florida

21 chose to do their procedure, it was not ripe, and it

22 doesn't comport with this Court's basic ripeness

23 doctrine that we are going to presume it's going to be

24 done a certain way when the State can come in and say,

25 it's not ripe for review, we -- we still have the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 ability to change this rather than us coming --

2 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose you -- suppose you

3 never were told by Florida what the -- how exactly it

4 was going to be done. Does that mean you never could

5 have brought a 1983 claim even on the day -- the

6 scheduled day of execution?

7 MR. DOSS: If they -- if they never told us,

8 I guess we would be in -- in a position of -- of

9 assuming Sims is in place. But the thing is, is that

10 it's an equitable -- it's an equitable argument. And

11 Florida is not coming forward with clean hands. They

12 created this and then they just want to say, well, you

13 should have known. We're not going to do anything to

14 help you. We're going to shroud this in secrecy and

15 not tell anybody.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose -- suppose they did

17 set it forth but reserved the right to change it. They

18 promulgated a regulation without public notice, without

19 hearings or anything. This is our regulation. This is

20 how we intend to conduct executions in the future.

21 Period. We reserve the right to change this. Would

22 you claim that -- that this was not ripe? You couldn't

23 challenge it at that point --

24 MR. DOSS: At that --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- because they could change

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it?

2 MR. DOSS: If Your Honor -- if Your Honor's

3 fact situation includes a presumption that that's going

4 to be the presumed method, I think at that point, yes --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. This is the current

6 method that we intend to use in all future executions.

7 Period. We may change our mind.

8 MR. DOSS: At that point, yes, because they

9 -- they are stating that they intend upon using that

10 rather --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't -- don't you think you

12 -- you --

13 MR. DOSS: -- rather than playing hide the

14 ball.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- don't you think

16 effectively had that knowledge when you knew -- knew

17 about Sims and you knew about all of the cases after

18 Sims? Is that very much short of -- of their saying

19 this is the -- the procedure we intend to use?

20 MR. DOSS: Absolutely not. We only knew

21 about Sims. We asked for records regarding all the

22 executions since Sims. We have not received it.

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I understand your --

24 your argument to be -- and I don't think you're making

25 it here, but I understood your argument elsewhere to be

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 we knew about Sims, but when they stonewalled us and

2 said we won't tell you what we're going to use, we had

3 reason to question whether they were going to follow

4 Sims. Isn't -- isn't that your point?

5 MR. DOSS: Yes, and that only came into play

6 at the point --

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. You alleged the

8 exact opposite in footnote 3. You said when they

9 stonewalled you, we assumed they were going to follow

10 Sims.

11 MR. DOSS: They stonewalled us only after the

12 warrant was signed because we couldn't do anything at

13 -- at the point before the warrant was signed to be

14 able to try to -- to gather evidence as to what it was

15 going to be. And we were never --

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish.

17 MR. DOSS: -- we were never told that. And

18 because the way Florida has created their system, we

19 were prevented from doing that.

20 Thank you.

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

22 The case is submitted.
