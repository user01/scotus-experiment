1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:06 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument first this morning in Case 132 on our 5 original docket, Alabama v. North Carolina. 6 Mr. Phillips. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS 9 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief 10 Justice, and may it please the Court: 11 North Carolina breached the Southeast 12 Compact in this case. Whether you examine it from 13 the perspective of the sanctions that were imposed by 14 the Commission, or whether you evaluate it from the 15 perspective of the repeated statements by the 16 executives of the Commission that there had been a 17 material breach and a repudiation, or whether you 18 examine it from the perspective of the undisputed 19 record that was collected by the Special Master, the 20 conclusion, it seems to me, is inescapable that what 21 North Carolina did here by taking no action between 22 December 1997 and July of 1996 simply does not 23 fulfill the responsibilities that they had -- that 24 North Carolina had assumed, and therefore the only 25 issue should be: What is the appropriate remedy for
3 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 this extraordinary breach? 2 To go to the specific record, just to be 3 clear about this, the Special Master says at page 10 4 of his report: "The parties do not dispute that 5 North Carolina did not take additional steps to 6 pursue a license for a waste facility during that 7 period." Our undisputed statement of facts is that 8 North Carolina took no further steps to license 9 between 1997 and 1999. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, the point 11 that North Carolina makes is it would be throwing 12 away the taxpayers' money to no purpose. That is, 13 what is the point of continuing to pursue a license 14 when North Carolina does not have the funding to 15 continue the process and to open the disposal 16 facility? 17 So North Carolina's point of view is: What 18 does it mean to continue to seek the license when 19 they are not going to have the money to get to the 20 end of the line? 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, North Carolina 22 assumed the responsibility more than a decade prior 23 to that time to take all appropriate steps in order 24 to provide for licensing and for construction of a 25 facility. "Appropriate steps" in that context has to

1 mean something more than simply doing nothing, 2 declaring categorically that you are going to 3 repudiate the agreement, and attempting to extort 4 from the compact and its Commission additional monies 5 that it is absolutely clear that the Commission has 6 no responsibility to North Carolina to pay. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: But how much -- how much 9 did the Commission give before this? It just did 10 that out of the goodness of its heart? 11 MR. PHILLIPS: No, it did it with -- with 12 the approval of the other States in the compact, for 13 the purpose of promoting the ultimate objective of 14 the -- of the contract -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and I think that 16 one of the best indications of what -- what a 17 contract means is the manner in which the parties act 18 under the contract, and that suggests to me that it 19 was never contemplated that North Carolina alone 20 would foot the bill for -- for obtaining this 21 license. 22 MR. PHILLIPS: The language of the -- of 23 the compact itself, Justice Scalia, is quite plain. 24 It's clear that the Commission has no responsibility 25 to create -- to pay for the creation of this -- of
5 Alderson Reporting Company

1 this facility. That was clear from day one. 2 North Carolina, not only in its legislation 3 authorizing its authority, but also its governor 4 repeatedly saying, we understand that we have a 5 responsibility to create this facility, that -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At what cost? 7 MR. PHILLIPS: At whatever cost -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What the Special Master 9 said was, I believe, that there was never an 10 obligation to do it at all costs. They didn't have 11 to bankrupt their treasury to do this; is that 12 correct? 13 MR. PHILLIPS: Well -14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you accept that as a 15 working proposition? 16 MR. PHILLIPS: I would say that the -- that 17 the State of North Carolina would have -- have a 18 defense of impossibility if they could argue that 19 going down this path would have bankrupted North 20 Carolina. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I think there was 22 certainly a significant amount of evidence that the 23 cost of completing this project was way above any 24 reasonable expectation of the parties at the time of 25 contracting, correct?
6 Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, but the -- but the 2 payment of $80 million by the Commission was way 3 above what any of the parties expected at the 4 beginning of the process as well. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What -- what do you 6 believe the evidence shows with respect to the 7 reasonable cost of completing this project? 8 MR. PHILLIPS: I think it was reasonable to 9 assume that the construction of the facility itself 10 would have cost an additional $75 million. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And about a -- an 12 additional 34,000 to get the license? 13 MR. PHILLIPS: Probably 34 million to 14 complete the license. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So -- I'm sorry. I 16 misspoke. So over $100 million? 17 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but the -- the -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: An amount equal to what 19 they had already -- everybody had already put in? 20 MR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, but the -- but 21 the -22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And about how many 23 times greater than the initial estimates? 24 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know that there were 25 any initial estimates, at least that I recall.

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought it was about 2 20 or 30 million dollars was initially estimated to  3 - to do this project. 4 MR. PHILLIPS: I doubt that that would have 5 included the full construction. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I'm only going 7 through these to try to get a sense from you of at 8 what point did North Carolina have a right to claim 9 impossibility? You are saying that -10 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I mean, I think North 11 Carolina -- first of all, North Carolina never did 12 assert a right of impossibility. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it did by saying, 14 we can't complete this project. 15 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it said it wouldn't 16 complete this project. It imposed upon us and 17 unilaterally imposed upon the other States to the 18 compact the obligation to fund, an obligation none of 19 them had -- had assumed under the contract. 20 To be sure, they had provided moneys to 21 North Carolina with the expectation that North 22 Carolina would use those moneys ultimately to build a 23 project. But the reality is in 1997, in December, 24 North Carolina unilaterally declared that they were 25 not going to complete the project and that they were
8 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 going to take no actions further -- in furtherance -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So your argument is then 3 that they acted 2 years too late. When they gave 4 notice that they were not able to go forward, but 5 they were going to keep this thing going, so if the 6 funds should somehow become available, they would 7 have the -- they would have things still in place. 8 They wouldn't have terminated the effort. 9 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Yes, Justice 10 Ginsburg. Our argument is that -- you know, whether 11 -- you know -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if they had done 13 everything the same -14 MR. PHILLIPS: I think there's an open 15 question of whether the withdrawal in '97 would have 16 been in good faith or not. That would be a separate 17 issue. But there is no question that the one thing 18 that a contracting party does not have the right to 19 do is to unilaterally decide to repudiate the 20 agreement, get the benefit of the agreement -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they told you what  22 - it was totally up-front. They said: Look, we 23 can't go forward with this. We haven't got the 24 money. We'll let everything sit, to see if someone 25 will come up with the money.

1 That's -- it's -- you paint a picture of 2 repudiating the contract, when North Carolina gave 3 notice in '97 that it would have to fold if it didn't 4 get the money. 5 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, and -- and the 6 question then, obviously, that -- the legal issue 7 that that presents is whether or not a party to a 8 contract who is not entitled to expect the other 9 participants to the agreement to pay any more money 10 or in fact any money whatsoever has the authority 11 essentially to attempt to extort that money while 12 continuing to gain the benefits of the contract for 13 an additional year and a half; at that point, then 14 they -- then they withdraw. 15 We can debate about whether the withdrawal 16 was in good faith or not. But the bottom line is 17 there is no substantial difference between the 18 repudiation and the complete disregard of the 19 contractual obligations. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What were the benefits 21 that North Carolina was getting by paying whatever it 22 was -- 400-odd thousand dollars -- to keep it going 23 for another 2 years? 24 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the benefits of being 25 a part of the compact is all of the powers that the
10 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Commission had to deal with other compacts in terms 2 of how to license -- not how to license, but how to 3 dispose of waste. They got all of the benefits of 4 being a part of a compact during the entirety of that 5 period. So, you know, it was not in their interest 6 to repudiate this agreement or to withdraw from it 7 until they got to the point where they were -- where 8 they recognized that they were about to be sanctioned 9 for their failure to comply with their 10 responsibilities. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Were there any benefits to 12 the contract at all until -- unless and until there 13 was a waste facility constructed? 14 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there were huge 15 benefits, Justice Scalia. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: What? 17 MR. PHILLIPS: The Barnwell facility in 18 South Carolina was disposing of waste and was only 19 going to take wastes from the compact States in the 20 Southeast Compact. So North Carolina had -- had 21 ample access to that South Carolina facility that, if 22 it had never joined the compact, it never would have 23 had available to it. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: At what point did South 25 Carolina withdraw?
11 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. PHILLIPS: In 1995, Justice Ginsburg. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so they -- by 1997, 3 they didn't have any access to Barnwell anymore. 4 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but they still had 5 the benefit of the compact's -- the Commission's 6 authority to negotiate on behalf of the member States 7 deals with other compacts for the disposal in those 8 facilities which you otherwise don't have the benefit 9 of. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: It sounds to me pretty 11 hypothetical. And I find it difficult to believe 12 that there is an obligation to commit money and a 13 liability for failure to do so in a compact which 14 says that the State can withdraw at any time. You 15 talk about good faith withdrawal. What would be bad 16 faith withdrawal? North Carolina simply says: It's 17 no longer worth our trouble. 18 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, this would be bad 19 faith withdrawal. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Where the State assumes -22 accepts $80 million, goes down a path, is not 23 entitled to any of that money or to any other money, 24 and then unilaterally withdraws -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did it misspend that
12 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 money? Are you saying the money was misspent? 2 MR. PHILLIPS: That's an open issue at this 3 point. We haven't analyzed that. That's part of 4 what I think what would be involved with the last 5 three counts of the -- of the complaint. We don't 6 know exactly whether that money was properly spent or 7 not. 8 But -- but either way, I think it is 9 important to recognize that, even if it were not, 10 quote "misspent", at the end of the day which entity 11 has the benefit of the $80 million? Is it the six 12 members of the compact today? No. It's North 13 Carolina. 14 If the -- if the Federal Government were to 15 declare tomorrow, in response to some terrorist 16 problem, that on-site storage of low-level nuclear 17 waste is no longer permissible and that those wastes 18 have got to be disposed of somewhere other -- in some 19 other kind of a facility, the State that is -- other 20 than Texas, which is about to start one up, but the 21 State that's clearly in the best position to do that 22 today is North Carolina. Why? Because they have got 23 a $134 million jump on everybody, $80 million the 24 benefit of which was conferred by the Commission and 25 the compact and the sister States that were a part of
13 Alderson Reporting Company

1 -2 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Phillips, I 3 really don't quite understand a part of your 4 argument. I'm not sure what happened to the $80 5 million, and I guess you aren't, either. And if in 6 fact -- and maybe it was -- they had in good faith 7 used that money to try and complete the facility and 8 then decided it's just not worth it, would you still 9 be entitled to get the 80 million back? 10 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I think if -- it would 11 be a tougher case if they had taken the 80 million 12 and come to the conclusion of this and there was a 13 finding by the State authorities that this facility 14 simply cannot be built consistent with health and 15 safety. I think that would be an argument that we 16 are not entitled to the money back. 17 But what I think you are not entitled to 18 do, as North Carolina, is to decide unilaterally that 19 more money should be paid, which is not provided for 20 under the agreement, and insist on that as a 21 condition of fulfilling any of its responsibilities 22 under the agreement. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: What is your position -24 what do you say that the States contemplated 25 regarding the financing of these -- of these
14 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 projects? That the State that was unfortunate enough 2 to be selected as the second State would have to pay 3 the full cost, even if it was $200 million, and then 4 would -- how long would it take for that State to get 5 that money back? Would it have to wait until, you 6 know, 80, 100 years later to get the benefit of some 7 other State having to finance a project? 8 MR. PHILLIPS: No. I mean, well, the 9 working assumption is that the facilities would be in 10 operation for 20 years. And the reality, Justice 11 Alito, is that once you have one of these facilities 12 built, given that there are not very many of them and 13 they are and would be a monopoly within the compact 14 region, you have virtually limited -- unlimited 15 authority to dictate whatever price you want to 16 require for taking on the disposal. And if you look 17 at the sites that exist -- it was true in Barnwell; 18 it's certainly true in Utah and in Washington -- I 19 mean, those are licenses to print money, essentially, 20 at this point. And the expectation -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in -- but in the -22 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- case of this compact 24 and the other ones, as I -- do I understand 25 correctly, Mr. Phillips, that none of these -- none
15 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 of these compacts that were negotiated around the 2 same time, none of them yielded a disposal -- an 3 operative disposal facility? 4 MR. PHILLIPS: None so far. Texas I think 5 is as -- is as far along in its process as -- as 6 anyone, and it's -- and it's part of a compact. But 7 you know, obviously there is a "not in my backyard" 8 mentality here. But the -- at the end of the day, 9 the fundamental question remains, you know, what -10 who bears the responsibility? 11 North Carolina -- it wasn't as though North 12 Carolina was the unfortunate recipient of this 13 particular decision and then said, you know, we don't 14 want to do this, we can't pay for this, there's no 15 way we can accomplish this. North Carolina, after 16 having been designated as the host State, 17 affirmatively passed legislation accepting that 18 responsibility and committing the State to actually 19 providing for a facility. 20 Now, Justice Stevens, I agree, if it had 21 turned out that as a matter of public health and 22 safety -- that's the big bugaboo here -- if that had 23 been an obstacle, or maybe, Justice Sotomayor, if the 24 expense had been so far out of the range of what's 25 conceivable, maybe there's an impossibility element

1 to it. But the -2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I interrupt just 3 a moment? 4 MR. PHILLIPS: Of course. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume they 6 hadn't taken the 80 million. Let's assume they had 7 sunk all of that money themselves -8 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and they looked and 10 said: It's going to take us another 120 million to 11 complete this; we just can't. What in the compact 12 stopped them from withdrawing? Because the only 13 provision I see in the contract about withdrawing is 14 the one that says once the facility is completed -15 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you have to keep -17 you have to give notice, four-year notice. 18 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. The only thing -19 there is nothing express in the contract, in the 20 compact, that would prevent them from doing that. I 21 do think there is an implied duty of good faith. But 22 in the situation you pose, Your Honor, I don't think 23 there's any question that they acted in good faith. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right, okay. So 25 assuming they are acting in good faith, I still don't
17 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 quite understand what the difference is except the 2 fact that they took what you've described in other 3 counts as an unjust enrichment. You got us to give 4 you some money to help you along in this project. 5 But the situation hasn't changed. We can't spend 6 more money. We certainly can't spend the amount of 7 money it will take to complete this project. I'm not 8 sure what turns that into bad faith, other than your 9 claim that they -10 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, other than -- other 11 than the fact that to say "We can't" strikes me as 12 utterly implausible. To say "We don't want to" 13 strikes me as much more arguable. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but the 15 hypothetical I gave you before you described as good 16 faith: Just too much money. 17 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But the problem was 18 -19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What turns it into bad 20 faith? 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the problem -22 what turns it into bad faith is taking the 80 23 million, consistently committing to going forward 24 with it, and then walking away right before you are 25 going to get sanctioned for failure to comply with
18 Alderson Reporting Company

1 the -- with the agreement. I think those are the 2 elements that make it -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any precedent 4 from this Court for reading into a contract between 5 States an obligation of good faith? 6 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't have any -- any 7 decision of this Court. I do have an opinion by the 8 D.C. Circuit some years ago that says that every 9 contract carries with it an implied duty of good 10 faith and fair dealing. You may remember that 11 opinion. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Then how do you -- what is 13 -- is that absolutely necessary? Any party State may 14 withdraw from the compact by enacting a law repealing 15 the compact. That sentence seems to me your toughest 16 point because that's what they did. They simply 17 withdrew. 18 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, where in the contract 20 is it something that says -- I mean, maybe that was 21 foolish, to put that in there, but they did put it 22 in. And so how do you deal with that sentence, which 23 is one that Justice Scalia brought up in his -24 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the only -- the only 25 argument we have with respect to that -- and it's
19 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 important to recognize, we don't have to win this 2 issue in order to win the breach of contract claim in 3 this particular case. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- all right. Well, 5 go ahead, explain. 6 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, because there's 7 massive repudiation long before the -- the question 8 still is, what do you do with 1997 to 1999? Before 9 they withdraw, they have repudiated the agreement. 10 They have breached it totally. The very essence of 11 the agreement was lost once North Carolina refused to 12 take any steps, much less appropriate steps. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there in this implicit 14 that the State of North Carolina, prior to their 15 withdrawal, while they are still acting, will 16 appropriate reasonable amounts of money for this? 17 MR. PHILLIPS: And take -- well, what they 18 are supposed to do is take appropriate steps to 19 license, which means -20 JUSTICE BREYER: Do appropriate steps 21 include -22 MR. PHILLIPS: -- continue to do what's 23 necessary to get a license. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: -- do they -- does this -25 if we have a lend-lease agreement entered into a
20 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 treaty and absolutely ratified, I suppose that if 2 Congress decides not to lend and won't appropriate 3 the money to do it, we are in breach of the treaty. 4 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: And I assume if there is a 6 similar agreement here and North Carolina's 7 legislature doesn't appropriate any money for 8 whatever internal reasons, North Carolina is in 9 breach of the treaty. 10 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Do I understand this 12 correctly? 13 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, that's absolutely 14 right, Justice Breyer. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any authority for 16 the proposition that when a legislature does not 17 appropriate the money that the executive of a State 18 has committed to another State, that State is in 19 breach, irrespective of whose fault it is within the 20 State? 21 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know that there is 22 specific authority for that proposition. But, 23 Justice Breyer, it seems to me what you describe 24 there is exquisitely close to what this -- what this 25 Court resolved in Mobil Oil Exploration, where
21 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Congress passed a statute saying that the 2 administrative side would not be permitted to go 3 forward, and this Court said that action constituted 4 a repudiation of the underlying obligation, even 5 though it was far from clear that there would ever be 6 any exploration or production of oil on this -- on 7 the outer continental shelf sites that were in there. 8 This Court said that when -- that if an 9 obligor will commit a breach that would of itself 10 give the obligee a claim for damages for total 11 breach, so that it so substantially impairs the value 12 of the contract, and the government said it would 13 break or did break an important contractual promise, 14 impairing the value of the contract, then the 15 government must give the companies back the money. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So this case then 17 boils down to, am I correct, in the years prior to 18 their withdrawal, did they take the steps, 19 appropriate steps, that this contract obliges them to 20 make? 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I think that's a fair  22 23 JUSTICE BREYER: And you say they did not? 24 MR. PHILLIPS: But we have other arguments, 25 obviously, but then -- but on the breach --
22 Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE BREYER: But that's -- but if you 2 win on that one, you win. 3 MR. PHILLIPS: -- we should win. In my 4 judgment, that's -- the conduct of North Carolina 5 between 1997 and 1999 is exactly the same conduct 6 that the United States entered into in Mobil 7 Exploration. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: And the state of the 9 finding of the Commission in respect to that precise 10 point, and it's called -- what is it called? The 11 "Impact Commission"? Do we have the same thing in 12 mind, the Commission? Is that what it's called? 13 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, it's a -14 JUSTICE BREYER: They have -- they are the 15 ones who are the judge, it says. 16 MR. PHILLIPS: I believe that they are the 17 sole judge, yes. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. That's what it 19 says. 20 MR. PHILLIPS: Article 7(C). 21 JUSTICE BREYER: The findings in respect to 22 that specific 2-year point are what, and where are 23 they in the record? 24 MR. PHILLIPS: Okay. That's in the -- that 25 will be in the sanctions order that's in the
23 Alderson Reporting Company

1 appendix, so that -- in the record. I think it's 2 around page 400. I will get that for you, Justice 3 Breyer. 4 But the specific finding is that North 5 Carolina had a duty to go forward and -- and stopped 6 completely. It repudiated. 7 In addition to that, when North Carolina 8 announced that it was shutting down the project and 9 that it was not going forward, that it was just going 10 to run out and wait and hope, frankly, that 11 additional funding would come forward, the -- the 12 compact -- the director of the compact specifically 13 wrote to the governor twice, saying: These are acts 14 in repudiation and in violation of the agreement; it 15 is your responsibility. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they also -- you 17 said -- you said in your brief that the -- in 1997, 18 the Commission came forward with some kind of 19 additional funding proposal, which North Carolina 20 came down -- turned down. 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Refused, right. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what was that? 23 MR. PHILLIPS: The basic proposal -- the 24 draft memorandum of understanding would have -- would 25 have led to the Commission providing, I think, about

1 $21 million, and the generators in the Southeast 2 States providing a loan to North Carolina of an 3 additional -- I think it was $13 million. And that 4 gets you the $34 million -- comes from -- for the -5 for the finalized elements of getting a license put 6 in place. So we had -- you know, we thought we had 7 in place an offer to fund. I mean, that's what makes 8 North Carolina -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why did -- why did North 10 Carolina turn it down? 11 MR. PHILLIPS: You might want to ask Mr. 12 Dellinger that question. They didn't -- they didn't 13 provide us with any explanation for why they didn't  14 - why they turned that down. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you say there was a 16 package, that there was a -- an offer in place where 17 the Commission would pay X and the generators would 18 kick in an additional amount as well. 19 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And that would have 20 been a loan for the future. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that was -- that -22 everybody had signed -- everybody who was part of 23 that offer had signed onto it? 24 MR.

PHILLIPS: Well, you know, when you -9 when you've got the power to extort, you know, the 10 temptation to go down that path, Justice Scalia, is 11 obviously pretty strong. And the reason they did it 12 was -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I suggest it's not the 14 power to extort; it's the power to withdraw. And 15 that power to withdraw suggests that there is no 16 absolute obligation to come up with the funding. The 17 two seem to me so -- so inconsistent with -- with one 18 another. 19 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the difficulty -20 JUSTICE SCALIA: So long as you can 21 withdraw at any time -22 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But remember, you 23 are talking now also about the Commission and the 24 other compact States having sunk $80 million in the 25 investment to get this site up and running. So we've

PHILLIPS: Yes, our position would be 5 exactly the same. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So whatever the 7 Commission contributed? In other words, it doesn't 8 have to be enough to trigger an obligation on the 9 part of North Carolina to move forward. I assume 10 there is some level where you would say, you know, 11 they took their chances, and it didn't work out -- as 12 opposed to they obviously committed in light of the 13 money they accepted. 14 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the answer to 15 your question is -- you know, of course, is: What's 16 the appropriate remedy for the particular breach in 17 any given case? In this context, if we were talking 18 about a couple thousand dollars -19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I don't think 20 so. I think it's a question of whether there's a 21 breach. I would say that if you gave them $1 22 million, you should not view that as: Well, we've 23 supported your efforts; you are committed to do this, 24 no matter how much it costs, because we have given 25 you $1 million.

1 It seems to me at some point the amount 2 becomes pertinent in assessing whether you have a 3 claim. 4 MR. PHILLIPS: But I -- well, I think the 5 ultimate question is still: What is the obligation? 6 And Justice Breyer identified it, I think, quite 7 precisely. And again, this is only with respect to 8 count 2 in that breach claim. 9 But our argument there is that they had a 10 responsibility from December 1997 until July of 1999 11 to take appropriate steps. And they massively 12 repudiated that obligation and repudiated the 13 entirety of -14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My -- my problem 15 remains -16 MR. PHILLIPS: -- of the contract. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- with that answer, is 18 that you earlier said that they could -- forgetting 19 if they didn't take any money -- under the terms of 20 this compact -- and Justice Scalia has been noting 21 this repeatedly -- have withdrawn at any time because 22 they didn't want to sink any more money into this 23 project; is that correct? 24 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Subject to what I 25 would think was a duty of good faith, they could have
28 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 done that. But they didn't do that. 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, let's put aside 3 that duty of good faith -4 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because with that 6 duty of good faith, you're suggesting that merely 7 because they took a million -- that's what the Chief 8 Justice is asking you -- or 80 million, that that 9 somehow converted or changed the express terms of the 10 contract and bound them in some way to find funding 11 that they chose not to. That -- that's really the 12 argument I'm hearing you make. 13 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I think it's more subtle 14 than that, Justice Sotomayor. I mean, my point is 15 they always had an obligation to take appropriate 16 steps to get licensed. That was an obligation that 17 lasted until they withdrew. And from -- from 18 December 1997 on, they refused to take any steps 19 toward getting a license. And we don't know today 20 whether something could have happened in that year 21 and a half that might have changed the entire dynamic 22 of this and allowed it to in fact be completed in a 23 way that all of the parties would have been satisfied 24 with. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: May I ask you just one
29 Alderson Reporting Company

1 question on the sovereign immunity issue? 2 MR. PHILLIPS: Of course. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any factual 4 development that needs to occur before the Special 5 Master to address the legal questions that have been 6 presented? And I see the legal questions as whether 7 or not, in fact, the claim belongs to the Commission 8 or to the States for the $80 million and the $10 9 million in lost revenue. 10 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any factual 12 development that needs to occur, or is that a pure 13 legal question based on the arguments that are 14 contained in the briefs before us? 15 MR. PHILLIPS: I think it's a pure legal 16 argument. I think we have put forward everything 17 before the Special Master that we think is relevant 18 for the -- for a disposition of that -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is there in the 20 record that shows that the claims of the States are 21 identical to the claim the Commission is asserting, 22 which was the -- which was the instance in the 23 Arizona-California case? 24 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. The bill of 25 complaint itself doesn't distinguish between claims

1 based on any particular party. They list the parties 2 and they list the claims, and there is no effort to 3 mix and match as between them. In terms -4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that it's 5 the obligation of the Commission to show that there 6 is an absolute parallel between the claims. And I 7 just don't see where I can infer from the record or 8 conclude that that is the case. And if -- and if 9 that is not so, then the Commission is not like the 10 Indian tribes in the Arizona case. 11 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I would think at a 12 minimum we are very much like the private oil 13 companies in the Maryland v. Louisiana case, in any 14 event, where, you know, the claims were out there; it 15 was far from clear exactly how those claims were 16 going to play out in one way or another. And this 17 Court didn't sit down and say: We have to sort that 18 out ahead of going forward with the litigation. What 19 the Court said was: These all look to be pretty 20 close and there's no basis on which to assume that 21 they are doing more -- that they are asking for more, 22 and therefore there's no Eleventh Amendment problem. 23 And, of course, remember the Special Master 24 has held open the possibility that if for some reason 25 the claims of the Commission were to deviate from the
31 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 claims of -- of any of the compact States, which as 2 far as I can tell to this point they have -- they 3 have not deviated one iota, then the Special Master 4 would allow North Carolina to revisit -- to renew its 5 motion at that point. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't there an 7 obligation before we exercise original jurisdiction 8 to ensure that there is at least a potential viable 9 claim by the States that they have a cause of action? 10 I mean, that then becomes a legal question. Is the 11 compact -- is the Commission an agent? 12 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do the States own these 14 revenues? 15 MR.

The 20 question is do they have legitimate claims to what 21 the Commission is seeking. I think that's the 22 question. 23 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And I think the 24 answer to that is -- just as the Special Master said, 25 it's premature to try to judge that until we get to a

1 point in the litigation where it becomes clear that 2 there is some departure between what the States are 3 doing and what the Commission is doing. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I am conscious of 5 your white light, but it does seem to me -6 MR. PHILLIPS: I get -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that the Commission is 8 -- is asking for the money for itself. 9 MR.

I do think it's an easier 13 vehicle for the Court to be able to provide a remedy 14 by giving money under these circumstances. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 16 Phillips. 17 Mr. Kneedler. 18 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 19 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES 20 AS AMICUS CURIAE, 21 IN SUPPORT OF NEITHER PARTY 22 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 23 it please the Court: 24 The United States has participated in this 25 case both, at the Court's invitation, at the motion
34 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 for leave to file stage and then before the Special 2 Master, primarily on the issues that were addressed 3 in the Special Master's preliminary report, which go 4 to questions of the assertion of Eleventh Amendment 5 immunity in original actions as well as the structure 6 of the compact and the compact's power to assess 7 monetary sanctions itself. 8 Today we make two principal arguments: 9 one, that the Court should deny North Carolina's 10 motion to dismiss the Commission as a party, 11 rejecting at this time or for the time being the 12 assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity; and second, 13 that the Court should deny the claim that the 14 Commission has the power itself to impose monetary 15 sanctions under article 7(F). 16 That's not to say that the States party may 17 not seek monetary relief, appropriate monetary 18 relief, themselves in an original action in this 19 Court. It's only to say that the compact Commission 20 is not a forum established by the compact itself, 21 which is not only a compact between the States, but 22 an Act of Congress, to do that. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask you, what is 24 the policy advantage of the rule you are proposing 25 with respect to the first question, the joinder of
35 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the Commission in this original action, of us 2 proceeding to answer substantive questions about the 3 interpretation of the compact, et cetera, without 4 addressing initially the right of the Commission to 5 bring this action as an original action at all? 6 It seems to be putting the cart before the 7 horse, or -- because I'm not sure why we should be 8 reaching the merits, deciding the merits, before 9 identifying which are the parties and what claims 10 they have before us. 11 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I, think, as Mr. 12 Phillips suggested, this Court's decision in -- in 13 the United States v. Georgia establishes the Court is 14 not required to, and in some circumstances it -- it 15 may be possible to dispose of the case on -- on the 16 merits because the plaintiff States in this case I 17 think undoubtedly have a cause -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this one won't. 19 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the plaintiff States 20 undoubtedly have a cause of action for breach of the 21 compact. They are parties to the compact, and as 22 parties to the compact, they can bring an action 23 whether or not the Commission is properly before -24 before the Court. And the question of whether the -25 North Carolina violated the compact therefore can be
36 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 adjudicated solely on the basis of -- of the 2 plaintiff States' claim, without having to reach the 3 question of -- of whether the Commission could 4 properly be made a party. 5 If this Court were to agree with the 6 Special Master that there was no violation of the 7 compact, then the question of whether the Commission 8 could be -- could also bring that claim and what -9 what remedy there might be for that, either to the 10 States or to the Commission, would never have to be  11 - to be reached. So there is, I think, some 12 efficiency with -- with respect to that. 13 But on the Eleventh Amendment question -14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have -- Mr. 15 Kneedler -16 MR. KNEEDLER: I'm sorry. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, do we have 18 any decision that deals with the standing of a 19 commission to sue a State in its own right? Or this 20 is a novel question? 21 MR. KNEEDLER: This is -- this is a novel 22 question as -- as far as I -- as far as I am aware. 23 And -- and that may be one reason why the Court would 24 prefer not to specifically address the question. But 25 I -- but I do think on the -- on the basic principles
37 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 of Eleventh Amendment immunity, that this Court's 2 decision in Arizona v. California, at least at this 3 stage of the case, is dispositive. Because there the 4 Court concluded that the States -- because the United 5 States had intervened, they had no assertion of 6 Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to the 7 subject matter of the dispute. As the Court put it, 8 the tribes are not bringing any new claims or issues 9 before the Court, and therefore the judicial power of 10 this Court would not be enlarged and the State's 11 sovereign immunity would not be compromised by the 12 Indian tribes' participation in the case. 13 We think that's an important principle, at 14 least with respect to Indian tribes, who this Court 15 recognized in Arizona -16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But here the Commission 17 is seeking sums for itself. What assurance do we 18 have that the Commission, if it received the money, 19 would give it back to the States exactly in the ratio 20 the States demand it? 21 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I don't think the 22 Court -23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I think it's their 24 obligation to show the complete parallel between -25 between the claims, and that that has not been done.
38 Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, two things about that. 2 In Maryland v. Louisiana, which was a suit brought by 3 a number of States to challenge a -- a Louisiana tax 4 on Commerce Clause grounds, that case went forward on 5 the suit of the -- of those States, but the natural 6 gas companies who paid the tax were permitted to 7 intervene, and the Court did that, notwithstanding 8 the Eleventh Amendment. Surely, the claim of the 9 States parens patriae was not identical to the claims 10 of the individual natural gas companies to get a 11 refund on their own behalf, but the Court nonetheless 12 allowed them to intervene, and the Court's judgment 13 in this case awarded -- required the State of 14 Louisiana to make refunds to -- to all taxpayers. 15 So I -- I don't think -- especially in an 16 original action where the State has a certain parens 17 patriae responsibility, I don't think that the claims 18 have to be identical in the precise way that they 19 were in -- in Arizona v. California. 20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kneedler, can I ask 21 you sort of a basic question about the Eleventh 22 Amendment argument? You -- you framed it entirely in 23 terms of the Eleventh Amendment, but is there not 24 also a common law immunity that the States can plead 25 against non-sovereigns?
39 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, although I -- I think  2 - I think -- I don't know whether this falls within 3 the precise terms of the Eleventh Amendment. It 4 would depend on whether the compact Commission is 5 regarded as a citizen of another State, which I think 6 it would not be. But, yes, it would be the -- the 7 principle recognized in Alden. But I -- the 8 principles that I am describing here I think would 9 apply equally to that immunity, as they would to the 10 other -11 JUSTICE BREYER: Why is it -- to go back to 12 the word "sanctions," when I read the word 13 "sanctions" in the law, the thing that comes to my 14 mind first and foremost is the money, like a fine; 15 and sort of second, imprisonment. But paying a fine, 16 that -- that seems to me the most primitive and basic 17 sanction of anything. And -- and why -- and 18 particularly, if you say the fine was limited to 19 giving back money you previously took. 20 So, why wouldn't you read this clause here 21 which says "including" -- and then it doesn't mention 22 money, but it includes some other things, and you say 23 well, sure, they include the other things because the 24 word "sanction" doesn't automatically call to mind 25 those other things, but it does automatically call to
40 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 mind a fine. 2 MR. KNEEDLER: There -- there are several 3 points that I think are important to bear in mind 4 with this. I think this Court has always recognized 5 that monetary liability on the part of a State is 6 distinct from prospective relief, and I think the 7 Court should not lightly assume that States have 8 agreed to have a nonjudicial forum, like a -9 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, are we supposed to -10 are we supposed to treat compacts among States as if 11 we are dealing with those who want to impose 12 obligations on the States? 13 MR. KNEEDLER: No, but -14 JUSTICE BREYER: Here, aren't we trying to 15 say what obligations did the States themselves want 16 to impose on themselves? 17 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and as we point out in 18 pages 26 and 27 of our -- of our brief, there were 19 three -- it's actually four compacts that were 20 adopted or approved in the very same Act of Congress 21 which specifically provide for monetary sanctions -22 or monetary -- monetary remedies, which shows that 23 the compacting parties knew how to do it when they 24 wanted to. 25 But beyond that, I think it's important to
41 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 look at the overall structure of article 7, where the 2 sanctions power appears. First of all, article 7(F), 3 which is on page 19a of the blue brief, refers to any 4 party State which fails to comply, et cetera, "may be 5 subject to sanctions, including suspension of rights 6 under the compact and revocation." 7 Those are all forward-looking sanctions. 8 But -- but I think what really reinforces that is if 9 you look at the title of article 7, which is on page 10 17a, it says -- it deals with eligible parties, 11 withdrawal, revocation, entry into force, and 12 termination. Article 7 is all about membership in 13 the -- in the Commission. The Commission's powers, 14 by contrast, are set out in article 4 of the -- of 15 the compact. There are enumerated powers there and, 16 for example, article 4(E)(11), on page 11a -- the 17 only enumerated power with respect to sanctions 18 there, at the bottom of 11a, is to revoke the 19 membership of a party State in accordance with 20 article 7(F). 21 One would think, if there -- if there was 22 an extraordinary power to grant monetary sanctions, 23 that it would have appeared in the enumerated powers, 24 and in fact, in the one compact adopted at the same 25 time that provides for imposition of fines, it
42 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 actually appears in the enumerated powers portion of 2 the relevant compact, not in the membership. 3 And, Justice Breyer, you asked about 4 section -- article 7(C), with respect to the power of 5 the Commission to be the judge of -- of certain 6 matters. I think it's pretty clear that what that's 7 driving at is the Commission being the judge of the 8 qualifications of the -- of the States and the 9 members of the Commission appointed by the States to 10 participate. 11 It's like the power of any legislative 12 body, the power of Congress to determine the 13 qualifications of someone who's about -- who has been 14 voted in, should that person be seated. I think 15 article 7(C) is directed at that, not at some power 16 of -17 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it adds -- it adds  18 - it starts "Qualifications." It says it's the judge 19 of qualification and it's the judge of their 20 compliance with the conditions and requirements of 21 this compact. 22 MR. KNEEDLER: But if you continue -- "And 23 the laws" -24 JUSTICE BREYER: "And the laws of the 25 States relating to the enactment of the compact."

1 MR. KNEEDLER: Right, but -- but -- the -2 the laws of the parties -- if I may finish? 3 "The laws of the parties State," the final 4 phrase relating to the enactment of the compact, I 5 think would modify the qualifications -- compliance 6 with the conditions and requirements of the compact 7 with respect to membership. 8 Again, I think that comes from the first 9 part of article 7(C), but I think it's -- it's the 10 overall thrust of article 7 that it deals with 11 membership. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 13 Kneedler. 14 Mr. Dellinger. 15 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER 16 ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT 17 MR. DELLINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 18 it please the Court: 19 I think I should begin with a simple 20 question that my grandson asked me, which is why did 21 North Carolina quit? Which I think sheds light on 22 what its obligations were and what the understanding 23 was. 24 This is a compact. It is not based upon a 25 coercive model. You could have one, where States --
44 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 all the States are required to remain in the compact, 2 withdrawal is a nullity, the Commission can enforce 3 financial sanctions, and the compact members waive 4 sovereign immunity and can be sued in Federal court. 5 This compact is based on a consensual 6 model, where it -- each -- each State can withdraw, 7 and therefore the compact has to be in the rough 8 financial interest of each of the States at any point 9 in time, which is what -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You took -- you 11 took $80 million, and they got nothing for it. That 12 would be a question your grandson might ask. 13 (Laughter.) 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What did you do 15 with the $80 million? 16 MR. DELLINGER: The $80 million came from  17 - not the State -- the statement that the States gave 18 North Carolina $80 million and North Carolina has 19 kept it and didn't give it back is a shorthand that 20 is misleading in every single respect. 21 The funds, of course, didn't come from the 22 States. They contributed $25,000 apiece. It came 23 from charges on generators from all over the country. 24 The funds went to the authority established under 25 North Carolina law and could only be used for the
45 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 purposes of the Low-Level Waste Authority, and indeed 2 they all were used for the purposes of the Low-Level 3 Waste Authority. 4 The master assumes that -- that all -5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How did that help the 6 other compacting States, giving them the $80 million 7 and North Carolina walking away? 8 MR. DELLINGER: Well, Justice Sotomayor, no 9 one was helped by this process or the process of the 10 other compacts, none of which resulted in a -- in a 11 facility. But what North Carolina did was to carry 12 out its responsibilities to take appropriate steps 13 and, as I will show in a moment, fully in accord with 14 the understanding of the Commission and North 15 Carolina, that they would be -- it would be jointly 16 financed, even though the Commission had no legal 17 obligation. But the key reason -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm hard-pressed to 19 understand where that comes from. Under the terms of 20 the contract -- the compact, the compact expressly 21 says that none of the contracting States have any 22 liabilities with respect to this -23 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct, and it 24 says that the Commission does not have any legal 25 obligation --
46 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly. 2 MR. DELLINGER: -- under the compact to 3 fund it, either. But it was because this is a 4 consensual compact and because of the right to 5 withdrawal, as the master noted, it would have been 6 surprising if a facility were constructed without 7 significant assistance from the States that were not 8 the host State because of the right to withdraw, and 9 that indeed was recognized from the very beginning. 10 For example, in 1996, when the -- the 11 chairman of the Commission was hoping to speed up the 12 completion, the chairman noted that the opening of a 13 new regional facility in North Carolina would ensure 14 a source of revenues for site development in the 15 third host State. 16 Indeed, it's not surprising that, from the 17 beginning of the compact, the Commission provided a 18 substantial amount of the funding because North 19 Carolina could have withdrawn at any point. And the 20 Commission repeatedly recognized that it was, quote, 21 "necessary and appropriate and reasonable and 22 equitable" for the Commission to contribute to this. 23 Mr. Phillips cites the North Carolina 24 legislation -- the North Carolina legislation, which 25 notes that, among the Commission's -- the authority's
47 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 corporate powers, when it sets up the authority or 2 the financing -- but the North Carolina legislation, 3 as the Commission expressly recognized and cited in 4 providing the money, provides that North Carolina may 5 accept funds from its general assembly. The North 6 Carolina authority may accept funds from the North 7 Carolina general assembly, from the Commission 8 compact, from other States, from the Federal 9 Government, or from generators. And they begin to 10 say it's necessary and appropriate. 11 At every step, they -- the Commission says 12 that in -- in February of '88, October of '89, 13 September of '92, November of '92, "reasonable and 14 equitable to provide this funding," and of course it 15 makes sense, given the consensual nature of the 16 compact. 17 So, what happened? Why did North Carolina 18 quit? What happened was, because of the right to 19 withdraw, South Carolina withdrew in 1995. When 20 South Carolina withdrew, this of course deprived the 21 Commission of a ready source of funding from the fees 22 that were being paid to the facility in Barnwell, 23 South Carolina. 24 But much -- or of equal significance is the 25 fact that South Carolina, having withdrawn, no longer
48 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 had to comply with the compact requirement, that 2 South Carolina ceased operating a facility on 3 December 31, 1992. 4 Why was that important? Because the 5 compact creates, as Mr. Phillips noted, something 6 like a monopoly within the region, and when you are 7 financing the facility you know, if you are the 8 financing authority, that you will have a captive 9 market -10 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I see. So -11 MR. DELLINGER: Unless -- unless States can 12 withdraw. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: So I was thinking of this, 14 is: What we have are a group of States, each of whom 15 feels it's necessary to build a cholera plant. And 16 they know that the cholera plant will be hated by 17 everybody in their State, but it's necessary. So 18 they each say: We'll undertake it, okay? But the 19 deal is you do, too. Now, that's their basic deal. 20 I don't know that they ever would have 21 entered into this as part of the basic deal that 22 State A depends for 4 years on State B doing it, but 23 when it's State A's turn, they run away. Well, 24 that's the deal. They can run away. But in 25 addition, take $80 million? Okay. That's where we
49 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 are back with the Chief's question. 2 Now, I don't know whether it is an 3 appropriate step or not an appropriate step to keep 4 the 80 million as well as running away. But it seems 5 to me that we have an arbitrator that was supposed to 6 decide whether it was or whether it wasn't, and they 7 said it was an appropriate step. They foresaw you 8 would take the 80 million, never give it back, at 9 least. 10 But the Commission thinks it isn't. And 11 the arbitrator paid no attention whatsoever to the 12 Commission. And what the Commission says in the 13 language that I quoted is that the Commission is the 14 judge of the members' compliance with the 15 requirements of this contract. So when I read that, 16 I think: Surely, he should have paid some attention 17 to the fact that the Commission thought that what was 18 keeping the 80 million was not an appropriate step. 19 Now, there we are. That's my question. 20 And the only answer I've heard so far is, if I read 21 the rest of the sentence, it talks about laws of 22 States relating to the enactment of this contract -23 compact. And I don't know that you read "enactment" 24 so narrowly to refer to laws that talked about how 25 you adopt it. There might be a whole lot of laws. I

1 guess you pay attention to all of them. So I don't 2 see what the last phrase has to do with it. But 3 anyway, that's my basic question in the case. 4 MR. DELLINGER: All right. I'll -- I'll 5 answer them in reverse order: The keeping the 80 6 million and the Commission's judgment about that. 7 Their argument is either that, you know, the 8 Commission is somehow the sole judge of these issues 9 or that there's some -- that you should treat a State 10 as something like a regulated industry under an 11 agency model. And they -- and they point to 7(C), or 12 at least the part of 7(C) that they leave in their 13 quote, as establishing that. And what I think Mr. 14 Kneedler was attempting to say when his time ran out 15 is that, if you just read 7(C), it's about 16 membership. 17 7(C) is in a five-provision sequence: (A), 18 (B), (C), (D), and (E). (A) lists the initial State 19 members; (B) says how other States can become 20 members; (D) provides that the first three States 21 which enact and pay their fees will bring the compact 22 into existence. And (E) states that members of other 23 compacts are not eligible for membership. 24 Then (C), in the middle, says that each 25 State shall be declared a party State upon payment of
51 Alderson Reporting Company

1 the fees and enactment, and the Commission is the 2 judge of the qualifications of the party States and 3 of its members and their compliance with the 4 conditions and requirements of the compact -- and if 5 I may go "dot, dot, dot" -- relating to the enactment 6 of this compact. 7 Now, that phrase "relating to the 8 enactment" might refer just to the preceding phrase 9 about laws of the party States. But Mr. Kneedler and 10 I both read it more naturally in the context of the 11 Commission as judge, that this is about how you judge 12 who's a member. It is, in that sense, like the House 13 of Representatives provision they quote, except it 14 doesn't say "sole judge." 15 JUSTICE BREYER: So, in your opinion, the 16 Commission is not the judge of anything other than 17 membership? 18 MR. DELLINGER: Not with -19 JUSTICE BREYER: So, therefore, the six 20 pages or so of this compact that has to do with a lot 21 of detailed issues that might appear before the 22 Commission -- it is not the judge of whether there is 23 compliance with those issues -24 MR. DELLINGER: With respect to -- with 25 respect to --
52 Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- because this concerns 2 only membership? 3 MR. DELLINGER: With respect to parties to 4 the compact, the Commission, of course, has to 5 interpret the compact when it engages in its sanction 6 authority. If it's going to sanction a State that is 7 blocking the transmit of other States, it has to 8 interpret what it is applying. 9 I think what the -- counsel is arguing that 10 it was entitled to some special deference, and what 11 the master is saying is: Given the right to 12 withdraw, why should North Carolina -- why should it 13 be allowed any deference over a determination by the 14 State that's not a party to the compact? It was not 15 required to -- not a party to -- at that point, to 16 the compact. 17 Now, I do want to answer your question 18 about North Carolina keeping the money, because this 19 is important. Where -20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Before you get to that -21 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: While we are on 7(C), I'm 23 not clear on how you are reading that last section. 24 Is the last phrase -- "relating to the enactment of 25 this compact" -- is it your position that that phrase
53 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 is joined not only with the immediately preceding 2 words -- "the laws of the party States" relating to 3 the enactment of this compact -- but that it also 4 refers back to compliance with the conditions and 5 requirements of this compact relating to the 6 enactment of this compact? 7 MR. DELLINGER: Yes, I am. And that's not 8 grammatically compelled; it is permitted. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: It certainly isn't 10 grammatically compelled, but does it make any sense? 11 MR. DELLINGER: Yes, it does. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Conditions and 13 requirements relating to the enactment of the 14 compact? 15 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. This is about -- it's 16 not very beautifully done, but it's about the 17 Commission judging who becomes a member. In (A), 18 (B), (C), (D), and (E), and as Mr. Kneedler noted, in 19 the other compacts that were based on a model, this  20 - the seventh article is all about eligibility for 21 membership. The powers and sanctions and parts are 22 elsewhere in the compact. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you relying on the 24 caption to article 7 -- "Eligible Parties; 25 Withdrawal; Revocation; Entry into Force;
54 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Termination"? The caption to article 7? 2 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. And it's -- it's also 3 captions about that subject. 4 But if I may return to the question of 5 who's got the money: The $80 million coming from 6 fees generated by users around the country went 7 through the Commission to the authority. It was set 8 up in a special separate account just for the 9 purposes of the authority. All of the funds were 10 expended over this process of a massive amount of 11 studies that were done. Not a penny of it could ever 12 be spent by the North Carolina General Assembly for 13 any purposes whatsoever. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dellinger, what of  15 - what of Mr. Phillips's argument that that $80 16 million gave North Carolina a leg up, should there 17 ever be any revival of the development of a disposal 18 facility; North Carolina is much better situated than 19 anyone else to do this, because they have already 20 sunk $80,000 into pursuing a license? 21 MR. DELLINGER: Well, it has been 10 or 12 22 years since this occurred, Justice Ginsburg, and 23 there has been no effort and no plan in North 24 Carolina to build a facility, and to begin the 25 licensing process anew. Some of the information they
55 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 -- the authority retained, which would be of use to 2 the Commission anywhere, whether there is any site 3 specific information that would still be good 15 or 4 20 years out, I think is just pure speculation. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Take a hypothetical case 6 where North Carolina did have a real advantage and 7 they used the money to create a facility, would that 8 bear on the unjust enrichment claim or even the 9 sanctions claim? 10 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. It might well bear on 11 the unjust enrichment, if there was, you know, an 12 enrichment. What happened here is that the North 13 Carolina General Assembly appropriated money that 14 went to the authority. Properly considered, North 15 Carolina -- the Commission provided money to the 16 authority. The North Carolina General Assembly 17 provided money for the authority. All the funds were 18 spent. The only State that contributed money to this 19 process was North Carolina, and North Carolina 20 contributed $34 million. 21 Now, why did they -- I think one of the 22 most useful documents we have is in the -23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want -- you said 24 the only State that contributed money to the 25 Commission was North Carolina? I just want to make
56 Alderson Reporting Company

1 sure I heard that right. 2 MR. DELLINGER: Every State contributed 3 $25,000 -4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's it? 5 MR. DELLINGER: -- to sign up. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. 7 MR. DELLINGER: But aside from that, North 8 Carolina General Assembly appropriated $34 million to 9 the North Carolina authority, the -- the waste 10 disposal authority. They were the only State to do 11 so. 12 So 80 million had come from the fees 13 generated at Barnwell, 34 million from North 14 Carolina, and the -- what happened was -- once South 15 Carolina withdrew from the compact, was liberated 16 from this obligation to close, was announcing that it 17 was now going to continue and is open to the world, 18 they had a cost advantage and a location advantage 19 over North Carolina. 20 So in -- in 1996, the joint supplemental 21 fact brief at -- appendix at page 143, is where the 22 head of the North Carolina authority writes to the 23 head of the Commission and notes that, with the 24 withdrawal of South Carolina and their decision to 25 continue the operation at Barnwell, the financing
57 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 options have been substantially changed. 2 Under the current compact, any State can 3 withdraw up until the North Carolina facility becomes 4 operational. With an available alternative disposal 5 facility now in South Carolina, there is no assurance 6 to potential bondholders or financiers that there 7 will be a revenue stream from which to repay any 8 indebtedness. Therefore, the authority is in a 9 position where the intended vehicles for financing 10 are no longer possible. 11 One possibility is to modify the compact to 12 preclude withdrawal from the compact, once the 13 license is issued for the North Carolina facility, 14 and that would -- such an amendment would allow -15 future use of the facility would be assured, and 16 revenue financing could be considered. 17 It was not practical to submit that to all 18 seven of the other -- all seven legislatures and to 19 Congress, but the other problem is it would not have 20 -- its -- its passage would, by no means, have been 21 assured. The States, at that moment, could either 22 stay in or go. 23 So North Carolina is faced, after South 24 Carolina's withdrawal, with the prospect of advancing 25 -- trying to advance bonds for another, at minimum,
58 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 $75 million for construction costs, which would bring 2 the whole project up to 223 million, close to a 3 quarter of a billion dollars, and with now a South 4 Carolina facility that is closer to every State in 5 the compact, except Virginia, and where, because it 6 was built in 1981, it has a competitive cost 7 advantage. 8 So why is Georgia going to stay in the 9 compact, when it has what may be a -- a less costly 10 and less distant alternative in going to Barnwell, 11 South Carolina? 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why -- why would 13 anyone stay in the contract? I take it that your 14 point, which is an awfully good one, is that this 15 compact was designed, like others, to solve a 16 political problem. 17 It's necessary for the country to store 18 low-level radioactive waste, necessary for health and 19 safety, but because of the politics and people's 20 understanding, incomplete, no one wants it, and so, 21 now, the States have formed a series of compacts. 22 And we are told, in an amicus brief, that, 23 if this compact is interpreted to allow one State to 24 take advantage of another State's having done so for 25 years and then run away and keep $80 million to boot,
59 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 it will be impossible for many other States to resist 2 that same route. 3 And that will be the end of compacts 4 through the United States, and what we will have is 5 low-level waste without storage. That's argument, 6 roughly, that's made in an amicus brief in this case, 7 and I would like to know your opinion. 8 MR. DELLINGER: My response to that is that 9 the amicus' suggestion that a decision for North 10 Carolina would impair the very useful mechanism of 11 interstate compacts has it exactly backwards. 12 States establishing compacts remain 13 entirely free to include or add provisions limiting 14 the right to withdraw; permitting the imposition of 15 sanctions, including financial sanctions; imposing 16 those on States that are no longer members; defining 17 whether the limits will be a million dollars or a 18 hundred million for what they will impose -- or no 19 limits at all; and, as the Central Compact did, 20 requiring a waiver of sovereign immunity so that 21 these judgments can be enforced in Federal court. 22 All that's possible. 23 But a decision in -- whether or not you 24 decide for North Carolina, if that's what you want in 25 a compact, you can have that compact, and nothing in
60 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 a decision for North Carolina would change that. 2 A decision in favor of North Carolina 3 would, in fact, benefit the compacting process 4 because it would provide assurances to State 5 legislators that you can pick up a copy of the 6 proposed compact and read it and know that that is 7 the extent of the liabilities to which you are 8 imposing your -- exposing your State, and that is the 9 limit of the obligations you are taking on to -10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In this case -- in this 11 case, how did it come about that the right to 12 withdraw any time until the second plant was 13 operable, was that -- that was North Carolina's 14 proposal after it was designated to be the site? 15 MR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, the 16 original compact had no limits whatsoever on 17 withdrawal, and when North Carolina was chosen as the 18 site, it proposed, as a necessary condition to its 19 not -- not withdrawing, that the compact be admitted 20 to add a provision, 7(H), which would say that after 21 -- 30 days after the second facility becomes 22 operational, no State may withdraw without the 23 consent of all the other States. 24 So North -- North Carolina added a 25 limitation on the -- at their behest, a limitation on
61 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the right to withdraw. When South Carolina pulled 2 out, it was clear that that limitation on the right 3 to withdrawal wasn't good enough because it meant 4 that States could withdraw at any time up until the 5 new facility became operational, in which case it was 6 going to be too late. 7 If they pulled out then and went to -- to 8 Barnwell, that made it unbondable because there's no 9 guarantee -- what made it possible to contemplate 10 financing this by bonds and by other financing 11 mechanisms was the insurance of a market and the 12 right to withdraw -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why didn't you 14 withdraw? I mean, all this is very good. You had 15 that absolute right to withdraw, but you didn't 16 withdraw in -- when was it -- '97. You went on for 2 17 years, still as a member of the compact and still 18 subject to obligations under the compact. How could 19 it be said that you were taking all appropriate 20 steps? What is the language -- all -21 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. Appropriate steps -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 23 MR.

1 You took zero steps. 2 MR. DELLINGER: North -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't you withdraw? 4 MR. DELLINGER: Because North Carolina 5 hoped that -- and no longer spending 2 million a 6 year, it spent half a million to get -- to keep the 7 authority going, North Carolina kept open the 8 possibility that there would be some possible 9 financing that might allow this project to be 10 completed. 11 They did not, as Mr. Phillips suggested, I 12 think in error -- they did not have access by staying 13 in the compact to the facility at Barnwell, South 14 Carolina. South Carolina was -- would close that to 15 North Carolina, so -- so -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: They had no benefit from 17 the compact for those 2 years? 18 MR. DELLINGER: But the steps North 19 Carolina took for those last 19 months were exactly 20 the steps that were appropriate. Because they did 21 not have an obligation to fund this at whatever cost 22 and because they were willing -- North Carolina's 23 willingness to continue the same ratio of funding 24 that had been a part of the process for the preceding 25 8 years was not going to provide the sums necessary

1 to complete it, it would have been a waste and a 2 squandering of the money of North Carolina's 3 taxpayers and the Commission to take any steps that 4 required the expenditure -5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you are not arguing 7 impossibility, though. I mean, the other side -8 MR. DELLINGER: No, Justice Scalia. I'm 9 not arguing that it's impossible. What -- what I'm 10 arguing is that, if North Carolina had continued the 11 level of funding, about $3 million a year, on -- on 12 average, North Carolina had been contributing; the 13 Commission, an average of $7 million had been -- if 14 North Carolina had contributed that and some -- it 15 would not have come close -- after the withdrawal of 16 South Carolina, it would not have come close to 17 providing the funds needed to complete the facility. 18 Therefore, any funds expended would have 19 been wasteful and inappropriate. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dellinger, your 21 brief makes -- I think the reply brief made some 22 reference to North Carolina's attempting to get 23 funding from another source after Barnwell -- the 24 revenues from Barnwell were no longer available to 25 it.
64 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 I think, in -- in your reply brief, you 2 make some reference to an effort on North Carolina's 3 part to get -- what -- what was that effort? 4 MR. DELLINGER: Well, the document I cited, 5 December 13, '96, begins to set out some of the 6 proposals. One proposal, for example, was to ask 7 generators -- major generators to take an equity 8 position in the authority, that the North Carolina 9 General Assembly would continue its funding at the 10 same rate it had. Till the last day, North Carolina 11 was willing to spend at that rate. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: But what -- what -- you 13 just said -- I may not have misunderstood, but I 14 thought you said, in response to Justice Scalia, 15 that, during 1997 and '98, when he said why didn't 16 you take appropriate steps, that you said you didn't 17 do anything, and that was the appropriate step; is 18 that right? If you -- if you said that -19 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: If I heard you correctly. 21 All right. But then it shows in the -- in the 22 Special Master's report that, during that time, you 23 received from the Commission funds over $7 million. 24 So you may not have done anything, but you did take 25 $7 million at that time from other people. And so
65 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 they are saying, fine, if you didn't take any 2 anything, didn't do anything, and that was the 3 appropriate step, why isn't it the appropriate step 4 now to give us the 7 million back? 5 MR. DELLINGER: Justice Breyer, there is a 6 -- I -- there is a disconnect between when funds are 7 expended and when they are paid into. There is some 8 deficit financing, so that the Commission's payment 9 in 1998 would have been to provide for expenditures 10 that occurred earlier. So there was no -- there was 11 -- and there's no suggestion that there is any money 12 left over. And -- and, how can I put it? North 13 Carolina doesn't -- never had that money. It went to 14 the authority in a separate and dedicated fund that 15 could only be used for the authority's purposes. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did North Carolina 17 continue to fund the authority during this interim 18 period? 19 MR. DELLINGER: Yes, North Carolina spent 20 half a million dollars a year to fund the authority 21 for the remaining 19 months. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it didn't do nothing 23 during this period? 24 MR. DELLINGER: That's correct. And let me 25 read you --
66 Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE BREYER: You say -- well -- in 2 other words, North Carolina's money in '97 and '98, 3 which was $4 million, went to pay for current 4 expenditures during North -- during that year, 5 '97/'98, but the Commission's money, which amounted 6 to $7 million in that time, was not spent on current 7 things? It was rather a payment for things done in 8 the past? 9 This sounds not -- I'm not -- I mean, 10 that's possible, but I just don't recall anything 11 that suggests that. 12 MR. DELLINGER: North Carolina's 2 million 13 also would have been paid for past -- there was not 14 $2 million spent on activities in 1998. That's -15 that's the payment of prior bills.

1 MR. DELLINGER: Yes, they do. That's -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: So somebody has to be 3 keeping the authority alive, right? Who did that? 4 MR. DELLINGER: The admission of -- the 5 authority with funds from -- that had come from the 6 Commission and from the North Carolina General 7 Assembly. Here's the actual -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- wait, wait, wait. 9 You said all the Commission funds were for prior 10 expenditures. 11 MR. DELLINGER: Well, not necessarily. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. 13 MR. DELLINGER: That is to say -- there was 14 not $6 million expended during that period. There's 15 not an exact match-up between that list of when 16 payments were made and when expenditures were made. 17 But the record showed that North Carolina spent about 18 -- I believe about -- the authority spent about half 19 a million dollars those last 19 months. 20 Now, here's the -- here's the actual 21 admission that North Carolina, quote, "did nothing." 22 Paragraph -- this is at the Plaintiffs' appendix 460. 23 The admission request was: Admit that North Carolina 24 took no further steps after December 19th to ensure 25 that an application for a license was filed.

1 Response: It is admitted that the 2 authority was deprived of funding upon notification 3 from the Commission in or around 1997 that the 4 Commission was terminating its transmittal to the 5 authority of portions of funds derived from fees and 6 surcharges imposed on generators. It is further 7 admitted that the authority had justifiably relied -8 the North Carolina authority -- on the continued 9 provision of these funds in light of the Commission's 10 previous words and actions. For this reason, the 11 authority did not thereafter take -- thereafter take 12 additional steps to site -13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the offer -14 what about the offer that Mr. Phillips brought up, 15 said Commission was ready to pay another $21 million, 16 and there was going to be loans from the generators? 17 MR. DELLINGER: That proposal, first of 18 all, left a significant shortfall, as the master 19 found. Even with that proposal, which North Carolina 20 thought there were some legal problems with whether 21 it would be -- that loans from private generators 22 would allow bonding of the remaining financing -- the 23 master says it was still a substantial gap left, even 24 if North Carolina continued to pay the same amount of 25 money.
69 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 So, with North Carolina willing to continue 2 to pay at the same rate it had for the previous 8 3 years, and the Commission unwilling or unable to do 4 so, it meant that that level of expenditure by North 5 Carolina would be a worthless expenditure of its 6 taxpayers' money and the Commission's money. 7 The Commission's position seems to be that 8 they should have taken steps just for the sake of 9 taking steps, like building half a bridge to nowhere, 10 when you know that there's no financing in sight. 11 They could have withdrawn on December 19th, and they 12 took exactly the steps that were appropriate, which 13 is not to spend money that is futile and wasteful. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask you a 15 question? Is all of this money that has been spent 16 or was spent up until 1999 -- has it been washed 17 away? Meaning -- and this may be what remains for 18 the unjust enrichment claims, but is there any value 19 left to what occurred? 20 MR. DELLINGER: I don't know that there is, 21 Justice Sotomayor.

1 -- in that sense. The -- of the quasi-contract 2 claims. 3 Could I turn, if I could, to the 4 participation of the Commission, which we think 5 raises a -- a substantial constitutional question? 6 This is actually, and should be, a very 7 simple question. States, either at common law or 8 constitutionally -- for these purposes, it doesn't 9 matter which side of the fence you are on in Alden. 10 States have a right not to be subject to suit by 11 parties that aren't the United States or a sister 12 State, absent a valid abrogation. 13 The Commission is neither. It's not a 14 State, and that should be pure and simply the answer 15 to the question. The issues are whether somehow 16 there should be an exception for a compact. It 17 should be treated like a State and allowed to sue; 18 or, even if it's treated like any other private 19 litigant, there is some kind of same-claims exception 20 -- in fact, there is one case, Arizona, only, which 21 really addresses this point -- there should be a 22 same-claims exception. 23 First of all, with respect to whether the 24 compact ought to be able to sue as if it were a 25 State, I think that's resolved -- and this Court,

1 when it rejected a compact suit in number 131 -- of  2 - the Commission suit, might have thought the same -3 by the Hess case. It says that compacts cannot claim 4 sovereign immunity. If they don't have the dignity 5 or status to claim sovereign immunity, they surely 6 ought not be able to affirmatively pierce the 7 sovereign immunity of something that is undoubtedly a 8 State. They are not -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was in -- Hess 10 came up in a different posture. It wasn't -- I think 11 -- it was an attempt to sue the authority, wasn't it? 12 MR. DELLINGER: That is -- that is correct. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So I don't think that 14 they are at all comparable. This is a case of does 15 the -- does the authority have standing or -- to 16 bring the claim. 17 MR. DELLINGER: You could distinguish them 18 -- but -- distinguish the two situations. But that 19 would cut in favor of this situation. You might 20 think that a compact has the right to sue as if it 21 were a State, another State, a State, and still think 22 that -- you might think it had sovereign immunity, 23 but not that it could bring a suit against a State. 24 But you certainly wouldn't think that if it's not 25 even entitled to invoke sovereign immunity on its own

1 behalf, that it ought to be able to bring it. 2 But no matter. There's no good argument. 3 With or without Hess, there is no good argument for 4 treating a compact as if it were a State. That is a 5 slippery road -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- why not? I mean, 7 if it's totally a creature of States -- that's all 8 it's -- there's no other shareholders, nobody in the 9 picture, just -- they are all States that create it? 10 MR.

For 17 example, the representatives from Georgia and 18 Mississippi on the Commission voted to bring this 19 litigation against North Carolina. The States of 20 Georgia and Mississippi did not decide to join. They 21 -- they voted differently from where their States 22 are. 23 And -- and one of the things about the -24 the Commission doesn't have the same constraints that 25 a State has. The attorney general of Alabama might

Something that's not a State doesn't have 5 those constraints. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose we 7 think that the same State -- or the same-claim rule 8 applies, and that if the Commission is asserting the 9 same claim as the State, that then it can sue. 10 Suppose that's the rule. Are these the same claims? 11 MR. DELLINGER: They are -- first of all, 12 they are not the same claims. The States who gave 13 $25,000 are trying to claim that the Commission 14 either is their agent or that they can bring a suit 15 that restitution ought to be made to the Commission, 16 that is a -- the short answer is those are different 17 routes. They are not the same claims, but -18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How can -- how could 19 they not be, Mr. Dellinger? There's only one 20 complaint, and that complaint is on behalf of all the 21 Plaintiffs, not -22 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. But you would have 23 the same last line of a complaint if 1 million people 24 joined the State who brought an antitrust suit 25 against another State. It is simply that -- award

1 the Plaintiffs such damages as this Court deems just 2 and proper. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's no discrete 4 claim made by the Commission as distinguished from 5 South Carolina. 6 MR. DELLINGER: Yes, the Commission is 7 making a straight-up restitution claim, which, as the 8 -- the entity that provided the funds, it does not. 9 But let me say why I think the separate and 10 -- even if the claims were identical, we don't know, 11 at this point, that they will wind up being 12 identical, and States shouldn't have to litigate 13 until we find out. 14 The master just says it's not necessarily 15 the case that they will wind up being identical. Mr. 16 Phillips says -- counsel for the Plaintiffs said they 17 would not concede that they would not, at the end of 18 the day, forgo any claim on behalf of the -- of the 19 States that the Commission didn't have. 20 But, most importantly, there is Alden. 21 Alden makes this a civil case because Alden says that 22 private suits against non-consenting States present 23 the indignity of subjecting a State to the coercive 24 processes of judicial tribunals. 25 If you allow another party in that's not a
75 Alderson Reporting Company

1 State, you are subjecting a State to all of the 2 discovery, all of the different theories, all of the 3 depositions, all of the document requests. A sister 4 State may, in its attorney general's office, think 5 twice about doing that. A private litigant will not. 6 So I think this case is that -- I believe 7 if you didn't want to overrule Arizona, you could say 8 it's a case where the United States brought a case in 9 its role as trustee for the Indian tribes and the 10 tribes themselves were allowed to intervene, and they 11 were, therefore, virtually one and the same party. 12 And you wouldn't need to overrule it. I don't think, 13 if it stands for any broader principle, it can 14 survive Alden v. Maine. 15 Now, if the Commission is out, then we 16 think there is -- and if you agree that there was no 17 breach of contract, then I think the Court should 18 direct the dismissal of the quasi-contract claims 19 because only the States will be left as a party. 20 And those claims -- quasi-contract claims 21 of restitution, it's -- they are claims that are 22 governed by the subject matter of the compact between 23 the States, and as to parties to the compact, there 24 can't be any such claims, and I think that should be 25 the end of it.

1 Thank you. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 3 Dellinger. 4 Mr. Phillips, have you 10 minutes. 5 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS 6 ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS 7 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief 8 Justice. 9 I would like to respond to a number of the 10 points that have been made. It seems to me the most 11 fundamental one that Mr. Dellinger relies upon is the 12 notion that this $80 million was not the money of the 13 compact States, and he -- he keeps saying that 14 repeatedly -- you know, based solely on the fact that 15 the money doesn't come through the treasury of the 16 States. 17 But he ignores, on 12A, article 4(H)(2)(b), 18 which says, with respect to the levying of the 19 special fees or surcharges, which was the basis upon 20 which the entirety of the $80 million comes, that 21 this must represent the financial commitments of all 22 party States to the Commission. 23 It was the understanding that, in 24 exercising the authority to levy these amounts of 25 money in order to generate this, that that was the
77 Alderson Reporting Company

1 States' money, all of the States' money, and 2 ultimately, if this Court would have determined that 3 the money -4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That provision just 5 says the States don't have to give anything more than 6 that, that that's what satisfies whatever obligations 7 they may or may have. But where does it say that 8 money belongs to them? 9 MR. PHILLIPS: It says each State hosting  10 - you know, "shall annually levy surcharges." The 11 total of those surcharges represent the financial 12 commitments of all of the party States to the 13 Commission. That seems to me to say that it is the 14 commitment of the party States that's -- that's being 15 provided for in that context. 16 It's not the money of the Commission. It's 17 not the money of the generators. It's the money of 18 the compact States that's being used for whatever 19 purpose is necessary in order to fulfill the overall 20 objectives of the compact. In this context, it was 21 used to ask North Carolina to go forward to site a 22 facility. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. I don't -- I don't 24 understand that. 25 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: It never passes through 2 the States, and this provision just waves a magic 3 wand and says that it represents the financial 4 commitments of all party States to the Commission. 5 What proportion from each State? Do we know? 6 MR. PHILLIPS: We don't know, and we 7 wouldn't -- and the truth is, at the end -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think all this means is 9 that that is the only financial commitment that the 10 States are obliged to -- to make. 11 MR. PHILLIPS: I think there's no question 12 that it -- that it can be read as -- as saying that, 13 which, of course, then tells you, if it's not the 14 Commission's responsibility and it's not the States' 15 responsibility, then it was clearly, from the outset 16 and has always been, North Carolina's. 17 But I think it goes beyond that, Justice 18 Scalia. I think it actually tells you, as an 19 agreement among all of the party States to this 20 compact, that this is the money of the States, and 21 ultimately -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: It can't be the money of 23 the States if you can't say how much of it belongs to 24 each State. 25 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, no. You --

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: That just doesn't make any 2 sense. 3 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there would be a way 4 to allocate it. It seems to me that maybe -- that 5 either the Commission, based on the vote of the 6 parties -- the party States, could either allocate it 7 back on a pro rata basis, or they can do it on the 8 basis of the percentage of the -- of the waste that 9 was used in any particular fund. 10 There's no specific provision on that, but 11 it seems to me that doesn't detract, Justice Scalia, 12 from the fundamental point that what the compact 13 members agreed upon was that this money would be the 14 money of all of the States. And, therefore, we can't 15 keep it as a Commission. 16 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the money that's -17 but the money that is talked about in that section, 18 as I read it, that's money that would be generated 19 after the facility was completed. 20 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, South Carolina, in 21 this particular context. The -- immediately, it 22 would be South Carolina, and ultimately, then -23 assuming North Carolina or another State were to site 24 a facility, then, from there on, that money would 25 continue to be their commitment.

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: So you're saying the 2 money generated by the South Carolina facility was 3 the money of the compact members? 4 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. 5 JUSTICE STEVENS: And that was the money 6 that was given to North Carolina? 7 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, because the compact 8 agreed among themselves, as part of this agreement, 9 that the -- that they would have authority to impose 10 those surcharges on the generators, as they brought 11 the money in. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then -- but 13 those States couldn't take the money. They couldn't 14 say, I want my share? 15 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think they could 16 have, actually. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are saying it 18 was their money, but they had no access to it. 19 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, but I -- through 20 their membership, they certainly did. If the States 21 agreed to disband the compact and the -- the 22 Commission disappears and there's $80 million in the 23 pot, that money's going somewhere. It's not staying 24 in -- it may get paid for legal fees, but other than 25 that --

PHILLIPS: Right. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: And they go to a booth, 7 and now they are charged something. And is the fee 8 and special surcharge, which this refers to, the 9 total charge? 10 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Total charge. And what 12 does that amount to, primarily? Do we have any idea 13 on a typical -14 MR. PHILLIPS: You mean, in terms as a 15 percentage off the -- off the normal charges? 16 JUSTICE BREYER: No -- well, I don't know 17 how they did it. But, anyway, there's a charge. Say 18 it's $1,000, or maybe it's $10,000. 19 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, that would be a bit 20 high. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so the truck company 22 has to pay $10,000 to the authority. 23 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, the generator does. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: And they are saying here 25 that that $10,000 represents --
82 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. PHILLIPS: Represents the commitment of 2 the States. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: -- the financial 4 commitment of all party States to the Commission. 5 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And all that's 6 saying is that that money, even though that -- I 7 mean, the alternative way to do it, obviously -8 JUSTICE BREYER: That money might -- seems 9 to come from a private company. 10 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: It comes from a private 12 company. It goes to the -- it goes to the Commission 13 -- it goes to South Carolina -14 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, and then it comes to 15 the Commission -16 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and they give it to the 17 Commission. 18 MR. PHILLIPS: -- and the Commission then 19 used it in this context. But that's the basic point, 20 Justice Breyer. If they didn't have this provision, 21 you would -- you might assume it was the generators' 22 money or somebody else's money. 23 The whole point of this provision was to 24 say these moneys, which can only be levied because of 25 the compact and the Commission's authority, remain
83 Alderson Reporting Company

1 the responsibility of the States and, ultimately, to 2 my mind at least, would clearly go back to them. 3 Justice Breyer, I wanted to answer your 4 question with respect to findings of breach. January 5 '98, there is -- the joint supplemental appendix, 6 page 55, makes the -- is the Commission sanction 7 order, and April '99 -- and, again, at appendix 323 8 and appendix 412 -- those are specific findings by 9 the Commission that there have been breaches. 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I just understand 11 -- and I don't know if I am missing something -- your 12 theory that this belongs to the States relies 13 exclusively on either an agency or an ownership 14 theory as alternatives? 15 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean -16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's nothing else 17 that would make it -18 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm relying on this 19 provision of the compact that says it is the -20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -- that's -- if 21 we disagree with that -22 MR. PHILLIPS: Then we have an agency 23 theory as well. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And then we 25 have to address that. Is there any other theory that
84 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 would give the States the right to make the claims 2 the Commission is making? 3 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, yes -4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: For the return of the 5 $80 million. 6 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I think that the Court 7 -- yes, I think the Court would still have the 8 authority, even in dealing with what is the 9 appropriate rule of restitution, because we are too 10 far away from that at this stage. We're not -- we're 11 not there. 12 But I think, if the Court finds that North 13 Carolina breached the compact, it ought to try to 14 find a reasonable way to remedy that particular 15 problem, even if the technical standards didn't 16 apply. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we don't do that, 18 what are you left with? 19 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, Justice Sotomayor, 20 you do do that. I mean, when the Court in Kansas v. 21 Colorado was trying -22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I already posed a 23 hypothetical. Don't -- if we don't, what is left of 24 this case? 25 MR. PHILLIPS: It seems to me the Court
85 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 still has the authority, in deciding what is the 2 appropriate standard of restitution in a problem as 3 unique as this one, to do what it did in Kansas v. 4 Colorado, which is to say: How do we measure the 5 damages to this party? Let's look at what the injury 6 was to the farmers who were completely unrelated to 7 it. They clearly wouldn't -- they weren't parties to 8 that litigation, and the Court said that's a 9 perfectly legitimate way to figure out the right 10 damages. So I think we would still have an argument 11 that you -- that the Court would have the authority 12 to grant that form of restitution under these 13 circumstances. 14 Mr. Dellinger spent a lot of time on what 15 strikes me as sort of a complete fantasy with respect 16 to the funding situation that North Carolina faced. 17 You know, once South Carolina left, to be sure, we 18 lost the ability to take money and help North 19 Carolina. But the notion that North Carolina, if it 20 had completed this facility, was not going to have a 21 license to print money in the -- in going forward and 22 that funding wouldn't have been available back in 23 those days is not in the record. And, frankly, it's 24 completely counterintuitive, because they have a 25 monopoly. That's what the compact specifically
86 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 provides for them, is the monopoly to be able to 2 control the fees that -- on these particular wastes. 3 Yes, Your Honor? 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: The ability to withdraw 5 terminates upon completion of the facility? 6 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Six months afterwards. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Six months afterwards. So 8 the -- the facility's completed. It's clear they are 9 going to have to -- they are going to be charging 10 more than South Carolina, which is a lower cost 11 facility, having been in existence for longer. Why 12 wouldn't everybody get out? 13 MR. PHILLIPS: Because the risk that South 14 Carolina is going to pull up stakes and stop because 15 it's been making that noise from the beginning -16 that was the reason for the crisis. Washington and 17 South Carolina said: We're not going to take every 18 other -- every other State's waste, and we are 19 getting out of this business. So the risk you would 20 take in jumping out in the six months is that you 21 then find out at the back end you have no place to 22 dispose of your waste. 23 So the reality is, they had -- all of the 24 incentives to go forward existed as much in 1997 as 25 they did in 1995, as they did in 1999. The only
87 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 thing that's fundamental here is they had a 2 responsibility not just to do what was appropriate; 3 it was to do what was appropriate to get a license, 4 and that's what they never did. They walked away. 5 They took no action. Trying to negotiate funding in 6 the abstract doesn't have anything to do with moving 7 forward to get a license. On that score, the 8 authority shut down and closed. 9 Justice Sotomayor, you asked: Is there any 10 benefit that remains? Well, the reality is, geology 11 studies and hydrology studies that get done, those 12 things don't change for a billion years. So every 13 one of those studies that was done is going to be 14 just as valid today 12 years later, although I do 15 think the right way to analyze this is not in terms 16 of 12 years later, but what would have happened at 17 the time. 18 I thank Your Honors. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 20 The case is submitted. 21 (Whereupon, at 11:37 a.m., the case in the 22 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 23 24 25
