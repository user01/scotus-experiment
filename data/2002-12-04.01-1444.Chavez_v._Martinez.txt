 2 (11:09 a.m.)
 3 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument in
 4 Number 01-1444, Chavez against Martinez.
 5 Mr. Robbins, whenever you're prepared, you may
 6 proceed.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 9 MR. ROBBINS: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and
 10 may it please the Court:
 11 The Ninth Circuit held in this case that
 12 petitioner Ben Chavez could not assert a qualified
 13 immunity defense to a section 1983 lawsuit alleging that
 14 his interrogation of respondent violated the Fifth and
 15 Fourteenth Amendments. 
 We believe that ruling to be 16 mistaken. 
 17 First, there was no constitutional violation at
 18 all on these facts. But second, if there was a
 19 constitutional right implicated, that right was not
 20 clearly established in the particularized sense required
 21 by this Court's qualified immunity cases. Officer Chavez
 22 could not reasonably have known that what he was doing
 23 violated that right, and the judgment of the Ninth Circuit
 24 should, therefore, be reversed. 
 25 QUESTION: May I ask this question on that point

3 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that you addressed before you get through? Supposing he
 2 thought at the time of the questioning that the
 3 material -- the answers would be used in evidence later
 4 on, and he knew that it would have been a violation of the
 5 Constitution to use those answers later on. Would he be
 6 entitled to qualified immunity then? 
 7 MR. ROBBINS: Yes, because the Constitution --
 8 well, because the first inquiry would be has the
 9 Constitution been violated. Whether he thought --
 10 QUESTION: But your -- I'm just directing my
 11 question at -- you sort of said even assuming a
 12 constitutional violation, he nevertheless is entitled to
 13 good faith immunity. And I'm saying, well, assume the --
 14 the facts I've just granted, including an assumption that
 15 the -- it would have been a constitutional violation to 16 use the evidence. 
 17 MR. ROBBINS: Well, I think -- I think the --
 18 the answer is that while -- while he might have believed
 19 that the Constitution would in time be violated, because
 20 he could not himself violate it, he couldn't -- he
 21 couldn't be liable under section 1983 for committing a
 22 Fifth Amendment violation. So the point is you don't even
 23 get to the question of clearly established if there's no
 24 established constitutional violation at all. 
 25 QUESTION: But we -- we do somehow extend the

4 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Fifth Amendment protection to the period before the actual
 2 introduction of the evidence in a criminal trial. That is
 3 to say, we -- we permit a witness to refuse to answer
 4 unless the witness is given -- is given immunity from
 5 prosecution. Now, how do you explain that, unless somehow
 6 the Fifth Amendment has some antecedent application before
 7 the evidence is actually --
 8 MR. ROBBINS: Well --
 9 QUESTION: -- introduced at trial?
 10 MR. ROBBINS: I -- I think you've put it exactly
 11 right. It has some antecedent application. That is to
 12 say, it applies prior to the moment at which it's actually
 13 violated. The premise is we need to ensure against -- in
 14 a way it's a prophylactic protection much like Miranda is. 
 15 That is to say, we will let you assert it in what is 16 concededly, for example, a civil litigation setting, a
 17 simple deposition. No one would suggest that that is a
 18 use in a criminal case. But we allow you to assert it
 19 because if we didn't, it would compromise your ability to
 20 ensure that the right is protected later.
 21 QUESTION: Well, suppose in a civil case, the
 22 judge orders the witness confined to custody until he
 23 testifies in violation of what we can say in common
 24 parlance is his Fifth Amendment right to self-
 25 incrimination. Is that not a violation then and there

5 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to -- to confine the -- the defendant until he testifies?
 2 MR. ROBBINS: I think it is consistent with a
 3 body of well -- well-developed law that to penalize
 4 someone, particularly through that kind of a sanction, for
 5 the assertion of a right is in the nature of a -- sort of
 6 an unconstitutional condition. And there's a well-
 7 established body of law that says --
 8 QUESTION: I -- I don't know that we usually
 9 talk about a violation as an unconstitutional condition. 
 10 We -- we would say, Your Honor, I want my client released
 11 because you are violating his Fifth Amendment rights.
 12 MR. ROBBINS: But I -- I --
 13 QUESTION: And I think in a very realistic --
 14 real sense you are. 
 15 MR. ROBBINS: Yes. 
 I -- I think there is a body 16 of case law that says that if you are punished for the
 17 assertion of a right, then under the Constitution you can
 18 be relieved of that coercion. 
 19 However -- but let me be clear -- the actual
 20 violation of the Fifth Amendment is exactly what the text
 21 of the Fifth Amendment says. It says that your right is
 22 not to be a witness against yourself in a criminal case. 
 23 I suggest, Justice Kennedy, that the result -- that the
 24 holding in Murphy against the Waterfront Commission is
 25 inexplicable if you believe, as the Ninth Circuit does,

6 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that it is sufficient simply to coerce an otherwise
 2 incriminating statement because in Murphy against the
 3 Waterfront Commission, the holding of that case is that
 4 the State court was correct in requiring the witness to
 5 testify even though there wasn't a statute that protected
 6 him against incrimination because the Fifth Amendment
 7 itself provides the fail-safe that if you are coerced into
 8 giving an otherwise incriminating statement, it cannot be
 9 used against you. 
 10 And my central submission on the Fifth Amendment
 11 point -- and of course, this is before we even get to the
 12 question whether Office Chavez could have -- you know, has
 13 qualified immunity. Our central submission on this is
 14 that you don't even have to get to that point because the
 15 fail-safe of the Fifth Amendment ensures that 16 Mr. Martinez's statements could not be used against him in
 17 a criminal case if they were indeed legally compelled --
 18 QUESTION: What -- what in your opinion in the
 19 Constitution prevents a policeman from going and beating
 20 up a witness? 
 21 MR. ROBBINS: The Fourteenth Amendment. 
 22 QUESTION: So, the Fourteenth Amendment means
 23 that you could -- in other words, your -- your client
 24 could have violated the Fourteenth Amendment if -- other
 25 things being equal --

7 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ROBBINS: Well --
 2 QUESTION: -- because he was a witness. He gets
 3 at least -- at least the suspect --
 4 MR. ROBBINS: Yes. 
 5 QUESTION: -- gets the same pre-trial protection
 6 as a witness would, and the Fourteenth Amendment prevents
 7 coercion being used against a witness who doesn't want to
 8 testify.
 9 MR. ROBBINS: Well, let's be clear. It doesn't
 10 prevent all coercion. It prevents a subset of coercion
 11 that shocks the conscience for purposes of the -- the
 12 substantive component of due process.
 13 QUESTION: The substantive due process. 
 14 MR. ROBBINS: Yes, Justice O'Connor. That's
 15 correct. 
 16 But -- but I think it is important that we not
 17 torture the language of the Fifth Amendment to accommodate
 18 the worry that police officers will torture witnesses
 19 because that concern is completely -- can be completely
 20 accommodated, and routinely is in the courts of appeals,
 21 under the aegis of the --
 22 QUESTION: You're not saying -- those things
 23 that would violate the Fifth Amendment weren't introduced
 24 into trial do violate the Fourteenth Amendment for the
 25 similar reasons.

8 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ROBBINS: I'm sorry.
 2 QUESTION: Well, I mean, could you say --
 3 MR. ROBBINS: Yes. 
 4 QUESTION: -- that those things -- you could say
 5 that. 
 6 MR. ROBBINS: Yes. You -- you could say --
 7 QUESTION: All right. Then why didn't he
 8 violate the Fourteenth Amendment? 
 9 MR. ROBBINS: Well, he -- well, again, let me --
 10 I -- I want to answer that, but I -- I -- because this is
 11 a qualified immunity case, I always want to drop the
 12 footnote that we have an extra layer of protection here
 13 arising from the fact that none of these propositions
 14 could have been -- none of the propositions adverse to us
 15 could plausibly be said to be clearly established within 16 the right sense of the term. 
 17 Getting to your question, Justice Breyer, he did
 18 not violate the substantive component of the Due Process
 19 Clause because that inquiry turns on a set of concerns,
 20 including did the acts shock the conscience. Were they
 21 committed with the intent to harm the witness in the sense
 22 required by Sacramento against Lewis? 
 23 The failure of the Ninth Circuit in this case
 24 with respect to the substantive due process analysis was
 25 that it thought that any interrogation which would render

9 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 a statement involuntary and therefore inadmissible at
 2 trial must, therefore, give rise to a freestanding
 3 substantive due process claim, actionable and enforceable
 4 under section 1983. That's just wrong. 
 5 QUESTION: Mr. Robbins, going back to the Fifth
 6 Amendment self-incrimination privilege, I take it the
 7 thrust of your argument is that a police officer who fails
 8 to give Miranda warnings quite deliberately, doesn't say
 9 you have a right to remain silent, doesn't say any of the
 10 rest of it, never commits a violation of 1983 unless and
 11 until there's attempt to use the information in court. So
 12 you can say, police officer, you're not required to give
 13 Miranda warnings if we're not going to use this testimony
 14 in court.
 15 MR. ROBBINS: 
 I am saying -- I think the answer 16 to that is yes. The -- the --
 17 QUESTION: So that the Miranda is -- is not an
 18 obligation of the police officer. 
 19 MR. ROBBINS: I -- I respectfully beg to differ,
 20 and I -- I also think -- I must say, given the prominence
 21 of the Miranda discussion in the respondent's brief and in
 22 the green -- green brief supporting respondent, I believe
 23 the Miranda concerns in this case are an utter red
 24 herring, and let me say why.
 25 The sanction for the violation of Miranda is, in

10 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 fact, that the statements taken in violation of Miranda
 2 cannot be used in the direct case of the government. 
 3 That's the penalty for Miranda, and if that happens, you
 4 get the statement struck in the direct case for the
 5 government. 
 6 QUESTION: But there -- you're saying there is
 7 no 1983 penalty. The penalty is you can't --
 8 MR. ROBBINS: I -- I think there is no 1983
 9 penalty, but the suggestion that as a consequence, because
 10 you don't have a freestanding section 1983 claim when the
 11 evidence never comes in, when the statement is never
 12 offered, the suggestion that that is therefore going to
 13 be -- send a signal to police officers that they should
 14 violate Miranda, you know, at their -- at their discretion
 15 I think is terribly mistaken, and for a very important 16 reason and it's this: If you don't give Miranda warnings,
 17 you run a serious risk that the failure to give those
 18 warnings will be taken as part of the calculus under the
 19 Fifth Amendment voluntariness inquiry. And a statement
 20 which is involuntary for Fifth Amendment purposes is
 21 unusable for any purpose at all, direct case, impeachment,
 22 derivative use. The government then has to put on a
 23 Kastigar hearing to show that all of its evidence was
 24 independently derived, which is, as the Court said in
 25 Kastigar, a heavy burden for the government to meet.

11 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 It is a fool's errand I suggest, Justice
 2 Ginsburg -- a fool's errand -- to go about deliberately
 3 violating Miranda simply because the violation will not
 4 cause -- give rise to a section 1983 violation. 
 5 QUESTION: I -- I just have to tell you, I -- I
 6 can see your -- your point on Miranda. Miranda is an
 7 exclusionary rule. But I'm not sure that all of the Fifth
 8 Amendment is -- is treated in that way because of the
 9 questions we've initially covered.
 10 MR. ROBBINS: Well --
 11 QUESTION: If -- if you beat the defendant to
 12 get the defendant -- to get the confession, it seems to me
 13 there's a very strong argument that that is a Fifth
 14 Amendment violation --
 15 MR. ROBBINS: I think --
 16 QUESTION: -- A Self-incrimination Clause
 17 violation.
 18 MR. ROBBINS: I think -- respectfully, Justice
 19 Kennedy, I think there is a wealth of this Court -- this
 20 Court's cases that cannot be reconciled with the
 21 proposition that coercing a statement is enough by itself
 22 to constitute a Fifth Amendment violation.
 23 QUESTION: All right. You -- I think you could
 24 say after -- after 30 years or 50 years of -- of
 25 jurisprudence, policemen know they're not supposed to beat

12 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 up suspects or the -- the equivalent. And -- and you can
 2 say, all right, at this point, I would think that does
 3 shock the conscience for a policeman to beat a confession
 4 out of somebody, and so I don't care if you call it
 5 Fourteenth or Fifth. 
 6 But then the question here would be, why in
 7 heaven's name, when the person is undergoing serious pain,
 8 or he thinks he's dying, where the doctors are saying, get
 9 out of here, et cetera, whatever they're saying, and he
 10 continues to press and then says, well, you're going to
 11 get your treatment after you confess -- not confess --
 12 after -- after you answer my question. What were you
 13 doing? Then we'll treat you. He says, you want your
 14 treatment, you'd better -- you better say something,
 15 et cetera, et cetera. 
 Why isn't that the equivalent of 16 beating somebody up?
 17 MR. ROBBINS: Well, let me attempt, if -- if I
 18 might, Justice Breyer, to -- to very quickly answer
 19 Justice Kennedy's question. I -- I think the belief that
 20 the Ninth Circuit held that it's enough under the Fifth
 21 Amendment simply to coerce a statement that would
 22 otherwise be incriminating cannot be reconciled with
 23 Murphy and with the -- with Balsys, with the immunity
 24 cases, with all the cases that stand for the proposition
 25 that so long as the use immunity has not been compromised,

13 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 you do not yet have a substantive Fifth Amendment
 2 violation.
 3 To turn, Justice Breyer, to your question, I
 4 acknowledge that there is coercion in this case. We
 5 don't -- we don't blanch on that. There was coercion and
 6 the facts of this case are tragic, but the -- but the
 7 reality is this. This officer was there to find out a
 8 very important piece of information under extraordinarily
 9 exigent circumstances. 
 10 QUESTION: Well, was this tried below with a
 11 Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claim?
 12 MR. ROBBINS: I don't know that it was
 13 denominated substantive due process. I think --
 14 QUESTION: Is that in the case? 
 15 MR. ROBBINS: I --
 16 QUESTION: I mean, is it open to resolution on
 17 that basis? 
 18 MR. ROBBINS: There's -- there's no question
 19 that the Ninth Circuit decided a Fourteenth Amendment due
 20 process question. I don't think they -- they labeled it
 21 substantive versus procedure. And indeed, as we
 22 suggest --
 23 QUESTION: Well, if --
 24 MR. ROBBINS: -- they conflated the two.
 25 QUESTION: -- if -- if we think the facts here

14 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 show sufficient coercion to rise to the level of a
 2 violation of substantive due process under the Fourteenth
 3 Amendment, should the judgment be affirmed --
 4 MR. ROBBINS: No. 
 5 QUESTION: -- but on a different basis?
 6 MR. ROBBINS: The judgment must be reversed,
 7 first, because there is not even a suggestion that the
 8 intent to harm requirement under Sacramento against Lewis
 9 has been satisfied. And under this -- in this kind of a
 10 case, you cannot have a substantive due -- due process
 11 violation without that. No one before you today has
 12 argued that that Sacramento against Lewis --
 13 QUESTION: What is -- what is the source of the
 14 substantive -- of the intentional harm requirement? 
 15 MR. ROBBINS: 
 Is that -- the source I -- I 16 suggest is the -- the principles this Court articulated in
 17 Sacramento against Lewis for police conduct that's taken
 18 in enormous haste where -- where there is not the
 19 opportunity for a second chance.
 20 But let me go -- there's a terribly important
 21 thing, Justice O'Connor, I have not yet gotten to say in
 22 answer to your question. The further and perhaps most
 23 fundamental reason why it would be a mistake, I
 24 respectfully suggest, to affirm this judgment, even on the
 25 due process argument, is that this is a qualified immunity

15 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 case. So you must conclude not only that on balance this
 2 rises to the shock-the-conscience standard, but that it
 3 does so with such remarkable clarity that it must have
 4 been surely apparent to this officer that he was violating
 5 that standard. You cannot find that on this record. 
 6 The Ninth Circuit thought so because of Mincey,
 7 which is a fair trial and admissibility of evidence case,
 8 not a freestanding substantive due process case and which
 9 had all manner of important differences from the facts of
 10 this case, including an absence -- a total absence -- of
 11 exigency.
 12 With the Court's permission --
 13 QUESTION: Exigency. May I ask you a question
 14 about that? You said the man was dying. This was the
 15 only -- only chance. 
 But there was an eyewitness, Flores, 16 to this entire thing. Why wasn't it enough for the
 17 police, if they wanted some view other than the police
 18 officers who engaged in the -- in the shooting, just to
 19 interview Flores? 
 20 MR. ROBBINS: Well, I -- I think the record
 21 suggests that he was not a completely clear -- did not
 22 have a completely clear view of the facts. But he's just
 23 one witness. This is the man who was there.
 24 QUESTION: Wouldn't he be a lot clearer than a
 25 man who -- who is -- who has been blinded, who has -- was

16 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 paralyzed, who's under heavy medication?
 2 MR. ROBBINS: Well, he -- he was the most
 3 important non-police witness to these events, and I
 4 suggest that the officer would have been derelict not to
 5 have found out what happened from him, which is what he
 6 was trying to do. 
 7 And with the Court's permission, I'd like to
 8 reserve the balance of my time. 
 9 QUESTION: Yes, you may do so, Mr. Robbins.
 10 Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you.
 11 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
 12 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
 13 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
 14 MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and
 15 may it please the Court:
 16 The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-
 17 incrimination safeguards the integrity of the criminal
 18 trial process and ensures that an individual is not
 19 convicted on the basis of a coerced confession. 
 20 But the privilege against self-incrimination is
 21 not a direct limit on the primary conduct of the law
 22 enforcement officers. This is not to say that there are
 23 no substantive constitutional limits on what law officers
 24 may do to obtain information or to secure a confession.
 25 But those limits are to be found in the Fourth Amendment

17 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 and in the law of substantive due process, not in the
 2 Fifth Amendment self-incrimination privilege --
 3 QUESTION: So beating a prisoner to compel a --
 4 a statement is not a Fifth Amendment violation.
 5 MR. CLEMENT: That's right, Justice Kennedy. 
 6 It's not a Fifth Amendment violation. It very well might
 7 be --
 8 QUESTION: But it could be a Fourteenth
 9 Amendment violation. 
 10 MR. CLEMENT: It very well -- Justice O'Connor,
 11 it very well could be a Fourteenth --
 12 QUESTION: And very likely would be. 
 13 Is there some intent element in that for the
 14 shocks-the-conscience --
 15 MR. CLEMENT: 
 Well, I think generally, at least 16 as I understand this Court's decision in -- in Sacramento
 17 against Lewis, in these kind of executive action contexts
 18 where things are ongoing, I think there is some kind of
 19 intent element. I think that --
 20 QUESTION: It's not enough, you think, to find
 21 that the officer should have known that you couldn't ask
 22 questions in the manner that was done here under these
 23 circumstances, and that to proceed gives rise to an
 24 inference of intent.
 25 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I'm not sure how intent

18 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 would need to be proven in any particular case, but I
 2 would say the critical difference between the Fifth
 3 Amendment inquiry and the Fourteenth Amendment inquiry,
 4 when it's -- when it's done in the context of the
 5 admissibility of a coerced confession, is in that context,
 6 what the courts are taking into account is the effect on
 7 the integrity of the trial process of using a coerced
 8 confession. 
 9 It's a different calculus, though, when you're
 10 trying to regulate primary law enforcement conduct because
 11 it strikes me that not everything that a law enforcement
 12 officer could do to coerce a confession -- there -- there
 13 may be some acts that may be sufficiently problematic that
 14 you'd certainly want to keep the confession out of the
 15 trial.
 16 QUESTION: What about the order of a trial judge
 17 in a civil case who orders the witness held in contempt
 18 and confined unless he testifies, and -- and there's a
 19 valid Fifth Amendment privilege that the judge is
 20 overlooking? No Fifth Amendment violation there?
 21 MR. CLEMENT: No. I don't think there's a Fifth
 22 Amendment -- I don't think there's a complete Fifth
 23 Amendment violation. The courts intervene there to
 24 protect the privilege. 
 25 QUESTION: So, if you go in and you want a writ

19 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 of habeas corpus and you don't mention the Fifth
 2 Amendment. 
 3 MR. CLEMENT: You mention the Fifth Amendment,
 4 but I think the important thing is the Fifth Amendment in
 5 this context works a -- a bit like the takings clause. 
 6 And Justice Souter, for the opinion for the Court in
 7 Balsys, noted that the self-incrimination privilege is
 8 unusual because it's not purely and simply binding on the
 9 government. It doesn't say that in all contexts, the
 10 government cannot coerce confessions. What it says --
 11 QUESTION: Well, if there's a 1983 suit against
 12 a judge in -- in this hypothetical case, what's -- what's
 13 the violation?
 14 MR. CLEMENT: Well, typically those cases have
 15 been dealt with on -- on habeas. 
 And what I would say 16 is --
 17 QUESTION: Suppose it's a 1983 suit.
 18 MR. CLEMENT: If there's a 1983 suit in that
 19 context, I actually don't think a 1983 suit would lie in
 20 that context.
 21 QUESTION: Why wouldn't there be a 1983 suit
 22 provided that -- and I think this is the assumption of
 23 Justice Kennedy's question -- provided that the witness
 24 had invoked the Fifth Amendment? There would be a 1983
 25 action there because that is one at least of two instances

20 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 in which we allow the Fifth Amendment to have an
 2 application in anticipation. We say if he raises it, and
 3 they don't come forward with immunity, we're not going to
 4 let this entire process go forward to no avail since
 5 nothing can ever be admitted in evidence anyway. The fact
 6 is we -- the -- the rule allowing it to be raised in
 7 anticipation I suppose would be the predicate for 1983
 8 liability here. That's not this case, but that -- that
 9 would be true in the -- in the case of the -- the civil
 10 example that Justice Kennedy gave, wouldn't it?
 11 MR. CLEMENT: I think that's a very good point,
 12 Justice Souter, and the Court has also treated in the
 13 penalty context --
 14 QUESTION: Well, is it good enough so that you
 15 concede there would be 1983 liability there; i.e., that 16 there would be a violation of the Fifth Amendment in that
 17 case?
 18 MR. CLEMENT: I don't think so, but I think it
 19 would --
 20 QUESTION: Not that good.
 21 MR. CLEMENT: -- at least be a better case.
 22 But as I was trying to say --
 23 QUESTION: Is there any violation in the case
 24 that I put, any constitutional violation? I mean,
 25 that's -- that's extraordinary.

21 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. CLEMENT: There is a -- there is a --
 2 there -- what there is is there is an ongoing interference
 3 with the Fifth Amendment right that the courts will
 4 vindicate, but there isn't a complete constitutional
 5 violation. And I think the critical distinction is that,
 6 as -- as Justice Souter said for the Court in Balsys, the
 7 privilege against self-incrimination is not purely and
 8 simply binding on the government. The government can
 9 compel testimony in exchange for a valid grant of
 10 immunity. What it can't do is compel testimony and
 11 attempt to use it in a criminal case. And --
 12 QUESTION: Well, maybe the -- the point where it
 13 would make a difference I guess -- nobody is talking about
 14 weakening or overruling Miranda. We have Miranda on the
 15 books, and Miranda set some technical requirements. You
 16 have to give a warning. Now, a failure to give a warning,
 17 pure and simple, is not going to hurt anybody if that's
 18 never used in trial, so there isn't 1983 damages, unless
 19 you beat the person up. Then there is. And that comes
 20 under the Fourteenth. 
 21 But there are a set of cases where it will hurt
 22 people. The set of cases where it will hurt people is
 23 where because they violated Miranda but didn't beat him
 24 up, and got a statement, they kept him in jail. That's
 25 rather like the case Justice Kennedy's thinking of. So

22 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 there he is in jail for a week or a month and he's been
 2 hurt, all right. 
 3 And the question I guess is -- it's really not
 4 this case, but the question is, is there going to be a
 5 1983 action in that kind of case? And if you say it comes
 6 under the Fifth Amendment, the answer is going to be yes. 
 7 And if you say it comes under the Fourteenth Amendment,
 8 the answer is going to be no. I don't know if we
 9 should -- it seems to me what we're going to decide in
 10 this case is effectively going to decide that.
 11 MR. CLEMENT: No. I don't think that's true. 
 12 I think that, for one thing, if the person is imprisoned
 13 on some basis, that may raise an independent Fourth
 14 Amendment violation. There may be other --
 15 QUESTION: 
 Then he goes under the Fourth, and he 16 claims he's wrongly seized and imprisoned because they got
 17 this statement out of him in violation of the Fifth. 
 18 That's -- I mean, this is -- this is what's -- what's
 19 worrying me is not so much this case, but what we're going
 20 to write and the implications of it.
 21 MR. CLEMENT: And -- and I think that this Court
 22 has already clarified in Balsys that what you need for a
 23 self-incrimination violation is both the coercion of the
 24 testimony and the use of it in a criminal case.
 25 QUESTION: But may I just interrupt,

23 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Mr. Clement? Supposing there's a witness, a reporter or
 2 somebody, who claims a -- a privilege against divulging
 3 information, and that -- and the court holds him in
 4 contempt and locks him up for 30 days or something, and he
 5 claims he -- his Fifth Amendment right was violated, you'd
 6 say there's no Fifth Amendment violation.
 7 MR. CLEMENT: I would say there's no -- there's
 8 no damages action. Of course, he could get --
 9 QUESTION: So how could he get out of jail then?
 10 MR. CLEMENT: Well, he could get a habeas action
 11 to get out because the court would be granting relief --
 12 QUESTION: Well, I -- I think --
 13 MR. CLEMENT: -- to protect the Fifth
 14 Amendment --
 15 QUESTION: 
 With all respect, I think you're 16 evading the point that there -- let's assume there's
 17 damage. He's -- he's locked up, as Justice Breyer says,
 18 for 5 days for not testifying, and you say there's no
 19 Fifth Amendment violation. I can't understand that.
 20 MR. CLEMENT: Well, in any event, let me just
 21 say that the privilege works quite differently in the
 22 custodial context. The reason that hypo even comes up is
 23 that in the context of a civil trial, the individual has
 24 to raise the -- the Self-incrimination Clause themselves. 
 25 And we have a different rule that operates in the context

24 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 of police custodial interrogation. In that context, the
 2 privilege is self-executing. The individual doesn't have
 3 to raise it. 
 4 And -- as -- the other thing that's different
 5 about the custodial context is that in the custodial
 6 context, this Court has not insisted on a pre-testimony
 7 grant of immunity. They've always held that the
 8 exclusionary rules prevent a constitutional violation from
 9 occurring.
 10 And if I could resort to the analogy to the
 11 takings clause. In that context, it's not enough for the
 12 government to take property. It's only a constitutional
 13 violation if the -- if the government simultaneously takes
 14 property and refuses to grant just compensation. In the
 15 same way, there's no self --
 16 QUESTION: But are you saying that -- to go back
 17 to a question that was asked earlier, that if there -- if
 18 the police just take somebody into custody and beat him up
 19 in order to get -- get him to talk with no intention of
 20 using the evidence at all -- they're just trying to
 21 investigate a crime -- is there any constitutional
 22 protection against that kind of conduct?
 23 MR. CLEMENT: Yes, and it's the substantive due
 24 process protection. 
 25 QUESTION: Okay. 

25 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. CLEMENT: And I think to get back to that
 2 point, what's important is in the context of trying to
 3 protect the integrity of the criminal trial process, I
 4 would think the courts would want to be quite careful
 5 about what they let into evidence. But in the context of
 6 law enforcement officers, they're dealing with other
 7 objectives than simply trying to get a confession to
 8 secure a guilty verdict. 
 9 QUESTION: Well, on the facts of this case,
 10 should it be analyzed then under the Fourteenth Amendment
 11 for coercion --
 12 MR. CLEMENT: It --
 13 QUESTION: -- an activity that might violate the
 14 Fourteenth Amendment? 
 15 MR. CLEMENT: 
 I think it should, Justice 16 O'Connor, and I would respectfully suggest that that's
 17 best done on remand --
 18 QUESTION: Yes.
 19 MR. CLEMENT: -- because, although there is a
 20 due process argument in this case, it's nobody's fault
 21 that in light of the -- the governing precedent in the
 22 Ninth Circuit, the Cooper decision, that nobody thought
 23 that they had to prove shocks-the-conscience, or any of
 24 the factors relevant to a substantive due process inquiry. 
 25 Again, that's not the way respondents briefed the case,

26 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 but one can hardly blame them for briefing the case they
 2 did, given that the Ninth Circuit had held under Cooper
 3 that as long as the conduct was sufficiently egregious to
 4 have the evidence be inadmissible, therefore you have a
 5 full substantive due process violation. And I think
 6 it's --
 7 QUESTION: And you disagree with Mr. Robbins who
 8 said, but because of the qualified immunity, you wouldn't
 9 send this back in any case.
 10 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I -- I don't really disagree
 11 with him. I think this Court could reach the qualified
 12 immunity issue if it wanted to, but I think perhaps the
 13 path of least resistance would be to just note that there
 14 is a substantive due process limit, and that's something
 15 that's best to be resolved on -- on remand. 16 I think the important -- oh, sorry.
 17 QUESTION: That's all right. You can make that
 18 sentence, if you want to.
 19 MR. CLEMENT: No. 
 20 QUESTION: Okay. 
 21 MR. CLEMENT: Thank you very much. 
 22 QUESTION: Mr. Paz.
 23 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD S. PAZ
 24 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 25 MR. PAZ: Justice Stevens, and if it pleases the

27 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Court:
 2 I -- I would start with simply the simple
 3 observation that the district court made a finding of fact
 4 in this case at page -- it's 28a and 29 of the petition
 5 for writ of certiorari in the -- in the appendix. And it
 6 goes directly to the issue of what we've been discussing
 7 and that is the -- the intent. 
 8 And just if I can back up a little bit
 9 procedurally, in argument today, for the first time I
 10 heard counsel say that they acknowledge there's no quarrel
 11 that there was coercion in this case. In the district
 12 court, the entire argument was there was no coercion. 
 13 At the court of appeals, the entire argument was there was
 14 no coercion. 
 15 At the court of appeals and the district court, 16 the -- there was never a discussion or -- or even was the
 17 case of Urquidez -- Verdugo Urquidez cited for the fact
 18 of -- that this was -- the Fifth and the Fourteenth
 19 Amendments were only a trial right. Those issues are
 20 being heard here for the first time. They were briefed
 21 for the first time in the opening brief.
 22 Cert was granted in this case on whether there
 23 was a violation of the Fifth Amendment, not -- the
 24 Fourteenth Amendment wasn't even discussed on cert. 
 25 So we've gone through this journey of ever-

28 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 changing theories of -- of liability in this case, but I
 2 think we have to go back to the beginning.
 3 The district court found at page 28, finally
 4 defendants argued that Chavez was not attempting to
 5 abridge the right against self-incrimination to -- to
 6 exact -- extract self-inculpatory data or leads. And the
 7 court goes on to then describe what was argued by the
 8 defense, that Mr. Chavez was there simply to find out what
 9 happened. 
 10 The court directly rejected that.
 11 QUESTION: Mr. Paz, I'm sorry. I don't -- your
 12 page 28 in the cert petition?
 13 MR. PAZ: It's 28a in the appendix of the -- of
 14 the petition for cert, yes, Justice Stevens.
 15 QUESTION: And where? 
 I didn't -- I don't find 16 it on that page.
 17 MR. PAZ: It starts at the -- at approximately
 18 the -- the bottom of the page.
 19 QUESTION: "Finally defendants argue --"? 
 20 MR. PAZ: Yes. 
 21 QUESTION: Okay. I'm with you.
 22 MR. PAZ: Yes. 
 23 So the district court carefully looked at the
 24 evidence that had been presented, and the district court
 25 decided the case really because the testimony of Chavez at

29 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the time the tape recordings that he made on the day of
 2 the incident and his deposition testimony -- he said
 3 simply, I'm investigating the crime. I was there to
 4 investigate what -- the crime had been committed, the
 5 crime of attempted murder on two police officers on the
 6 theory that somehow or other this farm worker had taken
 7 away the officer's gun and was going to use it on the
 8 officers when they shot him. That was the core of the
 9 case. That was all of the evidence in the case. 
 10 The subsequent declarations that were submitted
 11 were only submitted after -- after Mr. Martinez submitted
 12 a motion for summary judgment that as a matter of law,
 13 using all of the evidence provided by the defense and
 14 giving them the benefit of the doubt on all the evidence,
 15 that there was a violation of the Fifth and the Fourteenth 16 Amendment. 
 17 QUESTION: Mr. Paz, let me -- let me tell you
 18 why I have difficulty with the proposition which you're
 19 urging, which is that any coercion that would suffice to
 20 require the confession to be excluded from -- from trial
 21 is also a coercion that violates the Fifth Amendment,
 22 not -- leaving substantive due process aside. 
 23 Suppose you have a situation in which a --
 24 a felon has taken a hostage and buried the hostage
 25 somewhere, and suppose that it is possible for the police

30 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 official to use a degree of coercion which would not shock
 2 the conscience. It isn't beating the person with a rubber
 3 hose, but let's say failing to give a Miranda warning, or
 4 using a -- a sort of trickery that -- that would amount to
 5 coercion, threatening perhaps, you know, if you don't
 6 confess, your brother will be prosecuted or something like
 7 that. It would be sufficient to exclude the testimony
 8 from the confession from the trial, but the policeman
 9 doesn't care about that. He wants to save the life of
 10 the -- of the hostage who's been -- who's been buried. 
 11 Now, you would say that that -- that policeman
 12 by extracting that confession has violated the Fifth
 13 Amendment. 
 14 MR. PAZ: There may be a violation, and -- and I
 15 would agree that most likely if -- if it was in violation 16 of Miranda, there would be -- there would be no -- it
 17 would not be admitted into a criminal case. Maybe -- it
 18 may be under the Quarles exception. 
 19 QUESTION: What -- you'd say that the person
 20 would -- would have a -- a 1983 action against the
 21 policeman? 
 22 MR. PAZ: No. No, I think clearly that's the
 23 kind of a case in which qualified immunity was designed to
 24 prevent. Qualified immunity gives as -- as it did in --
 25 in --

31 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Only because of qualified immunity?
 2 QUESTION: Well -- well, let -- let's assume
 3 that we decide the case, and then this happens a second
 4 time.
 5 MR. PAZ: Then -- then clearly --
 6 QUESTION: You have to answer Justice Scalia's
 7 question. You can't get away on qualified immunity.
 8 MR. PAZ: Oh, no, no. I would say --
 9 (Laughter.) 
 10 MR. PAZ: I -- I would say Quarles gives us the
 11 direction. When there is an immediate danger, when
 12 there's a danger to the public, then clearly there would
 13 be no constitutional violation. The Court has already
 14 made that decision. I -- I don't think that that's really
 15 an issue that we have to struggle with. 16 QUESTION: You can violate the Fifth Amendment
 17 when there's a danger to the public?
 18 MR. PAZ: That's what Quarles, I believe, says. 
 19 Quarles says that -- that the Miranda violation was not --
 20 was not sufficient. And I -- as I -- as I recall in
 21 Quarles, the evidence was admitted against him. He -- he
 22 said, the gun is over there, and that evidence came in to
 23 prove the violation of -- of possession of a weapon. So I
 24 think that the Court implicitly said that we're -- in this
 25 emergency situation, that there is no -- no Fifth

32 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Amendment --
 2 QUESTION: You -- you think this applies not
 3 only to the -- the unique aspect of the Fifth Amendment
 4 that -- that Miranda constitutes, but to all Fifth
 5 Amendment violations.
 6 MR. PAZ: No. What I -- I think once it becomes
 7 coercive, once it becomes physical, once it becomes --
 8 then I think that you would interfere with the core values
 9 of -- of the Fifth Amendment. 
 10 QUESTION: Justice Scalia's hypothetical asked
 11 about coercion. There was no coercion in Quarles. There
 12 was just an absence of Miranda warning. 
 13 Forget Miranda. Let's just talk about coercion. 
 14 Is there a Fifth Amendment violation in the case that he
 15 put where there was -- there's an element -- there's a -16 there's a degree of coercion? There's no Miranda warning.
 17 That's out of the case. There's no sovereign -- qualified
 18 immunity. That's out of the case.
 19 QUESTION: Coercion to keep it out of trial.
 20 MR. PAZ: I -- I would say yes that there is a
 21 Fifth Amendment violation. The question then would be,
 22 what is the remedy?
 23 Under those --
 24 QUESTION: -- section 1983.
 25 MR. PAZ: No. 

33 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: I mean, if it's a Fifth Amendment
 2 violation, you can sue the policeman. 
 3 MR. PAZ: Under those circumstances --
 4 QUESTION: Well, this person who goes to prison
 5 for -- for putting this person in a -- in a grave begins a
 6 suit when he's in prison suing the -- suing the policeman.
 7 MR. PAZ: And I don't believe that's -- that
 8 would be the conclusion because the remedy would not be
 9 appropriate because there had been, as we saw in -- in
 10 Saucier versus Katz, there's a situation in which the
 11 police have to act, and so the police act if it's
 12 reasonable, even if it's a reasonable mistake, even if
 13 they have the wrong guy and they try to coerce the wrong
 14 person, it may be reasonable under an emergency
 15 circumstance. 
 16 QUESTION: I see. So let's assume somebody
 17 is -- you think he's going to blow up the World Trade
 18 Center. I suppose if -- if we have this necessity -- this
 19 necessity exception, you -- you could beat him with a
 20 rubber hose.
 21 MR. PAZ: I would hope not, Your Honor. 
 22 QUESTION: Oh, it's necessary. 
 23 MR. PAZ: No. I think --
 24 QUESTION: Since when is -- is necessity a --
 25 you know, a justification for ignoring the Fifth

34 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Amendment? 
 2 MR. PAZ: Your Honor, only in the limited
 3 situation. I think the first hypothetical you gave me --
 4 gave us was you simply were going to ask him questions
 5 repeatedly. Now, I -- I don't think the rubber hose
 6 example was before me.
 7 QUESTION: Do you know -- okay. Do you know any
 8 of our -- any of our cases that -- other than Miranda
 9 which, you know, is -- is in a field by itself, do you
 10 know any of our cases that say that there is a necessity
 11 exception to the coercion prohibition of the Fifth
 12 Amendment? 
 13 MR. PAZ: Not at all, Your Honor. 
 14 QUESTION: So maybe the answer would be that --
 15 that it's not -- the Fifth Amendment -- the -- the Miranda 16 rules are methods of enforcing the Fifth Amendment so that
 17 if all is violated in -- in Justice Scalia's hypothetical
 18 is a Miranda rule and the person is not proceeded against
 19 in court and the person has not been physically injured in
 20 any way and has not suffered any real harm except not
 21 being read a right that didn't matter anyway, he would
 22 have no damages.
 23 MR. PAZ: That would be correct.
 24 QUESTION: So he could bring his lawsuit, but
 25 he'd gain nothing.

35 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. PAZ: I would agree with that analysis. 
 2 QUESTION: Except that my hypothetical was not
 3 Miranda. My hypothetical was that he was coerced in some
 4 fashion other than the failure to give a Miranda warning,
 5 and short of beating with a rubber hose.
 6 QUESTION: Yes.
 7 MR. PAZ: The distinct -- the distinct
 8 difference in this case is -- and I understand that the
 9 exigence is -- the exigent -- the -- the terrorist
 10 situation is a difficult one. It's not our case. 
 11 Mr. Martinez was riding a bicycle home. 
 12 QUESTION: It's not your case. That's right. 
 13 MR. PAZ: There was no call. There was no
 14 crime. There was nothing that had happened except he was
 15 riding his bicycle home. 
 So we really can't -- I don't 16 think that this is an appropriate vehicle. There may be
 17 such a case that will at some time --
 18 QUESTION: Well, maybe this is a Fourteenth
 19 Amendment case, not a Fifth Amendment case at all.
 20 MR. PAZ: I did -- I did consider that. And --
 21 and I think clearly it is a Fourteenth Amendment violation
 22 under all the cases --
 23 QUESTION: Was it tried on that basis --
 24 MR. PAZ: Yes.
 25 QUESTION: -- presented on that basis? 

36 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. PAZ: Yes, Justice O'Connor, it was. It
 2 was -- it was -- that was the allegations from -- from the
 3 beginning. But -- but --
 4 QUESTION: I don't see why the Fourteenth. I
 5 mean, the Fourteenth -- the Fifth applies to the States
 6 because it's incorporated in the Fourteenth.
 7 MR. PAZ: Correct. 
 8 QUESTION: And -- and therefore, if in fact you
 9 violate the Fifth in -- in a way that's significant, not
 10 just -- I mean, causes significant harm, not just you
 11 didn't read a Miranda right, but you hurt somebody, then
 12 why wouldn't the Fourteenth carry that through to the --
 13 QUESTION: By way of the Fourth Amendment. 
 14 MR. PAZ: Yes. I believe it does. I believe
 15 the history -- and the history -- the early cases, the -16 the Bram case in 1897 began with the concept of the -- of
 17 the Fifth Amendment protecting all of the rights. And of
 18 course, Bram was a case in which -- it was against the
 19 United States. 
 20 But as -- as -- there's an evolution that
 21 I've -- I've seen through our cases that -- that show that
 22 the Fourteenth Amendment, once it was incorporated, it
 23 actually incorporated the Fifth Amendment privileges. It
 24 actually -- the Fifth Amendment was really the -- the core
 25 values of what the Constitution meant to embody. It goes

37 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 back to -- Bram cites the early -- early cases in England
 2 where, although the right against self-incrimination was
 3 an evidentiary rule, in Bram they -- they laud the fact
 4 that it became a constitutional rule, that it became
 5 immutable so that no act of Congress -- as we decided in
 6 Dickerson not too long ago, no act of Congress could
 7 change that. So --
 8 QUESTION: But isn't it clear by now in our
 9 cases that if a policeman uses excessive force that rises
 10 to the level of a Fourth Amendment violation, that we will
 11 address it under that amendment, that the Fifth Amendment,
 12 the language of it refers to use in trial of the
 13 testimony? And -- and you don't have that limitation --
 14 MR. PAZ: I would --
 15 QUESTION: 
 -- under a substantive due process 16 claim. 
 17 MR. PAZ: I would disagree with you on one
 18 point, and that is the -- the language of the amendment
 19 talks about a criminal case, and in our brief, we did talk
 20 about the meaning, the distinction between a criminal
 21 trial and a criminal case. And all of the -- all of the
 22 language -- the most recent is in Hubbell. There's the
 23 discussion about the fact that the Fifth Amendment
 24 covers -- the values of the Fifth Amendment covers
 25 everything from civil to administrative to bankruptcy

38 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 cases. The Arnstein case in 1923 talked about the Fifth
 2 Amendment protecting a bankrupt person in a bankruptcy
 3 proceeding, not even involving a criminal proceeding at
 4 all. So the extension of the Fifth Amendment goes to
 5 really the core values. We just don't force people to
 6 talk, and the State can't do it. And --
 7 QUESTION: Excuse me. I -- you -- you mean --
 8 you say it extends to a bankruptcy proceeding. You mean
 9 you can refuse to provide testimony that can be used
 10 against you in a bankruptcy proceeding?
 11 MR. PAZ: That was the holding in Arnstein in --
 12 in 1923, and a bankrupt person who was under the
 13 bankruptcy proceeding simply said, I have a right to
 14 remain silent. I don't want to answer these questions. 
 15 The court upheld that right in the bankruptcy proceeding. 16 So early law certainly didn't -- didn't say it had --
 17 QUESTION: Simply because he didn't want to
 18 answer the questions, or because --
 19 MR. PAZ: They may --
 20 QUESTION: -- the -- the questions would
 21 incriminate him --
 22 MR. PAZ: That's correct.
 23 QUESTION: -- in a criminal proceeding. 
 24 MR. PAZ: That's correct.
 25 QUESTION: Well --

39 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. PAZ: But -- but there was no criminal
 2 proceeding --
 3 QUESTION: Well -- yes. There wasn't any yet
 4 pending. I mean, I think we all understand that you --
 5 that you acquire some pre-trial Fifth Amendment rights
 6 to -- to remain silent, but whether that means that there
 7 has been a Fifth Amendment violation before the entrance
 8 is -- evidence is introduced in trial is -- is a separate
 9 question. 
 10 MR. PAZ: I --
 11 QUESTION: Nobody questions that -- that there
 12 are some aspects of our Fifth Amendment law which -- which
 13 allow you to plead the Fifth Amendment before the evidence
 14 has been introduced in trial.
 15 MR. PAZ: 
 And -- and once the -- the right has 16 been given to the -- to the American people to plead the
 17 Fifth Amendment in any pre-trial proceeding, including
 18 an -- an interrogation at -- after a -- after a shooting
 19 such as this, and after the person is the sole suspect of
 20 a horrible crime, then obviously that is part of the
 21 criminal case. That is part of the entire criminal
 22 process. 
 23 If we would say we only have a Fifth Amendment
 24 right to remain silent if we introduce it into a court --
 25 into a court proceeding, then Mr. -- persons like

40 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Mr. Martinez who were never charged with a crime would
 2 have no remedy.
 3 QUESTION: But it doesn't have to be part of the
 4 criminal case. I mean, as -- as your bankruptcy example
 5 indicates. 
 6 MR. PAZ: I agree. I agree, Justice Scalia.
 7 I think it's important that we try to focus on
 8 what really are the bright lines here. We have three
 9 bright lines that were violated by -- by Sergeant Chavez
 10 in this case. The first is clearly coercion that goes
 11 back to -- to the early cases. 
 12 The second bright line is that there was --
 13 there was an invocation in this case. Mr. Martinez twice
 14 said, I don't want to talk. Leave me alone until they
 15 give me medical treatment.
 16 There was invocations implicitly. When he first
 17 opened his mouth, he says, leave me alone. Leave me
 18 alone. I'm dying. Those are the first words out of his
 19 mouth. That's an invocation. No reasonable police
 20 officer, no -- no basically trained police officer could
 21 believe that questioning a fellow in his condition was
 22 permissible.
 23 QUESTION: This -- this question is somewhat
 24 like Justice Scalia's question. Suppose the same facts so
 25 far as the hospital was concerned, but that the -- that

41 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the incident involved a kidnapping and the injured person,
 2 your client, was a witness to the kidnapping. We wanted
 3 to know what the kidnapper looked like so we could get the
 4 child back. 
 5 MR. PAZ: Then it's clearly -- he's not a
 6 suspect. Clearly, it -- questioning is -- is obviously
 7 needed. It's necessary. Of course. But -- but --
 8 QUESTION: Well, if -- if the questioning -- and
 9 suppose he says, go away, I'm sick, I'm sick. And they
 10 said, no, no, we want your answer. Why is there coercion
 11 in -- no coercion in that case --
 12 MR. PAZ: Because he's --
 13 QUESTION: -- but coercion in your case? 
 14 MR. PAZ: Because he's not a suspect. Because
 15 he's -- he isn't the sole --
 16 QUESTION: But that's -- that's a Miranda
 17 question. 
 18 MR. PAZ: I think not. 
 19 QUESTION: And -- and it's a -- well, it's also
 20 a basic Fifth Amendment question. 
 21 MR. PAZ: It is. 
 22 QUESTION: But why isn't -- why isn't the
 23 element of coercion the same in each case?
 24 MR. PAZ: Because the -- the constitutional
 25 obligation. When the person is a suspect, the

42 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 constitutional obligation rises above. That's the
 2 difference. 
 3 QUESTION: Well, that -- for purposes of a
 4 damage action, not for purposes of Miranda, or what's
 5 admissible. But for purposes of a Miranda action, should
 6 a suspect be in a better position than a totally innocent
 7 witness insofar as the police beating him up is concerned?
 8 MR. PAZ: No, I would think not. 
 9 QUESTION: No. All right. Well, if they're --
 10 if they're the same, then I -- I guess it would be --
 11 you'd get to the same result. If they had beaten him up
 12 or been coercive, it should be the same problem whether
 13 he's the witness or the suspect. And if they've gone past
 14 whatever point is reasonable, I guess there should be
 15 damages. 
 And if they're doing it for a good reason 16 because they want to stop an attack or something, well,
 17 that's just the way it is. And -- and that's -- I'm
 18 trying to figure out if that's what the law is and what
 19 the right words are to get to that place and how you deal
 20 with this mass of -- of constitutional rules, if -- if
 21 that's the proper result. 
 22 MR. PAZ: I think the proper result is -- is
 23 given -- given Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, the proper
 24 result is if this is a -- a witness who has information
 25 about some exigent circumstance, then there -- the Fifth

43 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Amendment doesn't attach at all. And obviously the
 2 officer is not going to use leading questions, coercive
 3 questions to get information. The basic concept of
 4 getting information under those circumstances is you want
 5 it to be trustworthy. You don't want the officer putting
 6 words into the person's mouth and brow-beating them to
 7 come up with something that's a bad lead. So obviously we
 8 want to have the kind of questioning that would be, in
 9 fact, seeking the truth as opposed to putting words into
 10 someone's mouth as what occurred in this case. 
 11 The -- I'd like to address a point that's been
 12 raised, and -- and it may not be totally necessary. I'd
 13 just like to make the distinction that the -- the basis,
 14 the entire heart of the discussion that coercion is
 15 somehow permissible unless the cases are introduced into a 16 criminal case or into a criminal trial are -- are the --
 17 the immunity cases. 
 18 In the immunity cases, they -- they -- I believe
 19 that the defense has -- or that the petitioners have
 20 totally confused the grant of immunity and coercion in a
 21 public trial after a grant of immunity where a person is
 22 told, you must answer the questions. And -- and the
 23 distinctions is one is an inquisitional situation where if
 24 the officer has a person alone and they're forcing them to
 25 answer questions, there is no public trial, there is no

44 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 judge there to make sure that they're -- they're not
 2 being -- there is no overreaching, there is no brow-
 3 beating. The person who was even under a grant of
 4 immunity can say, I'm not going to talk, and face the
 5 consequences of going to jail and sit in jail with dignity
 6 and say, I'm not going to talk. I believe that it's more
 7 important to assert my right not to speak than to be --
 8 than -- than sitting in jail. Our law still doesn't allow
 9 the court or the jailers to use coercion to extract their
 10 statement. A person in this country still could have the
 11 dignity to say I don't want to speak and I'll take the
 12 punishment, and if it's just punishment, that it's been
 13 done by a court, then that is not coercion, the kind of
 14 inquisitional coercion that this -- that this Court and
 15 the United States has always said we don't tolerate. 16 Are there any other questions? 
 17 QUESTION: Going back to your earlier
 18 distinction between the suspect and a witness, if someone
 19 is suspected of kidnapping a child, and that child is not
 20 going to live without some medication -- I believe this
 21 example was brought up in one of the briefs -- and the
 22 suspect, whatever answer, will certainly be incriminating,
 23 the police may not exercise any coercion to get the
 24 suspected kidnapper to tell where the child is so the
 25 child could get life-saving medication?

45 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. PAZ: I believe that there can be some
 2 questioning, and I think that the questioning has to be --
 3 even if it's forceful questioning, there must be limits. 
 4 And it's -- certainly it's a balance because it has to
 5 take into account what is the circumstance of this person.
 6 The danger in saying I agree with that
 7 hypothetical, Your Honor, is that what if the person is
 8 the wrong person. What if the suspect really isn't the
 9 person who kidnapped the person? What if they're just
 10 wrong and they got the wrong person? That's the danger,
 11 and that's why we have to --
 12 QUESTION: And on the other side is -- is the
 13 life of a child. 
 14 MR. PAZ: That's correct. And it's -- it's
 15 always a difficult choice, but we have -- we have to -16 QUESTION: -- it's difficult at all if they know
 17 that this is the fellow that did the -- they have all
 18 sorts of evidence. They know this is the guy that -- that
 19 buried the child, or deprived the child of medication or
 20 whatever. It's not a hard question at all.
 21 MR. PAZ: Then I think -- I think that there
 22 is -- we have to look at Quarles for guidance and, again,
 23 it has to be the degree of the -- the degree of coercion
 24 that is permissible. It's difficult to say that any
 25 coercion is permissible. But again, given -- with the

46 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 limited hypothetical and limited facts, it's -- it's
 2 difficult to make a judgment at this point.
 3 QUESTION: Mr. Paz, what do you -- what do you
 4 do with the Murphy case that's relied upon so extensively
 5 by -- by Mr. Robbins? As I understand that case, it was a
 6 State legislative commission which accorded immunity to
 7 the witness under State law, but of course could not
 8 accord immunity under Federal law. And we held that the
 9 witness, nonetheless, had to testify, and we said, of
 10 course, if the feds try to use the evidence, it will not
 11 be admissible because it was -- it was obtained under
 12 coercion. But we, nonetheless, allowed the State to
 13 compel the testimony. Now, were we allowing a Fifth
 14 Amendment violation?
 15 MR. PAZ: No, Your Honor. 
 That -- that was, as 16 I understood, that the -- the use immunity that was
 17 granted in -- in Waterfront was extensive with the
 18 privilege. It was allowed -- that is, as I understand the
 19 reading of the case, was that the privilege that -- that
 20 the -- the immunity that was granted was sufficient to
 21 cover both any State prosecution as well as Federal
 22 prosecution.
 23 QUESTION: No, no, no. That wasn't the case. 
 24 That was the whole problem. The State could not grant
 25 immunity from Federal prosecution. It -- it granted

47 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 immunity only from State prosecution. And we said,
 2 nonetheless, the State could -- could lock the person up
 3 until he testified. And the only consequence would be
 4 that if he did testify, it would not be introducible in
 5 Federal trial because it -- it had been coerced.
 6 Now, I -- you know, it's a bizarre case, but it
 7 does seem to stand for the principle that Mr. Robbins
 8 asserts, which is that there's no Fifth Amendment
 9 violation until the evidence is introduced.
 10 MR. PAZ: We all make mistakes, Your Honor. 
 11 (Laughter.) 
 12 QUESTION: You think -- you think that was one
 13 of our mistakes. 
 14 (Laughter.) 
 15 QUESTION: 
 Did you -- did you come up anywhere 16 in your -- in your research on this with anything that
 17 suggests that -- that once the person is a suspect, and
 18 once he's in custody of the police, that the criminal case
 19 has begun?
 20 MR. PAZ: Yes.
 21 QUESTION: Or is it clear that that isn't? Is
 22 it clear that the criminal case that the Constitution
 23 refers to is -- is not really begun until it's what we'd
 24 call technically is a criminal case, the filing, you know,
 25 indictment, or -- et cetera? 

48 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. PAZ: I -- I think there was good language
 2 in -- in Colorado versus Connelly. Justice O'Connor wrote
 3 a concurring opinion I think that covers the point quite
 4 well that said that -- and there was also the --
 5 QUESTION: It says that -- what? That the
 6 criminal case had begun at the time he was in custody?
 7 MR. PAZ: As I recall, the -- the discussion was
 8 that there had been an argument that the -- that Mosley's
 9 statement -- that that by using Mosley's statement,
 10 because there had been no police coercion, that it was
 11 permissible because the purpose of the -- of the rights,
 12 the Fifth Amendment, was to prevent police misconduct and
 13 coercion. And -- and in that context there was a -- there
 14 was a discussion about -- that the -- that the -- that
 15 there was -- that because the rights protect outside of 16 the criminal case and outside of the trial, that there was
 17 no -- there would be no deterrence. There would be no
 18 reason to enforce it at that point. 
 19 Also there was Michigan versus Tucker. Both
 20 Michigan and -- and Colorado versus Colony -- Connelly
 21 both discuss about a two-part inquiry. Should -- should
 22 we -- and the Court indicates in both of those cases that
 23 there's an analysis of whether the police officer conduct
 24 violated the Fifth Amendment, and then secondly, what is
 25 the remedy. So really, those two cases talk about the

49 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 difference between the right pre-trial in the custodial
 2 interrogation setting, as well as -- as does Miranda, and
 3 the difference between the remedies that the court
 4 considered.
 5 Any further questions? 
 6 Thank you. 
 7 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Paz.
 8 Mr. Robbins, you have, I think it's, 3 minutes.
 9 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS
 10 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 11 MR. ROBBINS: Thank you, Mr. -- Justice Stevens.
 12 Let me just quickly make a couple of points. 
 13 It seems to me that petitioner can win this case
 14 the hard way or the easy way. The easy way is recognizing
 15 that this body of law is, as one of the members said this 16 morning, a complex of constitutional issues with cross
 17 currents that cut in a variety of directions, that in
 18 light of Verdugo Urquidez, in light of Sacramento against
 19 Lewis, it cannot be said that any of these constitutional
 20 principles was sufficiently clearly established to warrant
 21 the rejection of qualified immunity. But I want to win it
 22 the hard way. 
 23 First, because under Sacramento against Lewis,
 24 the standard for substantive due process is intent to
 25 harm. That wasn't pled. That wasn't tried. There's no

50 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 such argument before you today. No one thinks that if
 2 Sacramento against Lewis applies, there can be a
 3 substantive due process claim at all. That's why it
 4 wasn't in the complaint. And no one here before you is
 5 suggesting intent to harm. 
 6 Now, on the Fifth Amendment, Justice Kennedy,
 7 I'd like to take one more crack at the concern that you've
 8 articulated because I think it is -- it is in fact
 9 possible to square those concerns with the holding in
 10 Murphy against Waterfront Commission which, as far as I
 11 can tell, is perfectly good law and consistent with what
 12 this Court said in footnote 8 of Balsys about the fail-
 13 safe of use immunity provided directly by the Fifth
 14 Amendment. So long as the government has not compromised
 15 the availability of use immunity under the Fifth 16 Amendment, there hasn't been a Fifth Amendment violation.
 17 In each of the penalty cases that are suggested
 18 by your hypothetical, that's what the government has done. 
 19 They have said to the witness, you may not have immunity. 
 20 You may not assert your Fifth Amendment. If you assert
 21 your Fifth Amendment right, we're going to put you in
 22 lock-up right now. The Court has consistently said, you
 23 know, if you forfeit the use immunity and actually put a
 24 guy in jail because he insists on it, that's as good as
 25 use. That's a protection that stems from the Fifth

51 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Amendment itself. 
 2 And that's -- that explains all of the so-called
 3 penalty cases. The police -- the Garrity case in New
 4 Jersey, the two Lefkowitz cases out of New York. That
 5 explains -- what is, in fact, going on there is someone is
 6 being punished or penalized for the assertion of a
 7 privilege, including the right against use. 
 8 But as long as the fail-safe in the words --
 9 Justice Souter, that you used in -- in footnote 8 of
 10 Balsys, as long as the fail-safe of use immunity has not
 11 been compromised, as it has not been in this case, there
 12 is not yet a full Fifth Amendment violation, which can
 13 only happen when there's a use in a criminal case. 
 14 And that is exactly the point that this Court in
 15 Verdugo Urquidez said in the passage that the Ninth 16 Circuit decided to call dictum and ignore. That was a big
 17 mistake. And on that ground alone, it's the Fifth
 18 Amendment portion of its decision --
 19 QUESTION: But, Mr. Robbins, why couldn't -- why
 20 couldn't --
 21 MR. ROBBINS: -- that should be reversed at the
 22 first threshold.
 23 QUESTION: Why couldn't you view the continued
 24 questioning under the circumstances of this case as
 25 tantamount to punishment when you have locked somebody up

52 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 who won't answer questions? 
 2 MR. ROBBINS: Well, I -- I think because --
 3 well, for one thing, the availability of use immunity is
 4 still there. What you -- what I think it would -- what I
 5 think -- what I think it would amount to is continued
 6 coercion of a statement which arguably at some threshold,
 7 once you cross it, does indeed become too coercive to
 8 render the statement admissible. But that's when the
 9 Fifth Amendment fail-safe steps in and says, you may not
 10 use it. That would violate the Fifth Amendment. But
 11 because the fail-safe wasn't compromised in this case, as
 12 it was in the line of cases suggested by Justice Kennedy's
 13 hypothetical, there cannot be a Fifth Amendment, and we
 14 don't even have to reach the question of qualified
 15 immunity. 
 16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you very much,
 17 Mr. Robbins.
 18 The case is submitted.
 19 (Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the
 20 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
