1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:17 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument 4 now in Number 99-1848, Buckhannon Board and Care Home v. 5 The West Virginia Department of Health and Human 6 Resources. 7 Mr. Arceneaux. 8 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WEBSTER J. ARCENEAUX, III 9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 10 MR. ARCENEAUX: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 11 please the Court: 12 This case presents a simple issue, whether the 13 Fourth Circuit's decision in this case that a party is not 14 a prevailing party unless they obtain a judgment, consent 15 decree, or settlement is in accordance with this Court's 16 prior decisions and the intent of Congress in establishing 17 the term, prevailing party, in the Civil Rights Attorneys' 18 Fees Award Act of 1976, commonly referred to as section 19 1988, and the two statutes at issue in this case, the Fair 20 Housing Amendments Act, and the Americans With 21 Disabilities Act. 22 When Congress enacted all three of these fee23 shifting statutes, it did not condition an award of fees 24 only upon the result of a judgment, consent decree, or 25 settlement. In fact, nowhere in these --

1 QUESTION: Well, the language of the statutes in 2 each case, does it not, refers to prevailing party? 3 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, Your Honor, it does. 4 QUESTION: So we do have to be satisfied that 5 the person seeking fees is a prevailing party. 6 MR. ARCENEAUX: Absolutely. 7 QUESTION: And how is that to be determined 8 where the case is dismissed as moot? 9 MR. ARCENEAUX: Well, I think in that situation, 10 we have a declaration that the case is moot, so -- in this 11 particular case we had that as well -- and then we can 12 look and see under what is known as the catalyst theory, 13 whether that lawsuit caused the defendant to act to render 14 that suit moot. 15 QUESTION: I would have thought the language, 16 prevailing party, suggests something else, that there 17 ought to be some nominal damages, or some judgment, or 18 some indication that the person seeking fees did, in fact, 19 prevail in a judicial proceeding. 20 MR. ARCENEAUX: If we look just to the word, 21 prevail, I believe it is a broad word, and this is my 22 point. Congress didn't say prevail by judgment, consent 23 decree, or settlement, Congress said prevail, and I 24 believe that -25 QUESTION: But the term, prevailing party, has a

1 pretty well-established meaning in the law, doesn't it? 2 It means you prevailed by getting something in a lawsuit. 3 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, and I think that's a fine 4 way to put it. If I sued someone for damages I think is 5 an easy way to put it, if I sue them for $50,000, and they 6 hand me $50,000 and say, go dismiss this lawsuit, I don't 7 have a judgment, I don't have a consent decree, I don't 8 have a settlement, but I have the $50,000. 9 QUESTION: But that's not the way lawsuits are 10 ordinarily settled. If someone sues you for $50,000, you 11 will probably pay it, but you'll get a stipulation and 12 order dismissing the thing. It will be a matter of court 13 record -14 MR. ARCENEAUX: That's correct. 15 QUESTION: -- that it was dismissed not because 16 of mootness but because you're paid. 17 MR. ARCENEAUX: That's right, but -- and that's 18 the same thing in this situation, where, when I sue 19 somebody and I say, don't shut down my home, don't throw 20 the residents out of the home, and they say, okay, we 21 won't do that, now, I don't have a judgment, consent 22 decree, or settlement, but I have the same effect, the 23 same result as if they had handed me the $50,000. 24 QUESTION: But that's not what the statute says. 25 It says you have to be a prevailing party, and I think

1 prevailing obviously means prevailing in the lawsuit, 2 not -- it doesn't say the happy party, you know, the party 3 who goes away smiling. It says the prevailing party. I 4 think it means prevailing in the litigation, and to 5 prevail in the litigation there has to be something that 6 ties the result to the litigation, it seems to me -7 MR. ARCENEAUX: And -8 QUESTION: -- other than simply, it came out the 9 way the plaintiff would have liked. 10 MR. ARCENEAUX: And that is one of the factors 11 that is looked at, whether there is a causal relationship 12 between -13 QUESTION: But you would have to establish it. 14 It's not just a factor. You would have to show -15 MR. ARCENEAUX: Absolutely. 16 QUESTION: -- that the litigation caused the 17 result, caused, in this case, the homes to remain open, 18 even though they didn't have the -19 MR. ARCENEAUX: Absolutely, and that is what we 20 intend to do. We were not given our day in court, so to 21 speak, because we were not allowed to proceed with any 22 factual development of that, but we think that we have a 23 very strong case, and we will absolutely be able to 24 establish the causal relationship. 25 QUESTION: All right, suppose I sue my next-

1 door neighbor for making loud music at night and keeping 2 me awake, all right. He turns off the music, and I drop 3 the lawsuit. Why am I the prevailing party? I mean, we 4 both -- everybody agrees on the facts. I got exactly what 5 I wanted, but also there is no piece of paper in the suit 6 that says anything. All it says is, the suit is dropped. 7 Now, I think the Chief Justice and Justice 8 O'Connor and I wanted to know why that's a prevailing 9 party within the meaning of the word prevailing in this 10 statute. Nobody doubts you got what you wanted, but why 11 is that sufficient? 12 MR. ARCENEAUX: When you look to the prior 13 decisions of this Court, the definition of prevailing 14 party under the cases has been, they personally achieve 15 some of the benefits they sought in bringing the suit. 16 Their lawsuit completely changed the defendant's behavior 17 towards the plaintiffs, and in this case and in your 18 example -19 QUESTION: And those are cases in which there 20 was no piece of paper saying anything? 21 MR. ARCENEAUX: Sometimes there are settlement 22 agreements -23 QUESTION: No, but the question is, is there a 24 case which, the person got just what he wanted, but there 25 is no piece of paper saying anything in the lawsuit. All

1 there is, is that the plaintiff dropped it. 2 MR. ARCENEAUX: Right. I mean, this is a case 3 of first impression. There's not been a case from this 4 Court. 5 QUESTION: All right. 6 MR. ARCENEAUX: There are obviously numerous 7 cases in the courts of appeals. 8 QUESTION: Then we're back to my question. Why, 9 given this statute, is the word prevailing party here to 10 be interpreted to mean you are a prevailing party, even 11 though there is no piece of paper saying anything in the 12 lawsuit -13 MR. ARCENEAUX: Right. 14 QUESTION: -- but for a piece of paper that 15 says, I terminate the lawsuit? 16 MR. ARCENEAUX: Two reasons. 17 QUESTION: That's the basic question -18 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes. 19 QUESTION: -- in the case, and I want to hear 20 your answer. 21 MR. ARCENEAUX: Two reasons. First, because I 22 think it's consistent with the meaning of the word, 23 prevail, which can also mean persuade, induce, or 24 influence another to act, and second, because I believe 25 that's what Congress intended.

1 When one looks at the House report, for 2 instance, it says similarly, after a complaint is filed, 3 the defendant might voluntarily cease the unlawful 4 practice. A court might still award fees, even though it 5 may conclude as a matter of equity that no formal relief 6 such as injunction is needed, and the legislature then 7 cites to the decision of Parham v. Southwestern Bell 8 Telephone Company. 9 QUESTION: I'm sure every Member of Congress 10 read that case. They ran to their library and looked up 11 that case. You really think that anybody who voted for 12 that bill had the slightest idea what that case held? 13 MR. ARCENEAUX: I think that that -14 QUESTION: How many people do you think knew 15 what that case held? Two? You think -- I think two would 16 be an extravagant number. 17 MR. ARCENEAUX: I think that it is consistent -18 QUESTION: There is a presumption that we follow 19 that the Congresspeople know what the law is, isn't there? 20 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes. 21 QUESTION: We said that in some of our opinions. 22 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes. 23 QUESTION: Cannon, for example. 24 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, and I think that had 25 they --
9 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 QUESTION: Do they know what the court of 2 appeals law is? They know what the court of -- lower 3 courts have been holding as opposed to what this Court has 4 held? 5 QUESTION: The Marr case was a Supreme Court 6 case, wasn't it? 7 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, and this was section 1988. 8 where this Court had said in Alyeska that we were not 9 going to have attorney's fee award under what was called 10 the Private Attorney General, and so Congress intended to 11 have these type of civil rights lawsuits filed, and they 12 wanted to encourage these type of lawsuits. That's what 13 the language says, and this is what is under the 14 discussion of prevailing party, and so the issue is, is 15 that what Congress intended, we think that you can look to 16 the legislative history and to the plain meaning of the 17 terms, prevailing party, and say that yes, that is what is 18 intended here. 19 QUESTION: Mr. Arceneaux, in the event of 20 ambiguity, I am reluctant to read a term in a way that's 21 going to get courts into areas that it's very difficult 22 for them to maneuver in. 23 In the present case, you want the opportunity to 24 demonstrate below that an act of legislation, right -- I 25 mean, what happened was that the law was changed.

1 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes. 2 QUESTION: And you want to show that the 3 legislators who change the law were motivated by this 4 lawsuit. This is a very peculiar area for courts to be 5 functioning in, to try to figure out what prompted 6 legislators to enact a particular law. 7 I mean, would it be enough to be a catalyst, for 8 example, if one legislator found out about this lawsuit 9 and said, why, that's outrageous, that the law should be 10 that way. In other words, they weren't worried about 11 losing money. All they were worried about is, all the 12 lawsuit did was bring to their attention a disposition 13 that seemed to them outrageous, and so they said, let's 14 change the law. Is that enough to be a catalyst? 15 MR. ARCENEAUX: I do not think that we have to 16 make that inquiry, Your Honor. I think that while -17 QUESTION: Well, I'm happy to hear that. 18 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes. 19 QUESTION: But I'd like to know why. 20 MR. ARCENEAUX: And I will tell you, 21 Your Honor, because West Virginia is unique. It is unlike 22 the Federal Government or most States in that 23 administrative agencies cannot promulgate regulations. We 24 don't think that the inquiry in this case, the facts rule 25 investigation that we're trying to establish here, will

1 involve the legislature whatsoever. Certainly we have no 2 intent, as one of the amici suggests, that we need to go 3 out and depose legislators. This is not going to be an 4 inquiry about a legislative activity. 5 QUESTION: What will you do? How will you prove 6 it? 7 MR. ARCENEAUX: We think that we have an 8 overwhelmingly strong case, because what happened here, we 9 took the deposition of the State fire marshal in March of 10 1997. He said that it was absolutely impossible for the 11 State of West Virginia to adopt this rule. Six to eight 12 weeks later, he changed his mind. He made the decision to 13 promulgate the rules and change the rules as we were 14 requesting in the lawsuit. What happened in that interim? 15 We took the deposition of Dr. Bernard Levin, who was the 16 expert who explained how the States had all abandoned the 17 position that he was taking. 18 QUESTION: But he had no authority to change the 19 rules. It had to be done by the legislature. 20 MR. ARCENEAUX: But he had to initiate the 21 process. 22 QUESTION: You said, I thought, that you 23 wouldn't have to deal with the legislature at all, but 24 here it had to be passed by the legislature. 25 MR. ARCENEAUX: That's correct, but we don't
12 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 believe that in looking at the causation analysis we need 2 to look at what the legislature did. It is not the 3 legislature that made the decision to change the rule. 4 QUESTION: Well, I'm amazed that you say that. 5 I would have thought that anything the legislature 6 enacted, you would say the legislature made a decision to 7 enact it. Do you think not? 8 MR. ARCENEAUX: Clearly they did, Your Honor. 9 QUESTION: Okay, well, how do you get from the 10 fire marshal's change of mind to the legislature's 11 legislation? What's the interim step? 12 MR. ARCENEAUX: The unique process of the 13 rulemaking process that's in West Virginia. These rules 14 are just all batched. Hundreds of agencies all -15 QUESTION: Just tell me what -- tell us what 16 happened in this case. What happened? What did the fire 17 marshal do? 18 MR. ARCENEAUX: And all of the exhibits that are 19 attached to our motion for attorney's fees has this all 20 documented in it. 21 QUESTION: Okay, but we want to know here and 22 now. 23 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes. The fire marshal changed 24 his mind, made a decision to promulgate these new rules. 25 He has to go to the fire commission and then the fire
13 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 commission presents it to the legislature. 2 QUESTION: Well, is that what he did? 3 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes. 4 QUESTION: Did he go to the fire commission and 5 said, I want to change these rules? 6 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes. 7 QUESTION: And the fire commission says, we 8 agree, we will change these rules? 9 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes. 10 QUESTION: And the fire commission then did 11 what? 12 MR. ARCENEAUX: Then the fire commission has to 13 promulgate the new rules, and then they submit them to the 14 legislature. 15 QUESTION: And what -16 MR. ARCENEAUX: There's a special committee. 17 QUESTION: Was the legislation that was passed 18 in effect the verbatim embodiment of what the fire 19 commission proposed? 20 MR. ARCENEAUX: I believe that to be the case, 21 and that is why I referred to the legislature in this 22 process as merely a rubber stamp. 23 QUESTION: Now, do you think the fire 24 commissioner changed his mind because he was afraid of 25 losing the lawsuit, or because he was persuaded that it
14 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 was a good idea? 2 MR. ARCENEAUX: We think he was motivated by the 3 lawsuit. 4 QUESTION: Can you prove that? Is there any 5 possible way of proving it? 6 MR. ARCENEAUX: Well, as some of the courts have 7 noted -- I don't know what is in his mind. 8 QUESTION: Exactly. That's the problem. 9 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes. 10 QUESTION: What if your lawsuit -- what if he 11 had nothing to do with the lawsuit. It may be against his 12 agency, but he happens to read about the lawsuit in the 13 paper and he says, this -- what, this is an outrageous 14 thing. You mean, that's what our rules say? And then, 15 motivated by your lawsuit, okay, he does the same thing 16 you said he's done here and gets the rule changed. Does 17 that make your case a catalyst? I guess it does, in a 18 sense. 19 MR. ARCENEAUX: Well, we have two distinctions 20 that I would draw. One is, he knew about the case, and he 21 was deposed in the case. He was active. He attended 22 every deposition, so it's not like he's sitting back in 23 his office, okay, and the -- I've lost my second point, 24 but also there is this intervening deposition of our 25 expert that he's in attendance and he hears what they have
15 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 to say. 2 Unlike the regular -3 QUESTION: Instead of reading it in the paper. 4 I mean, what difference would that -- I don't see what 5 difference it makes. 6 MR. ARCENEAUX: Well, most of the cases that 7 I've seen where they talk about the legislature -- and 8 there are some cases that are simple. Some cases they 9 have found, and it's right there in the legislative 10 history, they enacted this provision -- Paris is an 11 example, where they say in the legislative history, we 12 don't have documented legislative history. What we're 13 saying is, there should not be a per se rule just when the 14 legislature acts that we cannot then present our evidence. 15 The second thing is, unlike a lot of the 16 legislative cases, when they talk about the legislative 17 cases they talk about intervening causation, that here is 18 some third party that has taken the lawsuit away, the 19 legislature has acted. 20 We don't believe there's any intervening 21 causation here, because we were suing the fire commission 22 and the fire marshal, and they're the ones that made the 23 decision to change this. 24 QUESTION: Do you rely at all on your warding 25 off the cease and desist order?
16 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes. 2 QUESTION: Which, if you had done nothing would 3 have surely followed, and then you would have been the 4 object of an adverse judgment. 5 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, and we believe that we 6 prevailed. We were under cease and desist orders, and the 7 homes were going to be shut down, and all the residents 8 were going to be thrown out, and we presented expert 9 testimony -- these were clients that were 102 years old, 10 and that they could suffer transfer trauma just by the 11 very act of them being moved into another home. We went 12 in on a TRO. We were able to obtain an agreed order. 13 That agreed order remained in place for the duration of 14 the litigation, and no one was ever thrown out of the 15 home. The homes were never shut down. 16 QUESTION: Well, my goodness, you don't become a 17 prevailing party by getting a preliminary order just 18 leaving the status quo in effect while the case is being 19 adjudicated. I mean, is that all it takes to prevail? 20 MR. ARCENEAUX: We think that it is part. We 21 understand that it was only a interim relief. 22 QUESTION: Does it matter to your case whether 23 the fire -- whatever it is, the fire marshal's judgment, 24 or for that matter the legislature's judgment, was based 25 on the fact that they thought the law was outrageous, as
17 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 distinct from the fact that they may not have wanted to 2 take a hit by losing this case? Does it matter one way or 3 the other? 4 MR. ARCENEAUX: Well, we think that our lawsuit 5 brought that to their attention. 6 QUESTION: But that's not my question. Does it 7 matter, on your theory -8 MR. ARCENEAUX: I think we have to show -9 QUESTION: -- whether they simply said, we're 10 suddenly aware of the law and we think it's bad and it 11 ought to be changed, or on the other hand they say, we 12 think the law is great, but we don't want to lose this 13 lawsuit, so we're going to change the law? Does it matter 14 to your case? 15 MR. ARCENEAUX: I think that it would relate to 16 the causal relationship. We do recognize that we would 17 have to establish a causal relationship, so in your one we 18 may not be able to do so. 19 QUESTION: But why isn't -20 MR. ARCENEAUX: Your Honor -21 QUESTION: Why isn't -- each case why isn't 22 there a causal relationship? That's what I don't 23 understand. I think he's trying to help you, in other 24 words. I don't think you realize that. 25 QUESTION: I really was.

1 (Laughter.) 2 MR. ARCENEAUX: Maybe I'm -3 QUESTION: I'm with you. I think he was trying 4 to hurt you. 5 (Laughter.) 6 MR. ARCENEAUX: Maybe I was just distracted by 7 the light. I was going to -8 QUESTION: Isn't there causation in either case? 9 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes. 10 QUESTION: The one cause, the lawsuit brings it 11 to the attention, but for the lawsuit it would not have 12 come to the attention, it wouldn't have been changed. 13 In the other case, there's a different chain of 14 causation, but it's still the same causation. They say, 15 in order to avoid losing, we get rid of the lawsuit. Is 16 causation in each case? 17 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, I agree. 18 QUESTION: Then why not, just reading about it 19 in the papers, the legislators read about this lawsuit, 20 and but for this lawsuit they would never have known about 21 this outrageous law, and that's enough, right? 22 MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes. We think -23 QUESTION: The fire marshal had nothing to do 24 with it. He never ran to the legislature. They just read 25 about it in the paper.
19 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 MR. ARCENEAUX: That would be a different case. 2 QUESTION: I know it would be a different case, 3 but why would it be different as far as your claim is 4 concerned? 5 MR. ARCENEAUX: We think as long as we have the 6 opportunity to establish causation we should be able to do 7 so. 8 QUESTION: And that's causation. They would not 9 have known about this thing except, because of your 10 lawsuit, it gets in the papers. They read about it, they 11 think, gee, that's a stupid law, let's change it. 12 MR. ARCENEAUX: Your Honor, may I reserve the 13 remainder of my time for rebuttal? 14 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Arceneaux. 15 Ms. Brinkmann, we'll hear from you. 16 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN 17 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 18 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 19 MS. BRINKMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 20 please the Court: 21 The categorical rule adopted by the court of 22 appeals that allows fees only in a case where there is a 23 judgment, consent decree, or settlement, is contrary to 24 the text, history, and purpose of the civil rights fee25 shifting statutes. That rule would deny fees in the most

1 meritorious case that directly obtains all of the relief 2 sought in that case if the defendant on the eve of trial 3 complies with the demand without a court order. 4 QUESTION: In this case, was the matter moot as 5 a matter of Article III jurisdiction, so the judge had no 6 choice, or would the judge have had some discretion to 7 retain jurisdiction to enter some sort of declaratory 8 relief? 9 MS. BRINKMANN: It appears, Your Honor, that it 10 was, in fact, moot because of a legislative change under 11 this Court's standards in Laidlaw and City of Mesquite. 12 There's such a minuscule likelihood that that law would be 13 changed back. 14 The plaintiff did contest mootness at the trial 15 court level -16 QUESTION: I take it the usual rule is that it 17 must be absolutely clear that the alleged wrongful conduct 18 cannot recur before the case can be dismissed, is that the 19 way the rule works? 20 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, for mootness, Your Honor. 21 That's under the Laidlaw case from last term and also the 22 City of Mesquite case, that's correct. 23 QUESTION: Could the plaintiff here have asked 24 for nominal damages in order to keep the case alive? 25 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, because this is

1 Ex parte Young case against State officials enforcing a 2 law. 3 QUESTION: Oh, okay. 4 MS. BRINKMANN: That's often the situation. 5 Also, there are several statutes that we cite in a 6 footnote of our brief that limit relief in civil rights 7 cases to injunctive relief, and those are often the most 8 important kinds of cases that the fee-shifting statutes 9 are intended to get at, where a plaintiff has a 10 meritorious claim for injunctive relief to enforce a civil 11 rights law, but does not have the money to pay an 12 attorney, and no possibility of a damages relief that 13 could perhaps pay those attorneys' fees. 14 The court of appeals' categorical rule 15 undermines that. 16 QUESTION: Ms. Brinkmann, what if I were a 17 member of the West Virginia legislature and I know this 18 suit has been pending for a long time, and they have hired 19 very expensive lawyers to sue the State, there's a lot of 20 money involved, and I would really -- I think this is a 21 dumb law that's on the books, and I would really like to 22 change that law, but then the fire marshal comes to me and 23 he says, you know, if you change that law, the State is 24 going to be liable for millions of dollars in attorneys' 25 fees, because it will be held that the suit was the

1 catalyst for the change, and we'll have to pay all this 2 money. 3 Why would we want to distort the legislative 4 process in West Virginia by making a change in the law 5 that the members of the legislature think desirable costly 6 because of the existence of a lawsuit, even though the 7 State believes it can win the lawsuit? 8 MS. BRINKMANN: A couple of -9 QUESTION: They don't think they're going to 10 lose. They just say, if we change the law because it's a 11 bad law, we're going to have to pay all this money in 12 attorneys' fees. 13 MS. BRINKMANN: A couple of responses, Your 14 Honor. First of all, I just want to make clear that, of 15 course, the catalyst rule does not just apply to 16 legislative change, and also a point I want to get to 17 later that it also applies in settlements and consent 18 decree cases, but talking about the application of that to 19 a situation in which there is a legislative change that 20 would -- the legislature would want to make as a matter of 21 policy, there are several approaches that the defendant 22 has available. 23 First of all, the defendant has it within his 24 control, if they make that decision promptly, to avoid the 25 build-up of attorneys' fees. Indeed, that's what often
23 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 happens in Government cases. The most meritorious of 2 claim may come in. There may be a settlement within a 3 week. 4 QUESTION: I understand. 5 MS. BRINKMANN: In addition to that, the 6 defendant is able to defend against the causation and the 7 merits issue in this type of litigation. For example, if 8 the legislature has another reason, they were already 9 considering it, policy reasons, the plaintiff will not be 10 able to establish causation. 11 QUESTION: Do you have to show, in order to 12 establish the causation you're talking about, that the 13 legislature made the change because it knew it would lose 14 the lawsuit? Is that a condition, you have to show that 15 the legislature made the change because it realized that 16 its law was contrary to Federal law? 17 MS. BRINKMANN: No. You would have to show that 18 the claim was not meritless. Our proposition is -19 QUESTION: Ah, well -20 MS. BRINKMANN: -- that you would have to show 21 that the merit -- that -22 QUESTION: So they could have changed it for a 23 reason that has nothing to do with their -- with the 24 lawsuit, except that the lawsuit brought the matter to 25 their attention, even though they weren't worried about
24 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 losing the lawsuit. 2 MS. BRINKMANN: That would not -3 QUESTION: They knew they could win the lawsuit. 4 MS. BRINKMANN: That would not establish the 5 causation requirement, and I want to -6 QUESTION: Wait, that -- it -7 QUESTION: Why wouldn't it, Ms. Brinkmann? 8 MS. BRINKMANN: Because it would not establish 9 that that change was made as a result of the lawsuit. 10 There's two aspects of the causation, Mr. Chief 11 Justice. There's the causation as a matter of fact, but 12 then there's also the question more of a proximate 13 causation, that that change has to be because of the 14 claim, not because of the nuisance value of the lawsuit, 15 for example. That's why there is -- the lower courts have 16 always applied the type of frivolousness standard, and we 17 suggest it should be a standard where you state a claim 18 upon which relief could be granted. 19 And if I could, Your Honor, I want to really 20 make the point clear that that is the same standard the 21 courts currently, and have for a long time, applied to 22 cases involving consent decrees and settlements. There's 23 no reason to treat this case differently because -24 QUESTION: Well, except that the statute says, 25 prevailing party, and it's quite logical, I think, to read
25 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 the term, prevailing party, as meaning that you should 2 have something to show from the lawsuit itself. 3 MS. BRINKMANN: And you do have something to 4 show in these cases. You obtained the relief that you 5 sought. In this particular case, you have a law to 6 enforce, a regulation to enforce -7 QUESTION: Yes, but it's not a part of any 8 decree. 9 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, and in a 10 settlement, it is very analogous to a settlement and a 11 consent decree. 12 QUESTION: Yes, but except that a typical 13 settlement, you'll get some document from the court. 14 MS. BRINKMANN: But it's simply a contract, Your 15 Honor, just as the law here, a separate lawsuit would have 16 to be brought to enforce that, in fact, under this Court's 17 opinion in Kincannon, it's not even clear there would be a 18 Federal cause of action to enforce that. 19 Moreover, even -20 QUESTION: If you get a settlement approved by 21 the court, the court will enforce that settlement, won't 22 it? 23 MS. BRINKMANN: As your opinion explains -24 QUESTION: So you really have to prevail. You 25 have some judicial power behind that contract. It's just
26 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 a contract, but this is one that the Court is behind. 2 MS. BRINKMANN: But, Your Honor, it depends. If 3 the court incorporates that, otherwise you just have a 4 contract. You have to go prove the validity of that 5 contract. Here, they have a cease and desist order that 6 was pending against them before the lawsuit that can no 7 longer be enforced. They have a statute and a regulation 8 they can enforce. 9 I also want to point out that in both the 10 consent decree and settlement situations, there is no 11 requirement of a determination of any violation of law, 12 any determination of liability. In fact, as this Court 13 repeatedly has recognized, that's one of the motivations 14 for settlements, consent decrees, to be able to resolve 15 the case without an admission of liability. 16 QUESTION: Ms. Brinkmann, correct me if I'm 17 wrong, I think there's a difference between your position 18 and Mr. Arceneaux's. As I understood his argument, it 19 would be enough if the legislature learned about this bad 20 law through the lawsuit, and you insist that the 21 legislature must have changed the law because it was 22 worried about losing the lawsuit? 23 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, I'm sorry. 24 QUESTION: No? 25 MS. BRINKMANN: I must have misspoken.
27 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 QUESTION: Okay. 2 MS. BRINKMANN: I thought your question to me 3 was a situation in which there were other policy reasons 4 that the legislature had taken into account to change the 5 law. If the lawsuit is a factual causation for the 6 relief, the relief is something that the plaintiff sought, 7 and if the claim is not meritless, that does meet the 8 standard for -9 QUESTION: Even if the legislature just read 10 about it in the newspapers? 11 MS. BRINKMANN: If it -12 QUESTION: That's a factual predicate. That's 13 how they learned about it, and it was not a meritless 14 lawsuit, and that's all that's needed? 15 MS. BRINKMANN: If the lawsuit brought that 16 about. I have to emphasize -17 QUESTION: We'd have to read the Palzgraf case 18 in order for this all to work out? 19 (Laughter.) 20 MS. BRINKMANN: Proximate causation does come to 21 mind, Your Honor, when we talk about the fact that it 22 cannot be a frivolous or a meritless claim -23 QUESTION: But it sounds like but-for causation, 24 not proximate cause, that you're talking about. 25 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, I think, Your Honor,
28 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 that -2 QUESTION: Why wouldn't that enable an astute 3 lawyer to kind of spot administrative or legislative 4 changes in the offing and file some suit so they can run 5 in and get some kind of attorney's fees? 6 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, the lower courts 7 have rejected just those types of claims -8 QUESTION: You don't object to tough causation 9 requirements? 10 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor. 11 QUESTION: All right. 12 MS. BRINKMANN: We believe that that's the 13 meaning of the statute -14 QUESTION: And you respect Justice Scalia's 15 practical point, which I thought was correct, isn't it? 16 It's a correct point that sometimes the legislature would 17 be in just the situation he mentioned. I wonder if that's 18 neatly counterbalanced by what I would think would be a 19 worse problem the other way, namely, the plaintiff has to 20 fight to the last ditch, because if -- he can never 21 settle, because if he doesn't push his most unreasonable 22 claim, he won't get any attorneys' fees. 23 MS. BRINKMANN: Exactly, Your Honor. 24 QUESTION: That also is a practical problem, 25 isn't it?
29 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 MS. BRINKMANN: Exactly, Your Honor. 2 QUESTION: Is it a practical problem also for 3 the legislature to be caught in what I'd call a formal 4 settlement, with a Government department? I've seen a few 5 of those, and if the only way you get attorneys' fees is 6 to force the court to enter some kind of complex 7 settlement decree, is it clear what happens later in State 8 government? I mean, I've seen an awful lot where the 9 legislature feels bound by a settlement decree of private 10 parties, with a separate -- do you see my problem? I 11 don't know if it's a practical problem, but I'd like you 12 to comment on it. 13 MS. BRINKMANN: I'm not sure I understand your 14 question. 15 QUESTION: If you recover only if a there's a 16 piece of paper called, settlement, that means there are 17 words on a piece of paper -18 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes. 19 QUESTION: -- filed in court, those words can 20 sometimes extend to thousands of pages, and legislatures 21 and Governments don't like to be subject to such decrees. 22 MS. BRINKMANN: That's absolutely correct, and 23 this is the most efficient -- may I respond to that -24 QUESTION: No, I think that's enough, Ms. 25 Brinkmann.

1 MS. BRINKMANN: Thank you, Your Honor. 2 QUESTION: We'll hear from you, Mr. Cleek. 3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID P. CLEEK 4 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 5 MR. CLEEK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 6 the Court: 7 Let me say at the outset I want to respond to a 8 couple of the remarks that have been made in the arguments 9 by counsel for the United States and also for the 10 petitioner's counsel. It was an inaccuracy, and I'm 11 certain an inadvertent inaccuracy, by counsel that this is 12 an Ex parte Young situation where you only have injunctive 13 relief requested. There was actually a demand in this 14 case for punitive damages and compensatory damages, and 15 that claim was voluntarily dropped by the plaintiff. 16 Now, in response to Justice Kennedy's 17 question -18 QUESTION: May I just ask for a clarification? 19 I thought that to the extent that the action was against 20 the State, it couldn't be brought, you couldn't get 21 damages. The only thing you could get against the State 22 was injunctive relief. 23 MR. CLEEK: That's right. The damage claims 24 would have been against the individuals in their personal 25 capacities.
31 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 QUESTION: And is -- that would be rather 2 strange, wouldn't it, to say these officials, who were 3 clearly acting in their official capacity in having a fire 4 code and a cease and desist order, that they were doing 5 something in their personal capacities? 6 MR. CLEEK: I believe, Your Honor, that that's 7 the only way a damage claim could have been returned in 8 this case, in view of the rule of the Eleventh Amendment, 9 and nonetheless those claims were made, punitive and 10 compensatory damage claims were made in the original 11 complaint and the amended complaint. 12 I should also point out to the Court that, with 13 regard to the issue of the -14 QUESTION: And on what ground were they 15 dismissed? 16 MR. CLEEK: They were dismissed by a voluntary 17 action of the plaintiff. I don't know the motivation for 18 that. 19 QUESTION: You hadn't put in a defense to it? 20 MR. CLEEK: To the damage claims? 21 QUESTION: Yes. 22 MR. CLEEK: Those had not been addressed, Your 23 Honor. As a matter of fact, as I recall, with regard to 24 the discovery in this case, the only people who had been 25 deposed were two persons from the fire commission, the

1 fire marshal and an assistant, and some experts. 2 QUESTION: I mean, an answer. I mean, you said 3 they made a complaint that included a request for punitive 4 damages and compensatory damages -5 MR. CLEEK: Yes, Your Honor. 6 QUESTION: -- against the defendants. 7 Defendants put an answer in -8 MR. CLEEK: Yes, ma'am. 9 QUESTION: -- to that claim? 10 MR. CLEEK: Yes, Your Honor. 11 QUESTION: And what was the answer? 12 MR. CLEEK: We denied that there was -- it was a 13 denial that there were any damages due. 14 QUESTION: On what ground, because this was a 15 claim about State action. 16 MR. CLEEK: There was an Eleventh Amendment 17 defense asserted, but with regard to those damage claims, 18 I assumed, from reading the complaint, that they were 19 against individuals in their personal capacity, otherwise 20 they couldn't be returnable against the State. 21 QUESTION: I don't want to deflect you on this, 22 but to the extent that they were seeking injunctive relief 23 it was a pure Ex parte Young case? 24 MR. CLEEK: Yes, Your Honor, that's correct, and 25 let me respond for a moment about the issue about the

1 intrusion into legislative prerogative here that this 2 catalyst theory may engender. 3 Mr. Arceneaux, the petitioner's counsel, on page 4 44 and 45 of the initial brief in this case, sets out that 5 if he is entitled to review in front of the district 6 court, some theory under the catalyst theory that he's -7 he motivated by his lawsuit the State to take some 8 voluntary action here, he suggests in his initial brief 9 that the legislative enactment would be part of his 10 inquiry. 11 In his reply brief, for the first time, he 12 suggests that that's not going to happen, and that it's 13 going to be an agency issue, and the legislature will not 14 be addressed. For the first time in the reply brief we 15 also find that petitioners have suggested that they 16 prevailed because they got this agreed order. That's 17 never been a demand to the district court for attorneys' 18 fees in any case. 19 QUESTION: Mr. Cleek, Mr. Arceneaux was queried 20 extensively about some of the practical problems with his 21 position. What about the practical problems with yours? 22 What do you do about the agency that is really guilty as 23 sin, and they're going to lose this case. They know 24 they're going to lose it, so after dancing the plaintiff 25 around for several years, causing great expense in
34 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 attorneys' fees, when the case is about to come up for 2 judgment, they just fold, and revise the regulation that's 3 been under challenge -- don't enter a settlement, they 4 just revise the regulation that's under challenge. 5 MR. CLEEK: There are two means -6 QUESTION: Attorneys' fees payable? No. 7 MR. CLEEK: Two means to address that issue, 8 Your Honor. Firstly, if the district court decides that 9 the voluntary action that ceases whatever activity there 10 is -11 QUESTION: Yes. 12 MR. CLEEK: -- just enforcement of this 13 regulation, or whatever, does not moot the case, then you 14 can proceed to merits. 15 QUESTION: Oh, no, it moots the case. That's 16 why they do it. They do it to moot the case. 17 MR. CLEEK: In that case, that is the one area 18 in which it would appear that unless Congress has approved 19 the catalyst theory, assuming the catalyst theory is the 20 only means of addressing that mootness issue, unless 21 Congress has approved the catalyst theory, there's no 22 relief there. 23 QUESTION: Okay. 24 QUESTION: The problem goes one step further, 25 doesn't it, because we have indicated that settlements may
35 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 qualify, a settled case may have a prevailing party within 2 the meaning of the rule, and I would suppose that if you 3 prevail in any case in which the settlement would 4 otherwise give the plaintiff the relief that the plaintiff 5 was seeking, there just won't be any more settlements. 6 There will simply be the voluntary provision of the 7 relief, whether it be affirmative, or the cessation of 8 something the plaintiff is objecting to, and we're not 9 going to get any more settlement cases in instances in 10 which the plaintiff ends up getting what the plaintiff 11 wants. 12 MR. CLEEK: Your Honor, this Court has 13 recognized in Maher and Farrar as well, and also it's 14 indicated in the legislative history, that settlements 15 constitute prevailing party status. 16 Now, if your question is, if the State or any 17 governmental body can simply say, we're going to stop, and 18 not enter into an enforceable agreement, is that going to 19 prevent settlements? As a matter of judicial policy, of 20 course, settlements are preferred. Would it cut down on 21 them? There's the possibility, but I think -22 QUESTION: Well, it's not going to cut down on 23 settlements in which in effect they in some ways split the 24 difference, but when, in fact, you have a case that 25 traditionally would have resulted in a settlement, there
36 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 would be an orderly process, they'd sign a neither party 2 docket marking, whatever, and give it to the judge, the 3 judge would approve it, and the defendant agrees in that 4 kind -- in a settled case to provide exactly what the 5 plaintiff wants, there'll be no more settlements. 6 So it won't affect the split-the-difference 7 settlement, but it will affect the give-them-what-they8 ask-for settlement. 9 MR. CLEEK: It could affect, in candor, a 10 settlement where a regulation is involved or where a 11 policy is involved, because in that case it is arguable 12 that the governmental body could simply stop the conduct 13 and moot the case. 14 QUESTION: Well, how many settlements are you 15 aware of that are not split-the-difference settlements? I 16 mean, what advantage is there to entering into a 17 settlement if you're coughing up everything that the 18 plaintiff has asked for? 19 MR. CLEEK: Your Honor -20 QUESTION: In my experience, at least, when you 21 sign a settlement agreement you get something in exchange 22 for that settlement agreement. If you're just going to 23 cut and run, just cut and run and save the attorneys' fees 24 in drafting the settlement agreement. 25 MR. CLEEK: I have been litigating these cases
37 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 for 27 years, even before the Attorneys' Fees Act, and I 2 have not had the occasion to see any cases where they 3 weren't -4 QUESTION: Well, isn't this such a case? 5 QUESTION: You're in such a case. 6 QUESTION: Isn't this an example of that case? 7 MR. CLEEK: This is an example of it -8 QUESTION: The State totally abandoned its 9 position. 10 MR. CLEEK: Yes. It's an example of the worst 11 that can happen under a circumstance where there's an 12 argument, at least, to be made by someone who suggests 13 that there was a but-for element of the Government's 14 action that is related to the lawsuit. 15 This case that you have before you is the kind 16 of case that suggests that there ought to be some other 17 avenue to address a case where some voluntary action moots 18 the case. However, if Congress hasn't provided for that, 19 Justice Stevens, then it doesn't exist and, as the Court 20 pointed out earlier, if you connect these fee-shifting 21 statutes in any action a prevailing party may be entitled 22 to fees, it has to be within the action. We're talking 23 here, Your Honor, about a nonparty who takes the action. 24 QUESTION: Well, if you say -- if we're at that 25 point, that is, if you agree -- given your answer to
38 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 Justice Scalia I think you do agree that if you look at 2 the practicalities, for every bad thing you can find one 3 side you can find a bad thing the other side. We can 4 match example for example. Then you're back to the 5 language. 6 All right, what about the language? Prevailing 7 party covers their case literally. Then you have Farrar, 8 which favors you. Then you have, I take it, Hewitt, which 9 uses an example of where you could recover where there is, 10 quote, a change in conduct that redresses the plaintiff's 11 grievances, and then we have the statutory legislative 12 history where they define in the House report, prevailing 13 party, they say, a court should still award fees where, 14 after a complaint is filed, a defendant might voluntarily 15 cease the unlawful practice. 16 All right. Is that it? It seems to me we now 17 have the whole case, and you have to balance the 18 practicalities and decide whether you're going to give 19 credit to that House report. Is that right? 20 MR. CLEEK: Your Honor, you're quite right. The 21 House report refers to the voluntary cessation of an 22 unlawful act. Obviously, if Government quits a lawful 23 act, even if it's accused -- even if the allegation is 24 it's an improper act, then attorneys' fees would not be 25 appropriate. Where an unlawful act is used there, this
39 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 Court has repeatedly, from Hanrahan, to Hewitt, to Farrar, 2 said -- and Hewitt says this as well, by the use of 3 ordinary language, prevailing party means that you must 4 get some success on the merits. The catalyst theory 5 doesn't provide for that. 6 QUESTION: What about the House report? I took 7 it that Hewitt and the House report in particular are 8 thinking of the case where a complaint is filed charging X 9 as unlawful, and before there is an adjudication the 10 defendant ceases the unlawful practice, and it says in 11 that instance the Court should still award fees, even 12 though it concludes that no formal relief is necessary. 13 Now, as I read that report, I thought it 14 certainly favors your opponents, and then the question 15 would be whether this Court should credit it. Now, I'm 16 asking you that because I want to -- you know, I want you 17 to point out why I'm wrong, if I'm wrong. 18 MR. CLEEK: Your Honor, I think that you're 19 wrong for this reason. The whole background for 1988, and 20 of course we're interpreting the two statutes here for 21 prevailing party considerations based on 1988, the whole 22 background for 1988 is Alyeska. The United States 23 district courts don't have equity power to give attorneys' 24 fees, so Congress must explicitly set out what the 25 parameters of that power is and describe, pick who gets

1 it. Congress decided in this case prevailing parties got 2 it. 3 Now, the House report does refer to informal 4 relief, but the informal relief, Your Honor, could be a 5 settlement. The informal relief could be a consent 6 decree. 7 QUESTION: Mr. Cleek, I'm not -8 QUESTION: Well, in looking -- right in this, 9 where it says voluntarily ceasing, I didn't think it was 10 formal, but then I thought many of these statutes were 11 passed at a time where civil rights violations all over 12 the country were common, and many of the statutes were 13 passed to end widespread violations of civil rights. 14 Now, with that in the back of my mind, would I 15 think that Congress would want plaintiffs to get their 16 attorneys' fees where they led to the cessation of civil 17 rights violations? I would think yes. But that's a 18 general comment, and I want you to respond to that, to 19 correct me if I'm wrong about that. 20 MR. CLEEK: All right, sir. Let me respond in 21 this manner. The Hewitt case does suggest, particularly 22 in declaratory judgment case, that a voluntary change that 23 affords the relief might make the person prevailing in 24 that circumstance. I believe that Hewitt has to be read 25 with the other cases that this Court has considered, from

1 Hanrahan to Hewitt, and including Hewitt, that say you 2 must get success on the merits. 3 Now, that voluntary change, success on the 4 merits, and then we have Texas Teachers v. Garland two 5 years later that says there must be a material alteration 6 of the legal relationship of the parties, and then Farrar, 7 that says it must be formalized in some fashion, all those 8 must be read together. 9 If you read Hewitt by itself, it does support an 10 argument for the other side. I can't deny that. But 11 Hewitt must be read with all of these other 12 considerations, and when you read it with all those other 13 considerations, it does not support the catalyst -14 QUESTION: Mr. Cleek, I'm not a big fan of 15 attributing a House report to the entire Congress. I 16 would much rather look to the language of the statute, but 17 isn't it -- if you look to the reports, isn't it possible 18 that when whoever wrote it was speaking about voluntary 19 cessation of the unlawful conduct, he was talking about 20 voluntary cessation of conduct acknowledged to be 21 unlawful, that there's a difference between ceasing it 22 because oh, yeah, you got us, and we'll -- you know, I 23 agree that this was wrong, and ceasing it because, my God, 24 this lawsuit is going to cost us another $2 million, it is 25 simply not worth it?

1 By the way, I'm not sure whether that makes the 2 lawsuit a catalyst or not. It probably does. You know, 3 there's something to the claim, but it's just not worth 4 fighting it for another 3 years and $2 million in fees. 5 Let's throw in the towel, forget about it, even though I 6 think what we're doing is lawful. I suppose that would be 7 a catalyst. 8 But can't you read the House reports as meaning 9 voluntary cessation of conduct acknowledged to be 10 unlawful? 11 MR. CLEEK: Your Honor, I think that you can do 12 that, and as a matter of fact it makes eminent good sense, 13 because otherwise the use of unlawful would have been 14 unnecessary. 15 QUESTION: But the dividing line that you put 16 with a settlement -- now, a settlement, many of these 17 settlements, am I not right, say, I don't admit that I did 18 one thing wrong, but I'm settling this lawsuit, and the 19 Congress would make a distinction between that kind of 20 settlement just because it's on a piece of paper filed in 21 court, where the defendant said, I am paying the plaintiff 22 out of the goodness of my heart, but we were never any 23 wrongdoers. We never violated any law. That counts for 24 the catalyst, because it's a settlement, and then to say 25 if the same exact thing happens, it doesn't count, that
43 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 seems irrational to me. 2 MR. CLEEK: Your Honor, that argument has been 3 made by the petitioners and their amici in this case, and 4 what I think you're suggesting is, if you have a 5 settlement that Congress has recognized and this Court has 6 recognized grants prevailing party status, then if you 7 have a voluntary act that affords the same sort of relief, 8 how is that any different. 9 The difference is this. A settlement, of 10 course, clearly, obviously, is tied to a litigation. We 11 don't need to have district courts deciding whether 52 12 legislators met by their action -13 QUESTION: Well, that means that the causation 14 problem is not a problem. The causation problem is not a 15 problem, but it doesn't strike it out if there is -- this 16 case is difficult because of the legislative action, but 17 there are other cases where it's just as clear that the 18 plaintiff propelled this action on the part of defendant. 19 MR. CLEEK: Your Honor, the only way I can 20 respond to that sensibly is that Congress had the right to 21 choose. They chose settlement. 22 QUESTION: Why couldn't you respond to it by 23 saying that where you have a written settlement you don't 24 have to acknowledge liability because the written 25 settlement is what ties it to the litigation? Where you
44 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 don't have that tie to litigation, the only thing that 2 could possibly tie it to the litigation is the 3 acknowledgement that the litigation was correct. 4 The acknowledgement, since you don't have a 5 written settlement, that, indeed, our action was unlawful 6 and therefore we're going to stop it, at least that ties 7 it to the litigation somehow. 8 MR. CLEEK: That would be correct. 9 QUESTION: Whereas just stopping it, without any 10 acknowledgement that what you were doing was wrong, you 11 have no idea whether the litigation was what produced it, 12 or whether the West Virginia legislature just decided this 13 was a stupid law, which is frankly what I think it 14 thought. 15 MR. CLEEK: Your Honor, and let me follow up 16 that with this comment. If Congress, when it enacted 17 1988, understood the difficulties that the courts faced in 18 controlling their dockets, and congested dockets, if they 19 understood the difficulties that this catalyst theory 20 might present in this kind of case, where you may be 21 having the legislators' motives inquired into, and 22 depositions of those officials, if Congress understood 23 that, and if Congress appreciated those problems as well 24 as what we have in circuit courts -- we have all sorts of 25 different requirements for proving catalyst theory, from
45 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 provocative in the First Circuit -2 QUESTION: May I interrupt you, Mr. Cleek? 3 Let's assume there's a special problem when you have to 4 prove it through a legislature, but as I understand your 5 position, you would take precisely the same position if 6 the fire marshal had had the authority on his own to 7 change the regulation and just not say anything about it. 8 You'd still say there's no entitlement to fees. 9 MR. CLEEK: Yes, I would. 10 QUESTION: Isn't that right? 11 MR. CLEEK: Yes, I would, and the reason, Your 12 Honor, is, that I believe -13 QUESTION: So that it is not important for us to 14 decide whether the legislature has to be involved, because 15 your theory doesn't really depend on legislative action. 16 It just happens to be what is true of this case. 17 MR. CLEEK: I think, Your Honor, that the only 18 reason this Court should address the legislative 19 difficulties and the concerns about intrusions into the 20 motivations of legislators is that that is such an 21 important issue that if the Court accepts the catalyst 22 theory that if there's an exception to be made for that 23 area, then it ought to be made, but with regard to your 24 first question about whether or not, if the fire marshal 25 had simply changed the rule and been motivated by the
46 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 lawsuit there would have been recovery, the answer is 2 still no, because the catalyst theory is not recognized, 3 in our view, under the prevailing party designation in 4 1988 or any of the other fee-shifting statutes. It does 5 not include -6 QUESTION: No, I understand your position. I'm 7 just suggesting your position really doesn't require a 8 legislature to be involved in order to have a valid 9 objection to the fees, but I don't really get, except you 10 say we ought to read a lot of other cases, what is your 11 response to the rather clear language in the Helms case 12 that a monetary settlement or a change in conduct that 13 redresses the plaintiff's grievances, when that occurs, 14 the plaintiff is deemed to have prevailed despite the 15 absence of a formal judgment in his favor. 16 I mean, it seems to me that reads on this case. 17 There's a fact question, of course, but it certainly 18 doesn't say there's got to be a settlement. It says, 19 despite the absence of a formal judgment, and it doesn't 20 require a settlement or a change in conduct that redresses 21 the plaintiff's grievances. You just say we should 22 abandon that language. 23 MR. CLEEK: No, Your Honor, I'm not suggesting 24 that at all, and I think that I addressed that issue 25 earlier with --
47 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 QUESTION: You say read a lot of other cases and 2 read it in context, is what your answer is. 3 MR. CLEEK: That is the only means that I can 4 address that language and explain it. That language 5 suggests that you would prevail if there was a voluntary 6 change by the defendant in the course of the litigation. 7 The only way that I can respond to that is to suggest what 8 I suggested to Justice Breyer's question, is that all 9 these cases must be read in context. If you isolate that 10 language out, then you have difficulty. 11 QUESTION: Wasn't that language dicta? 12 MR. CLEEK: It was, Your Honor. It was not 13 necessary for the resolution of that case. 14 And let me say this about Hewitt, and Your 15 Honor, of course, this is perhaps suggesting hypotheticals 16 one ought to be entertaining from the Court, but if we 17 took Hewitt out, let's assume that Hewitt never happened, 18 and you read Hanrahan and Hensley and Rhodes and Texas 19 Teachers and Farrar, there is no support in any of those 20 cases for the catalyst theory. The only support -21 QUESTION: Well, it wasn't at issue. It wasn't 22 at issue in Farrar. There was a judgment. There was a 23 judgment, but it was just for $1, so anything that Farrar 24 said would have been the clearest dictum, because there 25 was a prevailing party, not by much, and there were no
48 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 fees, because the Court said, I'm not going to give you 2 attorneys' fees for a $1 judgment. 3 MR. CLEEK: That's correct, Your Honor. 4 QUESTION: But there was no doubt that there was 5 a prevailing party in that case. 6 MR. CLEEK: In fact, this Court found that they 7 were a prevailing party because even the $1 caused a 8 change in the legal relationship between the parties, 9 because the defendant had to pay something to the 10 plaintiff he otherwise wouldn't have had to pay, but 11 Farrar still -- and you know, if we have dicta in Hewitt, 12 and dicta in Farrar, both sides are arguing that they have 13 some value, but if we look at Farrar just for the purpose 14 of establishing what this Court said is a definition of 15 the parameters of prevailing party, if we look at it just 16 for that purpose alone, then I think that the argument 17 that we made that it's not consistent with the catalyst 18 theory is very easily made and very easily understood. 19 Now, if the Court was willing to say -20 QUESTION: Well, I thought you accepted that 21 this Court had said in Friends of the Earth that the 22 catalyst theory remained an open question and that Farrar 23 did not deal with it. That's what the Court said in 24 Friends of the Earth, and I didn't think -25 MR. CLEEK: Yes.
49 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 QUESTION: -- you were quarreling with that. 2 MR. CLEEK: I'm not quarreling with that. The 3 language is clear in Friends of the Earth that Farrar was 4 not a catalyst case, and I'm not arguing that Farrar was a 5 catalyst case. What I'm arguing is that Farrar set out 6 parameters for prevailing party which has to be utilized 7 by this Court and analyzed in any sort of attorneys' fees 8 matter before the Court. 9 So we have -10 QUESTION: -- simply whether or not someone who 11 received the nominal damages a prevailing party? 12 MR. CLEEK: That's correct, Your Honor. 13 QUESTION: Okay. 14 MR. CLEEK: And the Court found that they were a 15 prevailing party -16 QUESTION: And the holding below was that they 17 were not a prevailing party? 18 MR. CLEEK: That's correct and, of course, the 19 Court continued to say that under those circumstances, 20 even to be given that designation was insufficient to 21 award fees, because there were just some cases where there 22 was no entitlement. 23 QUESTION: Refresh my memory. In Farrar, did 24 they affirm or reverse the judgment? 25 MR. CLEEK: You reversed the lower court, I

1 believe, Your Honor. 2 QUESTION: We held there was a prevailing party, 3 but didn't we say there were no fees that were due? 4 MR. CLEEK: That's correct, and I think what the 5 lower court had said, that there wasn't prevailing party 6 status, that's my recollection, and there was some 7 difference there. We had -- essentially the lower court 8 had found that there were no fees, no entitlement to fees 9 and, of course, Farrar found that there were no 10 entitlement to fees as well. 11 If there are no further questions -12 QUESTION: The lower court found no entitlement, 13 why? I don't recall that. Why did the lower court find 14 no entitlement? 15 MR. CLEEK: It seems to me, Your Honor, in 16 Farrar that -17 QUESTION: Because not a prevailing party. 18 MR. CLEEK: Right, that it was just such a -19 QUESTION: And we found no entitlement because 20 why? We found it was a prevailing party, but no 21 entitlement because of -22 QUESTION: Didn't prevail enough. 23 (Laughter.) 24 QUESTION: No, we found that they were a 25 prevailing party but there was nominal damages, so the
51 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 attorneys' fees were reduced. There were -- the court 2 awarded $1 -3 MR. CLEEK: It was a de minimis -4 QUESTION: -- and we said it was not because 5 they were not a prevailing party, but rather that it was 6 nominal damages. 7 MR. CLEEK: That's correct. 8 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Cleek. 9 MR. CLEEK: Thank you, Your Honor. 10 Mr. Arceneaux, you have 2 minutes remaining. 11 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WEBSTER J. ARCENEAUX, III 12 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 13 MR. ARCENEAUX: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 14 Mr. Cleek was assuming a hypothetical. I want 15 to assume a hypothetical for the Court as well. 16 Let us assume this Court does not accept the 17 catalyst theory. This Court is concerned with the issue 18 of administration of justice, and I am concerned that if 19 this Court does not accept the catalyst theory, then the 20 game's been shifted we talked about that Justice Scalia 21 pointed out, where a defendant that might be incredibly 22 guilty on the eve of trial, after the plaintiff has 23 incurred a lot of expenses, can moot the case out. 24 On the other hand, there may be motivation on 25 the plaintiff's part to start engaging in gamesmanship.
52 ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC. 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W. SUITE 400 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005 (202)289-2260 (800) FOR DEPO

1 We recognize that once we had the consent or the agreed 2 order, we did not have damages. The home wasn't shut 3 down, the people weren't thrown out, we had no damages, so 4 we stipulated to take damages out of it. 5 Had we known that this rule might have jumped up 6 at us, we might have thought otherwise about the damages 7 issue, so there can be gamesmanship on both sides if we 8 don't have the catalyst theory. 9 We think -- and one of the points that seems to 10 get lost, we often talk about this as if the catalyst 11 theory doesn't exist, but the fact of the matter is, the 12 catalyst theory has existed. It has been applied for 30 13 years, and the courts have not had trouble. When you look 14 at the cases, the courts are able to apply the causation 15 test. They are able to deal with these issues. 16 The district courts are equipped to make these 17 decisions, and they have made these decisions for 30 18 years, and we think that the Fourth Circuit is wrong, and 19 this Court should find, inasmuch as it did in the Laidlaw 20 case, that Farrar had no catalytic effect, that the Fourth 21 Circuit has misread Farrar, and that we should have our 22 opportunity, our day in court to present the motion for 23 attorneys' fees. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. 25 Arceneaux. The case is submitted.
