  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In May 1998, respondent was convicted of a misdemeanor drug offense in a California court and was placed on 3 years' probation. One term of his probation required respondent to submit to searches of his person or property, quote, with or without a search warrant, warrant of arrest or reasonable cause by any probation officer or law enforcement officer. The acknowledgement signed by respondent stated: I have received a copy, read, and understand the above terms and conditions of probation and agree to abide by same. The Supreme Court of California has long held that such an acknowledgement is a voluntary and enforceable consent to future searches because, under California law, a defendant may not be compelled to accept probation, but may insist instead on serving the term of confinement that is authorized by law. Less than a week after respondent was placed on probation, State police came to suspect that he was involved in an act of vandalism against electric and telecommunications facilities that caused approximately $1.5 million in damage. Relying on the search condition, police searched respondent's residence and found evidence implicating him in the crime. Respondent was subsequently indicted in Federal court on charges of conspiracy to commit arson and being a felon in possession of ammunition."

  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",

But I think if -- if such an unlikely scenario unfolded --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but isn't -- doesn't your argument have an even narrower consequence? Because part of your argument, which I -- I want to go into, rests upon the fact that if he didn't consent, the State could -- could commit him, could put him -- put him in the house of correction. And you're saying, well, a person, in effect, can consent to bargain his way out of that more -- more serious imposition, but that suggests that the only thing that he's freely consenting to is the avoidance of something that the State could do to him. The Federal Government couldn't do it to him. Nevada couldn't to him, and Afghanistan couldn't do it to him. So, doesn't -- doesn't that suggest that the only thing that he's consenting to is what he has to consent to, and that is to let California people search him so he doesn't have to go behind bars now?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "Well, the Supreme Court of California has construed the consent to -- not to apply to searches that are conducted for purposes of harassment or in an unreasonable manner."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but what about my -- what about my question? If -- if there is significance in the -- in your argument, and I take it there is. If there is significance in the fact that California can put him behind bars if he doesn't agree, doesn't it follow that his consent is likewise limited, i.e., limited to agreeing to let officers of the State that could put him behind bars search him?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "I don't -- I don't think that No. follows. That is, the reason that California insists in many cases upon a waiver of Fourth Amendment rights as a condition of release on probation is that it wants to ensure that there will be no unnecessary barriers to monitoring the individual's compliance with the terms of his probation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That is to say monitoring by California."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "Well, it wouldn't -- it would extend beyond monitoring by California, because one of the terms of probation is that the individual avoid violations of any criminal law. That is, the individual would be in violation of his probation if he violated --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, sure, I -- I understand that, but it's California that monitors California probationers, isn't it? It's not -- it's not Federal probation officers and it's not Nevada probation officers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "Certainly California has the primary interest in ensuring that California probationers comply with the terms of their probation, but -- but it would be a violation of the California probation for respondent or another probationer to violate Federal law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Oh, I -- I realize that, but I'm just saying -- well, let me -- let me put the question to you blankly. What is the significance for your argument in the fact that California could commit him? Is -- is -- are you implicitly making the argument that because California could commit him, California could do something lesser than committing him; i.e., it could let him out subject to a limitation on Fourth Amendment rights? Is -- is that your argument?"

    "speech": "What then is the significance of the power of California to commit him?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "I think the significance is that this is -- that the defining characteristic of probationers is that they have recently been convicted of criminal offenses, and the premise of the institution of probation, as the Court said in Griffin, is that a probationer is more likely than the average citizen to violate the law. And one possible way of dealing, obviously, with people who've recently been convicted of crimes is to incarcerate them to minimize the -- the likelihood that they will commit future criminal offenses."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Doesn't it boil down then All right. to saying that the significance of the conviction is simply that it presents the occasion for this agreement and that it's the agreement that is really what is significant here?"

    "speech": "Well, if there were no conviction, there would be no occasion for the agreement. They wouldn't be there. They wouldn't be standing in court. But once there is a conviction and the occasion has presented itself, I don't see what in your argument goes beyond the significance of the agreement itself."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "We would say that even if there had been no agreement -- that is, even if it were the case under California law, as it is under Federal law, that an individual who has no legal right to -- that an individual has no legal right to refuse probation, even if probation were a sentence that were imposed upon the defendant without his consent -- we -- we would still argue that the search condition is a reasonable term of probation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But in that case, you would be Okay. saying that because California had power to deal with him at that point, it had power, in effect, to limit his Fourth Amendment rights."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "I think that's right, and let me give an example of why we're not going quite all the way and why we think you're correct. For instance, this Court held in Bell v. Wolfish, which is not cited in our brief, but it's in 441 U.S., that prison officials may preclude inmates from receiving hard cover books from persons other than booksellers or bookstores. And the rationale for that restriction was that hard cover books could be used to smuggle contraband into the institution. We think it's very unlikely that the State could impose a similar restriction on probationers because once an individual is allowed to circulate in the community, the likelihood that his receipt of hard cover books will add a meaningful increment of danger that he will possess contraband would be pretty insignificant."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "I think it's correct that the State has an interest. I wouldn't quite put it as the State has an interest in supervising probation. The State has an interest in seeing to it that adequate measures are taken to ensure that a probationer doesn't violate the terms of his conditional release. And if -- if one of the dangers that the State fears, when a probationer is released into the community, is that he may commit Federal crimes as -- in addition to State crimes, it may reasonably choose to subject him, in effect, to increased monitoring by Federal officials by saying that he will have no right to demand the judicial warrant even as to searches by -- by those officials. So, we think that the -- a term of release like that is reasonably related to the purposes and conditions --"

That is, if the judge had wanted to sentence him to prison, he couldn't have said, no, I'll take the 3-year probationary term instead. But he could insist on imprisonment and could refuse to be placed on probation.

    "speech": "I mean, I think -- yes, I think we would say that for the -- for the consent to be valid, the individual's waiver of rights needs to bear some reasonable relationship to the fact that he's on probation.

So, because a probationer's criticism of the Government would impair no legitimate Government interests, would cause no damage distinct from any other individual's criticism of the Government, the strong inference would be that a State that imposed that condition was simply trying to stifle dissent and was attempting to use the probation condition as a hook."

Once you've -- once you've made that -- that line that it has to be related to the Government's not just penological interest, because it's certainly a punishment not to be able to criticize the Government -- I guess one of the punishments of being in prison, for example, is -- is the inability to have sexual relationships with -- with your spouse.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEWART",
    "speech": "I mean, I think if it were for a third offense, I think yes. I think the State could legitimately make the judgment that a person who has three times been convicted of drug offenses was, for the rest of his life, meaningfully more likely to violate the criminal law than the average citizen. If you talked about another type of extreme example -- for instance, upon conviction for a traffic violation, you'll be placed on lifetime probation under which you can be searched at any time -- I think it would be probably be irrational for the State to say simply because you were convicted of a traffic violation, we will regard you 20 years down the road as being more likely than the average citizen to violate the law. But the -- the point I was making about the -- the potential terms of probation becoming more onerous, if we got to a situation where because the conditions of probation were especially harsh, large numbers of probationers decided that incarceration is better than this, then the -- an individual defendant's right to choose between the two alternatives would have obvious significance. It would provide an obvious degree of -- of comfort that the -- that what was being placed upon him, if he chose probation, was not unconstitutionally onerous."

But second, even if the Government could establish consent, California's blanket search condition, which purports to permit searches at any time of the day or night, by any law enforcement officer, for any reason or no reason, is unenforceable. With regard to the first issue, the basis for the consent argument here is a one-page probation order. Mr. Knights' signature appears on the order beneath a two- line advisement of rights. The -- the first line advises him that, should he satisfactorily complete probation, he may ask to have his conviction set aside, and the second sentence confirms that he has received, read, and understood the terms and conditions of probation and agrees to abide by same. Beneath that is a line for defendant's signature, acknowledgement of receipt. As Justice Ginsburg suggested earlier, this is a notice provision. This is not an effective consent. Moreover --"

We incapacitate him in prison and we do it, in part, by searching him randomly. What What about a halfway house? about home confinement? What about probation where he is at home?

What we do in respect to that in prison is we search you randomly. When you are in the halfway house, you will be searched randomly. When you are confined to your house, you will be searched randomly. When you are on probation, you will be searched randomly. Now, my question is, why in each of those instances can the State not do the same thing?"

    "speech": "Your Honor, my answer would be that any sentence imposed must be imposed within constitutional limitations, and in this case, I think Griffin is an essential case because Griffin helps us see what are the constitutional limitations on probationers' Fourth Amendment rights. Obviously, the Fourth Amendment would dictate that police searches have -- be based upon a warrant, issued upon probable cause, and Griffin, like TLO against New Jersey, and the other special needs cases issued since, recognized that there is a limited class of cases in which special needs, beyond the normal needs of general law enforcement, make the warrant and probable cause requirements impractical. And what I would say is that for a general law enforcement search, the Fourth Amendment tells us that a warrant and probable cause are not impractical by definition. So, what we have in the probation context is a special need of probation supervision, a dual need that -- that includes both the monitoring and protection of the community, which is the Government's main focus, but in addition, rehabilitation. And I submit to you that if it were only that single focus of protecting the community, it would not be a special need beyond the general needs of law enforcement."

But this is not a case that involves the -- the exercise of that kind of power because in this case, you weren't having random searches for probation supervision based on -- on reasonable suspicion.

So, for -- for it to be a proper probationary search under Griffin, we believe it would have to satisfy other requirements.

Griffin, when it talked about the importance of deterrence and -- and searches to ensure that the probationer is compliant, the Court undertook a balancing of the degree of intrusion and the importance of the need.

The balancing turned out to be constitutional because it was not a police officer conducting a police search."

It -- it said the Wisconsin Supreme Court had -- had adopted a -- a different principle, and we said -- we begin the opinion, we think the Wisconsin Supreme Court correctly concluded that this warrantless search could not violate the Fourth Amendment. To reach that result, however, we find it unnecessary to embrace a new principle of law, as the Wisconsin court evidently did, that any search of a probationer's home by a -- satisfy the Fourth Amendment. We just didn't -- didn't consider whether we needed that new principle of law and maybe that new principle of law is at issue in this case."

And so, That's one of them. why is it unreasonable for the State to say we want to encourage this kind of thing, but part of it has to be checkups on people to make certain that they're not committing crimes? And the condition that you have checked here in the -- in the form is simply one of those conditions that would help encourage, and indeed make more sensible, this kind of range of intermediate punishments."

    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, as we point out in our brief, the -- the intermediate sanction programs, which have been implemented, I hope effectively, across this country by different States that are cited by amicus -- several of the amici -- not a single program relies on random searches by police. It is simply not a component of an effective intensive supervision program, let alone a regular probation system, in any State."

    "speaker": "FOX",
    "speech": "Your Honor, apart from California, I'm aware only of Virginia as having approved a blanket search condition such as this with no limitations for individualized suspicion and no limitation to the probation officer. Many States permit probation officers, as part of their duties, to conduct home searches."

If you admit that one of the purposes of probation is to monitor the person to make sure that they are now off their bottle, they're no longer committing crimes, if that's a purpose of probation, then why isn't this an entirely reasonable condition to say we have to check up on you to see that you're not engaging in crime anymore?"

Do you think it would be unconstitutional for a State legislature to decide that we don't want to put drug offenders in prison anymore, but we do want to impose on them, in haec verba, condition 9 of the probation order here and that -- and pass a statute and say all drug offenders who are convicted of possession of illegal drugs shall have to submit to that provision?"

There's no reasonable suspicion requirement, but in various cases, this Court has repeatedly held that detection of drug abuse may be a situation in which we dispense with individualized suspicion because it's difficult to detect always signs of inebriation. This condition does appear to require an individual to submit to police searches. So --"

So, the Fourth Amendment analysis that this Court --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "FOX",
    "speech": "Well, this I think is the important distinction between probation and police, and it's a two- part answer. First, under Scott, this Court has recognized that police have different objectives than probation officers. And so to the extent that we're talking about a -- to an extent, we are talking about a special needs programmatic exception. Certainly when the search is conducted by a probation officer, under Scott, the Court will presume that the probation officer has a probationary objective; whereas, again under Scott, a police search does not have as its goal ascertaining compliance with probation or parole conditions. And the Court has recognized that in determining that the exclusionary rule wouldn't apply to parole revocation proceedings. But second, in Edmonds, the Court indicated that the fact that a general law enforcement search, as a secondary matter, furthers special needs -- in that case highway safety -- does not bring the search scheme within the special needs exception because a secondary, incidental furtherance of a special need doesn't change the fundamental character at the programmatic level of the search. That's why police searches that are conducted pursuant to this condition are so problematic because, of course, as a secondary matter, they ensure compliance with probation conditions, but the primary objective of a police search, as -- as it was the objective this search in this case, is to investigate crime. And under the Fourth Amendment, we've already decided as a society that the hurdles of requiring a warrant and requiring probable cause are acceptable costs to impose on the police when they're engaged in general law enforcement. That's why this condition is unconstitutional. The Government's consent argument that we started with doesn't save it for the reasons that I suggested earlier."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You said something in your brief about the unconstitutional conditions doctrine rarely applies in Fourth Amendment cases. Now, you did say that, didn't you?"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And why do you think that's so?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FOX",
    "speech": "I think the special needs balancing is the unconstitutional doctrines -- unconstitutional conditions doctrine in the Fourth Amendment situation. It's -- it's virtually an identical balancing, and I think this Court, in assessing Fourth Amendment issues, again and again has returned to the special needs balancing, which is particular to the privacy interests and the State needs that the Court faces when resolving a Fourth Amendment case. So, when you look at unconstitutional conditions, I think it's achieving the same end by requiring a central nexus and then, most importantly, looking at proportionality. I think that's what -- I'm sorry, Your Honor."

And in light of that fact, California has, by conditioning probation on consent to search by any probation officer or law enforcement officer -- the State has, in effect, attempted to enlist its police officers in the administration of the probation program. The core message that this -- excuse me -- that this consent term sends to police officers within the State is, if you suspect that a known probationer is in violation of the most fundamental term of his release -- namely, he's committing future crimes -- you may conduct a search that is designed to confirm or dispel that suspicion --"

A probation officer might decide to conduct spot checks of his charges even if there were no reason to believe that a particular individual was violating the law. A police officer would be less likely to regard that as an effective use of his resources and -- and the department's resources. But -- but the point here is that when a State police officer conducts a search intended to confirm or dispel the suspicion that a probationer is engaged in new criminal activity, he is contributing directly and precisely to the realization of a core probation purpose. I have nothing further."
