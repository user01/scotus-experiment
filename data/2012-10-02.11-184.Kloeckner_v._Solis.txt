1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:02 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 11-184, Kloeckner v. Solis. 5 Mr. Schnapper. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 9 it please the Court: 10 The first sentence of Section 7703(b)(2) 11 provides that district courts have jurisdiction over all 12 mixed cases, and that provision is largely dispositive 13 here. 14 The second sentence of 7703(b)(2) on which 15 the Government relies is a statute of limitations, and 16 it doesn't limit the jurisdiction of Federal courts. 17 That subsection is set out at pages 16a to 18 17a of the Government's brief. The first sentence 19 provides that for a described category of cases, they 20 are to be, quote, "filed under one of the listed Federal 21 antidiscrimination statutes." 22 As this Court pointed out in Elgin, all of 23 those are statutes which authorize jurisdiction 24 and claims in district courts. Indeed, in Title VII and 25 the ADEA, that is the only Federal court which is
3

1 authorized to hear the cases. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper, could you 3 clarify what the district court, as you see it, does? 4 Does it deal only with the discrimination claim, or does 5 it deal with the MSPB's procedural ruling? 6 MR. SCHNAPPER: With regard to the -- when 7 the case gets to district court, there may be two 8 substantive claims, a discrimination claim and a CSRA 9 claim. Your question, I take it, is about the former. 10 Our view is that the claim is filed and 11 pled, as indeed it was pled in this case, as a 12 discrimination case; in this case, under several 13 different statutes. And the complaint here reads very 14 much like an ordinary discrimination complaint. 15 The Government may raise the -- that sort of 16 procedural issue as an affirmative defense, and it would 17 be free to do so here. And that -- that happens on a 18 number of occasions. 19 For example, if there were a case in which 20 the Plaintiff had not, as required by the regulations, 21 appealed to the MSPB within 30 days of the -- of receipt 22 of the agency decision, the Government could move to 23 dismiss that claim on what the lower courts call 24 exhaustion grounds. And the lower courts have 25 repeatedly sustained those motions -

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Schnapper -2 MR. SCHNAPPER: -- but that's a 3 determinative defense. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the critical 5 point, I gather, is what standard of review the district 6 court will apply to that exhaustion question, or the 7 bar question, right? 8 I assume you think that the standard review 9 in the district court is going to be more favorable to 10 your client than the standard -- the arbitrary and 11 capricious standard that would be applicable in the 12 Federal circuit? 13 I guess -14 MR. SCHNAPPER: When it's come up, 15 Your Honor, it has generally been a question of law, 16 like whether the 30-day rule had applied. If you had 17 something that was -- if it were a factual issue, our 18 contention is then those Section 7703(c) factual issues 19 have to be decided de novo. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why don't we take this -21 this very case, where the MSPB said that -- that the 22 claim was time barred, so the Government would raise it 23 as an affirmative defense. 24 MR. SCHNAPPER: And the first question would 25 be whether it's an affirmative defense at all, and our
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 position would be that it is not. Not everything that 2 could go awry in the internal procedure is an 3 affirmative defense. 4 One of the central principles of the 5 1972 amendments to Title VII was to create an exhaustion 6 regime which is precise, simple and short. And if -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor, can I back 8 you up a minute to join the two questions that my 9 colleague posed to you? 10 Let's assume there's a merits-based decision 11 on the CSRA and one on the discrimination. In the 12 normal course, assuming you are not barred by being 13 untimely, you could go to the district court, and the 14 district court presumably would have jurisdiction, if 15 one is a discrimination-based decision, to decide both 16 questions. 17 What's the standard of review that a court 18 would apply to each of those claims independently or 19 together? I mean -20 MR. SCHNAPPER: They're there -21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that that's -22 MR. SCHNAPPER: -- it's -- yeah, I totally 23 understand the question. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We can then fight about 25 whether the factual issue regarding the timeliness and
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 exhaustion should be subject to one or the other 2 standard of review, but what are the standards of 3 review? 4 MR. SCHNAPPER: They -- they are 5 different. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. 7 MR. SCHNAPPER: The -- the discrimination 8 claim is dealt with de novo. The intent of Congress 9 was that it would generally be treated like a private 10 discrimination claim. 11 However, the CSRA claim is dealt with under 12 the same standard that would apply in the Federal 13 circuit. And that's -14 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could you tell me 15 what -16 MR. SCHNAPPER: -- well established. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to 18 interrupt you. 19 MR. SCHNAPPER: That's what the lower courts 20 have been doing. And we don't -- we think that's 21 correct. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you finish your prior 23 answer? You -- you started to say -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you started to say that 25 the Civil Service Reform Act made some fundamental
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 change? 2 MR. SCHNAPPER: No, Your Honor. I was 3 talking about the amendments to the 19 -- to Title VII 4 in 1972. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 6 MR. SCHNAPPER: Prior to that, courts were 7 applying the -- judicially fashioned exhaustion 8 requirements. And the -- Congress made a decision to 9 replace that. 10 As this Court noted in Chandler and in Brown 11 v. GSA, Congress concluded, I think correctly, and the 12 Court's opinion suggests that, that the steps necessary 13 to exhaust were not clear. 14 So the regime established by Section 717 of 15 Title VII, which was adopted in 1972, sets up an 16 exhaustion requirement which is clear, simple and 17 limited in time. It requires the plaintiff to file a 18 complaint, wait at that point 180 days, and at that 19 point, the plaintiff was done and could go to district 20 court. 21 Plaintiff also had the option at that point 22 of going to the Civil Service Commission, waiting 23 180 days. But as long as a timely complaint was filed, 24 that was all that was required of the plaintiff. And 25 that was a fundamental change in the way this had been
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 dealt with. 2 The ADEA regime, which was adopted in 1974, 3 was actually even simpler, although it's been changed a 4 little bit since. The plaintiff to exhaust had to do 5 only one of two things, either file a complaint with the 6 EEOC, period, or give the EEOC notice that the plaintiff 7 was going to sue and wait 30 days. 8 As the Government pointed out in its brief 9 in Stevens, the exhaustion regime under the ADEA hadn't 10 -- didn't in any way address what happened after the 11 complaint was filed. It simply said, file the 12 complaint. 13 That is the fundamental principle that's 14 animated the Title VII exhaustion requirement in Title 15 VII and the ADEA, and we don't think the CSRA was 16 written to change that. 17 Indeed, to the contrary, the CSRA has -- it 18 doesn't do so expressly -- it incorporates by reference 19 those statutes; it expressly reiterates the de novo 20 exhaustion requirement. It actually shortened the 21 period of time that plaintiff has to wait for these 22 cases. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- you're talking 24 about the discrimination claim. In your view, could the 25 plaintiff now in the district court say, I'll forget
9

Alderson Reporting Company

1 the CSRA remedy; district court, you have authority to 2 hear the Title VII case, the ADEA case, and that's all I 3 need? And so I'm not -- I'm abandoning my CSRA. 4 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, Your Honor. The Plaintiff 5 can do that. The -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then that would take 7 care of the whole thing you discussed before about the 8 affirmative defense and the Government. It would be the 9 plaintiff's choice, I want my Title VII case and that's 10 it. 11 MR. SCHNAPPER: No, Your Honor. The 12 affirmative defenses could still be raised. It's just 13 that the CSRA claim under Section 7703(c) would -- would 14 be abandoned. And that's -15 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what provision -16 MR. SCHNAPPER: -- that's what happened 17 here. It's not uncommon. 18 The CSRA claim involves a right that is much 19 more valuable to the plaintiff in the administrative 20 process. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: What provision authorizes 22 the filing of anything other than a discrimination claim 23 in district court? I don't see it. 24 MR. SCHNAPPER: The statute says "Cases of 25 discrimination subject to" -
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 JUSTICE ALITO: "Cases of discrimination" -2 MR. SCHNAPPER: "Cases of discrimination 3 subject to 7702." And 7702 -4 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. It says, "shall be 5 filed under Title VII." 6 So you are saying that a nondiscrimination 7 claim can be filed under Title VII? 8 MR. SCHNAPPER: No. The way the courts have 9 read this, and I think correctly, is this: If -- so 10 this is just one case. It's a little bit like 11 supplemental jurisdiction. So long as the plaintiff is 12 asserting a discrimination claim, the CSRA claim comes 13 along with it. 14 If the plaintiff were to abandon the 15 discrimination claim, then the case would have to go to 16 the Federal Circuit. That's the way the courts have 17 interpreted that. 18 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I understand that a 19 lot of courts have read it that way. I find it 20 difficult to see how it fits in the statutory language. 21 And in particular, since the second sentence of 22 subsection (2) there has its own filing deadline, it 23 seems strange to have a district court review the 24 timeliness of the filing before the MSPB. 25 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, the second point you
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 make is really separate from the first, because even if 2 only a discrimination claim is filed, the Government can 3 insert an affirmative defense, and one possible 4 affirmative defense which the Government has repeatedly 5 asserted successfully is that the appeal to the MSPB was 6 untimely. So that happens either way. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if you give up 8 your CSRA claim, they can assert that defense? 9 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Yes. It's because -10 because the discrimination statutes themselves have two 11 requirements. You have to have filed the complaint or 12 an appeal, depending on where you are in the process. 13 You have to wait a certain amount of time if you don't 14 have a decision. 15 The statutes themselves don't -16 JUSTICE ALITO: I don't understand why 17 you're giving this up, and I don't see -- I also don't 18 see any provision that says that -- that specifies what 19 the standard of review in the district court is for a 20 nondiscrimination claim. 21 (C) sets out the standard of review in the 22 Federal Circuit for a nondiscrimination claim, but it 23 pointedly says nothing about the district court. 24 Doesn't that suggest that that claim doesn't go to the 25 district court?

1 MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, that question, 2 of course, isn't here because we haven't asserted a CSRA 3 claim. And if you have doubts about it, I think I would 4 reserve that for another case. But, we think the -- the 5 courts have treated this as -- the statute doesn't say 6 claims of discrimination subject to 7702. It says 7 "cases of discrimination." 8 And if you look at section 7702, which is 9 set out at page 8(a) of the Government's brief, it 10 describes the cases involved as cases which contain 11 these two elements. They are treated as one case in the 12 administrative process. And it would be highly peculiar 13 for the Government -- for the statute to take one 14 administrative proceeding and then split it in half. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose -- suppose the 16 Civil Service Reform Act had said nothing at all about 17 -- about suits under the Civil Rights Act, under the Age 18 Discrimination and Employment Act and so forth. What 19 would the situation be? Wouldn't you have a right to go 20 to district court? 21 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Title VII and all the 22 statutes authorize that. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, to prevent you from 24 going to district court under those statutes, you have 25 to find a repealer contained somewhere -
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. SCHNAPPER: In that -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- in the Civil Service 3 Reform Act, correct? 4 MR. SCHNAPPER: That's exactly right. And 5 we think this is a classic example of -- for application 6 of the rule that implied repeals are disfavored. This 7 -- this statute is quite precise when -- when it's 8 changing something, it's very specific. The second 9 section, section 7703(b)(2), begins with the words 10 "notwithstanding," because it is changing the statute of 11 limitations that would otherwise apply. It's changing 12 it from 90 days in Title VII to 30 days. 13 So when Congress wanted to change something, 14 it was very specific. But the whole thrust of this 15 statute is to leave in place, except where very 16 specifically it does otherwise, the regime that existed 17 under Title VII in the ADEA. 18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I make sure I 19 understand something that you said, Mr. Schnapper. When 20 you talk about the affirmative defenses that the 21 Government can raise, that is -- those are exhaustion 22 defenses under the applicable anti-discrimination 23 statute, right? It's whatever exhaustion requirements 24 Title VII sets out or whatever exhaustion requirements 25 the ADEA sets out; is that correct?
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. SCHNAPPER: Not -- that's not entirely 2 correct, Your Honor. There are -- there are exhaustion 3 premises in the statute, but these statutes do not 4 contain a time period within which a charge or a 5 complaint must be filed with the agency, and they don't 6 contain a time period within which an appeal must be 7 taken. Those time periods are in the regulations. 8 The lower courts have taken the position 9 that those time periods also have to be complied with, 10 and we think that's correct. 11 In the case of -12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Those time periods relevant 13 to the MSPB? 14 MR. SCHNAPPER: And there are also time 15 periods relevant to filing a -- complaint at the agency 16 level. It's an -- in the case of a private 17 discrimination claim, that time period is specified by 18 Title VII. 19 But Section 717 about Federal employees is 20 simply silent. Congress didn't deal with it. But it 21 did authorize the EEOC and the MSPB to write 22 regulations. They have both written regulations that -23 with regard to the agency, it is the EEOC regulations 24 which set up the time period within which a complaint 25 must be filed. With regard to appeals to the MSPB, both
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the EEOC and the MSPB have regulations which are the 2 same. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't that a 4 repealer of what would otherwise be the law under all 5 these civil rights statutes? Why isn't that a repealer 6 of what would otherwise be their right to go to district 7 court? 8 You are saying, no, you can't go to district 9 court because of these time limits, not even established 10 by statute, but, for Pete's sake, established by 11 regulation. You think that that's -- that's an 12 effective repealer of the right to go to district court? 13 MR. SCHNAPPER: We don't -- we think not, 14 Your Honor. 15 Again, this doesn't go to subject matter 16 jurisdiction, which is specified in the statute. The 17 statute creates a regime. It doesn't set up time 18 periods. 19 We think Congress -- the statute should be 20 read to -- to mean that the authority of the Government, 21 of the agencies to write regulations, includes 22 regulations setting up time periods. It's just 23 inconceivable that -24 JUSTICE KAGAN: And would that -25 MR. SCHNAPPER: -- Congress contemplated you
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 would have forever to do these things. 2 JUSTICE KAGAN: And would that put the 3 employee who has a mixed case in the same position as an 4 employee who has a straight anti-discrimination case? 5 MR. SCHNAPPER: Non-mixed case. Yes. Yes. 6 There are regulations governing both. 7 The non-mixed case claim would only be 8 governed by the EEOC regulation. The mixed case claim 9 is governed as well by the time limit in the MSPB 10 regulation, but that is the same as the time limit in 11 the EEOC regulation. 12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I've probably led a 13 charmed life, but I've never heard of mixed case until 14 this matter came before us. And I was -- I suppose you 15 have to adopt the phrase, but the statute 7703 just say 16 "cases," "cases of discrimination," which is what this 17 is. 18 We don't usually think of cases that we call 19 a discrimination case based on whether or not it 20 contains other issues. It's a case. 21 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, Your Honor, the -- you 22 have led a charmed life. 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I think that helps 24 you. 25 MR. SCHNAPPER: I'm not sure how that
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 affects it. The phrase mixed case is in the 2 regulations, both of the EEOC. It also was in currency 3 prior to 1978. When Congress was working on this 4 problem, it was already calling these kinds of cases 5 mixed cases. 6 And, of course, we haven't touched on this. 7 A mixed case is a case which involves -- has two 8 elements. First, it involves what's called, under the 9 Civil Service Reform Act, an appealable issue. That is 10 an issue which can be appealed to the MSPB, not -11 JUSTICE ALITO: Can't an employee take a 12 mixed case appeal to the Federal circuit? 13 MR. SCHNAPPER: You could not take that case 14 to the Federal circuit without waiving your 15 antidiscrimination claim. That is what the -- that's 16 the way we read the law and that is the way the MSPB 17 reads the law. The MSPB regulation expressly provides 18 that if you want to go to the Federal circuit you must 19 waive that right. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper, can you 21 explain something about the MSPB's role? That is, once 22 you have a final decision from the agency, you could go 23 right to court. You don't -- on the discrimination 24 claim, right? You don't need to go to the MSPB. You 25 don't have to exhaust anything before the MSPB to get
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 your discrimination claim. So, how does the M -- the 2 possibility of going to the MSPB make the discrimination 3 claim any less ripe for judicial review than it would be 4 if you stopped at the agency level? 5 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it's our view that 6 once you appeal to the MSPB, and putting aside the 7 unusual situation of people who withdraw the appeal, you 8 then must wait, under the statute, 120 days or until you 9 have a decision. So you are ready, all set, and you 10 could go to court after the district court decision, but 11 if you appeal to the MSPB, you then have to wait until 12 120 days have passed or you have a decision. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What are -- what are your 14 advantages? You are deciding -- you have the final 15 agency decision, you could go right to court on the 16 discrimination claim. What do you gain by invoking the 17 MSPB's authority? 18 MR. SCHNAPPER: What you gain are the rights 19 in Section 7701(c), which are set out on page 3(a) of 20 the Government's brief. In the appeal to the MSPB with 21 regard to the Civil -- the CSRA claim, the burden is on 22 the Government to establish by a preponderance of the 23 evidence that its decision was correct. If you bypass 24 the MSPB and go to district court, then your claim is 25 only a claim under section 7703(c), which requires the
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 plaintiff to establish that there wasn't even 2 substantial evidence to support the decision. So, 3 plaintiff -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Suppose -- I'm 5 sorry. 6 MR. SCHNAPPER: The CSRA claim is much more 7 valuable at the MSPB. In terms of discrimination claim, 8 in the real world that's probably not why people go to 9 the MSPB. The MSPB, according to the only study I've 10 been able to find, out of 2,000 mixed cases the MSPB 11 actually only found discrimination in four. But a much 12 higher percentage of CSRA claims are successful there. 13 So that's why people go there. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I suppose if you 15 say, I was fired on the basis of race, and the agency 16 says, no, you were fired because you were incompetent, 17 you could take the incompetence claim to the MSPB, and 18 if you win, saying, no, you were perfectly competent, 19 they shouldn't have fired you, you get that relief and 20 you don't need to proceed with the discrimination -21 MR. SCHNAPPER: Sure. And that's why people 22 go there. That's why people go there. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You argued that you were 24 exceeding the dismissals on the basis of jurisdiction 25 should go to the Federal circuit, but that you were only
20

1 invoking the exception that procedural dismissals should 2 be permitted to go to the district court or authorized 3 to go. Are you still standing by that distinction? 4 MR. SCHNAPPER: No, no, that was not our 5 distinction. That was the distinction that I think in 6 the Tenth Circuit in Harms-7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes, but when you argued 8 it below you argued the exception, you didn't argue the 9 jurisdictional rule. Are you abandoning that 10 distinction? 11 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Our view is that all 12 mixed cases go to the district court. That is the view 13 of the MSPB and of the EEOC and the regulations -14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's not the view of 15 the circuit courts, even the courts -16 MR. SCHNAPPER: It's not the view of the 17 circuit courts. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even the courts whose 19 exception you -20 MR. SCHNAPPER: That is not their view and 21 we think -22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Every circuit court 23 unanimously holds that jurisdictional dismissals 24 should go only to the Federal circuit. 25 MR. SCHNAPPER: Right. We think that that's
21

1 wrong and -2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you -3 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry -- go ahead. I'm 4 sorry. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Should you be arguing 6 this before us? 7 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, you don't -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is this a distinction 9 you should abandon here? 10 MR. SCHNAPPER: No, Your Honor. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or at least ask us not 12 to address? 13 MR. SCHNAPPER: You don't need to address 14 it, but we think those decisions are wrong. The 15 statutory arguments that we're making treat -- draw no 16 distinction between procedural and jurisdictional -17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Actually the 7512 18 argument has more legs, I think. The point is that 19 you're only permitted to go to district court on issues 20 of discrimination that are within the Board's 21 jurisdiction. So if -22 MR. SCHNAPPER: It's somewhat stronger, but 23 there are a couple of reasons why we think this 24 distinction doesn't make sense. The first one is if 25 jurisdictional issues went to the Federal circuit you
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 would have an -- a really bizarre problem of -- of 2 splitting the claim, and here's why: If, under the EEOC 3 regulations which the Government has referred to, if the 4 MSPB holds that it didn't have jurisdiction in a mixed 5 case, the discrimination claim doesn't die. Under the 6 regulations it goes back to the agency, which then 7 processes it as a non-mixed case. But the plaintiff is 8 still free to challenge the decision of the MSPB that it 9 had no jurisdiction. In the Government's view, that 10 would go to the Federal circuit. So the case would then 11 be pending in two different places. And if the 12 plaintiff came to the end of the line in the -- at the 13 agency level and lost, the plaintiff clearly would go to 14 district court. So the case would then be pending in 15 two different places. On our view, everything goes to 16 the district court. 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Schnapper, if I disagree 18 with everything that you just said, I can still rule for 19 you in this case, right? 20 MR. SCHNAPPER: You can, and you don't need 21 to address what I just said. 22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Because there does seem to 23 be a good deal of difference between the question, what 24 happens to something that is clearly a mixed case, and 25 alternatively, the question of whether something is a
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 mixed case; that is, whether it includes a claim about 2 an action which the employee may appeal to the MSPB. 3 And one could think that questions about what can be 4 appealed to the MSPB ought to go to the Federal circuit 5 under this statutory language in a way that questions 6 that are involved in this case do not. 7 MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, you don't need 8 to rule for that -- me on that, but if I could identify 9 another problem before my time runs out. There is -10 and it comes up in two ways. Sometimes whether a case 11 is appealable depends on whether there was 12 discrimination. There is a district court decision in 13 Barrow v. Louisiana in which that problem arose. I will 14 spare you -15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that just makes the 16 next case very complicated but it has nothing to do with 17 this case; is that correct? 18 MR. SCHNAPPER: Right. But that's why I 19 think if you have doubts about it, you should stay away 20 from it because that's very bad. In addition, in a 21 constructive discharge case based on sexual harassment, 22 whether there's jurisdiction, the MSPB in deciding 23 whether there is jurisdiction has to decide whether 24 there was sexual harassment. It seems to me you would 25 not want that going to the Federal circuit.

HARRINGTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 8 it please the Court: 9 I would like to start if I could with 10 Justice Scalia's -- I'm sorry. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you abandoning the 12 jurisdictional procedural distinction as you did in your 13 brief? Are you telling us to rule either completely for 14 you or against you? 15 MS. HARRINGTON: That's always been our 16 position, Justice Sotomayor. Our position has 17 consistently been that the only decisions of the MSPB 18 that can get review in a district court are decisions on 19 the issue of discrimination. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are prepared on 21 behalf of the Government to say that if we rule that 22 procedural dismissals can go to the district court, then 23 you -- then the Government will concede that 24 jurisdictional dismissal should as well? 25 MS. HARRINGTON: No, Your Honor.

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under 7512. 2 MS. HARRINGTON: Again, we don't think any 3 of them should and -4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We don't have to reach 5 that question in this case, but your brief seemed to 6 make the argument that there was no basis for the 7 distinction between procedural and jurisdictional. 8 MS. HARRINGTON: I agree that there is no 9 basis for the distinction and part of that is because, 10 as my friend Mr. Schnapper pointed out, there is an EEOC 11 regulation providing that when the board dismisses a 12 case on jurisdictional grounds the case can go back to 13 the agency, the agency can essentially reissue its final 14 decision, and then the plaintiff goes in to district 15 court. So if the whole point is to find a way for an 16 employee to get into district court on her 17 discrimination claim, we've already had that taken care 18 of in jurisdictional dismissal cases. So the action 19 really here is with procedural dismissals. 20 And if -- I would like to start with 21 Justice Scalia's line of questions about whether there 22 has been a repeal of the right to go to district court 23 on discrimination claims. And I think our starting 24 point is in the Federal Courts Improvement Act which is 25 28 USC 1295(a)(9), which provides that review of MSPB
26

Alderson Reporting Company

1 decisions is exclusively in the Federal circuit. This 2 court is recently -- most recently in Elgin, but in 3 various cases over of the last 25 years has seen that 4 that is an exclusive grant of judicial review of 5 jurisdiction in the Federal circuit over MSPB final 6 decisions, and as the Court pointed out in Elgin the 7 only exception to that is for the subset of final board 8 decisions that are covered in 7703(b)(2). And if you 9 look at 7703(b)(2) the only reference to a final board 10 decision is at the top of page 17(a) of the Government's 11 brief is to judicially reviewable actions under section 12 7702. Now we put a lot of emphasis on the phrase 13 judicially reviewable action and the reason we do that 14 is because throughout the entire U.S. Code that phrase 15 is only ever used either in or in reference to section 16 7702. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, does that mean 18 that it is not a judicially reviewable action if it is 19 thrown out on a procedural ground. 20 MS. HARRINGTON: It means that it's not a 21 judicially reviewable action under 7702. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? I 23 mean, we think of a -- we review cases on procedural 24 objections all the time and we think of those as 25 judicially reviewable. It's -- it's a real stretch to
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 say simply because it says "judicially reviewable" it 2 means judicially reviewable on the merits. 3 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, in our view, again, 4 because it uses the phrase "judicially reviewable 5 action" under 7702 and that phrase "judicially 6 reviewable action" in the whole U.S. Code is only ever 7 used when you are talking about 7702, that -- in our 8 view that's the signal that that's a term of art in this 9 context. 10 So although dismissal on procedural grounds 11 is a board action subject to judicial review, in our 12 view it's not a judicially reviewable action under 7702. 13 And so you need to look at 7702 to see how -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you say that 15 again? 16 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A little more 18 slowly. 19 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. A procedural 20 dismissal by the board is a final board action that's 21 subject to judicial review in the Federal Circuit. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. It's subject 23 to judicial review. 24 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, the next -

1 MS. HARRINGTON: But it does not fall within 2 the term of art "judicially reviewable action" under 3 7702. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So I thought 5 that your argument in the brief reduced to the question 6 that an action subject to judicial review in one section 7 is not judicially reviewable in another. That's right? 8 MS. HARRINGTON: Say it again? I'm sorry? 9 (Laughter.) 10 MS. HARRINGTON: This is going to happen a 11 lot. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: More slowly. 13 (Laughter.) 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought -- I 15 thought I heard you to say, and this is what I 16 understood your brief to say, that an action that is 17 subject to judicial review is not judicially reviewable 18 under 7703(b)(2). 19 MS. HARRINGTON: That's right. It does not 20 fall within -21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 22 MS. HARRINGTON: -- the exception to 23 exclusive -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a tough 25 argument.

1 MS. HARRINGTON: -- review. 2 It's a tough statute. In our view, our 3 argument is the best reading of the overall statute. 4 And again, because we think "judicially reviewable 5 action" under 7702 is sort of the linchpin phrase in 6 7703(b)(2), we want to look to 7702 to how the phrase 7 "judicially reviewable action" is used by Congress in 8 that statute, and the relevant pages here are page 8a 9 and 9a in the statutory appendix to the Government's 10 brief. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask you a couple 12 questions? 13 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When the Federal Circuit 15 was created, this language preexisted its creation, 16 correct? 17 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So could you tell me how 19 when Congress was writing 7702 it was creating the 20 system that you are advocating when it had no idea that 21 it would ever create the Federal Circuit? 22 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I have two answers. 23 The first is that in the last 25 years in all the cases 24 where this Court has looked as section 7703, in Lindahl 25 and Fausto and most recently in Elgin, the Court has
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 interpreted the statute as it exists today, which as it 2 exists today directs review of board decisions to the 3 Federal Circuit. 4 But the second answer is, even for that 5 brief window after the CSRA was enacted before the 6 Federal Circuit was created, Congress still had taken 7 away jurisdiction from district courts over board 8 decisions and had directed them to the courts of 9 appeals. And this Court recognized in Fausto that that 10 -- Congress specifically had that intent when it enacted 11 the CSRA. It was tired of this concurrent jurisdiction 12 in all the district courts throughout the country over 13 Federal employment actions and it wanted to reduce a 14 layer of review and direct them to fewer courts. Now -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That still doesn't 16 answer my question, which is: Assuming there is no 17 Federal Circuit, I have to read the language that exists 18 in 7702 and 7703, and I see judicial review, appealable 19 judicial review, used not in the manner that you're 20 describing. 21 MS. HARRINGTON: I disagree, Your Honor. I 22 mean -- and there is nothing in 7702 or 7703 that would 23 indicate that Congress wanted, even in 1978 to have MSPB 24 final decisions reviewed in district court. And again, 25 we don't need to assume that the Federal Circuit doesn't
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 exist today because it does, and that's how this Court 2 has construed the statute for the last 25 years, ever 3 since the -4 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Ms. Harrington, go back 5 to the question that the Chief Justice asked you, 6 because the question was: Should we read "judicially 7 reviewable action" as something different from action 8 subject to judicial review, which is how you would 9 normally read that language, as something different from 10 just final agency action that you can take to a court. 11 Not saying which court, that you can just take to a 12 court. 13 And you're asking us -- you said it's a term 14 of art. So I guess the next question is: How do you 15 get the definition of the term of art that you say 16 exists in this statute? 17 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, you look at 7702, and 18 let me just say, even if you disagree with us that it's 19 a term of art, it's hard to disagree with the fact that 20 it has to be a judicially reviewable action under 7702. 21 That's in the text of 7703(b)(2). 22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, it has to be an action 23 that -- you know, the MSPB is done and now you have a 24 certain number of days to take it to a court. So that's 25 the normal way you would read that language.
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MS. HARRINGTON: But -2 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you say no, it really, 3 you know, it includes some kinds of decisions and not 4 other kinds of decisions and the effect of that is that 5 it's really a switch as to which court you get to take 6 the action to, which is a very counterintuitive way to 7 read this language. 8 So I guess I'm asking you: Where do you 9 find the definition of the term of art? And I think 10 what your answer is going to be is this notion the board 11 shall decide the issue of discrimination and the 12 applicable action; is that correct. 13 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. Can I just take you 14 back one sentence to say, the point is not just that 15 the board is done, the point is that the board is done 16 under 7702; that it has issued a decision under 7702, 17 and so then, as you suggest, we look at 7702 and in that 18 provision Congress specifies various points at which a 19 final board decision under 7702 becomes a judicially 20 reviewable action. 21 The one that's relevant in this case is in 22 subsection (a)(3), which is on page 9a in the middle of 23 the page there. It says: "Any decision of the board 24 under paragraph (1)" -- so that's 7702(a)(1) -- "of this 25 subsection shall be a judicially reviewable action,
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 either when it's issued if the employee doesn't seek 2 EEOC review or when the EEOC declines to hear the case." 3 So in our view there are two indications in 4 (a)(3) that tell you that it has to be a decision on the 5 issue of discrimination in order to be a judicially 6 reviewable action -- action under section 7702. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: Why doesn't the language 8 that Justice Kagan referred to, the requirement that the 9 board within 120 days decide both the issue of 10 discrimination and the appealable action, mean that the 11 board has to dispose of both the issue of discrimination 12 and the appealable action, not that it must actually 13 adjudicate those two issues? 14 What if you have a threshold, you have a 15 threshold timeliness issue that is completely 16 dispositive? You're saying that this language means the 17 board nevertheless has to decide the merits of the 18 discrimination issue? 19 MS. HARRINGTON: No. I'm glad you asked 20 that question. The directive in section -- that you're 21 referring to is at the bottom of page 8a. The directive 22 is that the board shall decide both the issue of 23 discrimination and the appealable action in accordance 24 with the board's appellate procedures. 25 In this case the board complied with that
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 directive by not deciding the issue of discrimination 2 because the appeal was untimely. And I know that sounds 3 a little strange when I first say it, so let me give you 4 an analogous example. Imagine a State law that directed 5 the DMV to issue a driver's license to any applicant in 6 accordance -- in accordance with the procedures 7 governing such applications. If the DMV required that 8 driver's license applicants either pay a fee or submit 9 to an eye exam, you wouldn't expect that they would have 10 to issue a license to someone who refused to comply with 11 those requirements. In that case the DMV would comply 12 with the directive that it issue a license in accordance 13 with its procedures by not issuing a license at all. 14 And it's the same thing here. Here the 15 board complied with the directive that it decide the 16 issue of discrimination in accordance with its appellate 17 procedures by not deciding the issue of discrimination 18 and therefore not issuing a decision under 7703. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: You don't have to read it 20 that way, do you? I mean, look, it says in (a), it 21 says, let's take an employee who is affected adversely, 22 and then it says "alleges that the basis for the action 23 was discrimination," okay. In that case the board shall 24 within 120 days decide both the issue of discrimination 25 and the appealable action. So they decided it. They
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 decided it was out of time. They decided it was barred. 2 They decided da, da, da. 3 I mean, there are a lot of decisions on an 4 issue that a person raises in court and we don't 5 normally say they didn't decide the issue, the court. 6 It decided it. It decided it was untimely. 7 MS. HARRINGTON: But I think normally when a 8 court dismisses a case based on timeliness you don't 9 think of it as deciding the issue. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, I see. The 11 issue. They shall decide the issue of discrimination. 12 I mean, you can read it as saying they have to decide 13 the merits or you could read it as saying, there could 14 be several claims that went on below. Heard them, 15 decide the discrimination one. Now, you decide the 16 discrimination one. And I agree they used the word 17 "issue" instead of saying decide the discrimination 18 claim, that it says here, he alleges. They could have 19 said, decide the allegation. They could have said, 20 decide that part of the case. 21 But, I mean, why do we want to jump over 14 22 hurdles to give this narrow interpretation to that word 23 issue when all that's going to happen is we'll have a 24 new jurisprudence arising. 25 Is the dismissal on the ground that it was an
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 allegation of discrimination, that it wasn't enough to 2 really make out discrimination? It was partial summary 3 judgment. It was a dismissal on the basis of the 4 statement in the complaint. It was -- I mean, we can 5 think of 40 different things, perhaps, that are going to 6 be hard to distinguish as to whether they're procedural, 7 jurisdictional or on the merits. 8 And why do we want to get courts into that, when 9 the simplest thing is the person says, I allege 10 discrimination. There it is right in paragraph 1(b) of 11 his paper. The MSPB says, you lose for any reason on 12 that particular one, and now we go to the district 13 court. That's just so simple. 14 MS. HARRINGTON: That would certainly be 15 simpler. And if it were up to us to make up the rules, 16 maybe that's what we would decide. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, no. All we're 18 doing is interpreting what you've said is the word 19 issue, not to be quite so technical as to mean decide on 20 the merits, which it doesn't mean normally, but we're 21 interpreting it to mean decide the allegation that he 22 has raised that he was discriminated against. 23 MS. HARRINGTON: But what we're trying to do 24 is figure out how much of an exception Congress wanted 25 to create to the exclusive -- to the Federal circuit's
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 exclusive jurisdiction to review MSPB decisions. 2 In our view, its choice of the word issue is 3 important, because it's not just deciding the case that 4 alleges discrimination. It's the issue of 5 discrimination. 6 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry. 7 MS. HARRINGTON: I'm sorry. Go ahead. 8 There's another hint in paragraph (a)(3), 9 and let me know if you want to jump in, but not just the 10 direction to look at (a)(1), but paragraph (a)(3), 11 another hint that Congress was really talking about 12 cases where the board decides the issue of 13 discrimination. 14 In paragraph (a)(3), again, on (9)(a), 15 Congress provides that a judicially reviewable action 16 becomes -- becomes a judicially reviewable action when 17 the employee decides not to seek review from the EEOC or 18 when the EEOC decides not to take the case. 19 Now, the only types of decisions from the 20 board that the EEOC can review are decisions that reach 21 an issue of discrimination. And so it would be strange 22 to be talking about decisions under (a)(1) that the EEOC 23 could review if you're talking about decisions that 24 don't involve the issue of discrimination. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Harrington, may I
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 just clarify that if -- if the case goes to the MSPB, 2 and the MS -- the Federal circuit, the Federal circuit 3 agrees with the MSPB that this was untimely filed, 4 that's the end of the case, the discrimination claim 5 would never be heard then. 6 MS. HARRINGTON: I mean, the plaintiffs 7 could then file a suit in district court and seek 8 equitable tolling for having missed the deadline to file 9 from the date of the final agency decision. 10 And, in fact, that was one of the 11 alternative bases for jurisdiction that was asserted in 12 the district court below in this case. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if the Plaintiff then 14 goes to the district court, then what position does the 15 Government take? 16 MS. HARRINGTON: It depends on the case. In 17 this case, we argued against equitable tolling because, 18 in our view, she had missed the deadlines through her 19 own fault. But if there was some reason to think that 20 it wasn't really her fault for missing the deadlines for 21 appealing and -- so that even though her appeal to the 22 MSPB was, in fact, untimely, it wasn't really her fault, 23 then we might not resist equitable tolling. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper told us in 25 his brief, and he repeated it this morning, that the
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MSPB and the EEOC disagree with your reading of the 2 statute, that they think that the so-called mixed case 3 goes to the district court. 4 MS. HARRINGTON: I don't think that's 5 correct. I didn't hear him say that; but, if he said 6 that, I don't think -- I mean, I know it's not correct 7 that the EEOC and MSPB disagree with -8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, didn't -- in the 9 Ballentine case, didn't the MSPB take the position that 10 it didn't go to the Federal circuit? 11 MS. HARRINGTON: That was our position, you 12 know, I think it was 30 years ago now. And since the 13 Ballentine decision, the Government has had the other -14 has had the position that we're asserting today, which 15 is that the only -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so you -- are you -17 are you telling us that the position you're representing 18 on behalf of the Government is the position that the 19 MSPB would take today, is the position that the EEOC 20 would take today? 21 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. Yes. Our brief is 22 filed on behalf of all the agencies in the United States 23 that are affected by this. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, getting 25 back to judicially reviewable -
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. Excellent. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- even if I accept 3 your argument that that's not the same as subject to 4 judicial review, isn't it an odd backhanded way to get 5 to your position? 6 This is not something about -- a provision 7 about what's judicially reviewable and what's not. It's 8 a notice provision. It says these actions have to be 9 filed within 30 days after notice of judicial review. 10 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, but some -11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then you say 12 that judicial reviewability is the key linchpin that 13 bases your argument, when it's really just in a sentence 14 about notice. 15 MS. HARRINGTON: But it's in a provision 16 that's describing the exception to the general rule 17 that's set out in 7703. 18 So the general rule in 7703 is that when 19 you're talking about final board decisions, judicial 20 review of those decisions is in the Federal circuit. 21 And this is at 16(a) and 17(a) in the Government's 22 brief. It says, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2). 23 So when you're looking to (b)(2), you're 24 wondering -- you're asking what subset of final board 25 actions -- that's -- final order or decision -- that's
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 their language used in (a)(1) -- what subset of final 2 orders or decisions of the Merit Systems Protection 3 Board fall within (b)(2). 4 Now, in (b)(2), the only types of final 5 orders that are described there is at the end of the 6 section, judicially reviewable action under section 7 7702. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, yes, that's 9 where the phrase comes in, but it does seem an odd way 10 to establish that that is the critical element that 11 tells you which provisions you can take forward when it 12 just says your time is 30 days after you get notice of 13 judicial review. 14 MS. HARRINGTON: Under -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And here the 16 Government says, aha, judicial review, we think that 17 does not mean subject to judicial review. Judicially 18 reviewable doesn't mean subject to judicial review. 19 MS. HARRINGTON: So even if you throw out 20 the term of art -21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 22 MS. HARRINGTON: -- part of our argument, and all 23 you look at is the last two words of that sentence, 24 which is Section 7702, you still have to look at 7702 25 and figure out when Congress told you that a final board
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 decision could be subject to judicial review. 2 And the relevant place for this case where 3 it did that is in section (a)(3), which is on page 9a. 4 And there again, it points at (a)(1), which directs that 5 the Board decide the issue of discrimination. So it 6 says a decision under (a)(1) is -- is judicially 7 reviewable. If a decision does not reach the issue of 8 discrimination, it is not -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As of. See, it 10 shall be reviewable action as of. Again, it's just 11 going to the timeliness. 12 MS. HARRINGTON: Right. But again -- but 13 the two time triggers would only come into play if a 14 decision reached an issue of discrimination, because the 15 EEOC can't review issues -- can't review dismissals on 16 jurisdictional or procedural grounds. It can only -17 the EEOC's review of the board's -- of a board decision 18 is limited to its review of the board's interpretation 19 of an anti-discrimination law or its application of 20 those laws to a particular case. 21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Harrington, would you 22 agree that this is a remarkably strange way of Congress 23 trying to accomplish this objective? I mean, if 24 Congress were really saying we don't want procedural 25 determinations to go to the district court, that's a
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 very easy thing to say. Congress does not need to send 2 you -- you know, involve six different cross-references 3 and unnatural reading of statutory language. 4 And, you know, in the end, your argument 5 just is based on this notion that Congress used the word 6 decide rather than dispose of in this single provision. 7 The argument would completely collapse if that were not 8 the case. It just seems like if Congress wanted what 9 you say it wanted, Congress would not have done it in 10 this extremely complicated and backhanded way. 11 MS. HARRINGTON: I mean, I'm not going to 12 resist the idea that the CSRA is very complicated. I 13 mean, every case this Court has had about the CSRA, they 14 have remarked about how it is a complex statutory 15 scheme. 16 But I think Congress did accomplish in a 17 pretty simple way what you suggest, which is directing 18 that procedural rules should be reviewed in the Federal 19 circuit, and it did that by making that the background 20 rule. 21 In 7703(a) and (b)(1), it says, final 22 decisions of the board are reviewed in the Federal 23 circuit, full stop only, except as provided in (b)(2). 24 And then the question is, well, which of those decisions 25 fall within (b)(2).
44

1 In our view, you should not read that

2 exception more broadly than necessary to accommodate

3 employees' rights to have their discrimination claims

4 determined de novo in district court.

5 Here, the board decision, it decided two

6 things. First, was Petitioner's appeal to the board

7 timely; and, second, was there good cause to excuse her

8 untimeliness. There is no reason to think that Congress

9 would have wanted that Board decision to be reviewed

10 anywhere other than the Federal circuit.

The whole

11 point of having the Federal circuit is to have a unified

12 body of law governing certain things in the country that

13 Congress really thought should be directed to one place,

14 and that included board decisions.

15 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you're not -- the

16 Federal circuit didn't exist at the time that these

17 statutes were written, so what -- you know, really, it

18 would have been taken to the various courts of appeals,

19 and you wouldn't have gotten that uniformity anyway.

20 MS. HARRINGTON: Right, but you would have

21 had more uniformity than you would have had if the cases

22 had continued to go to the district court, which is

23 what -- which is what was happening before the CSRA, and

24 Congress specifically wanted to stop that process.

25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't have a quarrel

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 with your opposing counsel's position that once the 2 Board decides the CSRA claim and the discrimination 3 claim, the district court reviews both? 4 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Justice Alito was 6 questioning that, but you don't quarrel with that. 7 MS. HARRINGTON: We don't quarrel with it. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the lack of 9 uniformity is inherent in this structure. You just want 10 to carve out one piece of it that -11 MS. HARRINGTON: No -12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that you say deserves 13 more uniformity. 14 MS. HARRINGTON: It is -- it is true that a 15 small range of procedural issues governing the board's 16 procedures might be heard in district court, but it is 17 truly a very small universe of issues bordering on 18 non-existent, and let me explain why. As suggested 19 here, the only reason -- the only way it would come up 20 is as part of an affirmative defense by the agency, a 21 defense of exhaustion. But then generally speaking it 22 would have to be a procedural issue that the Government, 23 that the agency raised before the board and the board 24 rejected. 25 Now, the board's own regulations allow the
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 board to waive any of its -- any of its regulatory 2 requirements, including timeliness, for good cause. And 3 so the Government would have to argue in the district 4 court that essentially the board abused its discretion 5 by not waiving a procedural objection, and that's a very 6 high hurdle and I think it's really hard to imagine very 7 many cases in which that's going to come up, where the 8 Government's going to make that kind of argument. So 9 although there's -- there's potential, there's a 10 potential for a tiny bit of erosion of uniformity under 11 our view, it is really a small universe of issues that 12 could go to district court. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything you want 14 to say on the question of which is worse? That is to 15 say, I get your point on the word "issue," and I think 16 you can read the word "issue" to say there is a 17 contested point as to whether there was discrimination 18 or to say there is a contested point between the parties 19 as to whether the MSPB -- whether the plaintiff has a -20 has a legal right before the MSPB to get the lower -21 the agency reversed on the issue of discrimination. 22 The latter way favors your opponent, the 23 former favors you; okay. So we could do either, I 24 guess. 25 The one way, if you win, there will be a
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 body of law about what counts as procedural and what 2 doesn't. That sounds confusing to me. If you lose, I 3 quite agree with you that there will then be different 4 courts deciding different procedural matters, where 5 you'd get more uniformity out of the Federal Circuit. 6 Okay. Do you have anything to say about which of those 7 two evils is worse? Is there any reason -8 MS. HARRINGTON: Absolutely. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Have we any way of knowing? 10 MS. HARRINGTON: I mean, I think Congress 11 made the determination. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: -- going back to the 13 language, and so far, in my hypothetical anyway, I think 14 the language at best might be read, that word "issue," 15 the way you say, but need not be. 16 MS. HARRINGTON: But I think you can resolve 17 the ambiguity in the use of the word "issue" by looking 18 at the rest of (a)(3), which again ties the decision 19 under (a)(1) to reviewability by the EEOC. I don't 20 think there is any dispute that the EEOC can only review 21 board decisions that involve an issue of discrimination, 22 either an interpretation of an antidiscrimination law or 23 an application of such a law to the facts of the case. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have a problem, 25 because to accept your reading is to say that judicially
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 reviewable action differs between 7702 and the escape 2 hatch, because the only way the escape hatch can work, 3 it, too, cross-references 7702 in the same way that the 4 provisions you are relying on do. Under your reading 5 both should be given identical meaning, because they 6 both cross-reference 7702; and yet your brief says, no, 7 we shouldn't have that absurd result. 8 MS. HARRINGTON: But not because -9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It seems to me that if 10 you concede that there is an absurd result in applying 11 your interpretation to the escape hatch, by definition, 12 your meaning can't be ascribable to that phrase. 13 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, so just to be clear, 14 we think the phrase "judicially reviewable action" 15 should be given the same meaning in section (e) that it 16 is given elsewhere in 7702. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if the board -18 MS. HARRINGTON: Our view is -19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So when does the time 20 frames of the escape hatch commence -21 MS. HARRINGTON: So -22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- if the board hasn't 23 rendered any decision on anything? 24 MS. HARRINGTON: Exactly. If the -- if the 25 appeal is still pending before the board, that's when
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the escape hatch of (e) comes in, because it's just 2 intended to prevent employees from being held hostage by 3 board inaction. 4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Right, but Justice Sotomayor 5 is right, that when you define "judicially reviewable 6 action" in your way, then 7702(e)(1)(B) becomes 7 nonsensical and you have to save it by inserting 8 additional language, by saying, you know, "and other" -9 "and other kinds of action." 10 MS. HARRINGTON: No, it only becomes 11 nonsensical if you think it should apply to cases that 12 are no longer pending before the board under section 13 7702. In our view, once the board issued a decision -14 the decision in this case, it issued a decision under 15 section 7701 which is the general provision governing 16 board decisions, and then the case was no longer pending 17 under section 7702. And so it wouldn't make sense to 18 apply the escape hatch to cases in that situation. 19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it wouldn't make 20 sense, but it's what the language would command if 21 "judicially reviewable action" means what you say 22 "judicially reviewable action" means. 23 MS. HARRINGTON: It is true that our 24 commonsense gloss on the statute is not found in the 25 text of the statute. But I think once the -- once the
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 case has been decided under section 7701 on procedural 2 grounds, it's no longer a 7702 case before the board. 3 And so there is just no reason to think that subsection 4 (e) would apply in the -- in that situation. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You still have an 6 exhaustion argument to raise if we were to send this to 7 the district court? 8 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, we raised that 9 exhaustion argument as an alternative ground before the 10 district court. The district court construed this case 11 as seeking review of the board's decision, not seeking 12 review of the agency's decision. Petitioner did not 13 challenge that district court holding before the eighth 14 circuit in her opening brief. She didn't flag that as 15 issue in the cert petition papers, and so I think, although 16 now she's suggested in the merits briefing that this case -17 this Court maybe should really just decide whether she's 18 seeking review of the agency decision instead of the 19 board decision, in our view that's not really a question 20 that is presented in -- in the case any longer. In our 21 view she is seeking review over the board decision, the 22 board decision decided that her appeal was untimely, 23 that there wasn't good cause to excuse the untimeliness. 24 There is no indication anywhere in the statute that 25 Congress would have wanted that kind of board decision
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to be reviewed anywhere other than the Federal Circuit. 2 And so in our view it does not fall within -- in the 3 exception to exclusive Federal Circuit jurisdiction 4 provided in (b)(2) because it does not decide the issue 5 of discrimination. 6 If there are no further questions? 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. 8 Harrington. 9 Mr. Schnapper you have 4 minutes left. 10 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER 11 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 12 MR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 13 it please the Court: 14 I would like to answer the question that the 15 Chief Justice asked yesterday morning in Lozman. You -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You better remind 17 me. 18 (Laughter). 19 MR. SCHNAPPER: I -- I am happy to do so, 20 Your Honor. You pointed out that -- that where subject 21 matter jurisdiction is concerned, is it important that 22 rules be clear? And you asked counsel for Respondent, 23 why was Respondent's rule clearer than the Petitioner's 24 rule? 25 In this case our rule is demonstrably
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 clearer. The question is which mixed-cases go to the 2 district court? Our answer is all. The Government's 3 answer, the rule that is derived from Ballentine, has 4 confounded the lower courts since Ballentine and those 5 problems are reflected in the divergent accounts of the 6 rule in the Government's brief. There are more than 7 half a dozen of these problems. 8 First, the courts are divided below, as is 9 the Government's brief, about whether the Government's 10 rule applies to all procedural issues or only to 11 procedural issues that arise before the court reaches 12 the merits. For example, in -- in Hopkins v. MSPB, 13 after the court had resolved the merits, there was a 14 dispute about counsel fees and an argument that the 15 counsel fee application was untimely. The Government 16 took the position that that timeliness issue belonged in 17 the district court. 18 Secondly, the lower courts are divided as is 19 the Government's brief about whether a procedural issue 20 that is related to or intertwined with the merits goes 21 to the district court or the court of appeals. There is 22 a line of cases holding that a -- a -- when the MSPB 23 holds there is no jurisdiction because the 24 discrimination claim is frivolous, that's a procedural 25 jurisdiction issue, it's not a merits issue. And if you
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 look at the opinion in Hill v. Department of the Air 2 Force, you see a lengthy description of Title VII law, 3 in McDonnell Douglas v. Green, in the course of a 4 decision by the Federal Circuit holding there is no 5 jurisdiction. 6 Third, it is unclear what constitutes the 7 line between a merits decision and a procedural decision 8 issue. Some things are really neither. For example, 9 there are recurring disputes about whether a settlement 10 was voluntary. Well, it's not the merits of the 11 discrimination case, but it's not procedural in any 12 normal sense of the word. 13 Fourth, there are cases which involve 14 several claims resolved on several different bases. We 15 noted some of them in our reply brief. One -- one claim 16 was rejected on jurisdictional grounds; one claim was 17 rejected on res judicata and one claim was decided by 18 the board on the merits. It's unclear how that would 19 go. 20 There are also situations in which two cases 21 get filed, one of which -- and they are related cases, 22 and they go to the same judge, and one -- one involved 23 an MSPB decision on procedural grounds, one on the 24 merits. The court in that case just thought it ought to 25 just keep them both. It's not clear how that comes out.

SCHNAPPER: Okay. The -- the -- an 19 MSPB, ALJ, or the board itself could resolve a claim on 20 alternative grounds, as judges do all the time, and say, 21 well, we think this is time barred, but we also find 22 that it lacks the merits. I know where that goes. 23 There is also a problem, which the briefs 24 address, about factual disputes that arise with regard 25 to jurisdiction or procedure. The -- 7703(c) says,
55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 "Questions of fact get decided de novo." What does that 2 mean? 3 If there -- let's take, for example, a case 4 in which the claim is that a charge wasn't filed on time 5 with the agency. That's a question of fact. The agency 6 might find that it was timely -- there could be a 7 dispute of fact about when the violation occurred which 8 triggers the limitation period. The agency would make a 9 finding of fact. The MSPB might affirm that finding. 10 The Government tells us they would affirm whatever the 11 agency did. The statute seems to say that's got to be 12 decided de novo, the Federal circuit can't do that. 13 Thank you. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 15 The case is submitted. 16 (Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in the 17 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
