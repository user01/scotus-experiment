 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 first this morning in No. 02-469, The Black & Decker
 5 Disability Plan v. Kenneth Nord.
 6 Mr. Paterson.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE T. PATERSON
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 9 MR. PATERSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 10 please the Court:
 11 The Ninth Circuit has adopted a treating
 12 physician rule in ERISA cases which requires the plan
 13 administrator to either accept the opinion of a treating
 14 physician or to reject that opinion by specific legitimate
 15 reasons based upon substantial evidence. 
 The Ninth 16 Circuit says that this rule gives special weight,
 17 deference, and a presumption to the opinions of treating
 18 physicians.
 19 The failure to follow this rule has two effects. 
 20 First, a finding that the plan administrator has a
 21 conflict of interest which mandates de novo review, and
 22 secondly, on de novo review, that the plan administrator's
 23 decision was not reasonable.
 24 The Ninth Circuit's --
 25 QUESTION: Now, the Secretary has adopted some

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 requirements of explanation of reasons where the
 2 physicians differ in their views. Has -- has the
 3 Secretary done something of the sort?
 4 MR. PATERSON: The Secretary has adopted
 5 regulations, which were effective in January 1 of 2002,
 6 which require a plan administrator to obtain the opinion
 7 of an expert medical professional to -- to advise him
 8 regarding medical opinions and to be able to provide an
 9 expert medical opinion to the claimant if he requests it. 
 10 That would not apply, of course, to this case since this
 11 claim was filed in 1997.
 12 QUESTION: And is there a requirement to give
 13 reasons if there is a difference of views between the
 14 treating physician and the expert?
 15 MR. PATERSON: No. 
 There is no requirement to 16 provide reasons to -- or between the two physicians'
 17 opinions. There has always been a requirement under ERISA
 18 and the regulations that a plan administrator explain the
 19 reasons for his denial of a claim.
 20 QUESTION: And this claim was denied?
 21 MR. PATERSON: This claim was denied.
 22 QUESTION: Were the reasons given in this case?
 23 MR. PATERSON: Yes, they were, Your Honor. They
 24 were given by the plan administrator in writing to the
 25 claimant. He told the claimant that he was, in fact,

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 denying the claim based on the opinion of Dr. Mitri.
 2 He told them he was denying the claim because he
 3 did not meet the plan definition of total -- I'm sorry --
 4 complete inability to perform the job of a material
 5 planner.
 6 He told them that part of the reason for denying
 7 the claim was the fact that the plan administrator had
 8 asked the claimant to please have his treating physicians
 9 comment on the opinion of Dr. Mitri. He did that twice. 
 10 He did it in writing. And in neither case did the
 11 respondent respond with any -- from the treating
 12 physicians -- with any response from their -- the treating
 13 physicians.
 14 And he also did it on the basis that Janmarie
 15 Forward's opinion, who was a human resource
 16 representative, was not -- did not change his opinion. So
 17 there were those --
 18 QUESTION: And -- and under the Secretary's
 19 rules, if there is in fact a conflict of interest, it can
 20 be weighed in making that ultimate resolution by the
 21 court?
 22 MR. PATERSON: No. There's -- there's nothing
 23 in the -- if you mean the Secretary of Labor's rules,
 24 there's nothing in the Secretary of Labor's rules which
 25 relates to any weighing of a conflict of interest by the

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 plan administrator. There is a -- a provision in the case
 2 of Firestone v. Bruch in which the Court in that case said
 3 that if the plan administrator --
 4 QUESTION: This Court has suggested that a
 5 conflict of interest can be weighed.
 6 MR. PATERSON: This Court said that in Firestone
 7 v. Bruch.
 8 And -- but the question in that case that has
 9 been not -- it has not been decided in that case and which
 10 has created a conflict of interest of -- I'm sorry -- a
 11 conflict among the circuits is the question of what does
 12 it mean to weigh. Does it mean to weigh the conflict of
 13 interest, or does it mean to conflict of interest against
 14 the reasonableness of the decision?
 15 The Second Circuit has said it means to weigh 16 the conflict of interest as provided in Restatement 187,
 17 and after you weigh the conflict of interest, you then
 18 move on to the reasonableness of the decision.
 19 The Ninth -- the Ninth and the Eleventh Circuits
 20 have said it means that you weigh the decision, and if you
 21 -- the conflict -- and if you find there is a conflict,
 22 then you find that the decision of the plan administrator
 23 is presumptively void.
 24 And the remainder of the circuits have adopted
 25 something called the sliding scale test where you weigh

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 both the conflict and the -- the reasonableness of the
 2 decision at the same time.
 3 This Court commented on that issue, I believe,
 4 in Rush v. Moran when the Court said, how can you give
 5 deference to the opinion of a treating physician -- I'm
 6 sorry -- of a plan administrator at the same time that you
 7 are looking for conflict of interest?
 8 We would submit, if I may, Your Honor, that the
 9 way to do that is to first look for conflict of interest
 10 in -- in the -- the way that Restatement 187 does that. 
 11 You first test for conflict of interest. If there's no
 12 conflict of interest, then this potential conflict of
 13 interest, what this Court called a potential conflict of
 14 interest, goes away. It is a nothing. It has no effect
 15 whatsoever.
 16 QUESTION: You didn't tell us -- you didn't --
 17 QUESTION: As to your case, what -- what
 18 difference does it really make? The Ninth Circuit in a
 19 portion of -- of its opinion which is not being reviewed
 20 here --
 21 MR. PATERSON: I didn't mean to --
 22 QUESTION: -- and -- and in Regula seems to set
 23 up a two-tier system or a dichotomy of an administrator
 24 who is a fiduciary and an administrator who's not. I
 25 should think -- tell me, maybe I'm incorrect -- that your

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 position is that the treating physician rule is an
 2 inappropriate approach in either instance.
 3 MR. PATERSON: There's no question about that. 
 4 I didn't mean to argue for a difference in -- in the
 5 standard of review. We haven't -- we haven't brought that
 6 to this Court on a petition. I merely meant to respond to
 7 Justice O'Connor's question.
 8 QUESTION: But I take it your point is that in
 9 -- in either context, the treating physician rule is
 10 inappropriate.
 11 MR. PATERSON: Absolutely. There's no question
 12 in our -- in our position to this Court that the treating
 13 physician rule is an inappropriate rule under either -- of
 14 any of those tests.
 15 QUESTION: Am -- am I --
 16 QUESTION: If you are correct in -- in that
 17 regard, it would go back to the Ninth Circuit and there
 18 would still remain the question on which you didn't seek
 19 review, and that is, just how do you handle this conflict
 20 of interest? I presume the Ninth Circuit would go back to
 21 where it was.
 22 MR. PATERSON: I believe that that's correct,
 23 Your Honor. What would happen is we would go back to
 24 where we would have been if the treating physician rule
 25 didn't exist. The Ninth Circuit would be using its

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 presumptively void test, would look to see if the -- the
 2 claimant had produced any probative material evidence of a
 3 conflict of interest, which actually affected the decision
 4 as opposed to just a potential conflict of interest. If
 5 they found that, they would find that the decision of the
 6 plan administrator was presumptively void. If they didn't
 7 find that, then that issue would drop from the case and
 8 they would then test the -- the decision of a plan
 9 administrator based on abuse of discretion standard.
 10 QUESTION: But their analysis would be different
 11 in one respect, I take it, and that is in -- in the case
 12 as they considered it first, the -- the refusal to follow
 13 a treating physician rule was taken itself as evidence of
 14 conflict. Is that correct?
 15 MR. PATERSON: Yes. 
 The Ninth Circuit held that 16 the refusal to follow a treating -- the treating
 17 physician's opinion or to fail to rebut that opinion by
 18 specific legitimate reasons was a material probative
 19 evidence of a -- tending to prove an actual conflict of
 20 interest which -- which affected the --
 21 QUESTION: So the result might be different.
 22 MR. PATERSON: I -- we would certainly -- we
 23 certainly intend it to be different if -- if we can.
 24 QUESTION: Did -- did they say presumptively
 25 void? I -- I had thought that what they -- what they said

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 was if they found an actual conflict, they simply would
 2 give no deference and would review de novo as though the
 3 question was up to them.
 4 MR. PATERSON: The -- the test in the literature
 5 is called the presumptively void test. I don't believe
 6 the Ninth Circuit calls it the presumptively void test. 
 7 They -- they call it the Atwood test, the Atwood v.
 8 Newmont Gold test.
 9 QUESTION: I don't care what they call it. I
 10 want to know what the consequence is. I thought the
 11 consequence held by the Ninth Circuit was that if they did
 12 find the actual conflict, they would give no deference to
 13 the plan administrator's decision and would review the
 14 question de novo as though it was up to them.
 15 MR. PATERSON: 
 Yes, and in that sense it would 16 -- they would be void. I think the presumptively void
 17 issue comes in this sense, Your Honor. When the -- if the
 18 claimant comes forward with material probative evidence of
 19 a conflict tending to show a conflict of interest under
 20 the Ninth Circuit's test, the Ninth Circuit says that
 21 there is a rebuttable presumption created and that the
 22 burden is then on the plan administrator to come forward
 23 with evidence and to rebut that material probative
 24 evidence that there is an actual conflict of interest.
 25 QUESTION: But we take the case on the theory

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 that that's governing in this case? I mean, you didn't --
 2 MR. PATERSON: Yes.
 3 QUESTION: -- seek -- seek review of it. It's
 4 just the treating physician rule that you want us to talk
 5 about.
 6 MR. PATERSON: That's correct. I -- I don't --
 7 I've been asked these questions, but we're not arguing the
 8 issue of standard --
 9 QUESTION: It is difficult for me to get to the
 10 thing when I have a kind of basic confusion in my mind,
 11 which I have. I don't understand this conflict of
 12 interest thing from start to finish. That is to say, why
 13 -- why is it -- why is it any different to have a trustee
 14 in -- in this kind of a case who hires an insurance
 15 company to look to see whether the people are disabled or 16 not than to have a trustee who hires an insurance company
 17 to run the whole plan?
 18 And anyway, why is that different from a trustee
 19 who, say, runs a classical trust and has to decide -- call
 20 it a spendthrift trust -- whether to give the beneficiary
 21 $1,000 this month and have less in the -- in the corpus or
 22 to give him $800 this month and have more in the corpus,
 23 which might, by the way, grow to help other beneficiaries?
 24 So I -- I don't understand it basically and I've
 25 read enough to know that I really don't.

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. PATERSON: Thank you, Justice Breyer. I --
 2 I hope that I can -- I can help.
 3 In section 187 of the Restatement of Trusts, it
 4 talks about a potential conflict of interest, the
 5 possibility of a conflict of interest. And this -- this
 6 Court talked about that in Firestone v. Bruch. That
 7 potential conflict of interest is not a conflict of
 8 interest. It's just the possibility. And any court
 9 reviewing any trustee, ERISA or not, if they thought there
 10 might be a conflict of interest, would look for that
 11 conflict of interest and see if there was --
 12 QUESTION: What could it consist of?
 13 MR. PATERSON: It might consist in an ERISA case
 14 of some direction from the president of the company to the
 15 trustee to cut back on benefit costs.
 16 QUESTION: I see. I see.
 17 MR. PATERSON: That would be -- then he would
 18 not be representing the -- the members of the plan and he
 19 would be breaching his fiduciary duty.
 20 QUESTION: What if there's no such directive,
 21 but the plan is set up in such a fashion that it's
 22 employer-funded and the higher the benefit costs are, the
 23 -- the more the employer pays, and hence the less profits
 24 the employer has?
 25 MR. PATERSON: That's -- I'm sorry.

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Is that just a potential conflict of
 2 interest or is that an actual conflict of interest when
 3 the plan administrator is -- is an agent of the employer?
 4 MR. PATERSON: Under this Court's rule -- or
 5 decision in Firestone and in -- under the Ninth Circuit's
 6 decision, that is only a potential conflict of interest. 
 7 There has to be material probative evidence of an actual
 8 conflict of interest which affected his decision.
 9 QUESTION: It's using conflict of interest in a
 10 -- in a strange sense, it seems to me.
 11 MR. PATERSON: It -- well --
 12 QUESTION: There's certainly a conflict of
 13 interest there. He's supposed to represent the employees,
 14 but he's an agent of the employer, and the more he gives
 15 to the employees, the less there is for the employer. I
 16 would call that a conflict of interest, but -- but that is
 17 not, for purposes of these cases, a conflict of interest.
 18 That is a potential conflict.
 19 MR. PATERSON: That is a potential conflict of
 20 interest.
 21 QUESTION: It seems to me they're not really
 22 talking about a conflict of interest. They're talking
 23 about -- what should I say? Evidence that -- that the
 24 trustee was not acting in the -- in the employees' best
 25 interest.

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. PATERSON: And I think that should be the --
 2 the criteria that the court has to look for in each of
 3 these cases to decide whether the trustee is actually
 4 conflicted or not.
 5 QUESTION: Can we get back to the question that
 6 you did raise? Why should there be a difference in the
 7 Social Security standard, which does apply this treating
 8 physician rule and disability? Both -- the question in
 9 both cases is whether this person is unable to work.
 10 MR. PATERSON: There is a -- I'm sorry.
 11 QUESTION: Yes.
 12 MR. PATERSON: There's a tremendous difference
 13 in the Social Security standard as formulated by the
 14 regulations of the Social Security Administration and the
 15 Ninth Circuit's treating physician rule in Social Security 16 cases as formulated by the Ninth Circuit and ERISA cases. 
 17 Perhaps I can point out a couple of those things.
 18 First, the Social Security Administration has a
 19 regulation, which it has adopted, which provides for a set
 20 of criteria to be reviewed by the administrative law
 21 judge. Those criteria include the -- looking at the
 22 physician's -- the treating physician's opinion,
 23 determining whether that opinion is well supported by
 24 clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, seeing if
 25 it's not inconsistent with other substantial evidence,

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 looking at the length of the treatment relationship and
 2 the frequency of the examination, and other criteria.
 3 Once the administrative law judge goes through
 4 those criteria and determines each one of those positively
 5 towards the treating physician, he then may, or she may
 6 then, if they wish, provide conclusive weight to the
 7 opinion of the treating physician.
 8 The Ninth Circuit's rule is completely different
 9 than that. The Ninth Circuit's rule says that if a person
 10 is a treating physician, then the plan administrator
 11 either has to accept that rule -- that -- that opinion or
 12 has to rebut it. A treating physician under the Ninth
 13 Circuit rule could be a -- somebody at a local well care
 14 center and you walk in and get a shot. That makes you a 
 15 treating physician. 
 Now you have an opinion which you -16 which, under the Ninth Circuit's rule, gives you a -- a
 17 presumptive weight.
 18 QUESTION: But I take it, you would not be happy
 19 with -- if we said, well, the Ninth Circuit went too far,
 20 but it should be set up just like the Social Security
 21 because, as I understand it, this employee did get Social
 22 Security disability.
 23 MR. PATERSON: Well, we don't know that for a
 24 fact, Your Honor. There is a statement in the -- in the
 25 statement of facts by the respondent in their opposition

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 brief. There is no evidence in front of this Court. The
 2 first time I ever knew about that was when I read the
 3 respondent's brief. If that is true, he should file -- he
 4 should refile with the administrator and attempt to use
 5 that evidence to get his claim reopened. But there is no
 6 evidence that I'm aware of in front of this Court on that
 7 issue.
 8 QUESTION: So that's -- that is open to him to
 9 refile and say, look, I've got Social Security?
 10 MR. PATERSON: Yes. He may go back to the --
 11 the plan administrator -- this case is still open because
 12 it's on appeal -- and tell the plan administrator I have
 13 this new evidence. It shows that I have been disabled
 14 since July the 15th of 1997 and I would like you to
 15 consider that evidence. 
 And the plan administrator will 16 do that.
 17 QUESTION: I suppose there's something to be
 18 said for the proposition that if you have this private
 19 system, you don't necessarily want to bring in all the
 20 bureaucratic trappings of the Social Security review
 21 process.
 22 MR. PATERSON: Well, I think that's absolutely
 23 right, because one of the congressional purposes in ERISA
 24 is to encourage employers to adopt voluntary disability
 25 plans. And the Social Security administrative regulations

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 were -- are regulations which have been adopted by the
 2 Social Security Administration. In this case, the
 3 Department of Labor which is the correlative to the Social
 4 Security Administration for ERISA plans is opposed to the
 5 ERISA, or to this --
 6 QUESTION: But -- but you -- you would
 7 acknowledge that the Social Security determination is
 8 evidence for the plan administrator to consider even
 9 though it's using a -- a mandated standard of respect for
 10 the treating physician's determination which does not
 11 exist under the plan?
 12 MR. PATERSON: I think it is evidence. I think
 13 the first thing the plan administrator would do is to look
 14 at the medical opinions which were submitted along with
 15 that report and look at the actual decision of the 16 administrative law judge.
 17 QUESTION: But he'd make -- make the same
 18 decision. I mean, if he didn't believe the treating
 19 physician and didn't have to believe the treating
 20 physician, as the Social Security Administrator has to, to
 21 a greater degree anyway, he'd come out the same way. I
 22 just don't see how it's evidence in a -- in a proceeding
 23 that does not give the same weight to the treating
 24 physician.
 25 MR. PATERSON: It might or might not be. But it

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 if -- if it is -- if it does show that there's a
 2 difference in the condition of the -- of the claimant, it
 3 should be presented to the plan administrator to give him
 4 a chance to make the decision.
 5 QUESTION: It's a different record before the
 6 Social -- the ALJ.
 7 MR. PATERSON: That's correct.
 8 QUESTION: It's later in time.
 9 MR. PATERSON: With the permission of the Court,
 10 I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.
 11 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Paterson.
 12 Ms. Blatt, we'll hear from you.
 13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT
 14 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,
 15 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
 16 QUESTION: Ms. Blatt, did the Secretary consider
 17 adopting a rule like CA9 has imposed?
 18 MS. BLATT: No, Justice O'Connor. What the
 19 Secretary has done has -- is -- has not opposed -- imposed
 20 a treating physician requirement or otherwise constrained
 21 plan administrators in the way --
 22 QUESTION: Yes. I know the Secretary has not. 
 23 Did the Secretary consider alternatives?
 24 MS. BLATT: They didn't consider a treating
 25 physician rule, but what the Department of Labor did do

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 was impose a series of requirements to ensure fair and
 2 accurate decisionmaking. So plans must conduct a full and
 3 fair review of a claim, and they have to consider all
 4 evidence submitted by the claimant. And before making any
 5 medical judgments, they have to consult with a health care
 6 professional with the relevant training and experience.
 7 QUESTION: The question was when they did that,
 8 did they even think of the treating physician rule? Did
 9 anybody say to the Department, maybe we should have one? 
 10 No, I don't think we will.
 11 MS. BLATT: No. There's no evidence that they
 12 considered it. But they did overhaul their regulations
 13 for 2002 and did impose a lot of requirements, and they
 14 took a very different approach. They didn't do anything
 15 that constrained plan administrators in weighing evidence. 16 Instead, they said, you have to consider all the relevant
 17 evidence and make an independent judgment. And then they
 18 finally required that the specific reasons have to be
 19 given for any denial in a manner that's calculated to be
 20 understood by the claimant. And in the Department's view,
 21 what that means is it has to be in sufficient detail to
 22 permit meaningful judicial review for an abuse of
 23 discretion.
 24 But the Ninth Circuit takes a very different and
 25 categorical approach that singles out treating physician

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 evidence and has a requirement that reasons have to be
 2 given if the administrator is not going to defer to that
 3 evidence.
 4 QUESTION: Maybe the Ninth Circuit was trying to
 5 spark for ERISA the same thing that the courts did for
 6 Social Security. The Social Security -- whatever the rule
 7 is, the treating physician rule -- that started with the
 8 courts and then the -- the Commissioner said, okay, we'll
 9 adopt it as part of our regulations. But didn't it begin
 10 with the courts?
 11 MS. BLATT: It began with the courts, and they
 12 -- most of them did impose some requirement and some
 13 outright rejected it because they thought Congress had
 14 entrusted the ALJ as the finder of fact with the
 15 responsibility to weigh conflicting evidence. And the
 16 Commissioner, in order to bring uniformity in this massive
 17 nationwide Government program, adopted a less aggressive,
 18 deferential rule in its regulations.
 19 But the Department of Labor has not adopted any
 20 such rule. Rather, the Department of Labor's regulations
 21 are consistent with the background presumption that the
 22 trier of fact has the responsibility in each particular
 23 case to weigh conflicting evidence based on her judgment
 24 of the relative merits of the evidence. And -- but the
 25 Department of Labor, as I said, has a very different set

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 of requirements that don't -- that leave -- that are
 2 consistent with that background rule and don't constrain
 3 plan administrators.
 4 QUESTION: Does the -- do the Department
 5 regulations have some sort of a threshold test for whether
 6 there's a conflict of interest or is that just not
 7 addressed?
 8 MS. BLATT: No. The Department of --
 9 regulations don't speak to the question of a conflict at
 10 all. What this Court said in Firestone was that a
 11 conflict must be weighed as a factor in determining
 12 whether there's been an abuse of discretion.
 13 QUESTION: And Firestone, as I recall, just
 14 recognized that the plan administrator can wear two hats,
 15 be employer some times and -- and a fiduciary at others. 16 MS. BLATT: That's right. But under Firestone,
 17 if the employer both funds the plan and administers the
 18 plan, we think that's the type of conflict that can be
 19 considered as a factor in whether there's been an abuse of
 20 discretion.
 21 QUESTION: So Firestone was using conflict of
 22 interest in -- in a different sense from the sense in
 23 which it was used here.
 24 MS. BLATT: The courts have differed widely, in
 25 the wake of Firestone, of what this Court meant in

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Firestone. The majority of the lower courts have not
 2 taken the Ninth Circuit's approach. They have said it's
 3 still an abuse of discretion review, but there's a more
 4 searching inquiry into whether there's been an abuse of
 5 discretion if the plan administrator is operating under a
 6 conflict.
 7 Now, that is not --
 8 QUESTION: By which it means not evidence that
 9 he was instructed to -- to keep down costs, but the mere
 10 fact that the employer is both the funder of the plan and
 11 responsible for administration of the plan.
 12 MS. BLATT: That's correct.
 13 QUESTION: That alone is a conflict.
 14 MS. BLATT: That's the type of conflict that can
 15 be considered as a factor in conducting whether there's an 16 abuse of discretion.
 17 Now, however that plays out in a given case, our
 18 point is that you shouldn't have a special rule that's
 19 limited to treating physician evidence. And we think it's
 20 inappropriate under ERISA for three reasons, and I think
 21 I've already said two of them --
 22 QUESTION: What does treating physician evidence
 23 have to do with a conflict? That's -- that's what I
 24 really don't understand.
 25 MS. BLATT: Nothing.

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: How does it show a conflict at all?
 2 MS. BLATT: Nothing. If there was some failure
 3 to defer or inadequate explanation -- first of all,
 4 there's something wrong with the treating physician rule. 
 5 But even if there was some inadequate explanation such
 6 that the court could not conduct meaningful judicial
 7 review, the standard consequence of that, Justice Scalia,
 8 is a remand back to the administrator for further
 9 explanation, not a de novo standard of review.
 10 But that's not the question presented in this
 11 case. It's rather the propriety of a judge-made rule that
 12 singles out treating physician evidence and elevates that
 13 evidence over other evidence.
 14 Now, again, it's inconsistent with the
 15 background presumption about the trier of fact -- the 16 responsibility of the trier of fact to weigh conflicting
 17 evidence. We think it's in significant tension with the
 18 regulations that the Department of Labor did promulgate
 19 which do not constrain plan administrators.
 20 And finally, the third reason, is that ERISA
 21 leaves to employers, private employers, the decision
 22 whether to provide benefits and, if so, the discretion to
 23 devise the form and structure of plans. And a judge-made
 24 rule is inconsistent with these discretionary and
 25 voluntary aspects of ERISA because it tells plan

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 administrators across the board how to weigh conflicting
 2 evidence in claims arising under varying and separate
 3 plans.
 4 QUESTION: Would it be relevant evidence, as Mr.
 5 Paterson suggested it would be, that this man now has
 6 Social Security disability benefits?
 7 MS. BLATT: The regulations require the plan
 8 administrator to consider all evidence submitted by the
 9 claimant, and it -- it would be relevant if -- depending
 10 on what it said. But this Court in Cleveland has
 11 explained that the Commissioner of Social Security applies
 12 a variety of evidentiary presumptions, not only the
 13 treating physician rule but the most prominent one is the
 14 listing of impairments such that the Social Security
 15 Administration may make a finding of disability even 16 though the person in fact may be able to perform the
 17 essential functions of the job when judged under different
 18 legal settings. And I think the issue in -- in Cleveland
 19 was whether there was reasonable accommodation, and the
 20 Commissioner doesn't consider that when -- when she makes
 21 her determinations under the Social Security
 22 Administration. But it's just -- it's one piece of
 23 evidence that would be before the administrator.
 24 And if there are no further questions, we would
 25 ask that the judgment of the Ninth Circuit be reversed.

1 QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Blatt.
 2 Mr. Rohlfing, we'll hear from you.
 3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE D. ROHLFING
 4 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 5 MR. ROHLFING: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
 6 may it please the Court:
 7 In answer to Judge -- Justice Scalia's question
 8 about conflict of interest, the lower courts, in the wake
 9 of Firestone Tire & Rubber Company v. Bruch, have grossly
 10 confused the concept of conflict of interest, dollar-for-
 11 dollar conflict of interest, with actual bias. And that's
 12 the problem with the Ninth Circuit's approach, the
 13 Eleventh Circuit's approach and the other circuits'
 14 approach, is when we have evidence of conflict of
 15 interest, the courts are requiring evidence of actual 16 bias. And I don't believe that that's the standard that
 17 this Court intended in the Firestone Tire & Rubber case.
 18 Now, the other --
 19 QUESTION: In Firestone -- is -- is it a
 20 conflict of interest if I set up a trust for my children
 21 to pay their college education, and then I have to make
 22 decisions. Suppose I hire a trustee and that -- or I hire
 23 somebody to run it, and I'm going to put more in if they
 24 need more, less, if they need less. So the trustee has to
 25 say whether to pay for the $80 a month or a week or

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 whatever, a day's spending money or not, and the more he
 2 pays, the more I'm going to have to put in. Is -- is that
 3 considered, under -- under traditional trust law, a
 4 conflict of interest?
 5 MR. ROHLFING: Only if the trustee's continued
 6 employment is -- is contingent upon your satisfaction.
 7 QUESTION: But if it is, if -- if I say you're a
 8 trustee, I can fire you when I want, then the courts, just
 9 in that -- like Scott on Trusts and so forth, would say
 10 that's a conflict of interest?
 11 MR. ROHLFING: Because you retain too much
 12 control over the -- the disposition of the trust corpus. 
 13 In these voluntary plans, a plan administrator really has
 14 a choice. The plan administrator can elect to retain
 15 control --
 16 QUESTION: No, I understand that. I'm just
 17 trying to figure out what classical trust law would have
 18 been. So you're saying it's the same. It should be
 19 treated the same.
 20 MR. ROHLFING: The more egregious case, Your
 21 Honor, would be the facts of -- that would be similar to
 22 the facts of this case is if the balance of the trust
 23 reverted to the trustee if they didn't spend all the money
 24 on your children's education. That would be an even more
 25 egregious --

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: And then -- then classical trust law,
 2 Scott on Trusts, says that's a conflict of interest and --
 3 and what happens? Then courts review it all if you set up
 4 a trust like that?
 5 MR. ROHLFING: Well, Scott on Trusts, the
 6 Restatement of Trusts, all refer to those decisions as
 7 voidable at the election of the beneficiary, and the court
 8 would review that decision de novo.
 9 QUESTION: Mr. Rohlfing, the -- the petitioner
 10 didn't raise any question about the -- the conflict of
 11 interest. And so we're here on the petition which raises
 12 only the treating physician rule, and as Justice Kennedy
 13 pointed out, you could have the treating physician rule
 14 when you have a separation of the trustee and the -- the
 15 company. 
 So if you could get down to the treating 16 physician rule, I think it would be helpful --
 17 MR. ROHLFING: Yes.
 18 QUESTION: -- since it's the only question
 19 that's raised.
 20 MR. ROHLFING: Yes, Your Honor.
 21 The Ninth Circuit did articulate the Ninth
 22 Circuit rule in the context of conflict of interest. So I
 23 think it's important to keep that focus in mind.
 24 But the treating physician rule that was
 25 articulated by the Ninth Circuit in both this case and in

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 the Nord -- and in the Regula case was not a weighted
 2 rule. There was not a thumb on the scale as petitioner
 3 has put it. Rather the rule that the --
 4 QUESTION: Well, why -- why isn't it a thumb on
 5 the scales when it requires substantial evidence to -- to
 6 rebut? That sounds like a thumb to me.
 7 MR. ROHLFING: It -- it doesn't require
 8 rebuttal, Your Honor. It requires rejection for
 9 substantial reasons.
 10 QUESTION: Well, whatever term you want to use
 11 it, unless you've got substantial evidence to override the
 12 treating physician's opinion, the treating physician's
 13 opinion is supposed to control, and that sounds like a
 14 thumb.
 15 MR. ROHLFING: 
 I think that this Court's 16 jurisprudence and the jurisprudence of other courts in
 17 other contexts have stated that concepts of abuse of
 18 discretion, arbitrary and capricious, and substantial
 19 evidence, are really very similar concepts and there are
 20 very fine, thin lines between those concepts.
 21 For instance, a decision that was made without
 22 the support of substantial evidence, I would submit, would
 23 be an abuse of discretion. If no reasonable person would
 24 conclude, as the plan administrator did conclude, i.e., it
 25 lacked substantial evidentiary support, that would be an

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 abuse of discretion. The court would readily reverse that
 2 type of determination.
 3 And that's exactly what the Ninth Circuit said
 4 in -- in reviewing the record as a whole, as this Court's
 5 jurisprudence in Universal Camera, for instance --
 6 QUESTION: Is it clear that that's what the
 7 Ninth Circuit means by substantial evidence? I mean,
 8 that's what substantial evidence means in administrative
 9 law under the Administrative Procedure Act. It means just
 10 that minimal amount of evidence that's necessary to get a
 11 case to the jury in a -- in a civil trial. But is that
 12 what the Ninth Circuit means by -- or do they mean
 13 substantial evidence? You know what I mean?
 14 (Laughter.)
 15 MR. ROHLFING: 
 Well, unfortunately, the -- the 16 court didn't bold-face or italicize its -- its use of the
 17 term, substantial evidence.
 18 QUESTION: Yes. I'm under the impression that
 19 they mean substantial evidence.
 20 MR. ROHLFING: I think the -- the court in
 21 reviewing a rule 56 motion practice, reviews the decision
 22 of the district court de novo, and it's entitled to
 23 substitute its own judgment. The parties at the district
 24 court agreed --
 25 QUESTION: But rule 56 judgments, summary

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 judgment, that is purely a question of law.
 2 MR. ROHLFING: Correct.
 3 QUESTION: So the -- the fact that it is
 4 reviewed de novo doesn't have much bearing on this sort of
 5 a case, it seems to me.
 6 MR. ROHLFING: Well, the -- once the Ninth
 7 Circuit concluded that the district court had erred in
 8 rejecting the procedural treating physician rule, the need
 9 to articulate specific and legitimate reasons, and had
 10 concluded that Black & Decker operated under a conflict of
 11 interest, and Black & Decker represented to the Ninth
 12 Circuit that it not -- it need not even consider
 13 plaintiff's evidence, the Ninth Circuit exercised its
 14 discretion to reverse and pay the case. And that is a
 15 question that petitioner clearly did not seek cert on. 16 QUESTION: But what about the treating physician
 17 rule itself, which he clearly did seek cert on?
 18 MR. ROHLFING: Yes.
 19 QUESTION: What is your position on that?
 20 MR. ROHLFING: Your Honor, section 1133 of the
 21 -- of the statute and the regulations that were in effect
 22 when Mr. Nord filed his claim required the statement of
 23 specific reasons in order to reject a claim.
 24 QUESTION: This -- we're now talking about an
 25 ERISA claim, not a Social Security claim.

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ROHLFING: An ERISA claim. The statute and
 2 the regulations require a statement of specific reasons. 
 3 And the lower courts have described the statement of
 4 specific reasons as encouraging a meaningful dialogue
 5 between the person claiming benefits and the plan
 6 administrator. And it would seem that a mere statement of
 7 conclusion, we've accepted Dr. Mitri and we've rejected
 8 your physicians, is not a meaningful dialogue. It's
 9 not --
 10 QUESTION: I don't even think they have to say
 11 that. The reasons for rejecting the claim is we're
 12 rejecting the claim because you are not disabled or
 13 because your disability does not -- you know. Isn't that
 14 the reason for rejecting the claim? It isn't a
 15 requirement that they -- that they review the evidence in 16 the case.
 17 MR. ROHLFING: Well, they are required to review
 18 the evidence. That's the petitioner's position.
 19 QUESTION: Yes, but do they have to give a
 20 statement? I mean, you know, the Administrative Procedure
 21 Act requires a -- a statement of -- of reasons for the --
 22 in some detail. But I don't know that this requirement is
 23 anything -- I am rejecting your claim because you filed it
 24 too late. I am rejecting your claim because in my
 25 judgment you are not disabled. Why isn't that an adequate

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 statement of reasons?
 2 MR. ROHLFING: Well, too late would be a -- a
 3 specific reason for rejecting a claim.
 4 QUESTION: Well, but you wouldn't have to review
 5 the evidence of why it's too late. Well, you know, so and
 6 so said he got it then. So and so said you got it earlier
 7 than that. We believe so and so. You didn't have to say
 8 that. You say we're rejecting it because in our view you
 9 filed it late. And it seems to me it's the same thing
 10 with a disability. We're -- we're rejecting it because we
 11 do not -- we do not believe that -- that the disability
 12 you have claimed in fact exists.
 13 MR. ROHLFING: And the problem with -- with that
 14 particular analysis, Your Honor, is that we don't know
 15 whether Black & Decker in this particular case put the 16 same thumb that it's complaining about the Ninth Circuit
 17 put on the scale, that they didn't put the thumb on the
 18 scale for Dr. Mitri. And for all of the reasons that
 19 petitioner and its eight private amici have argued and
 20 also the Solicitor General's office has argued, putting
 21 the thumb on the scale and not weighing evidence evenly
 22 would be just as bad if it was done the other side
 23 silently.
 24 QUESTION: But I don't understand what that has
 25 to do with the question that's -- that's presented to us. 

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Case A, that there's a treating physician who's a longtime
 2 personal physician and his opinion is given to the
 3 administrator. Case B, the employee says, you know, I'm
 4 going to see a back specialist and he goes to a back
 5 specialist who's never seen the man before. Should there
 6 be a difference in those two? I mean, that's -- that's
 7 what you're here to argue.
 8 And -- and Dr. -- was it Dimitri or Mitri?
 9 MR. ROHLFING: Mitri.
 10 QUESTION: Mitri was a specialist in this area. 
 11 The treating physician was not. It -- it seems to me that
 12 it's -- it's perfectly plausible to say that we give the
 13 specialist even greater weight. So what -- the treating
 14 physician rule, it seems to me, quite arbitrary.
 15 MR. ROHLFING: 
 It -- it is arbitrary if it's 16 simply putting weight on the scale. But the Ninth Circuit
 17 cast the treating physician rule as merely a statement of
 18 -- of specific reasons that are legitimate under the
 19 statute and that are supported by substantial evidence in
 20 the evidentiary record before the Court.
 21 But the -- the treating physician rule doesn't
 22 distinguish between -- strike that. I'm sorry. The --
 23 the treating physician rule does distinguish between
 24 physicians that have different levels of probative
 25 evidence. The physician with more information, the long-

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 time treating physician, has a greater source of
 2 information upon which to express an opinion than does the
 3 one-time consultative examiner.
 4 And that's really illustrated in the facts of
 5 this case where Dr. Mitri stated that Mr. Nord should be
 6 able to perform a certain level of work. And his
 7 intentional use of the word should implies that most
 8 people or a substantial number of people with this level
 9 of impairment can engage in this level of activity, in
 10 this case sedentary work interrupted by standing and
 11 walking.
 12 QUESTION: So you are now saying, it seems to
 13 me, the opposite of what you were contending earlier. 
 14 You're saying that substantial evidence means more than
 15 just the amount of evidence that would enable a jury to 16 find a particular fact. Because if that's all that
 17 substantial evidence meant, you wouldn't need a -- a
 18 treating physician rule. That rule would exist for any
 19 physician that the -- that the plaintiff brought in. If
 20 he brought in a non-treating physician and there were no
 21 substantial evidence on the other side in the -- in the
 22 Administrative Procedure Act sense of substantial
 23 evidence --
 24 MR. ROHLFING: Yes.
 25 QUESTION: -- the plaintiff would win. Right?

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ROHLFING: That's correct.
 2 QUESTION: So the treating physician rule is a
 3 -- is a useless rule. You should call it the any
 4 physician rule. If the plaintiff comes in with some
 5 evidence and there's no evidence on the other side, the
 6 plaintiff wins. That's certainly not what the Ninth
 7 Circuit means. And -- and as you were just describing it,
 8 it's not what the Ninth Circuit means.
 9 It means that if you have a treating physician,
 10 you need substantial evidence on the other side before
 11 we're going to -- we're -- we're going to let you overturn
 12 the treating physician's determination. Isn't that really
 13 what's going on here?
 14 MR. ROHLFING: I think the Ninth Circuit did use
 15 the -- the phrase that the opinion of Dr. Mitri was 16 overwhelmed by the other substantial evidence of record.
 17 So you're right.
 18 QUESTION: Well, but -- but that characterizes
 19 it on a very fact-specific basis. It also referred to the
 20 -- is it -- Regula case in which it -- it said there is
 21 the treating physician rule. I think you have to defend
 22 that rule as a rule, if applicable, in the generality of
 23 cases.
 24 MR. ROHLFING: The general application of the
 25 treating physician rule that's reflected in both the --

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 this case and in the Regula case is that the court used
 2 the rule only at the conflict-of-interest level of
 3 inquiry. It didn't instruct -- in Regula, it did not
 4 instruct the lower court to weigh the evidence in any
 5 particular manner. Rather, it instructed the lower court
 6 to allow Delta Air Lines in that case to come forward with
 7 evidence that the conflict of -- conflict of interest did
 8 not infect its decisionmaking process. Again, it allowed
 9 rebuttal evidence of actual bias rather than the pure
 10 conflict of interest that the Ninth Circuit found to
 11 exist.
 12 QUESTION: Well, what is the connection between
 13 the treating physician rule and the concept of actual
 14 bias? The -- the two don't seem to have a lot in common
 15 so far as I can see.
 16 MR. ROHLFING: I think that the courts are
 17 confused below, Your Honor.
 18 QUESTION: Well, I'm confused too.
 19 (Laughter.)
 20 MR. ROHLFING: The courts have created this
 21 hybrid animal that's asking whether conflict of interest
 22 exists and then using actual bias to -- to animate its --
 23 its decisionmaking process. And that's the problem.
 24 QUESTION: I think I can explain the confusion. 
 25 It doesn't make any sense, but I think I can explain it. 

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 The Ninth Circuit is simply saying, look it, any
 2 reasonable person would give the treating physician's
 3 opinion substantial weight over somebody who's not the
 4 treating physician, and if the plan administrator does not
 5 do that, and since he's presumably a reasonable person, he
 6 must biased. Isn't that what's going on? The Ninth
 7 Circuit has simply said, obviously the treating physician
 8 wins in the -- in the usual case. And any plan
 9 administrator who says he doesn't win must be biased.
 10 MR. ROHLFING: I think --
 11 QUESTION: And that's not true in my view.
 12 MR. ROHLFING: I think what the Ninth Circuit is
 13 saying is that when we have expert opinion and all else
 14 being equal, given the fiduciary status of the plan
 15 administrator, that the treating physician should receive 16 .001 percent and tip the scale slightly in favor. It's
 17 the fiduciary status. It's the conflict of interest
 18 analysis that really animates the court's inquiry into --
 19 into this --
 20 QUESTION: So -- so why doesn't this just --
 21 QUESTION: What -- what if you have a -- a
 22 treating physician who presents a paragraph to the plan
 23 administrator saying, you know, I've treated this fellow
 24 for 6 months and I think he's incapacitated? Then you
 25 have an expert, you know, another physician weighs in on

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 the other side and puts in about six or seven paragraphs. 
 2 I put him through some tests, this and that, and I think
 3 he is -- he's not disabled. How does that come out in
 4 your view under the treating physician rule?
 5 MR. ROHLFING: Well, the question then would be
 6 whether the -- the tests that the independent medical
 7 examiner, the one-time examining physician, either
 8 mirrored the test results of the treating physician or
 9 provided an independent clinical basis. And under the
 10 mature treating physician rule, every court has held that
 11 independent clinical findings that are divergent from
 12 those of the treating physician is always a basis for
 13 rejecting the treating physician's opinion.
 14 But that's not the facts of this case. Dr.
 15 Mitri agreed --
 16 QUESTION: Well, does -- does the Ninth Circuit
 17 recognize that the treating physician rule can be rebutted
 18 in that manner?
 19 MR. ROHLFING: Yes, it does.
 20 QUESTION: You say other courts have. Does the
 21 Ninth Circuit?
 22 MR. ROHLFING: In the -- in the treating
 23 physician rule that exists in the Ninth Circuit in a
 24 Social Security context, it is absolutely clear that
 25 independent clinical findings are an independent basis for

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 rejecting the treating physician's opinion.
 2 QUESTION: But it can't be rejected in this
 3 fashion. The treating physician who's a general
 4 practitioner doesn't know anything in particular. Not a
 5 specialist with the brain, he says this man has a brain
 6 embolism. That's all he says. Doesn't say anything else. 
 7 Doesn't give any more details. And somebody -- and -- and
 8 the -- the employer goes to a brain specialist and the
 9 brain specialist says, again, nothing more than this
 10 patient does not have a brain embolism. That would not
 11 suffice in the Ninth Circuit, would it? You would have to
 12 take the opinion of the attending -- of the treating
 13 physician.
 14 MR. ROHLFING: If there's no objective test
 15 result from any physician, an MRI or a CAT-scan? 16 QUESTION: Both of them -- both of them have
 17 come in with conclusory statements. Why shouldn't I
 18 believe the conclusory statement of the expert who
 19 examined the person rather than the -- the general
 20 practitioner? What the Ninth Circuit says is, you have to
 21 believe the -- the treating physician.
 22 MR. ROHLFING: I don't believe that any
 23 reasonable person would accept a -- an intern's -- or a
 24 general practitioner's opinion that the person suffers
 25 from a brain embolism without an objective test showing

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 the existence and presence of that embolism.
 2 QUESTION: Well, then what purpose does the
 3 Ninth Circuit rule say? The Ninth Circuit says the
 4 treating physician is employed to cure and has a greater
 5 opportunity to know and observe the patient as an
 6 individual. I mean, that's -- that's its rule.
 7 MR. ROHLFING: That's -- that's the test.
 8 QUESTION: Well, given the confusion about it,
 9 why isn't it the -- sorry.
 10 QUESTION: And we don't in -- in the law of
 11 evidence -- I'm trying to think of an analogy where we
 12 have some special rule for a particular kind of -- of
 13 person. We have expert testimony generally, but -- but
 14 this is not so confined. I've never seen a rule like
 15 this.
 16 MR. ROHLFING: Well, it really depends on how
 17 you view juries would -- would review divergent expert
 18 witness opinion. If you assume that -- that a jury would
 19 not tend to give a source of evidence more weight than a
 20 evidentiary source that had a less -- lesser pool of
 21 evidence or information, less probative information, then
 22 I think that you're right. But I don't think that that's
 23 what juries do. I think juries look at it in a reasonable
 24 fashion and think an expert with more percipient
 25 information is going to get more weight. And --

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Mr. Rohlfing, why are we getting
 2 juries into it when I thought the genesis of this was the
 3 Ninth Circuit said, in Social Security the courts created
 4 this treating physician rule?
 5 MR. ROHLFING: That's correct.
 6 QUESTION: And the Commissioner liked it so
 7 much, the Commissioner embraced it as her own. And so now
 8 we're going to do the same thing for ERISA.
 9 And that's why when you complicate it with this
 10 bias or conflict, there's no conflict in the Social
 11 Security. And as I read -- that's -- that's a piece of
 12 this decision, but as I understood it, what the Ninth
 13 Circuit was saying, as far as the treating physician rule,
 14 is it was a good idea in Social Security and it's equally
 15 good here.
 16 MR. ROHLFING: That's exactly what the court
 17 decided, Justice Ginsburg. And I think that your analysis
 18 is correct. The court looked at the treating physician
 19 rule and -- and said it -- it creates tools for the courts
 20 to use engaging the reasonableness of administrative
 21 decisions in that context.
 22 QUESTION: But then -- then you started to talk
 23 about juries and in the Social Security context, it's a
 24 guide for the ALJ, not a jury.
 25 MR. ROHLFING: I was speaking more generally

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 with Justice Kennedy. I apologize for bringing in an
 2 inapt analogy.
 3 But I do think that the -- the logic and
 4 fundamental underpinnings of the treating physician rule
 5 engaging any expert witness testimony is that the broader
 6 panoply of information available to, in this case, a
 7 treating physician justifies, all else being equal, all
 8 else -- assuming the same set of objective tests, that the
 9 physician with the greater source of information is
 10 entitled to slightly more weight.
 11 QUESTION: Since the Secretary of Labor doesn't
 12 agree with you, why isn't it better for courts to leave
 13 that kind of a decision to the Secretary of Labor?
 14 MR. ROHLFING: The Solicitor General argues in
 15 -- in its brief that -- the Government's brief, that it 16 has primary jurisdiction to develop the regulations and
 17 flesh out the body of ERISA law. But this Court has long
 18 held that development of the body of Federal common law is
 19 within the jurisdiction of the courts.
 20 QUESTION: Well, I'm -- I'm not suggesting a --
 21 a primary jurisdiction rule. What I'm suggesting is that
 22 the -- the Labor Department is a lot closer to the
 23 situation at the trial level than an appellate court,
 24 including this one. And I -- I simply would have thought
 25 that the -- that the Department of Labor was in a better

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 position just to make a practical assessment of either the
 2 need for the rule or the probable value of the rule than
 3 -- than a court is likely to do. And -- and when that
 4 kind of expert judgment is available, why isn't it simply
 5 sensible for a court in a common law capacity to say,
 6 we're going to leave it to the -- to the party -- to the
 7 -- to the agency that is in a better position to make the
 8 judgment?
 9 MR. ROHLFING: Well, Justice Souter, the -- the
 10 problem with that is that the -- the Secretary of Labor
 11 has not even addressed the conflict of -- of interest
 12 issue and that is the --
 13 QUESTION: But the conflict of interest issue,
 14 you just told us, is not the reason for adopting the rule
 15 here.
 16 MR. ROHLFING: But it is --
 17 QUESTION: It has a -- it is -- it is being
 18 given significance in the conflict issue, but I thought
 19 that was not the reason the rule -- I'm going back to your
 20 answer to your question to Justice Ginsburg. That isn't
 21 the reason the rule was developed in Social Security, and
 22 that wasn't the reason the rule has been adopted here.
 23 MR. ROHLFING: It isn't the reason the rule --
 24 it is the -- the focal point of the rule in the ERISA
 25 context.

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Whose money is at stake in the Social
 2 Security cases?
 3 MR. ROHLFING: Yours and mine.
 4 QUESTION: The Government's money, really. And
 5 if the Government wants to be particularly generous to the
 6 claimant, I guess the Government can be if it wants to
 7 adopt a rule that's very favorable to claimants, which it
 8 has done in the Social Security field.
 9 But it's not the Government's money at stake in
 10 -- in this case and -- and in all of these ERISA cases. 
 11 It's either the trust's money or the employer's money, and
 12 it's supposed to be dispensed according to the agreement
 13 that the parties have entered into. It seems to me it's a
 14 different situation, and I don't think the Government has
 15 as much leeway in deciding to be generous as it -- as it 16 does in the Social Security field. I just don't see --
 17 don't see the parallel between the two at all.
 18 MR. ROHLFING: The parallel between the two
 19 exists on what questions are asked and what answers are
 20 given. The structure is -- is far different. Congress
 21 enacted Social Security as social policy. Black & Decker
 22 adopted its disability plan to attract employees as part
 23 of an employment package. And there -- although it's
 24 Black & Decker's money, it has still promised benefits
 25 under certain circumstances and then has, for -- for

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 reasons that we still aren't -- don't know, concluded that
 2 despite the -- the clear opinions of the treating
 3 physicians and the ambiguous opinion of the independent
 4 medical examiner, concluded that Mr. Nord did not sustain
 5 his burden of proof, and despite the clear evidence from
 6 the human resources specialist that Mr. Nord could not
 7 perform his usual and customary work --
 8 QUESTION: Why was it so clear? First of all,
 9 if you take the treating physician -- was given an
 10 opportunity to comment on the expert's opinion, on Dr.
 11 Mitri's opinion. Here it is. Not one word from either
 12 the treating physician or the -- what is it? The
 13 orthopedist who was -- who was called in by the treating
 14 physician. So the expert stands out there all alone with
 15 no comment on it.
 16 And then as far as the human resources person is
 17 concerned, it was Mr. Nord's counsel, was it not, that
 18 wrote up that evaluation for her to answer yes or no,
 19 right?
 20 MR. ROHLFING: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. I wrote
 21 those interrogatories because I read Dr. Mitri's opinion
 22 when he said Mr. Nord could only lift 15 pounds, and I
 23 looked at the human resources specialist's statement of
 24 bona fide occupational job qualifications that the
 25 occupation required lifting 20 pounds and a number of

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 other factors, including the recognition of Dr. Mitri that
 2 Mr. Nord suffered from a significant pain syndrome. I
 3 believed that -- that Ms. Forward would answer those
 4 questions all in the negative, that no, Mr. Nord could not
 5 perform his usual and customary occupation. She didn't
 6 answer the questions all in that manner. But she did
 7 answer the last question in the negative, that Mr. Nord
 8 could not perform the work of a material planner with the
 9 pain that he was enduring.
 10 QUESTION: Well, I think -- I think if you gave
 11 anybody that question, somebody is in terrible pain, can
 12 they relate to others -- it's not as though this was some
 13 kind of a neutral evaluation form. It was a loaded
 14 question that you asked her.
 15 MR. ROHLFING: 
 Well, the -- the question wasn't 16 framed, though, as terrible pain. It was occasional
 17 moderate pain, Your Honor.
 18 QUESTION: Let's find the question. Where is
 19 it?
 20 MR. ROHLFING: The question appears in the
 21 record. 
 22 MR. PATERSON: It's at L36-L37.
 23 MR. ROHLFING: Thank you, Mr. Paterson.
 24 L36 and 37. The -- the sixth question that was
 25 asked of Ms. Forward --

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: 36 and 37 of?
 2 MR. ROHLFING: Yes, in the large petition
 3 lodging. I can read the question in full.
 4 Dr. Mitri describes Kenneth Nord as suffering
 5 from degenerative disc disease and a chronic myofascial
 6 pain syndrome. You have indicated in your employer's
 7 statement provided to Metropolitan that the work of a
 8 material planner requires continuous interpersonal
 9 relationships and frequent exposure to stressful job
 10 situations. Assume that Kenneth Nord would have a
 11 moderate pain that would interfere with his ability to
 12 perform intense interpersonal communications or to act
 13 appropriately under stress occasionally, up to one-third
 14 during the day. Could an individual of those limitations
 15 perform the work of a material planner?
 16 And the answer marked is no. And Ms. Forward
 17 signed that.
 18 QUESTION: As I understand that question, it --
 19 it asks him assuming he can't do his job for one-third of
 20 the day, can he do his job? What -- what answer would you
 21 expect? I mean, if -- if you just said assuming he had
 22 moderate pain, could he do his job, then -- then your
 23 answer would mean something, but you asked, assuming he
 24 has moderate pain that prevents him from doing his job a
 25 third of the day.

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ROHLFING: Significantly interferes.
 2 QUESTION: Yes, all right.
 3 MR. ROHLFING: Well --
 4 QUESTION: I mean, I'd give the same answer. 
 5 You -- it seems to me you -- you had a hypothesis that
 6 doesn't help your case.
 7 MR. ROHLFING: In -- in asking a -- a question
 8 of a vocational expert or a human resources specialist,
 9 assuming the person suffers from moderate pain, could they
 10 perform their job, then we've left it up to the witness to
 11 answer the question, what does moderate mean? And so what
 12 I did was define moderate.
 13 QUESTION: But you didn't ask moderate. You
 14 didn't ask just moderate pain. You said, moderate pain
 15 that would interfere with his ability to perform intense 16 interpersonal communications.
 17 MR. ROHLFING: But not preclude.
 18 QUESTION: So it wasn't moderate pain in the
 19 abstract. It was moderate pain in a quite concrete
 20 context that would -- moderate pain that would interfere
 21 with his ability to do his job.
 22 MR. ROHLFING: Yes, Justice Ginsburg -- in my
 23 experience if you don't define the terms of art in -- in
 24 questions to vocational specialists, you're not going to
 25 get the answers that are helpful.

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: You didn't -- you didn't leave it
 2 available for her to say, I don't think that moderate pain
 3 would interfere with his ability to conduct interpersonal
 4 relationships. That was not available for her to say.
 5 MR. ROHLFING: That was certainly available to
 6 Black & Decker to solicit that type of information. She
 7 was -- she was a Kwikset employee, a wholly owned
 8 subsidiary of Black & Decker Corporation. They didn't ask
 9 -10 QUESTION: Well, we're not examining their
 11 evidence. We're examining yours. The issue is what does
 12 your evidence prove. It doesn't seem to me it proves
 13 much.
 14 QUESTION: Perhaps you could address why your --
 15 the -- the treating physician didn't comment at all on the 16 experts.
 17 MR. ROHLFING: The treating physicians didn't
 18 comment on the -- the opinions of Dr. Mitri because I
 19 didn't ask them to. I read Dr. Mitri's report as
 20 supporting the proposition of disability. His lifting
 21 limitations were less than the lifting required of the
 22 job. The standing and walking that he needed was not
 23 permitted in the facial job description. And I made a --
 24 and I actually argued affirmatively to the Ninth Circuit
 25 that Dr. Mitri's opinion, properly read in the context of

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 the -- the employer's statement that Ms. Forward had
 2 filled out before at the request of Metropolitan, actually
 3 supported the proposition of disability rather than
 4 supporting the proposition of no disability that had been
 5 advocated.
 6 And I would hasten to point out that this plan
 7 does not contain an accommodation clause. It doesn't say
 8 if you can perform your job with accommodation, then
 9 you're not disabled. It doesn't say that. And if we're
 10 going to use contract analysis in -- in determining the
 11 effect of the plan language on the ultimate issue of
 12 disability, the failure to include accommodation as an
 13 affirmative prong of the -- the inquiry in the issue of
 14 disability is fatal to Black & Decker's case because the
 15 only reason that Ms. Forward's answers to the first four 16 questions could be supported is if Black & Decker
 17 accommodated it.
 18 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Rohlfing.
 19 Mr. Paterson, you have 3 minutes remaining.
 20 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEE T. PATERSON
 21 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 22 MR. PATERSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
 23 The Ninth Circuit's treating physician rule is a
 24 categorical rule based upon the assumption that a treating
 25 physician's opinion is superior to other medical opinions

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 in the record. In the Regula case, at page 1139, the
 2 Ninth Circuit got to the issue of -- of the treating
 3 physician rule prior to the time it even began to discuss
 4 the conflict of interest. And it held the treating
 5 physician rule requires deference, as it applies under
 6 ERISA, and that the treating -- the plan administrator in
 7 the Ninth Circuit must defer unless there are -- he has
 8 good enough reasons not to defer.
 9 The court then later on in its opinion addressed
 10 the issue of conflict of interest.
 11 This Court in -- last year in Ragsdale v.
 12 Wolverine when -- stated that categorical generalizations
 13 failed to hold true that the justification for the
 14 categorical rule disappears. In the facts of this case,
 15 that categorical justification disappears both in the 16 individual facts of the case and as a general proposition
 17 for all other cases.
 18 In the facts of this case, respondent went to
 19 Dr. Hartman, his internist, with back problems. Dr.
 20 Hartman referred him to two specialists, Dr. Zandpour and
 21 Dr. Ali, both of whom examined him, tested him, and
 22 diagnosed his condition. Both Dr. Ali and Dr. Zandpour,
 23 based upon the tests they conducted, provided a diagnosis
 24 of mild degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine.
 25 The employers sent the respondent to another

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 specialist, Dr. Mitri, a neurologist, who agreed with the
 2 opinions of Dr. Zandpour and Dr. Ali, but also looked at
 3 the job duties of respondent. Dr. Mitri opined that he
 4 could perform the duties of a material planner if he was
 5 allowed to stand up and walk periodically.
 6 Just focusing on these four physicians'
 7 opinions, it's clear that the opinions with the most
 8 weight are the three specialists, Dr. Zandpour, Dr. Ali,
 9 and Dr. Mitri, not the treating physician, Dr. Hartman. 
 10 However, the Ninth Circuit's rule requires the plan
 11 administrator to give deference, special weight, and a
 12 presumption in favor of Dr. Hartman's opinion even though
 13 he referred respondent to specialists for evaluation and
 14 even though he has no apparent expertise in back injuries
 15 or back pain.
 16 In the facts of this case, the categorical
 17 generalization is not true.
 18 In addition, the amicus, American Medical
 19 Association, has brought before this Court its statistics
 20 published in its own publication, the Journal of the
 21 American Medical Association. Those statistics state that
 22 39 percent of treating physicians misrepresent symptoms,
 23 diagnosis, and severity of illness when their patients
 24 submit insurance claims. There's no justification for a
 25 categorical rule that treating physicians' opinions are

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 entitled to special weight, deference, and a presumption
 2 in ERISA disability benefit determinations when the
 3 professional organization of the treating physicians
 4 admits that treating physicians often make
 5 misrepresentations when their patients are filing
 6 insurance claims.
 7 There's no support for a categorical rule that
 8 treating physicians' opinions are more reliable than other
 9 medical opinions either in the facts of this case or in
 10 the -- the ERISA context in general. In every case, the
 11 ERISA plan administrator should weigh not only the source
 12 of the opinion, but also the experience, the testing, the
 13 treatment, and the credentials of the -- of the physician.
 14 We respectfully submit that this Court should
 15 reject the Ninth Circuit's treating physician rule and 16 remand this case back to the Ninth Circuit.
 17 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.
 18 Paterson.
 19 The case is submitted.
 20 (Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the
 21 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
