    "speech": "Historically it does. It's been the policy of the State of North Carolina for almost a century, as I referenced the lien statutes that apply generally to -- to tort actions, to civil recoveries, to protect the providers of medical services, in those cases date back to 1935."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "Can I ask you a somewhat technical -- and I appreciate your paying attention because it's hard for me to keep all this in my mind. All right. It's my understanding of North Carolina, everyone accepts the rule and North Carolina agrees that if you in -- in North Carolina advance to the victim $50,000 in medical expenses -- now, you're never going to get more than that back and you don't want more than that back. Now, the victim and the tortfeasor enter into a settlement and you have a rule and the rule is you will never get more than 50,000 or 33 percent, whichever is less. That's the rule, whichever is less. So if the settlement is for $100,000, you are not going to take more than 33, so you have advanced 50. Okay. So you have basically three situations. The first situation is where a judge has said -- you know what, I find that only $10,000 of this settlement is for medical expenses. In that case you take $10,000, no more. Is that right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MADDREY",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",

And the second is the situation where they stipulate that only 10 percent is for medical, and the third situation is this situation, namely there is no stipulation and there is no judicial finding. So my thought, which is wrong I guess, is if the judge says it's 10 percent you won't take more than 10 percent, but if in fact it's a stipulation of 10 percent North Carolina courts have not yet decided that, and this is a case where there is no stipulation and no judicial finding. Now you're telling me I have that wrong. So you explain what the North Carolina is on that because I think it makes quite a difference."

So I thought that one way to figure it -- I will just be repeating myself. One way to figure it is how much of this $100,000 settlement is attributable to medical expenses as a judge would say. Now, you're telling me there is a case in North Carolina which says if the judge himself says that 10 percent of the settlement is for medical, that's not what California -- that doesn't matter according to North Carolina law, and I'd like the name of the case, the State case that says that."

As to the anti-lien provision of the Medicaid Act, if the statute defines the amount of medicals as 230 -- excuse me -- two-thirds, that would present the same analysis under the anti-lien provision of the Medicaid Act. The difference would be whether the State could show a rational basis in its -- in its tort law, in its jurisprudence."

But I thought you told me that the one-third really doesn't have anything to do with an estimate of how much is medical and how much is not medical. So it seems that you would have the same basis to say two-thirds as you do to say one-third. Am I wrong about that?"

  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Why? I don't understand that. You see, I think the only way you can defend it is that -- is that the recipient never -- never had a property right. Once -- once recovery is given to the recipient, the recovery does not belong to the recipient. And if that's true for 33 percent, it can be through -- true for 100 percent. Has there ever been any litigation since 1935 about takings problems, with -- with the State requiring 33 percent to go to the medical provider, even though it may well be that -- that less or more of that amount went to medical damages --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "-- can I go back for a second? Because I want to show you where I got my perhaps mistaken idea from. There is a case called Andrews. And there is a statement in Andrews, which is a South -- North Carolina case -- which says in certain circumstances, although the statute says just what Justice Scalia says, the lawyer sits there, he takes one-third and pays it to the State. Then this case has this sentence in it: \"Ahlborn controls when there has been a prior determination or stipulation as to the medical expense portion of a plaintiff's settlement. In those cases, the State may not receive reimbursement in excess of the portion so designated.\" Now, having read that sentence, I thought the law of North Carolina was that this statute does not apply, and that when, in fact, the jury or the judge finds that only 10 percent was for medical expenses, the State cannot take more than 10 percent. And the same is true of a stipulation. That's what those words seem to say to me. Now you're telling me I'm not reading those words correctly, that the case of Andrews does not affect our case here, and that you -- that the law of North Carolina is that you get one-third. Now, what is it? Do you see why I am confused?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MADDREY",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. I will try -- try, if I can, to explain what I believe to be the source of the confusion is. The stipulation in Ahlborn referenced in the Andrews decision was between the Medicaid recipient and the State of Arkansas, the lienholder. It came in the Federal court action to challenge Arkansas's imposition of its lien."

I think his argument is well-grounded, given the language of the statute, but that illustrates the very problem here, that this statute takes one-third of a settlement or judgment regardless of the true facts of the case. And that is problematic under Ahlborn. Justice Kagan, you had asked Mr. -- General Maddrey about the basis for the North Carolina statute. General Maddrey had referred to it being a rule of thumb of three times medicals. But if you actually turn to the Fourth Circuit's decision, which is based on the briefs that were filed in the Fourth Circuit, in the petition at page 20A, the rule of thumb is actually three times specials, which of course is different than three times medicals because special damages would include things like lost wages and various other things."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Mr. Browning, let me give you a different rationale for this statute. It's different from the one the State suggests, but it would go something like this: There is an allocation that has to be made. In making allocations there are two ways of doing it. We can do it case-by-case, individualized decisionmaking; or we can use some bright-line rules. And the advantage of bright-line rules is that they are cheap and efficient and sometimes they are not more inaccurate than individualized decisionmaking because in individualized decisionmaking you can maker errors, too. So this is a reasonable way to make an allocation decision. And nothing that we said in Ahlborn suggests that a State needs to use case-by-case decisionmaking rather than bright-line rules to make the allocation that it needs to make between medical and nonmedical damages. What about that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BROWNING",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I would turn to the language of the Ahlborn decision which makes clear that States cannot lay claim to more than a portion of a settlement or judgment that represents payment for medical care or medical expenses. When you have --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Yes, but that doesn't answer the question. I mean that portion, according to North Carolina, is one-third."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BROWNING",
    "speech": "It is the State saying it is one-third even though there is no basis and even though you have cases like this where it's clearly not one-third --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Yes, but what the State says is the law. I mean, the State says one-third is for medical."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BROWNING",
    "speech": "Your Honor, if that is all North Carolina had to do, of course, the Ahlborn decision would have been dramatically different if Arkansas had simply enacted a cap of 100 percent or 50 percent or 40 percent because, in the Ahlborn decision, the State of Arkansas was only seeking to recover 39 percent of the tort settlement. And under North Carolina's theory, if Arkansas had simply been bright enough to implement a cap, the Ahlborn decision would have been completely different. And that makes absolutely no sense. I think the Ahlborn decision indicates that there has to be a process in order to fairly and appropriately determine the amount that the State may --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "So you need, ultimately you need an adjudication. You have to leave it either to a jury to decide what percentage of the total award is -- is medical expenses or have a separate proceeding. Let's say where there has been a settlement, you need a separate proceeding to decide how much of it is really for medical. You know, they may say 10 percent is, but who believes that? You -- you need a proceeding. That is awfully time-consuming. And -- and as Justice Kagan suggests, I'm not sure it's going to be very accurate. I don't think a jury determination is going to be -- is going to be accurate on that score. And I don't know how you go about determining how much of a settlement is attributable to -- to medical expenses versus other things, especially when the settlement itself says only 10 percent is medical expenses."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BROWNING",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Scalia, I think it is very easy for States to follow that and to put in practices or procedures that result in appropriate allocation of medical expenses."

    "speaker": "SCALIA",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BROWNING",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "How does it work? Because I would imagine at the negotiation you have the -- the victim's lawyer and the tortfeasor's lawyer and the tortfeasor's lawyer is interested that the bottom line number be as low as possible and the victim's number, that it be as high as possible. And the victim's lawyer, in fact, would like as little as possible to be allocated to a source which is going to take that money away from him. So they can reach agreement. What they will do is say 1 penny is for medical expenses and everything else is for pain and suffering, and that's very good for the victim. And it's irrelevant to the tortfeasor. So -- so when you see that on a piece of paper, what is it you are going to do? What kind of proceeding are you going to have? And it's a proceeding about a proceeding. It's a proceeding about the settlement negotiation. What's it going to look like? What does it look like in the 16 States? We will have a plaintiff's lawyer testify. He will say, Your Honor, I really wanted 1 penny and only 1 penny to be allocated to pain and -- to medical expense. And the defendant's lawyer, he's being very honest, he'll say, I didn't care; if that's what he wants, that's fine with me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, but it's worse than that. He does care because the smaller amount means that the victim is going to actually get to keep more and that's all the victim's lawyer is concerned about, and that's fine with the tortfeasor's lawyer because otherwise he would have to pay more."

And they come in and they recover a million dollars, right? So what's appropriate in that case? The other side will say, well, we settled on a million dollars, pain and suffering was really 20 million and we came down to a million. So what's fair allocation in the case of the medical expenses?

Basically, you have to make an estimate of what the damages would have been if the case had been tried and then you determine that the medical portion of the damages would have been 15 percent and so you reduce, then you take the amount of the settlement, and the amount of the settlement that is attributable to the medical expenses is 15 percent.

And so we're going to have that as an absolute rule so that we don't have to go through these proceedings every time just to make sure that it's 30 percent rather than 33 percent.

So yes, I do see potential problems with that. Obviously, it would be different than the scenario that we have here, but it does -- the starting point has to be the anti-lien provision, which is no lien may be imposed. This Court in Ahlborn assumed without deciding that there would be an implied exception to that statute. But that -- that exception is very limited.

So, in a situation, such as yours, where the total recovery is -- is not going to suffice to cover both pain and suffering and medical expenses, it'd be very intelligent to do what Justice Alito proposed. And that seems to me a real, I don't know, gaming -- gaming of the system."

Often, there will be no shared intent. What -- what the States are doing is determining what the appropriate allocation should be. And the States that have individualized determinations, which is what we think is required here, have developed a number of different procedures for doing that. For instance, a district court in Pennsylvania, in McKinney --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Excuse me. I have a -- I have a theoretical problem right at the outset. I mean, what the statute forbids is asserting a lien on recovery that is for medical expenses. And you're telling me that the States aren't even trying to find out what portion of the recovery was for medical expenses. They're looking to determine what proportion should have been for medical expenses. How does that tie in with the -- with the prohibition of the lien?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ANDERS",
    "speech": "Well, I think this Court established in Ahlborn that the beneficiary and the State, they respectively have interests in the settlement that arises from the fact that in the tort case the plaintiff has asserted claims for medical damages and for nonmedical damages. And so Ahlborn establishes that we need to divide the two in order to determine what the State may recover. Ahlborn also establishes that the beneficiary has an interest in the settlement that arises from her nonmedical claims that can be allocated away by an allocation method, such as one that gives -- that says that 100 percent of the settlement must always be allocated to -- to medical damages."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "So -- so you're saying that the State can, in making this determination, in fact take away from a plaintiff who has recovered a -- a greater amount in medical expenses, or a lesser amount in medical expenses, can take -- take away that by determining how much should have been allocated to medical expenses, right?"
  },

    "speaker": "ANDERS",
    "speech": "The State does have some discretion to determine what the appropriate allocation is --"

    "speech": "So you're messing up the lien law anyway, no matter which way you play it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ANDERS",
    "speech": "Well, I think Ahlborn establishes that we have to make some kind of division of the settlement, and when the parties haven't done it, there's no jury determination. We don't know ahead of time before the allocation has been done what precisely the amount the medical damages should be. But we do know because the plaintiff, the beneficiary, has asserted nonmedical claims and she has compromised them, we do know that she has an interest in the settlement that arises from her nonmedical claims. So for instance, you can imagine the situation in which a plaintiff has a claim -- a claim that is 10 percent medical damages and 90 percent lost -- past lost wages. So they're both equally concrete. In that situation, when the plaintiff settles for pennies on the dollar, I think we -- we would have serious questions about whether a one-third allocation to medical damages in that case would be appropriate. But without an individualized determination, there would be no way to know whether this is a case in which the -- the blanket rule that the State has is actually overestimating the amount that should be appropriately allocated to medical damages."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ANDERS",
    "speech": "Certainly. So for instance, in McKinney v. Philadelphia Housing Authority, this is a district court case in Pennsylvania, what the court did was it said, we have the settlement; we know how much the past medical damages were because we know what the medical bills were; and we can -- we can assume that the jury, had this case gone to trial, would have awarded 100 percent of the medical damages because they were provable and because there weren't disputes about -- about that. And so the court then said, I'm going to then apply a discount rate for the uncertainty that the defendant would have been held liable at all."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "What if -- what if the other -- the parties I guess are coming in and saying, well, that's not how juries work. They don't care that this measure of damages is particularly calculable. They come to a general view. You've got medical expenses, you've got pain and suffering. They make a judgment about that. Would that be a good argument to make?"
  },

    "speaker": "ANDERS",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "So how would it take it into account? You said, well, because the medical expenses are readily calculable, we assume that that's what the jury meant first, and then the other stuff is extra so the State can get it. But maybe sometimes they just come to a -- a total figure and they don't care how it's allocated. You say, well, that's an argument they can make. Well, what's a judge supposed to do in a particular case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ANDERS",
    "speech": "Well, I -- this is positing a situation in which there's been a settlement rather than a jury determination.  So I think that the -- the court that's doing the allocating has some discretion here. And so one thing it can do is say I'm going to essentially prioritize medical damages because I think juries usually will award them. But a State could also provide that the inquiry should be more equitable and open-ended. So, for instance, Illinois and Missouri have provided simply that -- that the court shall make an equitable allocation. It can take into account the fact that the -- that the plaintiff may receive a double recovery."

If the North Carolina law says 30 percent is the cap, but in a particular case you can show that that's not a fair allocation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ANDERS",
    "speech": "That's absolutely right. And -- and to return to one of Justice Kagan's earlier questions, I think a one-third allocation may be in the mine run of cases a reasonable presumption. But there will be some cases, like my 90 percent, 10 percent example, where it isn't a reasonable allocation."

    "speaker": "KAGAN",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ANDERS",
    "speech": "I think in those States, it's just a right for the beneficiary to try to rebut the presumption. Some of those States start with a rebuttable presumption of full reimbursement. So that the presumption starts at the full amount that the State paid."

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

You're saying yes, you can try to recover recovery from third-party tortfeasors, but if you do that you've got to set up this apparatus where everybody can come in and you've got to prove what the allocation was and all that. So -- I mean some -- 34 States haven't done that, right?"
  },

    "speech": "Well, yes, for your purposes. But I'm interested in -- in my purposes. And I'm trying to figure out whether or not that's a significant financial burden on the State -- if they're going to go about trying to recover this money, that they've got to provide some apparatus, administrative, judicial, whatever, to make a calculation that I still don't understand what it's addressed to. And -- and not only that, but even if you do know what it's addressed to, you just take into account all these things and come up with an equitable."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ANDERS",
    "speech": "I don't think that these States have found that it's a significant administrative burden. One reason is that once the allocation rules are in place, it's our understanding that most of these cases settle. The beneficiary and the State agree as to what the allocation is, so this doesn't go to a hearing in the first place. But even -- even when there are hearings, I think States can take significant measures to lessen the burden. For instance --"

There are 10 others that have an irrebuttable presumption, we think, of full reimbursement.

They think their one-third rule is a good way of measuring that. You think that the one-third rule as a rebuttable presumption is a better way of measuring that. Now normally, or often, I would see government arguments like that where they'd say, and, by the way, we're interpreting very technical language in our statute, and Chevron and/or Skidmore means that you should give us particular weight. Is that part of your argument here, and if it isn't, why isn't it?"

    "speaker": "ANDERS",

    "speech": "We have heard a lot about what a State could or maybe should do, but what must a State do under the Medicaid Act to fulfill its obligations? The Fourth Circuit and respondents and apparently the United States say they have to have a post-settlement trial, I guess a trial to settle the settlement. And that, while an available option, is not a mandatory requirement under anything that I can see in the Medicaid Act."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KAGAN",
    "speech": "Well, General, how about this, and I am having a little bit of trouble here because I think a State could come in, or I think there is a reasonable argument that a State could come in and say -- you know, we've made an estimate, and here's our best estimate, and we don't think there is a need for an individualized decision-making on top of that. But as I understand your argument, that is not what you are saying. You are making a very different kind of argument, suggesting that you can peg this number any place, no matter what the relationship between the number and the actual allocation that cases -- that allocation of medical and nonmedical damages in the real world. So if that's the case, what do I do?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MADDREY",
    "speech": "Your Honor, the statute -- North Carolina's statute defines the amount that must be included for the repayment by the Medicaid recipient. It's not guessing after the fact, but instead providing in advance, the recipe as to how to put the settlement together. It tells the parties what they have to do. And that makes it a bright-line rule, which I think you need to compare to the alternative, which is this -- this, what the Fourth Circuit called a true value hearing after the fact, after the settlement, how did -- how did they get there? Is it what they did or what they should have done or what they could have done? In this case you've got a $42 million damage claim settled for 2.8 million --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "So how do -- what do we do with the Federal statute that says, You are not entitled to a lien of any amount that is greater than your medical expenses? And using the Solicitor General's Office example, everybody knows that the true value of medical expenses in a particular case was only 10 percent, you are still getting 30 percent. How do we -- how do we honor the terms of the Federal statute?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MADDREY",
    "speech": "Because the State statute says the State never recovers more than its actual medical expenses. If in that hypothetical the medical expenses were 100,000 or 10 percent, the North Carolina statute would say North Carolina gets up to one-third of the settlement but never more than they paid. So by definition it can't be for something that was not medicals. And that's the bright-line rule that the North Carolina statute creates."
