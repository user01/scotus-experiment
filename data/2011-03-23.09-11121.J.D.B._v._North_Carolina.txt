1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:14 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument next in Case 09-11121, J.D.B. v. North 5 Carolina. 6 Ms. Blackman. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA S. BLACKMAN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MS. BLACKMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 J.D.B. was only 13 years old when he was 12 taken out of his middle school classroom and escorted to 13 a closed door interrogation conducted by outside law 14 enforcement regarding a matter that did not take place 15 on school property. He was isolated from his family who 16 had already demonstrated an interest in this 17 investigation and sought to shield him from the police. 18 He was not advised that he was free to leave or free not 19 to answer questions until he had already incriminated 20 himself. 21 The restrictions on J.D.B.'s freedom of 22 movement which existed because of his youth were 23 heightened by the manner in which this officer chose to 24 conduct this interrogation and the expected deference to 25 authority figures categorically characteristic of

1 children were taken advantage of by the manner in which 2 this officer chose to conduct the interrogation. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Blackman, I'm -- I'm -4 I'm not clear on what you are proposing. Is there to be 5 one different Miranda requirement rule for all minors, 6 or is there to be one for, what, 20-year-olds, 7 19-year-olds, 18-year-olds, 17, 16? This one is 13, do 8 we calibrate it that finely - 9 MS. BLACKMAN: Justice - 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- or do we just say, you 11 know, what would a minor -- I don't know, a general 12 minor regard as restrictions upon his departure? 13 MS. BLACKMAN: Justice Scalia, what we are 14 proposing is that the test be a court may consider age 15 in determining whether a reasonable person in the 16 juvenile - 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. 18 MS. BLACKMAN: So we are not - 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you mean 15, 14, 13, 20 13 1/2? Right? 21 MS. BLACKMAN: We did not suggest that it be 22 calibrated by age, although in State court jurisdictions 23 many of them are and are not finding that a difficult 24 test to perform. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not -- if not

1 calibrated by age, how is it to be calibrated? 2 MS. BLACKMAN: It is to be the exercise of 3 reasonable judgment by the judge taking into account 4 common sense - 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Common sense? 6 MS. BLACKMAN: -- community experience is 7 one. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and -- and how - 9 how is the law enforcement officer going into the 10 confrontation going to know whether a judge is going to 11 be applying a 15-year-old rule, a 13-year-old rule, or 12 whatever? 13 MS. BLACKMAN: Clearly in the jurisdiction 14 in which he practices he should be aware of the fact 15 that a court utilizes that type of - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that's clear? 17 MS. BLACKMAN: But we're not suggesting that 18 that be done. What a court is examining is - 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't this all 20 subsumed under the voluntariness rule? 21 MS. BLACKMAN: As this Court has frequently 22 recognized, the voluntariness inquiry is more difficult 23 for courts to perform than the Miranda custody one. And 24 you have also recognized that the court - 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, at least it's the
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 court performing it, not the interrogating officer, as 2 Justice Scalia's questions point out. 3 MS. BLACKMAN: The police officer plays a 4 role in the voluntariness, also. And the police officer 5 must be assessing whether the circumstances may be 6 giving rise to an involuntary confession. Age - 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about mental 8 deficiency, if -- if age should be one of the factors, 9 deciding whether the individual regarded himself as in 10 custody or not, why shouldn't mental deficiency be so as 11 well? Is there any -- any basis in principle for not -12 I mean, once you do this, don't you, in effect, say that 13 it is a subjective inquiry whether the particular 14 individual regarded him or herself as being in custody; 15 isn't that the -- the basis of what you're arguing? 16 MS. BLACKMAN: No. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: No? Why is age different 18 from mental deficiency, for example? 19 MS. BLACKMAN: Age is different because, 20 number one, it involves restrictions on freedom of 21 movement, so the circumstances of the interrogation are 22 going to be understood and interpreted differently by a 23 child than it would be by an adult. 24 Secondly, we're talking about cognitive 25 differences which exist between children and adults

1 which affects their perception and understanding. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: You could say both of those 3 things about the mentally deficient. They may regard 4 themselves as -- as unfree to leave, and they have 5 cognitive deficiencies. 6 MS. BLACKMAN: As far as I know, there 7 hasn't been the recognition in the law that there is, as 8 to children, that proves such as the mentally 9 handicapped are unable to - 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about this test 11 which comes from three cases, the first being Berkemer, 12 the second Stansbury, and the third I'll tell you in a 13 second? It is that those -- what are -- in considering 14 a reasonable person for this purpose and avoiding 15 subjective states of mind, you would look at objective 16 circumstances, known to both the officer and the suspect 17 that are likely relevant to the way a person would 18 understand his situation. All right? 19 So both would be both mental illness and age 20 and -- I don't know, whether you speak English, and a 21 lot of other things would be relevant, provided they are 22 things that are relevant to how a person would 23 understand his situation and are known to both the 24 officer and the individual. 25 The third case, of course, is my dissent in

1 Alvarez. 2 (Laughter.) 3 JUSTICE BREYER: But nothing in the majority 4 conflicts with that, that I can see, except the holding. 5 I thought I lost the case, but apparently it's up again, 6 so I don't see why that isn't a perfectly good test. 7 But if you're not going to support it, then I've got no 8 support. 9 MS. BLACKMAN: Well, we're simply making the 10 point that there's not necessarily going to be a 11 floodgate opening. And we haven't seen that - 12 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but I mean what 13 Justice Scalia was really asking is, do you favor 14 something like this test that I read, which is open as 15 to circumstance? Anything could fit in that blank, as 16 long as both policemen and the -- and the individual 17 know it and it is relevant as to how he understands the 18 circumstance, whether he's likely free to go or not. 19 MS. BLACKMAN: Conceptually absolutely. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you. Yes, that's 21 right. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even -- even if you said 23 no, you're pushing us there, because there's no basis 24 for treating a childhood any differently from these 25 other factors. So basically you're saying Justice

1 Breyer would call it objective circumstances. You know, 2 whether you're mentally deficient, I would call that the 3 subjective condition of the -- of the person being held 4 in custody. And I think, I don't think that's what we 5 meant by the phrase "objective circumstances." 6 But you want objective circumstances to 7 include the character of the person being held in 8 custody, whether he's mentally deficient, whether he's 9 schizophrenic, known to the police, you know, whatever 10 factors, right? Those are all objective circumstances? 11 MS. BLACKMAN: Your Honor, what we are 12 talking about are a complex of characteristics which are 13 unique to children, and that's what we are examining in 14 this case. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blackman, what is 16 complex about a juvenile investigator? That's what this 17 police officer was. So he's investigating a juvenile 18 for juvenile justice purposes, and I think there's 19 hardly anything more objective than that. This case has 20 child written all over it. It's investigator who deals 21 with children. The first proceedings is going to be a 22 juvenile proceeding. 23 How can you not take that into account, 24 whatever -- whatever these other factors may involve? 25 But here it seems to me so rampant because this police
9

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 officer dealt only with juveniles, and he investigated 2 juveniles. 3 MS. BLACKMAN: I agree completely. This 4 officer was assigned the case because it had already 5 been determined that a juvenile was involved. This is 6 the population that he deals with on a daily basis. He 7 certainly has a basis on which to assess how J.D.B.'s 8 youth was factoring into this interrogation. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And then is it your point 10 that he has to do something more than the read the 11 standard Miranda warning? Suppose he read the standard 12 Miranda warning? End of case as far as you're 13 concerned? 14 MS. BLACKMAN: Obviously his age would 15 factor into whether there was a valid waiver. But, yes, 16 he has got to Mirandize or otherwise J.D.B. - 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but doesn't it 18 follow from there that we have to have a -- we have to 19 change the warning? 20 MS. BLACKMAN: Not necessarily. I mean, 21 some children will not understand Miranda warnings, just 22 as some adults don't understand Miranda warnings. But 23 children are nonetheless -- have to be given the 24 opportunity to be told of their rights, so that they can 25 at least have the opportunity to make an informed

1 decision. 2 JUSTICE ALITO: Are you asking trial judges 3 to make -- to do something that is realistic? Do you 4 think -- let's take a hypothetical trial judge who, 5 let's say, is 60 years old and has an IQ of -- that's at 6 least an average IQ. And now you're asking this trial 7 judge to decide whether under particular circumstances, 8 let's say, a 14-year-old with an IQ of 85 would 9 appreciate under particular circumstances that he or she 10 was free to leave? 11 MS. BLACKMAN: Your Honor - 12 JUSTICE ALITO: You think a trial judge can 13 really do that? 14 MS. BLACKMAN: State courts have been 15 performing this analysis now for several decades, and 16 they haven't indicated that they have difficulty doing 17 so. And to the extent that your - 18 JUSTICE ALITO: They must have greater 19 imaginative powers then. 20 MS. BLACKMAN: What? 21 JUSTICE ALITO: They must have greater 22 imaginative powers than I think I would have under those 23 circumstances. 24 MS. BLACKMAN: Part of your question - 25 JUSTICE ALITO: When you take a particular
11

1 set of circumstances, and the judge would say, if I were 2 13, I would not understand that I could go. However, if 3 I were 15, I would understand I could go. 4 MS. BLACKMAN: Your Honor - 5 JUSTICE ALITO: Can you slice it like that? 6 MS. BLACKMAN: What we are talking about 7 here is relative youngness and relative oldness. I 8 mean, the empirical data demonstrates to us that the 9 older a child is to an adult, the more adult-like they 10 are. The younger, the farther away they are from that 11 adult standard - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: We need empirical data for 13 that? 14 MS. BLACKMAN: Excuse me? 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: We need empirical data for 16 that? 17 MS. BLACKMAN: Empirical data does exist. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: To show that - 19 MS. BLACKMAN: I'm simply pointing that out. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the closer to adulthood 21 a child is, the more like an adult he is? 22 (Laughter.) 23 MS. BLACKMAN: I'm simply pointing out that 24 the empirical data supports that. There are bases of 25 knowledge from which -

1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do we need either 2 imaginative powers or empirical data to know that when a 3 13-year-old is brought into a room in his school, taken 4 out of class, four people are there, two are police 5 officers, one is assistant principal, threatened with 6 custody, that that person is not going to feel free to 7 take off and leave? 8 MS. BLACKMAN: We do not. I'm simply 9 pointing out that there is a basis of knowledge from 10 which courts as well as police officers can make the 11 required assessment. It is so clear in this case, 12 however - 13 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, sympathetic cases can 14 make bad law. So take the same set of facts and let's 15 hypothesize that this is a 15-year-old. Would the 16 15-year-old appreciate that he could go? Or make him 17 16. Or make him a street-wise 17-year-old. 18 MS. BLACKMAN: A judge should be able to 19 consider that, and under the clear circumstances of this 20 case, it is unlikely that a - 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: When the policeman sees 22 him, he's dressed in baggy jeans, you know, down around 23 his thighs, and when the judge sees him he's wearing a 24 Buster Brown jumper suit. You don't really think that 25 it's going to be equivalent?

1 MS. BLACKMAN: I'm not sure I understood the 2 question. 3 (Laughter.) 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The whole point - 5 MS. BLACKMAN: Yes. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The whole point of 7 the Miranda rule, I thought, was to provide clear, 8 objective guidelines about what the police are supposed 9 to do. And it seems to me that one of the difficulties 10 with your rule, however clear it may seem in this case, 11 but it does have to apply more broadly, is that that's 12 off the table, and now they're not only going to have to 13 know, does this person understand it, but they're going 14 to have to know, it's not every one of these situations 15 that's going to be in school. They're going to have to 16 guess how old the person is. 17 And there are differences. Some 18 15-year-olds know a lot more than some 17-year-olds, and 19 so on. And -- and the facts that you're concerned about 20 all go into the voluntariness inquiry, which is still 21 pertinent after Miranda. Why don't we just put those 22 facts into that inquiry and say, look, we've got one 23 strict rule; everybody knows it, you hear it on TV all 24 the time, people are given Miranda warnings; that part 25 of it is done?

1 MS. BLACKMAN: It doesn't change the rule 2 itself. I mean, the rule itself remains: All objective 3 circumstances relevant to the custody determination must 4 be considered. 5 What it's doing is taking this out of the 6 reasonable adult standard, which by default is the only 7 one, then, that can be used, and so it's not going to be 8 muddying the waters in the sense that it is something 9 needed in order to promote accurate fact-finding. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it be -- is it 11 enough if the officers in this situation said, look, 12 you're free to leave, you know, whenever you want, 13 but -- and then goes on -- or do they have to think - 14 now, maybe -- maybe a 13-year-old really doesn't think 15 that's true, or maybe a 13-year-old really doesn't feel 16 that he can leave if he's got the vice principal there 17 and they want to talk. 18 MS. BLACKMAN: I mean, that is an objective 19 circumstance that occurs in the course of an 20 interrogation which is very weighty in determining if 21 custody occurs. Here - 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm thinking it 23 would not even be enough if they told the 13-year-old, 24 look, you can leave, but I want to ask you some 25 questions. And the principal is there, and he thinks,
15

1 well, you know -- maybe the 13-year-old is thinking, 2 maybe I'm going to get in trouble if I leave. 3 MS. BLACKMAN: It involves all of the 4 circumstances which are arising during the course of 5 these interrogations, but certainly advising someone 6 that they are free to leave and advising them that they 7 are free not to answer questions is almost half of the 8 Miranda warning, and it is giving the child - 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if the parent tells 10 them not to leave? What if the parent says, you go and 11 talk to this police officer? If you did something 12 wrong, I want them to know about it; talk to the 13 officer. 14 MS. BLACKMAN: Whether that would factor in 15 depends, I think, upon whether they're acting as an 16 agent of the police, because what we're looking at is - 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no. They're not an 18 agent; they're acting as a parent. 19 MS. BLACKMAN: Oh. What we're examining is 20 whether we've got a police-dominated environment and 21 coercion in the situation and circumstances under which 22 the child evaluates the - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you answering my 24 question? 25 MS. BLACKMAN: No, I'm not. Obviously, the
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 specific factors that occur in the course of any 2 interrogation will be considered, but our focus here is 3 upon what the police officer must do. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would be one relevant 5 factor that would be considered was that nobody called 6 the parents? 7 MS. BLACKMAN: It is relevant in this 8 situation, because -- by North Carolina law. Because a 9 custodial interrogation was occurring, there was a 10 requirement that a parent or guardian be present. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that relevant 12 to the Miranda inquiry? It might be relevant to the 13 voluntariness inquiry, but I don't see whether you call 14 the parents or not. Part of his Miranda -- your Miranda 15 right is not to have your parents called. 16 MS. BLACKMAN: What I understood the 17 question was: Was it relevant that a parent was not 18 contacted? In this particular situation, yes, because 19 that was going to create an independent basis on which 20 the statement wasn't going to be admitted, and is than 21 additional reason why - 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Independent of what? 23 MS. BLACKMAN: Independent of Miranda. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, right. That's 25 my whole point.
17
Alderson Reporting Company

1 MS. BLACKMAN: But that is an additional 2 reason why police officers need to be aware of what the 3 age is of a child that they are interrogating because of 4 independent obligations arising out of State statutes. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is your answer to 6 Justice Ginsburg that, no, the fact that a parent was 7 not notified is not relevant to the Miranda question? 8 It may be relevant to the voluntariness question. 9 MS. BLACKMAN: No, I believe it remains 10 relevant to the Miranda question, because - 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The question really is if 12 he is in custody. And maybe there's something different 13 about being in the room with a juvenile police 14 investigator and the assistant principal and being in 15 that same room with your parents there. 16 MS. BLACKMAN: That is correct. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, so it's not just 18 that they have to call the parent; they have to wait for 19 the parent to show up? 20 MS. BLACKMAN: Because of State statutory 21 requirements, here they were. Obviously, not every 22 State has that kind of requirement. In this particular 23 situation, there was a requirement of parental presence. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not -- that's 25 not pertinent to the Federal law question on the Miranda

1 warnings. 2 MS. BLACKMAN: I understand that, but I'm 3 just explaining that independent bases may arise for 4 which an officer has to be aware of the age. And given 5 that, we're not imposing additional burdens. These are 6 things that police officers have to be considering. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the age of the 8 person being questioned is unclear? 9 MS. BLACKMAN: If the interrogation is 10 occurring under circumstances where the officer should 11 have known, then I think the burden remains with the 12 officer to consider this, and that could arise from - 13 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose -- suppose the 14 person shows an ID and it shows the person is 19 years 15 old, and the officer looks at him and says, he looks 16 like a pretty young 19-year-old? 17 MS. BLACKMAN: If there is no way to verify 18 the information that the child is giving, then the 19 officer accepts the ID as being the age of the person he 20 is interrogating. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: What if -- I mean, under my 22 example, what if the child -- what if the person looks 23 like a minor but has an adult ID? 24 MS. BLACKMAN: I think that if - 25 JUSTICE ALITO: Does the officer have an
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 obligation to look behind that? 2 MS. BLACKMAN: Um - 3 JUSTICE ALITO: Or the other way around? 4 The person says, I'm 15, and the officer sees that this 5 person has a pretty heavy beard and - 6 MS. BLACKMAN: The officer has to proceed on 7 the basis of his observations. I mean, objective 8 circumstances are things that are readily apparent. 9 There can be circumstances which tell the officer that, 10 in fact, he is dealing with a child, either the setting, 11 the appearance, the contact of parents, and so on. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there a good faith - 13 MS. BLACKMAN: But if there -- if there is 14 no reasonable basis upon which the officer could discern 15 that this is a child, if he has no reason to know, then 16 the rule that we are asking to be put into effect would 17 not apply. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does a good faith mistake 19 make it okay? If, you know, the officer, in good faith, 20 believes that it's not a minor and -- and proceeds 21 accordingly? 22 MS. BLACKMAN: Yes. I mean, what we would 23 be assessing is: Are the circumstances clear such that 24 the officer should have known? And if they simply could 25 not ascertain it, then the rule that we're asking for
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 would not apply. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The way you phrase the 3 question, you say, may the trial -- whether trial courts 4 may consider the juvenile's age in Miranda to make the 5 in-custody Miranda determination. 6 Did you really mean "may," so it's 7 discretionary with each judge, whether a juvenile's age 8 is relevant to the in-custody analysis? 9 MS. BLACKMAN: No, it is must. As with any 10 objective circumstance, the court has to take it into 11 account, and we can't be relegating some to a 12 discretionary review and others to mandatory review. 13 So, yes, if a child is involved in the case, then a 14 court must take that into account - 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So - 16 MS. BLACKMAN: -- in determining if there's 17 custody. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- are you saying, going 19 back to the hypotheticals that some of my colleagues 20 posed, police officer comes across an individual, looks 21 older or looks younger, doesn't know, and just engages 22 that person and says come over here and let's talk for a 23 second. Is the officer required to ask the age? 24 MS. BLACKMAN: It's a simple enough matter, 25 but no. But I think if the person -

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if they're not 2 required - 3 MS. BLACKMAN: -- as a Terry stop, where 4 Miranda is not coming into play at all - 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Perhaps not, but it's - 6 if it's outside a school, school corner. No reasonable 7 suspicion, just says come over here, kid. Is he 8 supposed to ask the age to see if he's 19 or 18 or 17? 9 MS. BLACKMAN: We're not in a custodial 10 interrogation setting, I think in your question, and so 11 Miranda is not coming into play at all, but I mean, this 12 is a matter - 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It is, because it's a 14 stop with no reasonable suspicion. And the kid comes 15 over, and the officer stands him there and continues to 16 talk to him for half an hour. 17 MS. BLACKMAN: If there is a custodial -- if 18 we have restraint on freedom of movement which is rising 19 to the degree of a formal arrest, it's a simple enough 20 matter to ask. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why don't we go back 22 to the test that Justice Breyer suggested, which would 23 answer many of the hypotheticals here, that the 24 objective fact is what is known to both? 25 MS. BLACKMAN: What is known to both.

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That way you don't get 2 into what the 13-year-old is thinking inside himself or 3 not, because that then becomes subjective; you don't go 4 back to what others might think are special 5 characteristics or subjective characteristics. You go 6 to what's known, what's an objective factor known to 7 both. 8 MS. BLACKMAN: Yes. But I think that we 9 can't be encouraging willful blindness, either; and so, 10 you know, if an officer encounters someone at a facility 11 where only children would be, for example, like an 12 elementary school or a juvenile detention facility - 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think that's clear, 14 but that's different. I mean, you can tell the 15 difference between a 9-year-old, I think, and an adult 16 generally. 17 MS. BLACKMAN: Indeed. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And I'm hard pressed to 19 think that anyone would believe that if you took a 20 9-year-old out of his classroom and the assistant 21 principal walked him into a room and said these guys 22 want to talk to you, that that 9-year-old would think 23 he's free to leave. 24 MS. BLACKMAN: I agree. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right. So objectively

1 that's a fact known to everyone, that it's a 9-year-old. 2 MS. BLACKMAN: Correct. Correct. I did - 3 there have been a lot of questions that sort of 4 presupposed that we are doing a subjective inquiry, and 5 I think nothing could be farther from the case. What we 6 are not doing - 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess part of my problem 8 is it's just in some respects hard to put the Miranda in 9 the context of a -- let's say a 13-year-old alone. It 10 may be that Miranda warnings, "You have a right to 11 remain silent, anything you say can be used against you" 12 -- might terrify the kid just to hear about it. I'm 13 just wondering how the Miranda warning works here 14 anyway. The school is in loco parentis, it has certain 15 -- it has obligations and privileges with respect to the 16 student. 17 MS. BLACKMAN: Well, Miranda is the only 18 procedure to date that anyone uses, and constitutionally 19 they are -- everyone is entitled to some advisement so 20 that they can make an informed choice. I mean, whether 21 there should be a more simplified or different Miranda 22 warning for children is an issue for another day, but we 23 can't simply say we're not going to do anything. We are 24 not going to tell these children that they don't have to 25 cooperate with the State in building a case against

Is it your argument that age is the 4 only objective individual characteristic of the person 5 being questioned that must be taken into account, or are 6 there other objective characteristics of people being 7 questioned who -- that fall into the same category? 8 MS. BLACKMAN: I think that one's status as 9 an inmate, for example, can be characterized as 10 objective, and certainly that has been taken into 11 account because inmates share that same baseline 12 restriction on freedom of movement that children do, and 13 so this court in -- Shafter -- for example, 14 characterized it as what would the reasonable person in 15 the inmate's position have understood as to his freedom 16 of movement. So, yes, I mean, there can be other 17 objective circumstances individual to the person, but 18 we're still not answering a subjective - 19 JUSTICE ALITO: But what are they? I don't 20 want to use up your rebuttal time, but what -- what are 21 they in addition to age? For people who are not 22 institutionalized or in school or in an environment like 23 that? What falls into the same category as age? 24 MS. BLACKMAN: I think that's for other 25 litigants to press upon this Court upon proper records

COOPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 13 please the Court: 14 In determining custody for Miranda purposes, 15 this Court has considered only the external surrounding 16 circumstances of the question and not the attributes 17 that affect the mental processes of the person being 18 questioned. Age fundamentally changes the reasonable 19 person test, makes it complex, makes it more illogical, 20 with no logical stopping point for adding other 21 characteristics, as Justice Breyer - 22 JUSTICE BREYER: You would add none?

Then why aren't you 6 willing to take into account an ambiguous situation as 7 was true in Alvarado, a tough situation where it's 8 pretty unclear; he was brought there by his parents and 9 there are all these things around that might suggest to 10 a 20-year-old, yeah, you could leave, but to a 11 12-year-old, "no." If the judge can take into account 12 whether he's in a wheelchair, whether he just speaks 13 Ukrainian, whether in fact a thing -- you have to swim 14 through a pool and he doesn't know how to swim -- I 15 mean, all kinds of things like that; why can't he take 16 into account in a proper situation before he thinks he's 17 in custody or not, things they both know including 18 whether he's 8 years old or 22? 19 MR. COOPER: Your Honor, because those are 20 obvious circumstances that everyone agrees - 21 JUSTICE BREYER: And it's obvious whether 22 he's 8-year-old or 2 2, too. I'll tell you that. 23 MR.

And you have to 2 think like a Ukrainian speaker or think like a -- a -- a 3 -- like a person who knows he's in a wheelchair before 4 you know he can't get up those steep steps. 5 MR. COOPER: I think the difference - 6 JUSTICE BREYER: What is exactly the -- the 7 difference? 8 MR. COOPER: The difference is with the 9 Ukrainian is that you look at whether the knowledge was 10 actually acquired. And if he speaks Ukrainian, then 11 everyone knows that the -- that the knowledge was not 12 acquired. People understand that someone who has a 13 seeing eye dog, if you take him out of the room, then 14 you have exerted coercion over the situation. I think 15 that's different from requiring the officer to get into 16 the mind of the reasonable 15-year-old or 16-year-old. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: I haven't said that. What 18 the opinion said, which unfortunately may mean nothing 19 unless it's promoted to the status of majority, is you 20 look to those factors that are relevant to, known to 21 both policeman and the suspect, and are known to be 22 relevant to the likelihood that a person -- a likely 23 person, not him -- that are known likely relevant to an 24 ordinary person's belief -- this kind of a person - 25 that he thinks he's free to go.

Mentally 14 challenged people, seniors in rest homes, there are all 15 kinds of people who would be more compliant, but 16 compliance doesn't necessarily equal coercion. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: You know the sentence I'm 18 referring to in my dissent, presumably?

This is a middle -- middle 17 school. This is an officer who deals only with 18 children. I can't imagine any setting where age isn't 19 more apparent than when dealing with an assistant 20 principal, a juvenile investigator, going -- deciding - 21 the juvenile investigator deciding the place where he 22 wants to conduct this is in a middle school. I mean, 23 just as a matter of common sense, how can you say that 24 we're going to have the same test for this 8-year-old as 25 we would for the 30-year-old?

1 MR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, the officer 2 may not know the age, but if he does, in this situation 3 he did, and -- and if the officer is in a middle school, 4 there is still a problem with having to figure out what 5 his actions and how they -- what they are and how they 6 affect a juvenile of a particular age. 7 In the situation of the 8-year-old it may 8 seem intuitively wrong, but the issue is, is you have to 9 get into the mind of the 8-year-old, makes it very 10 difficult as a practical matter. The officer's going to 11 have voluntariness problems. If the officer would read 12 Miranda, the officer is going to have waiver problems. 13 Officers have, in those situations, 14 incentive to read Miranda, to get a parent. In -- in - 15 in this type of situation the officer went there, it - 16 it was a familiar location to this juvenile, it was a 17 situation where he knew three of the people in the room, 18 the officer asked him if he wanted to answer questions, 19 and he said yes, the interview was relatively short. 20 The juvenile left at the end of the 21 interview, which is -- which is relevant, and I think in 22 this situation if -- if you -- if you look at it 23 broadly, it's very difficult for officers to tell age 24 and to tell how age affects the situation. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: He probably couldn't leave

COOPER: Your Honor, he probably could 4 not. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the -- the additional 6 coercive effect of not being able to leave probably 7 didn't make a whole lot of difference. He knew he was 8 stuck where his parents had put him, in the school. And 9 if the school sent him to a classroom, he had to be in 10 the classroom; and if the school sent him to a place 11 where he could, if he wished, voluntarily speak to the 12 police officers, he had to be there. 13 MR. COOPER: Well, I think that's right, 14 Your Honor. I think you look at the school setting and 15 I think you look at - 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And we look at what is 17 the normal school setting just like we looked at the 18 normal business settings, he's in class, all the 19 children are around him. This seventh grader was 20 marched by the school security officer, taken away from 21 his peers, from his class in -- put in a room with a 22 closed door with the assistant principal. That is not a 23 normal part of the school day. That's not where he is 24 required to be. This is - 25 MR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, I think

If you have someone who is very 18 young, but if you have someone without any other kind of 19 disability, the voluntariness test is there.

1 the entire purpose of Miranda and its requirement 2 because there was a belief that it wasn't -- that 3 voluntariness wasn't enough -- was not good enough 4 because it was such a high bar, to secure the privilege 5 against self-incrimination? 6 MR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, I agree with 7 that, but the voluntariness test was complex because you 8 did consider so many factors. So the Court lifted the 9 Miranda test out of the voluntariness test, made it an 10 objective test, a prophylactic one, clearly a different 11 test - 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That doesn't answer my 13 question. If we've said if you're not in custody, it's 14 going to be nearly impossible for you to show that your 15 statement was involuntary, are you now accepting that 16 with respect to age a 9-year-old may not feel free to 17 leave as opposed to a 13 or 14-year-old, that somehow we 18 should instruct the courts that age really needs to be 19 stepped up in the voluntariness test? 20 MR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, in -- in 21 voluntariness, you don't necessarily have to have 22 custody to prove that a statement is involuntary, and of 23 children who are particularly young, that will come into 24 play significantly. I think you don't have to get into 25 turning Miranda upside down in order -

COOPER: Justice Sotomayor, I think it 6 is already a significant factor in the voluntariness 7 test, and I think particularly for young children, I 8 think you're going to see that continue to occur. 9 JUSTICE KAGAN: General Cooper, I'm not sure 10 how I understand or that I understand how this would be 11 turning Miranda upside down. Miranda is already an 12 incredibly complicated test about when those warnings 13 need to be given, all right. So there are all manner of 14 circumstances which go into the determination of whether 15 a person would feel free to learn -- leave, whether a 16 person would feel as though he were in custody, a 17 thousand things, how many people are in the room, how 18 long the interrogation is, where the interrogation is, 19 the particular circumstances of the interrogation. 20 So, this is not a bright line test, and all 21 that we would be doing here would be adding an 22 additional objective factor to an already multifaceted 23 inquiry. 24 MR.

1 a combination of factors, but it's informed with 45 2 years of case law. And officers now have a pretty good 3 idea as to what combination of factors constitute 4 custody for Miranda purposes. 5 What age does is now we're going to have to 6 go back in and reassess all of those combination of 7 factors through the eyes of a 13, 14, 15-year-old, 8 16-year-old, it's going to be case law that's going to 9 take - 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why is that? We've 11 seen two cases that seem like blue moon, once in a blue 12 moon. Alvarado is a odd set of circumstances.

What terrible thing happens? 17 MR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor - 18 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the answer to that 19 question? 20 MR. COOPER: You over Mirandize.

1 Now -- now -- now, why is that a burden on the criminal 2 justice system that sometimes in ambiguous circumstances 3 or because this kid is very young, he might not 4 understand it quite as well, and the officer sees that, 5 the kid sees it, and so the officer has to give him a 6 Miranda warning. 7 MR. COOPER: Your Honor - 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what happens to 9 destroy the criminal justice system? You can see from 10 my overstatement, I tend to suspect nothing, but you 11 tell me. 12 MR.

1 dealing with a seventh-grader, why should it be 2 different for in custody for Miranda purposes? 3 MR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, I think when 4 you're dealing with voluntariness, when you're dealing 5 with consent to search, when you're dealing with waiver, 6 you're looking at the particular juvenile. You're 7 looking at all of the circumstances. The courts have 8 said that the Miranda test is different - 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought all the police 10 officer was looking at when he said "I have to get a 11 warrant" is that he's dealing with a seventh-grader, not 12 all the circumstances. Very simple: Age. 13 MR. COOPER: Well, it might - 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He's under the age of 15 consent. 16 MR. COOPER: It might have been, in this 17 circumstance, that he didn't own the house.

COOPER: And, Your Honor, you are right. 23 There are other categorical prohibitions on age across 24 the board in our law, but here what we're doing is 25 asking officers to assess each situation based on the

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 particular age of a juvenile, which makes it all the 2 more difficult for the officer. 3 You know, say for example that you're at a 4 Terry stop and there are a number of juvenile-looking 5 people there. Let's say they're 15 to 19, but the 6 officer doesn't know it. He's at the Terry stop. He's 7 going to be faced with, potentially, Mirandizing some of 8 the people there and not -- not others. That's going to 9 put law enforcement in an untenable situation and make 10 it very complex for them as to when they read Miranda 11 and they don't.

You are trying to understand this situation as 5 the blind person would have seen it or as the deaf 6 person would have seen it or as the 13-year-old would 7 have seen it, and I don't understand why it's different. 8 MR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, I think it's 9 different because it has to do with something that is 10 obvious. It is not necessarily obvious how a 13- or 11 14-year-old would view the situation. And just in 12 the -- the Alvarado opinion, the opinion says that 13 sometimes the permissible objective facts and 14 impermissible subjective opinions sometimes merge. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: The blind person doesn't 16 have a different mind. 17 MR. COOPER: That's correct. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: The deaf person doesn't 19 have a different mind. He just has less data, and it's 20 easy to take account of less data; easier to take 21 account of less data than it is to take account of how 22 different one's mind is because he's 16 instead of 13 or 23 whatever. That's the difference between the blind and 24 the deaf, isn't it? 25 MR. COOPER: I think you're absolutely -
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 absolutely right, and yes, too, Your Honor. I think 2 it's important to know that we have already started 3 going down the slippery slope in a number of states. 4 There have been 11 states, contrary to Petitioner's 5 brief, that are considering other characteristics in 6 Miranda, such as sophistication, such as education, such 7 as intelligence. That makes it so much more difficult. 8 And this Court has not hesitated -- it did 9 not hesitate in Alvarado; it did not hesitate in 10 Berkemer -- to correct lower courts, to say we've got to 11 make sure that Miranda is complete, that Miranda stays 12 clear and objective, and that we don't blur the lines. 13 JUSTICE ALITO: If the law goes down that 14 route, then one of the chief advantages of the Miranda 15 rule, which is that it's a relatively simple objective 16 test, is eliminated, and the law of Miranda begins to 17 resemble the law of voluntariness. And maybe at that 18 point, there is no longer a strong argument in favor of 19 Miranda, and the voluntariness test will be the sole 20 test. 21 MR. COOPER: We support Miranda, Your Honor. 22 We support Miranda in its current form. We think it's 23 appropriate, but I think clearly, by adding age into the 24 circumstance, it makes it more complicated. 25 Your Honor, I would -- Justices, I would

1 voluntariness test that already takes age into account, 2 and second of all, are given under circumstances that 3 don't otherwise meet the definition of custody; that is, 4 formal arrest or its functional equivalent. 5 I think that's a relatively small and not a 6 particularly problematic category of statements, and I 7 don't think it's worth complicating the Miranda rule in 8 order to make sure that those statements are suppressed. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Maybe you can explain 10 this to me, too. 11 You have a blind person there. Everyone - 12 you don't know how blind. He's somewhat blind. A deaf 13 person. How hard of hearing? We're not sure. So the 14 policeman goes a little overboard. You are free to 15 leave, or shows it to him, or makes sure he gets it in. 16 Okay? Why is that so tough to do where you also have a 17 12-year-old?

FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I don't think 12 you're doing the same thing, and I think it's easier to 13 put yourself in the mindset of a person with a sensory 14 deprivation than a person of a particular age, and let 15 me explain why. 16 For a person with a sensory deprivation, 17 like in Justice Breyer's example, the sign that someone 18 can't read, I think it's very common and easy for 19 officers and courts to figure out how they would react 20 to the situation if the sign simply weren't there. 21 With age, what you're asking perhaps a 22 45-year-old officer to do, in Justice Alito's example, 23 or a 60-year-old judge to do, is to put them into the 24 frame of mind of a person that they haven't been for 32 25 years or 45 years, and I don't think that's a very easy

1 inquiry to ask officers or courts to make. 2 I think this is really going to complicate 3 the Miranda rule by asking them, A, to do that, and, B, 4 because there are going to be many cases, unlike this 5 case, where it's not going to be apparent to the officer 6 what age the suspect is. 7 One thing that comes up fairly commonly in 8 many jurisdictions is that an officer will stop someone 9 on a -- do a traffic stop of someone on the road; the 10 person will claim not to have their ID, and it will turn 11 out the person is 14 and they will give the name and 12 birth date of an older sibling. And there is simply no 13 way for an officer in those circumstances to know what 14 the age of the suspect is. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Limit it to when the age 16 is known. If we limit it to, this is an officer who not 17 only knows he's dealing with a seventh-grader but he 18 decides the venue for the questioning is going to be a 19 room in the school, that's -- it's not a mystery. It's 20 not a guess. He knows he's dealing with a 21 seventh-grader. He sets it up. 22 Are we to ignore what the investigating 23 officer knows? The investigating officer knows he's 24 dealing with a child. 25 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think there
47

1 are sort of two parts to your question. Let me deal 2 first with the rule that would only apply when officers 3 know the identity, know the age of the suspect. I think 4 that rule would be easier to apply than the rule the 5 Petitioners are suggesting and would mitigate some of 6 the damage, but first of all it doesn't solve the 7 critical problem of asking officers who aren't 8 themselves 13 to think like someone who is 13; and 9 second of all, I think for reasons that I think were 10 apparent during the argument by my friend on the other 11 side, that rule might easily devolve into a "should have 12 known" test, and officers simply aren't going to be able 13 to deal with that. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: The officer doesn't have to 15 think like a 13-year-old, he has to think the way a 16 60-year-old judge would think a 13-year-old thought, 17 right? 18 (Laughter.) 19 MR. FEIGIN: That's right, Your Honor, and 20 it may depend what -- which particular 60-year-old 21 judge - 22 JUSTICE BREYER: But that isn't -- to me, 23 anyway, that is not the question. I don't think anybody 24 is asking anybody to think like anything else. All it 25 is, when you face a younger child, and he is free to go,

1 and you mean he's free to go, you just sort of err a 2 little bit on the safe side and make sure he understands 3 it. That's all. Nobody has to think like anybody. All 4 they have to think is let's err somewhat on the safe 5 side. Now why is that tough? 6 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think that 7 the main problem here is that it's going to create more 8 confusion for officers because it's another factor they 9 have to put into the test, and it's - 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What's the - 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't we require 12 Miranda always? 13 MR. FEIGIN: The courts - 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any harm in 15 requiring it always? It's always easy to do. Why don't 16 we require it all the time? Can you tell us why it 17 makes a difference? 18 MR. FEIGIN: I think it's very unrealistic 19 that every time an officer opens their mouth they have 20 to give Miranda warnings, and I think it would 21 fundamentally change the nature of police interactions 22 with the public. The Court -- and the other reason the 23 Court has never required it is that voluntary 24 statements, the Court made clear in two cases last term 25 again, Maryland v. Jasper, and Berkeley v.

FEIGIN: And there's no reason to - 5 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry. 6 MR. FEIGIN: Please. 7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that a 00 a 8 person with Down's syndrome, that that should be taken 9 into account in this inquiry? 10 MR. FEIGIN: I'm not sure how that would be 11 taken into account, Your Honor. To the extent that 12 someone with Down's syndrome thinks differently from 13 someone who doesn't have Down's syndrome, I think that 14 would be very relevant to the voluntariness test but 15 would not be relevant to the custody test. Because it's 16 -- again it's going to be very difficult to ask an 17 officer to put themselves in the mindset of someone who 18 has Down's syndrome. I think the -- the third 19 problem - 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how is that different 21 than blindness or hearing? A person with Down's 22 syndrome, many -- some don't -- show characteristics 23 that they're not capable of comprehension, or not 24 capable of absorbing information. 25 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor -

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They barely look at you, 2 they barely -- you know, there are characteristics that 3 show you a lack of absorption of information. 4 MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, I may have 5 difficulty dealing with this particular hypothetical 6 because of my lack of knowledge of the particular 7 symptoms of Down's syndrome; but if you're dealing with 8 a suspect who simply can't absorb information about the 9 world, then that's going to be a sensory deprivation 10 that's going to be taken into account, because it's 11 going to subtract circumstances away that that suspect 12 can't perceive. But if you're asking about the mindset 13 of someone that has a particular sensory disability, 14 then no, I don't think that would be taken into account 15 because it's asking too much of officers to try to put 16 themselves in that mindset. 17 And the third problem, I think, with 18 factoring age into the custody test is that -- and as I 19 think Petitioners effectively conceded, it creates a 20 slippery slope problem. There really isn't a clear 21 distinction between age and other things such as mental 22 disorders or cultural background, that defendants also 23 argue change whether they believe that they've been 24 subject to a formal arrest or its functional equivalent. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't want Miranda

1 warnings to be given where they are unnecessary because 2 they are only necessary to prevent coercion, and where 3 there's no coercion, we want confessions, don't we? And 4 the Miranda warnings deter confessions. 5 MR. FEIGIN: That's right, Your Honor. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that the basic 7 reason? 8 MR. FEIGIN: That's right, Your Honor, 9 and - 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's not cost-free to 11 require Miranda warnings. 12 MR. FEIGIN: That's right - 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a good thing to have 14 the bad guys confess that they're bad guys, right? 15 MR. FEIGIN: That's right, Your Honor, 16 that's what I was trying to say earlier. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you -- you are so 18 quick to answer that's right, isn't it so that the 19 manual that this very officer was given to use said 20 before you question a child, give Miranda warnings? 21 MR. FEIGIN: Yes, it did, Your Honor. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Apparently the people who 23 train these juvenile officers think it's a good thing, 24 not a bad thing to give a Miranda warning. 25 MR. FEIGIN: Well, one reason they may think
52

1 it's a good thing and one reason I think the Court 2 doesn't need to accept Petitioner's rule here, is that 3 officers often will give Miranda warnings, for precisely 4 the reasons Justice Sotomayor was suggesting earlier, 5 which is that when officers do give Miranda warnings, 6 it's going to be -- and those Miranda -- the Miranda 7 procedures are all validly followed, there's not going 8 to be a real robust voluntariness inquiry because in 9 most cases where the Miranda procedures are followed, 10 the statements are going to be found to be voluntary 11 under the voluntariness test. 12 And if I could actually add answer an answer 13 to Justice Scalia's earlier question, Miranda isn't 14 simply concerned with coercion. The Court made very 15 clear in Oregon v. Mathiason that Miranda isn't 16 attempting capture every quote, unquote, "coercive 17 environment." What Miranda is directed at is a specific 18 environment -- thank you. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your 20 sentence. 21 MR. FEIGIN: Specific environment, namely 22 custody, which is defined as a formal arrest or its 23 functional equivalent.

1 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA S. BLACKMAN 2 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 3 MS. BLACKMAN: I think what's very odd in 4 this case is that the only party that didn't consider 5 J.D.B.'s age was the courts. I mean, it was clearly 6 being taken into account by Officer DiCostanzo, and 7 J.D.B. was fully aware of his own age. And under 8 Thompson v. Keohane, what a reviewing court is supposed 9 to be doing is immersing itself in the actual 10 circumstances of the case; and without this 11 consideration of age, then the courts are examining 12 hypothetical, because -- hypothetical interrogations and 13 not the one that was actually occurring in the case. 14 Officers have to make judgments about every 15 objective circumstance that arises, and asking them to 16 make objective determinations on juvenile status is no 17 different and is not going to muddy the water. I think 18 as Justice Kagan pointed out, custody is a very 19 difficult issue. It's not subject to bright line rules. 20 But we can't be defining it in such a way where we are 21 requiring these children to be someone that they never 22 could be, and that is, reasonable adults. 23 If our goal here is to ensure reliability of 24 factfinding, reliability of statements, if we want to 25 reduce the coercion, to which our citizens are entitled,
