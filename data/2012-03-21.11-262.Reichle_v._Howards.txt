3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:31 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in Case 11-262, Reichle v. Howards. 5 Mr. Gallagher. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN R. GALLAGHER 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 8 MR. GALLAGHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 9 it please the Court: 10 The issue before the Court today is whether 11 Secret Service agents who are prepared to take a bullet 12 for the Vice President must also be prepared to take a 13 retaliatory arrest lawsuit, even when they have probable 14 cause to make an arrest. Respondent in this case seeks 15 personal money damages against two U.S. Secret Service 16 agents who arrested him, allegedly with a retaliatory 17 motive, after he lied to them about whether he touched 18 Vice President Cheney. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There's just a little bit 20 of noise in the courtroom, and I'm -- I have a little 21 bit of difficulty hearing your very opening statement. 22 MR. GALLAGHER: Sure. 23 The Respondent in this case seeks personal 24 money damages against three -- against two -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Yes.

4 1 MR. GALLAGHER: -- U.S. Secret Service 2 agents who arrested him, allegedly with a retaliatory 3 motive, after he lied to them about whether he touched 4 Vice President Cheney. There are three reasons why 5 these agents should not be held personally liable. 6 First, the absence of probable cause should 7 be a required element of a retaliatory arrest claim. 8 Thus, this Court is called upon to answer the question 9 that it left open in Hartman v. Moore. 10 Second, U.S. Secret Service agents acting in 11 their protective capacity should be entitled to a 12 qualified immunity when they make an arrest with 13 probable cause. Indeed, to view it any other way would 14 be to subject Secret Service agents to the potential of 15 retaliatory arrest claims based upon a mere allegation 16 of retaliatory animus, something this Court has 17 steadfastly refused to do, and for good reason: Because 18 retaliatory animus is easy to allege and hard to 19 disprove. 20 And, third, regardless of whether this Court 21 decides to extend the Hartman rule, the law in 2006, at 22 the time of the arrest was not clearly established, thus 23 entitling the agents to qualified immunity. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the probable -25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't

5

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the probable

3 cause? What was the probable cause for the arrest?

4 MR. GALLAGHER: Justice Ginsburg, the Tenth

5 Circuit found that the probable cause that -- that

6 underlies its opinion was a 10001 -- a 1001 violation,

7 lying to a Federal agent.

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Explain that to me.

9 That's a false statement to a government officer, but

10 that's not the reason -- 1001 wasn't the reason that

11 these officers had to arrest. They -- there was a

12 question of assaulting the Vice President, and I think

13 that the charge that eventually was made in the State

14 court was harassment. So, there's no indication that

15 these officers had 1001 anywhere in their minds.

16 MR. GALLAGHER: Well, two points, Justice

17 Ginsburg: First of all, under Devenpeck, officers are

18 not required to give all of the reasons behind an

19 arrest. But, second, and I think perhaps more

20 importantly in this case, when Agent Reichle contacted

21 Mr. Howards and made the arrest, Mr. Howards had lied to

22 him. That was relevant to a Secret Service agent's

23 assessment of the risk of the situation.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do they have to give -- at

25 least when you stop a car, the test is whether there was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
6 1 probable cause, not whether that was the reason that the 2 officer stopped the car. 3 MR. GALLAGHER: That's correct, 4 Justice Scalia. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: There was a broken 6 taillight. There existed probable cause, whether that 7 was the basis on which he acted or not. Now -- is it 8 any different when -9 MR. GALLAGHER: I don't think it's any 10 different -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: With respect to an arrest? 12 MR. GALLAGHER: Yes, with respect to an 13 arrest. This is ­ 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: So long as they have good 15 reason for an arrest, it doesn't matter. 16 MR. GALLAGHER: Absolutely. That's an 17 objective -18 JUSTICE BREYER: That -- we've never held 19 that in respect to a claim that the real reason the 20 police arrested was retaliation against, for example, a 21 picket sign having an unpopular point of view or a 22 statement having an unpopular point of view. That is, 23 this Court has never held that it overcomes an arrest 24 where there's a claim of retaliatory First Amendment 25 action; is that right?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
7 1 MR. GALLAGHER: That's right, and -2 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And what you're 3 saying is your first reason is that we should say that. 4 And the -- the question I wanted to ask you there is, 5 you make a very strong case where the President and Vice 6 President are involved, the need to protect them, but 7 the rule that you there adopt is a rule that will apply 8 to every police officer, anyone who arrests anyone 9 anywhere in the country, and no matter how clear it is 10 that the motive was retaliation against a point of view, 11 that individual will be protected from a Bivens action. 12 So, it sounds as if your first claim -- the 13 remedy sweeps well beyond the need that you sketch. And 14 so, I'd like your response to that. 15 MR. GALLAGHER: Justice Breyer, I think it 16 has to do with the determination in the Tenth Circuit 17 and the fact that the -- the Tenth Circuit's decision to 18 extend Devenpeck to these facts was not the subject of a 19 cross-appeal. So, the issue that you -- you posit is 20 not an issue that's before the Court. It was -21 JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. I'm 22 just saying if I agree with you on your first that if 23 there is a probable cause for an arrest, then wouldn't I 24 have to say there is no retaliatory First Amendment 25 claim when a border officer chases into Arizona a person

1 with whom he politically disagrees, and there are 14

8

2 bishops who will say he cared about nothing but his

3 political disagreement? And there's nothing to the

4 contrary, and he says: Oh, I happened to notice -- at

5 trial -- that when he left he reached out and snatched a

6 $5 bill that was in the till. And so, I had probable

7 cause to arrest him.

8 End of case. Now, that sounds very

9 far-reaching, and I don't know that I'm prepared to do

10 that. So, therefore, is there another way you might win

11 your case, or should I do that?

12 MR. GALLAGHER: Well, let me answer both of

13 those questions. What you've outlined is essentially

14 footnote 10 from the Hartman case. That's the footnote

15 that says what do you do if the -- if the person that

16 initiated the prosecution says, I did it for a -- a

17 retaliatory reason? And the Court side-stepped that

18 issue.

19 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

20 MR. GALLAGHER: Yes.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: And, of course, Hartman

22 dealt with prosecutions. But people all the time don't

23 arrest others. Policemen frequently don't arrest people

24 for everything they might arrest them for. I mean

25 jaywalking, to take an example. Or all kinds of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 things where they just normally don't arrest somebody. 2 You might -- or I'm sure you didn't, but I might 3 sometimes have driven 60 miles an hour in a 55-mile 4 zone. And I shouldn't even admit this. I hope I get 5 away with it. 6 (Laughter.) 7 JUSTICE BREYER: But -- but you see, it's 8 different arrests and prosecutions. 9 MR. GALLAGHER: Well, I ­ it certainly, 10 it's different, but the Devenpeck standard -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it different? You -12 you acknowledge that prosecutors always prosecute, that 13 they never exercise discretion and say, oh, what the 14 heck, you know? 15 MR. GALLAGHER: Certainly, Your Honor. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: All the time. All the 17 time. I don't know that it's any less frequent than -18 than an officer deciding not to arrest. 19 MR. GALLAGHER: And Justice -20 Justice Breyer, I think that the difficulty with your 21 hypothetical is, especially with regard to Secret 22 Service agents, who perform -- when they're engaging in 23 their protective functions, they're essentially -24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, that -25 MR. GALLAGHER: -- in the public eye.

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's exactly what 2 Justice Breyer is saying. Okay? Which is, as I 3 understand it -- and there's some literature that talks 4 about should we be treating misdemeanor arrests 5 different than felony arrests, because there's less 6 discretion that an officer would have with respect to 7 arresting someone for a felony than for misdemeanors or 8 criminal fines, because like jaywalking, policemen don't 9 arrest you for jaywalking unless they're either on a 10 ticket binge or because there's something about you that 11 they don't like. 12 MR. GALLAGHER: Sure. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, if that something 14 about you they don't like is that you're wearing an 15 antiwar armband, are we going to let that plaintiff not 16 recover, because somehow we need to protect police 17 officers so much, in the discretionary use of this vast 18 power they have to arrest that we're going to permit 19 them to trample the First Amendment, essentially? 20 Or are we going to say, in the normal 21 situation there is a First Amendment claim, even with 22 probable cause, if you can prove that it's the 23 motivating factor for the arrest; but we treat Secret 24 Service differently? 25 And I think that was the point
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Justice Breyer's getting to, and the one I'm most

11

2 interested in.

3 MR. GALLAGHER: Okay.

4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we don't extend.

5 Hartman, how do we in a principled way deal with the

6 unique needs of the Secret Service?

7 MR. GALLAGHER: Let me -- let me briefly

8 address the first half of the question, and then I'll

9 address the second half. The first half, when --

10 Justice Sotomayor, when you suggest that police officers

11 could trample on the First Amendment, it's important to

12 remember we still have probable cause as the -- as the

13 principal picture here.

14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you're jaywalking,

15 there's probable cause.

16 MR. GALLAGHER: But probable cause is the

17 Fourth Amendment standard specified by the Framers of

18 the Constitution.

19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but what does it

20 have to do with violating the First Amendment? Meaning,

21 if police officers have discretion and they would not

22 otherwise arrest you except for their dislike of your

23 speech, that's a violation of your right to free speech,

24 isn't it?

25 MR. GALLAGHER: Well, I'm not sure that that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 is exactly the case. Again it gets back to this

12

2 footnote 10 in Hartman, which -- which, there -- Hartman

3 can be read two different ways. It can be read as

4 saying that the elements of the constitutional tort

5 itself require the absence of probable cause, or it can

6 be read as saying the elements of the cause of action.

7 But let me -- let me address the second question.

8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We can go to that

9 question later.

10 MR. GALLAGHER: Yes. And the second

11 question has to do with Secret Service agents, because

12 Secret Service agents, unlike police officers performing

13 law enforcement functions, when Secret Service agents are

14 acting in a protective capacity, they are protecting our

15 Nation's leaders and they are doing so in a very public

16 way, and they are also doing so in a way that is

17 essentially a free speech zone.

18 Virtually everyone that a Secret Service

19 agent encounters when he's protecting the President or

20 the Vice President can allege that they're engaged in

21 free speech. So, for Secret Service agents in

22 particular, they -- they can legitimately evaluate what

23 someone is saying in order to determine a particular

24 threat level. And because of that, Secret Service

25 agents have a similar sort of complexity of causation to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the -- the situation addressed in the Hartman case.

13

2 Now, in Hartman, clearly it was a one -- it

3 was a two-individual causation situation, but with

4 regard to Secret Service agents, the causation is

5 similarly complex because Secret Service agents can

6 legitimately take into account what someone is saying in

7 order to determine a threat level.

8 Regardless of whether the Court decides to

9 extend the Hartman case, it's absolutely clear that the

10 law in 2006, in June of 2006 when the agents made this

11 arrest, was not clearly established. The Hartman case

12 was handed down in early 2006. It had only been on the

13 books about 3 months when the arrest was made. For that

14 reason, Secret Service agents should be entitled to a

15 qualified immunity in this case because the law was not

16 clearly established.

17 With regard to the -- the formulation of

18 qualified immunity that we are asking for, we believe

19 that it is important for Secret Service agents acting in

20 this protective capacity to have the requisite breathing

21 room in order to make decisions in life-or-death or

22 imminent-threat situations. In fact, the qualified

23 immunity that we're advocating is particularly important

24 at the margins, particularly important in situations

25 where it's not clear what a Secret Service agent can do

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1 or should do, where a Secret Service agent has to make a 2 snap decision in order to determine whether someone's a 3 threat and then act appropriately. 4 The Court in the Atwater case noted that the 5 object of -- of the Court's cases has been to draw 6 standards sufficiently clear and simple to be applied 7 with a fair prospect of surviving judicial 8 second-guessing, months and even years after the -- the 9 arrests are made. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're not suggesting 11 absolute immunity? 12 MR. GALLAGHER: No, we are suggesting a 13 qualified immunity that's -14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's a different kind 15 of qualified immunity? 16 MR. GALLAGHER: It's certainly different 17 from the Harlow type of qualified immunity. It is an 18 immunity that is contingent upon having -- contingent 19 upon the Secret Service agent being -- acting in a 20 protective capacity and having probable cause to make 21 the arrest. But, certainly, once the immunity attaches, 22 it would be -- it would be full immunity from a claim. 23 The Court noted earlier this term, in 24 Ryburn v. Huff case, that judges should be cautious 25 about second-guessing a police officer's assessment made
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 on the scene of the danger presented by a particular

15

2 situation. We think that this case aptly demonstrates a

3 situation in which Secret Service agents made very --

4 very difficult decisions on the spot, and they should

5 not be second-guessed by the Court.

6 Finally, with regard to the -- whether

7 qualified immunity is -- was clearly established in June

8 of 2006, the Ninth Circuit -- the primary case relied

9 upon by the Tenth Circuit was the Skoog case. The Skoog

10 case was the case that the Tenth Circuit relied upon in

11 holding that Hartman should not be extended.

12 It's important, though, when you review the

13 Skoog case to -- to read the entire case, because the

14 Skoog court, after concluding that -- that Hartman

15 should not be extended, still proceeded with the

16 qualified immunity analysis to determine whether the law

17 was clearly established at the time of the incident.

18 And what the Skoog case concluded was -- it looked at --

19 it looked at the nature of the right.

20 And, you know, we know from the

21 Anderson v. Creighton case that this Court has said it's

22 important when focusing on constitutional rights not to

23 look at the 30,000-foot level, not to look at the high

24 level, but to look at the contours of the right. And

25 that's what the Skoog case did.

16 1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 2 MR. GALLAGHER: All right. Thank you. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Srinivasan. 4 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN 5 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 6 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS 7 MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, 8 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 9 I'd like to start off addressing the Secret 10 Service in particular because that's the principal 11 focus, although I take the point that there are 12 questions about applying the rule in a broader context. 13 But I think understanding why the rule makes sense in 14 the context of Secret Service agents and law enforcement 15 officers who are performing similar protective functions 16 would help inform why it makes sense to broaden the rule 17 as well. What the Secret Service -18 I'll pick up on the point that Petitioners' 19 counsel was making, which is that it's legitimate in 20 this context for Secret Service agents to take into 21 account expressive activity in determining whether the 22 circumstances warrant a discretionary exercise of the 23 power to arrest. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I assume you would 25 include U.S. marshals?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes.

17

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: F.B.I. agents? So,

3 you're talking about protective details.

4 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct. And that's

5 why I wouldn't limit it to the Secret Service in

6 particular. I think what happens in a lot of these

7 contexts is that it's natural for these individuals to

8 encounter First Amendment activity by the public, and

9 it's legitimate for them to react to First Amendment

10 activity in deciding whether the circumstances warrant

11 an arrest.

12 And the problem arises because it's very

13 difficult to distinguish between, on one hand, a

14 legitimate consideration of expressive activity as

15 evidencing the sort of threat that warrants a response

16 from an illegitimate consideration of expressive

17 activity borne of a motive to suppress a viewpoint.

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does your rule apply

19 regardless of the degree of animus that the agent is

20 alleged to have had as to the particular view being

21 expressed?

22 MR. SRINIVASAN: I think it would,

23 Justice Kennedy, because we would have an

24 across-the-board, no-probable-cause requirement of the

25 kind that the Court applied in the retaliatory

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 prosecution context in Hartman.

18

2 Now, I think your -- the question of the

3 degree of animus asserted by the agent on the scene is

4 exactly why these are complicated factual questions.

5 Those kinds of allegations can be made, and then you're

6 going to have a trial where the agent is on the stand,

7 and the jury is going to have a very difficult time, and

8 the agent is going to have a difficult time explaining

9 why it is that he acted legitimately based on expressive

10 activity because he felt that there was a threat to the

11 person he was trying to protect, as opposed to

12 explaining that he didn't act in order to suppress the

13 viewpoint that was being asserted.

14 These kinds of allegations can often be

15 made. And, in fact, they can even be manufactured at

16 the scene by an intelligent person who's going to be the

17 subject of an arrest. And I think that complicated

18 question of causation is exactly why it makes sense to

19 apply in this context the same objective screening in

20 the form of a no-probable-cause requirement in Hartman

21 to this context of retaliatory arrest.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is there any difference

23 if -- when ordinary policemen are policing an authorized

24 demonstration --

25 MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
19 1 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- in front of this Court 2 or anywhere for that matter? The people making the 3 demonstration have -- have the same motivation and can 4 make the same assertion of, oh, the only reason you 5 arrested me was because you didn't like what I was -6 what I was talking about. So, why should that situation 7 be different? 8 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct, 9 Justice Scalia, and that was going to be my next point. 10 Once we understand why it is that it makes sense to 11 apply this rule in the context of officers who engage in 12 this sort of critical public protective functions of the 13 Secret Service, I think we understand why it also makes 14 sense to apply it in other situations, because law 15 enforcement can legitimately take into account 16 expressive activity when they're engaged in functions 17 such as crowd control. 18 And in those contexts as well, it's going to 19 be difficult to disaggregate the legitimate 20 consideration of expressive activity as evidencing a 21 threat -22 JUSTICE BREYER: Illegitimate? You just -23 MR. SRINIVASAN: -- from an illegitimate 24 desire to suppress a viewpoint. Sorry. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Look, you just used the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
20 1 word "crowd control." And I take it, in saying the word 2 "crowd control," you are making a distinction. 3 MR. SRINIVASAN: I'm making a -4 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want -- do you want 5 the same rule of automatic, you know, immunity -- it's 6 sort of automatic immunity -- when crowd control isn't 7 at issue, where there's a history of persecution of an 8 individual by a particular officer, da, da, da? I mean, 9 you know, we can make up cases. 10 MR. SRINIVASAN: I think -11 JUSTICE BREYER: Did you want it absolutely 12 across the board, or are you going to start making 13 distinctions? 14 MR. SRINIVASAN: I -- I would not draw a 15 distinction, Justice Breyer. Of course, there's going 16 to be factual situations -17 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I agree with you 18 about the crowd control. 19 MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: I see that. I see that 21 problem. I see the problem of protecting people in 22 public life; I see the problem in protecting the 23 President. 24 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think -25 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, how far -- now, given
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
21 1 that that's a particular problem where views are likely 2 to be evidentiary -- unpopular views actually are, 3 unfortunately, but how far do you extend it? You say 4 extend it to everything. To jaywalking, to 5 persecutions, to, you know -- that's what's making me a 6 little nervous. 7 MR. SRINIVASAN: Right, and I can understand 8 the basis for the nervousness. I guess the question for 9 the Court is whether the benefits of having an 10 administrable across-the-board rule outweigh the costs 11 of trying to forge some sort exceptions to deal with 12 extreme hypotheticals. And -13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have a sense of 14 how many of these First Amendment retaliatory claims in 15 those jurisdictions that permit them -- I know they're 16 more limited -- how many of these cases arise? 17 MR. SRINIVASAN: We do. We've done -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And with what frequency? 19 MR. SRINIVASAN: We've done an unscientific 20 search, but to use the same time frame of reference that 21 the Court used in Hartman, which is looking back 22 25 years, if you do a sort of standard Westlaw search, 23 what you'll see is there's roughly a hundred court of 24 appeals cases and 450 or so district court cases 25 where --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And how many arrests are 2 there a year? 3 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't know. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's -- a non-felony. 5 I'm sure it's in the millions. 6 MR. SRINIVASAN: It's -- the -- I'm sure 7 there are scores and scores of arrests. That's correct. 8 And, of course, all we're talking about is the cases 9 that get to the point where you have an opinion that can 10 be -- that can be found. And there's the obvious point 11 that, depending on what the Court does here, you may see 12 a proliferation of -- of those claims. And we certainly 13 hope that wouldn't be the case. 14 But I think on -- in -- on the question of 15 whether it makes sense to have an across-the-board rule, 16 I guess I would echo what Petitioners' counsel was 17 suggesting, which is you can have the same set of 18 considerations in the retaliatory prosecution context 19 because prosecutors do act with -- by hypothesis, with 20 illicit motives in some situations. 21 And the Court considered whether the 22 benefits of having an across-the-board rule outweigh the 23 costs of forging an exception to deal with extreme 24 circumstances. And what the Court said was: We want to 25 have a rule that's designed to deal with the mine run of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 cases; we don't want to have a rule that has an

23

2 exceptional-circumstances exception because in that --

3 at that point, there will be a great deal of litigation

4 concerning what cases fit within of the exception and

5 what cases don't.

6 And what the Court said was that's rather

7 like designing a retirement plan to deal with the

8 possibility that someone might win the lottery. That's

9 in footnote 10 of Hartman. And I think similar

10 considerations would weigh -- counsel in favor of

11 applying an across-the-board objective,

12 no-probable-cause screen in this context as well. And I

13 think it's important to understand that --

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though this -- I

15 think in Hartman, Justice Souter gave two specific

16 reasons, neither of which apply in this context. I

17 mean, this is -- it's the prosecutor who institutes the

18 charges, but the suit is not against the prosecutor, who

19 would be absolutely immune. So, that is not in this

20 picture. Here we have one officer.

21 So, it would certainly be an extension of

22 Hartman because the reason that Hartman gave for the

23 rule was tied to -- very much tied to prosecution rather

24 than arrest.

25 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I -- with respect,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Justice Ginsburg, I think this case is of a piece with

24

2 Hartman in two relevant respects. Your Honor is quite

3 correct that Justice Souter's opinion focused on the

4 fact that you have two individuals in play. You can

5 have that situation here, but we don't base it on that.

6 What the opinion was getting to was that

7 that creates complex issues of causation in the

8 prosecution context. And I think it was the complex

9 causation that really drove the need to have an

10 objective across-the-board rule.

11 You have the same kind of complex causation

12 problem here, for the reasons that I've explained, which

13 is that it's extremely difficult to disentangle a

14 legitimate desire to act -- to suppress danger, of which

15 speech is evidence, from an illegitimate desire to

16 suppress a viewpoint.

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You might apply the same

18 immunity for selective enforcement based on race?

19 MR. SRINIVASAN: The same immunity?

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

21 MR. SRINIVASAN: No. The -- they -- I think

22 the Court's decision in Whren, for example, supposes

23 that even though you have probable cause, you can have

24 an equal protection claim if the proof could be made --

25 and this is very important. In the equal protection

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 context, including for race, there is a different

25

2 objective screen in place, and it's a stringent

3 objective screen that this Court announced in Armstrong,

4 which is that --

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm aware of the

6 reservation in Whren. Why should there be a difference

7 in the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection and First

8 Amendment speech?

9 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think part -- part

10 of the reason is this, that in -- with the First

11 Amendment, expressive activity can legitimately be taken

12 into account precisely because it can manifest a danger,

13 whereas with race in the ordinary case, I think the

14 reason why we have these principles in the race context

15 is it's ordinarily not a relevant consideration.

16 And the Armstrong rule is designed to

17 distinguish between circumstances in -- in which race

18 was the motivation and in which race wasn't the

19 motivation. And it serves that purpose well. But it

20 doesn't work so well in this context, because here First

21 Amendment activity can legitimately be taken into

22 account; when, as in this case, a Secret Service agent

23 overhears an individual say that he's going to ask the

24 Vice President how many babies he's killed, it makes all

25 the sense in the world for the Secret Service to focus

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 their attention on that person.

26

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what about for

3 crowd control? You want to extend it to crowd control

4 as well. What difference does the First Amendment make

5 there?

6 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think it's -- the

7 nature, intensity, and vehemence with which the First

8 Amendment activity is being engaged in can inform an

9 officer on whether the circumstances present the kind of

10 danger that warrants a law enforcement response.

11 So, I -- and when a law enforcement officer

12 does that, he's going to be subject to potential

13 liability if an individual says: Look, you weren't

14 reacting against me because of the way I was expressing

15 my views; you were acting -- reacting against me because

16 you disagree with my views and you wanted to suppress

17 them.

18 And that's a very hard thing to disentangle.

19 And it not only has that problem at the back end, but it

20 results in a problem at the front end as well, because

21 what happens at the front end is that officers at the

22 very outer margins might have in the back of their mind

23 a concern that if they acted based on their best

24 intuitions about what kind of law enforcement response

25 is warranted, they might later be subject to suit based

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 on a mistaken assumption and potentially an ability to

27

2 convince a jury that they were acting based on an

3 illegitimate desire to suppress a viewpoint rather than

4 on a legitimate desire --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: How many cases -- you might

6 know this; you might have information on how many cases

7 over 5 years or whatever period there actually have been

8 against Federal protective officials of retaliatory

9 First Amendment activity.

10 MR. SRINIVASAN: I -- I don't know --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: It would be in the

12 Department, wouldn't it? Do they keep track?

13 MR. SRINIVASAN: It's potentially there, but

14 I just -- I don't have the answer at my disposal,

15 Justice Breyer.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: Do we know that this is not

17 unique, the one before us?

18 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, these -- certainly,

19 we know that these kinds of interactions arise with some

20 frequency. I think there was some publicity surrounding

21 the --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: But when you looked up your

23 research for this, did you find any other case in which

24 anyone had ever asserted a First Amendment claim of

25 retaliation for an arrest?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. SRINIVASAN: In --

28

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, against a Federal --

3 MR. SRINIVASAN: In this --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Against a Federal

5 protective official.

6 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, I -- candidly, I didn't

7 -- we didn't conduct a search with that object in mind.

8 So, I can't give you an answer one way -- one way or the

9 other.

10 I did want to make one additional point,

11 Justice Ginsburg, in response to the question you posed

12 about the applicability of Hartman, which is that at one

13 level it applies, the rule should apply, because the

14 same concern with complex causation is at issue here at

15 well -- as well.

16 But the other way to think about the

17 applicability of Hartman is to -- is to put these cases

18 on a spectrum. On one end, you have what the Court in

19 Hartman identified as a standard retaliation case, of

20 which the Court identified public employment as the

21 archetypal example. And on the other end, you have

22 retaliatory prosecution, where the Court thought that

23 there were sufficient concerns about complicated

24 causation that it made sense to have an across-the-board

25 objective rule.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 Now, the question could be where does 2 retaliatory arrest fit within that spectrum? Is it on 3 the retaliatory prosecution side or is it on the public 4 employment side? And for a couple of reasons, I think 5 it fits decidedly within the retaliatory prosecution 6 side. 7 One is the one I've given, which is that 8 speech can legitimately be taken into account. And so, 9 it creates complex causation. But the other one is in 10 some sense the flip side of that, which is that in the 11 -- in public employment context, the standard fact 12 pattern is going to involve a long-term relationship 13 between an employer and an employee, during which time 14 there's been no adverse action; the employee then 15 engages in some sort of expressive activity, in the 16 aftermath of which the employer undertakes some adverse 17 action such as a termination. 18 Now, in that context it makes sense to infer 19 that there may well be an illegitimate speech -20 speech-suppressive motivation at work, because you have 21 in some sense a control period in the interactions 22 between the employer and the employee that pre-dated the 23 expressive activity. 24 That's not the case when you're dealing with 25 law enforcement. In the law enforcement context in the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
30 1 main, this is a one-time interaction between an officer 2 and a suspect, the arrestee. You don't have the prior 3 relationship that acts as a control. And so, you have 4 to ask the question whether, based on that one-time 5 relationship, is there a basis for inferring that a 6 speech-suppressive motivation was at work? 7 And here, because it can be legitimate for 8 an officer to take into account speech in deciding 9 whether this situation is the kind of one in which a law 10 enforcement response is warranted, it makes sense, 11 unlike in the public employment context, to apply the 12 same objective across-the-board screen in the form of a 13 no-probable-cause requirement that you have in 14 prosecutions. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I go back to the 16 probable cause, the question I asked before? It's not 17 like the taillight. 1001 came up in court. I -- this 18 situation may well have warranted probable cause for 19 assault, probable cause for harassment. But where did 20 -- but the 1001 was not the -- was in no one's mind. It 21 does seem quite strange. 22 MR. SRINIVASAN: It was not, Your Honor. Of 23 course, that's exactly what happens in the Fourth 24 Amendment context. That's -- that was the issue before 25 the Court in Devenpeck, and the Court explained in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Devenpeck why it makes sense to have an objective

31

2 probable cause inquiry rather than a subjective one.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But doesn't it matter

4 that it's something that comes up only in court; it's

5 not something that -- I mean, why wasn't the natural --

6 well, one would expect probable cause to arrest because

7 it was an assault or harassment -- the actual charges

8 that were made?

9 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't know the reason

10 that a -- I don't know the precise contours of the

11 harassment charges in State court that were made. I

12 think that they mapped on in some measure to the

13 assault, the assault that was suspected by the -- by

14 Officer Reichle, who effected the arrest.

15 Now, I think the concern with importing some

16 sort of subjective probable cause dimension into the

17 inquiry -- if you asked, you know, what offense did the

18 officer in fact have in mind, it's the same concerns

19 that drove the Court to apply an objective rule in

20 Devenpeck, including, for example, that you would have

21 dis-uniformity, in that similarly situated individuals

22 would be treated differently based purely on what

23 happens to have been in an officer's mind.

2 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. LANE

3 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4 MR. LANE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

5 may it please the Court:

6 I think what we have here is a solution

7 being offered by the Government, and now we have to go

8 find the problem. And I think that's what

9 Justice Breyer's question was directed at here.

10 I have done, not a scientific search, but I

11 can take credit for a little bit of science involved in

12 determining how many such cases arise. And at page 13

13 of our brief, we cite in footnote 8 that a search with

14 no time limitations whatsoever going back in LEXIS with

15 the words "Bivens" or "1983," "retaliatory arrest," not

16 limited to protective details, shows 15 reported Federal

17 appellate cases, with no time limitations whatsoever.

18 So, we have a solution, but we really don't

19 have a problem. The only Secret Service case that this

20 Court has ever heard that I'm aware of involving

21 anything remotely like this is Hunter v. Bryant. So,

22 this is not a significant problem.

23 This also factually is probably not the best

24 case for them to be making their argument that we need

25 some sort of special rules that apply to the Secret

Alderson Reporting Company

33 1 Service, given the facts of this case, where Mr. Howards 2 by all accounts walked over to the Vice President, 3 looked at him and said: "I just want you to know I 4 think your policies in Iraq are disgusting." 5 There is a dispute at that point whether he 6 gently patted him on the arm -- not a crime -- or tapped 7 him on the shoulder -- again, not a crime -- or -8 JUSTICE BREYER: There's no -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's an assault, isn't 10 it? 11 MR. LANE: I'm sorry. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: All it takes for an assault 13 is an unwanted touching. 14 MR. LANE: Well, incidental contact is not 15 an assault, and everyone on the Mall -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not incidental if you 17 reach out and touch somebody on the shoulder or the arm. 18 MR. LANE: Well, the problem is that the 19 Vice President was on the Mall having contact with 20 numerous people, shaking their hands, letting them pat 21 him on the back, telling him what a great job he's 22 doing. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine, and he didn't 24 -- he doubtless didn't consider those contacts hostile. 25 But when somebody tells you "I think your policies are
Alderson Reporting Company

1 disgusting" --

Official

34

2 MR. LANE: And then --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, just don't tell me

4 that it's -- it's not a crime. It is an assault if it's

5 an unwanted touching.

6 MR. LANE: Well, under Colorado law, he was

7 charged with harassment, and --

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what you've

9 described is not when the person was arrested, right?

10 MR. LANE: That's correct.

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The person was

12 arrested later, when approached by the Secret Service

13 agent, lied about whether he touched the Vice President;

14 at that time, in a non-protected area, was carrying a

15 bag, right?

16 MR. LANE: Correct.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And wandering

18 around. Turns out that he was looking for his son. But

19 if you're the Secret Service agent, you see somebody who

20 said your policies are disgusting, that person touches

21 the Vice President, he -- he lies to you. He

22 comes back, he's carrying a bag and he's wondering --

23 wandering around, do you think it's reasonable at

24 that -- well, I guess you don't --

25 (Laughter.)

35 1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To arrest the 2 person? 3 MR. LANE: That's a multifaceted question. 4 I'll try my best to cut right to it. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The reason it's 6 multifaceted is because I'm trying to capture what might 7 have been going through the Secret Service agent's mind 8 at the time. 9 MR. LANE: Well, that's -- that is part of 10 the point I have to make here, all right? In this 11 Court's jurisprudence on Fourth Amendment issues, what 12 is going on in the agent's mind is irrelevant. The 13 issue is -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what would be 15 going in a reasonable Secret Service's agent's mind at 16 the time. 17 MR. LANE: Right. First level of inquiry, 18 was there a Fourth Amendment violation? No, according 19 to the Tenth Circuit. We then have got to shift gears 20 if we're going to do a First Amendment analysis. And is 21 this a retaliatory arrest or not? 22 We have got to look into the subjective mind 23 of the agent. That's where Justice Ginsburg's questions 24 I think take on great import for this discussion, 25 because, as she correctly pointed out, the agents on
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
36 1 scene never said in deposition, they have never claimed 2 anywhere, that they arrested Mr. Howards on a 1001 3 violation. 4 The agents on scene in deposition said we 5 arrested him because of the way he approached the Vice 6 President -- not a crime -- and his demeanor. We 7 thought it might be an assault. That later morphed into 8 a State charge of harassment. Nobody ever said 1001 9 formed any basis whatsoever. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but they did say -11 and also you've left out that one of the agents 12 overheard him say he was going to ask the Vice President 13 how many babies he killed that day. 14 MR. LANE: Right. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, their job is to 16 protect the Vice President. 17 MR. LANE: Absolutely. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: That's their job. 19 MR. LANE: Correct. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: And it's a very emotional 21 subject. 22 MR. LANE: Absolutely. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: And if something happens to 24 the President, nobody's going to say, oh, you know, what 25 were you doing? And the whole country is in mourning.
Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. LANE: Correct.

37

2 JUSTICE BREYER: We understand that. And,

3 therefore, it's a matter of concern that the -- if you

4 have a rule of law that says to the agents, when you

5 hear someone who says how many babies are you going to

6 kill that day, I'm going to ask the Vice President, I'm

7 going to touch him, I am going to then tell them a lie

8 when they ask me if I touched him -- that's cause for

9 concern.

10 MR. LANE: Absolutely.

11 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, if there's a

12 lawsuit, the agency will say we just can't do it. We

13 can't do it. We can't use that as a basis for stopping

14 that individual.

15 MR. LANE: Well, that --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: All that poses a problem.

17 Now, you're -- and I -- I think -- I recognize it as

18 a problem. I'm not saying I have the solution.

19 MR. LANE: Well, I think you hit on the

20 solution as part of the problem you just expressed, and

21 that is, can they stop this individual? And the answer

22 is "absolutely yes." They have every arrow in their

23 quiver, under Terry v. Ohio. They can stop him if they

24 perceive a threat. They can force him to open up his

25 opaque bag. They can force him to show them what's in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the box inside the opaque bag. They can pat him down.

38

2 They can wand him with a metal-detecting wand. They can

3 assure themselves --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it wouldn't be a

5 violation of the First Amendment if they only did that

6 because they didn't like the ideas he was expressing?

7 MR. LANE: They are allowed --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wouldn't that be a

9 violation of the First Amendment?

10 MR. LANE: They are allowed to take

11 reasonable steps under Terry, under every conceivable

12 case that this Court's ever decided.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though they're doing

14 it for -- they do it for a racial reason, would that be

15 okay?

16 MR. LANE: No. No. What I'm saying --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course not. I don't see

18 how your -- your First Amendment exception doesn't apply

19 to those things as well as to --

20 MR. LANE: It would.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to the arrest.

22 MR. LANE: It would. If he could prove that

23 they did a Terry stop on him in retaliation for his free

24 speech and it was motivated -- and I know this -- Your

25 Honor's feelings about intent -- intent-motivated

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 constitutional torts.

39

2 But if he could prove that the Terry stop

3 was motivated by -- in an effort to punish him for his

4 free speech, yes, that would be a cause of action as

5 well.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what you have,

7 under your theory, a person should put on his car a

8 bumper sticker that says "I hate the police" and then

9 every time they're pulled over, they will have --

10 certainly a plausible case is you violated my First

11 Amendment rights. It's not because I was going 60 miles

12 an hour; it's because of my bumper sticker.

13 MR. LANE: Well --

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the police

15 officer -- at that point, he says, you know, I can't

16 give a ticket to this guy without being hauled into

17 court on personal liability because he's got a credible

18 case that it was for First Amendment grounds.

19 MR. LANE: Well, I think we can look at

20 the -- as I've said, the arrows in the quiver of the

21 Court to weed out those kinds of cases.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. You've

23 already got the officer in court. I mean, you get a

24 speeding ticket, and most times they don't show up

25 because they have got other things to do. Now he's got

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
40 1 to show up in district court, in State court, to defend 2 against this. 3 MR. LANE: Well, I mean, litigious 4 plaintiffs are a consistent problem across the board 5 under many contexts. And there's really -- you know, 6 there's almost nothing that can be done. This Court has 7 taken steps to cut back prison litigation that's 8 frivolous, things of that nature. 9 But, yes, if -- the heightened pleading 10 standard this Court enunciated in Iqbal: You can't just 11 come up with conclusory allegations. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Well, 13 this -14 MR. LANE: You have to have facts in support 15 that that's why they stopped me, because of my bumper 16 sticker. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that -- is that a 18 case that you could state? 19 MR. LANE: That would be -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He pulled me over, 21 he gave me a speeding ticket, but the only reason he 22 picked me out is because I had a bumper sticker saying 23 "I hate the police." 24 MR. LANE: Well -25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does that go to
Alderson Reporting Company

1 trial?

Official

41

2 MR. LANE: No, that doesn't necessarily go

3 to trial. That's a conclusion, first of all --

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why doesn't it go to

5 trial? And -- well, does it go -- I mean, do you get

6 depose the police officer? You know, why did you stop

7 him? Did you stop anybody else for going 65 miles an

8 hour that day?

9 MR. LANE: Well, I mean, these evidentiary

10 questions have to be first of all supported in a

11 pleading with heightened scrutiny under Iqbal.

12 Conclusions are not simply enough. You have --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a conclusion. I

14 mean, if -- if he didn't have the bumper sticker and you

15 asserted in the pleading he stopped me because he knows

16 I hate the police, that's a conclusion. But if you have

17 the bumper sticker, he says, you know, I had the bumper

18 sticker, and that's why he stopped me.

19 MR. LANE: Well, let me give the flip side

20 of that and say if the police officer did stop him

21 because of the bumper sticker, he should go to trial.

22 He should be held accountable for that.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, the only way you

24 can find out is you put in the evidence -- here's the

25 bumper sticker -- and you put the police officer on the

Alderson Reporting Company

1 stand --

Official

42

2 MR. LANE: Well --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and you say, why

4 did you do it?

5 MR. LANE: Under --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then all of a

7 sudden -- I don't know why everybody doesn't have a

8 bumper sticker.

9 MR. LANE: Theoretically, every single

10 person who has ever been arrested for any crime could

11 raise a first amendment retaliation lawsuit. Every

12 convicted murderer doing time throughout this country

13 could do that. They don't, however. There is -- there

14 is not a rush to the courthouse of retaliatory arrest

15 claims because the pleading requirements are heightened.

16 Qualified immunity for over a hundred years has

17 protected the Secret Service. They've been protecting

18 the executive branch --

19 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, say, though, that in

20 the case of the President, what you're hearing is, as

21 you well know, that the combination of disparate

22 political views and risk is unlike other situations.

23 And I don't know if they can prove it or you could prove

24 the contrary, but that's -- that's a claim. And I can't

25 say there's nothing to it.

Alderson Reporting Company

43 1 So, let me suggest to you another arrow 2 which ­ I'll ask you what you think of this arrow, and 3 the answer's going to be not much, but I'm interested 4 in hearing -5 MR. LANE: Go ahead. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: -- your reason. 7 MR. LANE: I'm ready. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: In -- in Hartman, Justice 9 Ginsburg and I dissent. 10 MR. LANE: Yes. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: And we referred to a D.C. 12 Circuit case. And in the D.C. Circuit, it said -- it 13 talked about rare cases "where strong motive evidence 14 combines with weak probable cause to support a finding 15 that the prosecution would not have occurred but for 16 the ... animus." Now, so far, you think "fine." 17 But suppose you were to say because of the 18 factors that have just been mentioned where the 19 President's at stake, the courts -- where his life is at 20 stake, the President's -- the courts will not infer once 21 probable cause exists that it's weak. And the courts 22 will not infer from the simple presence of political 23 disagreement that the motive of retaliation is strong, 24 which in fact would produce a very limited extension of 25 Hartman to the case of protecting the President of the

2 And now, I know you're not going to agree

3 with that, and I'm trying it out and I'm not saying I

4 agree with it, but I want to see what you -- how you

5 react.

6 MR. LANE: Well, let's take a look at the

7 facts of this case. The Tenth Circuit found there was

8 probable cause for a 1001 violation. But was there

9 probable cause -- is there a great body of

10 circumstantial evidence surrounding this case that would

11 point to probable cause which should be considered in

12 deciding how this case proceeds? We have the agent in

13 charge of the protective detail, Agent Lee, standing 8

14 inches away from Vice President Cheney when this entire

15 encounter occurs. Agent Lee testified he saw no crime

16 committed. We had numerous agents --

17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me.

18 MR. LANE: Yes, Your Honor.

19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's go past that for a

20 second. What was it that the arresting agent said or

21 did that showed the animus? Meaning, because that

22 another officer actually saw it and understood himself

23 what he thought doesn't mean that this agent who was

24 told that there had been a touching had that

25 information.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. LANE: The evidence --

45

2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, I know collective

3 knowledge is a theory in a lot of cases, but let's deal

4 with the facts of this case. What's the animus?

5 MR. LANE: Well, there were discrete First

6 Amendment episodes that occurred in the context of this

7 case. One was testified to by Mr. Howards in his

8 deposition, that when he first of all was approached by

9 Agent Reichle, Agent Reichle said, "I want to talk to

10 you," and flashed his badge, and Mr. Howards declined

11 the invitation to talk to Agent Reichle. That,

12 according to Mr. Howards, angered Agent Reichle. That

13 is a First Amendment significant event in and of itself.

14 Steve Howards testified that he then was

15 asked by Agent Reichle: We want to talk to you about

16 assaulting the Vice President. And his response was: I

17 didn't assault the Vice President; I merely criticized

18 his policies in Iraq, and if you don't want him

19 criticized publicly he should stay in his undisclosed

20 location. Or words to that effect.

21 Again, Mr. Howards testified that angered

22 Agent Reichle. At that point, the cuffs went on. And I

23 think that is circumstantial evidence in support of the

24 animus for what -- what was going on. Agent Reichle was

25 on notice as to what Howards had said to the Vice

Alderson Reporting Company

1 President --

Official

46

2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How does all of that

3 prove your point of animus in light of the undisputed

4 fact that he lied about touching the Vice President?

5 MR. LANE: Well, again --

6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that's the --

7 MR. LANE: -- lying to the Vice President is

8 what we look at on a Fourth Amendment analysis, because

9 what's in Reichle's actual mind under Devenpeck is

10 irrelevant. So, yes, there was probable cause, but was

11 Reichle himself directing his animus at Mr. Howards and

12 arrested him? We have to look into what was actually in

13 his mind, and that was not in his mind. A 1001

14 violation was not in his mind. We looked -- what was in

15 his mind? And we've already said what was in his mind

16 is he approached the Vice President, he criticized him

17 publicly --

18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You do understand that

19 this case is inviting the questions the Chief Justice

20 asked, which -- and which -- as Justice Breyer and some

21 of us are concerned about, which is what your adversary

22 has described as First Amendment voicing is going to be

23 a part of many, many arrests.

24 MR. LANE: Absolutely.

25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do we draw a line

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 outside of the one that you proposed by your

47

2 adversaries, that probable cause is the line?

3 MR. LANE: Well, that line --

4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That doesn't enmesh the

5 police in a constant barrage of claims that just because

6 they angered a police officer, that's why they were

7 arrested.

8 MR. LANE: Well, first of all, there has not

9 been this constant barrage. Hartman has only applied

10 until -- I mean, this Court decided Hartman in 2006 for

11 retaliatory prosecutions. There has not been a run on

12 the courthouse on retaliatory arrests --

13 JUSTICE ALITO: Would you --

14 MR. LANE: -- either before Hartman or

15 after.

16 JUSTICE ALITO: Would you acknowledge that

17 the Secret Service faces a different situation from

18 ordinary police officers in conducting their daily

19 activities, in that Secret Service agents may

20 legitimately take into account First Amendment activity

21 by someone who is in the vicinity of the President or

22 the Vice President in assessing the degree of danger the

23 person presents?

24 MR. LANE: This may not help my case, but

25 I'll go further than that and I'll say any police

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 officer has an absolute right to listen to what any

48

2 protester is saying and consider what is being said in

3 terms of assessing the level of threat that that

4 protester poses.

5 But as I said in this case, they had every

6 right to stop Mr. Howards, to do a Terry stop on him,

7 because they were concerned about him. And reasonable

8 cause for concern under Terry is the standard. You

9 don't need probable cause to pat someone down under

10 Terry. It's simply if a reasonable officer would be

11 concerned.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Again, I don't understand

13 why you -- why you say that they're immune from the

14 charge of First Amendment retaliation for that but not

15 immune from the charge of First Amendment -- I mean --

16 MR. LANE: I'm not --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you say they're doing it

18 on First Amendment grounds for the one, they're doing it

19 on the First Amendment grounds for the other. Why is

20 either one okay?

21 MR. LANE: I'm not saying that they're

22 immune on a Terry pat down if it's done in retaliation

23 for free speech. I'm simply saying that would make it a

24 much more difficult case for any protester to go to a --

25 to go to court and say the only reason he patted me down

Alderson Reporting Company

1 is in retaliation for my free speech.

49

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, then putting it

3 in their point of view, I just what he actually said.

4 He was very angry, your client. I mean, judging what he

5 said -- there were a lot of swear words and so forth --

6 he was pretty angry at this whole situation.

7 So, you're a Secret Service agent, and you

8 hear him say -- speak like this -- he has every right to

9 speak like that. I mean people do. I understand that.

10 But now he's also thinking that -- I'm nervous about

11 this. The President is here, the Vice President,

12 whatever --

13 MR. LANE: Sure.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: -- same thing -- and I've

15 got to do my job. So -- and nobody's going to say, ho,

16 ho, First -- whatever if is -- if somebody is hurt.

17 MR. LANE: I agree with that.

18 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, he has also lied about

19 whether he touched the President.

20 MR. LANE: So --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: And he has also been

22 talking about the President killing people.

23 MR. LANE: First order of business --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Killing babies and so forth

25 and --

Alderson Reporting Company

50 1 MR. LANE: Let's see if he's a threat. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, what is he 3 supposed to do in your view? 4 MR. LANE: He's supposed to -- if he -- if 5 he has reasonable cause to believe Steve Howards is a 6 threat -7 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it is in this 8 situation -9 MR. LANE: Okay. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: But this situation, I've -11 I'm pretty -12 MR. LANE: Right. Then he pats him down. 13 He opens the bag -14 JUSTICE BREYER: Nothing there. 15 MR. LANE: Nothing there. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: He says, okay -17 MR. LANE: Then they monitor him, and they 18 watch him, and -- and that's all. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: A lot of people in 20 that place. 21 MR. LANE: There is no probable cause to 22 believe he has committed a crime at that point. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, he lied. He -24 MR. LANE: But they didn't know that. That 25 was not in their minds. That's -- we're doing a First
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
51 1 Amendment analysis and not the Fourth Amendment analysis 2 at this point. First Amendment analysis -3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they didn't 4 arrest him -- they didn't arrest until after he lied, 5 right? 6 MR. LANE: But it was never in their minds. 7 They testified. That didn't have anything to do -- that 8 is the Tenth Circuit's post hoc rationale under 9 Devenbeck, which -- Devenpeck -- which says you -- if 10 there's any objective probable cause that the Tenth 11 Circuit or this Court or any other court can concoct, 12 post hoc, even though it wasn't in the officer's mind, 13 that's good enough to arrest somebody. That's -- that 14 probable cause. All right? 15 But in First Amendment analysis, it can't be 16 an objective standard. There -- objective standards are 17 clean, they are nice, they -- they create bright lines. 18 But when we are looking at a First Amendment violation, 19 we have to got to be able to get into subjective intent 20 of the officer at -- on the scene. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: And when you say that, that 22 means that almost all of these cases have to go to 23 trial -24 MR. LANE: No, they don't. 25 JUSTICE ALITO: -- before a jury.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
52 1 Well, how are -- how can they be stopped before they go 2 to trial? 3 MR. LANE: Because if -- first of all, as 4 I've said, Iqbal requires heightened pleading, not just 5 conclusions. We have the summary judgment standard. 6 JUSTICE ALITO: I engaged in First Amendment 7 -- I engaged in First Amendment activity. 8 MR. LANE: We have a summary judgment 9 standard, where -- and, in fact, in Butz, this Court 10 held that a firm application of rules of civil procedure 11 will always prevent frivolous claims and meritless 12 litigation from occurring in situations exactly like 13 this. And that's true. A firm application of the rules 14 of civil procedure, a summary judgment standard, which 15 is -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, summary 17 judgment, that's -- you've already been in court for a 18 long time when you're talking about summary judgment. 19 MR. LANE: There's no easy way out of this, 20 unfortunately. Frequently, when you're talking about -21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is an 22 easy way out of it. We could agree with the -23 (Laughter.) 24 MR. LANE: Well, that, unfortunately, is an 25 easy way out of the First Amendment as well. I mean,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
53 1 this Court has decided some incredibly difficulty cases. 2 Snyder v. Phelps, authored by Your Honor, very difficult 3 case. Could it be side-stepped, by -- you know, 4 somebody steps off a curb and is thereby jaywalking? 5 Are we limiting -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One thing about your 7 analysis that concerns me is that you seem to have a 8 very black-and-white view of what's going on in the 9 officer's mind: Did you stop -- did you arrest him 10 because of retaliation or was it because of legitimate 11 security? 12 And I suspect that the people engaged in 13 this type of thing have intuition. I mean, they don't 14 sit there and say, well, let's see; is it because he 15 says he didn't like the war in Iraq, or is because he's 16 wandering around, looks like he's looking for something, 17 with a -- with a bag? I mean, I assume they sort have 18 experience and they calculate all this in and say I've 19 got to do something. And how do you parse those 20 different motivations? 21 MR. LANE: Well, what I say about that 22 is that -- and, again, I know this is not an answer that 23 you're probably going to like, because this means a 24 trial is involved, but this is what juries do on a daily 25 basis throughout this country, in every criminal case.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 What is the subjective intent of the defendant? In

54

2 every civil case, is this an intentional act, a knowing

3 act, a reckless act, a negligent act? That's what

4 juries do.

5 And if there's enough evidence to get this

6 case to trial -- and I would posit it that in this case,

7 where you have agent after agent after agent who saw the

8 encounter up close and personal with the Vice President

9 and Mr. Howards, none of whom saw any evidence of any

10 criminal activity by Mr. Howards, all of whom let Mr.

11 Howards walk away from the scene, that's good evidence

12 that --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One reason that I,

14 in fact, don't like the answer is because what the agent

15 is now going to have to factor -- in addition to the

16 hostility of the views, the touching of the Vice

17 President, the lying about it, the wandering around with

18 the bag -- is in the back of his mind, you know, if I'm

19 wrong, I may be held personally liable in damages for

20 taking some action that some jury somewhere is going to

21 say was based on retaliation rather than my obligation

22 to protect the Vice President.

23 MR. LANE: Well, I mean, theoretically yes,

24 that could be a problem. And I am quite certain that

25 certain civil litigants -- just as in criminal cases,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 people are wrongly accused of things that they didn't

55

2 do, they end up in a trial, and sometimes juries get the

3 wrong results and an injustice occurs.

4 We can't fix all those problems when it's

5 not really a significant problem. There are no run on

6 the courtrooms around the land of these kinds of cases

7 arising. We don't need to have any rules that

8 specifically pertain to the Secret Service when, to my

9 knowledge, this Court has had one Secret Service case in

10 its entire history, and there are 15 appellate reported

11 Federal decisions regarding retaliatory arrests,

12 period --

13 JUSTICE ALITO: Which -- is there a record

14 of retaliatory arrests by Secret Service agents against

15 people who say things that are critical of the President

16 and the Vice President?

17 MR. LANE: The only way I know to look for

18 that is on Westlaw or LEXIS. And Mr. Srinivasan

19 indicated that they found 100 or 400 cases. We did a

20 search like that. We came up with the same number. We

21 dug down into those cases. And in terms of actual

22 litigated retaliatory arrest cases, we found 15 total.

23 That's not scientific, but that's the best I've got for

24 you at this point.

25 And I don't know if there is a repository of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 where we can find that or not. But this -- and I

56

2 started this argument by saying this is a solution in

3 search of a problem. The Secret Service has adequately

4 done their jobs beautifully over -- for over a century.

5 And there is no reason to put some different rule down

6 on the Secret Service.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we lost a couple of

8 Presidents, didn't we?

9 (Laughter.)

10 MR. LANE: Well, they're doing the best they

11 can. I mean, that's -- I understand that. But it is --

12 it is a serious, serious issue to curtail the First

13 Amendment.

14 Consider the situation where you actually

15 do -- and I believe this is that case -- you have Secret

16 Service agents who deserve to be taken to a trial

17 because they have gone out of their way to punish

18 someone for their free speech.

19 What do you do about those guys?

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's ambivalent. I

21 mean, suppose it turns out you have this trial. We know

22 what words were spoken. Get to the trial; it turns out

23 Reichle is a strong opponent of the war in Vietnam.

24 Then, end of trial, right?

25 MR. LANE: You know, that would be a fact to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
57 1 be considered by the jury. I could lose this trial when 2 we go back, if we get a trial. That's what -- that's 3 what jury trials are all about, Justice Ginsburg. 4 And I'm not saying that I have to show 5 evidence to this Court that I'm going to win the trial 6 before I win this case. The issue simply is, can we 7 sacrifice the First Amendment? You know, does a 8 litterbug lose their right to have First Amendment free 9 speech, does a jaywalker lose their right to have First 10 Amendment free speech because probable cause exists to 11 believe they've committed some offense? And you'll have 12 officers ostensibly enforcing litter laws and jaywalking 13 laws and blocking-the-sidewalk laws, and First Amendment 14 is essentially evaded. 15 A hundred years of jurisprudence, courageous 16 jurisprudence, many times by this Court, goes by the 17 boards because somebody is a litterbug. I just don't 18 see that as the solution to this problem, and I also 19 don't see that the Secret Service needs some enhanced 20 protection from this Court when this has never been and 21 is not now any kind of a serious problem. 22 The status quo is Mount Healthy. It has 23 worked for decades, and it should continue to work. And 24 if these agents get tagged in this case, maybe they 25 deserved to get tagged in this case, because the First
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
58 1 Amendment is extremely important. And I don't denigrate 2 the job of law enforcement or these agents in any way. 3 I'm simply saying that when the First 4 Amendment is at stake, I think -- and the law has been 5 working just fine throughout decades, to extend the no 6 probable cause in Hartman to on-street encounters where 7 there is no complex causation chain, where the main 8 actor in Hartman was immune completely from lawsuit -9 the prosecutor in Hartman could not be sued under any 10 circumstances, nor could the prosecutor in Hartman be 11 questioned in deposition under our traditions. We don't 12 question prosecutors in depositions about why they made 13 decisions to go ahead and prosecute. So, this Court 14 stepped back in Hartman and said that's a different 15 story. 16 But on-street encounters -- if you extend 17 the no-probable-cause requirement to on-street 18 encounters, any rogue police officer, or Secret Service 19 agent, who wants to can ostensibly enforce any number of 20 legal violations -- 1 mile an hour over the speed limit, 21 you're going to jail allegedly for going 1 mile an hour 22 over the speed limit; or under Atwater, for not wearing 23 a seat belt -- when the real reason is your bumper 24 sticker. 25 If you can prove that, they should go to
