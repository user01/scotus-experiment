 2 (10:04 a.m.)
 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 now in No. 02-763, Jo Anne Barnhart v. Pauline Thomas.
 5 Mr. Lamken.
 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN
 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 8 MR. LAMKEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 9 please the Court:
 10 As the Commissioner of Social Security has long
 11 construed the disability insurance program, there can be
 12 no finding of disability unless at least two conditions
 13 are met. First, the claimant's impairment must be of such
 14 severity that she cannot -- she is unable to do her 15 previous work. Second, the impairments must be of such
 16 severity that the claimant cannot, considering her age,
 17 education, and experience, engage in any other kind of
 18 substantial, gainful work which exists in the national
 19 economy.
 20 Construing and applying those provisions for
 21 more than 3 decades, the commissioner has consistently
 22 concluded that if a claimant continues to function at a
 23 level sufficient to meet the demands of past work, then
 24 the claimant is not disabled without the necessity of
 25 inquiring into whether that particular past job exists in

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 significant numbers. That's the most natural reading of
 2 the statutory text.
 3 QUESTION: Mr. Lamken, this case, I think,
 4 involves provisions of both title II and title XVI of the
 5 act, and there are regulations under each.
 6 MR. LAMKEN: That is correct. It is --
 7 QUESTION: Now, are there any relevant
 8 differences in the text of the two statutes or the regs on
 9 this issue?
 10 MR. LAMKEN: No, Your Honor. We don't believe
 11 that there are any relevant differences, that the
 12 commissioner's regulations and the statutes themselves are
 13 all phrased in parallel if not identical language
 14 throughout.
 15 There is one difference in that for a disability
 16 insurance, these title II provisions, you have to be
 17 someone who has paid into the program in order to be
 18 eligible for benefits on the way out; whereas, title XVI
 19 is more of a welfare program where whether you've paid in
 20 in the past doesn't matter. But that simply means that
 21 one who has paid into the title II program would get
 22 considerably more benefits than one who has not.
 23 QUESTION: But on the test.
 24 MR. LAMKEN: On the test, it is an identical
 25 test.

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: There's no difference. 
 2 MR. LAMKEN: There is no test, Justice O'Connor.
 3 QUESTION: Thank you. 
 4 MR. LAMKEN: That construction preserves the
 5 distinction long recognized in the commissioner's
 6 regulations, in fact, recognizing the commissioner's
 7 regulations from the earliest days of administering this
 8 statute. Between disability insurance, on the one hand,
 9 and insurance against other causes of unemployment, such
 10 as technological and economic change, on the other, an
 11 individual who's doing a job who remains fully capable of
 12 doing that job, but then loses the job because of economic
 13 change or perhaps the job never existed in significant
 14 numbers and the individual chooses to leave, is not unable 15 to engage in that activity by reason of an impairment,
 16 which is the test under the statute for being entitled to
 17 benefits. 
 18 And it made sense for Congress to draw that line
 19 because if someone continues to function at a level
 20 sufficient to meet the demands of their previous work,
 21 it's virtually certain that they're capable of doing some
 22 work whether or not that particular past job exists in
 23 significant numbers in the national economy. The point
 24 isn't that the person is expected to return to that
 25 particular past job. Rather, it is their continued

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 functioning at a level sufficient to meet the demands of
 2 that job provides a highly accurate and administrable test
 3 of the fact that they continue to function at a level
 4 sufficient to meet the demands of work generally. 
 5 In a program that must resolve more than 2
 6 million claims a year, the need for that type of a highly
 7 administrable test, that type of highly accurate test is
 8 particularly acute. And this is precisely the type of
 9 test one would have expected Congress to provide.
 10 A potentially large number of Americans today do
 11 not work in jobs that exist in significant numbers in the
 12 national economy. When those workers leave their jobs,
 13 whether they quit, are fired for misconduct, or leave for
 14 other reasons which are good and sufficient, the court of 15 appeals would preclude the commissioner from denying them
 16 benefits based on their continued capacity to do that past
 17 job even if that job is still available to them, even if
 18 the employer is on the phone begging them to return to the
 19 job. The commissioner reasonably construed the statute as
 20 not compelling that result.
 21 If there are no questions, I will reserve the
 22 remainder of my time for rebuttal. 
 23 QUESTION: I have a -- a question about the
 24 consistency of the argument you're now making with the --
 25 with the commissioner's regulation concerning you don't go

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 back more than 15 years. That seems to be a recognition
 2 that even if a person can do the job that he or she did 15
 3 years ago, yet there's a likelihood that maybe that kind
 4 of work isn't in abundant supply anymore.
 5 MR. LAMKEN: Justice O'Connor, the concern of
 6 that 15-year --
 7 QUESTION: I'm Justice Ginsburg. 
 8 MR. LAMKEN: Oh, Justice Ginsburg. 
 9 The concern of that regulation isn't whether or
 10 not that particular past job exists in significant
 11 numbers. It provides an administrable and in fact
 12 prophylactic test to make sure that the demands of that
 13 job are demands that are ones that are likely to be
 14 relevant in the national economy. 
 It's unlikely that a 15 set of demands of a job would completely disappear from
 16 the economy entirely during any one person's lifetime.
 17 But to make assurance doubly sure, to make
 18 absolutely certain, the commissioner has set forth an
 19 administrable bright line, 15-year rule that says if the
 20 job is more than -- if you did the job more than 15 years
 21 ago, we won't consider it out of that concern. But it is
 22 not a consideration of whether the particular past job
 23 exists. It's a consideration to make sure that your
 24 continued ability to the demands of that job is an
 25 appropriate and accurate measure of your ability -- your

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 level of functioning, and that your level of functioning
 2 is consistent with work generally. 
 3 If there are no further --
 4 QUESTION: May I ask this question just about
 5 the facts of this case, Mr. Lamken? When this applicant
 6 suffered her physical impairment -- I forget just what it
 7 was now -- she was able to go out and find a job as a -- a
 8 -- an elevator operator. Right?
 9 MR. LAMKEN: That's correct. From -- if I
 10 remember correctly, from 1988 to 1995, she worked as an
 11 elevator operator.
 12 QUESTION: If the absence of elevator jobs had
 13 occurred earlier and she hadn't been able to find this
 14 job, she would clearly be disabled, wouldn't she? 15 MR. LAMKEN: No, Justice Stevens, I'm not sure
 16 that she would be found disabled. The commissioner would
 17 have gone through the steps and -- and determined whether
 18 or not she had a severe --
 19 QUESTION: She would have made the fifth step.
 20 MR. LAMKEN: If you were not to consider the --
 21 the previous work of an elevator operator and you only
 22 applied the fifth step, which is the other work step, in
 23 isolation, that's correct, that she would have been found
 24 not able to do other work in the national economy. But
 25 the fifth step is designed to work in conjunction with all

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the other previous steps and, standing alone, does not
 2 necessarily represent an accurate determination.
 3 Congress provided two conditions that must be
 4 met, previous work and other work, precisely because the
 5 somewhat abstract inquiry into other work that plaintiff
 6 has -- the claimant has never done may not be a fully
 7 accurate or necessarily an easily administered mechanism
 8 for determining the level of work that the claimant can
 9 do.
 10 QUESTION: See, the thought that was running
 11 through my mind, just to put it on the table, is that in a
 12 sense perhaps the Government's position creates a
 13 disincentive to look for other marginal jobs when you're
 14 in this position. 
 You might be better off just not to 15 look.
 16 MR. LAMKEN: Justice Stevens, the commissioner's
 17 rules actually take into account incentives to look for
 18 work through the unsuccessful work attempt regulations. 
 19 And so that is something that has been dealt with. And
 20 the same -- the same problem existed in the Walton case,
 21 for example. It is unfortunate that sometimes people, by
 22 engaging in socially desirable conduct, going out and
 23 working, will actually provide the evidence that shows
 24 that they're capable of working, but that is just a
 25 necessary consequence of a program that --

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Capable of working in a disappearing
 2 species of jobs.
 3 MR. LAMKEN: Well, Justice Stevens, the key
 4 point about the court of appeals decision is not limited
 5 to cases of job obsolescence. It's any time somebody is
 6 working in a job that may never have existed in
 7 substantial numbers. If they leave that job for whatever
 8 reason, if they quit or are fired for misconduct, under
 9 the court of appeals rule, the commissioner cannot deny
 10 them benefits based on their demonstrated ability to do
 11 that job.
 12 QUESTION: Suppose in Justice Stevens'
 13 hypothetical the employer said, you know, you can operate
 14 the elevator but it's just going to be going for 6 months. 15 We're rehabbing the building and after that -- it's just a
 16 6-month job.
 17 MR. LAMKEN: Right.
 18 QUESTION: Then -- then is she again barred
 19 under step four?
 20 MR. LAMKEN: Justice Kennedy, that would -- it
 21 would depend on whether or not that sort of a temporary
 22 position would qualify as substantial, gainful work under
 23 the commissioner's regulations. If it is a make-work
 24 position or it's a position that does not represent
 25 functioning at a level -- it's a sheltered position or it

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 is some other -- some other reason that it is not evidence
 2 of functioning --
 3 QUESTION: No, no. She can -- she can perform
 4 the elevator job completely well.
 5 MR. LAMKEN: If this is something --
 6 QUESTION: Everybody knows it's a -- it's a job
 7 that's soon to be obsolete, and she's told that.
 8 MR. LAMKEN: Justice Kennedy, I think --
 9 QUESTION: She'd be better off not taking that
 10 job.
 11 MR. LAMKEN: In terms of getting --
 12 QUESTION: Or suppose -- or -- or suppose she
 13 didn't take that job. Would she then still be barred?
 14 MR. LAMKEN: 
 If the -- if she did take the job, 15 Justice Kennedy, and the job represented functioning at a
 16 level that's consistent with work generally that is
 17 substantial, gainful work, she would be barred. And she
 18 perhaps might be better off not taking the -- taking a job
 19 like that under the commissioner's regulations. 
 20 However, the mere fact that somebody taking a
 21 job provides evidence that they function at a level that
 22 is consistent with past work doesn't mean that we should
 23 come up with less accurate determinations by ignoring
 24 their demonstrated capacity to engage in their -- in their
 25 past work.

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 If there are no further questions. 
 2 QUESTION: Yes.
 3 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. --
 4 QUESTION: One -- one -- just one further
 5 question. In -- in this case if she made it to step five,
 6 it wouldn't be just a question that the burden would be
 7 switched to the Government, she would automatically
 8 prevail. Isn't that the case? Because of her age?
 9 MR. LAMKEN: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. 
 10 The -- the way the commissioner's grids are set up, they
 11 make various assumptions regarding the effects of age, the
 12 exertion levels demanded by particular jobs, and other
 13 matters. And because it is a somewhat hypothetical
 14 inquiry to look into the many jobs somebody hasn't done in 15 the past, the step five inquiry sometimes will render --
 16 will deem somebody not -- will deem somebody disabled even
 17 though they actually can work.
 18 It is precisely because of that reason that
 19 Congress provided two measures of capacity to work: a
 20 highly empirical one, can the person do the jobs they
 21 actually have previously done in the past; and second,
 22 whether or not the person can engage in the other jobs
 23 that they haven't actually done in the past. And because
 24 the two steps work more accurately together, that's why we
 25 -- one of the reasons we believe that Congress provided

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 those two steps. 
 2 In addition, it also preserves the line between
 3 people who become unemployed because of their impairment,
 4 and ones who happen to be fully capable of doing their
 5 past jobs but lose those jobs for whatever reason, such as
 6 either technological obsolescence or they simply choose to
 7 leave those jobs voluntarily. 
 8 If there are no further questions. 
 9 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Lamken.
 10 Mr. Alter, we'll hear from you.
 11 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ABRAHAM S. ALTER
 12 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 13 MR. ALTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
 14 the Court:
 15 Today the commissioner argues against its own
 16 theme of providing a remedy when someone is disabled.
 17 Congress did, indeed, intend to make a
 18 difference, to separate step four, previous work, from
 19 step five, or other work, but Congress told us what that
 20 separation is.
 21 At the fourth step, previous work, age is not a
 22 factor, education is not a factor, and prior work
 23 experience is not a factor. This is simply because if a
 24 person wasn't too old to do his job or her job in 1995, we
 25 assume they weren't too old to do it in 1996. If a person

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 had the requisite education and skill level to perform the
 2 past job in 1995, then they have the same skill level and
 3 education level in 1996. And of course, prior work
 4 experience is irrelevant at step four because we're
 5 talking about the actual job that she did.
 6 What Congress didn't intend was to pretend that
 7 a job that doesn't exist can still be used to deny
 8 benefits. Work has to be substantial. The commissioner
 9 concedes that. It has to be gainful. The commissioner
 10 concedes that. And it has to exist.
 11 QUESTION: But your -- no. It has to exist in
 12 substantial numbers in the national economy. What you're
 13 -- you're arguing that a job that does exist and that this
 14 particular supposedly disabled person used to perform and 15 which is offered to that supposedly disabled person but
 16 which that person turns down can, nonetheless, not count
 17 against the person's disability.
 18 MR. ALTER: That is correct, Justice Scalia. 
 19 QUESTION: So it seems to me it's your position
 20 that -- that presents a really extraordinary situation. 
 21 Let's say I'm a juggler, and I become disabled. And --
 22 and the circus I was a juggler at comes and says, you
 23 know, we -- we want you back. We can't find another
 24 juggler. There aren't that many because there are not
 25 that many juggler jobs in the national economy. Okay? 

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 And I turn them down. I say, I'm tired of juggling. And
 2 you say that I'm handicapped even though my -- my prior
 3 job is -- is right there waiting for me. That seems to me
 4 an extraordinary result.
 5 MR. ALTER: That is exactly what I'm saying,
 6 Judge Scalia -- Justice Scalia. I'm sorry. And the
 7 reason I say that is because a person is not disabled or
 8 not disabled at any one step of the sequential evaluation. 
 9 Your Honor's question focuses on the immediate reason for
 10 the disengagement of the person from the workforce. 
 11 That's not the commissioner's position. That hasn't been
 12 the commissioner's position. A person is not disabled or
 13 not disabled because of Ringling Brothers calls them on
 14 the phone and says, please, come back. 
 They are disabled 15 by operation of the sequential evaluation.
 16 And the commissioner is the one who promulgated
 17 the sequential evaluation. And the sequential evaluation
 18 is a recipe with alternating steps regarding medical and
 19 vocational factors. And --
 20 QUESTION: The commissioner has explained that
 21 it's -- using this test, can you perform your most recent
 22 job, as a proxy for instead of testing people to see the
 23 range of light work that exists in the economy. They say,
 24 we're just using this as a shorthand because it's
 25 administratively convenient. And it's not using it to

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 say, this person can do this job that's obsolescing,
 2 therefore she is not disabled. This particular job is a
 3 proxy for other jobs that require the same skill level.
 4 Now, what's wrong with taking that position
 5 instead of subjecting people to a whole battery of tests?
 6 MR. ALTER: Justice Ginsburg, your rendition of
 7 the commissioner's argument is exactly correct. If I were
 8 permitted to ask a question, I would ask myself a proxy
 9 for what. It is a -- the job doesn't exist. So,
 10 therefore, her ability to do the job --
 11 QUESTION: In substantial numbers in the
 12 national economy.
 13 MR. ALTER: National economy.
 14 QUESTION: 
 The very job may exist and be open 15 for her to take.
 16 MR. ALTER: Correct, but in most cases it
 17 wouldn't be open for her to take. That's the extreme
 18 position where -- and that's our position that happened in
 19 this case. And that's a very extreme position. And it
 20 would be an unintended consequence of the statute.
 21 But Your Honor is absolutely correct that that
 22 is their position, that past work, even if it doesn't
 23 exist in substantial numbers, is a proxy for her ability
 24 to do other work. What other work?
 25 At the fifth step, she's disabled because she

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 would not be able to make an adjustment to other work
 2 which exists in substantial numbers in the national
 3 economy, according to the commissioner's statistics.
 4 QUESTION: Well, it's not according to the
 5 commissioner. It's according to the statute.
 6 Can -- can we focus on the -- on the words of
 7 the statute? It says that the mental impairments --
 8 physical or mental impairments are of such severity that
 9 he is not only unable to do -- not only unable to do his
 10 previous work, but cannot, considering his age, education,
 11 and work experience, engage in any other kind of
 12 substantial, gainful work which exists in the national
 13 economy. 
 14 Now, you want to take that last phrase, which 15 exists in the national economy, and attribute it to the
 16 earlier phrase, previous work. But if that's what
 17 Congress meant, why wouldn't they just have said that he
 18 is unable, considering his age, education, and work
 19 experience, to engage in any substantial, gainful work
 20 which exists in the national economy?
 21 You -- you want to effectively read the first
 22 phrase, is not only unable to do his previous work, right
 23 out of the statute. They may just as well have dropped
 24 it. We don't read statutes to contain words that are
 25 totally superfluous, and you have made them totally

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 superfluous.
 2 MR. ALTER: On the contrary, Your Honor. The
 3 words, any other kind, would be superfluous. Congress,
 4 indeed, intended to make a difference between previous
 5 work and any other kind of work, and that difference is,
 6 besides age, education, and prior work experience, which
 7 are irrelevant at step five -- they wanted to have the
 8 burden on the claimant for disability to show at the first
 9 four steps that she is disabled.
 10 At the fifth step, it is the commissioner who
 11 must show that she isn't disabled. And that's why the
 12 words, which exist in the national economy, are in there
 13 to begin with because what they wanted to preclude was the
 14 commissioner saying, well, you can't do your prior job, 15 but you can be a juggler.
 16 QUESTION: Well, you see -- can we go back for a
 17 second to Justice Ginsburg's question? Does this -- I
 18 mean, your reading of it is a possible reading, I -- I
 19 agree. But they're saying their reading makes
 20 administrative sense.
 21 Now, this is my understanding of it. A person
 22 has a bad back. Now, there are bad backs and bad backs,
 23 but it's not a good thing to have. So she has a bad back,
 24 and we want to know how bad it is. And they're saying if
 25 it's very bad, she automatically is going to get the money

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 because at step three they'll look and see and say, look,
 2 this is a pretty bad back. It meets our criteria. That's
 3 the end of it.
 4 But if it's medium bad, then what they're going
 5 to say is, well, first question is can she still do her
 6 last job as an elevator operator. And if the answer to
 7 that question is yes, that's the end of it.
 8 And, therefore, if the answer, however, is no,
 9 then we've to go and gear up our vocational experts. Are
 10 there dolls' eyes' sewers? You know, they have a few odd
 11 jobs they usually bring in here --
 12 MR. ALTER: I know. 
 13 QUESTION: -- to show they exist in the national
 14 economy. 
 And -- and we get -- we don't want to go through 15 that rigmarole.
 16 So for a medium bad back, if you can still do
 17 your previous work as an elevator operator, you're not
 18 that handicapped. That's the end of it. Go to the
 19 unemployment office. Don't go to the -- the health
 20 office. 
 21 Now, what -- that to me makes sense. Now, what
 22 to you doesn't make sense?
 23 MR. ALTER: Oh, it doesn't make sense at all
 24 Your Honor, to me, obviously. 
 25 (Laughter.) 

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: No, no. Well, go ahead. 
 2 MR. ALTER: Your Honor's question seems to make
 3 step four, previous work, a gauge as to how severe the
 4 severe impairment is.
 5 QUESTION: Exactly, and I think they suggest
 6 that might be so. 
 7 MR. ALTER: And -- but step four, previous work,
 8 is a remedy that the commissioner can use for their
 9 convenience. Why look at every job in the national
 10 economy? Let's start here and see if that medium bad back
 11 would preclude her from her past job. But to what end? 
 12 So that she can resume that job. It seems to me, Your
 13 Honor, that once --
 14 QUESTION: 
 So you're not saying it is to that 15 end because it's the unemployment office that's concerned
 16 about people who are out of work because you don't have
 17 elevator operators in the economy anymore. That -- it's
 18 not the Social Security office, they say, which is
 19 concerned about people who are physically hurt or mentally
 20 hurt.
 21 MR. ALTER: Number one, Your Honor, Pauline
 22 Thomas could never collect unemployment insurance because
 23 the first thing they would ask her, are you ready,
 24 willing, and able to work? Do you have any medical
 25 problems? Once she has a severe impairment, at step two

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the unemployment argument, issue, or -- or controversy is
 2 over. Once she shows -- because that's the threshold. 
 3 When the -- when the statute says, by reason of a
 4 medically determinable impairment, it doesn't mean
 5 exclusively for medical reasons. But once she shows that
 6 medical impairment, to who? To the satisfaction of the
 7 commissioner. Once the commissioner says, yes, you have a
 8 severe impairment, then vocational issues, such as, okay,
 9 you can do a job, but does the job exist, become paramount
 10 because the -- the purpose of the statute, it seems to me,
 11 is to provide a remedy. 
 12 Now, there are two remedies that are possible
 13 after this sequential evaluation process. Remedy one,
 14 there are no jobs existing in significant numbers in the 15 national economy that you can do. So here's your
 16 benefits. Remedy two, you know what? There are jobs
 17 existing, whether it's your job, whether it's another job. 
 18 And therefore, we've done you a favor. We've told you
 19 that the economy can accommodate you after your injury. 
 20 Therefore, go get that job.
 21 QUESTION: Mr. Alter, if --if we think the
 22 statute may have certain ambiguities in it, why don't we
 23 owe deference to the Secretary's regulations and
 24 interpretation, which has been pretty consistent through
 25 the years? 

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ALTER: There are three answers to that
 2 question, Your Honor. First of all, I'm -- I'm
 3 crestfallen that -- that the Court would find that there's
 4 ambiguity. But given that -- that they would --
 5 QUESTION: If we think there is. 
 6 (Laughter.) 
 7 QUESTION: And if we're not crestfallen.
 8 (Laughter.) 
 9 QUESTION: Pick up your crest and go on, Mr.
 10 Alter. 
 11 (Laughter.) 
 12 MR. ALTER: If the statute is ambiguous, the
 13 commissioner's construction must still be reasonable. 
 14 Here, I would say it is not reasonable. That's the first. 
 15 Because it -- it begs reality. The reality is this job
 16 doesn't exist in substantial numbers. Or at least, we
 17 want to be able to show that at an administrative hearing.
 18 QUESTION: Mr. Alter, how do you deal with the
 19 fact that a number of circuits and, indeed, three judges
 20 on this en banc court thought exactly that, that this was
 21 an ambiguous regulation, that it had been applied
 22 consistently by the Secretary, and that it was entirely
 23 reasonable, the -- the notion that your current work is a
 24 proxy for can you do light work, that that's a -- not a
 25 necessary or inevitable one, but a reasonable one?

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ALTER: Justice Ginsburg, first, let me take
 2 the -- the last part of your sentence. Proxy to do light
 3 work. She wins at light work at step five. So again,
 4 it's a proxy to do light work.
 5 QUESTION: No. Step five in her case we've
 6 established is an automatic. It's not that she's shown
 7 that she can't do light work. The commissioner says,
 8 look, when you get to be 55 years old, we're not going to
 9 mess with that. If you can't do your prior job, that's
 10 it.
 11 MR. ALTER: But it's the reason why, Your Honor,
 12 because she can't make an adjustment to any jobs. If a
 13 person can do light work, that proxy issue, she can do her
 14 past job which is light, then she can do other light jobs. 15 But the commissioner tells us that she won't be able to
 16 adjust to other light jobs. And will she be able to
 17 adjust to her current job? There is no adjustment to a
 18 current job, unless the job doesn't exist. 
 19 But to answer your question about the other
 20 circuits, the other circuits -- circuits focused on the
 21 regulation, focused on the ruling, 82-61. That says,
 22 well, it doesn't make a difference whether the job exists. 
 23 It's whether you can do that job. And most of the other
 24 circuits said, well, the regulation says do your past job
 25 -- a strict reading of do your past job means the capacity

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 rather than a reality standard. But they didn't focus on
 2 the statute. 
 3 And if I might answer Judge -- Justice
 4 O'Connor's question about ambiguity, if I haven't answered
 5 your question. 
 6 QUESTION: No, you haven't because there's
 7 another piece of it. For the future, regulation that
 8 doesn't apply in your case, the -- the commissioner has
 9 clarified that what we mean is can you do the physical
 10 aspects of this job and we don't look to see whether it's
 11 an obsolescing job, a brand new regulation that doesn't
 12 apply to your case. 
 13 On your argument, I take it -- you're going now
 14 back to the statute -- that new regulation is an 15 impermissible construction of the statute.
 16 MR. ALTER: That is exactly correct, Your Honor.
 17 May I, Justice O'Connor, answer your question? 
 18 The deference owed to their -- the commissioner's
 19 construction of the statute is not much. It's Skidmore
 20 deference. 
 21 QUESTION: What?
 22 MR. ALTER: Skidmore deference, Skidmore v.
 23 Swift.
 24 QUESTION: Oh, I thought you said Skinmore. 
 25 (Laughter.) 

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ALTER: Chevron, the -- the great case, the
 2 elephant in this room -- Chevron has a two-step policy. 
 3 The first one has been precluded by Your Honor's question,
 4 whether the statute is ambiguous. The second part says,
 5 well, it owes great deference to the commissioner's
 6 position, but not, Your Honor, in a construction of a
 7 statute. It is this Court's role to tell us what the law
 8 is and what the law means. 
 9 QUESTION: Now, what does Chevron amount to? I
 10 mean, if -- if you're -- it struck me always that the --
 11 the first step is is the statute ambiguous, and second, if
 12 it is, is -- is the construction reasonable. It is by
 13 definition a construction of the statute you're talking
 14 about in the second step.
 15 MR. ALTER: Yes, Your Honor, but I believe under
 16 U.S. v. Mead the Court did make a distinction between a --
 17 an administrative policy --
 18 QUESTION: But Mead was -- but Mead was not a
 19 Chevron case.
 20 MR. ALTER: Mead was a construction by an agency
 21 case, and Mead says, I think -- my -- my reading is that
 22 if a -- an administrative policy is at issue, great
 23 deference has to be given. But a construction of a
 24 statute -- an agency does not have deference, great
 25 deference, because of administrative --

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: I -- I rather thought that's what
 2 Chevron was all about. I'm interested that you don't
 3 think so.
 4 MR. ALTER: Well, my reading, Your Honor, is
 5 that Chevron deference will only apply to an agency's
 6 statutory interpretation if it emerged from a formal
 7 adjudication.
 8 QUESTION: I certainly don't see that in Mead. 
 9 I -- I mean, I understand that there have been views
 10 around taken from the dissent I think, that maybe that's
 11 what it says, but when I read it about 17 times now --
 12 (Laughter.) 
 13 QUESTION: -- it didn't seem to say that. I
 14 mean, it said that -- that certainly if they have formal 15 proceedings, that would be a strong ground for thinking
 16 that we would apply Chevron. And if they didn't, it
 17 doesn't mean we won't. Did you get all the double
 18 negatives? 
 19 (Laughter.) 
 20 MR. ALTER: I understand. All I can do is
 21 assert that if Chevron means that if we find some sort of
 22 ambiguity in a Federal statute, we give pretty much carte
 23 blanche to the agency. That was my reading of Chevron. 
 24 That would be a disappointing reading of Chevron because I
 25 think --

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: If it's reasonable. If the agency
 2 has given it a reasonable construction. And from former
 3 questions this morning, the suggestion is that the
 4 regulatory approach is kind of an administrative shortcut
 5 for finding out whether this employee is basically able to
 6 do certain types of light work.
 7 MR. ALTER: I would argue, Your Honor, that it
 8 is not reasonable in any -- by any stretch of the word
 9 because may I remind, Your Honor, that we're talking about
 10 a job which may not exist at all, and a finding that a
 11 person is not disabled because they're capable of doing a
 12 job that doesn't exist can't be reasonable. If we take --
 13 I -- I say that --
 14 QUESTION: Why is that? What does -- what does
 15 disabled have to do with doing a job? I mean, disabled is
 16 a -- is a physical condition, and they say if you can do
 17 the job you used to do, you're not disabled.
 18 MR. ALTER: Your Honor --
 19 QUESTION: The word is disabled, not unemployed. 
 20 Unemployment insurance is something different. It's a
 21 different program. This program is not meant to provide
 22 for unemployment. It's meant to provide for disability.
 23 MR. ALTER: But what I meant --
 24 QUESTION: And all the -- all the Secretary is
 25 saying is if you can do your prior job, you're not

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 disabled. That seems quite logical to me. I --
 2 MR. ALTER: Let me try to highlight the
 3 illogical parts of that then, Your Honor. 
 4 Unemployment has nothing to do with this
 5 litigation. The person has a severe impairment. As a
 6 matter of fact, let's be precise. The person has cardiac
 7 arrhythmias. The person had a heart attack and returned
 8 to work. The person had a -- a herniated disc and
 9 cervical radiculopathy. According to the commissioner's
 10 construction here, the only job in the world that she
 11 could adjust to is a job which may not exist.
 12 Once she has a severe impairment, Your Honor can
 13 bring up unemployment for the rest of the session, but
 14 unemployment is a red herring in this case because once 15 you have a severe impairment, we're not talking about
 16 unemployment anymore. We're talking about --
 17 QUESTION: Then she should -- we should have
 18 ended it at step three, but the commissioner makes a
 19 distinction. And her impairment, because it wasn't on the
 20 chart, doesn't make it. She is not at that point
 21 disabled. You have to go on to the next step. If she
 22 were disabled, that would be the end of it and we wouldn't
 23 -- but she isn't disabled under this formulation because
 24 she's not within the conditions that that's the end of the
 25 examination.

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ALTER: Justice Ginsburg, your question and
 2 Justice Scalia's question seem to me to define disability
 3 in a vacuum. She is disabled -- she isn't disabled
 4 because she can do a job. Suppose she can be -- she be --
 5 she can deliver ice. That job doesn't exist anymore
 6 either. Suppose she could be a court jester. Disability
 7 has --
 8 QUESTION: You're the one that -- that is tying
 9 disability to employment, not -- not Justice Ginsburg and
 10 I. And -- and yet, you keep saying that -- that
 11 unemployment insurance is a red herring. You're the one
 12 that keeps bringing it in. You -- you say we can't tell
 13 whether the person is disabled unless the person can get a
 14 job, but that's not the statutory requirement for 15 disability.
 16 MR. ALTER: Your Honor, I am not saying that a
 17 person is disabled unless they can go get a job. What I'm
 18 saying is that disability means that a medical impairment
 19 prevents you from adjusting to work which exists in the
 20 national economy.
 21 QUESTION: And they are saying, to take your
 22 example, if you're a former iceman and you're still strong
 23 enough to deliver ice, you're probably able to do other
 24 jobs. What is unreasonable about that, even if there's no
 25 ice delivery anymore?

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ALTER: Because at step five, when the
 2 commissioner says that you cannot adjust to other jobs, I
 3 take them at their word. Statistically, according to the
 4 commissioner's sequential evaluation, according to the
 5 commissioner's vocational rules, there will not be an
 6 ability to adjust to any other job which exists in the
 7 national economy.
 8 QUESTION: And -- and at the point at which you
 9 get to step five, you've already found that the person
 10 can't deliver ice anymore. So there has already been a
 11 finding of some disability to some degree irrespective of
 12 the capacity to go to a nonexistent job. I mean, the --
 13 the proxy determination has already been made before you
 14 get to step five. Isn't that right?
 15 MR. ALTER: That is correct, Your Honor. 
 16 QUESTION: That's what step four is there for.
 17 MR. ALTER: That -- that is correct, Your Honor,
 18 but we keep getting back to that proxy, that word proxy. 
 19 Well, even if your job doesn't exist, it's a proxy for
 20 your ability to do other jobs. But what other jobs?
 21 QUESTION: Well, if you're an -- first of all, I
 22 don't know why it doesn't exist. We have elevator
 23 operators in this building.
 24 MR. ALTER: Yes, Your Honor. I gave her my
 25 card. 

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: All right. So -- so, I mean --
 2 (Laughter.) 
 3 QUESTION: It points out a certain unrealism. A
 4 person who works in an elevator is a pleasant person, and
 5 they sit down for some of the day and they're up --
 6 standing up for some of the day. And they have to see
 7 that people get on and off properly. It requires a degree
 8 of intelligence. It requires a degree of personality. It
 9 requires a certain degree of skill. And so there -- you
 10 would have thought there would have been a lot of other
 11 jobs like that in the economy. And, I mean, even if there
 12 aren't too many elevator operators, there are some.
 13 I mean, I'm trying to point out the realism that
 14 they say exists behind their -- their assumption there. 15 And it's pretty hard. We're talking about -- it's really
 16 hard to find an example that fits the category you want to
 17 say this is in. 
 18 MR. ALTER: Your Honor's question about the
 19 elevator operator is a -- a serious one because an
 20 elevator operator we have in this Court pushes buttons. 
 21 Yes, there's personality involved, but I -- I don't think
 22 that one of these individuals would be denied this job if
 23 she didn't have a sterling or -- or a wonderful
 24 personality. She pushes buttons. That's not what my
 25 client did. My client operated an elevator.

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 The reason we have elevator operators in this
 2 building, I'm assuming, is to add to the majesty of the
 3 building, for security purposes so I don't wander up and
 4 down the halls where I'm not supposed to go. There are
 5 elevator operators in luxury buildings which really act as
 6 security or helping people with parcels.
 7 This person pushes a button, and she's here for
 8 a reason, which really has nothing to do with what my
 9 client was doing. She was opening a gate and opening a
 10 door, et cetera, and pushing the actual buttons, and
 11 operating -- well, you've -- everyone has seen an elevator
 12 operator from the old days. 
 13 The point is -- the point is that all we want to
 14 do is show -- an opportunity to show what every SSI 15 claimant can show. I believe it was Justice O'Connor who
 16 -- who asked is there a difference between the regulations
 17 in title II and title XVI, and my colleagues said
 18 correctly, no, there aren't.
 19 How about this? How about Pauline Thomas never
 20 worked a day in her life? She was on welfare her whole
 21 life. She doesn't have a step four. We treat people
 22 under this construction who have worked, as Pauline Thomas
 23 does -- and I promised her I would say this, so I'm going
 24 to say it -- for 27-and-a-half years, 110 quarters of
 25 coverage. And she paid in all that time, sweeping and

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 cleaning, and mopping bathrooms in a nursing home, and had
 2 a heart attack and went back to work. We don't treat her,
 3 under this construction, as well as we treat a person who
 4 never worked a day in her life because then she
 5 automatically goes to step five where she's disabled. 
 6 That's the first prong. 
 7 The second thing -- I don't know if the Court
 8 has an actual transcript, but how do we treat this person
 9 differently? Pauline Thomas will get -- this controversy
 10 is about $672 a month in disability benefits after 27-and-
 11 a-half years. If she had not worked a day in her life --
 12 QUESTION: Mr. Alter, can we go back to one
 13 thing that you said I don't think was quite right? You
 14 said all we want is an opportunity to show. That's not
 15 so. If you get to step five, you win, and the Government
 16 has conceded that. You don't have to show anything. So
 17 you're looking for -- you say if -- step four, if she
 18 prevails on that, that is the end of the inquiry. You
 19 will not -- it's not incumbent on you to show anything.
 20 MR. ALTER: In this particular case, if we get
 21 to step five, we will win. But what we want to show is
 22 not -- obviously, Ms. Thomas wants the benefits and I want
 23 to win the case. But what we would be showing is that
 24 past work is not a proxy for another kind of work if the
 25 past work doesn't exist because we want to be able to show

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 -- it's what we already know -- that the commissioner says
 2 that there is no ability to adjust to another job. Here,
 3 if her job doesn't exist, she will have to adjust to
 4 another job whether we call it her past job or not.
 5 What I want to --
 6 QUESTION: She did work at this job for -- well,
 7 7 years, did she not?
 8 MR. ALTER: Correct.
 9 QUESTION: Because she -- at one point in your
 10 brief, you said that she had been an elevator operator. 
 11 At page 42, you said for a few months. That was wrong.
 12 MR. ALTER: A few years, Your Honor. I'm -- my
 13 mistake.
 14 As I was saying, if she went and applied for SSI 15 in New Jersey, she would get $583.25 as we sit here right
 16 now. So the difference between the 27 years of work and
 17 no work is, number one, she has a better chance, because
 18 she doesn't have to go through step four; and number two,
 19 she gets another $80. That construction leads to a
 20 disengagement between the worker who's paying the freight
 21 so that the commissioner can have their convenience and
 22 their construction and the actual program. The program
 23 must reflect reality. Disability is a word, but it's a
 24 concept that comes after the commissioner has put in place
 25 a sequential evaluation. And that sequential evaluation

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 is based on the realities of the workplace. It has always
 2 been.
 3 As a matter of fact, may I point one thing out
 4 -- two things actually. Number one, the commissioner
 5 doesn't call it past work. The statute calls it previous
 6 work. The commissioner calls it past relevant work. What
 7 is more irrelevant than a job that doesn't exist? Number
 8 one. 
 9 Number two, the commissioner says that there are
 10 no vocational considerations at step four. We don't care
 11 about whether the job exists or not. But that's not the
 12 case because the commissioner's own ruling states for a
 13 fact that if you can't do your past job as you performed
 14 it, we can still deny you benefits at step four by saying 15 that we -- you can do your past job as it's performed in
 16 the national economy. That's a vocational consideration. 
 17 I never performed that job that way. My job is much
 18 harder. Yes, but when we look into the dictionary of
 19 occupational titles, we find your job and many jobs are
 20 done in a lighter version. You can do that job. But I
 21 never did it before. Vocational considerations.
 22 SSI claimants have more rights and make the same
 23 money as disability claimants. There's something wrong
 24 with that in terms of public policy. 
 25 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Alter.

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ALTER: Thank you. 
 2 QUESTION: Mr. Lamken, you have 19 minutes
 3 remaining. 
 4 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN
 5 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 6 MR. LAMKEN: Thank you. 
 7 First, I wanted to point out that step four in
 8 fact is a measure of severity. The question is how severe
 9 does the impairment have to be, and the statute tells you
 10 exactly how far -- how severe it has to be. It has to be
 11 so severe that the claimant is unable to do his previous
 12 work. So the step four inquiry of previous work is a
 13 measure of severity, and the commissioner has consistently
 14 used that measure of severity to determine whether the 15 individual is functioning at a level that is consistent
 16 with work generally. 
 17 Second, in terms of the deference to which the
 18 commissioner's construction is entitled, this has been the
 19 commissioner's current construction from the outset of the
 20 program, both from before this -- the particular
 21 provisions we've been discussing were adopted in 1967 and
 22 after. We believe that they're clearly reflected in the
 23 commissioner's regulations from 1978, and any -- any
 24 ambiguity in those regulations was cleared up in 1982 with
 25 respect -- by the issuance of SSR 82-40.

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 The commissioner's current regulations, which
 2 became effective September 25th, now make it abundantly
 3 clear and explain in absolutely certain terms that the
 4 commissioner does not consider whether or not the previous
 5 work exists in significant numbers in the national
 6 economy. Because that is the result of a rulemaking,
 7 because it is clearly the commissioner's well-considered
 8 and longstanding interpretation of the statute, it is
 9 entitled to deference.
 10 QUESTION: Those regulations were subject to
 11 notice and comment rulemaking? 
 12 MR. LAMKEN: Yes. In fact, there was a very --
 13 there was a lengthy comment period, and then they went
 14 through the entire process and were issued quite a few 15 years actually after the comment period was completed. 
 16 But yes, those were not -- notice and comment rulemaking,
 17 Justice Ginsburg.
 18 In fact, the clarification came in in response
 19 to a public comment that particular issue wasn't -- was
 20 germane to the rulemaking, but it wasn't one the
 21 commissioner had initially planned to address. But a
 22 commenter said, please clarify that in fact you do
 23 consider whether previous work exists in the national
 24 economy. And the commissioner said, no, no, you've got it
 25 wrong. We do not consider it. Our longstanding view has

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 always been we do not consider whether previous work exits
 2 in substantial numbers in the national economy.
 3 QUESTION: Mr. Lamken --
 4 MR. LAMKEN: Yes. 
 5 QUESTION: -- could you clarify something? I
 6 asked this of -- of Mr. Alter, and I -- I didn't quite
 7 understand his -- his answer. Do you understand the
 8 respondent's position in this case to be anything other
 9 than saying that the statute means it could be abbreviated
 10 to read this way, that he is unable, considering his age,
 11 education, and work experience, to engage in any kind of
 12 substantial, gainful work which subsists in the national
 13 economy? 
 14 MR. LAMKEN: 
 I -- the respondent's position does 15 have the effect of completing the two separate inquiries.
 16 QUESTION: Well, eliminating the first entirely,
 17 does it not eliminate the first entirely?
 18 MR. LAMKEN: The one thing that -- that it
 19 wouldn't take into account is that in the first inquiry,
 20 the commissioner does not take into -- in the previous
 21 work inquiry, the commissioner does not take into account
 22 age, education, and work experience. And your formulation
 23 would make age, education, and work experience relevant to
 24 all work, previous work and past work. However, we
 25 believe that if Congress had intended --

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Well, but -- but if he was doing his
 2 previous work, it is impossible to find that considering
 3 his age, education, and work experience, he couldn't do

 5 MR. LAMKEN: I -- I think that's precisely
 6 right. It makes it -- as a --
 7 QUESTION: It's an impossibility anyway.
 8 MR. LAMKEN: Right. As a structural matter, it
 9 would make it relevant, but in fact it would be rarely, if
 10 ever, a factor the commissioner would use in terms of
 11 denying disability benefits. So it does definitely have
 12 the effect of taking what Congress set out as two separate
 13 conditions precedent and merging them to a degree which
 14 Congress probably did not intend.
 15 Finally, for 45 years in adjudicating more than
 16 40 million claims -- and that includes approximately
 17 200,000 step four, that is, previous work denials a year. 
 18 That's 500 denials a day for every day of every year --
 19 the commissioner has consistently applied this
 20 construction. That construction has functioned well
 21 throughout all these years. Accordingly, we ask the Court
 22 to reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and to
 23 reinstate the commissioner's construction.
 24 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Lamken.
 25 The case is submitted.
