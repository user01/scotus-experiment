3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear argument

4 next in Lockhart versus United States.

5 Mr. Wolfman.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN

7 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8 MR. WOLFMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10 Section 207 of the Social Security Act contains

11 a broad ban on the attachment of Social Security benefits

12 that may be overridden if, in doing so, Congress expressly

13 refers to Section 207. Our basic position is that the

14 effect of an express reference to Section 207 can go no

15 further than the authority that is granted in the statute

16 that includes the express reference. Therefore, here, the

17 Debt Collection Act, the statute that contains that

18 express reference, prohibits offsets to collect claims

19 that have been outstanding for more than 10 years.

20 Therefore, the Government lacks offset authority to

21 collect Mr. Lockhart's older debts.

22 The Debt Collections Act's 10-year bar on the

23 right of the Government to offset debt from governmental

24 payments owing to debtors was enacted in 1982. But, at

25 that time, the Government did not have authority to offset

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Social Security benefits at all. The Government's claim

2 that there's no 10-year bar here relies entirely on a

3 provision of the Higher Education technical amendments

4 that overrode statutes of limitations for collecting

5 student debts. But that was passed in 1991, 5 years

6 before the -- before -- the Government had authority to

7 offset Social Security benefits at all. That authority,

8 as I've referred to, came only in 1996, in the Debt

9 Collection Improvement Act, which did expressly refer to

10 the Social Security Act's anti-attachment provision. But

11 --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did -- are -- just as an

13 initial matter, are you sure that one Congress can bind a

14 future Congress that way, that Congress can pass a law

15 that says, you know, "In the future, no statute shall have

16 X effect unless it says" -- and then it writes in a phrase

17 that has to be said?

18 MR. WOLFMAN: Well --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: And then you have a future

20 Congress that makes its intent entirely clear in a statute

21 that does not use the magic words. I thought our cases

22 held that, in such a situation, the will of the future

23 Congress prevails --

24 MR. WOLFMAN: That --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- so long as it's clearly

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 expressed.

2 MR. WOLFMAN: I will say that that is something

3 that we've considered. It's not briefed here, but I think

4 the issue is not presented here. And here's why: because

5 in -- what occurred in 1996 comported with the express-

6 reference requirement. The problem here is that -- so, it

7 said that they can offset Social Security benefits. But

8 it is contained in a statute that includes the 10-year

9 bar. So, even if the anti-attachment provision did not

10 exclude the express-reference provision, it still --

11 whatever allowed the attachment has to be, in our view,

12 coincident with the statute in which the express reference

13 --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: It didn't contain the bar at

15 the time that they said, "You can collect it." In the

16 later statute, which said, "You now can collect out of

17 Social Security," when they passed that, did it contain a

18 10-year bar?

19 MR. WOLFMAN: Yes, it did.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought the Higher Education

21 Act said -- as of what year did the Higher Education Act

22 say, "No statute of limitations applies to us"?

23 MR. WOLFMAN: That was 1991.

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. In --

25 MR. WOLFMAN: Yes.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- 1991, it said, "No statute

2 of limitations applies to us." Then, in what year did the

3 statute -- was passed which said, "And you can collect

4 money out of Social Security payments for higher

5 education"?

6 MR. WOLFMAN: That occurred in 1996. But, as I

7 --

8 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Why isn't that the

9 end of it? So --

10 MR. WOLFMAN: The reason that's --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: -- so there was no -- there was

12 no statute of limitations applying to the Social Security

13 Act; and then, in 1996, they say, "And now go get them."

14 MR. WOLFMAN: Because --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: What can we do about that?

16 MR. WOLFMAN: Because, with respect, that's not

17 what Congress said in 1996.

18 JUSTICE BREYER: What did they say?

19 MR. WOLFMAN: They didn't say, "Go get them."

20 What they did is, as an amendment to the Debt Collection

21 Act, in the Debt Collection Improvement Act, they inserted

22 permission to go -- to offset Social Security benefits in

23 a statute that has a 10-year bar. So --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: It has a 10-year bar. But the

25 earlier 1991 Act says, "That doesn't apply to us."

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. WOLFMAN: Yes, but -- but, again, getting

2 back -- and I think this takes us back to Justice Scalia's

3 question -- that -- the -- there is a broad anti-

4 attachment provision. There is an express-reference

5 requirement. Our view is that the -- that -- those

6 requirements can go no -- the abrogation of the -- of the

7 bar to offset Social Security benefits, or to attach

8 Social Security benefits in any way, can go no further

9 than the statute in which that abrogation occurs. And

10 this statute has a 10-year bar.

11 So, if I can explain further, the Debt

12 Collection Improvement Act, and the Debt Collection Act

13 before it, has a 10-year bar. It's not merely a statute

14 of limitations. It says that the Government has no

15 authority to offset after the 10-year period, after the

16 claim has been outstanding for more than 10 years. That's

17 the statute that includes the abrogation of the offset of

18 Social Security benefits.

19 JUSTICE BREYER: So, in other words, you're

20 saying that that provision of the later statute that says,

21 "Go get them on Social Security," implicitly reads into it

22 the 10-year bar that's in a different part of the statute.

23 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, I --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: So, it's as if it said, "Go get

25 them on Social Security, under 407, which is gone now, but

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 only for 10 years."

2 MR. WOLFMAN: Well --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that what your -- I'm trying

4 to understand this.

5 MR. WOLFMAN: That is our argument.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

7 MR. WOLFMAN: That is our argument.

8 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

9 MR. WOLFMAN: But I would only qualify it --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: The only problem is, it

11 doesn't say that.

12 MR. WOLFMAN: No, I would disagree, Your Honor.

13 I would say that my only quarrel with your question is

14 that it's not implicit, it is explicit. The statute --

15 the Debt Collection Improvement Act, as the Debt

16 Collection Act before it, contains a 10-year bar on the

17 authority of the Government to offset. This is not a mere

18 statute-of-limitations defense that can be waived. This

19 is a complete lack of authority to the -- in the

20 Government to offset. That's --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are --

22 MR. WOLFMAN: -- the statute --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying that this has a

24 purpose other than barring stable -- stale claims? It's

25 simply designed to limit the offset provisions in order to

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 allow other Federal programs to proceed and -- I'm looking

2 for some way for you to describe (e) as being something

3 other than a limitations provision.

4 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, what it says --

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because I think that would help

6 you.

7 MR. WOLFMAN: Yes, and I think -- that's exactly

8 my point. What (e) says is that this Act does not apply

9 -- and I'm quoting now -- "This Act does not apply when

10 the claim has been outstanding for more than 10 years."

11 That strikes us -- you can call it "limitations" if you

12 want, but it strikes us as a very powerful one. Because

13 it restricts the Government's ability to bring such a case

14 --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if --

16 MR. WOLFMAN: -- for offset.

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- if we call it

18 "limitations," you have a much harder case, because of the

19 1991 Act.

20 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, I -- with respect, I don't

21 think that the actual nomenclature matters that much, but

22 I will distinguish it from what the law normally calls a

23 limitations period, because a limitations period is one

24 that is raised as an affirmative defense and may be

25 waived. This provision, where it says, "This Act does not

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 apply" --

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --

3 MR. WOLFMAN: -- does not apply.

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- can you give me a reason

5 for the Government's adopting (e), the 10-year -- the 10-

6 year bar, other than for stale claims or --

7 MR. WOLFMAN: Oh, I don't know that there is

8 one, but my point, again, is simply that the Government

9 has no authority to proceed. So, then we look -- we look

10 at that statute, and we say, "What did the -- what did the

11 Congress do in 1996?" What the Congress did in 1996 was

12 amend that very statute by saying, "Within the confines of

13 this statute, you may now offset."

14 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, but that's --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand that, but I'm

16 just -- I'm just saying, if you could give me an

17 explanation, a characterization, a description, a

18 statement of purpose that's other than the bar on stale

19 claims, I think you'd have a stronger case. But it seems

20 to me just like a stale-claims statute, so I go back and

21 look for other limitations period, and I find it in

22 1091(a).

23 MR. WOLFMAN: You know, again, if -- it is not

24 -- the purposes of the bar are not stated in any of the

25 legislative materials, and we can assume that at least one

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of the principal purposes was to not allow the litigation,

2 the contesting of stale claims, or to give the individuals

3 repose, which is a purpose of time bars.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: You can call it any purpose you

5 want, but there is an earlier word in 9- -- 1091(a), just

6 what Justice Kennedy said. The earlier word says

7 limitations don't apply to the higher-education debt. And

8 so, if this later statute, the words you're talking about,

9 the words of "10 years," the words that limit when you can

10 do it, if those words, which are in subsection (e), are a

11 "limitation," then I guess the earlier statute says they

12 don't apply to the higher-education debt. And so, I don't

13 see how you get out of that. I mean -- I mean, this is a

14 rather harsh result. I understand why you'd like to get

15 out of it. But I don't understand how we do get out of

16 it.

17 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, I think there are -- there

18 are -- I -- there are several answers. And, if I might,

19 first of all, if you must characterize what -- and we are

20 happy to do so -- was in the 1996 Act as either a time

21 bar or a limitations period, this is clearly the former,

22 because this -- because the limitations periods in the law

23 are ones which have to be raised by affirmative defense.

24 For instance, the Rules of Civil Procedure say limitations

25 periods are raised by affirmative defense, and the case

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 law is unanimous that they can be waived. That is not

2 what this provision does. This provision restricts the

3 authority, in the first instance, for the Government to

4 bring the case.

5 The second thing I would say, though, Your Honor

6 -- and I think it does not matter, ultimately -- that can

7 be our principal submission here, and it is, but it does

8 not matter -- I think, ultimately, the nomenclature

9 doesn't matter, because -- again, because the Act

10 restricts the authority of the Government to bring a case

11 that is beyond the 10-year period. And that is the

12 statute that contains the express reference. That is the

13 --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, part of the problem

15 is that 1091(a)(2), the "notwithstanding" clause, talks

16 also specifically about offsets, which is what this is, I

17 take it.

18 MR. WOLFMAN: No, I understand that, Your Honor.

19 I mean --

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, if it had said "no" --

21 MR. WOLFMAN: -- I understand that.

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- "no limitations period,"

23 then I might -- this specifically talks about an offset.

24 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, that's right. The -- and I

25 -- I don't think that undercuts our argument at all,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 because, after all, there's no question that, prior to

2 1996, there was offset authority in the Government to

3 offset -- to collect debt against other types of income,

4 other than Social Security. So, I don't think that

5 undercuts our argument at all.

6 But let me, if I might, go back to your question

7 one more time, because I think there's yet a third answer,

8 which is -- which is the chronological answer that -- made

9 in our briefs that, in 1991, the Congress could not have

10 had the intent to get at Social Security benefits at all,

11 because, of course, there -- and it's -- this point is

12 conceded -- the Government had no authority whatsoever to

13 offset Social Security benefits.

14 If I might, in the -- let me go --

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I pursue that point for a

16 second --

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- more? I -- it seems to me

18 that you would have a much stronger argument on that point

19 if, in 1996, the Act provided that, suddenly, Social

20 Security benefits -- some Social Security benefits would

21 be -- would be subject to administrative offset, but only

22 those when the Government -- imposed when the Government

23 is trying to collect educational loans. We would then

24 have what seems to -- would seem to me to be a really

25 head-to-head conflict between the two statutes. The

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 trouble is that, in 1996, the extension of the

2 administrative setoff authority covered Social Security

3 benefits to be -- for which there would be a setoff for

4 any purpose -- not just educational loans; for any

5 purpose. So that, in fact, it is possible for us to read

6 the 1996 Act as having an effect -- there's a 10-year

7 limit, generally -- at the same time that we read the

8 earlier -- I forget what the -- '91, I guess it is --

9 MR. WOLFMAN: The HETA law, yes.

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- which says, with respect to

11 educational loan collections, including by setoff, there's

12 no limitation at all. So, we can have both statutes

13 without rendering either one of them nugatory. And isn't

14 that the preferred way to read statutes?

15 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, but I -- but I -- with all

16 respect, I think our interpretation certainly does not

17 render HETA nugatory, because HETA would still override

18 limitations periods for other forms of collection with

19 respect to other types --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: But with --

21 MR. WOLFMAN: of debts.

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- with respect to Social

23 Security setoffs, of course, it would.

24 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, it -- I'm not sure I

25 understand that question.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Social Security -- Social

2 Security said it would be -- it would be a -- it would --

3 a flat head-to-head contradiction, no matter how you read

4 it, on Social Security setoffs for educational loans.

5 MR. WOLFMAN: Well --

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if that's the only thing

7 that the 1996 Act covered, we would say, "Boy, there is

8 just an absolute conflict here. We can't have both

9 statutes." But, in fact, we can have both statutes most of

10 the time. We read the 1996 10-year limitation as covering

11 everything except setoffs against Social Security for

12 educational loans. And, with respect to the educational

13 loans, we give respect to the -- to the earlier decision

14 that there be no limitation at all. You just have a

15 weaker argument than you would have if the 1996 Act only

16 covered this case.

17 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, that may be, but let me,

18 again, if I -- if I might, respond to that -- to this --

19 to this point, because I think it is true that the

20 proportion of times under our argument that the 10-year

21 bar would apply would -- is greater under our position,

22 but it is, nevertheless, true that HETA still applies to

23 many situations, under our reading, and the 10-year bar

24 applies to somewhat more. But let me -- I think there's

25 another answer to your point, which is, it still does not

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 undercut our basic submission that the Congress could not

2 have formed this specific intent. And it's very unlike

3 the -- the intent being to get to the Government the --

4 the result it seeks here. And the reason for that is --

5 is, they could not have focused on this problem, because

6 in -- it wasn't for another 5 years that Social Security

7 was even on the radar screen at all. And this brings me

8 back, I think, to Justice Breyer's --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but --

10 MR. WOLFMAN: -- initial question.

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- may I ask this question?

12 That's a very -- that's a very interesting statutory

13 construction case, I must say, by the way. But the -- in

14 1996, when they made the offset available against Social

15 Security payments, they didn't enact a 10-year statute of

16 limitations; they changed subsection, I think, (b) to (d)

17 and said the 10-year provision is retained. And when the

18 10-year provision was first put in -- I mean, when the

19 exception for student loans was made, in 1991, you had a

20 statute that had a 10-year period for everything except

21 student loan recovery. And it seems to me that if you

22 look at the 1996 statute as saying, "We're going to allow

23 offsets against Social Security," under the same scheme

24 that was enacted in 1991, because we had just amended the

25 10-year provision to preserve it -- they preserved the 10-

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 year provision -- that they seem to me to be preserving it

2 in a statute that made this distinction between student

3 loans and all other offsets. Is --

4 MR. WOLFMAN: I --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: It isn't as though they

6 enacted, for the first time, an authority to offset Social

7 Security and, in that statute, said, "And -- but, by the

8 way, there's a 10-year period of limitations here."

9 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, that --

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Rather, they amended the 1991

11 Act.

12 MR. WOLFMAN: -- that is correct. And I think

13 that -- but with a caveat, which I'll get to -- but -- I

14 think that is correct, but it is a -- it is a consequence

15 of the situation that Congress found itself in, in 1996.

16 In other words, it already had a statute, the offset

17 statute, which had a 10-year bar. And so --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it also had the exception

19 for student loans. It's -- it was --

20 MR. WOLFMAN: Well --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- side by side with the rest

22 of the 10-year bar.

23 MR. WOLFMAN: I'm not sure what you mean in that

24 -- I'm not sure what you mean by the exception for student

25 loans. There --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it's 1091(a).

2 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, 1091 was in a different

3 statutory provision, in a different part of the code. But

4 yes, what I'm saying is, they --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it was in the 1991

6 statute.

7 MR. WOLFMAN: Right. It was in a 1991 statute

8 that was a freestanding statute that dealt with Social

9 Security benefits, generally. Then what you had in 1996

10 was a focus on offsets, specifically, and on Social

11 Security, specifically. And the only point --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the '91 Act mentions

13 offsets, specifically, as well.

14 MR. WOLFMAN: That's right. And -- but it

15 mentions a lot of -- many meanings of "collection," that

16 is correct. And -- but I think it's not quite fair to say

17 that they merely reenacted the 10-year bar. We think

18 that's sufficient for us to prevail. But, you know, the

19 Congress, in 1996, did a pretty comprehensive overall --

20 overhaul of the Debt Collection Act. It appears to have

21 gone through every section. It strengthened some of the

22 notice provisions. It focused specifically on Social

23 Security and said that you can now offset them by making

24 the express reference. And then it turned to -- what had

25 been subsection (c) then became subsection (e). It

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 amended one of the paragraphs, but retained the paragraph

2 that has the 10-year bar. So, I think it's fair to say

3 that Congress looked at all the sections carefully. Now

4 --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: If you say that -- let me just

6 throw this thought out, so you can comment on it.

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that there is a

8 reasonable basis for assuming Congress might have thought

9 that student loans should not have a 10-year bar if you're

10 going to collect from Social Security, because most Social

11 Security payments won't accrue until many, many years --

12 much more than 10 years after the student-loan default.

13 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, that -- the Government

14 certainly makes that submission in its brief, but, as we

15 note in our reply brief, the statistics the Government

16 cites don't really back that up. I -- but we do -- we do

17 acknowledge that, with respect to Social Security

18 retirement benefits, there will be many people who are

19 beyond the 10-year bar. With respect to people who get

20 other sorts of Social Security benefits, that's not clear

21 at all, actually. There are survivors --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but there is a --

23 MR. WOLFMAN: -- and there are disability --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Retirement benefits are a

25 pretty big part --

1 MR. WOLFMAN: Are a --


2 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- of the whole package. 


3 MR. WOLFMAN: -- larger number, that is true. 


4 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 


5 MR. WOLFMAN: But, again, I don't think that --


6 there's no -- there's no suggestion in -- the problem --

7 the ultimate problem with that point for the Government,

8 Justice Stevens, is that it requires us to believe that

9 Congress formed that intent in 1991, which is an

10 impossibility, because --

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I understand that.

12 MR. WOLFMAN: -- in 1991, Social Security

13 benefits were just, sort of, off the table. They weren't

14 on the radar screen at all. And that's the ultimate

15 problem with the Government's --

16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. --


17 MR. WOLFMAN: -- theory there. 


18 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- Wolfman, are there 


19 provisions by regulation in the Department of Education

20 for discharge of debts like this on a showing of total and

21 permanent disability?

22 MR. WOLFMAN: There are, Your Honor.

23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And your client doesn't

24 qualify, or --

25 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, the record is completely

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 silent on that question. I don't know the answer to that.

2 He was certainly disabled. I will only point out that

3 the standards for total and permanent disability under the

4 Department of Education regs are much more stringent than

5 those for Social Security, because that only requires a

6 12-month period of disability. But I don't know the

7 answer as to him.

8 I do want to get to one other point

9 before I sit down, and -- which is to address one of the

10 Government's arguments -- is that to -- to get around a --

11 the problem that the DCIA reenacted the 10-year bar, the

12 Government relies on the "notwithstanding" clause of the

13 1991 Education Act, arguing that it wipes away any time

14 bar, regardless of when the time bar was enacted, and no

15 matter what type of collection is at issue. But, as we

16 note in our reply brief extensively, those

17 "notwithstanding" clauses are not as all-powerful as the

18 Government suggests they are. And what the case law --

19 the lower-court case law suggests is that you need to

20 look, as we have done in our submission, at the

21 legislative history and the legislative motive surrounding

22 both Acts, the previous Act and the subsequent Act. And,

23 here, what you have -- and I don't want to beat a dead

24 horse, but I will repeat once again that the problem here

25 is -- for the Government -- is that we have this very

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 powerful anti-attachment provision with its express-

2 reference requirement. And the only place in these

3 statutory materials where the express reference occurs is

4 in a -- the very Act that includes the 10-year bar. And

5 to accept the Government's argument, you would have to

6 accept the notion that the -- an express reference in an

7 act can go beyond the authority that's granted by that

8 very act.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: No, it -- I mean, you -- it's

10 -- it probably comes up a lot. You have -- you have the

11 earlier act that imposes -- suppose you have some --

12 Endangered Species Act and -- at an earlier time -- and it

13 says all provisions of a certain kind will have this

14 effect in respect to endangered species. And then you

15 have some laters act -- later acts. And, in those later

16 acts, there are certain things about how to treat certain

17 animals and so forth. And the question would be, "Well,

18 does that earlier thing, telling you how to treat an

19 endangered species, apply now to the animals in this later

20 act insofar as they're endangered?" And the answer would

21 be, "Of course it does" --

22 MR. WOLFMAN: Yes.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: -- unless there's some special

24 reason --

25 MR. WOLFMAN: Right.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- for thinking that it

2 doesn't.  And so, what's the special reason --

3 MR. WOLFMAN: Well --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: -- here? You have an earlier

5 act that says, when you see those words, "10-year

6 limitations," forget them where student loans in effect.

7 Now we have a later act, and it has the word "10-year

8 limitations," and you're giving some reasons why --

9 MR. WOLFMAN: Right.

10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- it is special and --

11 MR. WOLFMAN: Right.

12 JUSTICE BREYER: -- so forth. And --

13 MR. WOLFMAN: And I --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I don't know --

15 MR. WOLFMAN: -- but I --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: -- if they're --

17 MR. WOLFMAN: -- but I think that that's --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: -- strong enough --

19 MR. WOLFMAN: -- that's the nub of the case --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh. Yes, that is the nub.

21 MR. WOLFMAN: -- the special reasons. But --

22 but I -- but I -- let me -- let me -- let me answer your

23 question --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, they don't have

25 that big burden to show. They have to just --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. WOLFMAN: I --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: -- show it's normal.

3 MR. WOLFMAN: That's where I --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: And you have to show it's

5 special.

6 MR. WOLFMAN: I think, on these legislative

7 materials, they have quite a burden. And let me explain

8 why. Your -- the -- Justice Breyer, the hypothetical you

9 posit is one with which I can agree. We are not saying --

10 I don't want to be mistaken -- that -- we are not saying

11 that previous legislation can't have effect on future

12 events, or even future legislation. We're not saying that

13 all. But the nub of our argument is this express-

14 reference requirement, and I think it's -- it seems very,

15 very odd to us that when you have a statute that has an --

16 where the express reference appears, and that has a 10-

17 year bar on the authority --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. --

19 MR. WOLFMAN: -- to collect --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- Wolfman, couldn't you say

21 the question could be phrased in this way? Do we view the

22 notwithstanding language in 1091(a) as enacted in 1091 and

23 governing the future, or do we view the 1996 amendment as,

24 in effect, an amendment to that stat which -- which

25 reenacted the provisions that were already there? And if

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it's a reenactment in 1996, then it's just an exception

2 from the 10-year bar.

3 MR. WOLFMAN: Right. I think that -- that is a

4 fair characterization of one our arguments here --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

6 MR. WOLFMAN: -- which -- one of our arguments

7 here is, given the various indicia of intent, both in '91

8 and '96, that the '96 Act, with respect to a small sliver

9 of collections, is effectively an amendment of the '91

10 Act. However, that is not our only, or even our principal

11 submission. Our principal submission has to do with the

12 powerful anti-attachment --

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

14 MR. WOLFMAN: -- provision.

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand.

16 MR. WOLFMAN: Okay? And, again, the

17 Government's position -- and I will rest after this,

18 because I've repeated this already -- but the -- the

19 Government's position is, in effect, that you can use the

20 anti-attachment position in the express-reference

21 requirement in a statute to allow authority beyond that

22 very statute. And we submit that that is -- that is not

23 permissible under section 407.

24 Unless the Court has further questions, I'll

25 reserve the rest of my time.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Wolfman.

2 Ms. Blatt.

3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

4 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

5 MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

6 may it please the Court:

7 In sweeping and unqualified language, the Higher

8 Education Act provides that, notwithstanding any other

9 provision of law, no limitations as to time shall apply to

10 the collection of student-loan debt by offset. Therefore,

11 notwithstanding the general 10-year limit that applies to

12 the offset of all Federal payments, including Social

13 Security payments, no time limit applies.

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it didn't include Social

15 Security payments when it was enacted.

16 MS. BLATT: That's right. In 1982, Congress

17 authorized --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Or 1991. Either one.

19 MS. BLATT: Right. In 1982, Federal payments

20 were subject to offsets such as Federal grants or

21 contracts or pension. And, in 1991, Congress passed a law

22 that said there's no -- going to be no time limit for the

23 Government to collect student-loan debt by offset.

24 Therefore, there has always been a student-loan exception

25 to the Government's ability to offset for only up to 10

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 years. So, we can't offset Federal pension payments or

2 contract payments beyond 10 years unless it's for student

3 loans.

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but then -- but then, in

5 -- you know, you know what's coming. You -- the provision

6 you rely on is 3116, and it's stuck into the middle of

7 this -- of a provision which requires written notice,

8 opportunity to inspect records, and so forth. All those

9 apply. But you have to say that (e) doesn't apply.

10 MS. BLATT: Well, (e) is a limitations period,

11 and it is a provision of law, and the Higher Education Act

12 says, notwithstanding any other provision of law, there's

13 no time limit for offsetting -- for collection by offset

14 when it's to collect student-loan debt. What happened in

15 1996 is, Congress authorized Social Security benefits as

16 another source of Federal payment. But it's critical to

17 understand that Congress left completely undisturbed and

18 intact that pre-existing 10-year limit and the pre-

19 existing student-loan exception --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mr. Wolfman tells us, Ms.

21 Blatt, that this clause is not quite as sweeping as you

22 suggest, the clause in the 1991 Act, and points

23 specifically to provisions that say, "no other provision

24 of law enacted before, on, or after." The picture we're

25 given of the 1991 Act is that up until 1991, whatever

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 exists up until 1991, there's no time limitation, but that

2 this 1991 statute does not speak to subsequently enacted

3 statutes.

4 MS. BLATT: Yes, well, it is unqualified, on its

5 face, Justice Ginsburg. It doesn't say "notwithstanding

6 any other provision of existing law." It says "any law."

7 And it would be a rather bizarre and novel statute if

8 Congress had to keep amending every time Congress

9 redesignated a limitation provision, which is all that's

10 happened here. Every time Congress had a limitation

11 provision that changed from subsection (e) to (a), or was

12 given a different section number, Congress would have to

13 go back and say -- I guess, reenact the Higher Education

14 Act every time it amended the statute of limitations.

15 But, even if you think that it only applied to pre-

16 existing limitations period, this 10-year limit predated

17 the Higher Education Act. It was passed in 1982, and had

18 -- and has appeared in identical language since 1983.

19 Nothing happened in 1996 to statutes of limitations. All

20 that happened was that Congress, in essence, put Social

21 Security benefits on par, equal footing, with all other

22 Federal payments.

23 And let me just say, imposing a 10-year limit

24 would largely nullify Social Security offsets to collect

25 student-loan debt.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The point that Justice

2 Stevens made --

3 MS. BLATT: Yes.

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- before.

5 MS. BLATT: Ninety percent of all student-loan

6 debtors who default do so before age 55. And, therefore,

7 a 10-year time limit will have expired before the debtor

8 reaches full retirement age, at age 65. And it's relevant

9 not so much what Congress what was thinking in '91, but

10 it's relevant for what Congress was thinking in 1996. In

11 1996, Congress made Social Security benefits subject to

12 offset. And it's completely rational to think that

13 Congress of course understood there would be a general 10-

14 year limit that's always been applied to offsets of all

15 Federal payments, including the Federal contract payments

16 or pension payments, and now Social Security payments,

17 but, yes, there's another provision of the U.S. code that

18 contains an express and, we think, extraordinary

19 exception. It says time limits are intolerable when it

20 comes to the collection of student-loan debt.

21 Now, at the same time, Social Security

22 recipients are protected from any undue burden. The -- if

23 you are disabled under the Department's regulations, you

24 can obtain a complete discharge, a total walk-away-from-

25 the-debt-forever, if you have a disability that prevents

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you from earning income. You also -- the amount of the

2 Social Security offset is limited to the lesser of 15

3 percent of the benefit payment or the amount by which the

4 benefit payment exceeds $750. And any debtor can enter

5 into a repayment agreement that will take their total --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those are -- those are

7 regulatory provisions, right?

8 MS. BLATT: The caps, Mr. Chief Justice, are in

9 the statute, and further limited by the regulations. But,

10 actually, the repayment agreements are mandated provisions

11 under the Higher Education Act. It mandates the Secretary

12 of Education to allow debtors to enter in repayment

13 agreements that are contingent on their income, and that

14 will allow them to repay their debt under reasonable and

15 affordable terms. That's also in the statute.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: So, is the statute -- I saw

17 something here, that a person who's going to get this

18 offset, and he has Social Security, you exempt $9,000 of

19 the Social Security, and then you limit it to 15 percent

20 of the remainder or whatever is reasonable, whichever is

21 less.

22 MS. BLATT: It's the lesser of -- it's the

23 lesser of the 15 percent or the amount by which the

24 benefit payment exceeds 750. So, in this case, when the

25 original Social Security check was, I think, like, $874,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 15 percent would have been a higher number. You have to

2 leave the recipient with 750, so I think only $94 was

3 taken out. And I may have my math a little off. But you

4 -- the -- you give the recipient the benefit.

5 Now, the only thing that's in the regulations,

6 Mr. Chief Justice, are the disability, that that is just a

7 -- it's a walkaway on the loan. Even if you win the

8 lottery the next day, if you can show that you can't work

9 because of a disability, the Secretary of Education will

10 discharge your loan.

11 Now, the principal argument on the other side is

12 section 207 of the Social Security Act. Now, that statute

13 requires an explicit reference before Social Security

14 benefits can be subject to a legal process. But it

15 doesn't require an explicit reference when the only

16 question is the statute of limitations that are applicable

17 to a legal process that is already otherwise expressly

18 authorized. The Debt Collection Act is the actual statute

19 that authorizes the offset of Social Security benefits.

20 The Higher Education Act just lifts limitations periods

21 when there's another statute that establishes a collection

22 mechanism. And the Debt Collection Act contains the

23 express reference. It provides, in 3716, that, "We're

24 making our clear statement, we want Social Security

25 benefits to be subject to offset." And, like I said, it

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 just -- it plugged the Social Security system into this

2 pre-existing --

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it is -- it is true that

4 the 1996 statute, which is the first time the express

5 reference appears, does contain the 10-year statute by the

6 indirect reference, and does not expressly refer to the --

7 cite the 1091(a).

8 MS. BLATT: That's right. It makes the express

9 reference to 207, and it has this general limitations

10 period that applies to all offsets. But, Justice Stevens,

11 just --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it says -- and it says

13 "offsets under this section."

14 MS. BLATT: That's right. And that takes you

15 down to the subsection (e), which imposes a 10-year limit.

16 But just as today Congress certainly is free to say,

17 "From now on, Social Security benefits and all offsets

18 will be subject to an 11-year limitations period," it

19 doesn't have to expressly reference 207 to amend the Debt

20 Collection Act. The Debt Collection Act is what's being,

21 in effect, amended or an exception. And the Debt

22 Collection Act doesn't contain its own express-reference

23 requirement before it can be amended. Congress didn't

24 say, "We're forever binding ourselves," or, "We want some

25 different canon of interpretation here." And so, you have

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 a very extraordinary provision in the Higher Education Act

2 that says, "Notwithstanding any other provision of law,

3 there's not going to be a time limit to offset in order to

4 collect student loan" --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: But -- yeah, I think he's --

6 one argument that they're emphasizing, anyway, is that --

7 you look at the Debt Collection Act, and suppose it had

8 said the following, "Section 207 is amended, or changed,

9 as follows. We refer specially now -- we can collect,

10 through offset, but only for 10 years. I mean, only to

11 claims that are more than 10 years old. So, we are

12 changing what 207 says for debts over 10 year -- under 10

13 years old, and we can offset those." Now, suppose it had

14 said that.

15 MS. BLATT: It would still -- the express

16 reference would be completely overtaken, because it says

17 the "notwithstanding section 207." It would authorize

18 offset for --

19 JUSTICE BREYER: And you'd say it's the same.

20 MS. BLATT: For up to 10 years.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If that's the same,

22 let's imagine this statute. The statute says, "We bestow

23 upon the Social Security agency a very limited power."

24 And it says, "This is the limited power. The Social

25 Security Agency may, despite 207, levy offsets on under-

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 10-year-old debts." That's what they say, right in the

2 Act.

3 MS. BLATT: Right. It would -- the --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: And then, indeed, the whole

5 point of it -- it's entitled "Limited Offset Ability,"

6 parenthesis -- "Limited Offset Ability (Extending Only to

7 Debts of Less than Ten Years)," end parenthesis. That's

8 the title of the Act, and then it says just what I say,

9 repeating that.

10 MS. BLATT: Yes. Well, our position is that the

11 Social Security Act only requires an express reference to

12 create authorization to offset.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: But you're not going to treat

14 that --

15 MS. BLATT: And --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: -- one the same. You see, what

17 they're saying here is -- they want to say that what I've

18 just said is what Congress wrote in this Act. And --

19 MS. BLATT: Right.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I'm making it harder and

21 harder for you to accept that saying --

22 MS. BLATT: Yes. Well, our --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: -- automatically.

24 MS. BLATT: -- fundamental position --

25 -- I'll be clear on this -- is that

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the Higher Education Act applies unless it's been

2 repealed. And there's just nothing in the Higher

3 Education Act that comes close to repealing -- in, excuse

4 me, the Debt Collection Act -- that comes close to

5 repealing the Higher Education Act, because it doesn't

6 address the subject of student loans. It just speaks to

7 the ability to offset Social Security benefits, as well as

8 all other Federal payments that have been subject to

9 offset.

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Blatt, can I ask --

11 there's no discussion -- legislative history in the briefs

12 that I -- because I -- that I recall. Is it true that the

13 people voting on the bill in 1996 had nothing but the

14 amendment before them? Did they have a committee report

15 on it explaining that it still applied to the -- that the

16 -- that the "notwithstanding" clause in 1091(a) would

17 still be in effect?

18 MS. BLATT: No, I know of no statement to that

19 effect. But I know of no statement -- any discussion

20 about limitations period. There's no discussion of the

21 10-year limit either.

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because it seems to me that,

23 conceivably, a legislator looking at the bill all by

24 itself, not getting out the earlier provisions of the

25 code, might well think, "Well, this includes a 10-year

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 limit."

2 MS. BLATT: Maybe they did, maybe they didn't.

3 Maybe the knew that a court would actually apply the U.S.

4 code, as written --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

6 MS. BLATT: -- and just because it -- the

7 limitation period was in one section -- but, now, here's

8 where I think the policy does come into play. A

9 legislature would think that a 10-year limit would never

10 come in to offset Social Security benefits on student

11 loan, except in a rare case of an old debtor who -- and

12 also defaults close in time to age 65. And, like I said,

13 90 percent of all the student-loan defaults are by debtors

14 who are under age 55, and over -- about 83 or 84 percent

15 of all Social Security payments are under the retirement

16 system, not the disability system. And if a person is

17 disabled, there's no reason to think that they can't get a

18 discharge of that loan.

19 So, all we're talking about is basically

20 rendering a dead letter Social Security offsets to collect

21 student-loan debt, if Petitioner's position were to

22 prevail.

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why can he get a discharge if

24 he's disabled?

25 MS. BLATT: You can get a discharge of your loan

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 if you have a disability of indefinite duration that

2 prevents you from working. The rationale is, sort of, a

3 changed-circumstances rationale. If you took out a loan,

4 you signed a promissory note, you intend to pay it back.

5 But if you later become disabled, and that disability is

6 going to prevent you from ever working, they'll discharge

7 it. Now, about 30 percent of all people who do apply for

8 this disability discharge do get it, and about 80 percent

9 get a conditional discharge, what gives them -- it gives

10 them a 3-year grace period. And the only difference

11 between -- I mean, there are some small differences, but

12 the main difference between a Social Security disability

13 determination and an Education Department disability

14 determination is the Department of Education wants you to

15 be disabled of an indefinite duration, and not just 12

16 months, because it's a complete and total walkaway from

17 the loan. And Social Security will actually do a lookback

18 after 12 months. But Education will never go back and ask

19 for the money. Once they've discharged it, it's a

20 permanent discharge.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Blatt, it -- was this

22 statute -- I'm just really kind of curious that something

23 this important, we're first putting this burden on Social

24 Security -- it's a fairly important change. Was this part

25 of one of these omnibus bills that covered 99 different

1 subjects at once?

2 MS. BLATT: Yes. I --

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: That --

4 MS. BLATT: -- I remember trying to find it on

5 Westlaw. It's, like, 3,000 pages. It's --

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

7 MS. BLATT: -- huge. And it covers many, many

8 different subjects.

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: And they did not have a

10 separate committee proceeding on each separate part of

11 that monster bill --

12 MS. BLATT: That --

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- as I remember.

14 MS. BLATT: That, I don't recall. But I can say

15 the overall thrust -- and it's in their statement of

16 purpose -- was to improve the Government's debt-collection

17 --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

19 MS. BLATT: -- efforts. And what it did was,

20 for the first time -- and this was a very significant

21 development -- establish a centralized offset. Before

22 1996, there was no ability to cross-check a debt from one

23 agency to a payment to --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

25 MS. BLATT: -- another agency, such that one

1 Department had no idea what another Department was doing.

2 And now it is a massive program involving over $1

3 trillion of Federal payables, $255 billion of certified

4 debt, and 33 billion of that is education loan debt. And

5 so, that -- this was to -- an enormous undertaking to

6 start that, in 1996. And one of the things that Congress

7 did in setting up this massive program was, made Social

8 Security benefits part of the offset program. There's

9 about $480 or $490 billion in Social Security benefits,

10 so -- which -- it was a huge source of revenue, although

11 Congress obviously limited it substantially with the caveat.

12 And if there are no further questions, we would

13 ask that the Court of Appeals judgment be affirmed.

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Blatt.

15 Mr. Wolfman, you have three and a half minutes

16 remaining.

17 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN

18 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

19 MR. WOLFMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

20 I want to address, first, a point that the

21 Government makes, that -- and it's about Section 207 of

22 the Social Security Act, the anti-attachment provision.

23 Opposing counsel says that it doesn't really matter that

24 the 10-year bar was not addressed in 1996, because all

25 that's necessary under the express-reference provision is

1 to refer to the law, in general, that it doesn't apply to

2 limitations periods. But that simply cannot be the case

3 here, because, again, this statute that we are talking

4 about, the Debt Collection Improvement Act, and the Debt

5 Collection Act before, is a bar on the authority of the

6 Government to collect after 10 years.

7 And let me pick up on the language that Justice

8 Kennedy pointed to from the Debt Collection Act. It says,

9 in the very subsection in which Social Security first was

10 put on the radar screen, was first dealt with,

11 (c)(3)(a)(i) -- it says that you can now go after Social

12 Security benefits, because they are subject to offset

13 under this section, meaning 3716. Then, if you turn to

14 another subsection of that section, it says -- and this is

15 the 10-year bar -- this section, quote, "does not apply,"

16 end quote, to a claim under this subchapter that has been

17 outstanding for more than 10 years.

18 Now, I don't see any reason to say that 207, the

19 requirement of an express reference, is, sort of, a

20 halfway requirement. In other words, "You only have to

21 refer to Social Security benefits. We don't care what the

22 extent of that authority is in the very section that you

23 use that express reference." Here, the entire authority

24 is circumscribed by the 10-year bar. That is our

25 essential submission.

1 I have one other point, which is that the --

2 because there was a number of questions on it. We think

3 it doesn't go to the congressional intent here, but I do

4 want to clarify. There is a substantial difference

5 between being disabled and being eligible to get the

6 discharge. Discharge requires permanent disability --

7 forever, you cannot -- you are not capable of working. In

8 Social Security law, you have to be incapable of working

9 for a period of 12 months.

10 Thank you.

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.

12 The case is submitted.

13 [Whereupon, at 11:49 a.m., the case in the

14 above-entitled matter was submitted.]
