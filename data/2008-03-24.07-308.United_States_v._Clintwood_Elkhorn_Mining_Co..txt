1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:41 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in Case 07-308, United States versus Clintwood 5 Elkhorn Mining Company. 6 Mr. Jay. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 Respondent sought and received a full refund 12 of the tax they paid on exported coal for the full 13 three-year period permitted them by the tax-refund 14 statute. What the court of appeals' decision permitted 15 them to do was to bring an additional action for 16 indistinguishable relief, but for a three-year period 17 beyond what the tax-refund statute permits. 18 We submit that that decision was erroneous 19 for two principal reasons: First, the plaintiff -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It might help if you 21 raise that lectern a bit. 22 MR. JAY: Hang on. 23 Is that better, Your Honor. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, thank you. 25 MR. JAY: Thank you.

1 The plain and unabiguous terms of the 2 tax-refund statute, section 7422(a), expressly provide 3 that any claimant who alleges that a tax has been 4 illegally assessed, no matter the reason, must before 5 proceeding to court file a refund claim with the 6 Internal Revenue Service within three years after filing 7 the tax return on which the illegal tax was paid. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Jay, is the government 9 running with the fox and chasing with the hounds? You 10 want us to apply the provisions governing the Internal 11 Revenue Code with regard to whether the statute has 12 expired, but when it comes to interest you say oh, no, 13 no, no, that doesn't apply. Why? Why shouldn't the two 14 go pari passu, as we say? 15 MR. JAY: Well, we think, Your Honor, that 16 the interest provision is in fact a key part of the 17 tax-refund statute and so Respondent's attempt to invoke 18 the tax-refund judgment interest provision is 19 inconsistent with their theory, that they're proceeding 20 outside the scope of the tax --21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, yes, they make the same 22 mistake, but that doesn't justify your making the same, 23 the same mistake. 24 MR. JAY: Well, we think, Your Honor -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's either, you
4

1 know, they're both in one pot or they're both in the 2 other pot. And both sides want to -- want to split them 3 up, but why don't they go together? 4 MR. JAY: Well, we think the whole case is 5 in the Title 26 pot, Your Honor, that the whole case 6 should proceed under the provisions of Title 26, meaning 7 that Respondents have already received the full tax 8 refund to which they are entitled. And to be sure, they 9 received interest on that refund. And had they to sue 10 for it, they would have received interest under section 11 2411. But because they are -- because they are no 12 longer able to proceed under the exclusive tax-refund 13 procedure, of course we think that they -- that they 14 can't plead around that by claiming constitutional 15 damages instead. 16 But if the Court were to agree with them and 17 agree that they could pursue damages for a violation of 18 the Export Clause, section 2411 does not apply to such a 19 claim because it's not a claim for an overpayment of 20 tax. The term "overpayment" in the interest statute 21 ties back to the section 6402, which is the linchpin of 22 the tax-refund statute. And the -- when a taxpayer has 23 made an overpayment, that triggers the obligation of the 24 IRS to provide a tax refund if one is timely sought, and 25 if one isn't timely sought, as this Court recognized in

1 the Brockamp case, the Congress has provided an 2 unusually emphatic limitation on the Commissioner's 3 ability to refund. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: Can you explain one thing 5 to me? I take it that they -- everybody says they went 6 through all the right IRS hoops to get back three years' 7 worth of damages, i.e., they get their payments back and 8 they get interest. 9 MR. JAY: That's right. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what they want is they 11 want three years before that. 12 MR. JAY: That's right. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: And they're too late under 14 Title 26. So what you're saying is, one, you can't get 15 any interest and, two, you can't get your money back at 16 all. 17 MR. JAY: Well, on the interest, Your Honor, 18 we're saying that they were entitled to the interest on 19 the three years. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm saying for three years 21 they're home-free. They get their payment back and they 22 get their interest. Now let's go to the three preceding 23 years. I'm a little confused about that because I can't 24 work out -- I suppose that the government is saying: 25 You get nothing, you don't get your money back, and you
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 don't get your interest. Or is the government saying: 2 You get your money back; you just don't get the 3 interest? Which is it? And I don't see how it could be 4 the latter. 5 MR. JAY: It is the former, Your Honor -6 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 7 MR. JAY: -- because we're saying that 8 because Respondents waited for 21 years while paying the 9 tax without -- without filing a refund claim, that 10 they're limited to the three years immediately preceding 11 the refund claim -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. I thought you were 13 making a second argument, that even if they were 14 entitled to it despite the statute, they wouldn't be 15 entitled to interest. You don't make that claim? 16 MR. JAY: No. If they were entitled to sue, 17 not under the tax -- under the tax code at all, but on 18 the theory countenanced by the court of appeals, that 19 this is not a suit for a tax refund at all, but a suit 20 for damages arising directly under the Constitution -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. 22 MR. JAY: -- then there is no provision in 23 Title 28 or anywhere else that provides the required 24 express provision -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

1 MR. JAY: -- of interest that's necessary to 2 award interest against the government. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Right. Okay. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why shouldn't it be a 5 suit contesting the constitutionality? I mean, in the 6 usual case where you seek a refund, there are 7 adjustments that have to be made. But here, if the only 8 question is the constitutionality of the tax, then what 9 is the point of going through any kind of administrative 10 process of the refund route? 11 MR. JAY: In the context of the coal tax, 12 Your Honor, and the Export Clause claim, the purpose of 13 requiring exhaustion, requiring Respondents to proceed 14 before the IRS, is that the coal tax is exempt from 15 taxation under the Constitution only if the coal at the 16 moment the tax is imposed, which in this case is when 17 it's first sold by the manufacturer, the mining company, 18 if at that moment, the coal was in the stream of export. 19 And in the context of the coal industry that can be a 20 fairly fact-specific question, and the IRS technical 21 advice memorandum that we've cited on page 11 of our 22 reply brief explains that to some degree. So it's 23 possible for a timely refund claim to allow the IRS to 24 examine the facts and circumstances of the transaction 25 and determine whether in fact the coal was in the stream
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of export at all. 2 Further, the IRS -- if it has only an excise 3 tax return from the taxpayer, IRS has no idea what 4 percentage of that coal was exported. Well over 90 5 percent of the coal mined in the United States remains 6 in the United States and there's nothing on Form 720, 7 the excite tax return, that specifies how much of that 8 coal is exported. So effectively by filing the two-page 9 refund claim the taxpayer puts the IRS on notice of what 10 percentage of coal in the given years was in fact in the 11 stream of export when it was sold, whether in fact the 12 broker or whoever purchased it actually purchased it, 13 actually exported it from the country, and also how -14 what the dollar amount of tax refund is being sought. 15 So all of those, we think, are perfectly 16 valid purposes for requiring a short but reasonable time 17 to proceed before the IRS. And if the IRS denies the 18 claim, then of course Respondents could have proceeded 19 directly to court. 20 The IRS did not in fact deny their claim, 21 and the IRS has issued a notice of acquiescence 22 specifying that the coal tax -- coal taxpayers who paid 23 this coal tax and filed timely refund claims will 24 receive a refund to the full extent that Congress has 25 permitted the IRS to grant refunds.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Plus interest. 2 MR. JAY: Plus interest, that's right, Your 3 Honor. Under section 6611, interest is fully available 4 on refunds. And again, if the -- if the IRS had denied 5 the claims and Respondents had been forced to go to 6 court, they would have received interest accounting for 7 that time delay as well. 8 So we think that Section 7422 is the 9 exclusive means of bringing a claim that a tax was 10 illegally or erroneously assessed or collected. The 11 terms of the statute are clear; they're unambiguous; and 12 they're exclusive. 7422(a) simply is the only way of 13 bringing this claim. 14 And we think that whether Respondents 15 denominate their claim as a statutory-refund claim or a 16 constitutional claim, the terms of section 7244(a) 17 plainly cover it. So we think that the Court need not 18 necessarily answer the question of whether the Export 19 Clause creates a self-enforcing cause of action at all. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could the IRS say 21 that the statute -- or Congress, I guess, say the 22 statute of limitations is one month? 23 MR. JAY: To file a timely refund claim, 24 Your Honor? 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, and anything

1 after that, any constitutional violation after that, is 2 just not remediable? 3 MR. JAY: Well, the constitutional violation 4 would have taken place before in Your Honor's 5 hypothetical. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Five weeks before. 7 MR. JAY: In the McKesson case, Your Honor, 8 the Court outlined a number of the options that taxing 9 authorities have to respect their strong fiscal interest 10 in the stability of their tax revenues while providing 11 appropriate relief. And the Court listed as one way in 12 which States can -- States and other taxing authorities 13 can protect that by providing a short statute of 14 limitations. The Court also suggested that -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're talking about 16 -- we're talking about the Constitution here. And in 17 effect -- I mean, I assume I could run through the usual 18 routine. I mean, you wouldn't say they could have a 19 statute of limitations of two days, right? 20 MR. JAY: Well, Your Honor, in McKesson the 21 Court pointed to another alternative, which is requiring 22 that the tax be paid under protest. And that 23 effectively is a statute of limitations of zero days, in 24 that when -- you know, that when the tax is paid, the 25 taxpayer has to identify the basis of the constitutional
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 challenge and the amount being paid under protest. 2 And under -- and before the Tucker Act, and 3 indeed in the early years of the Tucker Act, taxes had 4 to be paid under protest or the taxpayer was out, was 5 out the remedy against the collector. And Congress has 6 since provided that in general taxpayers don't have to 7 pay their taxes under protest. Instead, they can bring 8 a refund claim within three years afterwards. But that 9 three-year limitation period, while relatively generous, 10 is absolute. 11 And the Court held in the Brockamp case that 12 the three years can't be extended, not even for an 13 individual taxpayer suffering from senile dementia for 14 the entire time period. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think there are any 16 circumstances in which a taxpayer can bring a claim 17 under the Tucker Act for the refund of an 18 unconstitutional tax? 19 MR. JAY: Well, we think -- I want to 20 clarify, Your Honor, that any lawsuit, whether it's on 21 Respondent's theory or on our theory, any lawsuit that's 22 filed is in fact under the Tucker Act. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, any situation in which 24 such a suit can be brought without having filed a claim 25 previously with the IRS?

1 MR. JAY: If the only -- if the only basis 2 for the taxpayers' recovery is that the taxpayer has 3 paid a tax and the tax was illegally or erroneously 4 assessed because it was unconstitutional, we think that 5 section 7422(a) and the associated time limits provide 6 the procedure for recovering under the Tucker Act. 7 Section 2501, which is what Respondents 8 contend is the only procedure that applies to the claims 9 that they have brought, section 2501, as the Court 10 recognized -11 JUSTICE ALITO: Just to be clear, so your 12 argument is not limited to the Export Clause. It 13 doesn't matter what provision of the Constitution the 14 tax violates. The same rule would apply? 15 MR. JAY: Well, the Congress has made no 16 distinction in the statute between one type of 17 constitutional claim and another, or indeed one type of 18 illegality or another. And we've cited some -- some 19 examples in our opening brief of numerous constitutional 20 provisions that taxpayers may bring challenges under. 21 And there are at least five clauses in the original 22 Constitution that regulate the Federal Government's 23 taxing authority. There are at least four more that 24 regulate the States, and, you know, not to mention the 25 Bill of Rights.

1 So constitutional claims are commonly 2 brought by taxpayers against Federal taxes, and the 3 tax-refund procedure provides a full -- a fully 4 effective, fully adequate way of vindicating that right. 5 The only requirement is that it be submitted in writing 6 to the IRS within three years after filing the tax 7 return in question. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you know, what happened 9 before the Tucker Act with inverse condemnation claims? 10 The government violates the Fifth Amendment Takings 11 Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment Takings Clause 12 applied to the Fifth by inverse condemnation, and there 13 is no Tucker Act. Was there a constitutional cause of 14 action for damages? 15 MR. JAY: Before there was the Tucker Act, 16 Your Honor, when the government took property and was 17 obliged to pay compensation, the claim was presented to 18 Congress; and Congress could legislative relief by a 19 private bill. 20 Eventually, Congress created the Court of 21 Claims purely as an Article I tribunal. There was no 22 judicial review because the decisions were always 23 subject to revision by Congress. And eventually 24 Congress, having tired of adjudicating all these claims 25 in a legislative manner, gave the Court of Claims
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 independent status with its decisions reviewable in 2 Article III courts. And so, by enacting the Tucker Act, 3 takings claims became brought in the Court of Federal 4 Claims. 5 So, because we think Section 7422(a) is a 6 completely adequate remedy for any constitutional claim 7 that Respondents might bring, we submit that this 8 Court's Bivens cases and this Court's unlawful-tax cases 9 show that there is no warrant to create a new cause of 10 action directly under the Constitution in circumstances 11 like this where the taxpayer has a fully effective 12 remedy, allows that remedy to become time-barred, but 13 instead brings a claim, purportedly under the 14 Constitution, against the identical defendant, in the 15 identical forum seeking the identical relief. Under 16 those circumstances, this Court has never fashioned a 17 Bivens-type implied cause of action for a violation of 18 the Constitution. 19 Indeed, in Bush versus Lucas, Schweiker 20 versus Chilicky, and other cases, the Court has 21 recognized that when Congress has legislated a remedial 22 scheme, it doesn't -- this Court will still stay its 23 hand before creating a new Bivens action, even if that 24 remedial scheme has very short time limits, such as the 25 30-day time limit, the civil service remedies that were
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 at issue in Bush, or the exhaustion requirement of Title 2 VII which substitutes for an equal-protection claim for 3 Federal employees. 4 Even in those circumstances, and even if the 5 remedies that are available are equitable and not money 6 damages, even in those circumstances this Court will not 7 create a new cause of action for money damages. And in 8 this case, if Respondents had filed in a timely way in 9 this -- referring to the relief that they're seeking in 10 this case, they're seeking relief for 1994, 1995 and 11 1996. If they had filed by April 30th, 1997, by which 12 point Cyprus Amex Coal Company was already vigorously 13 litigating the constitutionality of the Cole excise tax 14 in the Court of Federal Claims, if they had filed by 15 that time, they could have received full relief. 16 So their failure to assert their rights in a 17 timely way certainly didn't give the court of appeals 18 warrant to create a new Bivens-type implied right of 19 action. 20 If the Court has no further questions at 21 this time, I'll reserve. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 23 MR. JAY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Millett. 25 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 2 MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 3 please the Court: 4 This is a question of statutory construction 5 and the problem, as this Court's precedent has made 6 clear in Enochs versus Williams Packing, is that if 7 government -- if the government wants to enjoy the 8 special, extraordinary protections of the tax-refund 9 scheme, it has to assert a plausible basis for tax 10 liability. It hasn't done that here. There was never 11 any claim that they have any legitimate right to this 12 revenue as a source, as a basis, for taxes; that they 13 have any legitimate tax regulatory power over this 14 export process; or that they have any legitimate basis 15 for defending the statute as constitutional under any 16 circumstances of the law -17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Millett, if it was -18 if it was that obvious, why did it take so long for the 19 coal companies to realize that the government owed them 20 money? 21 MS. MILLETT: Justice Stevens, that's 22 because my clients are not Fortune 100 companies, and I 23 don't think the Constitution or the Congress imposes a 24 tax or tax code that require that sort of level of 25 scrutiny.

1 I've got -- we've clients here that are 2 small. They have no in-house lawyers and they had 3 accountants who paid the taxes. And so the short answer 4 is they didn't notice. 5 It's not that they looked at it and thought 6 it was constitutional. One thing that is clear is that 7 as soon as anybody looked at this statute, as soon as 8 anybody -- the courts, the government that collected the 9 tax for 20 years and did have a constitutional duty to 10 look at the Constitution, as soon as anyone looked at 11 it, there was no defense offered. This is an 12 extraordinary case, where the government made no effort 13 to defend this tax whatsoever in district court. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were there any other cases 15 where they said, well, it's not in the stream of 16 commerce yet, and there was an intermediate broker, or 17 anything like that? Are there any complexities like 18 that? 19 MS. MILLETT: Justice Kennedy, there is a 20 statutory definition, 26 U.S.C. 1421, that deals with 21 stream of commerce and it mirrors this Court's decision 22 in the A.G. Spalding case, which says that either the 23 direct sales or if your manufacturer doesn't sell 24 directly to the exporter or it has the broker, so one or 25 two steps, is stream of commerce, and after that it's
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 not going to be. That's the same thing this Court did 2 in A.G. Spaulding. 3 If someone wanted to fight about that 4 statutory application, they wouldn't be raising a 5 constitutional claim like we are here. What happened -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in none of these cases 7 did they have those sorts of problems? 8 MS. MILLETT: Not in these cases. My 9 clients -- I think almost in all of the claims they 10 directly exported it themselves. There was no dispute 11 whatsoever. 12 If there's a debate, factually or legally, 13 about whether this is the stream -- if it's not in the 14 export stream. If it's not in the export stream, it's 15 not an export or a violation. If there is a factual 16 debate, it wouldn't fall within the Enochs versus 17 Williams Packing exception. There was no factual 18 debate. There is a stipulated judgment in this case. 19 What Enochs tells us, again, is that the 20 government can't have a tax be a tax solely for the 21 purpose of curtailing constitutional recovery. That's 22 the only way that this was a legitimate tax in their 23 view, not to collect revenue. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If 7422(a) had said 25 any -- any Internal Revenue tax, including a tax imposed
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 in alleged violation of the Export Clause, that would 2 cut -- cut out the six-year statute of limitations, 3 right? If it said the refund procedure applies to any 4 Internal Revenue tax including one imposed in alleged 5 violation of the Export Clause? 6 MS. MILLETT: I think it would clear up an 7 awful lot. If I could just clarify, though. What this 8 court held in Enochs versus William Packing is that the 9 phrase "any tax" only applies if the government is at 10 least willing to assert a plausible defense for the tax. 11 And so it would depend on whether any tax would still 12 include that limitation in your scenario, if they are 13 willing to assert a plausible Export Clause. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Nothing different from 15 what it is now, but just Congress makes clear that a tax 16 and alleged violation of the Export Clause falls within 17 the term "any Internal Revenue tax"? 18 MS. MILLETT: Then I think my position would 19 be that it does not, because this Court has held for 20 half a century without Congress changing it that any tax 21 means a tax that the government asserts is valid. It 22 doesn't have to be correct. It has to assert that it's 23 valid. Otherwise it's in the guise of a tax and it 24 doesn't fall -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not certain it was
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 valid if this coal was not shipped overseas. You're 2 putting an awful burden on the government to know when 3 the coal is severed and shipped. You're saying if they 4 mistake a shipment as being only for domestic use rather 5 than for shipment abroad, they don't have any basis 6 whatever for the tax claim. I'm not sure I agree with. 7 MS. MILLETT: The problem in this case, 8 Justice Scalia, is that there were two statutes. There 9 was a statute imposing the coal tax, 26 U.S.C. 4121 -10 this is all on the first page of our brief -- and then 11 there was an amendment to the exemption for exports in 12 26 U.S.C. 4221 that specifically said the general tax 13 exemption for exports does not apply to this coal tax, 14 and that provision captured nothing but exports of coal. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Your point is that you 16 don't have to go through the refund requirements of 7422 17 if the government was -- although it did ask for the 18 money as a tax, they are really out to lunch? I mean, 19 the trouble -- is there any authority for an argument 20 like that? I mean, the trouble I guess that I would 21 have that argument is, one is linguistic, because it 22 goes on to say "or of any sum alleged to have been 23 excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected." 24 And then the other thing is just common 25 sense: Suppose you have an insane tax collector. You
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 know, I mean, that could happen. And the insane tax 2 collector they discover some years later has been 3 assessing all these penalties for no reason and people 4 have been paying some of them because, terrible tragedy, 5 terrible thing. But I guess they'd be stuck, I'd always 6 thought, with the three-year statute of limitations, so 7 even those it's really nuts. 8 Now, is there -- is there any authority for 9 us making a distinction between an insane -- to get an 10 extreme, an insane assessment of a tax and just a 11 wrongful assessment of a tax? 12 MS. MILLETT: The authority is this Court's 13 unanimous opinion in Enochs versus Williams -14 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 15 MS. MILLETT: -- which said that if -- we 16 are dealing with the same language -- no suit shall be 17 maintained for any tax in any court. And it said in 18 that, that statutory language, "any tax" means something 19 that the government can plausibly defend as a tax. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: What about the "any sum," 21 "in any manner"? You know, what about that language? 22 MS. MILLETT: Again, the key language -23 JUSTICE BREYER: "Any sum in any manner 24 wrongfully collected." 25 MS. MILLETT: Right. This Court dealt with
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that, I think it's in -- I think in Dalm, and sometimes 2 it has its own rules in the taxing, but this is -- the 3 question is any tax, and any tax doesn't mean something 4 that's just in the guise of tax, whether the guy is 5 insane or Congress just forgot to read the Export 6 Clause. But as soon as we look, everyone knows this is 7 unconstitutional, then understand what the impact of 8 that is. That means the only way this is a legitimate 9 tax under the government's rule, the only legitimate tax 10 function that this serves is to cut off constitutional 11 remedies. That's its only role. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: No. No. Their argument 13 is, I'm terribly sorry, that if the way you're hurt is 14 you paid a tax you shouldn't pay and you want to get a 15 refund, go through the administrative procedure. 16 MS. MILLETT: This Court said in Enochs that 17 you don't -- that tax -- the whole point of the Tax 18 Exemption Act is to funnel everybody in for tax refund 19 procedure. And this court said you don't have to go if 20 it is not a tax. And what they mean by not a tax, is 21 that it can't plausibly be defended by the government as 22 a tax. This doesn't happen often. This is an 23 extraordinary exception. But this is the case where it 24 did. And if the government -25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why do you -- I
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 take it, though, that you concede the six-year statute 2 of limitations under the Tucker Act, right? I mean, 3 your brief says this is an unbending and unqualified 4 prohibition on the use of exports except up to -- if 5 it's before six years and one day. You are taking an 6 adamant position with respect to three years but you 7 give up six years. 8 MS. MILLETT: No. It's unbending and wrong 9 whether it's within six years or ten years. But we 10 agree that a constitutional right can have a statute of 11 limitation -- if there is a constitutional right that 12 doesn't have any statute of limitations, I don't know 13 what it is and it's not this one. The question is -14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why aren't three years 15 enough? 16 MS. MILLETT: I'm sorry? 17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why aren't three years 18 enough? 19 MS. MILLETT: Because it's a question of 20 statutory construction. And Congress determined what 21 the right statute of limitation is for a constitutional 22 claim, and that's six years. If Congress had a 23 three-year statute of limitations under the Tucker Act 24 for all constitutional claims, we wouldn't be here. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so, the

1 rhetoric in your brief how this is a constitutionally 2 based prohibition is not pertinent? You're saying if 3 the statute was clear and it said three years, that 4 would be fine, even though it's a claim under the Export 5 Clause? 6 MS. MILLETT: We don't -- to the Export 7 Clause, right, distinguishes between three years and six 8 years in its own right. What the Export Clause does, 9 though, there is the statutory construction argument and 10 we have the Enochs argument, but we also think there are 11 substantial constitutional concerns here. And the 12 Export Clause makes it most imperative for this Court to 13 continue to adhere to its definition of any tax, and 14 that's because -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is the Export Clause 16 so, so significant? The only other self-executing 17 constitutional clause that provides for damages 18 automatically that comes to mind is the Takings Clause. 19 And we have allowed the states to require claimants to 20 jump through innumerable hoops. They have to exhaust 21 all their administrative remedies before they can bring 22 a suit here. Why -- why is the Export Clause any -- any 23 more sacrosanct? 24 MS. MILLETT: Because we don't -- under the 25 Constitution the government hasn't done anything wrong

1 unless -- until -- unless and until it actually effects 2 a taking and doesn't pay for it through process. Those 3 processes are how we determine -- get to the point where 4 there has been an actual constitutional violation here. 5 No administrative process is necessary to 6 have -- to know that tax has been posed on exports. And 7 what's distinct about the Export Clause, to get back to 8 Chief Justice Roberts' question, is that it is -- this 9 Court said unanimously in U.S. Shoe, a simple, direct, 10 unqualified prohibition on congressional tax power in 11 terms, and it disallows any effort to raise revenue 12 through the Tax Power Act. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Volenti non fit injuria. 14 If indeed the taxpayer pays out the money for an 15 unconstitutional export tax, it seems to me that person 16 has no claim until he complies with the administrative 17 procedures that render that tax unconstitutional. But 18 up until the point where he is paying it voluntarily, it 19 seems to me there is no constitutional violation. 20 MS. MILLETT: Congress eliminated in the 21 early 1920s any prepayment protest requirement under the 22 tax law. And the tax law -- the Internal Revenue Code 23 applies sweepingly to Americans across this country, 24 vast majority of whom are not equipped with tax lawyers 25 at their side to make protests at the moment they pay

1 their taxes. That's never been required. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not saying it has to be 3 made at the moment they pay their taxes. I'm just 4 saying until it's made there is no unconstitutional, 5 unconstitutional export tax. 6 MS. MILLETT: That's right. Until the tax 7 -- well, it would be an unconstitutional statute on the 8 books. No one has been injured by it or affected by it 9 until somebody actually pays it or is required by the 10 government to pay it. I don't dispute that, but keep in 11 mind we're dealing with a tax refund scheme. The tax 12 refund scheme is an extraordinary creature in the law 13 for many good reasons but that -- that reverses the 14 order of everything. It makes you pay before any 15 entitlement has been shown to that money by the 16 government. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you didn't have 18 to pay -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Here there was a payment. 20 Here there was a payment. 21 MS. MILLETT: Yes. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's different than if you 23 try to enjoin the collection at the outset. 24 MS. MILLETT: It's only -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that argument doesn't

MILLETT: It's only different in the 3 sense that government's interests are less, and the 4 government's interests are most acute in having people 5 pointed to the tax-refund scheme, this Court has said 6 time and again, before -- to pay first and fight later. 7 And as a result -- I mean, if it's most acute -8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what about the 9 deficiency procedure? And I don't know if that applies 10 with excise taxes, but suppose they didn't pay this tax 11 and they get a notice of deficiency. Where would they 12 go? 13 MS. MILLETT: There -- there's nowhere for 14 them to go for this particular tax. You can't go to tax 15 court. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not? 17 MS. MILLETT: Because tax court doesn't 18 apply to excise taxes for the most part. There may be a 19 few exceptions. It essentially applies to income gift 20 and estate taxes, and it certainly didn't apply to this 21 provision here. They could have -- they could have 22 gotten the assessment and gotten on the phone with an 23 IRS. Otherwise they'd have to wait for a lien or levy. 24 Now, the government, by the way, has -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if we -- if we

MILLETT: The -- the 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- which is just what 6 Justice Ginsburg's questions point out. And earlier I 7 had indicated that in this case they did pay the tax. 8 MS. MILLETT: I -9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seems to me there is 10 a distinction. It may be that you would prevail in your 11 argument. 12 MS. MILLETT: I know. We couldn't have -13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If they tried -- if they 14 tried -- do you think they could enjoin the collection 15 of a tax refund? 16 MS. MILLETT: No, they couldn't because in 17 addition to showing the government's imposition of the 18 tax is legally indefensible, you still have to show 19 entitlement to an injunction, and unless you can 20 establish irreparable harm just by paying money, which 21 I'm not aware of any coal company that could have, you 22 could have gotten an injunction. And -23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, I mean, in your 24 argument you say it is absolutely -- that it doesn't 25 apply. Just get an injunction.
29
Alderson Reporting Company

1 MS. MILLETT: You can't get an injunction 2 just because something is unlawful. That's never been 3 allowed under equity. You also have to show irreparable 4 harm. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then we'll invent 6 the hypothetical company that is going to go broke and 7 all that stuff. 8 MS. MILLETT: But I mean, it's not a 9 question of inventing. This Court dealt with exactly 10 that question in Enochs, where -- Enochs versus Williams 11 Packing, and later again in South Carolina versus Regan, 12 and Commissioner versus Shapiro -- that you can't just 13 come in and say it's unlawful, that you actually have to 14 then establish irreparable harm. Everything in the tax 15 scheme points to taxpayers with enormous penalties and 16 enormous risks to pay first, fight later. And when a 17 taxpayer does that, it's also -18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you can't have it both 19 ways. You're saying it isn't a tax for your purposes, 20 and then in my hypothetical case you say you have to go 21 through the tax law. 22 MS.

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MS. MILLETT: It's the government that wants 2 to have it both ways. It wants to say it is a tax just 3 for purposes of making it a nonconstitutional case under 4 the Tucker Act and to make it the tax scheme, but in no 5 way is this defensible as a tax. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: In looking at your 7 argument, I see it now, I think, if I'm right. You're 8 -- that it would have very broad reach. It would reach 9 -- it doesn't just concern the constitutional claim; it 10 concerns any claim you'd have against the IRS. And 11 there's authority that says if the IRS' position is too 12 far out, you can go get an injunction. That's what 13 you're pointing to. And then you're argument is, 14 because of that authority, that kind of an exception for 15 the far out IRS claim also applies to the statute of 16 limitation and administrative requirement. And your 17 problem is the latter has never been held. And the 18 reason that that's a problem, I take it, is because when 19 you're talking about injunctions, you're talking about 20 basic equity, but when you're talking about later on 21 administrative requirements, there's really no reason 22 they couldn't have filed the claim. And if we were to 23 accept an argument on the -- to the contrary and 24 analogize it, it's going to cut through rules, 25 regulations, statutes, constitutional claims,
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 everything, really making a hash of their provision 2 there -- of the administrative provision. So, what is 3 your response to that thought which -4 MS. MILLETT: I have two responses: One, 5 it's going to have far less effect on this situation, in 6 the post-payment situation, than it did in Enochs, where 7 it wasn't limited to the Export Clause. This situation 8 is only going to work where you not only establish the 9 government has no basis for this tax, a hard thing to 10 do, but that you have a money-mandating constitutional 11 provision. There aren't many of them. If you don't 12 have a money-mandating position, you've got nowhere else 13 to go but the tax scheme. 14 So it's extremely limited, but I want to get 15 back -- this is not about an equity rule. This Court 16 was specific in Enochs versus Williams Packing, when it 17 said, our prior decision under Miller versus Standard 18 Nut, in which you had done a more generous view of this 19 get around the Tax Injunction Act, was wrong, because 20 the Tax Injunction Act is not an equitable rule. Enochs 21 was a statutory construction rule. Pages 6, 7, and 8 of 22 that decision make it plain in terms -- you talk about 23 what the act requires, and the language of this Court is 24 construing is the phrase "any tax." And if it has no 25 legitimate basis, then it's in the guise of a tax.

1 That same language has been on the books for 2 almost half a century. Congress went back from the Tax 3 Injunction Act eight times without changing it in 4 response to this Court's decisions. Enochs has been 5 reaffirmed by this Court five times. Congress enacted 6 an entirely new Internal Revenue Code in 1986 that used 7 that "any tax" language in 7422, with this Court's five 8 decisions on the book and kept that language. And it 9 makes sense. Congress doesn't -- doesn't enact a tax 10 where it's only tax function -11 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you want to do 12 about your argument, as I hear it, has nothing to do 13 with the nature of the claim that you're asserting to 14 get the money back. It has to do with the nature of the 15 IRS's defense and -- well, can you do it that way? Can 16 you say the word "any tax" or "any claim" -- I can't 17 remember that other. What was it? It was any -- "any 18 sum" -- "any sum" or "any tax." Can you say, well, it 19 means one thing if they are saying that the reason they 20 want it back is that it violates the Constitution, and 21 those words mean a different thing if the reason that 22 you want it back is it violates an IRS reg; it violates 23 an IRS statute. 24 MS. MILLETT: I'm not saying that "any tax" 25 means anything different. I'm just pointing out that if
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 you succeed -2 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it doesn't mean 3 anything different and then if the very far-out claim to 4 a tax is so far out it isn't a tax, that would be true 5 in the regulation context, in the statutory context as 6 well as the constitutional context. Am I missing 7 something? 8 MS. MILLETT: No, because you have to have a 9 money-mandating claim under the Constitution to fall 10 within the Tucker Act. The -- this Court said, the 11 Tucker Act for purposes of the statutory claims under 12 the Internal Revenue Code, as this court said in 13 Kreider, takes three years to the statute of 14 limitations. So I don't think, after Kreider, that you 15 would still have a six-year statute of limitations under 16 the Tucker Act for a statutory tax claim. 17 The difference is constitutional 18 enforcement, and this is fundamentally a constitutional 19 right that's being enforced. And the question is, would 20 Congress had thought -- this is all a question of 21 statutory construction -- would Congress have thought 22 this is more a constitutional claim or a tax claim? And 23 they've made the sensible decision, at least as this 24 Court construed it in Enochs, in South Carolina versus 25 Regan -- addressed it in Janis and Bob Jones University

1 and the Americans United case, all of which are in our 2 brief -3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're saying it's 4 both. You're not saying it's "either/or" because for 5 three years you did use the refund procedure. So you 6 used the refund procedure for the years that were within 7 the three-year period, and then for the years that were 8 outside the three-year period, you have this other 9 theory. So you're not saying this is not for refund. 10 That route is closed. The only route is this 11 constitutional -- this claim directly under the Export 12 Clause. But your own conduct seems to have been it's 13 our option. We can treat it as a refund claim or we can 14 treat it as a constitutional claim. 15 MS. MILLETT: One can get -- there is 16 nothing in the tax administrative scheme where one when 17 shows up to file a tax refund where you say if I go by 18 this route, I'm waiving all others. It's not like I'm 19 agreeing to go go through arbitration and forgoing my 20 rights to go through a court procedure. Congress has -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In other words, what were 22 you just telling us is that this is not a refund claim; 23 this is a constitutional claim.

1 MS. MILLETT: It's a constitutional claim to 2 get your tax money back. That's right. And the 3 administrative scheme is fully amenable to that. That's 4 certainly the government's position, and we don't 5 disagree. The question is -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Plus you get 7 interest. 8 MS. MILLETT: Yes. Absolutely. We could 9 get it on both grounds, but you get -10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're saying you get 11 interest too in either way. You're saying -- I thought 12 you said for the three years that are within the 13 three-year refund limit, you get interest and then 14 you're also saying, going back six years, you also get 15 interest. You're not saying that if you -- if you're 16 outside the refund procedure you don't get interest. 17 MS. MILLETT: Right. But that's because 18 we're -- I mean, there's a -- there's a separate 19 interest provision in the tax code for the 20 administrative refund procedure. They don't really an 21 28 U.S.C. 2411. I think it's 26 U.S.C. 6511. But 22 there's a specific administrative brief on tax -- I'm 23 sorry, interest provision for the administrative refund 24 scheme. And so, under that, when you're in the 25 administrative scheme, you get what the administrative
36
Alderson Reporting Company

1 scheme's interest provision gives you. We don't dispute 2 that. 3 And then the question is, once you've gone 4 to court, the relevant interest provision is the one in 5 28 U.S.C., not in the tax code, by the way, but in 28 6 U.S.C., providing them -- providing for interest when 7 you've recovered an overpayment of taxes. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the interest the same 9 in amount in either case? 10 MS. MILLETT: Yes, because in 2411 it 11 cross-references the -- well, let me clarify. There is 12 one potential wrinkle, but generally speaking 2411 if 13 you look at it, and it's at the end of the 14 cross-references -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 2411 -- 2411 is what you 16 use in the court when you have a straight tax refund 17 claim. It's not as though 2411 is there for some other 18 claim. It's what you get when you go to court and 19 you're suing for a refund. That's 2411. That's 20 applicable if you get a judgment for an overpayment in 21 respect of any Internal Revenue tax. That's what -22 it's in Title 28, but that's what it's for. It's for an 23 overpayment in respect of any Internal Revenue tax. 24 MS. MILLETT: This is all on page 4a of the 25 Government's brief if you want to see where it
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 cross-references the Internal Revenue interest 2 provisions. 3 No, there's nothing there that says you have 4 to have gone through the administrative scheme. All you 5 have to have is an overpayment. If you have an 6 overpayment, under Bonwit Teller -7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- the use of any 8 Internal Revenue tax, and your whole argument is this 9 isn't an Internal Revenue tax. So it's clearly not an 10 Internal Revenue tax that you have a constitutional 11 claim directly under the Constitution, so how does it 12 become for purposes of 2411 an Internal Revenue tax? 13 MS. MILLETT: I'm sorry, I misunderstood 14 your question, Justice Ginsburg. But I want to make 15 clear that you don't have to go through the refund 16 scheme to get this. This interest would apply in Bonwit 17 Teller for accounts stated, in the Rosenman case for 18 deposit on taxes. That's how we read it. 19 Your second point, yes, that if we say this 20 is not a plausible tax under Enochs versus Williams, 21 that I think, and if this Court agrees, that this is not 22 a tax under Enochs versus Williams, so that we're not 23 bound by 7422, then I agree that our interest argument 24 becomes harder at that point textually. 25 I will tell you that I still think the fact
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that they say "in respect of any Internal Revenue tax" 2 gives us room to say that where the government has at 3 least treated it and collected the money as though it 4 were an Internal Revenue tax, that might be a way to get 5 interest. If this Court agrees, though, that it's 6 not -7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't agree in 8 your basic claim that if the government is treating it 9 as an Internal Revenue tax, which it certainly didn't, 10 you'd say that works only for the interest, not -11 MS. MILLETT: Only -- I'm sorry. Only 12 because we have the "in respect of language." That's 13 the only -- but if this Court disagrees with that, and 14 we recognize it's harder if this Court agreed, we have a 15 separate constitutional argument that the Export Clause, 16 just like the Just Compensation Clause requires interest 17 paid in its own right. And so that's the alternative 18 basis. 19 And this Court, of course, can affirm the 20 judgment on any basis supported by the record. 21 But I want to get back. Very clearly that 22 there is, the bottom -- I mean, Justice Scalia, you 23 talked about, you know, which pot you want to put this 24 in. The rarity of this case and what's unique about it 25 is that the government came in agreeing up front,
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 stipulated judgment, no fact dispute, no law disputes, 2 this is in the pot of no legitimate status of the tax. 3 No claim whatsoever. The government couldn't think of 4 anything. 5 But for purposes of limiting your 6 constitutional relief, then it's in the pot of a 7 legitimate. Tax and we think they can't have it both, 8 ways and particularly as a matter of statutory 9 construction. This is ultimately a question of which 10 scheme is better fitted to vindicating the Constitution. 11 And Congress said any tax, just like it said in the Tax 12 Injunction Act. This court has said what any tax means. 13 It said it five times after Enochs. And Congress has 14 not reacted to it. 15 Stare decisis applies most powerfully in the 16 statutory construction Congress -- context, and if 17 Congress thought there were a problem with what -- with 18 how this Court defined any tax, it would have said so. 19 It could have done so. It's had half a century to do 20 something. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You give all of this 22 up when it comes to the statute of limitations. I mean, 23 the government's argument could be just as implausible 24 as you suggested it is here. But if it involves a claim 25 six years and one day out, it's just too bad. It
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 doesn't matter that it's a constitutional claim. It 2 doesn't matter how erroneous the government's position 3 was, because the government can impose limitations like 4 that even on the assertion of constitutional claims. 5 That's all they are doing here. 6 MS. MILLETT: But the Tucker Act doesn't use 7 the "word any tax" in defining the statute of 8 limitations. It's a statute of limitations for 9 constitutional claims. 10 Our argument is what the word "any tax" 11 means in 7422 and does it force us to go through the tax 12 refund scheme. Our argument is, as this Court said 13 unanimously in Enochs -- the decision has never been 14 questioned by any justice of this court -- that any tax 15 does not apply if it had no tax status for any other 16 purpose. It can't be just to limit -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We say just as 18 unanimously a couple of things last year on -- term as 19 well in Jencks and certainly the Federal circuit's 20 decision wouldn't have come out the same if they had had 21 Hinck's term of trust on the books. 22 MS. MILLETT: I'm not sure -- I'm not sure 23 it would have come out differently. Maybe they would 24 have explained things differently. But this Court said 25 in most cases the question is which statutory scheme is
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 better fitted. And at two levels we think the Tucker 2 Act is better fitted for this claim. 3 One, because any tax only applies when there 4 is asserted legitimate basis for the tax; and two, the 5 Export Clause is a unique limitation, specifically 6 denies the government any authority to use exports as a 7 source of revenue. And you have a refund scheme here 8 that has been designed over the years specifically to 9 protect revenue interest, to make you pay the revenue 10 first and have them hold it. 11 It's not just holding them for six months. 12 They had to pay every two weeks. But, of course, the 13 government didn't treat that as paid for purposes of 14 interest until the end of the quarter when a return was 15 filed. That's one way why the interest calculation 16 might be different under the Tucker Act than it would be 17 under the refund scheme, just the timing of whether it's 18 the deposit or the actual return. 19 Justice Kennedy, I forgot to get back to you 20 on that. 21 But the question here is whether the Export 22 Clause can be fully enforced by -- which it's -- it's 23 not a suggestion and it doesn't say when you're doing 24 your tax stuff, it's okay if you slop on on exports a 25 little bit. Exports are completely off limits to the
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 tax power. And Congress using its tax power to create a 2 tax scheme that specifically preserves and protects 3 revenue and is not a revenue neutral system is not the 4 best scheme for vindicating the Export Clause. It's not 5 better for that. It is at cross purposes with the 6 Export Clause. 7 But the bottom is this Court doesn't need to 8 get to that constitutional question. We think it 9 certainly informs the analysis. It certainly is enough 10 of a constitutional concern or doubt to conclude that 11 Enochs still applies any tax in the tax injunction -12 any tax in any court. No suit shall be maintained for 13 any tax in any court means the same thing in 7422 that 14 it means in the Tax Injunction Act. If Congress thought 15 it meant something different, it has had half -- almost 16 half a century to tell us. 17 It hasn't done that, and the Export Clause 18 can't serve its unique historical function of keeping 19 government's tax regulatory hands off -- hands off the 20 tax export process and the revenue out of the Federal 21 Fiske unless this is treated as a constitutional claim. 22 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 24 Ms. Millett.

JAY 5 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 6 MR. JAY: I'll be glad to, Your Honor. 7 Enochs case construed not Section 7422, but Section 8 7421, the Injunction Act provision of the tax code. And 9 the question in Enochs was whether the taxpayer simply 10 by alleging that the tax was so -- so invalidly applied 11 that it was only in the guise of the tax could avoid 12 paying the tax and bring an injunctive claim. 13 The court in Enochs held that it could not 14 because the taxpayer had not, in fact, satisfied the 15 basic requirement of all claims for injunctive relief as 16 irreparable injury. And the court also held that 17 whether a tax is defensible for purposes of this very 18 narrow exception is to be determined on the basis of the 19 information to the government at the time of suit. So 20 in this -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait what very narrow 22 exception? It didn't apply the exception. 23 MR.

1 case since, preserving the holding in Standard Nut and

2 Margarine, a case from the 1920's.

Justice Breyer

3 alluded to this when he asked my friend, Ms. Millett,

4 about whether this exception is geared primarily to

5 factual issues or to legal issues. In Standard Nut and

6 Margarine the government had decided to attempt to

7 impose a tax meant for oleomargarine on a product made

8 entirely from nuts. And this Court, you know, without

9 construing the tax-injunctive provision, simply

10 referring to principles of equity, this Court held that

11 the government's theory of assessing the tax was simply

12 in the guise of a tax and it permitted the injunctive

13 claim to proceed.

14 In Williams Packing the government's -- the

15 government had a collateral basis for assessing the tax,

16 and so the taxpayer was remitted to the same remedy that

17 any taxpayer who wants to challenge a tax as having been

18 unlawfully assessed or collected is subject to; that is,

19 to pay the tax, file a refund claim, and if the refund

20 claim is upheld either by the IRS or subsequently in

21 court, to receive a full refund with interest.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't the two go together?

23 If you could bring an injunction action, surely you

24 don't have to pay the tax.

1 requirements for injunctive relief -- and Williams 2 Packing, the taxpayer, couldn't; and in the cases since 3 the taxpayer couldn't -- then the court can enjoin the 4 collection of the taxes applied to you. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's what she is 6 saying. She is saying that those conditions exist here. 7 That this is not -- not a plausible tax; and, therefore, 8 she could have gotten an injunction; and, therefore, by 9 a parity of reasoning, she doesn't have to go through 10 the tax provisions. 11 MR. JAY: I think I have three responses to 12 that. 13 One is that we don't think that a -- an 14 exception to the -- to 7421 should carry over into 15 Section 7422. But even in the circumstances of this 16 case, this is a facially constitutional tax. The tax is 17 imposed on coal mined in the United States. And if no 18 -- if none of the coal that is subject to the tax is 19 ever in the stream of export when the tax is imposed, 20 then the tax is perfectly constitutional. And that is 21 why Section 4121 remains on the books today. 22 The tax is unconstitutional only in certain 23 narrow circumstances when the coal actually is is in the 24 stream of export. As I explained -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you could say the
46

1 same about the tax on oleomargarine. It is a perfectly 2 valid tax but not when you impose it on nuts. And here 3 the tax on coal is a perfectly valid tax, but not when 4 you impose it on coal that's in the stream of export. 5 MR. JAY: But if one of these coal companies 6 had sought to enjoin the tax, the government would have 7 pointed to the provision in Williams Packing that says 8 that whether the tax is defensible is to be determined 9 on the basis of the information available to the 10 government at the time of suit until the taxpayer 11 demonstrates that the coal is actually in the stream of 12 export, which is precisely what's done during the refund 13 process that the taxpayers used in this case to show 14 that their coal was in the stream of export when they 15 obtained the refund. That's what -- that's how they 16 obtained a full -- full relief. 17 But, in any event, the history of this 18 litigation shows that this is not -- this is not a claim 19 about the facial unconstitutionality of the tax because 20 the tax continued to be collected without protest in the 21 case of the Respondents here for 21 consecutive years. 22 And by the time they filed for a refund this 23 Court had decided IBM. It had decided U.S. shoe. The 24 district court had decided Ranger Fuel, and the 25 government had announced that it would not appeal the
47

1 decision in Ranger Fuel striking down the coal tax. 2 But that doesn't mean that for that -- for 3 that entire time the government had no basis on which to 4 defend the tax. I mean the government had colorful 5 arguments to defend the tax at issue in U.S. Shoe in 6 June 1996. Shoe was in 1996. And it had colorful 7 arguments to defend the harbor maintenance tax in U.S. 8 Shoe. I may have misspoke. IBM in 1996, and U.S. Shoe 9 in 1998. 10 So to say that during the period at issue in 11 this case, 1994 through 1996, the tax was so facially 12 invalid that the narrow Williams Packing exception to 13 another statutory provision justifies Respondents' 14 attempt to circumvent the tax refund statute, we just 15 think is not correct. 16 In the case of a taxpayer who -- who can 17 satisfy the exception, you know, the Tax Code does, 18 indeed, put that taxpayer to the choice. It gives them 19 a fully effective post- payment refund remedy where they 20 can avoid any penalties and interest by paying the tax 21 and litigating for a full refund. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. Is the government's 23 view that the money that they are seeking here, if you 24 look at 7422, that it falls within the language of any 25 Internal Revenue tax alleged to be erroneously or
48

1 illegally assessed or the language "any sum alleged to 2 have been in any manner wrongfully collected," or both? 3 MR. JAY: I don't think that we need to go 4 beyond the first clause, Your Honor. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: So when I decide this case, 6 I should forget the words "any sum"? 7 MR. JAY: I mean the Court construed a 8 similar provision in Flora versus United States in 1960, 9 which explained that "any sum" is a cumulative 10 provision. So that if something is within the scope of 11 an Internal Revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously 12 or illegally collected or assessed, that's as far as you 13 need to go. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: But it means that if, in 15 fact, it is not within the scope of the word "tax," then 16 it is not within "any sum"? 17 MR. JAY: No. To the contrary, Your Honor. 18 I think that the holding in Flora is that if it's not 19 within the scope of the first provision, then you would 20 need to look at the second -- actually the third 21 provision, the "any sum" language. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: In Enochs -- she is quite 23 right, your opposing lawyer -- it says the exaction is 24 merely in the guise of a tax. And when it says it is 25 within the guise of a tax, then it doesn't fall within
49

1 the Tax Injunction Act. 2 And there it says if it is clear that under 3 no circumstances could the government ultimately 4 prevail, the central purpose of the Tax Injunction Act 5 is inapplicable. And then it's just in the guise of a 6 tax. And that, she says, is the test we should apply 7 here. So that's where I think Justice Ginsburg began. 8 What is your specific response to that? 9 MR. JAY: Well, my specific response, Your 10 Honor, first is that in this case the tax simply was not 11 in the guise of a tax. But even if, you know, today, if 12 the taxpayer were -- if a taxpayer were alleging that 13 the coal tax were in the guise of a tax and that it, 14 therefore, could bring a prepayment -- a prepayment 15 action, it does not then follow that the taxpayer could 16 still after the fact, if it opted not to bring that 17 prepayment action, the taxpayer could then escape the 18 three-year, nontollable, unusually emphatic limitation 19 period that applies to a claim for a postpayment remedy, 20 which is the exclusive means of obtaining a postpayment 21 remedy. 22 And, you know, the courts recognized time 23 and again that taxing authorities have a strong interest 24 in fiscal stability, and it effectively closes the books 25 on a particular tax year. So that taxpayers, after the
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 tax is paid, if they want to protest the tax, they have 2 three years in which to put the government on notice. 3 That, you know, even if the claim is this tax is so 4 beyond the pale that it can't be defended, they have to 5 put the government on notice of that claim. 6 And if they do, then the IRS considers it; 7 and if the IRS turns them down, then they can proceed to 8 district court or to the Court of Federal Claims. 9 In addition, I think I just wanted to 10 clarify one point about the availability of prepayment 11 remedies in this case. I think, Justice Ginsburg, my 12 friend, Miss Millett, was correct about the fact that 13 this excise tax does not -- is not susceptible to the 14 deficiency proceeding in tax court. 15 And we have cited in footnote 7 of our reply 16 brief at page 16 the possibility that there may be 17 another route if the taxpayer feels strongly about the 18 unconstitutionality of the tax and is willing to take 19 the chance that if the taxpayer's position is rejected, 20 that the taxpayer may be liable for penalties and 21 interest for not paying the tax. 22 I mean, of course, the general rule is that 23 the taxpayer is expected to pay the tax and proceed 24 postpayment by putting the IRS on notice of the claim. 25 But Congress, in Section 6330(c)(2)(B) of Title 26, has
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 provided some limited ability, if a taxpayer has not 2 previously been able to litigate the merits of the tax, 3 the taxpayer has a limited opportunity to do so first 4 before the IRS, then in Tax Court, and then before the 5 Court of Appeals. 6 And, again, on Miss Millett's supposition 7 that this is a completely, clearly unconstitutional tax, 8 then the taxpayer would have the option of doing that. 9 Again, the refund scheme is set up so that if the 10 taxpayer doesn't want to take the chance that its 11 argument will not be accepted, the taxpayer has a 12 simple, open remedy: To file a refund claim at any 13 point within three years. 14 That's exactly what Respondents did not do 15 for the 21 consecutive years that they paid this tax 16 without complaint. 17 If the Court has no further questions? 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 19 The case is submitted. We'll hear the third case 20 beginning this afternoon. 21 (Whereupon, at 11:38 a.m., the case in the 22 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 23 24 25
