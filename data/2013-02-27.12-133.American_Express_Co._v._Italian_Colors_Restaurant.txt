1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:31 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is Case Number 4 12-133, American Express v. Italian Colors Restaurant. 5 Mr. Kellogg. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL KELLOGG 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 8 MR. KELLOGG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 9 and may it please the Court: 10 The court below thrice refused to enforce 11 the parties' arbitration agreement because he thought 12 that class procedures were necessary to vindicate the 13 plaintiff's Sherman Act claims. 14 That holding was reversible error for at 15 least three reasons. First, it has no basis in either 16 the FAA or the Sherman Act. Second, it creates an 17 unworkable threshold inquiry. And third, it is 18 unnecessary to any legitimate policy concerns raised by 19 the court below. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kellogg, suppose it 21 goes to arbitration as you think it should, and the 22 arbitrator says to the merchant, to prove your case, you 23 have to show the relevant market, you have to show that 24 American Express had market power, that it used that 25 power to the detriment of its competitors, and the way
3

1 these sections -- the way these tying cases have gone 2 is you get an expert. And I don't see that you can 3 prove it in -- in a new way. 4 I mean, the whole point of this is that the 5 expense to win one of these cases is enormous. And no 6 single person is not worth that person's while. 7 MR. KELLOGG: Well, three responses to that, 8 Your Honor. The first is, that it is up to the 9 arbitrator in the first instance to devise procedures to 10 deal with claims in an efficient and cost-effective 11 manner. 12 Second, to the extent that an expert report 13 is required that would cost a lot of money, we have 14 conceded below that the parties could share costs of 15 that expert just as they could share the costs of a 16 lawyer. 17 And, third, the alternative is to have an 18 inquiry upfront, that this Court has rejected in 19 Concepcion, that you cannot condition the enforcement of 20 an arbitration agreement on the availability of class 21 procedures. 22 It's up to -23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the -- what was 24 the -- I missed that. The sharing of the costs, how 25 does that work? It's certainly not in the agreement,
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 not in the arbitration agreement, that -- that American 2 Express is going to pay for the expert for the other 3 side. 4 MR. KELLOGG: We acknowledge below that they 5 could share costs among multiple plaintiffs -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Oh. Oh. 7 MR. KELLOGG: -- before that. The sharing 8 of costs. Now, under the court below's regime -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then what you would 10 you have, five, six different arbitrations going, and in 11 each of those five or six cases, you would have -- they 12 could share? They could share the million dollar cost 13 of this -- the experts? 14 MR. KELLOGG: They can share the cost of the 15 expert. And, of course, they get their attorneys' fees 16 back, plus reasonable statutory costs, plus potentially 17 treble damages. 18 The alternative, as the court below held, is 19 that the district court has to decide in the first 20 instance, I'm not going to send it to arbitration 21 because I think they need a class action. To make that 22 determination, he first has to do a Rule 23 analysis. 23 Would there even be a class certified in this case? 24 Only 20 percent of putative classes are 25 certified. And that's not an inquiry that the Court
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 should be making at the outset. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I'm sorry, but I 3 don't think I got the answer to my question. Is -- the 4 arbitrator has now said we have to have an expert, and 5 the plaintiff says -- or the complainant says, I haven't 6 got the wherewithal, and if I have six friends who bring 7 individual arbitrations, that's not nearly enough. 8 So what happens then, the case ends, and 9 it's not possible -10 MR. KELLOGG: As we said, they would be able 11 to share an expert between multiple plaintiffs, but 12 there is no guarantee in the law that every claim has a 13 procedural path to its effective vindication. 14 This Court held in Eisen, for example, even 15 though the Court acknowledged that it was a $70 claim, 16 it could only be brought as a class action, but the 17 plaintiff in that case said, I can't afford to do the 18 notice costs, and the Court said well, then, the class 19 is decertified because the plaintiff has to put up the 20 notice. 21 The whole point of arbitration of course is 22 that it expands the universe of claims that can be 23 brought efficiently and effectively for small consumers. 24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kellogg, do you think 25 that if in your arbitration agreement you had a clause
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 which just said, I hereby agree not to bring any Sherman 2 Act claim against American Express, could -- could your 3 arbitration agreement do that? 4 MR. KELLOGG: Under this Court's decision in 5 Mitsubishi, I believe not. 6 JUSTICE KAGAN: It -- it couldn't, 7 right because we would say no, there has to be an -- an 8 opportunity for a vindication of statutory rights, is 9 that right? 10 MR. KELLOGG: Correct. 11 JUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and suppose that the 12 arbitration clause said something different. Suppose 13 that the arbitration clause said, I -- I hereby agree 14 that I will not present any economic evidence in an 15 antitrust action against American Express. 16 Could it do that? 17 MR. KELLOGG: I think that would be subject 18 to review under State unconscionability principles, and 19 would probably be struck down, Your Honor, just like any 20 other provision that essentially prevents -21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, even putting aside 22 State unconscionability principles, wouldn't you think 23 that our Mitsubishi case and our Randolph case would 24 again come in and say, my gosh, this arbitration clause 25 prevents any effective vindication of the rights to
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 bring an antitrust suit. 2 Wouldn't you say that. 3 MR. KELLOGG: I -- I don't think Mitsubishi 4 can be read that broadly, Your Honor. To the contrary, 5 the whole point of Mitsubishi was that arbitration is an 6 effective forum for vindicating Federal statutory 7 rights. Mitsubishi -8 JUSTICE KAGAN: So you think -- I'm sorry. 9 Go ahead. 10 MR. KELLOGG: I'm sorry. Mitsubishi dealt 11 with the very specific question of a waiver, a 12 substantive waiver of your rights, not with the 13 procedures to vindicate those rights. 14 As, for example, in the Vimar Seguros case, 15 where the Court said, well, you might have to go to 16 Japan, but we're not going to get into the business of 17 weighing the costs and benefits. 18 JUSTICE KAGAN: So I just want to make sure 19 I understand your answer, which is that you read 20 Mitsubishi and Randolph as so narrow that you would say 21 that the principle that they embody does not prevent 22 American Express from saying, you cannot produce -- you 23 cannot use any economic expert or any economic testimony 24 in an antitrust suit. 25 MR. KELLOGG: You know, I think the better
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 place to handle that would be State unconscionability 2 law. Whether the Court would want to expand the ports 3 of Mitsubishi to say that. 4 It's not clear to me what the statutory 5 justification for that would be, given that the Sherman 6 Act -- the question here, of course, concerns class 7 procedures. And given that the Sherman Act was passed 8 at a time when there were no class procedures, and given 9 that the Court in Concepcion -10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, my -- my question is 11 not about class procedures, it's about allowing economic 12 evidence to help prove your claim. And you said, no 13 problem, even though it is, of course, true in the real 14 world that to prove a successful antitrust claim, you 15 need economic evidence. 16 MR. KELLOGG: Correct. 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: And you said that's 18 fine because you're going to read Mitsubishi and 19 Randolph in such a way that it allows an arbitration 20 clause to 100 percent effectively absolutely frustrate 21 your ability to bring a Sherman Act suit. 22 MR. KELLOGG: I have no doubt that such a 23 provision would be struck down. I think the proper way 24 to do that would be under State unconscionability law, 25 which Section 2 specifically preserves. But if the
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Court felt the need to expand Mitsubishi in that narrow 2 respect, that would still not help the Respondents here, 3 who are saying that you should condition the enforcement 4 of the arbitration clause on the availability of class 5 procedures, which this Court held in Concepcion is 6 fundamentally inconsistent with the purposes of the FAA. 7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I think -- I think 8 what they are saying is something a little bit 9 different, which is that if you go -- if you accept my 10 premise that the arbitration clause could not say no 11 economic evidence, what the -- Respondents here are 12 saying is, well, now you have to give us the ability to 13 produce economic evidence and maybe that involves class 14 procedures, maybe it involves something else. 15 It could involve some other cost-sharing 16 mechanism. But if the arbitration clause works to 17 prevent us from sharing costs in such a way that we can 18 produce that evidence, then once again we have a problem 19 about completely frustrating the effect of the Sherman 20 Act. 21 MR. KELLOGG: Well, I think -- I think not 22 Your Honor. And I think we have to return to the fact that 23 the only provision at issue here was the class action 24 waiver. That was the only issue that they raised below. 25 It was the issue decided by the Court. It was the issue
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 on which this Court granted certiorari, and it's 2 directly contrary to this Court's decision in 3 Concepcion. 4 I have no doubt that if there were 5 provisions in a contract that essentially prevented a 6 plaintiff from raising a substantive claim or from 7 presenting evidence that they might have in support of 8 that claim, that it would be struck down under State 9 unconscionability principles or under Mitsubishi. But I 10 don't think we can expand Mitsubishi into a 11 free-floating inquiry for district courts into the costs 12 and benefits of each case. 13 They would have to sit down and say, well, 14 what evidence is going to be needed in this case and how 15 much evidence is going to be required. They would have 16 to say, what are the document production costs? 17 According to the court of appeals, they would even need 18 to say, what are your chances of winning? Because, say 19 it's going to cost a million dollars, but you only have 20 a 50 percent chance -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the only thing 22 that the court of appeals said is, you have to pay 23 300,000 minimum for the expert, the most you can get in 24 treble damages is 5,000. It didn't go into all the 25 other things that you were saying. It said nobody in
11

Alderson Reporting Company

1 his right mind will bring such a lawsuit to pay $300,000 2 to get $5,000. 3 MR. KELLOGG: And nobody in their right mind 4 in Eisen would -- would pay a million dollars in notice 5 costs to get $70 on -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess you could have said 7 the same thing under the Sherman Act before Rule 23 8 existed, right? 9 MR. KELLOGG: You could have. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Before there was such as 11 thing as class actions. 12 MR. KELLOGG: Under that position -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: The same thing would have 14 been true. If, indeed, your claim was so small that you 15 can't claim -- can't pay an expert, you, as a practical 16 matter, don't bring the suit. 17 MR. KELLOGG: That was true. In fact, 18 Congress at the time of passing the Sherman Act 19 specifically considered adding class procedures and 20 declined to do so. For the first 4 decades of the 21 Sherman Act, there were no class procedures even left. 22 Even today, in court, as I noted, only 23 20 percent of cases actually get the class certified. 24 The whole point of arbitration, as I noted, is to expand 25 the scope of claims, small consumer claims, that can be
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 brought in an efficient and cost-effective manner. 2 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think the nature of 3 their underlying -- their antitrust claim is relevant to 4 this? They are claiming that they were unlawfully 5 compelled to enter into the contract that they say, as a 6 practical matter, precludes them from raising the 7 antitrust issue. Does that -- does it matter? 8 MR. KELLOGG: Well, a couple of points on 9 that. They certainly weren't compelled to enter the 10 contract. Lots of merchants don't take American 11 Express. It was a voluntary choice on their part. But 12 more fundamentally, the only provision that they have 13 ever challenged in this case is the class action waiver. 14 They have not suggested below that there was any problem 15 with cost-sharing or other ways that they might deal 16 with the specific question how to present their case in 17 arbitration. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the AT&T Mobility 19 case, the Court remarked that this was a -- that the 20 arbitration agreement had certain provisions that made 21 it easier for the consumer to use the arbitral forum. 22 Is there anything like that in this arbitration clause? 23 MR. KELLOGG: I'm sorry, I didn't -- I 24 didn't quite follow that, Your Honor. A provision in 25 the arbitration clause that makes it easier to -
13

Official
1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, where not some other 2 consumer in another arbitration, not that sharing of the 3 costs, but wasn't AT&T Mobility going to pick up a good 4 part of the tab of the cost of the arbitration? 5 MR. KELLOGG: That's correct, there were 6 provisions in AT&T that the Court said would make small 7 value claims easier to process. I would note that in 8 Concepcion the Court said even if small value claims 9 could not be brought, it would still fundamentally 10 change the nature of arbitration to insist upon class 11 procedures. So I don't think that helps them in 12 distinguishing Concepcion. 13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: One of the ways I have 14 been thinking about this case is to think about 15 arbitration and the whole point of arbitration is to 16 have a procedure where you don't have costs, you have as 17 an arbitrator an antitrust expert or the best in the 18 class in the third year antitrust course in law school. 19 And they cite reports, and -- you know, it's 20 classic to have contractors sit in as arbitrators in 21 construction claims; just because it's cheaper and they 22 know -- so I was thinking that that's substantial 23 justification for your position. But your argument so 24 far seems to say that doesn't make any difference. Even 25 if they can't bring the suit in an economic way -- the
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 arbitration in an economic way, that that's irrelevant. 2 That's -- that's what I'm getting from your argument. 3 MR. KELLOGG: I did not mean to imply that, 4 Your Honor. The key point is that it's up to the 5 arbitrator in the first instance to find the most 6 efficient and cost effective way to resolve a particular 7 claim. 8 And it's not necessarily the case that 9 complicated -- that huge numbers of documents -10 plaintiff said, we will need 5 million documents and we 11 will need a very, very expensive expert and they got an 12 affidavit from a very, very expensive expert saying, 13 this is what I would charge to do this. 14 The whole point of arbitration, of course, 15 is that its informality actually expands the universe of 16 claims, of small value claims that can be brought 17 effectively. 18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kellogg, are you 19 suggesting that you can win an antitrust suit in 20 arbitration without presenting economic evidence of such 21 things as monopoly power, antitrust injury, damages? 22 How could somebody do that? 23 MR. KELLOGG: No, I acknowledge that they 24 would probably need a report in this case. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? I mean, I could be
15

Alderson Reporting Company

1 your arbitrator. I know exactly what I would do. I 2 would ask for five things, which will be admitted, and 3 one thing that's going to be difficult for them to 4 prove. I don't see why an expert in antitrust would 5 have to have this enormous report. 6 MR. KELLOGG: Well, I -- perhaps I -7 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to concede I'm wrong? -8 MR. KELLOGG: -- conceded too much to 9 Justice Kagan. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, maybe. 11 (Laughter.) 12 MR. KELLOGG: But in this case, if you look 13 at the complaint, the market definition that they're 14 seeking to establish is, if I might put it, somewhat 15 gerrymandered. It essentially consists -16 JUSTICE BREYER: If you want to argue that 17 stuff, which I -- then I guess maybe they're right. 18 Maybe you do need experts on that. I don't know that we 19 want to get into this, but I just want to know if you 20 want to concede that there is no way to win this case in 21 arbitration unless they spend $300,000. 22 MR. KELLOGG: I did not mean to concede that 23 at all, Your Honor. The whole point of arbitration is 24 the informality and the speed of the procedures. 25 And in addition, to the extent that there
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 does need to be some sort of safety valve, of course 2 Congress can deal with that question. Congress recently 3 in the Dodd-Frank Act said, in certain circumstances 4 we're going to allow the Consumer Financial Protection 5 Board to determine whether class action waivers will be 6 permitted. But obviously there's nothing either in the 7 FAA or in the Sherman Act that would justify such an 8 inquiry here. 9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Kellogg, could I 10 go back to Justice Alito's point because I'm not sure I 11 quite understood your -- your answer to it. 12 Essentially, the claim here, right, is that this is a 13 party with a monopolistic power, such that -- and this 14 is just the Plaintiff's allegation, it may or may not be 15 true, but -- but they say that American Express is using 16 its market power to impose particular contract terms. 17 And they have a tying thing, but it could just as easily 18 be the case that American Express could be using its 19 economic power to impose terms essentially making 20 arbitration of antitrust claims impossible. 21 And why shouldn't we understand this problem 22 as connected to the very allegation that's being 23 brought? That -- you know, how is it, how is it going 24 to be possible in a case where there's a monopoly power 25 able -- able to impose contracts terms that -- that you
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 can create an arbitration clause, which essentially 2 prevents that from being challenged? 3 MR. KELLOGG: Well, there is a separate 4 issue below which the court did not reach about whether 5 the arbitration clause itself had been improperly 6 imposed. But the question before the Court has to do 7 with the class action waiver, which this Court in 8 Concepcion said there's no statutory basis for the 9 courts to preclude application of that waiver. 10 It's also -- would create a completely 11 unworkable inquiry at the outset of litigation in order 12 to determine whether to refer a case to arbitration in 13 the first place, and it's unnecessary because State law 14 unconscionability, can deal with contracts of adhesion 15 or unfair terms. The arbitrator in the first instance 16 can deal with how to cost effectively arbitrate the 17 claims in issue. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did -- did American 19 Express say, as Justice Breyer suggested, that, well we 20 will concede A, B, and C, so the only issue on which you 21 need proof is D? As I understood it, American Express 22 never took the position that it would -- it would 23 concede certain issues so that you could limit the 24 proof. 25 MR. KELLOGG: Well, Your Honor, we took the
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 position even in district court that they could pool 2 their resources -3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I'm not 4 talking about -5 MR. KELLOGG: -- and share the cost of the 6 claim. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not talking about 8 pooling with other single merchants bringing single 9 arbitrations. I'm asking whether American Express -- so 10 here's the complaint. It says, I have to prove relevant 11 markets separately. And did American Express take the 12 position, no, you don't have to prove all that. I think 13 that's what Justice Breyer was suggesting. There's only 14 one thing that's really in controversy, and the rest we 15 could stipulate. 16 But I didn't see anything in all the time 17 this case has been in the courts on American Express's 18 part to say that we are not going to demand the 19 full breadth of proof. 20 MR. KELLOGG: Well, that's -- that's not 21 actually correct. We did not say that we're going to 22 relieve them of their burden of proof on any issues, but 23 we did say, and the district court agreed with us, that 24 the arbitrators are capable of dealing with these claims 25 in an efficient and cost-effective way that would allow
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the plaintiffs to bring them. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose that American 3 Express wouldn't have had to agree to arbitration at 4 all, right? They could have just said -- you know, 5 you -- you have a cause of action, you sue us in court, 6 right? They could say that, legally, couldn't they? 7 MR. KELLOGG: We could. And indeed -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: And until Rule 23 was 9 adopted, that would mean -- you know, if you had a small 10 claim, tough luck, right? De minimis non curate lex. 11 If it's just negligible, it's impracticable for you to 12 bring a Federal claim. And that would not violate the 13 Sherman Act, would it? 14 MR. KELLOGG: Correct. That -- that very 15 issue was present in the Eisen case. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm a little 17 confused about this business about pooling resources and 18 whether it's prohibited or permitted. Tell me exactly 19 what your position is on that. 20 MR. KELLOGG: Our position is that multiple 21 claimants in arbitration could share the costs of an 22 expert for preparation of a report. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it seems to 24 me -- I don't see how that concession is at all needed 25 by the other side. I mean, let's just say they have a
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 trade association or something. They -- they can all 2 get together and say we want to prepare an antitrust 3 expert report about what American Express is doing, and 4 they do, and then presumably, one of them can use it in 5 the arbitration. Any problem with that? 6 MR. KELLOGG: That -- no problem with that, 7 and that's absolutely right. But the plaintiffs below 8 said that wasn't good enough. They said, we need the 9 aggregate damages provided in a class action to make 10 this worthwhile because if we're just going to 11 essentially get costs -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they could borrow the 13 money from a lawyer instead of from the trade 14 association, right? 15 MR. KELLOGG: Well, or from a hedge fund, 16 which increasingly finances litigation. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, again, that 18 doesn't seem too difficult. You either have your trade 19 association or you have a big meeting of all them and 20 say we need to pay for this expert report and once we've 21 got it -- you know, I'm going to represent each of you 22 individually in individual arbitrations and I'm going to 23 win the first one, and then the others are going to fall 24 into place and they'll get a settlement from American 25 Express that's going to be -- satisfy their concerns.

Just a follow-up one, briefly. Is the -- is 10 there collateral estoppel effect in the arbitration that 11 would be applied to subsequent -12 MR. KELLOGG: That is unclear. I have tried 13 to look at that issue. You know, even in court, 14 non-mutual use of offensive collateral estoppel is 15 sometimes at the discretion of court. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 17 MR. KELLOGG: I couldn't find anything in 18 the arbitration contract. 19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Just to be sure I understand 20 it, that you're saying that it does not violate the 21 confidentiality agreement of this clause to -- to all 22 get together and produce one report? 23 MR. KELLOGG: Correct. 24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. 25 MR. KELLOGG: And if you look at actually

Because 8 clearly, the court below thought that the 9 confidentiality clause did sweep so widely as to prevent 10 this. 11 MR. KELLOGG: The Second Circuit did say 12 that after we suggested that they could pool resources. 13 And we think that was an indication of the Court's, 14 shall we say, urgency to strike down the class action 15 waiver. 16 Nobody challenged the confidentiality 17 provision below. 18 JUSTICE KAGAN: So but you're saying the 19 confidentiality position would not apply in that 20 circumstance. 21 MR. KELLOGG: It would not apply. We took 22 that position below. 23 If I might reserve the remainder of my time? 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 25 Mr. Clement?

1 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 2 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 3 MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 4 please the Court: 5 This case is about the scope and continuing 6 existence of a doctrine that has been a feature of this 7 Court's cases and a necessary corollary of its 8 willingness to extend arbitration to Federal statutory 9 claims, the vindication of rights doctrine. 10 Ever since this Court 30 years ago, roughly, 11 got in the business of extending arbitration to Federal 12 statutory claims, it's used the effective vindication 13 doctrine as an assurance that Federal statutory claims 14 would not go unvindicated just because of the arbitral 15 forum. 16 And so, if you look at this Court's cases, 17 they stand for a simple proposition. When the choice is 18 arbitration or litigation, surely the FAA favors 19 arbitration and it's no threat to the underlying 20 statute because the underlying statutory claim is 21 vindicated in the arbitral forum. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see -- I don't see 23 how a Federal statute is frustrated or is unable to be 24 vindicated if it's too expensive to bring a Federal 25 suit. That happened for years before there was such a
24

Alderson Reporting Company

1 thing as class action in Federal courts. Nobody thought 2 the Sherman Act was a dead letter, that it couldn't be 3 vindicated. 4 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, let me 5 take -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I don't see why it's 7 any different when you transpose the situation to the -8 to the arbitration situation. 9 MR. CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, let me take on 10 the premise and then we get -- then also say where 11 really the concern comes in for the differential 12 treatment. 13 I would take issue with the premise, which 14 is, sure, there wasn't a Sherman Act -- there wasn't a 15 class action Rule 23 back when the Sherman Act was first 16 passed. But there were procedures in like joinder that 17 allowed for multiple claims to be litigated together; 18 there were not confidentiality agreements that came in 19 and limited your ability to share information from one 20 claim to another, and, of course, back in the good old 21 days, you didn't necessarily need a $300,000 expert to 22 bring a Sherman Act claim. 23 But what I think is the problem is when you 24 have a difference, and that is the assumption on which 25 this case comes to the Court, where you could vindicate
25

Alderson Reporting Company

1 this claim in court because there are mechanisms to 2 share or shift costs and you cannot vindicate them in 3 the arbitration because of a combination of features of 4 the arbitration agreement that prevent any sharing or 5 shifting of costs. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Before you get to that, I 7 have two questions. One is on the point you've just 8 made because I -- I agree, I understand it is fairly 9 well established, this doctrine, but I don't see quite 10 how it works. 11 Suppose there's a Tyler claim, a Truth in 12 Lending Act -- you know, something like that, and the 13 claim is a fairly -- it's worth about $10,000 or so. 14 And so the plaintiff says you violated the act, pay me 15 the $10,000. Now, he happens to come up with a theory 16 that is really far out; and the more far out the theory, 17 the harder it is to prove. And the harder it is to 18 prove, the more you need expensive experts. 19 And do we go case by case, saying -- you 20 know, where you have a really weird theory that's going to 21 require 17 experts and endless studies, you don't have 22 to have an arbitration claim, or you don't have to 23 follow it in this instance, but everybody else does. 24 Now -- now, is -- is that something, in 25 other words, we're supposed to look at case by case,
26

1 which would produce the odd result I suggested? Or do 2 we do it by categories? How does the doctrine work? 3 MR. CLEMENT: Well, you could do it by 4 category, and I suppose you could treat antitrust claims 5 differently, but I think there's an answer that's 6 already built into the Court's cases, which is Randolph, 7 and it's putting the burden on the plaintiff to make a 8 nonspeculative showing. 9 And in the case you've described, I would 10 think you would say, boy, that's speculative. I mean -11 you know, you don't need that -12 JUSTICE BREYER: No, what I'll do because I 13 work with my own hypothetical, I'll have a far-out case, 14 but yet not quite speculative. In other words, what I'm 15 trying to suggest is it's an odd doctrine that just 16 says, plaintiff by plaintiff, you can ignore an 17 arbitration clause if you can get a case that's 18 expensive enough, and there we are. 19 I haven't seen it work, and I haven't seen 20 enough to know how it does work. And I guess you 21 haven't either, but -- but I'm concerned about that. 22 MR. CLEMENT: Well -- well, don't be too 23 concerned, Justice Breyer. First of all, if you look at 24 the cases where the doctrine's been applied, it's 25 largely been in antitrust cases. The First Circuit
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Kristian case is an antitrust case. And I don't think 2 that's an accident. 3 I mean, if you look at the Hovenkamp amicus 4 brief, it make clear that you just can't bring this type 5 of claim without an expert -6 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that doesn't seem right to 7 me. Now, Hovenkamp would be the person I would hire as 8 the arbitrator. So surely he does know -- or Phil 9 Arita -- a blessed memory. And they're under the 10 instruction to get this done cheap. Well, I think that 11 might be possible. 12 That might be possible because it's only the 13 question of damages that's tough here because if you 14 don't have the double -- there's only one monopoly 15 profit at the two levels, da, da, da, and we don't need 16 to go through that. 17 But I can think of a way of getting it done 18 pretty cheap. But regardless, your expert here didn't 19 talk about the cost of arbitration. He did use the word 20 once. But as I read pages 88 through 92, it seemed to 21 me he was talking about the cost of litigation, not the 22 cost of arbitration. And -- and I wouldn't proceed 23 necessarily with all those reports he does to impress to 24 the jury, or even the judge. 25 This is Phil Arita. You don't need to
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 impress him. And -- so, so, so -- hasn't the Second 2 Circuit looked, assuming your doctrine's in place, to 3 the wrong set of costs: The cost of litigation? Even 4 though they use the word "arbitration," that isn't what 5 your expert told me. 6 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I mean, Justice Breyer, 7 none of us can know for sure what Professor Arita would 8 say. But we know what Professor Hovenkamp says, and he 9 says to bring these claims you need an expert. Now, 10 in -11 JUSTICE BREYER: In arbitration or in court? 12 MR. CLEMENT: He says in arbitration or 13 anywhere. He assumes that anywhere you bring these 14 claims, you're going to need a market power expert. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Does he take into account 16 the fact that the arbitrator can be him? And moreover, 17 could, in fact, work under an instruction keep these 18 costs down? 19 MR. CLEMENT: And what I would say, 20 Justice Breyer, is the place for that debate, if it were 21 going to take place, was in the district court. Because 22 we made our case, as Randolph requires -- and it was a 23 nonspeculative case. We said it's going to cost 24 $300,000 to $500,000 or even a million dollars to get a 25 market power expert. They didn't come back and say, no,
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 in arbitration, I think you can do it for 50,000. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: No, that isn't the point. 3 If I were doing this offhand, I would say everything is 4 conceded, but for one thing: Since there is no double 5 monopoly power, there is only one monopoly power at the 6 two levels which can be exercised, the only way the 7 person is damaged is if in fact you've raised entry 8 barriers. So you'd say to the plaintiff, how are you 9 going to prove that? And you'd read it and submit a 10 report. 11 Now, I'm not saying this is the right way to 12 go about it. All I'm saying is it's hard for me to 13 figure out on the basis of that affidavit, which talks 14 about courts, why this has to be so expensive. So what 15 do I do? 16 MR. CLEMENT: I think what you do is you, 17 with all due respect, fault Petitioners for that. 18 Because we put in that report -- they could have 19 criticized it exactly the way you are and we'd have a 20 different case. But they argued before the district 21 court and the court of appeals just what they argued to 22 you, Justice Kennedy, it doesn't matter if you can do 23 it. 24 It doesn't matter if it's too expensive. We 25 don't think this doctrine exists, or we don't think it

1 extends to this kind of cases, and having put their -2 their money on that extreme position that the effective 3 vindication doctrine doesn't exist, I think it's -4 JUSTICE BREYER: One other thing which I 5 didn't understand, and that's why I am asking. What 6 they chose as the remedy here was sever the arbitration 7 clause if you want, it seemed to be, and go to court. 8 All right. 9 Now, I don't know where that power comes 10 from. So if you were going to improve this contract in 11 the direction that you would like, why couldn't you 12 sever the part about the confidentiality, or why 13 couldn't you require -- you have some awfully big 14 merchants. 15 Like, I don't know -- probably, you have 16 maybe Costco, maybe Walmart, maybe -- you know, these 17 people are not without money. Though your client, 18 may be. But -- go get these contributions. Go for -19 there are many ways you can treat this particular set of 20 words in the arbitration clause, short of severing it 21 entirely. 22 And -- and what about that? What's your 23 view on that? What do you think? 24 MR. CLEMENT: Well, our -- our view on that 25 is -- you know, the Court is balancing two things here.
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 It's trying to apply the effective vindication doctrine, 2 but it's also trying to honor the principle of this 3 Court that you treat the parties to the bargain that 4 they have committed. 5 Now, if they would have come in and said in 6 the district court -- which they didn't -- that we'll 7 get rid of the confidentiality -- they said you could 8 share costs, but they -- you know, the confidentiality 9 was the problem. 10 It was the problem the Second Circuit saw. 11 You can look at 92a of the Petition appendix. And they 12 didn't petition on that issue, so I don't know how they 13 get to say, well, the Second Circuit was wrong about 14 that, but isn't that a shame. I mean, if they thought 15 that was wrong, they should have petitioned. 16 And that just shows you, these issues were 17 in front of the Court. Now -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you -- I don't 19 understand. You think they could have appealed on 20 that -- on that issue? 21 MR. CLEMENT: Sure. I don't think this 22 Court would have necessarily granted it because it's not 23 very cert-worthy. But it's also -- I don't know how 24 they can keep that issue in their back pocket and then 25 say well, we got cert -- we got cert on the cert-worthy
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 issue and now we have this factual finding where the 2 Second Circuit held that the confidentiality agreement 3 precludes the sharing of this information from 4 arbitration to arbitration. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me ask you. Your 6 effective vindicability principle depends upon a 7 comparison with what you could do in Court. 8 MR. CLEMENT: It doesn't, Justice Scalia. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't? 10 MR. CLEMENT: It doesn't. It's a simple 11 comparison of the necessary unrecoupable costs of 12 bringing the claim in arbitration compared to the 13 maximum recovery. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but if you couldn't do 15 it -- if you couldn't do it either -- even if there had 16 been no arbitration agreement, how could the arbitration 17 agreement be -- be harming you? I don't understand 18 that. 19 MR. CLEMENT: If you have -- if you have a 20 claim, Justice Scalia, that can't be vindicated in 21 arbitration or in court, that claim's not going -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or in court. 23 MR. CLEMENT: Right. But that's -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: You have to compare it to 25 court.
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. CLEMENT: No you don't. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you couldn't do it in 3 court, you don't have to be able to do it in 4 arbitration, it seems to me. 5 MR. CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Scalia, 6 you don't have to make that comparison part of the 7 test because the cases that can't be vindicated in 8 either place won't show up at the courthouse door. So 9 once you show up at the courthouse door, you've got a 10 plaintiff's lawyer. They may be crazy, but you have a 11 plaintiff's lawyer that thinks I can do this in the 12 litigation system. 13 And so at that point, the only question is, 14 all right, I think I can do this in the litigation 15 system. If the only thing that's precluding me from 16 doing it is this arbitration agreement -- so this 17 arbitration agreement is not operating as a real 18 arbitration agreement, it's operating as a de facto 19 as-applied exculpatory clause. If they can make that 20 showing, then -- and the option is not arbitration or 21 litigation -22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. It's saying that 23 there's an alternate mechanism for resolving disputes. 24 It's called arbitration. And arbitration does not 25 necessarily or even as a matter of fact often as a
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 practical matter involve the costs and the formalities of 2 litigation. 3 MR. CLEMENT: And -- and God bless it, 4 Justice Kennedy -- when it does that, and it can 5 effectively address claims that can't be addressed in 6 the litigation system, that's exactly what we want 7 arbitration to do. 8 But there are some cases where the 9 arbitration system -- not generally -- I mean, if you 10 have the kind of pro-vindication agreement you had in 11 Concepcion, or that Sovereign Bank has that we mentioned 12 in our brief, then you can vindicate these claims in 13 arbitration. 14 But when you have a specific arbitration 15 agreement that has a variety of clauses that don't allow 16 for any mechanism to shift or share the costs, so you 17 know it's not litigation versus arbitration, of course 18 we'll go with arbitration. It's litigation or nothing. 19 In those circumstances, this Court has always said that 20 we'll have -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean maybe it is 22 litigation if you need a $300,000 report. But why do 23 you need a $300,000 report? That's what we're asking. 24 And I just can't -- it seems to me that I have to engage 25 in speculation about the limits of arbitration in order
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to resolve in your favor. 2 Now, to be sure, they took a -- a more rigid 3 view below, so we don't have much of a record. 4 MR. CLEMENT: Well -- and, Justice Kennedy, 5 I would say that -- I mean, shame on them, with all due 6 respect. Because there was an opportunity in the 7 district court to make an apples to apples comparison, 8 and they could have said, no, $300,000 is way off; you 9 can do this for $25,000, and here's how. But they 10 didn't make that showing. They said -- you know, we 11 don't think the effective vindication doctrine applies 12 in these circumstances at all. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a little much 14 to expect them to come back and say, oh no, no, no, you 15 don't have to prove all this. The only thing you've got 16 to prove is it's going to cost you $25,000. That's an 17 odd position to put them in. 18 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't think it is, 19 Mr. Chief Justice. I -- they don't have to say -- you 20 know -- they don't have to tell us how to prove our case 21 to the lowest possible price. They just have to show us 22 something that will allow us to vindicate our claim -23 JUSTICE BREYER: There is no authority that 24 I could find for the prop -- I mean, if in fact it costs 25 you $10,000 to buy the arbitrator -- system -- you know,
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 you buy the system -2 (Laughter.) 3 JUSTICE BREYER: Sorry. But I mean -- you 4 know, hire -- whatever it is, if those are obstacles, 5 it's pretty well established, I think, that that 6 arbitration is not something that you can use to 7 vindicate the Federal claim. And the part that's 8 bothering me about this, though, is that those aren't 9 obstacles. 10 It's just you brought a very expensive 11 claim. And the real problem here is the reason they can 12 go into court is they can get a class action in court. 13 And then this Court has said, you can't get the class 14 action in arbitration. There we have it. 15 So -- so the -- the question in my mind is, 16 well, is there a way that some of the beneficial aspects 17 of class action can be used in an arbitration that does 18 not formally have a class action? And there it seems 19 yours is a good case because a lot of them can. You 20 say, well, the one part that can't is getting this 21 private information. 22 So maybe we should send it back and say, 23 well, why do you need the private information? On a 24 good theory of antitrust, you're going to show that the 25 price of the Tide product was higher than what it would

1 have been had the entry barriers not been raised from 2 the Tide. That's a general entry question, which I 3 don't think you need private information from them to 4 answer. But that's -- and now we're really into the 5 depths of the merits. 6 So I thought of sending it back and saying, 7 let's -- let them explore this kind of thing about other 8 ways of trying to get some of these advantages of class 9 action into your -- you're going to say I'm too far out 10 on this. 11 MR. CLEMENT: Well, what I'm going to say, 12 Justice -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: They could write a treatise 14 on it, maybe. 15 MR. CLEMENT: But -- but what I was going to 16 say is look, I mean, take a step back. You know, one of 17 the great things about the effective vindication 18 doctrine is it gets the incentives rights. It gives 19 companies incentives to draft clauses that will allow 20 for the maximum vindication of Federal rights. 21 And so there are lots of clauses out there 22 that would allow for even this claim because they have 23 cost shifting of expert costs or they don't have 24 confidentiality agreements or they'll waive the 25 confidentiality -
38

Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose this class could 2 not -- could not qualify for certification in Federal 3 court. Are you asserting that there is some arbitration 4 principle that -- that allows you to create some new 5 class? 6 MR. CLEMENT: No, Justice Scalia. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you have to make -- you 8 have to make a comparison to what can be done in Federal 9 court, don't you? 10 MR. CLEMENT: No, it's not part of the 11 inquiry because -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't. So that any 13 class that the arbitrator thinks is okay is required. 14 MR. CLEMENT: No, it's just that if by virtue 15 of showing up in court and saying, I want to litigate my 16 claim, the lawyer has already made a judgment that I can 17 vindicate it in Federal court. 18 Maybe it's because of class action, maybe 19 it's just because of joinder, maybe it's because there's 20 no confidentiality rule in the Federal proceedings, so 21 it can bring a lot of these claims, maybe it's a 22 difference in collateral estoppel. Whatever it is, that 23 lawyer has already spoken that I can make this claim 24 work in litigation. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: But he wants a class. What
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 he wants in the arbitration is the ability to sue on behalf 2 of a class, doesn't he? 3 MR. CLEMENT: That might be what they most 4 want, but they don't get that. They just get some way 5 to vindicate the claim. And if this had a cost-shifting 6 provisions that the expert costs were shifted, that 7 would get the job done, that's the Sovereign Bank 8 example we talked about in our brief. There are more 9 than one way. We're not trying to get a guarantee for 10 class treatment in one form or the other. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is that what you 12 asked for below, anything, class action or compensation 13 or whatever? 14 MR. CLEMENT: We -- in fairness, we focused 15 below on the class action because that's -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought. 17 That's what I thought this case was about. What's the 18 question presented anyway? 19 MR. CLEMENT: Well, don't just look at the 20 question presented, look at the opinion below. And look 21 at 91(A) and 92(A). The questions that the Second 22 Circuit addressed -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Whether -- whether the 24 Federal Arbitration Act permits courts invoking the 25 Federal substantive law of arbitrability to invalidate
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 arbitration agreements on the ground that they do not 2 permit class arbitration of a Federal law claim. 3 Now, you're saying that -- that whether they 4 permit class arbitration is not going to be decided on 5 the basis of whether you could certify a class under 6 Rule 23, but just what? 7 And -- and -- and if it does depend on that, 8 what is the Court supposed to do? Before it can -- it 9 can give you your claim, it has to -- it has to decide 10 whether this class would be certifiable, wouldn't it? 11 My goodness -12 MR. CLEMENT: No, it would not -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- this is a very 14 complicated procedure. 15 MR. CLEMENT: -- Your Honor. You just have 16 to answer the question, is there a problem with the 17 arbitration, is there something with this specific 18 agreement that precludes this claim going forward. Here 19 it's a combination of no class arbitration, no way to 20 shift costs because they don't provide cost shifting, 21 and no way to share costs because of the 22 confidentiality. 23 Whatever they put in the question presented, 24 they can't make the Second Circuit's holding that the 25 confidentiality provision blocks the sharing of
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 information to go away. They're stuck with that. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is -- tell me 3 how the no -- no sharing of information and 4 confidentiality, how does that work again? You can't, 5 if you're a trade association, get together and say, I 6 think we should have a study of Amex's whatever. And 7 then you put together the study, and then one of your 8 members says -- you know, that's a good study, I'm going 9 to go -- go to arbitration. They can't do that? 10 MR. CLEMENT: They -- they could do that 11 much, Mr. Chief Justice. The critical point at which 12 the confidentiality provision creates a practical 13 problem is you're trying to get all the information, 14 you're trying to get a single expert report in order to 15 share the costs, and you're trying to do not just the 16 market survey, but do a damage calculation, have a 17 damage formula. 18 Because when you have a market like this 19 where the allegations are they've distorted the market, 20 so we can't rely on the market price, we need to know 21 the sales volumes of all the individual stores. Their 22 confidentiality agreement protects that and doesn't 23 allow that to be shared. That's not that unusual. 24 This Court in Nielsen and Concepcion both 25 remarked that one of the features of arbitration is you
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 generally keep it confidential. And that's something 2 that the Second Circuit said because of that -3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if you 4 do -- I mean, what if you do it, is that just part of 5 your trade associations, they think this is -- you know, 6 they're not talking about particular arbitration or 7 anything. They just prepare a -- a report, and then 8 once you see the report, you say, my gosh, I had no 9 idea, and then you file your claim for arbitration. 10 MR. CLEMENT: With all due respect, Mr. -11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me my 12 point is simply that there's no sharing, confidence, it 13 seems like an awfully amorphous provision that would be 14 very difficult to enforce. 15 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I mean, I don't think 16 it's that difficult, Mr. Chief Justice. Certainly, cost 17 shifting is not difficult, and there are other ways to 18 solve this problem. But the Amex agreement forecloses 19 all of them. 20 And the question for this Court is, do you 21 say, well, tough or do you say what you've said every 22 time you've confronted this problem, the effective 23 vindication doctrine provides the solution. 24 Thank you. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll afford you

1 some rebuttal time. 2 Mr. Stewart? 3 Oh, no, we won't. 4 (Laughter.) 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: You should have said, "I 6 accept," very quickly. 7 (Laughter.) 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just being generous 9 this morning. 10 Mr. Stewart? 11 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. MALCOLM L. STEWART, 12 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 13 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS 14 MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 15 please the Court: 16 At the beginning of the argument, 17 Justice Kagan asked whether a pure exculpatory clause, a 18 provision in a contract that simply said, we promise not 19 to seek relief under the arbitration -- under the 20 antitrust clause period would be enforceable, and 21 Mr. Kellogg replied that it would not. 22 And I think the unenforceability of such a 23 provision would not depend on any analysis of what was 24 likely to happen if the suit was brought in court; that 25 is, a pure exculpatory clause could be set aside and the
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 plaintiff could still lose for any number of reasons. 2 The plaintiff could be denied class certification and 3 decide it's uneconomical to proceed with an individual 4 suit. 5 He could lose on a threshold ground like the 6 statute of limitations or he could lose on the merits. 7 But the unenforceability of the pure exculpatory clause 8 wouldn't require the Court to make a comparison between 9 being kicked out of court on that basis and what would 10 likely happen if the suit were able to be brought. 11 And we would submit that the same mode of 12 analysis applies when the arbitration agreement can be 13 shown to have the same practical effect as an 14 exculpatory clause; that is, if it is the case that 15 given the amount of money at stake, the arbitration 16 procedure specified in the contract and the modes of 17 proof that would be necessary in arbitration, if it can 18 be shown persuasively by the plaintiff who bears the 19 burden that no reasonable plaintiff would find it 20 economically feasible to proceed, then the arbitration 21 agreement can't be enforced -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would that be the case even 23 before Rule 23 was -- was adopted? 24 MR. STEWART: Yes. And it would be -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though you couldn't
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 vindicate it in the Federal courts, you must be able to 2 vindicate it in arbitration? 3 MR. STEWART: The question would be whether 4 the arbitration agreement could be enforced. 5 And before Rule 23 was adopted, if there had 6 been a pure exculpatory clause, it would have been 7 unenforceable and -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not even talking about 9 a pure exculpatory clause. I'm talking about the mere 10 fact that as a practical matter, it's impossible to 11 bring it in arbitration. In a context in which it is 12 also impossible to bring it in Federal court. 13 And you would say, still, you must permit it 14 to be brought in arbitration, even though it can't be 15 brought in Federal court. 16 MR. STEWART: In the same way that we would 17 say a pure exculpatory clause would be invalid and 18 unenforceable, even if it were clear from the 19 plaintiff's complaint that he was not entitled to relief 20 on the merits. 21 JUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. -- Mr. Stewart, 22 isn't that also consistent with the way the Court 23 addressed the issue in Randolph? Because what the Court 24 said there was it might be that these arbitration fees 25 are prohibitive. And if those arbitration fees are
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 prohibitive, then this doctrine kicks in. 2 And it didn't look to say, well, let's 3 compare how these fees relate to whatever costs you 4 would wind up with in litigation. It just said, if the 5 arbitration fees are prohibitive, in such -- in such a 6 manner that it prevents you from vindicating your 7 Federal claim in arbitration, that's enough. 8 MR. STEWART: That's correct. And I would 9 make two real world -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what are the 11 arbitration fees? It's not -- not -- not lawyers' fees. 12 Do they include lawyers' fees? 13 MR. STEWART: No, the attorneys' fees would 14 be recoupable under the substantive law. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So I don't know, 16 what do you -17 JUSTICE BREYER: Expert costs. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: So what are you comparing 19 it to in court litigation? 20 MR. STEWART: We are not really -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: A filing fee? 22 MR. STEWART: No, I think we are not 23 comparing it to anything. That is, our -- our position 24 is in determining whether the arbitration agreement has 25 the same practical effect as an exculpatory clause, we
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 asked could any reasonable plaintiff proceed under the 2 terms and conditions that are set up? And if the answer 3 to that is no, then the arbitration agreement is 4 unenforceable. 5 Now, I would make two real-world points, one 6 of which Mr. Clement has already alluded to. The first 7 is the only cases that are going to wind up in court are 8 those in which the plaintiff at least believes that it 9 would be feasible to vindicate the claim in court, and 10 so they are likely to be those in which there is at least a 11 potential difference between the outcome in court and 12 the outcome in arbitration. 13 The other is, even if a plaintiff believes 14 wrongly that he can proceed in court through a class 15 action mechanism and class action -- class certification 16 is denied under Rule 23, presumably at that point the 17 plaintiff is going to give up and the outcome at the end 18 of the day is going to be the same as if the arbitration 19 agreement had been enforced. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: This is exactly -- I found 21 no authority for the proposition that what hinders -22 plenty of authority, you can't make the person go to 23 arbitration if the fees involved are too high because 24 he's blocked. 25 But you're quite an advance over that. You
48

Alderson Reporting Company

1 are saying the thing that keeps him out is his own 2 theory of wrong, which will involve hiring a lot of 3 experts and others. 4 Now, once that's adopted, it seems to me in 5 practice we have reversed in many, many cases the 6 proposition that you can, in fact, require Federal 7 causes of action to be arbitrated because all you have 8 to do to get -- out of the arbitration is to allege a 9 theory of your case which is hard and complicated to 10 prove. Now, you are back in court. 11 Now, that's a significant erosion, it seems 12 to me. So I want to know if you have any standard 13 there, if we're just supposed to accept that, if in fact 14 you are trying to reverse in practice what was the 15 holding that you can arbitrate these Federal causes of 16 action. What is going on here? 17 And an addendum to that is if you are going 18 to convince me, which you might, that, well, that's 19 okay, do it, do it, do it, is it a possible remedy to 20 monkey with the arbitration clause and provide for a 21 sharing of costs, say if you win, the loser will pay the 22 expert fees, which is of course a much more 23 pro-arbitration way than just throwing it out entirely? 24 MR. STEWART: Well, let me start -25 JUSTICE BREYER: That's a long question, but
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 do you see what I'm driving at? 2 MR. STEWART: Let me start with your last 3 question and work backwards. It is possible and it 4 sometimes has happened in the lower court cases that a 5 plaintiff will come into court and say, I can't proceed 6 through arbitration because the arbitral fees are too 7 high in relation to my likely recovery. 8 And the defendant at that point will say, we 9 offer to waive the fees or we offer to pay your share of 10 the arbitral fees, and a court will be persuaded that, 11 given that consensual modification of the contract, it 12 is feasible for the claims to be brought in arbitration 13 and the plaintiff is kicked out of court. 14 Now, this is consensual. This is something 15 that the court has -- that the court has done at the 16 company's behest, and it would be different question of 17 whether the court could do that over the company's 18 objection. But another thing that the company could do 19 is put in a severability clause in the contract that 20 would specify what results should obtain if one 21 provision of the contract were held to be invalid. 22 I guess another thing I would say in 23 response to your question is we do have one data point, 24 the First Circuit's decision in Kristian, which I 25 believe Mr. Clement referred to, in 2006, which
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 essentially held on facts similar to these that the 2 arbitration clause as written was not enforceable 3 because the cost of the expert fees in an antitrust case 4 would dwarf any potential recovery, and we haven't seen 5 the floodgates opened. 6 The last thing I would say is if this is the 7 concern, Petitioner's proposed rule really doesn't match 8 the argument in its favor. That is, Petitioner is not 9 just arguing for a rule that would cover cases in which 10 the relevant costs are those of experts or similar 11 authorities. 12 Petitioner's rule would say even if the 13 contract provides for a non-recoupable $500 filing fee 14 and the amount of the claim at stake is $200, so it's 15 absolutely apparent on the face of the contract that the 16 claim can't be brought, the agreement is still 17 enforceable and the plaintiff is deprived of his day in 18 court. 19 The other thing I would say about 20 Petitioner's argument is the challenge to the Second 21 Circuit's decision has really changed drastically since 22 the cert petition was filed; that is, the Second Circuit 23 took it as essentially undisputed that the costs of the 24 expert report would render it economically infeasible to 25 proceed in arbitration, and it took the further step of
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 saying, therefore the arbitration agreement is 2 unenforceable. 3 Now, the cert petition challenged only the 4 "therefore" part of the Second Circuit's analysis. 5 There wasn't a suggestion that the Petitioner intended 6 to challenge the antecedent determination that these 7 claims couldn't feasibly have been brought in 8 individualized proceedings. 9 And I think as Paul -- Mr. Clement said, the 10 likely reason is that wouldn't look like a cert-worthy 11 issue. That sort of fact-specific inquiry wouldn't seem 12 like a wise use of this Court's resources. 13 So having gotten cert granted on the 14 important legal question whether the inefficacy of 15 arbitration procedures is a basis for invalidating the 16 agreement, Petitioners are now spending a great deal of 17 time arguing that it would in fact have been feasible to 18 pursue these claims through individualized arbitration. 19 And one thing we would say in response, as 20 Mr. Clement said -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. They didn't get 22 cert granted on that question at all. As I pointed out 23 before, they got it granted on whether the mere fact 24 that the arbitration agreement did not permit class 25 arbitration renders it invalid.

1 MR. STEWART: But they did get cert -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought the 3 question before us. 4 MR. STEWART: They got cert granted on that 5 question, but neither the question as so framed or the 6 body of the cert petition suggests any challenge to the 7 Second Circuit's factual determination that these claims 8 could not feasibly have been brought in individualized 9 arbitration. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stewart, is it -- the 11 arbitration agreement is a one-on-one, right? They 12 can't, or can they have -- they have the 12 similarly 13 situated people, not a class, join in the arbitration, 14 or is it one on one? 15 MR. STEWART: That's correct. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which is correct? 17 MR. STEWART: It is correct that it has to 18 be one on one, that the agreement requires only -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And even in the days 20 before we had Rule 23, when you were bringing a suit in 21 Federal court you could have multiple plaintiffs joining 22 together. 23 MR. STEWART: That's correct. The agreement 24 prohibits even the types of joinder mechanisms that 25 might have been available when the Sherman Act was

1 passed. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 3 Mr. Kellogg, you have rebuttal time, 6 4 minutes. 5 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL KELLOGG 6 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS 7 MR. KELLOGG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 8 Let me focus on what the court of appeals 9 held below. At 3a of our appendix, the court said. 10 "The only issue before us is the narrow question of 11 whether the class action waiver provision contained in 12 the contract between the parties should be enforced." 13 That is the question on which we sought certiorari. 14 That is the question that the Court granted. 15 It is Respondents who have now tried to 16 rewrite that question by talking about other possible 17 ways of vindicating their rights that they claim are 18 foreclosed, that they claim wrongly are foreclosed by 19 the contract at issue here. 20 This is not -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do we have a factual 22 record? Suppose, I think, based in substantial part on 23 Justice Breyer's suggestion, that we could have an 24 arbitration that's effective and we could have a trade 25 association prepare a report, and we could do one
54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 arbitration and then see if it applies to others. 2 Suppose I think that. 3 Do I -- doesn't that bear on this question? 4 And if it does, I don't have a factual record to support 5 my assumptions. 6 MR. KELLOGG: I don't think you need a 7 factual record because as Respondents acknowledge the 8 burden is on them to show that the arbitration-specific 9 costs would preclude them from pursuing their claim. 10 And they have not done that by putting in an 11 affidavit saying, well, in litigation we have to do -12 get 5 million documents and spend $300,000 processing 13 them and get an expert report which could cost up to $1 14 million. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: But suppose we answer -16 MR. KELLOGG: That is not -17 JUSTICE BREYER: -- the question -- the 18 answer is yes, a class action waiver can be enforced. 19 MR. KELLOGG: Correct. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what are the 21 circumstances here? The record leaves us uncertain, we 22 remand it for further consideration of what they are. 23 MR. KELLOGG: Well, the court could 24 certainly -25 JUSTICE BREYER: Because that isn't the
55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 issue they decided, whether it could be enforced. They 2 decided whether you can -- whether the whole arbitration 3 agreement could be enforced. 4 MR. KELLOGG: The holding of the court of 5 appeals is the arbitration agreement cannot be enforced 6 because it has a class action waiver. That is clearly 7 reversible error. I don't even hear -8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was because -- it was 9 because Judge Pooler said, "I have been instructed by 10 the Supreme Court that I may not require class 11 arbitration." That's -- and she was bound by our 12 decision that a court can't order class arbitration, 13 isn't that correct? So that was not an option for her. 14 MR. KELLOGG: But the Court also in 15 Concepcion said you can condition the enforceability of 16 an arbitration agreement on the availability of class 17 procedures, and that is what the Court below violated. 18 So the decision below has to be vacated. 19 I do not think you should remand for a 20 detailed factual showing on just how they are going to 21 vindicate their rights in arbitration because most of 22 those questions, what evidence is required, et cetera, 23 are for the arbitrator in the first instance. 24 That said, we made -- we did respond to 25 their showing below. We did not put in a dueling
56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 affidavit saying, no, in litigation, it only requires a 2 $200,000 report or a $25,000 report. We said, that's 3 irrelevant because we're talking about 4 arbitration-specific costs. And there's lots of ways 5 that they can proceed with their claims. 6 One is by sharing the costs of an expert, 7 and they specifically rejected that. They said, even if 8 we could shift the costs of the experts to the other 9 side, that wouldn't be good enough because then all we'd 10 be doing is expending much money to get it back. 11 We need aggregated damages of the sort 12 available in class suit -13 JUSTICE BREYER: Or you have to do without. 14 I -- you just said what -- I thought that the expert 15 talked about litigation costs, not about arbitration 16 costs. 17 So how is that handled? 18 MR. KELLOGG: That is how I read -- that is 19 how I read the report. And certainly with an expert 20 arbitrator -21 JUSTICE BREYER: You said you waived that 22 point, whatever -- however it is. You waived it. Never 23 raised it. The Court of Appeals took it as if it were 24 arbitration costs. 25 MR. KELLOGG: No, we raised -- we've argued
57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that all along. In fact, I can refer the Court to page 2 27 of our -- the -3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Second Circuit never 4 said anything about, this is what it would cost in 5 court. The court -- the Court of Appeals said, this is 6 what it would cost to prove this kind of tying, right? 7 It didn't say one word distinguishing what 8 it would cost in litigation from what it would cost in 9 arbitration. It was simply what it was going to cost. 10 MR. KELLOGG: We did, in fact. But let me 11 answer Justice Breyer's question first, at page 27 of 12 our Court of Appeals -13 JUSTICE BREYER: I believe you. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'd like to hear the 15 answer, if nobody -16 (Laughter.) 17 MR. KELLOGG: We specifically said, "The 18 declaration of merchant's expert is similarly 19 un-illuminating, as he too studiously avoided projecting 20 the costs for an individual arbitration of these 21 disputes." 22 So we did argue against that point. This is 23 not an exculpatory clause. The Court has made clear 24 that a class action waiver is not an exculpatory clause. 25 This Court has also made clear that you cannot assume
58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that the arbitral forum will be inadequate to vindicate 2 Federal substantive rights. 3 And they cannot now change the nature of the 4 question presented by arguing that well, there should 5 have been another provision to allow -- specifically 6 allow cost-sharing, or specifically allow cost-shifting. 7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Kellogg, it does 8 seem like both of the parties have changed what they're 9 saying a bit. And -- you know, if this case as 10 presented to us was presented to us in the first 11 instance that the premise was that if you go into 12 arbitration, it would not provide an effective way to 13 vindicate the claim. 14 And, now, people are saying different things 15 about the confidentiality clause, and people may be 16 saying different things about the necessity of an 17 expert. It suggests that the premise on which this case 18 was presented to us was not quite right. 19 MR. KELLOGG: Well, I -- I don't believe 20 that's the case. The premise on which the Court 21 accepted the case, presumably, is that the decision 22 below which conditioned the enforceability of the 23 arbitration agreement on a -- on the availability of 24 class procedures, was wrong under Concepcion. 25 Therefore -
