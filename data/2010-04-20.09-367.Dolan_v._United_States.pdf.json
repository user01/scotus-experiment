    "speech": "We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-367, Dolan v. United States. Ms. Karlan."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Mandatory Victim Restitution Act makes restitution a mandatory part of a defendant's sentence for certain crimes, and it sets out two paths by which a district court can meet its responsibilities. First, section 3663A(a)(1) authorizes district courts to impose restitution when sentencing a defendant; that is, at the same time that they impose terms of imprisonment, fines, probation, or the like. Second, section 3664(d)(5) of the Act allows final determination of the amount of restitution to occur during a period not to exceed 90 days. Once those periods and the general deadlines for correcting or appealing a sentence have passed, a court's judgment is final, even if it fails to order restitution. In this, the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act is like all other mandatory sentencing provisions, and as this Court confirmed 2 years ago in Greenlaw v. United States, when a court fails to impose a mandatory sentence, that error can be corrected only by following what this Court called the dispositive direction regarding sentencing errors."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Excuse me. Is your argument that if the district court -- for whatever reason, unlikely as it may be -- starts a hearing the day after the rest of the sentence was imposed and has to continue that hearing for 91 days before it can render a judgment --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "No."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "-- that it's now barred from entering that judgment?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "No. If I understand your question correctly, the district court has imposed sentence on day one announcing imprisonment. Any time during the next 90 days, it has a power to set a date and make final determination of the restitution amount. Once that 90-day period has run -- in this case, on October 28th, because the sentencing occurred on July 30th -- the district court loses the authority to impose restitution."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "And the sentence is not final until then?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "That's our position."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "And -- and what if -- what if the court does set a date for additional sentencing? Then it's not final until then, right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "No, Justice Scalia. It would be that once a court has started the sentencing process, it has 90 days within which to complete that process, if it announces at the initial sentencing that it intends to hold open the sentence for final determination of restitution."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "I -- I'm not sure I understood your response to my question. It must impose that restitution order, complete all its proceedings within the 90-day period?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "Yes, that's correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "So it can't hold a hearing over from the 90th day to the 91st day?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "No, it cannot do that. And if it were to do that in a case where restitution were mandatory, the sentence would become final, the government would file an appeal, and that appeal would certainly succeed, because it's plain error not to have to imposed the restitution."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "Your position is that if the court puts off the order of restitution for 90 days, during that period, the defendant cannot take an appeal?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "If the court has announced at the initial sentencing that it intends to do so, no, then it cannot."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "Isn't that dramatically contrary to the way criminal appeals have been handled for a long time? There's a very short period of time for a defendant to file a notice of appeal in a criminal case, and you’re saying that that is dramatically extended by the possibility of -- of restitution later on or by the fact that the restitution order will be entered later?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "No, Justice Alito. What I'm saying is that a defendant can only appeal from a final sentence, and until the restitutionary term is imposed within the time period allowed by the MVRA, there is not a final sentence. Then he has from the time that restitution is --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "Yes, I understand that. But you’re saying the defendant is -- the defendant is incarcerated, let's say; is convicted, is sentenced to prison. The defendant wants to take a quick appeal. The defendant thinks he's going to win on appeal. And you’re saying, well, no, you have to wait 90 days before you can file your notice of appeal?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "I believe that's correct, because he has to have a final judgment before he can appeal."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, what -- what do you do about the further provision that at any time later, if the government -- or the victim finds additional basis for restitution, so long as after discovering it, within 60 days after that, the victim can come to the court and ask for restitution? What does that do? Does that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "I mean, doesn't that necessarily mean that there are indeed two final judgments? That -- that one has to be -- has to go up on its own, doesn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "That's correct, but section 3664(o) of the statute says that the initial restitution amount constitutes a final judgment, even though there can be amendment after it's been entered."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Where is that?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Is there any circuit court who has addressed this issue of when an appeal is timely, in a situation in which a restitution order has not been entered at the initial sentencing?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "Not in precisely that way. There are a couple of cases that are -- that kind of circle around that. So for example, Kapelushnik, which we cite in our petition for certiorari and in our brief as the wisest way of thinking about this, held that once the 90 days has lapsed, the judgment is final by operation of law. There’s an opinion by Judge Posner in the Seventh Circuit that’s not on restitution but on a related issue, which says that if you have several components to the sentence, until that last component is entered, the time for filing an appeal under F.R.A.P. 4 does not begin to run. And that's --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "In this -- when the judge did not enter a date for restitution, did you object to that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "We were not required to do so, so we did not."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, why not? It seems that that's when the violation occurred. The statute said the court shall set a date if they’re not ready to calculate the restitution, and he didn't do that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "Well, that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but the statute doesn't say when he has to set the date. The statute simply says the date has to be set so that final restitution will occur during the period -- and here I quote again from the statute -- \"not to exceed 90 days.\" So he can set that date once he gets the information from --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, I thought it says -- maybe I am misreading it. It says the court -- this is at sentencing. When sentencing -- you look at the previous provision -- what is it? 3663A(a)(1) --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "-- talks about what you do when sentencing it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "And the statute says, “the court shall set a date for the final determination” … “not to exceed 90 days.” And he didn't."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "That's correct, he did not set it. But the statute -- I'm now looking at petition appendix 55a, which is where section 3664(d)(5) of the Act is set out. It says, \"The court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim's losses, not can't really set the date until it receives the information that it hopes to receive from the probation office or from the victim. So that --"

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "No, no, no --"

  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "It can say 90 days. It can say 90 days."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "It -- it could, yes. Or it could say, as the district court did here, I'm going to hold open the date. But it can only hold open that date until the point at which it actually imposes the restitution, within the 90 days."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "This is a -- this is, in one respect, Ms. Karlan, a technical argument, is it not? Because it's true that this defendant, from the probation officer's report, knew within the 90 days what restitution was going to be recommended."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "Yes. He knew within the 90 days what the government's claim was going to be, but the court did not hold the hearing and did not impose the judgment. And so the August 8th judgment became final by operation of law on October 28th, because that was 90 days after the July 30th sentencing. At that point, the government could have filed an appeal in this case, and, quite frankly, they would have won. As it was --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "How is your position -- how is your position consistent with the thrust of the victims’ rights legislation that Congress has enacted in recent years, including the statute that’s before us here? Now, in this case, the victim -- the victim's medical bills were paid by the United States. But that isn't always going to be the case, and sometimes victims are going to have a lot of lost income. So you have the victim, like the victim here, who is beaten to a pulp by a defendant and loses a substantial amount of future income as a result, and you say that if the judge makes a mistake, it's just too bad for the victim. The victim gets nothing because the judge waited too long."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "I don't say that, and I don't think that's what Congress had in mind. First, what Congress had in mind was to strike the balance it struck in this statute, which was to give victims the right to receive restitution as part of a criminal sentence, as long as it was done within 90 days of sentencing. Second, the government can appeal if a court doesn't follow the rules. Third --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "Yes, but wasn't -- wasn't the whole thrust of the victims' rights legislation that up to that point, Congress thought prosecutors were not sufficiently attending to the rights and the interests of victims? They were doing their own prosecutorial thing, but they weren't involving victims, making sure they knew about court proceedings, and so forth. And you’re saying, well, if the court makes a mistake and the prosecution falls down in its responsibility, the person who suffers is the victim who gets victimized again."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "No, that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is Congress struck a balance. They wanted to give restitution to victims. They also wanted final sentencing for defendants. Congress struck that balance by giving a 90-day extension. It didn't provide --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, you’re not really -- you’re not really answering Justice Alito's question. He says he understands that, as I understand the question. We understand that argument. But it doesn't address the fact that the net result of your argument is (a) unfair to the victim and (b) inconsistent with the whole design and thrust of the Victims Act."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "It’s --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",

  },

    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "No, my argument is Congress struck that balance, and in some cases, yes, too bad --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Of course, the same thing would happen if the trial judge makes a mistake of law which causes the -- the defendant to be acquitted, so that he not only escapes the liability to the victim, he escapes any -- any criminal punishment. It happens all the time. The judge makes a mistake; society pays for it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "That's correct, and Congress here has said 90 days. And they meant it. If they had meant to say, at any time, a victim can receive restitution, they would have said that."

And the Department of Transportation fails to do that. It doesn't promulgate its law for 18 months. Is that law invalid? The rule?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "The judge enters a -- an order, a final order. And that final judgment, as was true here, says: I haven't decided restitution yet. He can appeal. Then what it says is when you get around to the restitution, then enter another judgment, and you’ll appeal that, as happens precisely in the case of the 60 days -- you know, that extra stuff that Justice Scalia was referring to. That's a possible interpretation of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. I don't see, you know, the appeals thing. I don't see anything -- I don't have in front of me the language on filing an appeal, but I can't think of anything that’s contrary."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "What’s contrary to that is that the Federal courts of appeals only have jurisdiction to decide cases that come up, in criminal cases, on final judgment or under the collateral order."

    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "No. With all respect, Justice Breyer, there is no provision that says an order of restitution --"

    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "What?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "-- that a sentence that includes a term of restitution can be a final judgment, even though that 60-day provision to which Justice Scalia pointed is on the books. But you can't have a final judgment in a criminal case that involves several different components of a sentence until those aspects of the sentence have actually been imposed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "Well, why isn't the --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "Justice Scalia, I believe, was referring to the 60-day provision."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "Yes, the same problem."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "The 60-day provision is specifically immunized from the final judgment rule by section 3664(o) of the statute. The 90-day provision is not. So until a defendant -- perhaps I could -- perhaps I could use a slightly different example, which is: Suppose a defendant is supposed to be a sentenced to a fine, a mandatory fine --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "JUTICE BREYER",
    "speech": "I see."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "-- and a mandatory prison sentence. If you sentence him to the mandatory prison sentence and say I still need to calculate the fine -- there is no final judgment. He cannot appeal that sentence."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "But isn't there a difference between those two situations? A fine is a criminal penalty. It goes -- it -- the prosecution is brought in the same of the sovereign. The fine goes to the sovereign. It's a traditional criminal penalty. Restitution is not a traditional criminal penalty. It's much like, arguably, attorneys' fees in a civil case. It is -- it is like -- it is really a -- a benefit for the victim. It is not something that inures to the benefit of the sovereign. And so why doesn't it make sense to view that judgment of restitution as a separate judgment, just as the award of an attorney’s fees is a separate final appealable order in a civil case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "Well, because this judgment of restitution is not a civil judgment. It is part of the defendant's criminal punishment, and, therefore, it is not like attorneys' fees, something that’s separate. As we point out in our reply brief, in order to calculate the amount of imprisonment, in order to calculate the fine, the Federal criminal sentencing provisions -- and I should note that section 3664(a) appears in Title 18 in the section under miscellaneous sentencing provisions, not civil provisions. All of those things interact. And so you can't calculate one of those without knowing all of them."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But, functionally, isn't it a substitute for the remedy that the victim of a crime might have? Wasn't what Congress was trying to do was to spare the victim the necessity of suing the defendant and having his kind of civil restitution tacked onto the criminal proceeding?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "That’s certainly Congress's purpose, but they did it within the context of sentencing. So, for example, Justice Ginsburg, if this really were a civil penalty, defendants would not be entitled to the assistance of counsel in challenging the amount of restitution, because the Sixth Amendment would not apply. The dates for filing an appeal would be different. There would be a jurisdictional bar that doesn't exist in criminal cases. This Court said several times that restitution under these kinds of circumstances -- in Hughey, under the predecessor to this Act, and in Kelly v. Robinson -- is a penal statute. Justice Sotomayor in her opinion for the Second Circuit in Varrone said this is a penal statute. So there is no question here that this is a substitute for a civil remedy or a supplement for a civil remedy, but it is a criminal punishment. And Congress has said that you have to order it at sentencing or within 90 days, or else it is error that can be corrected through Rule 35 or by appeal, but not otherwise."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Now, what -- what can the defendant do within that 90 days? He has to wait 90 days before he appeals the sentence that he has been given; is that right?"

  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "That's correct. There is not a final judgment in his case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "That's 3 months that -- that he has to sit on his hands."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "That's correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "Where does it say that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "Well, the final judgment rule says that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "Well, this is a court-made rule of what counts as a final judgment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "Right. And -- and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "All right. Is there anything in the decisions of this Court interpreting that rule? I mean, you could have collateral orders. You could have all kinds of things. And doesn't it boil down to the same question? I mean, I agree with you that if Congress wanted to make a 90-day deadline, you really have to do it, and you can't restitute thereafter. All right. That's one thing. But if they didn't, why didn't they equally intend the judgment without the restitution order to be a final judgment?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "And then later on, just as in (o), if the judge does impose an order of restitution, then of course, that's appealable, and that's a different judgment. Is there -- what in the law prevents the -- that interpretation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "I think two things prevent that interpretation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "One is this Court's precedent, and let me talk about that. And two is a proper reading of section 3664(o). So I’ll turn first to the precedent and then to 3664(o)."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "So you have precedent."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "So the precedent is, for example, this Court said in Parr v. United States, which is cited on page 12 of the reply brief, among other places, that “a judgment or decision is final for purpose of appeal only when it terminates the litigation between the parties on the merits of the case, and leaves nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined.” or probation rather than serving time in prison, a court can take that into account in setting the sentence."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Must take it into account --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "Yes."

    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "-- if you read 3553 the way it's written."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "Yes, I think they must take it into account. Now, whether -- how they’ll actually strike that balance is --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Is there no -- is there no possibility that a judge could say: I want to make this analogous to 54(b) under the civil rules; that is, I don't want to delay the time that the defendant can appeal from the -- from the -- from the sentence. So this order is final, and 3 months later, I’ll take up the question of restitution when all the information is in. The court is prevented from doing that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KARLAN",
    "speech": "I’m unaware of any criminal rules analogue to Rule 54(b) in the civil context, because in general, as I understand the way this Court's precedents have worked, there have been what might look like interlocutory appeals in criminal cases, but they’ve always involved collateral issues. And the problem here, for the reason that Justice Scalia just pointed to, is restitution and the amount of imprisonment are not collateral to one another; that is, they may interact. And a fine certainly isn't, because the statute itself says you can't impose a fine to the extent that it will impair restitution. So if --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "So the judge -- but the of course, could say to the defendant: I'm not going to sentence you; I'm not going to put that sentence -- I'm not going to sentence you at all --"

    "speaker": "KARLAN",

That's what a statute of limitations is. The second kind of time limit is to say you must do something and you must do it within a second -- within a certain amount of time.

There are no finality questions there. What do you do in this situation when you’re dealing with a criminal sentence where there are finality rules?

The defendant has to know at that point, must I appeal that first judgment? Because if I don't, I'll never be able to appeal it. But on your reading, the defendant can't wait. When the judge imposes a sentence, the defendant must meet the time clock for notice of appeal from the sentence."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "HEYTENS",
    "speech": "Well, that would be -- yes. That would be our view, Mr. Chief Justice. Now, what I would say is, it is, first of all, our view that the Court doesn't need to resolve any of this. But, second of all, one of the reasons is there is another way the Court could resolve this, which is to follow the approach the Court took in its decision in Corey v. United States, which is cited in the blue brief. Now, Corey involved a statute. It's presentence -- it's pre-Federal sentencing guidelines. It involves a statute that said if, at the time of the sentencing, the district court feels like it needs more information to decide how long to send the defendant to jail for, it may commit the defendant to the discretion of the Attorney General for a period of either 3 to 6 months; get, essentially, a PSR, before there were PSRs; and then make a determination then. The Court in Corey faced the question: When the district court does that -- it says, I'm going to give you to the Attorney General, and we'll come back in 6 months and decide what your sentence will be -- when does the defendant have to appeal? That was the question before the Court in Corey. What the Court said in Corey is that the defendant may appeal either at the time he is committed to the discretion of the Attorney General or at the time the district court imposes the final sentence. The reason the Court said that -- this is the language that's cited in the blue brief -- is the Court said it would be extraordinary to tell a Federal criminal defendant that he might have to wait up to 6 months in order to take a notice of appeal from his judgment of conviction."

So if (o) applies, when, 8 months later or 20 months later, that restitution is made final and embodied in another judgment, that is a final judgment which can't be appealed. So if you’re right about (o) applying, then the answer to the question is, no, he is not out of luck. Now, don't just agree with me because I seem to be on your side in this question. (Laughter.)"

    "speaker": "HEYTENS",
    "speech": "I apologize, Justice Breyer. The government's position is that at the time the judgment of conviction and the sentence of imprisonment are entered, that is the time at which the defendant has to appeal and, in our view, he may appeal. Later, when the sentence of restitution is imposed, that is when he appeals that. What I was suggesting is that, to the extent the Court has any concern about that, the alternative way of resolving this issue would be the same way the Court approached the issue in Corey, and you could say that the defendant could appeal at either time. Now, we think that would be incorrect, but it would be open to the Court to do so to -- or to leave the issue open in order to resolve this case. Because as I said before, this defendant never attempted to appeal his judgment of conviction or his original term of imprisonment. So it's not, in this case, necessary to decide what exactly would have happened had he attempted to do so."

Ice, the Court, admittedly in dictum, stated that restitution determinations are a category of determinations that have been historically made by the court, not by the jury. And regardless of what anyone thinks is the answer to that question, it is certainly not within the question presented. It has not been raised at any point by the Petitioner in this case."

  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "I suppose that an answer to the Chief Justice's concern about the 1-week sentence and -- and he's not concerned -- is that all criminal defendants know that an adjudication of guilt is preclusive of later issues with -- with respect to civil -- civil liability, and they take their chances. But that -- that points up a difference between this case and Montalvo-Murillo. In this case, finality is central to the system, and that wasn't -- that's not really -- wasn't really true in Montalvo."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HEYTENS",
    "speech": "That's certainly correct, Justice Kennedy. That was by its terms a bail determination, which by its nature is not a final determination in the sense that a criminal statute is, though the Court's language doesn't really suggest that that would make any difference. And I would say that some of the other cases in this same line of cases, including some of the ones Justice Breyer mentioned, did raise finality concerns. There was a very strong finality concern raised in the Peabody Coal case. There were finality concerns raised in Brock, that Congress had said this needs to be done, and once it’s done, it needs to be done. And so, there are -- some of the cases in this same line have also involved finality, admittedly not in the criminal context. But I think the -- the most important thing that the Court said in -- the two most important things that the Court said in Montalvo-Murillo, as are relevant here, is that, first, when Congress doesn't specify a remedy -- and Congress has not specified a remedy in this case -- it’s inappropriate for courts to impose their own. The second thing that the Court said is that we should presume that Federal district courts are going to comply with legal obligations, and we shouldn't make rules based on the assumption that they won't. And third is that when courts do impose remedies, they shouldn't make -- impose a remedy where there’s a profound lack of fit between the violation that occurred and the remedy that the defendant is asking them to impose. Let me give you an example on that. The general rule in Federal criminal litigation is that the Federal district court is supposed to impose sentence without unnecessary delay. Now, say the district court violates that obligation. It takes too long to impose a sentence. I think it would be extraordinary to suggest that the remedy of a district court's unnecessary delay in sentencing the defendant means the defendant should get off scot-free. The remedy is to tell the district court you have taken too long to impose the sentence; impose the sentence forthwith. The same thing is true here. Congress has told the district court you need to impose restitution in every case where the defendant is convicted of a crime of violence."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "HEYTENS",
    "speech": "We don't think it means the same thing, Mr. Chief Justice. What we think it means is the violation should have the same consequences. The violation is to say if you don't do what you are supposed to, the remedy is to do it immediately. The remedy isn't to say you don't have to do it anymore. If there are no further questions, the government urges that the judgment of the court below be affirmed."

The error here occurred when the district court did not impose restitution. The government should have filed a timely appeal under Rule 4. They had 30 days to do so. The government did not appeal the failure to make restitution. That error is not before this Court now. What’s before this Court is a second judgment."

But there is one sentence in a criminal case on a particular charge, and that sentence can include restitution, it can include a fine, it can include imprisonment. That doesn't make it three sentences. And only when all of those have been imposed is there a final judgment. Until then, the judgment -- did it do it within 90 days? When it didn't, the government had to appeal. The government did not do that."
