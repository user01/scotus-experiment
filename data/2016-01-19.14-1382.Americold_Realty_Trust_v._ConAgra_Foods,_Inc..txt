7           ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL D. POSPISIL

8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9             MR. POSPISIL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10 and may it please the Court:

11             The issue before the Court today is whose

12 citizenship  citizenship controls for purposes of

13 diversity when a trust is a named party to a lawsuit.

14             We believe, based upon over 200 years of

15 jurisprudence from this Court, the answer is the

16 trustees.  We believe a brightline rule is appropriate

17 in this case, that in a lawsuit involving a trust, just

18 as with a trustee, the trustee should be the party of

19 interest.  And we should compare it to the 

20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why should we get to that

21 question if, when this case began, even if you looked

22 only to the citizenship of the trustees, there was no

23 complete diversity?

24             MR. POSPISIL:  Your Honor, that  that is

25 correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
4 1             However, we do argue  and we argued in the 2 Tenth Circuit; it was briefed  upon whether or not we 3 could dismiss the  the  the spoiling nondiverse 4 parties.  That issue was briefed under Evergreen case, 5 and it was briefed before the Tenth Circuit; however, 6 the Tenth Circuit did not address that issue. 7             Respondents bring it up in their brief now; 8 however, our position is that this Court should address 9 the issue that's taken, that it granted cert on, and 10 send that issue back to the Tenth Circuit for review. 11             What the Tenth Circuit held here, the issue 12 that we appealed on, was to look at the beneficiaries as 13 opposed to the trustees.  And we would submit to you 14 that that's just not supportable under common law, and 15 it provides results in an unworkable test that is going 16 to create more confusion than looking at the trustees. 17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  At common law, the trustees 18 could sue, couldn't they? 19             MR. POSPISIL:  They could, Your Honor. 20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And these trustees could 21 not sue, could  can they? 22             MR. POSPISIL:  They cannot, Your Honor. 23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because of a new creature 24 created by Maryland law. 25             MR. POSPISIL:  That's correct,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Justice Scalia.  Maryland law has created a statutory

5

2 trust, a real estate investment trust.

3             However, our position is that just because

4 that trust can sue and be sued as an entity, that does

5 not change the analysis.  There still has to be somebody

6 we look to, some real people that we look to to

7 determine whose citizenship controls.

8             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, this new entity is

9 called a trust, but why is it more like a traditional

10 trust than it is like another unincorporated, artificial

11 entity, like an L.L.C.?

12             MR. POSPISIL:  Your Honor, it's more  it's

13 like a trust because there are two attributes that a

14 trust have, that have historically had.  There is a

15 separation between legal ownership, and beneficial or

16 equitable ownership.  We have it in this case.

17             If you look at Maryland law, they define

18 REIT as an unincorporated business trust in which

19 property is acquired, held, managed, administered,

20 controlled, invested, or disposed of for the benefit and

21 profit of any person who may become a shareholder.  That

22 distinguishes between legal ownership and equitable

23 ownership.

24             The next step we look at is that the common

25 law, when that's the situation, when you have a trust,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 you look and see did the trustees have the customary

6

2 power to control, to manage, and to oversee the assets.

3 Also including to control 

4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So who  who owns  who

5 owns these assets under Maryland law?  Is it the

6 trustees, or is it this  this new corporationtype

7 entity?

8             MR. POSPISIL:  Your Honor 

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the entity that can

10 sue, and I assume that that's the entity that owns the

11 property.

12             MR. POSPISIL:  It can be both, Your Honor.

13 Under Maryland law 

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And  and the trustees are

15 sort of in the position of managers 

16             MR. POSPISIL:  Your 

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:   just  just as though

18 you  you hired a  a CEO.

19             MR. POSPISIL:  I would disagree, Your Honor.

20 Under Maryland law, the assets of a real estate

21 investment trust can be held by the trustees, or the

22 trust in its entity.

23             Again, I don't think that makes the 

24 changes the analysis at all.  It  it's still what

25 citizenship we would look to.

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It can be owned by the

3 entity?

4             MR. POSPISIL:  It can be.

5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or  or the trustees.

6             MR. POSPISIL:  That's correct, Your Honor.

7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You mean in  in

8 one case, or you can have a different type of trust?

9             MR. POSPISIL:  In one case.

10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In one case.

11             MR. POSPISIL:  In one case, Your Honor.

12             And I will say this, Justice Scalia, that no

13 statute in the country that we have found has ever held

14 that the legal ownership goes in the name of a trust

15 beneficiary.  The ownership is always in the name of the

16 trust or the trustees.  It is never held in the name of

17 the beneficiaries.

18             And we think that is controlling here for

19 the reason that  Navarro is pretty clear on this.

20 When you have a trustee that has absolute control, you

21 don't look at the beneficiaries.  If the  if the

22 trustee has absolute control and legal ownership of

23 trust assets, that's where you look to.  That was

24 exactly what happened in Navarro.

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That was a trustee who had

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
8 1 the authority to sue, right, in the trustee's own name? 2             MR. POSPISIL:  That is correct, Your Honor. 3 And that  that is what happened  4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's not the case 5 here. 6             MR. POSPISIL:  That is what happened in 7 Navarro. 8             However, the trust in Navarro was a 9 Massachusetts trust, and it could have sued in its own 10 name as well. 11             And the way that Navarro was framed by the 12 lower court when they decided the opinion was the 13 district court held that, for purposes of a business 14 trust, we look to the citizenship of the beneficiaries. 15 This Court  16             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But didn't  didn't  17 Carden treated Navarro as a case where the suit was 18 against the individual members, the individual trustees, 19 trustees as individuals, not the trust. 20             MR. POSPISIL:  That's correct, Your Honor. 21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So I thought Carden was 22 trying  was set up  if you're a corporation, that's 23 one thing.  If you're any other kind of association, we 24 look to the members, the shareholders.  I mean the  25 the limited partners as well as the partners.  Just
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
9 1 drawing a clear line between corporations on one side, 2 all other associations, and  with the  with the 3 added notion that, if Congress wants to make it 4 different, Congress can do that. 5             MR. POSPISIL:  Your Honor, we believe what 6 Carden did is Carden tells us if you're not a 7 corporation, if you're another entity but not a 8 corporation, we need to look behind the curtain, so to 9 speak, and look to somebody else to see whose 10 citizenship controls. 11             Carden did not involve a trust, didn't 12 involve  did not involve trustees, and did not involve 13 trust assets or trust beneficiaries.  That's why Navarro 14 did not control in Carden, and why Carden does not 15 control in this case. 16             Carden tells us the first step we have to do 17 is we have to look through the trust.  We have to look 18 to somebody.  Carden dealt with a partnership.  And in 19 terms of a partnership, relying on a long line of cases, 20 Carden said that for partnerships, we look at all the 21 members. 22             Well, there are no members in a trust. 23 There are no members.  At common law, a partnership was 24 owned by members.  They had a legal ownership of that 25 partnership and the assets.
Alderson Reporting Company

10 1             That just didn't exist at  at common law 2 with trusts. 3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, this is not a 4 traditional trust, because this is shareholders and not 5 beneficiaries. 6             MR. POSPISIL:  Your Honor  7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It  it's a very 8 different sort of concept.  So now you're asking us to 9 come and place trustee law above our general rule, that 10 you're either a corporation or you're not. 11             MR. POSPISIL:  Justice Sotomayor  12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And only the corporation 13 can have a place of business or an  a place of 14 incorporation. 15             MR. POSPISIL:  Your Honor, we  we admit 16 that the nomenclature is "shareholder."  That's what's 17 used in the Real Estate Investment Trust Act in 18 Maryland. 19             However, that's not to be equated with 20 another business entity.  It's a shareholder is what 21 they are called, but still they are the beneficial 22 owners.  The  the  the definition I read to you of a 23 REIT under Maryland law makes clear that the 24 shareholders own  that the trustees own the property 25 for the benefit  or the trust, for the benefit of the
Alderson Reporting Company

1 shareholders.

Official

11

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought the

3 shareholders owned the property.  They had the legal

4 interest in the law.

5             MR. POSPISIL:  No, Your Honor.  No.  It's

6 either the trust or the trustees under Maryland law.

7             So Carden gets us halfway.  The next thing

8 we need to do is look at Navarro, and Navarro tells us

9 if it's management and customary to control these

10 assets, we look to the trustees.

11             I would tell the Court that the trustees in

12 this case are very identical to the power of the

13 trustees in the Navarro case.  If you look at our

14 petition for writ, and the appeal, on the page of the

15 appendix, page 60, that's the amended statement of trust

16 for Americold Realty Trust.

17             In Section 5.1 on page 60, it defines the

18 board of trustees and what their powers are.  "Under

19 this Trust"  this is a quote  "the business and

20 affairs of the Trust shall be managed under the

21 direction of the board of trustees, and the board shall

22 have full, exclusive, and absolute power, control, and

23 authority over any and all property of the Trust.  The

24 board may take any action as, in its sole judgment and

25 discretion, is necessary or appropriate to conduct the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 business and affairs of the Trust."

12

2             That is almost identical to the language

3 used to describe the trustees in Navarro.  Importantly,

4 in Navarro  this is a quote from Navarro as well 

5 "The Court has never analogized express trust to

6 business entities for purposes of diversity

7 jurisdiction."  Navarro realized that they were

8 separate.

9             And Carden realized that it was separate,

10 too.  In Carden, this Court specifically held that the

11 real party in interest test that was adopted and used

12 for Navarro was unique because it was the common law's

13 dealings with trustees, which just didn't exist in

14 Carden.

15             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that the

16 distinction in Carden was quite plain, that Carden was a

17 case against the individual trustees, not against the

18 trust.  Carden did say that.

19             MR. POSPISIL:  Carden distinguished Navarro;

20 that's correct, Your Honor.  That is correct.

21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  On the ground that the

22 suit there was against the individual trustees, not the

23 trust.

24             MR. POSPISIL:  That's correct.  However,

25 Carden did not decide that issue because, again, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 trust was not at   there was not a trust issue in

13

2 Carden.  However, if you look at Navarro, what Navarro

3 did is even though the trustees were the named parties,

4 Navarro Court went ahead and looked, and said let's look

5 at not only the trustees and what their power is, but

6 let's look at the beneficiaries.  Shall we look at them

7 as well?  There's 9,500 of those.

8             And the Court specifically said that is

9 irrelevant.  We do not look at the 9,500 beneficiaries

10 of this trust.  So the Court didn't have a trust as a

11 party in front of it, but it went ahead and took the

12 next step to say, look, who do we need to look at?  Do

13 we need to look at the beneficiary owners, or the

14 trustees?

15             And that same analysis applies here.  And it

16 doesn't matter if the Trust is the named party or the

17 trustees.  The decision is still going to be the same.

18 A decision has to be made at who you look to.

19             We would submit 

20             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I thought that one of the

21 virtues of Carden was that it just set up very

22 categorical, brightline rule.  Everything that's an

23 artificial legal entity that's not a corporation ought

24 to be treated in the same way.  Doesn't matter what you

25 call yourself; you can put trust in the title, or not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1 put trust in the title.  If you're an artificial legal 2 entity that is not a corporation, that's subject to the 3 rule of Carden. 4             And there's something, too, just doing that 5 in that brightline, categorical way, so that we don't 6 have to look at the thousands of different variations 7 among legal entities and decide which fits in which box. 8             MR. POSPISIL:  Your Honor, Carden dealt with 9 a partnership that had members.  Again, there are no 10 members in a trust.  So if we export the language used 11 in Carden to say you have to go  look at the members 12 because they're who you really look at, well, the 13 closest thing to a member of a trust is going to be the 14 trustees; it's not going to be the beneficiary. 15             Let's look back at common law.  When a 16 partnership  before they could sue or be sued in their 17 own name, a partnership always had to have  the 18 members of that partnership had to bring the cause of 19 action. 20             Now let's look at the common law for a trust 21 before a trust could be sued or sue in its own name.  In 22 those circumstances, the trustees were in charge of the 23 litigation.  It was the trustees that brought that 24 lawsuit. 25             So to the extent that Carden sheds any light
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 on what is a member and what is not a member for the

15

2 trust, we submit that the most analogous thing is that

3 the trustee is the equivalent to a member for a

4 partnership.  The problem with the Tenth Circuit's rule

5 looking at all the beneficiaries, that's going to be a

6 problem that is so unworkable that in certain

7 circumstances you're not even going to be able to tell

8 who is a beneficiary.

9             For example, some trusts, like a charitable

10 trust, don't even have beneficiaries identified.

11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why should it matter as

12 long as it's not a corporation?

13             MR. POSPISIL:  Because, Your Honor, again,

14 we go impact to how trusts have been treated separately

15 and distinctly, as a historical matter, for hundreds of

16 years.  A trust has never been held to be equal to a

17 business entity.

18             There are basically three different

19 categories:  There's a corporation; there's an

20 unassociated  unincorporated association, excuse me;

21 and there are trusts.  And they are different.

22             But the beneficiary analysis used by the

23 Tenth Circuit, again, not only it would be hard to

24 identify who some beneficiaries are, but we have

25 sometimes  look at Navarro.  There were 9,500

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
16 1 beneficiaries in that trust.  As  as one of the amicus 2 points out  3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  How many are there in this 4 one? 5             MR. POSPISIL:  There are between 100 and 6 200, Your Honor. 7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that  you know, how  8 how many are  are there normally in these special 9 Maryland trusts? 10             MR. POSPISIL:  To be a Real Estate 11 Investment Trust for purposes of Federal taxation 12 benefits, it's got to be at least at 100. 13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  At least a hundred. 14             MR. POSPISIL:  At least 100. 15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you know of any that  16 that are more than a thousand? 17             MR. POSPISIL:  Oh, yes. 18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Really? 19             MR. POSPISIL:  Yes, Your Honor.  If you look 20 at the amicus that was filed by NAREIT, they point out 21 that there are some publicly traded REITs that have tens 22 of millions of shareholders or beneficiaries.  And 23 they're not only all across the country; they're all 24 across the world. 25             And so a lot of these shares of REITs are
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 also traded on a daily basis.  So you can have a

17

2 beneficiary of a Real Estate Investment Trust that 10:00

3 o'clock this morning I could be a beneficiary, 10:15 I'm

4 not; I sold my interest.  How are you ever going to

5 identify who the beneficiaries are at any given time?

6             This Court has made clear, specifically for

7 jurisdictional purposes, that we need a simple test that

8 courts can use that says we don't need to look behind 

9 dig down deep in the weeds.  Let's just look at the

10 case, figure out who do we look to.  And the proper way

11 to do that is the trustees.

12             In this case, there's five trustees.  It's

13 very easy to find out who those trustees are.  All you

14 have to do is go to the Maryland  excuse me 

15 Maryland Secretary of State, and you can look up and

16 find the Declaration of Trust and you're going to see

17 who those five individuals are.  There's no place, ever,

18 to look, prior to extensive discovery, which is going to

19 be timeconsuming, to find out who the beneficiaries

20 are.  That's just 

21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, why should  I

22 mean, it  it is the person who's invoking diversity

23 jurisdiction has to show the diversity, and if they

24 can't, then you sue in State court.

25             MR. POSPISIL:  That  that's an option,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Your Honor.  However, the purpose of a diversity

18

2 jurisdiction is to get a neutral playing ground for 

3 for companies and for businesses of all types to have an

4 unworkable test that, at the front end, would make it

5 almost impossible for a litigant to even make that

6 decision 

7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that's true of

8 partnerships; it's true of LLCs; it's true of a wide

9 variety of legal entities.

10             MR. POSPISIL:  That's true, Your Honor.  And

11 partnerships are controlled specifically by Carden.

12 However, I would submit that there's not going to be as

13 many partners as there's going to be trustees and

14 beneficiaries, potentially, for  especially for a Real

15 Estate Investment Trust.

16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does it  is it a

17 pertinent consideration in terms of the impact on

18 Federal jurisdiction?  I mean, this is standard,

19 runofthemill commercial dispute about a commercial

20 accident.  And adopting one position would limit the

21 number of times that such disputes would be brought in

22 Federal court.  The other one will expand it.  Is

23 that  I mean, does Americold really feel that it's not

24 going to get a fair shake in the Kansas courts in this

25 case?

Alderson Reporting Company

1             MR. POSPISIL:  Yes, Your Honor.  They

3 have more neutrality in a level playing ground in a

4 Federal court, not only in Kansas, but all across the

5 country.  Wherever  Americold has 175 different

6 locations, with  with deep  cold storage; excuse me.

7 They're all across the country.  They can be sued

8 anywhere.

9             And under the rule the Tenth Circuit has put

10 forth, they're never going to be able to go to Federal

11 court.  It's just never going to happen.  It's almost

12 going to be a near impossibility.

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, maybe that's a

14 problem for  for Congress as  as the problem of

15 corporations was.  You know, Congress adopted a special

16 rule for corporations, and maybe it ought to adopt a

17 special rule for real estate investment trusts.

18             MR. POSPISIL:  Congress always could, Your

19 Honor.  However, I don't think they have to in this

20 case, because I think this Court's opinion in Navarro,

21 coupled with Carden, provide the answer.

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you have any

23 definition of what the common law trust was?  I'll 

24 I'll give you the ones I understand, and you tell me how

25 you don't.

Alderson Reporting Company

1             I thought in a common law trust, the

20

2 trustees had legal title.  They owned the assets.  They

3 could be sued individually, and  and they could sue in

4 their own names.

5             In this REIT, as I understand it, the assets

6 are in the name of the Trust, not in the name of the

7 individual trustees, and it is the Trust that sues or

8 can be sued, not the individual trustees.

9             Am I wrong about those 

10             MR. POSPISIL:  You are wrong in the second

11 point, Your Honor.

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right 

13             MR. POSPISIL:  Yeah.

14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   so go  I'm right on

15 the first part.

16             MR. POSPISIL:  Yes.  The  the  the point

17 that  that you're incorrect is under Maryland law with

18 this statute, the property of a trust can be held in the

19 name of the trust itself, or the trustees.

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you have a section

21 for that?  I'm going to look it up, so.

22             MR. POSPISIL:  Okay.

23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because that's not how I

24 originally understood things, but  that's all right 

25             MR. POSPISIL:  Okay.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
21 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   you can give it to me 2 on rebuttal. 3             MR. POSPISIL:  Justice Sotomayor, it's the 4 Maryland Code of Corporations and Associations Section 5 8301(12).  And that provision  it's also on page 14 6 of our reply brief, the yellow brief.  And that statute, 7 that provision says:  "A REIT may hold and dispose of 8 legal title to property either, quote, in the name of 9 the trust or in the name of the trustees." 10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Thank you. 11             MR. POSPISIL:  So we  we believe the 12 proper test is  is a combination between Navarro and 13 Carden and we should look at the trustees and it doesn't 14 matter whether or not the real estate investment trust 15 can sue on its own behalf or has to sue through the 16 trustees.  It's all clear that the beneficiaries of the 17 trust never have legal ownership; so, therefore, we 18 should never look to them. 19             If the Court has any other questions, 20 otherwise I'll remain my time. 21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 22             Mr. Duggan. 23              ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. DUGGAN 24               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 25             MR. DUGGAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
Alderson Reporting Company

1 please the Court:

Official

22

2             We urge the Court to adopt and reaffirm its

3 brightline ruling announced in Carden that artificial

4 entity associations sued or suing in their own names

5 must measure their diversity citizenship by all of their

6 members, which would include those persons who own a

7 beneficial interest in the entity.

8             In this case, that would be the shareholder

9 members of a REIT who are in perfect accord with the

10 limited partners' ownership interest in Carden.

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Would you describe

12 beneficiaries as a member  member of a trust?  I mean,

13 as you articulate it.  I think what's different than

14 this, and Carden sort of gets you past the trust.  But

15 you then have to still make a choice:  Okay.  We're not

16 going to look at the trust.  Do we look at the trustees

17 or the beneficiaries?  And I  I don't know if I'd call

18 beneficiaries members of a trust.

19             MR. DUGGAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, I think it's

20 important to understand that there is a very significant

21 distinction between a shareholder of a REIT and a

22 beneficiary of a common law traditional trust.

23             As set forth in the appendix to the

24 petition, page 79, which is the Declaration of Trust for

25 Americold, the actual shareholders have personal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
23 1 property interest in the shares.  They do not have any 2 interest in the property of the trust entity, and they 3 have no right to compel any partition, division, 4 dividend, or distribution of the trust property. 5             And that makes them uniquely different than 6 a common law beneficiary who actually has an equitable 7 ownership interest in the trust property. 8             Under common law traditions, the trustee 9 holds the legal title to the asset but only for the 10 benefit of those persons who are named as beneficiaries. 11 And those beneficiaries have equitable rights in the 12 property that's legally nominally in the name of the 13 trustee. 14             Here the shareholder members, as we describe 15 them, only have an interest in the personal property of 16 a certificate of ownership, very much like the limited 17 partners in Carden. 18             In Carden the limited partners didn't have 19 an ownership interest in the assets of the entity.  It 20 had a certificate of ownership as a limited partner. 21             In those two instances, Mr. Chief Justice, 22 this limited partner in Carden and the trustee member, 23 or the beneficiary member in this case, are virtually 24 identical.  They do two things:  They invest money in an 25 artificial entity and receive a certificate of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 ownership, and they periodically vote on important

24

2 matters that affect the entity.

3             They are, in most instances, virtually

4 identical.

5             So in my view  and I think this case rests

6 upon defining a clear rule, a clear rule that says when

7 you have an artificial entity, we're going to measure by

8 those persons that I consider to be the beneficial

9 owners.

10             And I'll tell you why that's important:

11 Because that is consonant with the rule announced by

12 this Court in Chapman, Great Southern, Bouligny, and

13 Carden.

14             Chapman v. Barney, the doctrinal wall case,

15 those persons that were deemed to be members were the

16 persons that were the stock owners of the joint stock

17 company under New York law.

18             In Great Southern, again a limited

19 partnership case, were those persons that had an

20 economic interest in the entity.

21             And the same rule applied in Carden.

22             If we are to adopt Americold's position in

23 this case and now suggest that the board of trustees

24 that do not have an economic ownership interest in the

25 entity itself controls, we're going to open the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
25 1 floodgates of uncertainty for the under  for the lower 2 courts. 3             And I'll tell you why. 4             The Court has never explicitly addressed a 5 limited liability company, and they're common throughout 6 the United States.  Limited liability companies can call 7 their boards of managers boards of trustees.  And in 8 certain instances under those uniform laws, both the 9 general partnership law and the LLC law, managers can 10 hold property in trust for the entity just like the 11 trustees in this case can hold property in trust for the 12 entity. 13             At the end of the day, if we're going to now 14 say it's the board of managers that are called trustees 15 that we look to, everyone's going to analogize in the 16 circuits that haven't decided the LLC question:  I'm 17 much more like the board of managers in Americold and 18 much different than the limited partners in Carden.  And 19 it's going to create uncertainty. 20             Our rule, the brightline rule, is very 21 clear.  When an artificial entity is sued or being  or 22 suing in its own name, we look to the members, which in 23 this case constitutes those persons that own the 24 beneficial interest in the entity, the shareholder 25 members, just like this Court did in Chapman, Great
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Southern, Bouligny, and Carden.

26

2             And I think it's important to understand in

3 our view Navarro never decided the question:  Did in

4 fact a trust constitute an entity and who the members of

5 the entity were?

6             Navarro stands for the limited proposition,

7 as suggested by Justice Ginsburg, that in fact we look

8 to those persons that had a right to sue.

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And in this case you

10 couldn't sue the trustees individually, right?

11             MR. DUGGAN:  That is correct.  In this case,

12 under Maryland law, the trustees, even if they are the

13 owners of the property in trust for the entity, still

14 have no authority under the statute to bring suit nor do

15 they have the ability to be sued.

16             The entity itself, Americold Realty Trust,

17 has admitted in this Court and in the Tenth Circuit that

18 it is the successor in interest to the corporation that

19 my client's, ConAgra Foods, entered in to a contract

20 with.  I had no choice but to sue the entity.  When the

21 entity is sued, the doctrinal wall of Chapman v. Barney

22 is in play:  Are you a corporation or are you an

23 artificial association?

24             In this case they're an association.  We

25 measure by those persons that have an ownership interest

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
27 1 in the artificial entity, the shareholder members, not 2 the board of managers. 3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Duggan, do you think 4 it's possible that we took a bit of a wrong turn in  5 in Carden?  In other words, that, in fact, all of these 6 entities should be treated like corporations and that 7 the strongest arguments on the other side, you know, are 8 really those arguments.  And those arguments fly in the 9 face of Carden but that  but they're really arguments 10 about why  why not treat these just like a 11 corporation? 12             MR. DUGGAN:  Well, Justice Kagan, I agree, 13 and I think the Court said in Carden that our decision 14 is precedent bound and perhaps even unresponsive to 15 policy considerations, but it is indeed Congress's 16 prerogative to change the law. 17             And indeed, Congress has spoken.  Congress 18 spoke in 2005, and Congress said, we've legislated 19 against this backdrop of Chapman v. Barney, Great 20 Southern, Bouligny, Carden, and Navarro, and we reached 21 the decision  22             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If we  if we made the 23 law in the first place, why should we say, well, we made 24 it, but we're not going to fix it?  Let Congress fix it. 25             MR. DUGGAN:  Well, because I think Congress
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
28 1 has fixed it, and Congress has recognized, specifically 2 with class action lawsuits, that they would treat 3 associations the same as corporations if they are named 4 as a party in a class action lawsuit in the 2005 5 amendments to Section 1332. 6             And they specifically said, if you are an 7 unincorporated association, we're going to look to your 8 place of incorporation and your principal place of 9 business for purposes of diversity jurisdiction in class 10 action lawsuits.  But they did not say if  with regard 11 to every other garden variety commercial dispute like 12 the one we have here today, that that rule would apply. 13             And Congress is capable of speaking. 14 They've spoken post Carden in 2005.  And they've made it 15 clear that those doctrinal walls of Chapman v. Barney 16 should remain in play as announced by this Court but 17 with the limited exception of class action lawsuits. 18             So if the court took a wrong turn in Carden, 19 Congress has affirmed it only to the extent that it has 20 announced a rule that applies to associations for policy 21 reasons in class action cases. 22             JUSTICE BREYER:  The problem, just from the 23 point of view of the common sense of it, is you have an 24 organization that has, A, the organization; B, the 25 trustees; and C, the shareholders.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1             So applying Carden, what you would say  2 and Navarro:  If you sue the trustees, you look to their 3 citizenship.  But if you sue the trust itself, you don't 4 look to the citizenship of the trust; you don't look to 5 the citizenship of the trustees.  You go beyond that and 6 look to the citizenship of the members. 7             I mean, that seems odd.  Why do you look to 8 the members or the shareholders, or the  or the 9 beneficiaries where you sue the trust itself but you 10 don't in the identical situation where the law of the 11 State allows you to sue the trustees?  I mean, that 12 seems such a sport, such a  a fluke. 13             MR. DUGGAN:  But it is the sport that's 14 played even with regard to limited partnerships, 15 Justice Breyer, because in the instance where in a 16 limited partnership a general partner who is managing 17 the affairs of the entity breaches a duty to a third 18 party and the entity itself also is responsible for a 19 breach of duty, a party can sue both the general partner 20 and the artificial entity.  And if the general partner 21 happens to be an individual, you measure by his natural 22 citizenship and you measure the entity by virtue of who 23 the members are. 24             And people make tactical reasons every day 25 in the United States about who to sue and who not to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 sue.  In some instances, they may choose to sue the

30

2 general partner because they want to get into Federal

3 court and they don't want to sue the entity, but they'll

4 take their risks on suing only one of the parties that's

5 liable, or they may sue all of them.  But they have to

6 satisfy the rules applicable to each one of those

7 particular parties that may be responsible.

8             I think the other thing that's important

9 here is that the  the argument suggested by the

10 Petitioner is that we look to the control test, a test

11 of those persons that are in control, and this Court has

12 implicitly and expressly rejected that test.

13 Specifically, the Court rejected it in Carden.  But more

14 implicitly, if you look at the Chapman v. Barney case,

15 Barney was a plaintiff in the case, brought the suit as

16 president of the New York Stock Company, and he had the

17 absolute right under New York law to control the

18 litigation and bring the claim.

19             But the Court never looked to the control of

20 the litigation by Barney as a reason why it should

21 measure the citizenship of the entity.  It looked to all

22 the owner members of the company.  And this Court 

23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it the Petitioner's

24 position that the Real Estate Investment Trust is more

25 like a trust than an LLC, than a limited partnership?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. DUGGAN:  I think it's made that

31

2 suggestion to the Court, but in our 

3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And  and if that is

4 their position, what would your response be?

5             MR. DUGGAN:  Our response would be 

6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why  why is an REIT more

7 like a limited partner than it is a common law trust?

8             MR. DUGGAN:  There's two primary reasons,

9 Justice Kennedy.  The first one is, this is an

10 artificial entity.  And the entity can hold the assets,

11 and it's managed by a board of trustees, some of whom

12 may or may not hold the assets of the entity in trust.

13 But that's no different than a  a general partner of a

14 limited partnership.  They can hold assets 

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it seems to me

16 that's a wash because what you describe is a common law

17 trust as well, so I'm 

18             MR. DUGGAN:  Precisely.

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That sounds like a wash.

20             MR. DUGGAN:  In my view, the one market

21 distinction between their assertion here and a common

22 law trust is this isn't a common law trust.  It is an

23 artificial entity.  And if in fact their trustees can

24 hold assets for the entity, then maybe they are acting

25 as trustees and maybe they can bring certain claims.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 But our brightline rule is this.

32

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What  a common law trust

3 exists in nature?  That's the common law?

4             MR. DUGGAN:  Well 

5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it's not an artificial

6 entity.

7             MR. DUGGAN:  It's not an artificial entity.

8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because we know it and

9 love it so well or what?

10             MR. DUGGAN:  Well, it's been around since

11 the Middle Ages, as I understand the brief of Winston

12 Wong, the amicus in the case.  And from that vantage

13 point, common law trust entities have never been

14 recognized as entity status with capacity to sue and be

15 sued as an entity.  The trustees who are the legal

16 nominal owners of the assets bring the claim.  That's a

17 significant distinction.  But just as importantly, the

18 beneficiary shareholders of a REIT have no equitable

19 interest in the assets of the artificial entity because

20 the very Trust declaration itself provides it's merely

21 personal property.  They are so much like the limited

22 partners in Carden that it's striking.

23             But just as importantly, I think, back to

24 the point I was making, the Court expressly rejected the

25 control test in Carden and said, quote, "real persons to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 controversy test" and, quote, "which parties have

33

2 control over the subject of the litigation" have never

3 guided our reasoning with regard to who are the citizens

4 of an artificial entity.  And in fact they can't point

5 to one single case by this Court where this Court has

6 ignored the citizenship of the beneficial owners of an

7 entity and instead substituted in a board of managers.

8             And indeed, if that were the holding of the

9 Court today, the Court would be reversing itself from

10 hundreds of years of precedent where it  it chose in

11 Chapman, Great Southern, Bouligny, and Carden to look to

12 the ownership of the members and the artificial entity.

13             One final point with regard to difficulty in

14 measuring these entities.

15             It was suggested that there might be

16 thousands of members of a REIT.  Well, that very well

17 could be true.  But there also could be thousands of

18 limited partners in these sophisticated limited

19 partnerships that are being used for real estate

20 transactions.  Just because there are a lot of owners of

21 an artificial entity association doesn't seem to weigh

22 heavily enough to create the ambiguity that you would

23 under 

24             JUSTICE BREYER:  Look  look at the other

25 odd thing in writing this opinion your way.  You say,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 well, this isn't really like a trust.  I mean, it is

34

2 sort of a trust, but there are important differences.

3 They can sue and be sued.  The trust itself can hold the

4 property, and the beneficiaries do not have an equitable

5 interest.  And because they don't have an equitable

6 interest, it's more like a private association or,

7 et cetera, in Carden.

8             But, of course, that means that we look to

9 their interest.  We look to their property.  We're

10 basically having them as part of the necessary parties

11 because they have a property interest, the very people

12 we just said that this is a different kind of

13 organization because they lack an equitable interest in

14 the property.

15             MR. DUGGAN:  But that's no different than

16 what we do in limited partnerships under Carden.  We

17 simply look at the limited partners for purposes of

18 measuring diversity.  They're only important to the

19 extent that they're required for measuring.

20             The final point is, there was an argument

21 that said, well, you know, REITs are publicly traded and

22 that is true.  But the NAREIT brief, the amicus brief

23 points out that nearly 80 percent of all REITs ought to

24 be corporations.  And most publicly traded REITs are

25 corporations.  And indeed, Maryland REITs can choose the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 corporate form of incorporation, and they would be

35

2 measured simply by the principal place of business and

3 their state of incorporation.

4             Just because a few REITs choose to be

5 associations doesn't seem to justify creating

6 uncertainty in the doctrinal wall framework that's been

7 announced by the Court and now have people trying to

8 analogize to a board of managers instead of the owner

9 beneficial members.

10             I have nothing further unless there's more

11 questions from the Court.

12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I just have one

13 question on the Safeway and Kraft business.  In the

14 Tenth Circuit, you can  you advised the court that you

15 thought they were dispensable, nondiverse parties, but

16 they hadn't appealed.  And before this Court, you agreed

17 to dismiss another dispensable, nondiverse party.  And

18 then your brief comes in and you say, well, I've changed

19 my mind.  They're not dispensable.  It  I wonder why.

20 It seems a bit of sharp practice.

21             MR. DUGGAN:  Well, I think  I think, Mr.

22 Chief Justice, that if in fact that's a question that

23 still remains if you affirm  or if you reverse and say

24 that we measure by the trustees, it should be remanded

25 to the Tenth Circuit for them to make a determination.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
36 1 In the first instance, it was raised by the Petitioners 2 for the first time, as I understand it, in their merits 3 brief that Kraft and Safeway were properly dismissed. 4             We improvidently took the wrong position in 5 front of the Tenth Circuit, and we don't think Newman 6 Green supports that position.  And I think the Court can 7 review Newman Green and look at it and say, well, 8 really, are they dispensable parties or not? 9             And I think, quite frankly, if in fact the 10 Court adopts a ruling here that says we measure by the 11 board of managers instead of the owner members, then it 12 would be appropriate to remand back to the Tenth 13 Circuit, not only to decide the case on the merits, 14 which they didn't decide, but also to make a 15 determination as to whether Kraft and Safeway really 16 truly are dispensable or not. 17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So just extend the 18 litigation even further than it's  19             MR. DUGGAN:  Unfortunately, perhaps. 20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Thank you, 21 counsel. 22             MR.

4             I'd like to start off by addressing

5 Justice Breyer's comment about gamesmanship.  You're

6 absolutely right.  What difference does it make if the

7 Trust is sued or the Trustee is sued?  We're still

8 looking at Trust assets.  It doesn't make 

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  His point really is that

10 this is sort of like a trust but not very much.  And

11 indeed, the key point, to me, is that the shareholders

12 here have no beneficial interest in the property.

13             MR. POSPISIL:  And that's the second

14 argument I wanted to make, Your Honor.  There are two

15 statutes, two statutory cites that I want to give to the

16 Court, and one of them I read already.  Under Maryland

17 Code of Corporations and Associations 8101(c), the

18 definition of REIT is as follows:  "An unincorporated

19 business trust in which property is acquired, held,

20 managed, administered, controlled, invested, or disposed

21 of for the benefit and profit of any person who may

22 become a shareholder."

23             Second provision:  Missouri  or Maryland

24 Code of Corporations and Associations, 1101(e):  The

25 definition of a business trust is "a REIT engaged in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 business in which property is acquired, held, and

38

2 managed for the benefit of shareholders."

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  And then you say in the

4 section shareholders shall have no interest in the

5 property of the trust.

6             MR. POSPISIL:  Your Honor, if  if

7 anything, that  that distinction makes this even

8 further removed.  Why  why would those shareholders,

9 if they have no interest whatsoever, why would we ever

10 even look to them?  That makes even more sense 

11             JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't know.  I didn't

12 write  I didn't write Section 6; your client did.

13             (Laughter.)

14             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what it says, so how

15 are we supposed to take that?

16             MR. POSPISIL:  Your Honor, I  I would say

17 that the statute obviously is  is what controls here.

18 I mean, because we want to have a rule that's across the

19 board for all trusts.  And if you look at the statute of

20 Maryland, the statute language I just said definitely

21 creates an equitable interest in shareholders  bless

22 you  for a Real Estate Investment Trust.

23             There is another point that Respondents

24 made; I'd like to point out, is that they said there is

25 no case in which this Court has looked to anything other

39 1 than beneficiaries when you're involved in a case with a 2 trust.  I would submit there  there's two responses to 3 that. 4             Number one, there is a case that we cited in 5 our brief.  It's called Thomas v. The Board of Trustees 6 of the Ohio State University.  In that case, the Board 7 itself was sued in its own name.  It was the party.  It 8 was allowed to be sued by the Ohio laws.  It was a case 9 that involved adverse possession with some property 10 that  that the  the students and the university 11 owned.  There was an issue of jurisdiction, whether or 12 not there was diversity. 13             The court looked, not to who the 14 beneficiaries of that board of trustees were; the court 15 looked to the trustees that sat on that board.  That's 16 who they looked to.  They weren't a party to that 17 action.  The court nowhere looked at the beneficiaries. 18 You're not going to see that  that language at all in 19 that case. 20             And the second case, this Court  21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I  I don't  who  22 who  who was the party?  Who was the defendant in that 23 case? 24             MR. POSPISIL:  It was Board of Trustees of 25 the Ohio State University.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
40 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say the trustees were 2 not a party? 3             MR. POSPISIL:  That's correct.  The board 4 itself  5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You separate the board of 6 trustees from the  from the trustees? 7             MR. POSPISIL:  No.  The  the board of 8 trustees, it would be like the equivalent of a trust. 9 You look at the trust.  Okay, well, who do you look to? 10 Do you look to who the beneficiaries of that are, or do 11 you look at who controls them? 12             And what the court did in that case is they 13 looked to who controlled  looked to the members of 14 that board. 15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is  is that standard with 16  with common law trusts?  Can you sue either the 17 trustees or the board of trustees? 18             MR. POSPISIL:  Your Honor, when I say "board 19 of trustees," I'm talking  that was a unit.  That was 20 a specific entity.  It was called the board of trustees. 21 It was an entity that was created under Ohio law. 22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  When you have a bunch of 23 trustees, aren't they normally referred to as the board 24 of trustees? 25             MR. POSPISIL:  That's true, Your Honor.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
41 1 However, this was a specific provision under Ohio law 2 that allowed that entity itself to be sued or sue in its 3 own name.  And what the court did is it looked behind 4 the curtain  5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  There's a special statute 6 that  that allowed the board of trustees  7             MR. POSPISIL:  That's correct, Your Honor; 8 that's correct. 9             Another case, more recently, where the court 10 did, in fact, look to something beyond the 11 beneficiaries, is Navarro, of course.  Navarro did look 12 at the beneficiaries.  It said we're going to look at 13 the beneficiaries, but that's not going to control. 14             And I realize that a trust was not the named 15 party there, but the court  it would  it would have 16 been superfluous for this Court to even look at the 17 beneficiaries if that was not an issue. 18             The court knew that it's going to be 19 trustees or the beneficiaries.  And they specifically 20 said, the 9,500 beneficiaries, we don't look at. 21             We believe the same rule should apply here. 22             If the Court has no other questions, we  23             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  I do have one. 24             MR. POSPISIL:  Yes. 25             JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose I wanted a list.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
42 1 I  I wanted a list, a synthesis of which Bogert or  2 or Scott on trusts has as the characteristic of the 3 traditional common law trusts.  And then I'd like, over 4 in the other column, the characteristics of your 5 organization. 6             MR. POSPISIL:  Okay. 7             JUSTICE BREYER:  And now what do I read?  I 8  I  don't think you can list them now.  Is there 9 something I can read just to get an idea of that? 10             MR. POSPISIL:  Yeah. 11             JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe they are identical. 12 Are you going to say they're  13             MR. POSPISIL:  They are  they are 14 identical.  And I can lay them out for you. 15             Let's go on the left side.  The left side, 16 you're going to have traditional trusts.  You're going 17 to have a separation between legal ownership and 18 equitable ownership. 19             Let's look on the right side.  Let's look at 20 a real estate investment trust under Maryland law.  You 21 have legal ownership, which is either in the name of the 22 trustees or the trust, and you also have equitable 23 ownership, and then shareholders. 24             And I'll go back to those two statutes that 25 I  that I cited to you earlier, Your Honor.

43 1             So those were the attributes that exist in a
 2 common law trust, and they're also the attributes that
 3 exist with a Maryland real estate investment trust.
 4             If the Court has no other further questions,
 5 we would request that the Court reverse the Tenth
 6 Circuit.
 7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
