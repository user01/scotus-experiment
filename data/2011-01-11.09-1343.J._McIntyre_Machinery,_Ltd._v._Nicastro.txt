3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:13 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 09-1343, J. McIntyre 5 Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro. 6 Mr. Fergenson. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR F. FERGENSON 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. FERGENSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 10 it please the Court: 11 Because J. McIntyre did not direct any 12 activity at residents of New Jersey either itself or by 13 directing its distributor MMA to do so and had no 14 awareness or knowledge that the distributor took the 15 action that it did toward New Jersey, New Jersey lacked 16 adjudicative jurisdiction. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: When you say "its 18 distributor," was this distributor at all controlled by 19 the defendant? 20 MR. FERGENSON: No, Your Honor. It was not. 21 And both under Ohio law, Wells v. Komatsu America, and 22 under the Restatement (Second) Agency, section 1(1), the 23 right to control is essential to ascribe actions to 24 create an agency, and it's on a per-purpose basis. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: It might be better to refer
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to it as the company that distributed its product,

4

2 rather than calling it "its distributor."

3 MR. FERGENSON: Very good, Your Honor.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's loaded, it seems to

5 me.

6 MR. FERGENSON: Very good, Your Honor.

7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fergenson, in your

8 question presented to this Court, you ask whether

9 there's personal jurisdiction -- and I'm quoting here -

10 "solely because the manufacturer targets the United

11 States market for the sale of its product."

12 So I'm taking from that, that you

13 acknowledge that this manufacturer, McIntyre, a British

14 manufacturer, targeted the United States market for the

15 sale of its product. That's correct, yes?

16 MR. FERGENSON: Your Honor, that's what the

17 New Jersey Supreme Court held, and that's how we

18 fashioned the -

19 JUSTICE KAGAN: That's your question

20 presented.

21 MR. FERGENSON: -- the test.

22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Did this -- well, I'll just

23 ask you, then: Did this manufacturer target the United

24 States market? Did it want to sell its products in the

25 United States?

Alderson Reporting Company

5 1 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor. 2 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So what does that 3 mean, exactly, Mr. Fergenson? Because the United States 4 is the United States. It's made up of 50 States. So I 5 assume that what that means is the manufacturer wanted 6 to sell its products in each of the 50 States. Is that 7 right? 8 MR. FERGENSON: No, Your Honor. 9 JUSTICE KAGAN: It only wanted to sell its 10 product in a few States? 11 MR. FERGENSON: No, Your Honor. It wanted 12 to sell its product anywhere that the distributor could 13 find. The distributor was the market manager. 14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. Anywhere. So if the 15 distributor came up with California, that was great. If 16 the distributor came up with a customer in New Jersey, 17 that was great. As many as possible, more the better, 18 all over the United States. Is that right? 19 MR. FERGENSON: As many as possible, 20 wherever the -- the distributor could find a customer, 21 yes, Your Honor. 22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Exactly. So you targeted 23 New Jersey no less than you targeted California or New 24 York or Illinois or Massachusetts or anything else. 25 MR. FERGENSON: Well --
Alderson Reporting Company

6 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: You targeted the entire 2 United States. Why shouldn't there be jurisdiction in 3 each of the States you targeted? 4 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, because, 5 first, this Court's jurisprudence looks to a direct act, 6 from World-Wide Volkswagen and even before, as it 7 brought forward Hanson. As this Court has applied 8 World-Wide Volkswagen, Burger King and Justice 9 O'Connor's concurrence in Asahi and the other 10 occurrence -- concurrence, Justice Brennan's concurrence 11 in Asahi, look toward a specific State - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Fergenson, I suppose 13 you could say the same thing about any United States 14 manufacturer - 15 MR. FERGENSON: Yes. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- who would desire to sell 17 his product in any of the States that would buy it. 18 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: And to say that this 20 foreign manufacturer is therefore suable in any State 21 would mean that any American manufacturer is suable in 22 any State, which - 23 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- none of our cases hold. 25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suable in any State

1 where the incident arises. This is not general

7

2 jurisdiction. This is specific jurisdiction. So the

3 question is, when you target the entire United States

4 and each of the 50 States within that and an accident

5 occurs within one of those States, are you subject to

6 jurisdiction in that State for that accident, for a

7 claim based on that accident? Not generally, but just

8 for a claim based on that accident.

9 Didn't even Justice O'Connor -- you

10 referenced the Asahi opinions, but Justice O'Connor said

11 as long as there's purposeful availment, there is

12 specific jurisdiction, and there is purposeful availment

13 when there's an active effort to target a market.

14 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, in Burger

15 King, in Hanson, in World-Wide Volkswagen, the

16 purposeful availment is defined as conducting activities

17 within the forum State. The -- this Court, through

18 those opinions, foreseeability, clear notice, reasonably

19 anticipate -- all converge.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In all of those cases,

21 there was a forum in the United States where someone

22 injured in the United States could sue. Your

23 proposition is that a company can deliberately send its

24 products, wants to exploit a U.S. market. But I take it

25 that there is no place in the United States, because New
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Jersey is no different than California or any other

8

2 place -- is it your position that there is no forum in

3 which McIntyre can be sued, even though it set up this

4 distribution arrangement for the very purpose of having

5 its machines in as many locations in the United States

6 as it could? Is there a forum in the United States

7 where it could be sued?

8 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which one?

10 MR. FERGENSON: Ohio. It could have been

11 proceeded against in Ohio.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It could be reached in

13 Ohio. Now, does that make a whole lot of sense? Is it

14 any more convenient for McIntyre to come to Ohio than

15 New Jersey? It's a lot less convenient for

16 Mr. Nicastro, who had his fingers removed by this

17 machine.

18 But you -- you are conceding that there is a

19 forum where this British company can be sued on a tort

20 that occurred in New Jersey. Explain to me why, since

21 there is a forum in the United States, the logical one

22 isn't New Jersey rather than Ohio.

23 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, first, the

24 issue of convenience, choice of law, conflict of law, as

25 a determinative factor was rejected by this Court --

9 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking you -

2 MR. FERGENSON: What?

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the question: Where

4 can it be sued? Well, something happened in New Jersey.

5 The machine, allegedly defective machine, caused a harm

6 there. What happened in Ohio? What basis for specific

7 jurisdiction is there in Ohio? There was no tort in

8 Ohio.

9 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, under Ohio

10 law, the -- there can be an assignment. There was no

11 written contract between MMA and J. McIntyre. There can

12 be an assignment in return for a release of a common law

13 indemnification right.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't understand.

15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but, Mr. Fergenson,

16 just picking up where Justice Ginsburg left off, Ohio is

17 a perfectly good place for jurisdiction over a claim

18 between the British manufacturer and its distributor in

19 Ohio. Any kind of contract claim, a claim based on the

20 agreement between the two -- Ohio is the appropriate

21 place for jurisdiction. But Ohio does not seem the

22 appropriate place for jurisdiction -- and again, we're

23 talking about specific jurisdiction, not general -- as

24 to a claim based on an accident that occurred in New

25 Jersey.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
10 1 The entire idea of specific jurisdiction is 2 that you need a relationship between the defendant and 3 the forum and the claim. And here the claim arose in 4 New Jersey and was in fact not related to Ohio. 5 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, Ohio 6 explicitly provides, and they -- it's arisen in statute 7 of limitation cases, and it goes back to Travelers 8 Indemnity v. Trowbridge, that an action under both 9 express and common law indemnity arises under contract. 10 So, upon the assignment -- and there need 11 not be a judgment under Ohio law; that's Fort Defiance 12 Construction v. Village of Grover Hill -- there can be 13 an assignment of a common law indemnity under strict 14 product liability. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What kind of common law 16 indemnity are we dealing with here? Where does 17 Mr. Nicastro sue? He hasn't got any assignment, any 18 indemnity. Mr. Nicastro is injured in the United States 19 by a machine manufactured in England, and he wants to 20 sue, understandably, in the United States. Why are we 21 talking about assignments, indemnity? That has nothing 22 to do with Mr. Nicastro. 23 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor, it does. 24 Mr. Nicastro had an action under strict product 25 liability. I want to come back to more fully answer the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
11 1 why question that you asked: Why is it just and right 2 that he go -- that he to Ohio? 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I would just like to 4 know first -- you said there is jurisdiction in Ohio and 5 not in New Jersey. In New Jersey, it's the place where 6 the accident occurred; and in Ohio, there's nothing but 7 the relationship between the distributor -- there's a 8 contract between the distributor and McIntyre. So why 9 does Ohio have jurisdiction over this New Jersey tort? 10 MR. FERGENSON: Ohio has New Jersey - 11 jurisdiction. There -- as Your Honor noticed, there are 12 three places that Mr. Nicastro, in looking over this, 13 could have chosen: United Kingdom, which he is now in, 14 in filing a claim in the liquidation proceedings; Ohio; 15 and New Jersey. The accident occurred in New Jersey. 16 That's a forum non conveniens issue that's --  17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a forum what? 18 MR. FERGENSON: That's a convenience issue, 19 a forum non conveniens issue. And Justice Brennan was 20 clear before Burger King that that's what he wanted to 21 see the law go in the direction of. He was clear about 22 that. 23 Ohio, however, in looking at International 24 Shoe, going back to International Shoe, which talks 25 about the relationship between the defendant and the

12

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the claim in suit.

3 That's very important.

4 MR. FERGENSON: And -- and the cause of

5 action, yes. There -- the one place where both the

6 distributor, who would upon suit and then a claim over

7 under product, strict product liability, would disappear

8 -- that's why you could get an assignment -- the

9 distributor is in Ohio, and so too is the contract

10 relationship.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I still don't -- I don't

12 follow how Mr. Nicastro gets involved with assignment,

13 indemnity. Mr. Nicastro has a claim against -- well, he

14 sued them both, but the distributor is now bankrupt.

15 And he says, well, this is specific jurisdiction;

16 specific jurisdiction, as International Shoe teaches, is

17 where the claim arose. International Shoe, it arose in

18 the State of Washington because that's where the shoe -

19 the people who were promoting sale of International

20 Shoe's -- International Shoe's shoes worked every day.

21 So it was a claim relating to a tax owed by

22 International Shoe based on the events that occurred in

23 California. It was not all-purpose jurisdiction.

24 And your suggestion that Ohio somehow is a

25 proper forum for Mr. Nicastro's tort claim, I really
Alderson Reporting Company

1 don't follow that.

13

2 MR. FERGENSON: It -- Your Honor, it is.

3 Mr. Nicastro could have contacted MMA, and stated I have

4 a strict product liability action, or the trustee in

5 bankruptcy. The statute of limitations was 2 years in

6 both cases. Ohio would have applied New Jersey strict

7 liability law.

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your answer to Justice

9 Ginsburg -- I don't want to make your argument for you,

10 but it seems to me rather strange. All of a sudden

11 you're talking about how Ohio law will help you out. I

12 thought the question was, from the standpoint of the

13 defendant at least, whether the defendant purposefully

14 availed itself of the forum. And you would say the

15 defendant here purposefully availed itself of Ohio by

16 choosing an Ohio distributor. But you don't make that

17 argument. You're talking about a contract, an

18 indemnity, which seems to me another step. That's

19 choice of law and applicable law.

20 MR. FERGENSON: I agree, Your Honor; it is

21 choice of law. And -

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Also, I don't think it's

23 worth your time, because frankly it doesn't make a whole

24 lot of difference to me whether they can sue in Ohio or

25 not. You really think that that's --

14 1 MR. FERGENSON: And, Your Honor - 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about in the United 3 States? Would the United States have jurisdiction? 4 MR. FERGENSON: No, because - 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: The United States would 6 not? They surely targeted the United States. 7 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, in the - 8 in Justice O'Connor's footnote on national contacts in 9 Asahi, which was not disputed and I think essentially 10 accepted by Justice Brennan -- in that footnote, it 11 states that national contacts is for the national 12 sovereign to decide. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. But if the 14 national sovereign, the United States, provided by 15 statute that Federal district courts would have 16 jurisdiction over any -- any tort suit by a person 17 injured by a foreign manufacturer that targeted the 18 United States, would that be proper? 19 MR. FERGENSON: This Court has not evaluated 20 under the Fifth Amendment what circumstances it may be, 21 and this is speculation, how Congress would establish 22 it. It may be that Congress - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course. It's a 24 hypothetical. 25 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

15 1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Hypotheticals are always 2 speculation. 3 MR. FERGENSON: I think that - 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you speculate about 5 that? 6 MR. FERGENSON: Yes. Your Honor, I think 7 that, without Klaxon and with a reasonable choice of 8 venue, Congress could establish a uniform system to 9 bring -- to bring foreign defendants into this country. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you say the same 11 thing if, hypothetically, since we're engaging in a 12 hypothetical, the distributor were in France -- machine 13 manufactured in England, distributor is in France, and 14 the distributor then selects the United States and then 15 the same facts, New Jersey? United States would be an 16 appropriate jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause, 17 but not New Jersey? 18 MR. FERGENSON: I think that, with that one 19 step - 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Assuming the statute that 21 Justice Scalia hypothesizes. 22 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor. I think 23 that, with that one step beyond - 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a little odd that the 25 States, which have residual sovereignty, which are not
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
16 1 limited sovereigns, would not have jurisdiction, but the 2 United States, which is a limited sovereignty other than 3 in the foreign affairs area, which may be relevant here, 4 does have jurisdiction. That seems backwards. 5 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, I think 6 that if one looks at this as part of the Congress's 7 power to control, let's say, imports, then as a 8 condition -- and this is what the proposed Foreign 9 Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act looks for. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, Congress has power to 11 control the jurisdiction of Federal courts, and Congress 12 says Federal courts have jurisdiction over this matter. 13 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor. 14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fergenson, could I try 15 another hypothetical? 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the question is why 17 the State can't make the same choice that the Congress 18 does. The State lacks foreign affairs power, to be 19 sure. Is that the only distinction? That doesn't sound 20 to me like due process. What we're talking about is a 21 source of authority, not fairness to the defendant. 22 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, I think - 23 and I go to two words in particular in Burger King, one 24 taken from Hanson, which is "essential": It is 25 essential in each case that there be a purposeful

1 availment of the privilege of conducting activities

17

2 within the forum. And then the other -

3 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Fergenson, the

4 question is whether seeking to serve a market -- and

5 here you're seeking to serve a market in each of the 50

6 States -- is purposeful availment. So let me -- let me

7 just try a different hypothetical.

8 Suppose you had the same arrangement with

9 your distributor in Ohio, but the arrangement was not to

10 serve the entire United States market. Instead, the

11 arrangement was to serve only five States in the

12 Midwest. That's what you wanted, your client wanted,

13 the market to be. So it was going to be Ohio and

14 Indiana and Illinois and Michigan and Iowa, all right?

15 So now a machine blows up in Illinois. Is there

16 jurisdiction in Illinois?

17 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.

18 JUSTICE KAGAN: There is jurisdiction in

19 Illinois, even though your relationship with your

20 distributor was in Ohio. But there's jurisdiction in

21 Illinois because the machine blew up there and you were

22 seeking to serve the market; that's right?

23 MR. FERGENSON: Because there was a

24 direction of the distributor to go into the State where

25 the accident occurred.
Alderson Reporting Company

18 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. Now we have -- now we 2 say this is working very well. Let's get another nine 3 distributors on board. We'll give each of them five 4 States, all right? Now, if I understand you correctly, 5 now you're liable all over the United States because 6 you've had this relationship with 10 different 7 distributors, each of whom are going to serve 5 States. 8 So there's personal jurisdiction in any State where a 9 machine blows up. 10 MR. FERGENSON: If the -- yes, Your Honor, 11 if the States are assigned by name. 12 JUSTICE KAGAN: And now I say: Let's forget 13 these 10 distributors. Who needs 10 distributors? I'll 14 just have one distributor. 15 Why is there any difference? 16 MR. FERGENSON: Because that distributor - 17 unless that distributor is told you must go -- like a 18 traveling salesperson, you must go into each State, you 19 must personally go into each State -- that's purposeful 20 availment. 21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fergenson, with respect, 22 this distributor was told to sell as many products as it 23 could in as many States as it could. 24 MR. FERGENSON: No, it was not, Your Honor. 25 It was not told to do anything more than to sell

7 control, and you said no. But there was coordination,

8 wasn't there? Isn't -- doesn't the record show that the

9 English company traveled to the trade shows with the

10 American company? Wasn't your president, your English

11 president, present at the Las Vegas show in which this

12 New Jersey company first saw the machine? Is that

13 correct?

17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And you

18 approved all marketing efforts. You had to approve -

19 according to the findings of the court below, you

20 approved all the marketing materials that the American

21 company -

22 MR. FERGENSON: No, Your Honor. There is a

23 letter that's undated that speaks about we have

24 advertised under your direction and per your

25 suggestions.

20 1 That letter also states that we've spent 2 $350,000 and we performed the -- we performed repairs 3 and warranty service without seeking reimbursement from 4 you, and that's consistent with the distant relationship 5 here. 6 Your Honor, we asked for the names of the 7 customers. We didn't get it. We didn't get -- we 8 didn't drop-ship. And that would obviously have been a 9 lot less expensive in cost rather than shipping it to 10 Ohio. They were the market maker. They controlled the 11 relationships with the individual customers. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then why was your number 13 and name both printed on the machine and in the warranty 14 book? The American -- obviously, some customers had to 15 be reaching out you to because all the materials they 16 received directed them to the English company, not to 17 the American company. 18 MR.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. Can I ask you -

7 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.

8 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, first, the word

9 "distributor" hurts you, so I'm going to take that out,

10 and I imagine a hypothetical -- I know your case differs

11 from that, but I'm going to ask them how it differs, not

12 you, okay?

13 Now, a person walks into a shop in either

14 West Virginia or the country of India where they make

15 pots. They're very nice pots made, actually, in West

16 Virginia. And the potter makes several thousand a year,

17 and this individual says: Mr. Potter, I want to sell

18 your pots; send me a thousand each year. Where are you

19 going to sell them? Everywhere. Great.

20 Okay? That's it. Now, suppose that the law

21 were, as it could be perhaps, that it is sufficient for

22 jurisdiction throughout the United States that the

23 distributor or independent buyer said good, I'm selling

24 them everywhere I can. And two or three end up in New

25 Mexico, but it doesn't matter where they end up.

2 You've prepared for this case. I want to

3 know in your opinion, if that were the rule -- that's

4 all that's necessary -- what cases in this Court in your

5 opinion would that conflict with? I mean, I'm thinking

6 of the facts. I'm not thinking of statements of law or

7 whatever, but you can bring those in, too. I want to

8 write those down because I want to read those cases, and

17 test, that those -

19 convenience test is. Assume I'm very ignorant, which

20 isn't too far from the truth. I would like you to tell

21 me, are there any cases which we would actually be

22 conflicting with were we to say all that's necessary to

23 assert jurisdiction in every State is that a buyer walks

FERGENSON: I believe that that 6 conflicts, Your Honor, with Asahi. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Asahi, okay. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Asahi -- Asahi, 9 Mr. Fergenson, was a litigation between a Japanese 10 component part manufacturer and a Taiwanese finished 11 product manufacturer. What -- how in the world could 12 you compare that case, which really has nothing at all 13 to do with the United States? It's -- it's a Japanese 14 valve manufacturer sells the valve to a tire maker in 15 Taiwan, and there should be -- that suit should go 16 forward in the United States? 17 I can see it going forward in -- in Japan, 18 but it has no connection with the United States. And 19 how can you possibly compare that with this case where 20 somebody was injured by a machine that malfunctions, 21 allegedly? 22 There was something very interesting you 23 said in your brief. And you said the U.K., which you - 24 you say -- now you've added Ohio, but you said U.K. 25 would be the place for Mr. Nicastro to go. It provides

2 What would be your answer if the

3 manufacturer, same arrangement with a distributor, sell

4 anyplace in the United States you can, is from China?

5 Would you give the same answer?

6 MR. FERGENSON: Your Honor, I would have to

7 look at -- and -- and the answer would not be, off the

8 cuff, the same. It would not be flatly the same.

9 There's been a recent decision by Judge Chasanow on

10 melamine in which Chasanow applied the availability law

11 that this Court has set forth in Piper and Gulf Oil

12 and -- and the other cases that follow, and determined

13 that China was an available forum for the plaintiffs

14 suing for the harm to their children from tainted milk.

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you made a point

16 about the trusted legal system. Well, let's say it was

17 Russia, Mexico -- you may pick any one. The machine is

18 manufactured in one of those countries where it's not so

19 certain that there's a trusted legal system.

20 MR. FERGENSON: That's correct, Your Honor.

21 And so under Piper, Gulf Oil -- and I can't remember the

22 name of the other case that Judge Chasanow relied

23 upon -- they are difficult cases, and the ability of the

24 court to determine whether the other forum is available

25 is quite cabined. And they are difficult, Your Honor.

Thank you. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you. 6 Mr. Ross. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDER W. ROSS, JR., 8 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 9 MR. ROSS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 "All we wish to do is sell our products in 12 the States and get paid." That's what the British 13 manufacturer said. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if he said we 15 want to do that, but we don't like New Jersey, so don't 16 sell our products in New Jersey, and the Ohio company 17 nonetheless does so? Can you get them -- can you hale 18 them into court in New Jersey? 19 MR. ROSS: I would say under those 20 circumstances, yes, because the purpose that -- this 21 particular manufacturer purposefully availed themselves 22 of the entire U.S. market. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he said: But I 24 have no intention of selling in New Jersey; I'm afraid I 25 might get sued there, and I don't want to get sued

27 1 there. He is not entering the stream of commerce in the 2 United States. He's entering a stream of commerce that 3 detours around New Jersey. 4 MR. ROSS: So every State with the exception 5 of New Jersey -- is that the hypothetical, Your Honor? 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 7 MR. ROSS: Then I would say under those 8 circumstances, yes, New Jersey would be excluded. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, it would be 10 excluded? 11 MR. ROSS: Yes. If the manufacturer - 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it depends on the 13 intent of the manufacturer? 14 MR. ROSS: I think it's the intent and the 15 additional conduct of the manufacturer, Your Honor. I 16 think, as Justice O'Connor said in the Asahi case -- she 17 gave several examples. I think we'd meet all those 18 examples under the circumstances of this case. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if a manufacturer 20 tells a distributor: You have international 21 distribution authority; you can sell my machine anywhere 22 in the world, sell as many as you can anywhere in the 23 world -- that would include the United States, right? 24 MR. ROSS: That is correct, Your Honor. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: And, therefore, it would

28

2 MR. ROSS: Under those circumstances, of

3 course, which are different from our case, it would seem

4 to me -

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I know; it's a

6 hypothetical.

7 MR. ROSS: Of course, of course. But the

8 fact of the matter is if the manufacturer purposefully

9 availed itself of -- of the market which would include

10 the world and had a distributor for the entire world and

11 did -

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: It would include New

13 Jersey.

14 MR. ROSS: Yes, it would.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Purposeful availment of the

16 government of New Jersey?

17 MR. ROSS: I would say the manufacturer has

18 to take some additional conduct.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, availment doesn't

20 mean much if that's all it means.

21 MR. ROSS: Well, if -

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: You tell somebody

23 distribute in the world and you are availing yourself of

25 MR. ROSS: If there is purposeful availment

1 and additional conduct, Your Honor. In this case,

29

2 that's what we have here.

3 JUSTICE BREYER: Additional conduct?

4 MR. ROSS: Correct.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: What I have written down in

6 my notes, which you can add to -

7 MR. ROSS: Sure.

8 JUSTICE BREYER: -- is that there are three

9 things that happened. One -- it's the equivalent of the

10 potter. One thing that happened, we have to take it as,

11 I think, an independent company, whether you want to

12 call them a distributor or not. I didn't see a

13 difference there. An independent company goes to a firm

14 somewhere in the world and says: I will buy your

15 product and sell it in the United States. And the guy

16 says good. And that's true whether it's a woman's

17 cooperative in southern India or whether it's the

18 biggest company in the world, okay? That's the first

19 thing.

20 The second thing is that an executive of

21 that company went to seven trade shows in the United

22 States.

23 And the third thing is that two, three, or

24 four machines ended up in New Jersey.

25 Now, is there anything other than that? And
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
30 1 there's a lot of rhetoric, and there are all kinds of 2 characterizations, but when I looked for facts, I found 3 those three, and I want to be sure I have them all. 4 MR. ROSS: You do, Your Honor. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: I do. Now, then my 6 question following from that, if I have those are the 7 three facts, what worries me is the exact opposite of 8 what the New -- the New Jersey Supreme Court said. It 9 said in worldwide markets this is a good thing. I think 10 I worry about it, because I'm worried about the woman's 11 cooperative in India, I'm worried about the Chinese 12 development, I'm worried about development everywhere. 13 We have a lot of small businesses. And I'd worry - 14 now, maybe the worry is legally irrelevant -- but I'd 15 worry about a rule of law that subjects every small 16 business in every developing company -- in every 17 developing country to have to be aware of the law in 50 18 States simply because they agreed to sell to an 19 independent company who is going to sell to America, 20 plus your two factors. 21 And really the third is none, because if it 22 hadn't ended up somewhere, there'd have been no 23 accident. 24 MR. ROSS: I would say - 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's my basic
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 concern here.

31

2 MR. ROSS: I would say in -- in response to

3 your hypothetical question, that because there was

4 purposeful availment where they came to the United

5 States, attended trade shows in an effort to sell their

6 product to anyone who would come to that trade show

7 throughout the United States, and those sales were in

8 fact consummated, then in that case I think that the

9 manufacturer has done more than just intend to sell.

10 They have taken certain positive steps.

11 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay, but you see

12 what my -- my problem is a sort of policy problem that

13 may be irrelevant, but I -- I don't see how the world's

14 going to work or develop if in fact every small business

15 everywhere in the world has to know, you know, the law

16 of every 50 States and hire lawyers and come here,

17 rather than making the accident victim go there.

18 Now, it's tough on the accident victim, but

19 the other is also tough. So -- so that's -- that's sort

20 of the -- I'm sketching out my concerns here. You -

21 MR. ROSS: I understand.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: All right.

23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is -

32

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

3 MR. ROSS: In -- in my judgment, it's not

4 enough to just have intent; it's not enough just to send

5 the product out on -- adrift on the stream of commerce.

6 There has to be some additional conduct, some concrete

7 steps taken. And I believe -

8 JUSTICE BREYER: Trade shows.

9 MR. ROSS: -- in your hypothetical,

10 attending the trade shows, perhaps hiring a distributor,

11 selling the products -

12 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's the same as

13 the first; that's a sale to the entity.

14 MR. ROSS: That's right. So I think those

15 are the additional concrete steps that were taken in

16 your hypothetical.

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ross -

18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Ross, do you think if

19 there's a small business in the United States that sells

20 a product and that actively seeks to serve a foreign

21 market -- maybe it's Great Britain, maybe it's China -

22 and that product blows up in that foreign country --

23 Great Britain, China -- do you think that the

24 manufacturer, the American manufacturer, is subject to

25 jurisdiction there?
Alderson Reporting Company

33 1 MR. ROSS: Yes. If they actively seek the 2 market there, they have purposefully availed themselves, 3 they have taken - 4 JUSTICE KAGAN: All -- all over the world 5 this is true; is that right? 6 MR. ROSS: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it is a 8 jurisdictional rule that civil law systems have always 9 had. 10 MR. ROSS: That's correct, Your Honor. I 11 believe - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- and I assume that if 13 we do this to a company in England, any country in the 14 world, and we say that this satisfies due process, we 15 would have to honor a judgment from Bangladesh based 16 upon -- against an American company, based upon a 17 similarly modest degree of -- of availment, right? 18 MR. ROSS: Well, Your Honor, it depends on 19 the extent of the availment, I would say, under those 20 circumstances. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just as -- just as modest 22 as what you propose here, or as extensive. I don't mean 23 to demean the degree of it here. 24 MR. ROSS: It seems to me -- if there's - 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the same kind of

2 States in India. And -- strike Bangladesh. Make it

3 Madras, okay?

4 MR. ROSS: All right.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: And we would have to honor

6 a judgment by a court of Madras against an American

7 manufacturer who had as little contact with Madras as

8 exists here.

9 MR. ROSS: I would say under -- yes.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: We would have to?

11 MR. ROSS: Yes, I would say.

12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Ross, we do that now;

13 isn't that right?

14 MR. ROSS: That's correct, Your Honor.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: We do? We do? So if

16 someone goes into a shop in West Virginia and buys a

17 thousand pots and says I'm going to sell them in Madras,

18 or I might sell them anywhere in the world -

19 MR. ROSS: That's a slightly -

20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and then that

21 manufacturer, that potter in West Virginia, now has to

22 go to wherever he ends up -- wherever that pot ends up?

23 MR. ROSS: That's a slightly different

24 scenario in my judgment, Your Honor -

25 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah. Ah.
Alderson Reporting Company

35 1 MR. ROSS: -- because the distributor came 2 to the manufacturer. In this case, the manufacturer 3 from Britain hired - 4 JUSTICE BREYER: We turn it on that? We 5 turn it on whether the independent buyer -- the 6 independent buyer walked into the shop or whether the 7 seller found that there was an independent buyer? Is 8 that what this case should turn on? 9 I mean, I'm nervous. I see a lot of rather 10 deep issues here, and I -- that's what are making me 11 nervous. 12 MR. ROSS: I understand, Your Honor. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: I want to - 14 MR. ROSS: I understand that. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: You've thought about it 16 more than I. So - 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we go back to Justice 18 Scalia's question? I mean, the United States has been 19 telling the rest of the world: We do recognize and 20 enforce your judgments - 21 MR. ROSS: I think - 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if there is a -- a 23 proper jurisdictional basis. 24 MR. ROSS: That's correct, Your Honor. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We do, and we would like

1 you to recognize ours. And we don't get that

36

2 reciprocity, but we still are trying to get it.

3 MR. ROSS: That's correct.

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the United States has

5 taken a very neighborly view about recognizing and

6 enforcing foreign judgments.

7 MR. ROSS: Yes, Your Honor. I -

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true when there's a

9 proper jurisdictional basis, which is what we're talking

10 about here: What does the United States mean when it

11 says there is a proper jurisdictional basis? Is all

12 that the court in Madras needs what existed here in

13 order to hold an -- an American manufacturer liable?

14 That's -- that's a little scary.

15 MR. ROSS: Well, Your Honor, if the

16 corporation, the manufacturer, is purposefully availing

17 itself of the Madras market and hires a distributor to

18 go to Madras and to sell its products, then indeed I

19 don't see why a court in Madras would not have -- and

20 the product explodes or causes some horrific -

21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it really, to you -

22 are you saying that Justice Breyer's hypothetical

23 creates jurisdiction, that the mere sale to a

24 distributor anywhere creates jurisdiction, wherever that

25 distributor is marketing the manufacturer's product?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
37 1 I thought because, in the hypothetical he 2 created, it was they were availing themselves of the 3 U.S. market because they were marketing. They went to 4 seven trade shows. They did merely -- they did 5 something more than the sale. So where's your -- what's 6 your position? 7 MR. ROSS: My position is exactly what Your 8 Honor has just stated. They have to do something more 9 than just sell. There has to be purposeful availment. 10 There has to be some concrete action, attending trade 11 shows, designing the product for the market. 12 JUSTICE ALITO: What -- what difference does 13 attending some trade shows in the United States mean - 14 make? Suppose they're -- they didn't attend any trade 15 shows. They just have a Web site that provides a 16 description of the product. 17 MR. ROSS: I think - 18 JUSTICE ALITO: Would there be no 19 jurisdiction then? 20 MR. ROSS: Well, it depends on the Web site. 21 But in my judgment, attending trade shows is a large 22 factor that is unique in this case. As I pointed out in 23 our briefs, they were -- they didn't just attend a trade 24 show; they attended trade shows throughout the United 25 States to sell this product.

ROSS: Not in the State of New Jersey, 3 but a lot of other places. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the New Jersey 5 company that bought this machine find out about it? 6 MR. ROSS: Well, Mr. Curcio, who was 7 Mr. Nicastro's employer, went to one of these 8 conventions, trade shows, in Las Vegas, where he saw the 9 machine. And at that trade show the British 10 manufacturer shared a booth with the -- its American 11 distributor. And that's where Mr. Curcio, Mr. 12 Nicastro's employer, saw the machine, and that's why he 13 decided to buy it there. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What difference does 15 it make that they go to a trade show somewhere other 16 than New Jersey? We have the notion that they're 17 availing themselves of the -- the entire United States 18 market. That's -- I'll accept that. 19 MR. ROSS: Right. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does the trade 21 show in Nevada add to the jurisdictional ties to New 22 Jersey? 23 MR.

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With Nevada?

3 MR. ROSS: With -- no, with New Jersey,

4 because the British manufacturer was there. He was in a

5 booth. A New Jersey person came to the booth and said

6 that's a great machine. There was some kind of

7 interaction. The record is unclear as to what it was,

8 but the result was the British manufacturer wound up

9 selling its product -

23 distributor acting under the direction, guidance, and

5 person from New Jersey.

6 MR. ROSS: He was -

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: He told them to talk to

8 people.

9 MR. ROSS: He was prepared to sell to

10 anyone. Whether it was from New Jersey or Massachusetts

11 or Connecticut, it didn't matter as long as the sale was

12 into the United States and the manufacturer got the

13 economic benefit of it.

14 JUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Ross, isn't the

15 point that he was selling by using large convention

16 sites in the United States, expecting that people from

17 other States would show up to those large convention

18 sites?

19 I know that Justice Alito doesn't want to

20 hear this, but New Jersey doesn't have all that many

21 large convention sites like Las Vegas does. Newark -

11 themselves of the market in Montana when there's no

14 attends one of these trade shows and decides to purchase

15 one of these machines, that -

The manufacturer, as I asked earlier, 7 may decide I don't want to sell New Jersey. 8 MR. ROSS: Right. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The manufacturer may 10 reasonably assume his machines aren't going to be in 11 Montana because there's no scrap metal business in 12 Montana. So I'm just trying to see if there are 13 limitations to your theory about the stream of commerce 14 covers everything. 15 MR. ROSS: Yes, Your Honor. The answer is 16 yes, there are limitations. There are those 17 limitations, and I think the best way of -- of stating 18 it would be if there is purposeful availment of entering 19 a market and you sell the product into that market, you 20 take these additional steps plus the intent, plus the 21 additional - 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, but the 23 market cannot be simply the United States, because you 24 carve out New Jersey if the manufacturer does, you carve 25 out Montana if --

5 this -- this area of law has treated States as if

6 they're foreign countries, in a certain way analogous

8 you said at one point, that if an independent company

9 comes to a business, however small, in the United States

For example, if there's an 8 injury in Belgium and the machine is manufactured in 9 Britain, someone is hurt in Belgium, according to those 10 conventions, then the person in Belgium could sue the 11 British company in Belgium. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Did you refer to that?

The United 21 States is not a signatory to that convention. But the 22 hypothetical was -- and I tried to answer the 23 hypothetical. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does your argument depend 25 on whether the manufacturer is the manufacturer of the
Alderson Reporting Company

1 whole machine as opposed to a component part, like

47

2 Asahi? Suppose there was a little battery or lever that

3 was manufactured, I don't know, in France, and it was

4 sent over to this English manufacturer, and they were -

5 this part is incorporated in many different kinds of

6 machines, but the part then -- and then the facts are

7 the same: It goes to the Ohio distributor and New

8 Jersey, but the part is what causes the injury.

9 What results?

10 MR. ROSS: I would say no jurisdiction for a

11 component manufacturer under those circumstances, unless

12 the component manufacturer was deliberately

13 manufacturing a product for sale into a State in the

14 United States -

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's like Justice

16 Breyer's hypothetical. He wants to sell to the entire

17 universe if he can.

18 MR. ROSS: That's correct, but the

19 manufacturer in your hypothetical did not purposefully

20 avail itself of the United States market. He simply

21 sold a component part.

22 And this is, of course, not a component part

23 case we have here before us. So he may have known -

24 there might have been foreseeability that it was

25 possible that.... That's not enough.

48 1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if -

2 MR. ROSS: We're not saying that's enough.

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's say he does

4 know, it's a component part for something that is sold,

5 widely sold, in the United States. Or it's a component

6 part of this machine.

7 MR. ROSS: Our position is that under those

8 circumstances, if the manufacturer did not purposefully

9 avail itself of the United States market by hiring a

10 distributor -

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But why would it

12 be -

13 MR. ROSS: -- it wouldn't be targeting that

14 market.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you have an

16 entirely different test.

17 MR. ROSS: As to components. I'm sorry.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have -- you have

19 an entirely different test for a component manufacturer

20 than you do for the finished product manufacturer. The

21 component manufacturer may well know to a certainty that

22 his component is going to be used in a product that's

23 sold in the United States.

24 Let's say he makes a component for this

25 machine.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. ROSS: Right.

49

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that

3 different? Shouldn't it be the same test?

4 MR. ROSS: I think it's different. And

5 that's where the limitation of the Due Process Clause, I

6 think, comes into play because that manufacturer, making

7 a small component, a spring, a small part for a large

8 machine like in the Asahi case, he may not -- he may

9 have known. It's foreseeable that this product will go

10 there, but -

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He makes -- let's

12 say he makes the 25-inch blade that only goes into this

13 machine. That's the only market for it. Does -- no

14 difference?

15 MR. ROSS: I would say there is a

16 difference, because that component -

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. That was

18 poorly phrased. Is it the same test for the machine, or

19 is it a different test? Is it your component test?

20 MR. ROSS: I think it's -- I think it's the

21 same test, but it would come out differently for the

22 component manufacturer. That's the way I'd like to -

23 JUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Fergenson, isn't

24 that what Justice O'Connor said in Asahi, that the

25 component manufacturer may have all the knowledge in the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 world -- for Justice Brennan, that was enough; for

50

2 Justice O'Connor, it was not enough, that knowledge was

3 insufficient, that there had to be purposeful availment,

4 that there had to be an active decision, a choice to

5 seek the market. And -- and I understand that, on your

6 view, McIntyre made that choice.

7 MR. ROSS: Exactly.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can there not -

9 how can there possibly not be purposeful availment if

10 the manufacturer of the 25-inch blade knows it's only

11 going to be used in McIntyre's machine and it knows that

12 McIntyre is trying to sell its machine in the United

13 States?

14 MR. ROSS: Because the manufacturer of that

15 blade did not specifically target the United States

16 market. He -

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He put it in a

18 product that is only going to be -- that he knows is

19 going to be sold in the United States.

20 MR. ROSS: But it's not specifically

21 designed for them. And that -- that machine is not

22 specifically designed for the U.S. market. That

23 machine -

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have a

25 partnership. One of the partners makes the shell of the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 machine; the other partner makes the insides of the

51

2 machine. Are they, as individual companies -- are they

3 availing themselves of the United States market?

4 MR. ROSS: Now, under those circumstances, I

5 would think there would be a difference. I think there

6 would be a difference because they are combined in

7 joining to market into the United States. But if this

8 is a -- a manufacturer of blades in Birmingham, England,

9 and the manufacturer of blades in Birmingham, England,

10 sends it to Nottingham, England, and then something

11 happens in New Jersey, and all the facts are the same, I

12 would say Birmingham is off the hook.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose the company in

14 Nottingham only sells to the United States. It's the

15 only place its machines are -- are marketed.

16 MR. ROSS: That would be different then.

17 Then there -- there is more than that. There -

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Then the component

19 manufacturer would be liable in New Jersey?

20 MR. ROSS: Because he is basically

21 piggybacking on the actions of the manufacturer.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. What about

23 today, is there any difference between the trade show -

24 and he did show up at seven trade shows. I -- I mean,

25 the manufacturer here had a representative at several
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 trade shows, you're right.

52

2 MR. ROSS: Twenty-six.

3 JUSTICE BREYER: That's right. Twenty -

4 no, well, the record said seven.

5 MR. ROSS: There were 26 trade shows.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that in the record?

7 MR. ROSS: Yes, it is. Joint Appendix 114

8 to 117a.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. All right. Is there

10 a difference between that, do you think, and -- I just

11 read in the paper the other day there's some Ethiopian

12 or some foreign country -- it's a very poor country -

13 and they're selling goats, and they're sending some to

14 the United States for some kind of festival purpose or

15 something. Now, he said I have a site on the Internet.

16 All right.

17 Now, all of these people, however small, I

18 mean, many, many will have Internet sites, and some of

19 them might have an Internet site that's accessed by

20 American buyers, as this man did.

21 MR. ROSS: Right.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Is there any

23 difference between that and your trade shows?

24 MR. ROSS: And if the goat poisons someone

25 in the United States and the -- and the person who
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 raised the goat -

53

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

3 MR. ROSS: -- purposefully availed itself -

4 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, don't use the

5 characterization. I mean, I'm -- see, I'm trying to

6 figure out does this count as purposefully availed?

7 MR. ROSS: If -- if they take steps,

8 concrete steps, additional conduct, then yes. The

9 answer is yes.

10 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So the answer is

11 going to be, in this case, if we say you win -

12 MR. ROSS: Sadly, even if -

13 JUSTICE BREYER: -- then everyone with a -

14 with a -- everyone with an Internet site who also sells

15 to a buyer who says anywhere in the world, perhaps -- I

16 don't know how far that reaches -- seems pretty filled

17 with implications.

18 MR. ROSS: Yes, it does. The Internet -- we

19 deliberately did not raise the Internet or any Web sites

20 in our briefs.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: But it's the same, you

22 think? It's the same -- I thought it might -

23 MR. ROSS: I think if there's purposeful

24 availment and if the Internet is being used to market

25 specifically into the United States and the product

1 causes harm to someone in the United States -

54

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there -- there are

3 some cases just beginning -- at the beginning stages,

4 aren't there, involving sales through the Internet?

5 MR. ROSS: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. I believe

6 that those cases say if there's an interactive Web site;

7 in other words, if the person sitting in the United

8 States can press several buttons on its computer and

9 interact and make -- consummate the transaction, if you

10 will, with the foreign manufacturer, then under those

11 circumstances, I believe, the trend of the cases seems

12 to be that there would be jurisdiction.

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but you were cut

14 off before you finished your answer. I want to make

15 sure I understood it. I -- I make the inference that

16 you -- you would say that if there is an advertisement,

17 not a sale, just an advertisement on the Internet,

18 replacing the trade show, that that is a significant

19 availment -- a purposeful availment, and there can be

20 jurisdiction in New Jersey. Same factors here -

21 somebody who doesn't go to the U.S. trade shows, but he

22 does put it on the Internet, the same result?

23 MR. ROSS: That was one of the four examples

24 that Justice O'Connor gave us in Asahi, advertising

25 for --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
55 1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I want to know what your 2 position is. 3 MR. ROSS: Yes. My position is yes, because 4 they are -- they are attempting to sell into the United 5 States with advertising. But the trend of the decisions 6 has been that it has to be an interactive Web site. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can -- maybe 8 everybody knows this except me. Do you -- are Web sites 9 targeted to the United States? Don't you -- you can - 10 let's say they put it on their Web site in England. 11 Can't you -- can't -- can't I access that from here? 12 MR. ROSS: Yes, you can. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they don't even 14 have to send the Web site to the United States? They 15 just have to have a Web site? 16 MR. ROSS: If it's an interactive Web site 17 where you can sit in New Jersey, order a product, the 18 product is then delivered by the foreign manufacturer 19 into New Jersey, and the product then chops off four 20 fingers of someone's hand - 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it has to be 22 interactive? 23 MR. ROSS: Yes, Your Honor. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's just -- what 25 if it says, here, we're McIntyre -- on a Web site -- we

Official - Subject to Final Review
56 1 make these machines; give us a call at this number if 2 you want to buy one? 3 MR. ROSS: Not enough. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not enough? 5 MR. ROSS: That's like a billboard. That's 6 not enough. That's just a pure advertising; not enough. 7 But if the additional steps that I just mentioned are 8 taken and a sale occurs - 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And this distinction 10 is somewhere in the Due Process Clause? 11 MR. ROSS: I believe that the Due Process 12 Clause requires the additional conduct. The purposeful 13 availment, which is what we have in your hypothetical, 14 and the actual transaction, the sale, then we have 15 jurisdiction. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But was the sale here 17 negotiated in -- or part of the sale negotiated in 18 Nevada or the person just -- the New Jersey manufacturer 19 just was interested in the machine and then later 20 contacted the Ohio distributor? 21 MR. ROSS: In this case, the manufacturer 22 said that they own the machines until they're paid for 23 in full. The machine was not paid for in full. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, I'm -- I'm trying to 25 relate what happened here to the Internet hypothetical.

1 I have the -

57

2 MR. ROSS: Right.

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- Internet hypothetical

4 where there's just an advertisement.

5 MR. ROSS: Right.

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And, at first, I thought

7 you were saying that's sufficient. Now you say no,

8 because they have to be part of the contract. I'm

9 trying to make the Internet equivalent to the trade

10 show.

11 MR. ROSS: If the Internet Web site is

12 interactive, so you can sit in New Jersey, order the

13 product, complete the transaction, send money, and in

14 response to the money coming, you get a product -

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. But not just an

16 advertisement?

17 MR. ROSS: Not just an advertisement.

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even though that's the

19 cause for the buyer's interest in it and he pursues -

20 pursues his -- his transaction after finding out all the

21 information on the Internet, but he phones the Ohio

22 distributor?

23 MR. ROSS: It's not enough, in my judgment,

24 if -- under the Internet example that you just gave. If

25 there's an interactive Web site where the person in New

58 1 Jersey can press buttons on his computer and complete 2 the transaction with the result that the product comes 3 to New Jersey, under those circumstances, I would say 4 there is jurisdiction. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Complete? He's got 6 to complete the transaction? 7 MR. ROSS: That's correct. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it's - 9 MR. ROSS: I don't - 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you know, punch 11 these numbers, and we will send you an application for a 12 machine? Is that not enough, because he's got to 13 complete the transaction? 14 MR. ROSS: I would say, under those 15 circumstances, that that's part of what the manufacturer 16 requires, but the end result is that the machine winds 17 up in New Jersey through this contact between the person 18 and the manufacturer. Then I would say that would be 19 enough for jurisdiction. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if they say 21 fill this out, and contact this person, McIntyre, 22 whatever, in Ohio, that's where you can get one of our 23 machines -- that's enough? 24 MR. ROSS: I would say, in that case, they 25 have deliberately targeted the entire United States

16 MR. FERGENSON: Thank you, Your Honor.

17 Justice Breyer, I would -- in response to

18 your concern, I would ask you to look at page 29 of the

19 States' amicus brief: "Ignorance of the fact that New

20 Jersey is a State within our union, or of the specifics

21 of New Jersey products liability law, should not allow

22 Petitioner to avoid jurisdiction. Its own lack of

23 research prior to embarking on a nationwide marketing

60 1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you answer - 2 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- could I ask you a 3 question? 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Could you - 5 just one quick point of clarification. 6 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's a point that your 8 adversary raised in passing. I'm not quite sure, do you 9 sell outright to the American company? Do you ship a 10 product and they pay you, or they only pay you when they 11 receive the money from their customer? There appears to 12 be some suggestion of the latter. 13 MR. FERGENSON: And the New Jersey Supreme 14 Court said that there was a suggestion that some trades 15 could have been by consignment. I believe that that is 16 outside of this -- taken out of this case by an 17 admission in the brief -- at least for this sale -- in 18 the brief in opposition to defendant's motion to 19 dismiss, at 19-20, filed October 11th, 2006, where they 20 state -- where Respondent states it was sold by us to 21 MMA, and it was sold by MMA to Curcio Scrap Metal. 22 So, there is no consignment. There's no 23 consignment under 9-102, which Ohio has adopted. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's a different 25 question than I asked. There was no consignment on this

2 MR. FERGENSON: Yes.

3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're not claiming

4 that there might not be on others?

5 MR. FERGENSON: The evidence in the record

6 under 9-102, which Ohio has adopted, I think can only be

7 reasonably viewed -- and this Court obviously treats it

8 as de novo, on a jurisdictional review -- can only be

9 viewed as not a consignment because MMA was in the

10 business of selling the products to others.

11 Let me say that for the -- there was no

12 interaction in the record with anyone from New Jersey by

13 MMA or by J. McIntyre. It was the booth, and then there

14 was an order. And if you look at the invoice, it says

15 verbal order. There was an order by the son of the

16 owner of Curcio Metal Works, and that's it. The order

17 was fulfilled.

18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fergenson, Toyota,

19 Honda, Volkswagen -- pick your car company -- sells many

20 millions of cars to the United States. They start

21 blowing up here. They operate through independent

22 distributors only. Can they be subject to jurisdiction
