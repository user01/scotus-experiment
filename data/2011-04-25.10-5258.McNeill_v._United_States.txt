1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:00 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument next this morning in Case 10-5258, McNeill v. 5 United States. 6 Mr. Gordon. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN C. GORDON 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. GORDON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 When this Court construes a statute, the 12 words of the statute matter, the purpose of the statute 13 matters, and the results produced by that construction 14 matter. 15 When Congress defined in the Armed Career 16 Criminal Act a "serious" drug offense as one for which a 17 State penalty of 10 years or more is prescribed by law, 18 it meant for Federal courts to look to the law presently 19 in effect in that State. This is the most natural 20 reading of the statute, and words matter. It is also 21 consistent with ACCA's purpose, which is punish the 22 Federal firearms offense, and if we are going to 23 punish - 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I -- I have 25 just one problem, which is under your theory, I
3

1 understand it, if a State increases a penalty, makes 2 what would have been a penalty for a misdemeanor now a 3 felony, then that defendant is a career criminal, by 4 your logic. 5 MR. GORDON: Uh - 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the person who 7 thought that at the time they committed the crime they 8 were committing a low-level crime is now a felon; is 9 that your theory of the case? 10 MR. GORDON: If -- if a State were to 11 increase a penalty -- say from originally it was 5 12 years, increased it to 10 years, the defendant was 13 convicted at a time when it was 5 years -- if the 14 legislature increased the penalty, if the defendant 15 possessed a firearm, yes, he would be facing - 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What -- what -- what 17 logic do you think there is in that, why Congress would 18 want to punish someone now for -- for criminal activity 19 that they thought was lesser, and the State thought was 20 lesser, at an earlier time, less reprehensible? 21 MR. GORDON: Because the purpose of the 22 Armed Career Criminal Act is not to enhance a sentence 23 because of the prior conviction. It is because the 24 Federal firearm offense at the time it was committed is 25 more serious based on -- based on its repetitive nature,
4

1 as this Court has said. So therefore looking to, when 2 the defendant commits the offense, what his status is at 3 that time under the law we think makes sense and is 4 consonant with the purpose of what ACCA is trying to do. 5 ACCA is not trying to punish the State offense at the 6 time. 7 And of course the converse, Your Honor, is 8 that by adopting the government's reading, is 9 individuals who at a time committed an offense when a 10 State at that time viewed an offense as more serious but 11 now has changed its view of the offense, does not view 12 it as being as serious, that person also would receive a 13 15-year mandatory minimum sentence. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gordon, the State 15 does regard it -- it does -- prescribe 10 years for this 16 defendant because it's made a -- made the change not 17 retroactive. So a maximum of 10 years is prescribed for 18 Mr. McNeill, and all others who committed the offense 19 prior to the change in law. So it is -- it is the 20 State's current position that for this offense the 21 maximum is 10 years. 22 MR. GORDON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's 23 correct. Where we fundamentally disagree with the 24 government and with the Fourth Circuit is on the 25 significance of retroactivity. We -- the statute
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 requires -- or the statute directs us to look at the 2 penalty that is prescribed for the offense, the offense 3 in its generic context. It -- it is not about what the 4 circumstances of the defendant were that produced the 5 particular conviction for him. 6 No one who commits the trafficking offenses 7 that Mr. McNeill committed today is going to be facing a 8 10-year sentence. It's not going to happen to anyone 9 who commits the offense from today forward. And we 10 think that is where the statute directs us to look: 11 What is the penalty for the generic offense? 12 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose -- what would happen 13 in this situation? A defendant is convicted under a 14 State statute that says that anybody who sells between 1 15 ounces -- 1 ounce and 5 ounces of a particular 16 controlled substance is guilty of a felony and may be 17 punished by imprisonment for a certain amount of time. 18 And then the State repeals that provision 19 altogether and enacts a new provision that says anybody 20 who sells between 1 ounces -- 1 ounce and 8 ounces is 21 punishable by a certain penalty. And now the question 22 comes up what -- what penalty does the court look at 23 with respect to the earlier offense that no longer 24 exists for which the defendant was convicted? 25 MR. GORDON: There -- there are two possible
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 answers, Justice Alito. First, the court could look to 2 what the offense is now, could look back to what the 3 defendant did consistent with Shepard and so forth, and 4 see if the defendant's conviction contains the element 5 of the -- the elements that apply to the present 6 offense. 7 If the court could not do that, then the 8 conviction would count for purposes of the defendant's 9 criminal history. It would not count as an ACCA 10 predicate, and the district court would then be limited 11 to a 10-year sentence as opposed to a 15-to-life 12 sentence. 13 So consistent with -- with its purpose, we 14 think that the statute should be read as speaking to the 15 time, not of the State conviction -- not of the State 16 sentence. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mis - 18 MR. GORDON: Yes? 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gordon, is this -- is 20 this essentially an academic question? Because this 21 district judge said that he would impose the same 22 sentence as a variant even if he couldn't do it under 23 the guidelines, even if it were an incorrect 24 calculation. He said: This criminal record is violent 25 and astonishing; essentially, I'm going to throw the
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 book at him, and I'm going to do it through a variant if 2 that's no -- if there's no other way. 3 So isn't that -- I mean, isn't this an -- an 4 exercise, essentially an academic exercise, if -- if 5 your -- your client would end up in the same place? 6 MR. GORDON: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it may 7 be an academic exercise for Mr. McNeill or for the Mr. 8 McNeills of the world. The judge would -- if this Court 9 were to agree with us, the judge could impose 10 consecutive sentences on a remand and still achieve the 11 same sentence, yes. 12 For someone whose only offense, however, is 13 a 922(g) conviction, then it makes a huge difference 14 because, rather than looking at a 15-year mandatory 15 minimum penalty, the defendant would be looking at no 16 more than 10 years. So, the judge's -- it would be 17 significantly cabined in -- in that sense. 18 And the other, with respect to the Mr. 19 McNeills of the world, the judge on a remand is still 20 going to be required to calculate the guidelines 21 correctly. And so if the guidelines change, if they go 22 down in this case, for the judge to achieve a 300-month 23 sentence, the judge is going to have to state reasons 24 again and arguably more significant reasons to -- to 25 achieve that same level if he's working from a lower
8

1 guideline range. 2 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Gordon, there are other 3 provisions in ACCA which seem to use the present tense 4 in circumstances where it doesn't seem as though the 5 statute truly means the present tense. So, a violent 6 felony is one that "has as an element the use of 7 physical force, is burglary, arson, or extortion, 8 involves use of explosives;" and so on and so forth. 9 But we would not look as to -- in interpreting that 10 provision to the present day, would we? 11 MR. GORDON: Justice Kagan, I think you 12 would, in this sense: For the violent felony provision, 13 there is a generic offense. Let's take burglary. There 14 is this existing thing right now called burglary. What 15 a Taylor analysis does is it looks backward to what the 16 defendant did. It looks to see what those elements are. 17 It takes those elements and brings it forward, and if 18 those elements fit in the box, then what he did is a 19 burglary. If it does not, then it is not a burglary. 20 The -- so, that's my essential answer to that. Is it - 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is -- why is -- why is 22 the present tense inadequate for the -- for the 23 government's position in this case? Once it is conceded 24 that the North Carolina law is not retroactive, the law 25 reducing the number of years, it is the case that what
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 is the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense that 2 he committed -- how many years ago was it, whatever - 3 MR. GORDON: Early '90s, Your Honor. Yes, 4 '91, '92. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the maximum 6 punishment for that offense which occurred at that time 7 is the longer period. Why is -- I don't see why your 8 argument requires us to ask what would be the term if he 9 had committed the offense at a later date. The maximum 10 term for his offense when he committed it is those years 11 because the State did not retroactively reduce his 12 sentence. 13 MR. GORDON: That's correct for Mr. McNeill. 14 The penalty for him -- he would be facing an exposure of 15 10 years. The penalty, however, that everyone else - 16 the penalty that is currently prescribed in North 17 Carolina for someone who commits McNeill's offenses is 18 not 10 years and, and depending on where they fall in 19 the prior record level, their maximum sentence is 20 considerably less than 10 years. 21 So we do not think it's consonant with the 22 statute to look to the circumstances of the individual 23 defendant. Congress easily could have said "for which a 24 penalty of 10 years or more is prescribed for the 25 defendant." We think that would be a different case.
10

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not just for the 2 defendant; it's for anybody who committed it prior to 3 the -- prior to the amendment of the statute. 4 MR. GORDON: That's correct. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Anybody that committed it 6 then, the -- the -- it is an offense "involving 7 manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent 8 to manufacture or distribute a controlled...for which a 9 maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more is 10 prescribed by law." It is prescribed by law for any of 11 those offenses that occurred between whenever that old 12 statute was enacted and whenever this statute was 13 enacted. 14 MR. GORDON: It is prescribed only if you 15 take the offense out of the category of a generic 16 offense. It is not -- it is -- it is not prescribed for 17 the generic offense. It is prescribed for particular 18 defendants who committed the offense at a certain point 19 in time. 20 And, Justice Scalia, I think it raises a 21 rather fundamental question, which is if we're going - 22 if we really are punishing the Federal firearm offense 23 and we are not punishing the defendant for the prior 24 conviction, and we have two individuals who commit a 25 922(g) offense and they have similar records, but they

1 sustain their State convictions on different days, do we 2 want to treat them the same for purposes of where they 3 -- of the Federal offense or do we want to distinguish 4 them on the basis of the State convictions? Do we want 5 the State convictions to really - 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the State - 7 MR. GORDON: Yes, sir. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the State 9 change is to abolish the offense altogether? Do we - 10 do we not have any predicate offense for the defendant 11 who committed the crime prior to the abolition of the 12 State offense? 13 MR. GORDON: Your Honor, yes. If -- if, as 14 I said earlier, you could not determine from the prior 15 conviction whether there is any present State offense 16 that might be called something different, but that has 17 those drug trafficking elements that the statute 18 requires, if you cannot determine, you know, from 19 Shepard-approved documents and so forth, yes, we think 20 for purposes of the armed career criminal enhancement 21 only that that would disappear. That's correct. 22 I do want to stress, because I think it's 23 important to stress, that - 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. That's - 25 MR. GORDON: Yes?

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's correct? You're 2 happy with that? The person committed a felony when it 3 was a felony, and the State later no longer makes it a 4 felony, and it isn't counted for purposes of the Armed 5 Career Criminal Act? 6 MR. GORDON: Only for purposes of the Armed 7 Career Criminal Act, yes. It certainly would count as a 8 prior conviction. It would count as a prior conviction, 9 for example, for 922(g) purposes. This person could 10 still be prosecuted for being a felon in possession, 11 yes. 12 So, we do not -- our reading is not opening 13 the jail house door for anybody. They are still facing 14 a hefty 10-year sentence. The question is, in a statute 15 that defers to the judgment of the States to determine 16 seriousness, are we going to defer to the current State 17 assessment of what seriousness is or are we going to 18 look back to repeal the discarded judgments? 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it strikes 20 me that there's really no change in the State view of 21 how serious it is. It was just an overall change in how 22 they're going to look at sentencing. Under the prior 23 regime, you're sentenced to a particular term, but in 24 fact you serve a lot less. With the new treatment in 25 sentencing, you're sentenced to what is a much -- a
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 smaller term, but you in fact are going to serve the 2 whole thing. At the end of the day, there's no real 3 change in how they view the seriousness of the offense. 4 MR. GORDON: That's correct, Mr. Chief 5 Justice, arguably yes. But for purposes of the serious 6 drug offense definition, what we have to use is the 7 penalty. We have to look at the penalty as the State - 8 as the State's proxy, if you will, for seriousness. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are we looking at it 10 because we want the States to determine the Federal 11 sentence or are we looking at it because we evaluate the 12 evil of the particular defendant on the basis of how - 13 how much of a crime he was willing to commit? 14 And so long as it was a serious felony when 15 he committed it, this is a bad actor. I don't care if 16 the State changes its view. At the time, he was willing 17 to commit a felony that put him in jail for 10 years, 18 and that's what we're looking to, it seems to me, how 19 bad an apple is this fellow that -- that we're talking 20 about putting away? And that doesn't change simply 21 because the State decides in the future that that same 22 act will not be a felony. Well, people who perform that 23 act in the future aren't so bad; they're just -- you 24 know, just normal not-so-good people - 25 (Laughter.)
14

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- but they're not the kind 2 of a person who's willing to -- to commit a felony that, 3 you know, puts them away for 10 years. 4 It seems to me that that's what the Federal 5 law is looking to. We're not giving over to the States 6 the decision of -- of how long we should incarcerate 7 somebody in a Federal prison. 8 MR. GORDON: Justice Scalia, if -- if that 9 were indeed what Congress wanted, then it would have 10 written the statute differently. There would be 11 something in that definition about the defendant, and 12 there's not. It's about the offense. So the -- the 13 judgment that the State is making is about the 14 seriousness of the offense itself, and as we made an 15 effort to argue in our briefs, State views of drug 16 offenses change. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: I agree, it does refer to 18 the seriousness of the offense. But it refers to the 19 seriousness of the offense at the time the offense was 20 committed in order to determine how bad a fellow this 21 is, not -- not because we want the States to determine 22 how long we're going to keep Federal prisoners in 23 prison. 24 MR. GORDON: Justice Scalia, respectfully, 25 I -- I don't agree with that. Respectfully -

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the issue, though, 2 really. 3 MR. GORDON: That is an issue, yes, Justice 4 Scalia. But the issue is, do you look at the defendant. 5 Do you say Congress was really talking about trying to 6 get the Mr. McNeills any way we can or we are -- we are 7 interested in people who commit an offense that the 8 State currently regards as serious. 9 You will capture Mr. McNeills; you will also 10 capture people who, you know, under the old Texas law 11 that, you know, prescribed 99 years for someone who 12 might have sold one or two marijuana cigarettes as well. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you'll -- you'll put 14 away for a long time somebody who really wasn't that bad 15 a guy. He committed a misdemeanor, and when the State 16 later makes it a felony, you -- he suddenly comes under 17 ACCA. And I -- I can't believe that that's -- that's 18 what -- what Congress had in mind just because the State 19 now thinks that it's more serious. Who cares what the 20 State thinks? We -- we want to know how bad an actor 21 this particular defendant is. 22 MR. GORDON: In the case of a misdemeanor -23 Justice Sotomayor asked earlier about misdemeanors and 24 felonies -- there may be some additional constitutional 25 issues in terms of whether if it's a misdemeanor
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 conviction, even statutory reasons, if it's a 2 misdemeanor conviction, whether it should count. I 3 think it works that way in the violent felony prong, for 4 example, where the term that you look at is was it 1 5 year. 6 But that is -- that is not the proxy for 7 seriousness because there is another provision, 18 8 U.S.C. section 921(a)(20), that exempts 2-year 9 misdemeanors. So -- so, the 1 year in the violent 10 felony provision is not serving the same purpose that - 11 that the 10 years is in the serious drug offense. 12 A reason that Congress may have had for 13 doing that is to say that if we are going to hit 14 somebody with 15 years, we want to make sure that they 15 had their constitutional rights at the time they 16 sustained the predicate conviction, had a right to 17 counsel, indictment, jury, and so forth. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm -- I'm not sure what 19 you're urging now. Are -- are you modifying or 20 retracting the answer you gave to Justice Sotomayor, 21 that is, the case where the maximum was 5 years, but 22 then at the time of the Federal offense the State has 23 changed it so it's 10 years? 24 I -- I think you answered her question that 25 it would work the same way, that what mattered is how
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the State currently ranks the offense, not the offender. 2 But now you seem to be saying there might be a different 3 answer when the State increases rather than decreases 4 the penalty. 5 MR. GORDON: What -- what I meant to say, 6 Justice Ginsburg, is that if you are -- if you continue 7 to be talking about a felony offense, if it goes from 8 5 years to 10 years, it went from a felony to another 9 felony, in that circumstance I -- I -- I will concede 10 our reading of the statute would work to the detriment 11 of that defendant, that -- that's correct. 12 What I was simply trying to say about the 13 misdemeanor-felony is that there might be some 14 additional constitutional issues that would not be 15 present in -- if it went from 5 years to 10 years. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in the hypothetical 17 where the penalty is increased, would there be an ex 18 post facto problem? 19 MR. GORDON: Your Honor, I don't believe 20 there would be. The defendant presumptively is on 21 notice that the law has changed. 22 Now, if -- if the increase in the penalty 23 were between the time that he commits the 922(g) offense 24 and the time of the sentencing, yes, I think you have ex 25 post facto concerns there. I think if you're talking
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 about between the time of the State offense and the time 2 of the commission of the firearm offense, I don't think 3 it raises the ex post facto concerns. Again, the 4 defendant is on notice, he's presumed to know what the 5 law is at the time he commits the Federal offense, and 6 that's what we care about here. 7 I -- I would also like to return to the 8 question of retroactivity for just a moment and note 9 that in terms of the administerability of the Armed 10 Career Criminal Act, the question of retroactivity would 11 introduce, if the government's reading is adopted, 12 problems that do not exist under reading ACCA speaking 13 in the present tense. Under the government's approach, 14 it is not simply that you can look at what the sentence 15 was that the defendant received in State court. The 16 government says retroactivity matters. 17 So you would still have to go to the present 18 penalty, and then you would have to conduct an inquiry 19 into what the, you know, what changes occurred in the 20 law, were any of them retroactive, were they retroactive 21 for a certain period of time, et cetera. So, it - 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, how do you 23 see that? I thought the government had two alternative 24 positions, the first being that you look at the time - 25 at the time of the offense, at the conviction or,
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 alternatively, it was arguing the way to take the 2 position of the court below. But if you're going to use 3 the present tense then you look retroactively to see - 4 then you look to see whether the State would 5 retroactively apply the new sentence. 6 MR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You understood their 8 brief differently? 9 MR. GORDON: Your Honor, I read the brief 10 differently? If -- and if my reading is incorrect, I 11 apologize. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sure they'll tell 13 you. 14 (Laughter.) 15 MR. GORDON: Yes, I'm sure they will. 16 If there are no further questions, I would 17 like to reserve the balance of my time. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 19 Mr. Gordon. 20 Mr. Gannon. 21 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON 22 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 23 MR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 24 please the Court: 25 Petitioner was convicted under North
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Carolina law of multiple offenses subject to a 10-year 2 maximum term of imprisonment, and he actually received 3 10-year sentences for his drug crimes. He now claims 4 that those convictions are not ones for which the 5 maximum term of imprisonment is at least 10 years for 6 purposes of ACCA's definition of serious drug offense. 7 That result is incorrect, because the 8 sentencing court should consider the offense and the 9 punishment as they were defined by the body of law under 10 which the defendant was convicted and sentenced. 11 This is the simplest approach, because the 12 Court is already looking to the statute at the time of 13 the underlying conviction in order to evaluate whether 14 it satisfies the substantive component of the definition 15 of a serious drug offense. And if I can start where 16 Justice Sotomayor finished with my friend, we have one 17 footnote in the first part of our argument, footnote 5, 18 which clarifies an issue that isn't at stake here, which 19 is that when we say that you need to look to the time of 20 the underlying conviction, that that includes the time 21 of the sentencing which could include some sentence 22 modification proceedings. 23 If the State had amended the law in the 24 meantime, made it retroactively applicable and the 25 defendant were able to get his judgment or conviction

1 modified, then we would not insist that -- that he still 2 had an offense that was subject to a 10-year maximum 3 term of imprisonment. And we think that this approach 4 is consistent with what the Court said in Rodriguez, 5 where it was also evaluating the serious drug offense 6 under ACCA and pointed us to the documents associated 7 with the judgment of conviction. 8 It recognizes that the relevant question 9 here is the body of law that applied to this particular 10 defendant in his offense. And -- and it's the term 11 "conviction" that actually points us to that in the 12 statute. The question is what is the sentencing regime 13 associated with the defendant's actual conviction, and 14 the government's - 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I -- just to 16 clarify your point. If there's been a modification of 17 law that would have entitled him to a retroactive change 18 in his sentence, although I'm not quite sure how that 19 works, because if there's a modification, I thought it 20 would only apply to a defendant who had committed the 21 crime at that earlier time but was convicted at the 22 present time. This defendant wouldn't have his sentence 23 modified. 24 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that this would 25 be a highly extraordinary circumstance. There may be an

1 instance where the State legislature has actually 2 amended the law, made it retroactive and said that it's 3 applicable to people who had final convictions 4 beforehand I - 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's my 6 question. Is your footnote related to that kind of 7 individual only or are you saying -- or are you 8 accepting your adversary's argument that the circuit 9 below got it right? You look at the is as to what the 10 sentence would be today - 11 MR. GANNON: The footnote - 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- if this person had 13 committed the crime? 14 MR. GANNON: The footnote in part A of the 15 government's brief is -- is not consistent with the 16 court of appeals approach. We're saying that under our 17 principal reading which is at the relevant time, at the 18 time of the conviction, that that includes the 19 sentencing associated with that conviction; and in 20 certain unusual circumstances that may well include a 21 sentence modification proceeding that occurred sometime 22 after the fact. But in any event it's going to be a 23 previous conviction that needs to be on the books at the 24 time of the 922(g) offense. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm just trying to
23

1 clarify whether you mean that the -- the modification 2 had to have occurred, meaning that he was convicted, he 3 got 10 years, and somewhere for some State reason, that 4 actual final judgment was amended to include 5. 5 MR. GANNON: Yes. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are or are you talking 7 about - 8 MR. GANNON: Yes. 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- accepting his 10 argument that if he could apply for a change now - 11 MR. GANNON: It -- in -- we think that it 12 has to be under the documents associated with his 13 judgment of conviction. So it would matter that he had 14 been successfully able to obtain modification of the - 15 the judgment associated with his conviction. In those 16 circumstances it would be appropriate to say that the 17 body of law that applied to his conviction was one that 18 specified only the lower punishment. 19 That's obviously not an issue here because 20 the State hasn't made any of these relevant changes 21 retroactively applicable to any offense that was 22 committed before the first of October in 1994. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is this the first time 24 you're advancing the argument, the first part of your 25 argument?

1 MR. GANNON: It - 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It doesn't appear as you 3 did -- if you did it below; am I correct? 4 MR. GANNON: We -- we did not advance this 5 below. We weren't heard on the question at district 6 court. The district judge adopted this argument in 7 response to Petitioner's objection to the PSR which had 8 taken this position. In the court of appeals, 9 Petitioner relied upon the Sixth Circuit's decision in 10 Morton, and we -- we responded the essentially the way 11 the Fourth Circuit did, which is to say the Fifth 12 Circuit has distinguished instances like that when the 13 court has not -- when the State has not made the -- the 14 intervening decrease in the sentence retroactively 15 applicable. That's the interpretation that the Fourth 16 Circuit adopted. 17 But the government has made this argument 18 before in -- in the Second Circuit in Darden, in the 19 Fifth Circuit in Hinojosa, in the -- in the Sixth 20 Circuit in Morton in the 1994 decision. The government 21 has made this lead argument that we're making today in 22 addition to the fallback argument that the -- that the 23 Fourth Circuit adopted here, and that the Fifth Circuit 24 adopted in -- in Hinojosa. 25 But I would note that the lead argument that
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 we're making today has several advantages that make it 2 preferable to the fallback argument. Some of them have 3 already been brought up today. I already mentioned the 4 fact that this is simpler, because it requires the judge 5 to just look to one time to evaluate the substantive 6 component of the definition and the -- the sentence 7 component of the definition. 8 But this also prevents the types of problems 9 that Justice Alito addressed earlier that may arise when 10 the State has amended the definition of the offense. If 11 you just look to the -- the actual offense at the time 12 of the conviction, then you don't run into those sorts 13 of problems, and the Fifth Circuit recognized this in 14 its Allen decision and therefore ended up having to 15 adopt what is essentially the government's lead argument 16 here. 17 The Sixth Circuit which generally follows 18 Petitioner's rule also ended up adopting the 19 government's lead argument in the context of a 20 guidelines determination, because it recognized that it 21 -- it was unwilling to assume that a conviction simply 22 disappears when the State has modified the definitions 23 in such a way that you can't precisely translate into 24 current terms what the underlying offense of conviction 25 is.

1 The government's reading avoids that problem 2 because it doesn't require you to recharacterize the old 3 offense at all. It just says what was he convicted of? 4 What was the maximum sentence associated with that 5 offense at the time he was actually prosecuted? There's 6 nothing hypothetical about it. And as the -- as the 7 Court pointed out in Rodriguez, we would expect a lot of 8 the documents association with a judgment of conviction 9 to make this a relatively easy inquiry to answer what 10 was the maximum sentence at the relevant time. 11 This -- the reading also avoids the 12 difficulty that Justice Sotomayor pointed out that - 13 that is associated with later increases in -- in the 14 sentence. Under the government's view, if you committed 15 an offense at a time when it was subject to a 10-year 16 punishment, Congress has reasonably assumed that you are 17 a dangerous person; but that Congress could also 18 reasonably assume that there's a distinction between 19 somebody who commits an offense at a time when it's 20 subject to a 10-year term of imprisonment and someone 21 else who commits that offense at a different time when 22 it's subject to only a 30-month term of imprisonment. 23 And so under North Carolina law, for instance, the - 24 the felony of manufacture of methamphetamine went from 25 being a class H felony which is subject to a 30-year
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 maximum term of imprisonment to being a class C felony 2 -- excuse me, a 30-month maximum term of imprisonment, 3 to a class C felony, which is subject to a 19-year 4 maximum term of imprisonment on December 1st, 2004. And 5 we think it's reasonable for Congress to assume that 6 somebody who committed the crime of manufacturing 7 methamphetamine in North Carolina at a time when it was 8 subject to a 30-month maximum sentence is not as 9 dangerous as somebody who was willing to commit the same 10 offense at a time when it was subject to a 19-year 11 maximum term of imprisonment. 12 And the government's approach by -- by 13 requiring the court to look to the time of the 14 underlying conviction and sentencing unifies the inquiry 15 across both components of the definition of serious drug 16 offense and the definition of violent felony that 17 Justice Kagan alluded to in the earlier part of the 18 argument, that the definition of violent felony includes 19 present-tense references to whether a crime is burglary, 20 the question of whether it is punishable by a -- by a 21 term exceeding 12 months, which is necessary to 22 establish that it's a felony is one that -- that we 23 believe needs to be made at the time of the underlying 24 conviction. 25 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the legislature
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 decreases the penalty because it really has taken a 2 different -- a new look at the nature of the offense and 3 has come to the conclusion that this really is not 4 nearly as serious as we -- as we previously thought? So 5 why should the prior judgment about the severity of the 6 offense be taken into account under ACCA? 7 MR. GANNON: Well, Congress has given us a 8 very objective and simple yardstick to look to and 9 that's just what the maximum term of imprisonment is. 10 And if -- if the State actually thinks that the previous 11 offenses that were committed were less serious, then it 12 could make the decreased maximum term of imprisonment 13 retroactively applicable if -- if it wanted to 14 demonstrate that -- that it really thought that those 15 were mistakes. But that's not the approach that South 16 Carolina has taken -- that North Carolina has taken 17 here. 18 It has said that for crimes that were 19 committed before October 1st, 1994, the prior sentencing 20 regime still applies. And as the Chief Justice pointed 21 out before, the State has not repudiated the judgment 22 that these were serious offenses, not -- not -- not only 23 with respect to when they were committed, but the entire 24 shift to structured sentencing Petitioner 25 acknowledges -

1 JUSTICE ALITO: But what if - 2 MR. GANNON: -- wasn't intended - 3 JUSTICE ALITO: What if they had repudiated 4 their prior normative judgment? And -- and even -- what 5 if they even had made it -- made the new sentence 6 retroactive, but a particular defendant was no longer in 7 prison, so wasn't on parole, so there was nothing - 8 there was no way that this could have any effect on that 9 person? 10 MR. GANNON: Well, it's possible that the 11 State could -- could provide a mechanism by which he 12 could have the documents associated with his prior 13 judgment amended to reflect the fact that he -- he ought 14 not to have been subjected to the -- to the greater term 15 of imprisonment. 16 I think that that's probably the hardest 17 case, somebody who once upon a time actually, like this 18 Petitioner, did a 10-year term of imprisonment for - 19 for the sentence, the State in retrospect concludes that 20 the offense had not been that serious even at the time, 21 and if he had been prosecuted today he -- he should have 22 received only a 5-year maximum term of imprisonment. 23 I think -- I think that that's -- that's an 24 instance where it -- it might be difficult to -- to - 25 to find a way in the statute to say that ACCA doesn't

1 apply to him, that he did not have a previous conviction 2 at the relevant point in time. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure it's so hard. 4 I -- I could find my way clear to saying that if it has 5 been retroactively made a -- a -- a lesser offense, that 6 that would qualify under -- under the statute. I don't 7 know why you insist that his actual conviction be -- be 8 altered. 9 MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think that we 10 would obviously still prevail under an approach like 11 that. It would be an expansion of what we proposed in 12 footnote 5. We think that the relevant inquiry starts 13 with the conviction, but if -- if the court were to ask 14 in the context of the body of law that applies to his 15 offensive conviction, whether the State has changed its 16 mind by doing -- by altering the precise yardstick that 17 Congress has directed the court to look to, then -- then 18 I think that -- that that would be an appropriate way to 19 deal with it. 20 I'm not exactly sure how you get it out of 21 the words of the statute, but it -- it would solve the 22 problem for -- for cases like this of somebody who had 23 been unable to take advantage of a sentence modification 24 type of proceeding. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell us whether

1 changes in State sentences -- do the States routinely 2 address retroactivity? Or do they leave it to their 3 general common law? Or do you have any idea of what - 4 MR. GANNON: Several States have specific 5 saving statutes like the Federal Government does in 6 1 U.S.C. 109. At least three States have constitutional 7 provisions that effectively are something like a saving 8 statute. Sometimes they have background common law 9 principles. 10 In any instance, these types of general 11 provisions, except where the constitutional provisions 12 exist, could be overcome by the State legislature in a 13 particular statute, just as is the case with the Federal 14 savings statute. A State legislature, if it wants to be 15 express about the retroactive applicability of a change, 16 would be able to do that. 17 There may be limitations under the ex post 18 facto clause of its increasing the severity of 19 punishment, but for something like a decrease, there - 20 there would be fewer limitations. 21 If there are no further questions, we would 22 urge the Court to affirm the judgment of the - 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 24 Mr. Gannon. 25 Mr. Gordon, you have 6 minutes remaining.

1 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN C. GORDON 2 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 3 MR. GORDON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 4 First, the government talks about, again, 5 the problems arising if -- if a statute is amended, and 6 so forth. Again, I would like to analogize that to the 7 violent felony prong of ACCA. Predicate convictions 8 disappear. Things that were predicate convictions cease 9 to be when this Court interprets a particular offense as 10 not qualifying as a violent felony, then -- then 11 individuals who had committed that offense it disappears 12 as -- as a predicate. So it is -- it is not anomalous 13 for that to happen. 14 The government speaks about looking to the 15 time of the State proceeding. It is -- that -- that - 16 that approach overlooks that changes to drug laws very 17 well could reflect a normative judgment on the basis of 18 the -- of the legislature, and the question is 19 whether -- whether in the way it wrote the statute, 20 Congress wanted -- wanted to defer to those State 21 judgments. 22 Texas and New York changed their sentencing 23 laws because they judged them to have been too harsh, 24 that -- that they treated as more serious offenses 25 than -- than those offenses actually were.

1 We see that today with the issue of -- of 2 crack cocaine. And under the government's reading, 3 individuals may be hit with -- with an ACCA mandatory 4 minimum on the basis of crack convictions sustained at a 5 time when, you know, the view of crack is very, very 6 different from what it is now. So we think that is an 7 important consideration as well. 8 The question of retroactivity, again, as we 9 have argued in our brief, it does not -- the savings 10 clause in North Carolina was a general savings clause, 11 it applied to every single offense in the -- in the 12 State. It was not a reflection of the -- of the 13 legislature's judgment of seriousness. And if I -- if I 14 may end on a point that I made earlier, the question for 15 this Court really is when do you want to treat two 16 individuals -- when do you -- when do you want to look 17 at them? 18 Do you want to look at them at the time of 19 the Federal offense or do you want to look at them in 20 terms of their prior State convictions and come to a 21 conclusion that although they did exactly the same thing 22 in the State court, one committed a serious drug 23 offense, one did not. We think that is an absurd 24 result. It's not a fair result, and we would ask the 25 Court to reverse the judgment of the Fourth Circuit.
