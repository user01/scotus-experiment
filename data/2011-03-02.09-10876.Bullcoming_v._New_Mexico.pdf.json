  },
  {
    "speaker": "FISHER",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The text, purpose, and history of the Confrontation Clause make it clear that the prosecution cannot introduce one person's testimonial statements through the in-court testimony of someone else. Thus, having held in Melendez-Diaz that a lab analyst's statements in a forensic lab report are testimonial, this is an easy case. The State violated the Confrontation Clause by introducing lab analyst Curtis Caylor's statements in a forensic lab report without putting him on the stand. But a surrogate witness procedure violates all four components of the right to confrontation. It quite obviously violates the defendant's right to have the witness testify in his presence, in the presence of the jury so the jury can observe it, and under oath, as happened in this case."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "FISHER",
    "speech": "Well, the default rule under the Confrontation Clause is in presence, in the courtroom. Now, in Maryland v. Craig, this Court held in a child witness setting -- of course, very different than this case -- that closed-circuit TV would be permissible, and I believe, you know, in a future case, if the State perhaps made some sort of showing that the lab analyst couldn't come to court for some reason, and let's -- let's suppose defendant doesn't stipulate. Is this adequate to meet the Confrontation Clause?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FISHER",
    "speech": "I don't think it would be adequate, Justice Ginsburg, with at least some -- absent at least some showing of unavailability of the witness or -- making the witness unable to come to court.

But the one thing I want to add is that the Public Defender Service brief makes clear, and the facts of this case make clear, it's going to be very rare that a defendant wants to do that. The defendant in this case wanted to stipulate to the nurse's blood draw and unacceptable argument. You're saying the defense has certain rights, and we have to presume there is a defense attorney who's going to afford his client every right the Constitution has.

If a printout comes out of a machine that also says at the top blood sample was Donald Bullcoming's, here's the test that was run, et cetera, those may well be testimonial statements that the analyst triggered the machine to spit out. So the Fourth Circuit has wrestled with this issue in the Washington case, and you can -- you can look at the majority and the dissenting opinions in that case. I think that the question would arise in that scenario, if the graphs were -- if the machine printouts were introduced into evidence, the question would be, are the machine printouts testimonial?

That's the critical objection here. Now, you're right, there's nothing wrong something he doesn't have personal knowledge about, which is whether the procedures were followed in this case. But Mr. -- Mr. Razatos could certainly take the stand and testify to -- to general procedures. But at page 54 and 55 of the Joint Appendix, he -- he simply reads the report's results. And so you have two Confrontation Clause violations, really. You have the report being introduced in the first instance, and then you have -- I believe it's at 54 and 55 of the Joint Appendix. You have the prosecutor asking Mr. Razatos, what was the result? He says the result was .21. As the State itself says at page 58, note 15 of its brief, there was no independent analysis being applied there. All Mr. Razatos was doing was repeating and giving the jury the conclusions that Mr. Caylor had reached."

    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "But if the -- if the machine had expelled a piece of paper that said .21, that piece of paper would not be a -- introduction of that piece of paper, the contents of the piece of paper, would not be think you could debate whether that should -- even that should be considered hearsay of the operator."

    "speaker": "FISHER",
    "speech": "Well -- well, the question that would arise there would be whether the .21 should be treated as Mr. Caylor's statement. Let me -- if I give you two hypotheticals, maybe it explains. On the one hand, I don't think anyone would claim that a time stamp on a fax machine, for example, is a human statement. It's a machine statement, and so therefore it can't be testimonial. On the other hand, if someone types out an affidavit on a word processor and hits print, you can't say, well, that's the machine talking, not the human. So the question arises in the lab context whether a .21 or anything else that comes out of the machine has enough human influence that it ought to be treated as the -- as the person's statement. than .21 by Mr. Caylor's lab report, and that's why these hypotheticals I think are important."

But remember, he was not convicted simply of DUI; he was convicted in New Mexico law of aggravated DUI. And to have aggravated DUI you need to have up to a .16 blood alcohol count. So the report is the only the State could have proved over .16, even if Mr. Bullcoming admitted that he had been drinking that day. So that's why it's important in this case. That's why he wanted to challenge -- that's one reason why he wanted to challenge the report. Let me come back to the -- to the important point, I think, though, that what the State wants to be able to do -- I don't want to ascribe a bad motive, but what the State's rule would allow States to do is to by law enforcement, and prohibited from testifying in many counties because he falsified his reports, his autopsy reports, by writing them with the police report sitting right next to him."

And, in fact, the supervisor when he took the stand at the preliminary hearing told -- told the court the reason why they have me here is the prosecutors find it too hard to have this person in court.

I think Justice Ginsburg raised this point, is that six months after the examination was done, to cross-examine the analyst and ask him, do you remember what the result was six months ago from this one test out of a hundred that he ran, he will not remember without looking at the report. The report is the best evidence in this case to prove the point that is being made here, and -­ do the other thing. Did you do it in this case?

Depending on how the Court rules in this case, it might be that States will be required to do that. But at this point in time under -- under the current jurisprudence, it -- it didn't appear to the State that they needed to retest the sample, and I think you have to worry a little bit about -- about how many people you might indeed have to have come into court and testify if -- if the State -- if the burden on the State is that you have to -- you have to sample twice just in case you're going to lose one of your analysts, I -- I think that that does indeed put a great burden on the State to do that. And so -­"

And so, with regard to ballistics, you know, you would be looking at a little bit different set of facts. But in this case the facts are that -- that the gas chromatograph gave us a printout that said that the -- that the level of alcohol in the blood is .21 grams per 100 milliliters, Mr. Caylor transferred that to a form, and that's what we are putting in. I -- I think that -- that it proves the point that I'm talking about, in a ballistics analysis, you would have to have some analysis and someone to reach a conclusion. And it's that that sets Melendez-Diaz apart from this case, is -- is that there just took a photograph of the bullet and wanted to bring that into the court and say here's what the bullet looks like, the jury then could make a determination whether they think that that bullet appears to be the same as the other. That wouldn't be covered by the Confrontation Clause."

    "speaker": "FISHER",
    "speech": "Thank you. Let me try to make four quick points. First, Justice Alito, I said the first objection was at JA 40, it's actually 44-45 in the Joint Appendix. With regard to the State's argument about whether this document is testimonial, I would simply urge the Court to take a very close look at the lab report itself. It's at JA 62. At the top it says, Mr. Chief Justice, in response to your question, arresting officer identification, and the officer writes, check for blood alcohol concentration. That's the order to the lab. If you look at the bottom in the certification of analyst, he certifies that the following is true and correct, signs his name, and perhaps the most critical thing is at the very bottom, the actual rules of the New Mexico evidence law and criminal procedure law are referenced. So, it's exactly certification is actually different than an oath, that just makes this worse, as in Crawford this Court said that it would be implausible that trial by affidavit would be prohibited but trial by unsworn affidavit would be okay."

  {
    "speaker": "FISHER",
    "speech": "They say much the same thing. There are -- there are several rules referenced at the bottom that all make this automatically admissible, notwithstanding the hearsay rule to prove the truth of the matter asserted. With respect to Justice Ginsburg's question about retesting, you are exactly right. The State had many choices in the case -- in this case about how to proceed. But if it wanted Mr. Razatos to be its witness, all it had to do was have him do a -- retest it and write a new report and have him be the witness. There is no reason it would have to introduce to look at their evidence presumably so -- so far in advance of trial, whatever, and if they had to get a new -- new technician, that would have to put off the trial -­"

    "speaker": "FISHER",
    "speech": "And I think that -- I'm sorry. I think that goes to my last point, which is, Justice Breyer, you're talking about States that do this -- I'll combine my answer to these two things. A continuance would have been perfectly -- perfectly appropriate if that scenario had arisen, Mr. Chief Justice, and that's what -- one thing the public -- Public Defender Service brief it talks about 23 -- 26 jurisdictions encompassing 23 different States that follow the rule that we're advocating today. And it -- we're not asking for more witnesses. It's important that we're -- this isn't a multiple witness problem, we're just asking for a different witness."
