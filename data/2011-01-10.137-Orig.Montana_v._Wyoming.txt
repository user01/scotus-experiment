1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:02 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next this morning in Case 137 on our original docket, 5 Montana v. Wyoming and North Dakota. 6 General Bullock. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE BULLOCK 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF 9 MR. BULLOCK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 The Tongue and Powder Rivers are the only 12 significant water supply in a 10,000-square-mile area in 13 Montana and Wyoming, and this Court is being asked to 14 decide whether the compact allows Wyoming to take the 15 return flows that Montana farmers in that area have 16 always relied on or, instead, affords protection to both 17 States. Our exception should be sustained for three 18 reasons. 19 First, the plain language of the compact 20 preserves the water supply each State was receiving as 21 of 1950. Second, contrary to the compact's purposes, 22 the Master's interpretation would allow individual water 23 users to alter those amounts. And, third, the Master's 24 policy determinations about efficiency add ambiguity to 25 the principles underlying a century of western water

1 law. On that - 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Bullock, would 3 you please point to the precise language of the compact 4 that freezes consumption, as distinguished from the 5 amount of water diverted -- which freezes consumption as 6 of January 1st, 1950? 7 MR. BULLOCK: Yes, Your Honor. In the 8 compact, it's at the appendix of the Master's first 9 interim report. Two areas: first, the preamble 10 provides for an equitable division/apportionment of the 11 water; and then the operative provision, article V(A), 12 states that the uses existing as of January 1st, 1950, 13 in each signatory State shall continue to be enjoyed. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the uses existing 15 is irrigation. 16 I don't see where it says -- and so I can 17 understand, the amount of water diverted can't be 18 increased. 19 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, the whole of 20 article V(A) and V(B) -- I mean, no one contests that 21 it's the full allocation of the water. So V(B) is water 22 after 1950; V(A) is prior. And in order for the status 23 quo to be -- remain -- for the appropriative right to 24 beneficial uses existing in Montana as of 1950, there 25 needs to be a water supply. And also operative to that,

1 it's within the definitions at article II(H), is 2 beneficial use. And that's a derivation or departure 3 from the general prior appropriation law, because it's 4 that use by which a water supply is depleted 5 when usefully used. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But why doesn't the 7 language in article V(A) -- and this is not too helpful 8 -- simply restate the issue before us, what is a 9 beneficial use by the upstream owner? 10 MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, it need not 11 because in article II(H) it defines what a beneficial 12 use is, and that's that use by which the water supply of 13 a basin is depleted. And it's that depletion that -- as 14 of 1950, so it wasn't a full consumption of water in 15 Wyoming, and that depletion is the return flow upon 16 which Montanans rely. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the essence 18 -- that's the essence of the argument before us. The 19 depletion was the amount of water that was taken from 20 this water source to irrigate the crops. The -- the 21 issue now before us is whether beneficial use means 22 consumption or it means use, isn't it? 23 I -- you're begging the question in my mind, 24 because I don't -- what source do you have for the fact 25 that a return flow is beneficial use?

1 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, the return flow is 2 the basis of Montana's water right, so that the return 3 flow under the compact isn't actually beneficial use. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not actually 5 true. Their water right was the beneficial use that 6 your pre-1950 consumers used, meaning you had consumers 7 who were irrigating their own crops, who were doing 8 other things with the water. The rights protected are 9 their pre-1950 uses. You're putting -- you're -- you're 10 still equating consumption as -- as being their use, but 11 I don't know where you get that equation from. 12 MR. BULLOCK: The equation, Your Honor, that 13 consumption is the same thing as - 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As use. 15 MR. BULLOCK: -- as use? 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Uh-huh. 17 MR. BULLOCK: Well, we could go actually to 18 the Special Master, who himself had stated that when 19 exploring -- I mean, the beneficial use reflects the 20 historic consumptive use. It's from his own textbook. 21 It's on page 82. The Master says that a senior's right 22 is limited to the amount he originally beneficially 23 applied and consumptively used; that is, the amount 24 received at the point of use minus the runoff. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could someone pre-1950

1 who irrigated crops change the crops? 2 MR. BULLOCK: It's -- it's an open question, 3 Your Honor. Yes, they certainly could, but not if it 4 impacted a downstream appropriator, as per this compact. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How in the world do any 6 States monitor that? The change in crops, the change in 7 irrigation methods, the change in anything that would 8 cause a difference in return flow? Let's assume global 9 warming in some form or another evaporated more water, 10 and so some crop area did some solar heating that caused 11 a greater evaporation. Is that a breach of the compact? 12 So two questions embedded in there. How 13 does any State monitor that, the change in crops or 14 change in irrigation methods? And, second, how far does 15 it go in terms of the pre-1950s right to use their 16 water? 17 MR. BULLOCK: To the first question, Your 18 Honor, even as of 1950, the drafters recognized that 19 this was a fully appropriated river; it had reached its 20 maximum practical limit. So each individual downstream 21 knows how much water they should be getting. I mean, we 22 have 80 years of measurements on one of these rivers 23 alone, and you could go online right now and find out 24 what the flow is at the State line occurring as of this 25 morning.

1 So a piece of it that this is something 2 we've been doing for a long time in the west as far as 3 knowing what water is in the river, where it is, and 4 throughout, you know, downstream appropriation. 5 To the second question - 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But would - 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But all that shows is - 8 or might show in a particular case, is that the amount 9 of water is reduced. Now the -- then the question is 10 have the senior appropriators or the upstream 11 appropriators reduced it in a way that's inconsistent or 12 that's an overuse of their beneficial rights, and you're 13 right -- again right where we started from. And then 14 you have to regulate exactly how each irrigator is using 15 the appropriative right. 16 MR. BULLOCK: And, Your Honor, you don't - 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the -- so the flows 18 don't necessarily answer the question. 19 MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, it's 20 ultimately up to each State to administer their rights 21 and their water intrastate. But this is a compact among 22 sovereigns. So what we need, what Montana needs, is to 23 get that supply of water that it was receiving as of 24 1950. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you -- this is
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 where it's been talking about beneficial uses. What the 2 compact said -- says is appropriative rights to 3 beneficial uses. And to me that suggests, which I 4 always understood to be the way water law worked in the 5 west, is you have a right to pull out, you know, water, 6 and the appropriative right is you have the right to 7 take out however much you were taking out. And the fact 8 that less comes back, that's something different. That 9 doesn't affect your appropriation. 10 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, even at the time 11 of the compact, that Wyoming recognized their paper 12 rights, that appropriative right was much more than the 13 actual use occurring. So you can't read beneficial use 14 out of -- especially under this compact, but in any. 15 Even under the general common law, you only have an 16 appropriative right for the beneficial use, and all 17 along - 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't that 19 what's going on here? The beneficial use is irrigation 20 of crops. They have an appropriative right to take out 21 so much flow for that. That's all they're doing. 22 They're doing it now, just as they were back then. They 23 just use up more of it once they've taken it out. 24 MR. BULLOCK: Mr. Chief Justice, two things, 25 the first of which, the beneficial use is -- I mean, we
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 can't read this definition of beneficial use out of the 2 contract -- or out of the compact. And it is a 3 contract, actually, among States. And, also, though - 4 second of which, though, that it's also a fundamental 5 tenet of prior appropriation law -- is the downstream 6 irrigator takes, given the same conditions as when he 7 first got his or her right. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Given the same conditions. 9 But is there any evidence, or can you say anything from 10 the record or any other place, going back to 1950 -- I 11 assume in 1950 people knew how much the different 12 landowners were taking out of the stream of the river in 13 Wyoming to use for irrigation and other such purposes. 14 They knew that. 15 Is there any indication they knew at that 16 time how much each individual landowner was putting 17 back? I think the answer is "no." But I'd be very 18 interested if it's "yes." And I think it would help you 19 a lot if it's "yes," because I'm - 20 (Laughter.) 21 JUSTICE BREYER: To tell you the truth, I'm 22 pretty skeptical of the fact that they're writing an 23 appropriation right into this about regulating something 24 they don't even know about. 25 MR. BULLOCK: Effectively, Your Honor, it

1 could be yes. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I didn't say it could 3 be yes. I would like you to tell me if the answer is 4 yes, and then, of course, I'm going to ask you - 5 MR. BULLOCK: Sure. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: -- where in the record I 7 find something that says that they knew how much each 8 individual landowner is putting back into this river in 9 Wyoming. And I think you can't answer that question, 10 can you? 11 MR. BULLOCK: I certainly cannot answer 12 that, and they didn't need to know, from the 13 perspective - 14 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, they didn't? In other 15 words, they didn't know how much is coming back, but 16 you're coming in and saying what they were -- what they 17 were regulating here is they're saying, not only you 18 get -- you maintain a right to take out 100,000 units to 19 do your irrigation, but you have to put back 80,000, but 20 they didn't even know what the number was, whether it 21 was 80, 70, or 60, and the appropriation law is 22 ambiguous? I think -- I think I can go that far with 23 you to say it's ambiguous, but I don't see how I can go 24 further. 25 I mean, that's my basic question. It's -

1 did you see what it was? Was I clear? Not too? 2 MR. BULLOCK: I - 3 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm saying, how can you 4 read this treaty to require landowners to put back 5 amounts into the river that they didn't even know what 6 they were? 7 MR. BULLOCK: First, Your Honor, the 8 individual landowner does not have to put water back in 9 that they didn't even know what they were. What they do 10 need to do is make sure that the beneficial -- the 11 appropriative right to beneficial use is existing in 12 both States. The Solicitor General pointed out that we 13 don't break up V(A) and V(B) and put one group priority 14 over the other, but existing as of 1950 in both States 15 shall continue to be enjoyed. So the only way that we 16 can continue to enjoy the rights in Montana downstream 17 is to ensure that we have the water supplies that we 18 had - 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you say you get the 20 same amount of water and it's up to -- it's up to 21 Wyoming to figure out who they have to cut down for not 22 putting back enough to meet that amount? You don't care 23 what private owner it comes from? It's up to Wyoming to 24 figure out who has to be cut back? 25 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, I don't say we -

BULLOCK: Yes, but -- but, Your Honor, 7 we don't say the exact same quantity of water. We say 8 under like water supplies. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Under like water supplies, 10 yes. 11 MR. BULLOCK: Yes. And - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you tell me the -- I 13 didn't get the page of the Special Master's report which 14 you asserted adopts your -- your definition of 15 beneficial use. What page was it? 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought you referred us, 17 just while you're going through your notes, to page 82, 18 and there's an intriguing footnote where the Special 19 Master talks about his own -- his own book. But that 20 doesn't seem to me to be conclusive on your point, 21 because he's saying the area is confused. And his point 22 -- it seems to me it brings up what the special -- I'm 23 taking over your answer to Justice Scalia's question. 24 It is page 82, footnote - 25 MR. BULLOCK: Footnote 15, yes, Your Honor.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There's a footnote on that 2 page, yes. 3 MR. BULLOCK: And there he's talking 4 about - 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to say what you 6 say it says. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: If your understanding is 8 correct, would the result be that landowners in Wyoming 9 would only be allowed to consume as much as they 10 consumed in 1950, but landowners in Montana could take 11 advantage of improved irrigation techniques and use much 12 more of the -- they could divert the same amount of 13 water, but they could use much more of it? 14 MR. BULLOCK: No, Your Honor, that would not 15 be the case. 16 JUSTICE ALITO: Why wouldn't it? 17 MR. BULLOCK: First, for the irrigators in 18 Montana -- I mean, one of the things -- Montana sought 19 to have a system of interstate administration. Montana 20 -- or Wyoming, through storage, through curtailing 21 consumption by post-'50 users, or otherwise can 22 administer its water rights in however it so deems. So, 23 ultimately, that's a decision of the State of how it 24 administers the water rights and the consumption of that 25 amount that it has.
14

1 For Montana, we can't increase consumption 2 any more than the water that we would have received at 3 that point. So to the extent that Montana allows an 4 individual irrigator to go to 100 percent of consumption 5 of its water right, then in our system in Montana, we 6 have to deal with what's going to happen to the 7 subsequent appropriator right downstream. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what happens under 9 Montana law? 10 MR. BULLOCK: Under Montana law, if there's 11 an injury, and that's -- that's actually -- and the 12 Special Master pointed this out in another one of his 13 footnotes, that that still would be actionable. Like a 14 change from flood irrigation to sprinkler irrigation, to 15 the extent that it deprives a downstream user of waters 16 that they're relying on, that they could bring an 17 action. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but your people can do 19 that. Your people can get more use out of the same 20 amount of water diverted by going to sprinkler 21 irrigation, whereas the people in Wyoming can't. That's 22 a little unfair, it seems to me. Right? 23 MR. BULLOCK: Both can, Your Honor. I mean, 24 that -- that is -- I guess the presumption is that we 25 would have the water to use it, and Wyoming is actually
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 getting a lot more production by consuming a lot more of 2 the water within its right. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Your people are entitled to 4 take out the same amount they took out before, right? 5 Pre-1950? 6 MR. BULLOCK: Under like water supply 7 conditions - 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Whereas the people in 9 Wyoming, you say, are not entitled to take out the same 10 amount; they are entitled only net the same amount that 11 they had before. Whereas downstream your people can 12 take out the same amount and whereas before 20 percent 13 of it used to go back into the stream, they can now make 14 use of that whole 20 percent through sprinkler 15 irrigation, right? It gives you a great advantage. 16 I mean, maybe that's the way it was written, 17 but -- but don't tell me that this is even-handed, 18 because it - 19 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, I don't think that 20 it does give us a great advantage, because we still have 21 to deal with the same amount of water supply that we 22 would have had. So, at that point, if we switch to 23 sprinkler irrigation, the first irrigator does that, 24 there's going to be a shortage down river unless we make 25 it up through additional storage or other causes. So -

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have ultimate 2 liability to Montana -- pardon me -- to North Dakota for 3 -- for overuse? 4 MR. BULLOCK: We do a little bit, Your 5 Honor. There's the picture of the basin in the first 6 appendix. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I won't -- I won't 8 get into that, but it does seem to me that the Chief 9 Justice asked the question, if you're entitled to take 10 the water, you can use it for any purpose. I -- I take 11 it the answer to that is it has to be a beneficial use, 12 it has to be for approximately the same crop, but that 13 brings us to this -- to this gray area that the Special 14 Master refers to on page 82 as confusing. And I 15 think -- was it page 65 -- he talks about this is a 16 confusing area of the law. 17 What is your best authority for your 18 position? What is the best authority? Do you have a 19 case or a -- a paragraph in a treatise that's - 20 MR. BULLOCK: Sure. Yes, Your Honor. In 21 1992, the Utah Supreme Court framed the question: This 22 court's called upon to determine the applicable law when 23 the use of new technology impacts - 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Utah case is your best 25 case?
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. BULLOCK: That's -- that's the only case 2 that any of the parties cited that actually deals with 3 the change from sprinkler -- or flood to sprinkler 4 irrigation. And what that said is if the return flow 5 goes to the same river which it came from, that 6 subsequent irrigators or downstream appropriators have 7 the right to rely on that. 8 And I guess I'd say that my second best case 9 is the Special Master's own footnote. It's 69/12, where 10 he says that, you know, even though State change 11 procedures don't typically apply to crop or -- changes 12 in crop irrigation techniques, this does not mean 13 there's no way to challenge increases in efficiency. 14 Downstream water users, for example, could sue to enjoin 15 an upstream appropriator from increasing consumption or 16 to force the upstream appropriator to replace lost 17 runoff. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would think your best 19 point is not all of that stuff, but simply the 20 definition section, which very clearly makes a 21 distinction between beneficial use and diversion. And 22 your point is that what is guaranteed is not the 23 diversion right that existed pre-1950, but the 24 beneficial use right, which is the net use of the water, 25 not -- not the total amount diverted.

1 If -- if there were not both of those 2 definitions, it seems to me it would be a little -- your 3 case would be a little harder. But with the two of 4 those definitions there and with V(A) using beneficial 5 use rather than -- it could have said diversion, 6 appropriative right to diversion, but it didn't say 7 that. It said to beneficial use. 8 Well, why -- why define beneficial use that 9 way if you don't mean it? That's your best point, isn't 10 it? 11 MR. BULLOCK: I -- I agree, Your Honor. 12 (Laughter.) 13 MR. BULLOCK: I was trying to -- I believe 14 Justice Kennedy asked for a case or a treatise, so 15 that's - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, all right. 17 MR. BULLOCK: But I agree that the plain 18 language -- and especially in an area where there's so 19 much ambiguities the Special Master acknowledges, why 20 change the status quo of what was occurring? And 21 that's - 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand 23 why that's a good -- good answer. I mean, the 24 beneficial use is that use by which the water supply is 25 depleted. Well, the use here is irrigation. It doesn't
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 say irrigation up to the technological development in 2 1950. They're still taking out the same amount of water 3 for that beneficial use. They're using it to irrigate. 4 And if they get better at it so they use more, well, 5 that's just too bad for you. 6 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, but they're 7 depleting more from the basin, and that's -- I mean, you 8 can have beneficial use for non-consumptive purposes. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: That's back where -- that's 10 where I was here, too. See, I can't get too far -- I 11 mean, you have the word "depletion" in that definition. 12 I -- I -- that might help you. But I'm thinking in 13 accordance with the doctrine of appropriation, what does 14 that doctrine, that legal doctrine, say about use and 15 return? And that's why we're -- we're -- why I was 16 thinking it seems totally unclear. 17 It talks about seepage, the cases, which I 18 gather is different from return. Okay. So could they 19 have really meant net? And what struck me is that they 20 couldn't, which -- which you were beginning to address, 21 too, is that they couldn't have meant net because the 22 water law at that time is unlikely to have meant net for 23 the reason that they didn't -- you don't know what's 24 coming back. 25 Do you see? It's not just -- I see your
20
Alderson Reporting Company

1 point. Your point is, well, Wyoming knew how much was 2 going into Wyoming. But that's not my point. My point 3 is what -- what's the water law? What's the law of 4 appropriation at that time in respect to return flows? 5 And if people didn't measure return flows in general, I 6 suspect in an ambiguous area they would have analogized 7 it to seepage, which is what the -- what the Special 8 Master thought. 9 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, the seepage cases, 10 though, deal with adjoining landowners - 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, they - 12 MR. BULLOCK: -- not the same river flow, 13 and the Special Master acknowledged that. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh. 15 MR. BULLOCK: That -- and I guess what I was 16 earlier trying to explain is certainly each appropriator 17 knows how much water it would -- would be receiving, 18 what the flows typically are, and they all basically 19 judge on that. But I guess if there's any ambiguity - 20 and the law wasn't necessarily clear as of 1950 on 21 conversions from flood to sprinkler irrigation, but what 22 we were trying to do is preserve those uses in both 23 States existing as of January 1st, 1950, and we can't do 24 that without a water supply. 25 Other than the text, I think that the next
21

1 place that one would look in interpreting the compact 2 would be the legislative history. And I think that the 3 report to the Senate was real good in saying that - 4 and this is part of -- it's appended to motion -5 Montana's brief in response to the motion to dismiss the 6 bill of complaint. At 3a it says, "It's clear then that 7 the demand of one State upon another for a supply 8 different from that now obtaining under present 9 conditions of supply and diversion is not contemplated, 10 nor would such a demand have a legal standing." 11 So what they were trying to do in 1950 is 12 protect what each State was doing. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that again - 14 where at? 15 MR. BULLOCK: That's at 3a of the appendix, 16 Montana's motion -- or the response to Wyoming's motion 17 to dismiss the bill of complaint. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Bullock, assume 19 that you're right, that what was guaranteed was the same 20 amount of water flowing into Montana as in 1950, and 21 I -- I take it you don't care how Wyoming deals with 22 this, but what -- if you're right, what could Wyoming 23 do? It can't tell the -- the farmers go back to the old 24 way of irrigating or go back to a different crop? 25 MR. BULLOCK: No -- I mean, no, Justice

1 Ginsburg. Wyoming could choose to reduce groundwater 2 pumping. They could choose to curtail irrigation on 3 post-1950. They could choose to release storage. I 4 mean, they've -- they've built, I think, 15 new 5 reservoirs in Wyoming since the date of the compact. 6 They could choose to release water from that to fulfill 7 those rights. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you say it doesn't - 9 they don't -- Wyoming doesn't have to know whether 10 farmer A or farmer B is taking more than they took in 11 1950 -- I mean, is using more than they used in 1950; 12 they just have to know what the total amount is, and 13 Wyoming can make that up? 14 MR. BULLOCK: Yes, Your Honor. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So really -- I'm sorry. 16 The issue is, are both of you -- both of you have pre 17 and post-1950 users? 18 MR. BULLOCK: Yes, Your Honor. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And I -- I 20 guess this goes to the second question, which was sort 21 of not really addressed. The Special Master said, well, 22 you could cut back your post-1950 users and satisfy all 23 of the needs of your pre-1950 users. Why isn't that the 24 answer? Why isn't that an answer that should be 25 respected, because you can satisfy all of the pre-1950
23

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 needs that you have potentially? 2 MR. BULLOCK: No, Your Honor, we can't 3 necessarily satisfy all the needs. The drafters did say 4 even as of 1950 that this basin reached its maximum 5 practicable limit for irrigation, and that's from the 6 October -- the last of the drafters meetings. So -- so, 7 the water supply as of then, without additional storage, 8 had already hit that limit. And, ultimately, what we 9 need, though, is -- each State will administer 10 intrastate, but we still should be able to rely on the 11 ability to get a supply of water to meet those needs as 12 of 1950 under like water supply conditions. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Before any 1950 use? 14 Post-1950 users are permitted? 15 MR. BULLOCK: We're still at the stage of 16 discovery, but, yes, likely that's how it would occur, 17 Your Honor. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why isn't this a 19 premature lawsuit? Because I think really the essence 20 of your claim is we need the pre-1950 water flow. We 21 don't care who it comes from. And what -- all the 22 Special Master said, in my mind, was the difference - 23 you can't look to what the pre-1950s were doing in this 24 situation, but I haven't addressed what the posts are 25 going to do or have been doing and whether that's right,

1 and that's depriving you of the water flow. 2 I don't know if he answered that question. 3 Are you, in fact, entitled to a minimum amount of water 4 flow? That's really what should be the point of the 5 issue, isn't it? 6 MR. BULLOCK: It is, or that quantity under 7 like water supply conditions. I don't think it's 8 premature. We've tried to administer this compact, 9 actually made calls in 2004 and 2006; and as a result of 10 not getting the water, knowing -- believing we're in a 11 water-short time, that's when we filed this action. 12 I'd like to reserve my time if I may. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 14 Mr. Michael. 15 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER KENNETH MICHAEL 16 ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANT WYOMING 17 MR. MICHAEL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 18 please the Court: 19 The Court has identified in previous 20 questioning this case at this point in this issue 21 involves whether a Wyoming or a Montana diverter may 22 change cropping patterns, may change various 23 technologies in irrigated agriculture, and change up and 24 down, depending on the year and the fallowing of land 25 and that sort of thing, the amount of water that is
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 actually consumed by crops. And I think the Court has 2 identified the critical fact that a water right, a 3 classic western water right, appropriative right as in 4 article V(A), is made up of the right to divert an 5 amount of water at a head gate in an irrigation 6 situation, put it on a defined quantity of land, and use 7 it for a purpose, irrigation, that's defined by the 8 State. Wyoming has had such a -- a system in place for 9 many years and controls those issues but does not and 10 has not attempted to measure consumptive. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what is the 12 controlling principle in answering the question that I 13 think you properly put? Could these irrigators switch 14 to something like rice, which absorbs a tremendous 15 amount of water, or are they -- when they switch crops 16 it must be reasonably close to the earlier beneficial 17 use? What is -- what is the standard that we look to, 18 to answer that question? 19 MR. MICHAEL: The standard is the standard 20 of waste, practical irrigation. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The standard of? 22 MR. MICHAEL: Waste, of not wasting water, 23 practical irrigation. The irrigation right is a general 24 right, and if rice were to double the amount of 25 consumptive use by the crop, that would be permissible
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 if the previous use had not been affected by an 2 abandonment action, because the amount of water was 3 being reasonably used for the former crop and the crop 4 has changed. So it's not a question of -- of percentage 5 change. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought - 7 MR. MICHAEL: It's a question - 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the first - 9 suppose the first crop absorbs 50 percent of the water 10 and returns 50 percent by seepage. The second crop that 11 they switch to still absorbs just 50 percent of the 12 water but because of the -- of the pattern, the other 50 13 percent just evaporates? 14 MR. MICHAEL: The -- the way that the water 15 is -- there's -- there's a basket, Your Honor. There's 16 a basket that starts with a quantity that's taken at the 17 head gate, 4 cubic feet per second put on the -- on the 18 field. And within that quantity there -- there's 19 multiple -- two components, basically: the amount 20 consumed by the crop -- I should say the amount consumed 21 by the crop or depleted by other elements, ditches, 22 seepage, other types of things, deep percolation into 23 the ground -- and -- and the other component which is 24 water that's not lost but can return or go somewhere. 25 It's not evaporated; there's no transpiration. So
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 there's those two components. 2 And if that -- if that quantity, that 3 division changes, that's perfectly permissible within 4 the use of the water right. And the reason for that was 5 set out in Wiel's -- Samuel Wiel's text in 1911, carried 6 forward in texts and cases ever since, that -- and in 7 the Binning case, a 1940 case in Wyoming; which is the 8 water while it's in the stream in the public common is 9 -- is not under the possession and control -- the 10 personal property control of the irrigator. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: But we're dealing here with 12 a compact which has a text, and -- and what the water 13 law of Wyoming or of Montana happened to be cannot 14 overrule the text, and I am -- I'm hung up on the fact 15 that article V(A) says appropriative rights to the 16 beneficial uses of the water of the Yellowstone River 17 System existing as of January 1, 1950. Appropriative 18 rights not to diversion, not to diversion for beneficial 19 uses, but appropriative rights to the beneficial uses, 20 which is defined -- which is defined in the compact to 21 say "that use by which the water supply of a drainage 22 basin is depleted when usefully employed." 23 And it could have said diversion, but it 24 didn't say that, and I notice that the Government's 25 brief uses -- seems to use the words interchangeably,
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 "depletion" and "diversion." They're not 2 interchangeable. They're defined quite separately in 3 this thing. And besides which I find it implausible 4 that Montana signed on to, well, we don't know how much 5 water we're going to get; it depends, you know, upon how 6 much stuff was -- was flowing back before, but we're not 7 guaranteed that that will be flowing back again. 8 You combine those two things, and I -- I - 9 what do you do about that definition? 10 MR. MICHAEL: Your Honor, the definition has 11 two components, the classic beneficial -- the component 12 that would come from a classic beneficial use 13 definition, which is useful employment for the 14 activities of man, a beneficial purpose, which -- a non 15 wasteful purpose. That's the start. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not how it's 17 defined. 18 MR. MICHAEL: That's -- that's the last 19 portion. That's the second part. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's fine. 21 MR. MICHAEL: The first part is use by which 22 the water supply of a drainage basin is depleted. In 23 the western United States, a drainage basin - 24 appropriable water is not all the water in the air and 25 on the land and dropping from the sky; appropriable
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 water is water confined in a water course. The Binning 2 case made that clear. Until the water returned from the 3 field into a water course, it was not appropriable by 4 the downstream user. So this definition -- by using 5 the - 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But are you addressing the 7 word "depleted"? 8 MR. MICHAEL: I'm addressing the word 9 "supply" of the drainage basin; and then it is depleted. 10 Use by which the supply, the water supply of a drainage 11 basin, is depleted. 12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But are you saying that 13 "depleted" means only what's withdrawn, and it's not 14 calculated by -- with reference to what is returned? 15 MR. MICHAEL: That's correct. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: But you -- obviously, 17 you're saying - 18 MR. MICHAEL: That is different from 19 "diverted." 20 JUSTICE BREYER: You read it with a 21 different emphasis. Justice Scalia read it with - 22 beneficial use is that use by which the water supply of 23 a drainage basin "is depleted" when usefully employed by 24 the activities of man. 25 And you read it: By which the water supply
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of a drainage basin is depleted "when usefully employed 2 by the activities of man." So that it is a definition 3 in respect to how you use it, not amounts. 4 But if you emphasize the word "depleted," it 5 could be read as referring to amounts, and not quality 6 of use, not nature. And - 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't you emphasize 8 both of them? 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, well - 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm willing to emphasize 11 both, but you can't write out the "depleted" out of the 12 -- how does your definition of "depleted" differ from - 13 from "diversion"? 14 MR. MICHAEL: If you had a broader - 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is the diversion for a 16 beneficial use the same thing as a depletion? 17 MR. MICHAEL: May I give an example? 18 In a -- in a river, the Tongue River, if 19 there is a -- if there is a waterwheel, Montana allows 20 water rights. A 1912 case, Hennessy v. Featherman, 21 allows a water right to push a waterwheel. That water 22 flowing down the river does not -- does not -- is not 23 diverted. And nevertheless it -- it would allow a water 24 right. 25 This definition differentiates that. In
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 this definition under the compact, water that is 2 diverted for agriculture, that is diverted is a 3 beneficial use, but there's a small segment of -- of 4 what could be a legitimate water right that is excluded 5 under this definition. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but, I mean, to -- to 7 do that, the definition would have read: The term 8 "beneficial use" is defined to be that use by which the 9 water -- that use "for which" the water supply of a 10 drainage basin is diverted for useful employment by the 11 activities of man, and that's not what it says. To the 12 contrary, it makes a clear distinction between 13 "depletion" and the previous definition of "diversion." 14 I just -- I was trying to give that stark 15 difference some effect in the later section V(A). 16 MR. MICHAEL: Let me say this, Your Honor, 17 if I might: The -- you will find in -- in the compact, 18 in article V(B), the use of both "diversion" and 19 "beneficial use." 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 21 MR. MICHAEL: And so we have two -- those 22 terms are both used. And in V(B) the drafters made a 23 distinction; they said direct diversions or storage 24 would be covered by V(B), and then they said how 25 diversions are counted.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where - 2 MR. MICHAEL: In (C) they talk about the - 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: What part of V(B) are you 4 talking about? 5 MR. MICHAEL: I'm talking about at the 6 bottom of V(B), where you're talking about the three - 7 the third-tier rights. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: The point of measurement 9 shall be below the last diversion? 10 MR. MICHAEL: No, V(B). In the first text, 11 the first paragraph of V(B), towards the bottom, the 12 text says: "And the remainder of the unused and 13 unappropriated water is allocated to each State for 14 storage and direct diversions for beneficial use on new 15 lands." 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me - 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: For -- exactly. I mean, 18 there it talks about diversions for beneficial use and 19 not depletion for beneficial use. I mean, I think 20 that's something different. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could I - 22 MR. MICHAEL: Your Honor. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you answer -- do 24 you see a difference? Finish that, and then could I 25 just clarify something from what you were just reading?

1 MR. MICHAEL: I think there's a difference 2 in that the -- in practical terms, the depletion -- in 3 the depletion and the beneficial use definition, a 4 diversion would be the only way to deplete that. And 5 that's -- that's the point. The only way to make it 6 through a depletion - 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so, once again, you're 8 saying that depletion is a calculation of what is taken 9 without reference to what returns? 10 MR. MICHAEL: Yes, Your Honor. And - 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, so when - 12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And your best authority 13 for that is? 14 MR. MICHAEL: The best authority, I think, 15 is what the -- the Special Master's discussion of this, 16 that the only practical way a water supply of the 17 drainage basin would -- being the quantities of water in 18 the rivers themselves, would be depleted would be 19 through a diversion. So there's really no reason to 20 make a distinction. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to follow up on 22 Justice Kennedy's point, because I think it's important: 23 So you were reading -- when it says "is depleted," you 24 think all you have to show is that it's less than when 25 you started, and once that is shown, it is depleted.

1 Then you're saying, but we can deplete as much as we 2 want? 3 MR. MICHAEL: Yes, depletion would be moving 4 it from this glass of water, if that was the river - 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 6 MR. MICHAEL: -- and it reduces the quantity 7 of water in the river. That would be a depletion. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you don't care 9 how much? You're saying, well, this is a beneficial use 10 because it depletes some of the water, it takes some 11 away, and once we have gotten over that hurdle, all bets 12 are off and we can deplete as much as we want. 13 MR. MICHAEL: Yes. And, of course, the 14 water right - 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess to get 16 back to the point, wouldn't the normal word be "divert"? 17 MR. MICHAEL: It may well be, Your Honor. 18 There's -- there's some problems with this definition. 19 It self-defines itself using "usefully" twice, so we 20 have some drafting issues with -- with this -- in some 21 of these. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could I go back 23 to my question, which is twofold? The first is the 24 Solicitor General recommends that we defer the decision 25 on remedies in this case, and Montana seems to agree.
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Do you agree as well? The second question presented. 2 MR. MICHAEL: That has been deferred, is my 3 understanding. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It has? My problem with 5 this is -- and I think I need to understand what the 6 fight is about here, or what the dispute is about -- it 7 really does seem to me that it is a question of 8 remedies, not about whether you're taking more water 9 rights through irrigation or not. 10 If I understand this compact right, both of 11 you are protected in your pre-1950 beneficial uses. 12 Each of you appear, under the terms of article V, to be 13 entitled to get enough water to fill those uses. The 14 next section, the one that you read earlier, lets you 15 use things in the future for post-1950 uses, but only if 16 the water supply's protected pre-1950 beneficial uses 17 have received all they're entitled to. Neither of you 18 are entitled or -- to take anything post-1950 until 19 pre-1950 is protected. 20 That's how I read article V. Am I reading 21 it wrong? Because it seems to me that the only time 22 that we get into a dispute -- and this is the part that 23 I think your adversary may be right about, ultimately - 24 is it's not a consumptive compact, but it's a use 25 compact, and both of you are entitled to get a full -
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that's what I'm reading article V to say, to get enough 2 water to satisfy the beneficial uses before anybody's 3 entitled to post-1950 water. 4 Tell me what in the language of article V 5 suggests something different than that understanding. 6 MR. MICHAEL: I disagree -- the language in 7 article V that disagrees with that is the very first few 8 words, "appropriative rights." Appropriative rights do 9 not guarantee that any water user or any group of water 10 users will be satisfied. 1934 was a horrendously dry 11 year in the basin, 50 percent -- flows were 50 percent 12 less than normal. In those kinds of years, the river - 13 the river dried up that year in parts of the river, 14 so -- well - 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this is not 16 happening today, is it? There's - 17 MR. MICHAEL: Oh, yes. It happened in 2004. 18 It - 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right, but that's an 20 isolated year. 21 MR. MICHAEL: Yes. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In most years, are you 23 putting water to post-1950 use -- to post-1950 uses or 24 not? Have you been regularly putting water to post-1950 25 uses?
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. MICHAEL: Both States, at times. Yes, 2 last year, all post-1950 uses got satisfied. It varies 3 widely. But the point is that only the appropriative 4 right, which is not a guarantee of a quantity of 5 water -- so the first clause of the compact, article 6 V(A), does not establish a quantity of water, and there 7 are many compacts that do this. They establish a 8 quantity of water, and they do it - 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't disagree. 10 MR. MICHAEL: -- quite simply. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't disagree, but as 12 I read the article, it says, you put all the water 13 that's available to pre-1950 appropriated uses. You 14 then go, as I read the second part of this article, to 15 any water supplies that each State has until you fulfill 16 those 1950 appropriated uses. And then it apportions, 17 between the two of you, post-1950 percentages of the 18 excess water that you're entitled to have. 19 Am I correct about that structure? 20 MR. MICHAEL: Yes, and on an ongoing basis. 21 It's not a quantity. None of this is done in quantity. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly. 23 MR. MICHAEL: It's all done in a system 24 that's dynamic. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's why -- I do

1 understand the remedies were deferred, but to the extent 2 that we were to rule that appropriated rights included 3 the right to change irrigation methods or crops -- we 4 don't have to reach crops, because that's not at issue 5 here -- in the end, you're only entitled to take the 6 appropriated uses, including irrigation rights, that 7 existed pre-1950. Are they entitled to get as much 8 water as necessary to satisfy their pre-1950 rights or 9 not - 10 MR. MICHAEL: No. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- before you can use 12 post-1950 water? 13 MR. MICHAEL: Yes. Yes, before -- on these 14 -- on those particular dates. On those particular 15 dates, if there are pre-1950 rights in Montana that are 16 not satisfied on that river and there's post-1950 rights 17 in Wyoming, the Special Master has ruled, contrary to 18 Wyoming's argument - 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But how -- why aren't 20 you taking more of the percentage that way of post-1950 21 waters? The compact says, post-1950, you can take 22 whatever percentage it was. I've forgotten what 23 percentage that might have been. 24 MR. MICHAEL: 60 percent. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Whatever it was. 60

1 percent - 2 MR. MICHAEL: This might add on that. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They're entitled to 40. 4 Does that mean you can take a hundred percent, because 5 there happens to be more water that they can satisfy the 6 pre-1950s users with? Why aren't they entitled to their 7 40 percent of whatever that big basin is so they can 8 give more water to post-1950 users, that they can 9 exploit their full 40 percent? 10 MR. MICHAEL: Your Honor, I'm not following, 11 because there's a distinction between each class of 12 water. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes, I understand that. 14 MR. MICHAEL: And in your -- in your 15 question, I'm not following which class you are 16 referring to. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I -- I'm answering 18 this only -- I'm asking this because I know we've 19 deferred decision on the remedies - 20 MR. MICHAEL: Yes. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but for me that is so 22 integral to the issue here because when they talk about 23 being entitled to a water flow, I see that as being 24 entitled to a pre-1950 satisfaction of water needs or 25 beneficial uses before anybody gets post-1950 water.

1 And so, I see the only issue before us, 2 because remedies have been put aside, as to whether the 3 beneficial use includes some percentage increase because 4 of irrigation demands, but so what? It just means it's 5 going to limit post-1950 users. It's not going to limit 6 the rights of the pre-1950 users. 7 Everybody's entitled to change their 8 irrigation methods. Everybody's entitled to change 9 their crops. They appear not to be entitled to put the 10 water to a new use, whatever -- however that's defined. 11 We don't need to get there today, but I'm not sure how 12 you're entitled to post-1950 uses while they're still 13 not satisfied in 1950 use. 14 MR. MICHAEL: We -- Wyoming is not entitled 15 on the same river to take post-1950 water when there is 16 a pre-1950 use in Montana that's not satisfied. The 17 Special Master has held that. Pre-1950s are - 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The question is what? 19 MR. MICHAEL: He has -- the Special -- I'm 20 sorry.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 recommitted to the Special Master. So for that -- for 2 that reason the parties have addressed only the first 3 exception in this argument today. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- but your 5 brief, before we entered that order, said the Special 6 Master was right, that they have to satisfy their needs 7 from pre -- post-1950 users. Why? Aren't they entitled 8 to their 40 percent of how much excess water there may 9 be after their pre-1950 users have been satisfied in 10 full? Doesn't this compact say both of their pre-1950 11 users have to be satisfied first? 12 MR. JAY: Both of their pre-1950 users have 13 to be satisfied first, yes, we agree with that, so that 14 no one in Wyoming is supposed to be taking post-1950 15 water until pre-1950 users in Montana are satisfied. We 16 agree with that. 17 The -- the point on which -- that the Court 18 has sent back to the Special Master is what happens if 19 pre-1950 users in Montana are not satisfied but they 20 could be because Montana post-1950 users in Montana are 21 also diverting water. But what we think the -- the 22 question squarely before the Court here is whether the 23 right to recapture water gained from increased 24 efficiency is part of the pre-1950 appropriative right, 25 and that matters when there's not enough water in the

In the east, 10 you try to allocate everything fairly so everyone is 11 treated fairly, and I thought in the west, for reasons 12 of efficiency, it's first come, first served. 13 MR. JAY: And here the States decided not to 14 do that on an interstate basis. They said that -- that 15 all pre-1950 users would be on the same footing as 16 between the States. So that Montana cannot complain 17 if -- as long as Wyoming's water users pre-1950 are not 18 exceeding their pre-1950 right, Montana has no remedy 19 and there's no breach. They concede that on page 20 of 20 their surreply. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Jay, I thought that 22 the Special Master -- very important to him was the 23 meaning of "appropriative rights," and he said that the 24 Wyoming law is just as you've described, that is, the 25 farmer can use all that water; and he said Montana law

1 is uncertain, but Wyoming law is not out of line with 2 the general approach. 3 Suppose this had been a case -- suppose 4 Montana law, instead of being uncertain, was 5 diametrically opposite Wyoming law, then what happens 6 under this compact? 7 MR. JAY: Under this compact, Justice 8 Ginsburg, the appropriative rights existing in each 9 signatory State as of January 1st, 1950, are what are 10 preserved and carried forward by article V(A). Each 11 water user in -- in each State has exactly the same 12 rights that he had on January 1st, 1950. Now, in 13 Montana perhaps that might not include the right to 14 recapture efficiencies, but we know, for example, that 15 -- that a Montana water user could divert more water per 16 acre because Montana had a more generous concept of 17 beneficial use for irrigation per acre than Wyoming did. 18 The compact simply carries forward all 19 existing appropriative rights, and the drafters 20 consciously rejected the idea that they should come up 21 with some kind of interstate administration system 22 putting the two States' rights on an equal footing. 23 They carried forward each element in the bundle of 24 sticks that a rights holder had on January 1st, 1950, 25 subject to the single override of the definition of
46

1 "beneficial use." And I'd like to turn to that because 2 Justice Scalia's colloquy with Mr. Michael brought that 3 out. 4 In article II(H), there is a definition of 5 "beneficial use." What the compact's definition of 6 "beneficial use" does is specify that non-depletive uses 7 don't count. Hydropower is a classic example. 8 Hydropower in the main channel is something that one 9 could get an appropriative right for under some western 10 water law. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you -- and this is 12 II - 13 MR. JAY: II(H), which is on page A-4 to the 14 appendix of the Special Master's report. That's the 15 definition of "beneficial use." 16 What it does not do is specify that 17 depletion is the measure of beneficial use. It says 18 beneficial use is not the use to the extent that the 19 water supply is depleted; it's the use -- it's a use by 20 which the water supply is depleted. Because irrigation 21 means water goes out and doesn't come -- and some of it 22 doesn't come back, irrigation is a depletive use. It's 23 recognized by the compact. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, hydropower would - 25 would not constitute a diversion.

1 MR. JAY: But a mill race would, Justice 2 Scalia. A mill race takes water out of the river, and 3 you turn -- you turn the wheel of your grist mill with 4 it, but then -- and then the water comes back to the 5 river. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that -- that's a 7 diversion. 8 MR. JAY: Yes, that's a diversion, but not a 9 depletion. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: It means the taking or 11 removing of water when the water so taken or removed is 12 not returned directly into the channel of the 13 Yellowstone River. So if you have a mill race, the 14 water comes through the mill race, goes right back; it's 15 -- it's not even a diversion. You don't have to qualify 16 as a beneficial use. 17 MR. JAY: But the -- the point, Justice 18 Scalia, article V(A) doesn't use diversion, and that - 19 that's precisely the point. It doesn't use "diversion"; 20 it uses -- it uses "beneficial use." And any -- any - 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't it use 22 "diversion" if it means what you say? 23 MR. JAY: Because they -- it didn't use 24 "diversion" because it wasn't quantifying them. Whereas 25 -- what -- "diversion" is used in article V(B) because
48

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the diversion is the - 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course it's quantified. 3 I mean, the whole purpose is you can't take any more 4 than you were taking before. It has to be quantified 5 somehow. 6 MR. JAY: It's not quantified in the 7 sense -- as Justice Breyer pointed out, no one -- they 8 didn't write down, especially in Montana, because as the 9 Special Master said on page 22, Montana didn't have a 10 centralized system of rights; they didn't know exactly 11 how much was being diverted in Montana. They certainly 12 didn't know how much was being consumed or how much was 13 being returned to the river. 14 At Joint Appendix 585, there's a Federal 15 Power Commission report that says that it is almost 16 impossible to make an accurate determination of return 17 flow. So what -- what the drafters did was they -- for 18 the pre-1950 rights, they said we're not going to cap - 19 quantify them at all; we're going to grandfather them 20 in, freeze them in place. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: So your linguistic argument 22 is they didn't use the word "diversion" because they 23 didn't want to throw the mill race example into the 24 definition - 25 MR. JAY: My argument, Justice -
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE BREYER -- is that right? 2 MR. JAY: My argument, Justice Breyer, is 3 that they didn't want mill races or hydropower to count. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, they didn't want mill 5 races in the definition, so they purposely didn't use 6 the word "diversion"; that's why they used the word 7 "depletion." 8 MR. JAY: That's -- they used the word 9 "depletion," but they didn't make the amount of 10 depletion, the measurement of - 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: A mill race is not - 12 MR. JAY: That is the point. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: A mill race is not a 14 diversion. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Correct, and they wanted 16 that. 17 MR. JAY: A mill race is a diversion under 18 the common understanding of that term, Justice Scalia. 19 It may - 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not under the definition. 21 MR. JAY: Not under the special definition 22 used for article V(B), but - 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You keep saying 24 everybody gets the same beneficial use they had prior to 25 1950, but -- even though that may mean they can't do it.

1 In other words, they may have a right to get 50 cubic 2 whatever for irrigation, but there may not be any water 3 there for them to use it because of the increased 4 efficiencies upstream. 5 MR. JAY: That -- that is true, Mr. Chief 6 Justice, but that has always been the case under western 7 water law that the appropriative right is a priority, 8 that when it's your turn and there's enough water, you 9 get to take the amount of water to which you have a 10 right. But it was clear in Wyoming on January 1st, 11 1950, that the appropriative right -- so long as you 12 took the same quantity from the river, you took it from 13 the same point on the river, you put it to the same use, 14 irrigation, on the same acreage -- that you could then 15 change crops, for example. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In II -- in II(H), do you 17 think "beneficial use is hereby defined to be that use 18 by which water supply is depleted" -- and we're looking 19 at "depleted." Do you define "depleted" as what is 20 taken without any reference to what is returned? 21 MR. JAY: I -- I think that that's right. I 22 think I agree, Justice Kennedy, but it has to be a 23 depletive use in the sense that some water -- some water 24 has to come out that doesn't come back. So it's not - 25 it's not the same -- the mill -- a mill race is not a
51

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 depletion, even though some water -- some water comes 2 out because it then -- because it then comes back. But 3 what our - 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, that's - 5 that's the key to this case, I take it. Wyoming is 6 telling us that what goes back is irrelevant so long as 7 what is taken is for a recognized beneficial use. 8 MR. JAY: The reason it's irrelevant, 9 Justice Kennedy, is that -- for two reasons. Depletion 10 is not the measure of beneficial use. It's a -- it is a 11 criterion for beneficial use. The use has to be a 12 depletive one; but it's not the measure of the 13 beneficial use. 14 And the second point, Montana seeks to 15 equate consumption with depletion, and that's -- that's 16 not correct, either. 17 We urge the Court to overrule the exception. 18 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Jay. 20 General, you have 2 minutes left. 21 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE BULLOCK 22 ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF 23 MR. BULLOCK: Mr. Chief Justice, members of 24 the Court: 25 Briefly, that, as Justice Scalia pointed
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 out, this is a compact, and it's a compact between two 2 different States, and Montana gave up things, a right of 3 priority administration across State lines as a result 4 of that. 5 Justice Breyer, as an issue of fairness, we 6 don't get all the water. We only get water supply under 7 like conditions. We are now the downstream 8 appropriator, so -- but one example, if half the water 9 is flowing now that it was, as of 1950, Montana may not 10 get anything at that point, because just by the virtue 11 of -- some say it's "highology," whoever is higher on 12 the river gets to take first. 13 So we -- we don't get to fulfill our rights. 14 All we get is to ensure that, given a like supply of 15 water, that our right shall continue to be enjoyed as it 16 existed as of 1950. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many years has there 18 been not enough water to fill all pre-19 -- forget about 19 whether there was post-1950 use. How many years are we 20 talking about in which there has been not enough water 21 to fill everybody's? 22 MR. BULLOCK: And -- Your Honor, we've done 23 no discovery at all. This is still at the motion to 24 dismiss complaint. And that's what the hydraulics and 25 the engineers will ultimately determine. We made calls
53

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 in 2004 and 2006. 2 We said: Wait a minute, we're not getting 3 enough water here, and we believe it's the -- the 4 pre-1950 uses that are depleting that. Will you give us 5 water? 6 Ultimately, why we're here is to sort this 7 out. 8 I guess I'd also point out that there was 9 some discussion about an appropriative right is the 10 right to use a quantity of water. That makes sense 11 other than if you're in a compact, and Montana gets no 12 water. The Solicitor General even pointed out then in 13 his brief at a footnote -- he said, well, what we might 14 do, then, is that Montana could bring an equitable 15 apportionment action for the pre-1950 water. 16 That highlights the -- I think to me, the 17 illogic of just focusing on the rights and not looking 18 at the uses and how much each State was consuming, 19 because at that point I'll be right back here saying we 20 want the same water under like conditions that we had in 21 1950. 22 Thank you, Your Honor. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General, 24 counsel. 25 The case is submitted.
