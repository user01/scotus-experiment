1 PROCEEDINGS 2 [10:03 a.m.] 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus 5 Genentech. 6 Mr. Kester. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. KESTER 8 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 9 MR. KESTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 As of this morning, it is exactly 70 years ago 12 to the day, minus 4 months, that this Court heard argument 13 challenging the new Federal Declaratory Judgment Act of 14 1934, in an action to construe an insurance contract. 15 And exactly 25 years -- 25 days later, in a 16 unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice Hughes, joined 17 by Justices Stone, Brandeis, and others, the Act was held 18 fully consistent with Article III of the Constitution. 19 This morning, you are here because an action was 20 brought for a declaratory judgment that a biomedical 21 manufacturer need not play -- pay large sums, under a 22 license as patent royalties, under a patent it contends is 23 invalid, unenforceable, and not infringed, but is paying 24 royalties under protest in the meantime. That complaint 25 was ordered dismissed by the Federal Circuit as outside

1 the Article III judicial power of the United States. 2 In detail, the Petitioner, MedImmune, is a 3 biotech company, formed in 1988. During the 1990s -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kester, would it -5 MR. KESTER: Yes? 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- would it -- would 7 your position be different if the contract contained a 8 specific -- the license -- a specific provision specifying 9 that the licensee may not sue? 10 MR. KESTER: No, it would not, Your Honor, 11 because -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- do you think such 13 a provision would be enforceable? 14 MR. KESTER: I doubt it would be enforceable. 15 It would be a matter -- under the Lear case, Lear against 16 Adkins, it would be an -- it would be an affirmative 17 defense if such -- if such a claim were raised. This case 18 is here at the level of subject-matter jurisdiction. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, I don't -- I don't 20 understand what you just said. You mean, it would be 21 enforceable; that if such a suit were brought, the 22 licensor could raise that contractual provision as a basis 23 for dismissing the suit. Is that -24 MR. KESTER: Under 12- -- under 12(b)(6) -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

1 MR. KESTER: -- perhaps. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, then it is enforceable. 3 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but -4 MR. KESTER: No. 5 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- your point is, it's not 6 jurisdictional. 7 MR. KESTER: It's not jurisdictional, exactly, 8 Justice Souter. This is a jurisdictional ruling. And 9 that's all that this Court granted certiorari on. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but as a matter of 11 policy, we, at some point, either in this case or some 12 later case, may have to address the question of whether or 13 not such a provision is enforceable. If it is, we may be 14 -- not be talking about much. It's just going to be 15 boilerplate in every license agreement, and that's the end 16 of it. And it -17 MR. KESTER: And so -18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but it -- on the other 19 hand, it may be that there are reasons not to enforce 20 this, so that we don't have courts flooded with lawsuits, 21 et cetera, et cetera. 22 MR. KESTER: And those reasons, I would suggest, 23 Justice Kennedy, were taken care of in Lear, for the most 24 part, in 1969. Provisions in license contracts that 25 prevent challenges to the contracts are not enforceable

1 under the patent laws of the United States. But then, I 2 -- as I was saying, that is a matter of patent law. 3 That's not a matter of jurisdictional law. We're here -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's look at what 5 might be a matter of jurisdictional law. I take it, from 6 your position, there's nothing preventing Genentech from 7 suing, either, is there? In other words, to establish the 8 validity of their patent. 9 MR. KESTER: It has -- it has happened, on 10 various occasions, that patentees have brought suit to 11 establish the validity of -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Against licensees? 13 MR. KESTER: Against licensees and others. And 14 the -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Against licensees who are not 16 claiming that the patent is invalid? And where is the 17 controversy? 18 MR. KESTER: The controversy could arise in any 19 number of ways. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, I can see, if the -21 if licensee says the patent is invalid, that the patentee 22 says paying its royalties -- how does it -23 MR. KESTER: The patentee could be paying his 24 royalties. The patentee could also be putting ads in the 25 paper saying, "This is not a valid patent." It could --
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 it could have acquired a lot of publicity. And, in the 2 end, there could be reasons, and there have been such 3 cases -- which we cited, 47 of, our brief -- where such 4 suits have been brought. But -5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If it -- if the -- if the -6 if the licensee came into court and said, "I'm not 7 contesting this patent," that would be the end of it, 8 wouldn't it? 9 MR. KESTER: If the licensee said, "I am not 10 contesting that patent," that could be. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, but the patentee 12 would just say, "Look, we have a license. I think the 13 patent's valid, and you owe me a dollar a unit." The 14 licensee said, "Well, I don't think they're -- it's valid, 15 so I owe you nothing." And they settle on a license for 16 50 cents. Why can't the patentee say, "You know, if I get 17 a judicial decision establishing that the patent is valid, 18 I can charge a higher license, either when this agreement 19 expires or for other licenses"? 20 MR. KESTER: That -- I agree with that, Mr. 21 Chief Justice. But the practicality is that a patentee 22 starts out with, essentially, a judgment that the patent 23 is valid. There is a presumption of validity. And to 24 challenge that patent -- that presumption of validity, is 25 a very difficult undertaking. Most of them don't bother.

1 Why would they? If they are receiving -- if they're 2 receiving -3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm trying to see how 4 far you want -- are willing to push your argument that 5 just because there's been an agreement, or perhaps even a 6 settlement, that that somehow or another doesn't moot the 7 controversy, the underlying legal dispute. And it -- I 8 gather your answer to me is that Genentech, or a patentee, 9 can sue, even though they have an existing -- they're 10 getting royalties from the licensee, they can still sue 11 the licensee. 12 MR. KESTER: A settlement does not deprive a 13 Federal Court of subject-matter jurisdiction. That's the 14 narrow point that is before this -- before this Court. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why aren't you -- you said, 16 "The only question before the court is jurisdictional." 17 If that's so, why isn't your position that the Federal 18 Circuit put the wrong label on this, that license is 19 listed in 8(c) as an affirmative defense; so, whatever the 20 outcome should be, the wrong label should -- is -- was 21 used. It shouldn't be a subject-matter jurisdiction, 22 shouldn't be 12(b)(1); it should be an 8(c) affirmative 23 defense. And then the -- you're out of the jurisdiction 24 box, but you're left with the same underlying question. 25 MR. KESTER: But not the same underlying
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 question, Justice Ginsburg, with respect, because then you 2 are in a situation like the business forms case in the 3 Seventh Circuit, which came out shortly after the Lear. 4 There was a settle -- settlement, and the -- and it was 5 argued that the settlement was not effective because of 6 the Lear decision, and parties can't settle themselves out 7 of the Lear decision. But that is all under 12(b)(6), and 8 not 12(b)(1). This case involves a 12(b)(1) motion, not a 9 12(b)(6) -10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what -11 MR. KESTER: -- motion. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- good would it do? Suppose 13 we said, "Federal Circuit, you put the wrong label on it. 14 It should be 12(b)(6), not 12(b)(1), or perhaps even 8(c), 15 affirmative defense"? Then you go back to the Federal 16 Circuit, and they'll come up with the same decision, that, 17 as long as you are licensed and are paying your royalties, 18 you have -- and they just put a different label on it -19 you have -20 MR. KESTER: They -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you have no -- you have 22 not stated a claim. 23 MR. KESTER: That would be effectively 24 overruling Lear, which is what, I think, is what many of 25 the parties in this case actually seek to do.

1 Lear does not allow inhibitions of challenges to 2 patent licenses. A licensee can challenge the validity, 3 the enforceability of the patent. That's because there's 4 a public interest in this, as well. Parties cannot simply 5 contract with each other and prevent a challenge to a -6 to a patent -7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then -8 MR. KESTER: -- license. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the Federal Circuit 10 distinguished Lear, and said what -- in Lear, the licensee 11 had stopped paying royalties. Isn't that so? 12 MR. KESTER: That -- those were the facts of 13 Lear. But -- it happened that way in Lear, but that 14 wasn't the reasoning of Lear. Lear would not totally 15 cover that situation, but we would submit to this Court, 16 it shouldn't make any difference. The reasoning of Lear 17 is the same. The licensee cannot, by contract, be 18 estopped, licensee estoppel, from challenging a patent. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, there's no way, I -20 under your view, that a patent holder can protect itself 21 from suit through any license arrangement or any agreement 22 of any kind. 23 MR. KESTER: I suspect there are many ways, Mr. 24 Chief Justice, but not by throwing them out on a 25 jurisdictional basis at the very first moment of the
10

1 lawsuit. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about -3 MR. KESTER: There may be ways this could be 4 arranged at the second level, through -5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what are those ways -6 I mean, the ones that have been mentioned as possibilities 7 in the Government brief -- one, you rejected, and the 8 other that was mentioned was: if you sue -- if the 9 licensee sues, then the royalty fees will be upped. Would 10 that be effective? 11 MR. KESTER: That is a question that would arise 12 under Lear against Adkins. And the question before this 13 Court in that situation, if it got to this Court, would 14 be, Is that kind of a provision compatible with the policy 15 that was so firmly expressed by Justice Harlan in Lear, 16 and has been reiterated in so many subsequent cases of 17 this Court? 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you have rejected both of 19 the Government's suggestions on what the patent holder 20 might do to protect itself. Do you have anything concrete 21 that you would concede the patent holder could do? 22 MR. KESTER: I don't think that I have rejected 23 both the Government's suggestions. I've said that they 24 raise problems on -- as to the scope of Lear. 25 JUSTICE SOUTER: With respect to -- whether we
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 are talking about a jurisdictional defense or whether we 2 are talking about an affirmative defense, assuming 3 jurisdiction, is there any -- is there any reason for us 4 to accept your position, other than the reason that you 5 have mentioned a number of times, and that is the adoption 6 and encouragement of a public policy that allows patent 7 challenges freely? Is that the nub of our reasoning, if 8 we were to support your position, either jurisdictionally, 9 in this case, or in recognizing -- or the -- in dealing 10 with the affirmative defense in another case? 11 MR. KESTER: Not quite, Justice Souter. I would 12 say the nub of your position is the Altvater case, the 13 Aetna case, the Maryland -14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Altvater is difficult for 15 you, isn't it? Because there was an injunction in 16 Altvater, wasn't there? 17 MR. KESTER: That -- but that -- but was -18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Which raises an entirely 19 different policy issue? 20 MR. KESTER: Well, I would say what it -- what 21 it raises is simply an extra fact, but it wasn't a 22 necessary fact. Because this Court, in Altvater, 23 specifically pointed out that even if there weren't an 24 injunction there, there would be -- there would be the 25 danger forced on the licensee, of an infringement suit;
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and an infringement suit means, possibly, an injunction of 2 the patent, treble damages, any number of sanctions. An 3 injunction suit can put a company out of business, 4 especially like a company like my client here. And -5 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that is -- that is a good 6 reason. And, I take it, it's your logic that that is a 7 good reason to recognize a fairly broad right on the part 8 of the licensee to challenge. 9 MR. KESTER: Right. 10 JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, the nub of your 11 position, as I understand it, is the public policy that 12 favors relative -13 MR. KESTER: It -14 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- freedom to challenge -15 MR. KESTER: It's more -- it's more than public 16 policy, it's Article III. Article III says that you can 17 bring a lawsuit in this situation. And that was settled -18 JUSTICE SOUTER: No -19 MR. KESTER: -- in Aetna. 20 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I realize that. But, I 21 mean, what we've got in this case, and in any of these 22 cases, is a question of line-drawing under Article III. 23 And your argument is, you want to draw the line where you 24 want it drawn primarily because there are practical 25 reasons to favor a public policy of free challenge.

1 MR. KESTER: What we are presenting in this case 2 is a dispute about money. It's not abstract. It's not 3 hypothetical. It's not conjectural. It is concrete, 4 immediate. All the facts are in. It's definitely 5 adversarial. It's legal. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- well, you can have such 7 a dispute on a theoretical question between, I don't know, 8 the ACLU and the National Rifle Association, but that 9 doesn't create a case or controversy. What is the injury, 10 the imminent injury to your -- to your client that is the 11 basis for the case or controversy? 12 MR. KESTER: The -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it anything other than, "I 14 have to pay the royalties that I agreed to pay."? 15 MR. KESTER: It is the -- it is that, "I am 16 having to pay the royalties -- that I say I did not agree 17 to pay, because this is an invalid patent." Money is 18 being paid by my client every quarter, large amounts of 19 money. That is a major injury. 20 JCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you don't -21 MR. KESTER: And if -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- think -23 MR. KESTER: And if -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- if you don't think -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it unlawful to

1 agree to pay somebody money who does not have a patent? 2 MR. KESTER: It is -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you're speaking as 4 though somehow that -- such a contract is contrary to 5 public policy, and void. 6 MR. KESTER: No, we're saying that that isn't 7 what we agreed to. We're saying this is a contract 8 dispute. And the whole purpose of the -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why are you 10 paying it, if you -- if you don't think you owe it? 11 MR. KESTER: Because the -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because of the threat of 13 treble damages -14 MR. KESTER: The threat -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and injunction. 16 MR. KESTER: -- of this -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we're trying to 18 figure out where the public policy is here, why don't we 19 give some weight to those congressional enactments that 20 obviously fortify the strength of the patent? In other 21 words, Congress passed these provisions providing for 22 treble damages for attorneys' fees. And -23 MR. KESTER: But -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and to respond that 25 there's got to be a public policy to counterbalance that,
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Congress can always do that, if it wants; but it didn't -2 it thinks that you need these provisions to protect the 3 patent holders. 4 MR. KESTER: But, Mr. Chief Justice, 5 Congress can also amend the Declaratory Judgment Act, if 6 it wants. And Congress was proud of the Declaratory 7 Judgment Act when it was passed in 1934. And the 8 legislative history of it -- and nothing in the text is 9 contrary, says the purpose of this is so that contracts 10 can be resolved without breach, and judicial 11 determinations can be had. It's like a noninvasive, a 12 less invasive kind of surgery. 13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kester, may I ask you this 14 question? Is it your view that Gen-Probe represented a 15 change in the law? 16 MR. KESTER: Absolutely. 17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Were there -- before Gen-Probe 18 was decided, were there any cases, like this case, that 19 were decided? 20 MR. KESTER: There were many, Your Honor, and 21 they were decided -22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Where the -- where the 23 licensee brought suit challenging validity while the 24 license was still in full -25 MR. KESTER: We --
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- force? 2 MR. KESTER: We had suits in the Third Circuit, 3 the Seventh Circuit, the Second Circuit, and even in the 4 Federal Circuit, in its early days, where it quoted those 5 cases which said, "It is not necessary for the licensee to 6 stop paying payments in order for Article III to be 7 satisfied." 8 This case came as a shock in 2004. And, in 9 fact, the judges below, in this series of cases, all said, 10 "We thought it was settled law the other way." All this 11 case represents, from our point of view, is, "Let's go 12 back to the way it has always been." 13 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kester. 15 Ms. Maynard. 16 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD 17 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 18 MS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 19 please the Court: 20 There is a concrete dispute between the parties 21 about their legal rights and obligations. If that dispute 22 is resolved, money will change hands. That is an Article 23 III case or controversy. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you ever end 25 these things? Let's say they have this dispute, they
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 bring the litigation, and they settle it. They're saying, 2 "Okay, we're going to settle it. Instead of paying a 3 license fee of 50 cents, it's going to be 40 cents, and 4 we'll go on." Then they can sue again, I take it. 5 MS. MAYNARD:: In that situation. Recognizing 6 that's not the situation we have here -7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can they settle that, by 8 the way? Is it all right to settle it, or is -- that 9 interfere with the policy that patents have to be open to 10 challenge? 11 MS. MAYNARD: May I -- if I can answer the first 12 question first. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Either one. 14 MS. MAYNARD: If there were to be a settlement, 15 in the second case, the -- it would not be an Article III 16 case or controversy problem with the second case. And 17 that suit should not be dismissed under 12(b)(1). 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 19 MS. MAYNARD: The -- in that case, the patent 20 holder might have a valid 12(b)(6) defense, and the suit, 21 laying aside enforceability issues that you raised, may be 22 easily resolved, on that ground. But, in terms of the 23 question before the Court today, that wouldn't be an 24 Article III matter. 25 I think, as a policy matter -- so, moving off
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the question before the Court right now -- as a policy 2 matter, the -- it's not clear from this Court's cases 3 exactly what types of agreements would be enforceable. I 4 think there's a spectrum of cases one can imagine, ranging 5 from Pope -- the type of promise that was extracted in 6 Pope, which this Court held was unenforceable -7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think you 8 overread Pope. All Pope said was that they're not going 9 to grant specific performance. In fact, they've said, 10 "Whatever you may think of the policy here, we don't -11 specific performance calls on the equitable discretion, 12 and we're not going to do it." But, I don't read Pope as 13 holding that the clauses are otherwise unenforceable. In 14 -15 MS. MAYNARD: Well -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- other words you're 17 maybe entitled to damages. And that may be measured by 18 the license fee that you agreed to pay. 19 MS. MAYNARD: Well, there certainly would be a 20 question, though, the way that Lear read Pope, and under 21 Lear, about whether a bare agreement not to challenge 22 licenses, especially ones like in Pope, where they agreed 23 not to challenge the license, even beyond the term, would 24 be enforceable. And the Government thinks there's a 25 spectrum. One -- at one end of the spectrum would be
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 licenses like those in Pope, and at the other end of the 2 spectrum would be a consent decree entered after 3 settlement of a bona fide patent infringement suit where 4 the -- which included an agreement not to settle. Now, 5 that's clearly not what we have here. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, is -- if -- I guess there 7 are three possible positions on the question of whether a 8 licensee can attack a contract, a patent where he has a 9 license and wants to keep the contract. One, he can never 10 do it. Two, he can always do it. Three, it depends on 11 what the contract says. Now, do any of those questions 12 have anything to do with the question before us, which is 13 whether it is a case or controversy? 14 MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If we were to reach 16 the question, which is very interesting, "What is the 17 Government's position as to which of those three positions 18 is the right position?" -- were we to reach it -- I agree 19 with you, I don't see it in front of us; but maybe it is 20 -- if it were, what would be your view? 21 MS. MAYNARD: The Government's view is that 22 there's a spectrum along the spectrum, and it would have 23 -- you would have to consider each case on its terms. And 24 it's not clear, from this Court's cases, where the 25 policies in that --
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, basically, 2 though, you're not certain. The Government's view would 3 be, it is a matter as to whether you can sue claiming the 4 patent is invalid, whether the licensee can do it, that 5 probably -- but you're not certain, and you haven't made 6 up your mind definitely, because it is not in this case -7 but you think it's going to be something they could 8 regulate themselves by contract. 9 MS. MAYNARD: It's certainly not foreclosed by 10 this Court's precedent, and it's an open question where 11 the policies -- how they would weigh out. There's no 12 language in this license, however, suggesting any type of 13 settlement. And, moreover, I think it's important to 14 recognize that the parties here actually have a concrete 15 dispute about what the licensing agreement means. Count 16 one in the complaint is asking for a declaration -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you don't think 18 that matters, though, do you? I mean, even if they all 19 agree there's no dispute about what the license agreement 20 means, your position is still the same, right? There is 21 an Article III controversy because they challenge the 22 validity of the patent? 23 MS. MAYNARD: If the parties have a concrete 24 dispute about the validity of the patent, and it would 25 affect their rights and obligations in the way that it
21

1 would here -- in other words, that money will no longer be 2 due to the Respondents if the patent's invalid -3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is -4 MS. MAYNARD: -- and the -5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that always the case? 6 I mean, could -- can you enforce a license agreement based 7 on an invalid patent? You thought it was valid -- parties 8 had a dispute about it -- whether it is valid. You 9 entered into agreement, say, "Well, let's split the 10 difference. We'll -- you know, 50 cents rather than a 11 dollar or nothing." It's determined that the patent is 12 invalid. Can the patentee then still say, "Well, you 13 still owe me the money. We've, kind of, cut -- split the 14 difference. That was part of the agreement"? 15 MS. MAYNARD: It might depend on whether there 16 was consideration beyond the patent itself. In the -- in 17 this -- in this case, though, the Petitioner claims that 18 if the -- if the patent is invalid, they no longer owe 19 licensing fees, and, under Lear, they would be entitled to 20 the licensing fees, that they've paid since they began 21 challenging, back. So, it's clear that under either the 22 contract or a question of -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Contractually? They say that 24 that's their contractual right? 25 MS. MAYNARD: They claim that, under the
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 licensing agreement, they only owe royalties on valid 2 claims. That's count one of the complaint, in the (j) -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does that appear in the 4 licensing agreement? Or -5 MS. MAYNARD: Where does it appear in the 6 licensing agreement? 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I took them as just 8 asserting a general proposition of law -- that, where 9 they've agreed to pay royalties because of a patent, if 10 the patent is invalid, they don't have to pay royalties -11 not because there's some special provision in this 12 contract. 13 MS. MAYNARD: The parties actually have a 14 concrete dispute about the meaning of the licensing 15 agreement in that regard, Justice Scalia. On page 399 of 16 the joint appendix is the provision about which they have 17 a dispute. And the language in there provides that they 18 will pay on substances which would, if not licensed under 19 this agreement, infringe one or more claims of either or 20 both of the Shamir patents, or coexpression patents, which 21 have neither expired nor been held invalid by a court or 22 other body of competent jurisdiction. There was similar 23 language in -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, there's really not much at 25 issue in this case. And that's clearly a case of
23

1 controversy, isn't it? There is a dispute over the 2 meaning of that provision of the agreement. 3 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, there's less here than 5 meets the eye. 6 MS. MAYNARD: That's what the Government 7 believes, Your Honor. 8 It's also -- the licensee also does not need to 9 breach the licensing agreement in order to create a case 10 or controversy. The licensee is currently paying 11 royalties that it does not believe it owes and that it 12 believes it would be entitled to have back if it should 13 prevail on its interpretation of the -- of the patent and 14 the licensing agreement. It doesn't have to make that 15 injury more severe by breaching. That's clear from this 16 Court's decision in Altvater. In Altvater, royalties were 17 being demanded and royalties were being paid, but, 18 nevertheless, this Court held -19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that -- it's 20 been pointed out that was pursuant to an injunction. 21 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, it was pursuant to 22 injunction, but that was not important to the Court's 23 reasoning. What the Court said is, "You need not suffer 24 patent damages in order to bring the suit." Not a 25 contempt. "You need not breach the injunction and put

1 yourself at risk of treble damages for infringement." It 2 was the patent damages that put the licensee at risk, and 3 that's the same risk that the Petitioner faces here and 4 should not have to bear in order to bring suit. 5 The case or controversy is whether or not the -6 they owe the royalties. The whole point of the 7 Declaratory Judgment Act was to allow contracting parties 8 not to have to sever their ongoing contractual relations 9 in order to get disputes resolved between -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think -11 MS. MAYNARD: -- themselves. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think there would 13 be a case or controversy if Genentech were suing to 14 establish the validity of its patent? 15 MS. MAYNARD: In the situation that we have 16 here, Your Honor? 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 18 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, I do. Where the Petitioner 19 claims that the patent is invalid, that they could -- that 20 the Petitioner's claims unsettles their right, damages 21 their property value, potentially, and that they could 22 bring a declaratory judgment action of validity. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: And what would their -- what 24 would their concrete injury be?

MAYNARD: It -- from the moment -- the 6 Petitioner has an argument that from the moment it ceased 7 -- it starts claiming that the patent is invalid and pays 8 under protest, that it is entitled to those royalties 9 back. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -11 MS. MAYNARD: The -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- so long as they're still 13 paying the royalties, isn't that sort of an abstract 14 disagreement? I mean, it's sort of like the ACLU saying 15 that the patent's invalid. You know, it's a nice 16 theoretical question that we can argue about, but as long 17 as they're paying the royalties, where's the concrete 18 injury? 19 MS. MAYNARD: Well, I think, technically, 20 Justice Scalia, they probably have a claim for patent 21 infringement, to which the defense, as Justice Ginsburg -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -23 MS.

MAHONEY 25 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 2 please the Court: 3 I'd like to start with the fact that there are 4 four counts in the complaint for declaratory relief. The 5 first one is styled as a -- contractual relations claims. 6 The other three are styled as patent law claims. And it's 7 important to emphasize, at the outset, that this Court, in 8 Skelly Oil, in Calderone, and in, really, all of the 9 cases, has said it's very important to look behind the 10 labels that a Declaratory Judgment Act plaintiff puts on 11 their claims. We need to actually see what is the cause 12 of action they're trying to adjudicate so we can do an 13 accurate assessment of justiciability -- standing, 14 ripeness, Federal-question jurisdiction. 15 I want to start by explaining why there is no 16 contract claim at issue here. You heard today, they're 17 trying to salvage this, say that there's a contract 18 dispute, a dispute about the terms of the contract. They 19 didn't argue that below, and with good reason. And I'd 20 just point you to the briefs in the Federal Circuit. 21 Roman numeral I, which is all about the improper dismissal 22 of the Declaratory Judgment Act claims, refers to the fact 23 these are, quote, "patent-law claims," end quote, at page 24 27. Nowhere do they say that there is a dispute about the 25 proper interpretation of the contract terms. And let me
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 explain why. 2 The contract terms, which were just read to you, 3 is Section 110 of -- 1.10 at JA-399 of the license -- says 4 that there is an obligation to pay royalties for Synagis 5 on any claim -- not any valid claim, any claim -- that has 6 not been held invalid by a court or other competent 7 jurisdiction from which no appeal has, or may, be taken. 8 Now, they never said, below, "That clause means that we 9 can come to court and have the court decide whether this 10 patent is valid, and, depending on whether we win or not, 11 then we can stop paying." And the reason they didn't make 12 that argument is, it was rejected by this Court a hundred 13 years ago, in United States versus Harvey Steel. Very 14 similar clause. The United States says, "This means that 15 we don't have to pay if the patent is invalid." And, in 16 an opinion by Justice Holmes, this Court rejected it out 17 of hand by -- and said, "This was a conventional proviso. 18 We don't even need to look to evidence of the party's 19 intent, because this is the standard proviso. It does not 20 mean" -- and they said it was a "twisted interpretation" 21 that the Government was offering -- it doesn't mean that 22 the licensee, quote, "thought the patent bad and would 23 like to have the Court say so now," end quote. Yet that 24 is exactly -25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that a case about Article
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 III case or controversy? 2 MS. MAHONEY: It is, in the following sense, 3 Your Honor. They can't just show up here today and say, 4 "Well, there really is a dispute about the contract." But 5 they never argued, below, and is foreclosed -6 JUSTICE BREYER: Shouldn't we send that back? I 7 mean, I thought we were here to decide one question, that 8 the Federal Circuit has said that, "Unless there is a 9 reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit, you can't bring a 10 declaratory judgment action, because of the Constitution 11 of the United States." Now, I have to admit, I've looked 12 up, or I've had my law clerk look up, probably now 13 hundreds of cases, and we can't find, in any case, such a 14 requirement. Indeed, the very purpose -- as I -- we've 15 just heard the SG say, of this act, the Declaratory 16 Judgment Act, seems to be to allow people who -- a 17 contract -- who are in a real concrete disagreement, to 18 get a declaratory judgment without getting rid of the 19 contract. But I might be wrong about that. 20 But you've now argued a different point. 21 MS. MAHONEY: Well -22 JUSTICE BREYER: So, isn't the right thing for 23 us to do, to decide the issue in front of us and then send 24 it back? If you're right that they have to pay, whether 25 they win or lose; if they're right that they promise not
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to sue; if you're right on 14 other grounds, you might 2 win. But should we decide those grounds today? Why? 3 MS. MAHONEY: Well, first of all, with respect 4 to this issue, whether there would be jurisdiction over a 5 real live contract dispute, they never argued it, Your 6 Honor. It's not part of this case. The Federal Circuit 7 didn't address it, because they didn't argue it, because 8 it's foreclosed by -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question -10 MS. MAHONEY: -- a precedent a hundred -11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The question that is 12 presented to us -- whatever they suggested at this oral 13 argument that wasn't in III, the question it presented to 14 us is, Was the Federal Circuit right when they said, "You 15 have no access to a declaratory judgment unless there is a 16 reasonable apprehension that you will be sued"? 17 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, that is the right -18 that is the right starting point for a test, depending on 19 the cause of action they're seeking to adjudicate. In 20 here, what the Federal Circuit properly understood is that 21 they are seeking to adjudicate affirmative defenses to an 22 infringement action under the patent laws. 23 And, just like in Steffel, if you're trying to 24 adjudicate, on an anticipatory basis, an enforcement 25 action, you have to show that you would reasonably fear
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that enforcement action. And, in fact, Steffel uses that 2 language, and Poe versus Ullman dismisses a case for 3 failure to establish a genuine fear of prosecution. But 4 then, you have to go one step beyond, and that is to say, 5 Are they -- is the cause of action not ripening because 6 the declaratory judgment plaintiff is forfeiting their 7 legal rights in order to avoid some very severe harm that 8 would be cognizable coercion? That's the test that's used 9 in Steffel for -- in essence, being able to test a -10 defenses to a cause of action that -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: And why -12 MS. MAHONEY: -- an enforcement action. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- doesn't that work here? 14 MS. MAHONEY: It doesn't work here, for several 15 reasons. Most fundamentally, this is a settlement. I 16 mean, Mr. Steffel did not enter into a settlement or a 17 compromise with the prosecutor. He wasn't complying 18 because he was under an agreement to do so. Here, it has 19 been settled for -- forever, that if a -- an agreement -20 if you're making payments pursuant to an agreement, in the 21 nature of a compromise, you can't come and say that it's 22 been coerced or it's a form of duress. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the -24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why should we accept the 25 characterization that it's a compromise? As I -- and
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 maybe I'm just factually wrong here? I thought, at the 2 time they entered into the license agreement, they had 3 some disagreements about the scope of the then-patent, the 4 scope of the anticipated patent, and so on, and they 5 couldn't very well be resolved. But they were -- they 6 were not settling, in the -- in the classic sense of the 7 word, a -- let us say, a focus claim, one against the 8 other. 9 MS. MAHONEY: I think the answer, Your Honor, 10 is, they weren't settling, for all time, in the sense that 11 they could never get out of the deal. Certainly, they 12 could repudiate and then go ahead and sue. But yet, at 13 page 3 of their petition, they expressly say, the reason 14 they entered into this agreement was in order to avoid the 15 costs and risks of litigation. It is the reason -16 JUSTICE SOUTER: But had they gotten to the 17 point, prior to the execution of the contract, in which 18 one party was saying, "You may not do this," and the other 19 party was saying, "Oh, yes I can," so that there -- there 20 was a focus controversy that would have been the subject 21 matter of a conventional lawsuit, then and there, had 22 there not been this license agreement? 23 MS. MAHONEY: Not exactly, but what they did was 24 they headed it off at the pass. They understood that -25 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the question is, How far
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 ahead of the pass can they get and still call it a 2 settlement?" in the sense that you're using that term. 3 MS. MAHONEY: It's a compromise. It's a 4 compromise of the very claims they're trying to adjudicate 5 here. What they want to adjudicate are affirmative 6 defenses to a patent infringement action. That is not a 7 ripe claim, and there is not sufficient immediacy, because 8 they are preventing that claim from ripening by continuing 9 to make voluntary payments -10 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -11 MS. MAHONEY: -- under their -12 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you -13 MS. MAHONEY: -- agreement. 14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. But you were saying 15 that the status of that agreement, for purposes of the 16 jurisdictional question here, is exactly the same as the 17 status of an agreement that they might have entered into 18 after one party had brought suit against the other. And 19 -20 MS. MAHONEY: Well -21 JUSTICE SOUTER: And they -- they had settled. 22 And then, later on, somebody wanted to repudiate the 23 settlement. 24 MS. MAHONEY: I don't know if it's exactly the 25 status. For instance, in a settlement after litigation

1 has been filed, I think that Lear would say that you can't 2 even repudiate that. But certainly -- so, there might be 3 some differences -- but from -4 JUSTICE SOUTER: In any event -5 MS. MAHONEY: -- the standpoint of coercion -6 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- it's equivalent to a 7 settlement after a formal demand has been made. 8 MS. MAHONEY: It is equivalent to that, in the 9 following sense. They understood that if they -- if they 10 didn't get a license, that they would be exposed to 11 Genentech's claims under the -- under the infringement 12 laws. And in order to avoid that exposure, even though 13 they had all the information they needed to assess the 14 validity of this patent at the time -15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose they didn't have all 16 the information. Suppose you enter into a license 17 agreement -- you're convinced, as the one that's going to 18 pay the license fee, that it's a good patent -- after the 19 agreement's signed, the technological advances, other 20 disclosures, indicate that the patent is deficient. Could 21 you sue then? 22 MS. MAHONEY: No, I don't think so, unless -23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but then -- so then, the 24 argument that you've made is just not -25 MS. MAHONEY: No, I --

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- relevant for us, the fact 2 that they knew everything -3 MS. MAHONEY: They did. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it also means that this 5 isn't really a settlement, in any respect. 6 MS. MAHONEY: It's a compromise of claims that 7 could be brought. 8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Mahoney, can I ask this 9 question? Supposing at the time they negotiate the 10 license agreement there's some uncertainty about whether 11 the patent is valid or not. So, at the end of the license 12 agreement -- they agree on the royalties, the term, and 13 the -- everything it covers, but they put in a provision 14 and say, "We're not entirely sure the patent is valid, so 15 we reserve the right to bring an action challenging the 16 validity of the patent. We will pay royalties in the 17 meantime, and the -- you will accept these royalties as 18 sufficient for the use of the patent, that, if we win, you 19 don't have to pay royals, if we lose, you do." Would that 20 be a valid provision? 21 MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, but that would 22 certainly be a closer case if there -23 JUSTICE STEVENS: But would it -24 MS. MAHONEY: But I -25 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- not be precisely the same

1 issue as a jurisdictional matter as to whether there's a 2 case or controversy? 3 MS. MAHONEY: No, I don't think so, because the 4 real issue, in terms of Steffel, is whether you can say 5 that the party is being coerced. And, at least in your 6 hypothetical, you could say that they have -7 JUSTICE STEVENS: He's not being coerced, but 8 he's bargaining a little better royalty rate than he'll -9 otherwise would have to pay. 10 MS. MAHONEY: Well, in terms of whether they're 11 -- if the parties expressly agreed that that was part of 12 their deal, then you at least wouldn't say that there was 13 an issue of coercion. But here, that isn't what happened. 14 Instead, they used -15 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm really asking -16 MS. MAHONEY: -- a standard proviso -17 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- whether the parties could 18 agree to create a case or controversy. 19 MS. MAHONEY: I think probably not, Your Honor. 20 I think -21 JUSTICE BREYER: Let's suppose -22 MS. MAHONEY: -- that that's one of the -23 JUSTICE BREYER: Well -24 MS.

MAHONEY: Uh-huh. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I'd like to also assume -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I have a review of the 7 bidding? What -8 [Laughter.] 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Go back -- what is the 10 hypothetical -11 JUSTICE BREYER: The hypothetical is -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Continue on. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: -- that they write into the 14 contract -- the party who's the licensee says, "And we 15 stipulate that the licensee thinks that the patent is 16 invalid." Nonetheless, the licensee wants a license, for 17 business reasons. Therefore, the licensee and the 18 licensor agrees that, after they sign the contract and 19 he's paying a thousand dollars a month in royalties, he 20 can go into court and challenge the patent." So, we 21 assume that's written into the contract. 22 MS. MAHONEY: Uh-huh. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: And now, let us also assume a 24 state of the law. The state of the law is that there is 25 no public policy or any other policy that forbids such a
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 condition in a contract. All right? 2 Now, on those two assumptions, the next thing 3 that happens is that the licensee asks for a declaratory 4 judgment that the patent is invalid. 5 On those assumptions, is there a case or 6 controversy under the Federal Constitution? If not, why 7 not? 8 MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, because I think 9 what they're really asking for is advice about a business 10 deal under those circumstances. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: But he says, by the way, "If I 12 win, I will, in fact, save $42 billion a year in licenses" 13 -14 MS. MAHONEY: Yes. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: -- "I would other have to pay." 16 And the other side will -- or -- I was a thousand dollars, 17 I meant 42 billion, okay? 18 [Laughter.] 19 MS.

And that has -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't there -14 MS. MAHONEY: -- is something -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- true adversity?

MAHONEY: If the patent has been -- under 9 Lear and other cases, if a patent has been held to be 10 invalid by a final decision of a court, then I think it is 11 improper for a licensee to seek to obtain -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Collective -13 MS.

MAHONEY: -- for that. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the royalty agreement 17 says, you know, "We have a dispute about the validity of 18 this patent. We don't know. We disagree. And so, we've 19 entered into a compromise royalty rate that reflects the 20 uncertainty." But once it's determined to be invalid, the 21 license fees are not collectible. 22 MS. MAHONEY: I think that that is correct, Your 23 Honor, under the -- under the current state of the law. 24 JUSTICE SOUTER: One further -- on further 25 wrinkle.

If the -- if 9 the point is that it is actually invalid, illegal, that -10 that may be a different case, although I think there would 11 still be an estoppel argument, that they should not be 12 permitted to bring that action without giving up the 13 benefits of the bargain, which is the immunity from suit. 14 I mean, that is one of the fundamental problems with this 15 case. 16 JUSTICE SOUTER: But do you see -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your argument 18 -- I'm sorry. 19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if -- do you see a 20 difference between -- I guess you're saying there's no 21 difference between my added wrinkle on the hypo and the 22 Chief Justice's hypo, for jurisdictional purposes. 23 MS.

Alderson Reporting Company

1 MS.

MAHONEY: That makes no difference, Your 9 Honor. The fact is that they are making the payments 10 pursuant to an agreement. They're not under compulsion of 11 an injunction. They're doing it because they voluntarily 12 entered into it. Altvater is completely different. 13 There, there was no license agreement in force. The 14 courts found that it -- that the reissue patents were 15 never part of the agreement, to begin with. In other 16 words, Altvater never agreed to pay royalties. Altvater 17 had been sued, so there wasn't a counterclaim for 18 invalidity. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the -20 MS.

Would that be a "case or

I don't think any court has ever allowed 5 that. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- it's -- no, the 7 patent -- the licensee is coming into court and wants a 8 declaration of invalidity so it can manufacture without 9 the fear of an infringement suit. 10 MS.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- "we want a declaration of 2 infringement." And the patent holder doesn't take the 3 position that you're taking; instead says, "I'm prepared 4 to fight this out now. I know that I have the license, 5 which could be an affirmative defense, but I'm not going 6 to raise it. I'm going to go head to head on the validity 7 of this patent." Would that be a case or controversy? 8 MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor, 9 because I don't think the parties are allowed to just 10 decide, "Well, we'd like to do this now," when they're -11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, even -12 MS. MAHONEY: -- they've treated -13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- even if the patent holder 14 chooses not to raise the license, the court would have to, 15 on its own motion, say, "Sorry, you didn't -- you're not 16 the master of your defense. We decide that you have to 17 effectively plead the license." 18 MS. MAHONEY: I think the plaintiff has to show 19 that they are here pursuant to -- that they have a legal 20 right that permits them to adjudicate the issue of 21 validity. What the -- what the patent owner does, or not, 22 I don't think turns this into a case or controversy; that, 23 instead, we have to start with the fundamental question, 24 "What is the cause of action that they are attempting to 25 adjudicate? Is it a contract action or is it a -- an
46

1 action under the patent laws? Is it an infringement 2 action?" Here, I don't think there's any question but 3 that it is -- they're trying to adjudicate an action for 4 an infringement that can't arise, because they're immune 5 from suit, because they continue to make their payments. 6 And, under those circumstances, it is not sufficiently 7 immediate to establish jurisdiction in -8 JUSTICE BREYER: It is -9 MS. MAHONEY: -- this Court. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- it is, under other fields of 11 the law, isn't it? I mean, I imagine that the very -- we 12 see, all the time, declaratory judgments where a State 13 passes a law and the individual says, "Well, I think this 14 is unconstitutional, but my preferences are not to go to 15 jail; my preferences are not to be penalized. So, my 16 first choice is unconstitutional and my second is to obey 17 it." There's no possibility in the world that he will 18 violate that law. And yet, we've often held that, with 19 regulations, you have to have the other requirements. You 20 have to have the requirements that it's concrete, it's not 21 just ideological, there's real harm. But, if those other 22 requirements that are fulfilled, I've never seen any where 23 it said that there also has to be a reasonable 24 apprehension of a lawsuit in the absence of the 25 declaratory judgment. I've just never found that phrase,

MAHONEY: Your Honor, Poe versus Ullman, 3 this Court actually dismissed a declaratory judgment -4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, there are many dismissed, 5 for the reasons that they aren't concrete, definite -6 there are a lot of reasons why to dismiss it. I'm just 7 wondering if there is an additional reason that there has 8 to be a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit in the 9 absence of the declaratory judgment action. It's that 10 phrase that I've never found anywhere -11 MS. MAHONEY: We -12 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- and can't think of any 13 reason why that would be an additional constitutional 14 requirement. And I'm putting that directly to you, 15 because I want to hear you give me the counterexamples. 16 MS. MAHONEY: Well -- but in Poe versus Ullman, 17 it was a declaratory judgment action. They were seeking 18 to have a statute declared unconstitutional. And this 19 Court did dismiss, because they didn't have a reasonable 20 fear that they would actually be prosecuted. Dismissed 21 for lack of jurisdiction. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: And you say there has never 23 been a declaratory judgment action, except in the instance 24 where, in the absence of the action, the person would have 25 violated the law, if it's a Government law. In other

MAHONEY: But there is always a reasonable 19 apprehension, and there was always a finding of coercion. 20 Poe versus Ullman says you can't do it unless there is -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do I remember that -22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Poe versus Ullman was a 23 case in which, even if there was a violation of the law, 24 there was going to be no prosecution. 25 MS. MAHONEY: That's why they didn't --

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: He -- but, in this -- in this 2 case, if there's a failure to -- of -- conform to the 3 terms of the license agreement, there's going to be a 4 lawsuit. So, I think Poe versus Ullman is just not 5 relevant. 6 MS. MAHONEY: That -- it goes to the next point, 7 which is that there still has to be a coercive choice. 8 You have to choose -- there, they're choosing to give up 9 constitutional rights in order to avoid jail and 10 imprisonment, arrest and prosecution. Here -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but -12 MS. MAHONEY: -- what's at issue -13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but, in Poe versus Ullman, 14 the ultimate action was basically like violating the 15 contract here, and that's why it's not an applicable 16 precedent. 17 MS. MAHONEY: I don't -- I don't think it's like 18 violating the contract here, though, Your Honor, because, 19 What are the consequences here? What is the choice? 20 First of all, they actually owe the royalties under the 21 agreement, so they're trying to escape their bargain, not 22 enforce it. That's number one. So, they're not 23 forfeiting any rights under the contract, they're simply 24 trying to get out of the contract. 25 Number two, the consequences here, the choice

1 they're talking about, isn't in the nature of coercion. 2 Again, they're not being arrested or prosecuted. All 3 they're going to do if they walk out of this agreement, if 4 they stop paying royalties -- yes, they may well be sued 5 for infringement -- but, if they do, all they face is the 6 loss of their discount. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: But your argument seems -8 MS. MAHONEY: That's -9 JUSTICE ALITO: -- to be based on their having 10 implicitly given up their right to sue. Isn't that right? 11 That was your main argument. This is a settlement. This 12 is in the nature of the settlement. As part of the 13 bargain, the patent holder promises not to sue for 14 infringement. 15 MS. MAHONEY: It's not based on them giving up 16 their right to sue, in the sense that all they have to do 17 is stop paying royalties, and they can sue. They have to 18 -19 JUSTICE ALITO: But in answer to the 20 hypotheticals, you seem to say it wouldn't matter if they 21 explicitly did not give up their right to sue. So, what 22 is left of this argument that what's involved here is 23 essentially a settlement? 24 MS. MAHONEY: Well, it is in the nature of a 25 compromise, Your Honor, and there's nothing in this
51

Alderson Reporting Company

1 agreement that gives them a right to sue. They have to 2 find some legal right. What they're really saying -- what 3 their argument has always been is that Lear actually 4 creates an implied right of action for a licensee to sue 5 at any time of their choosing. That's been their argument 6 from the beginning. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, their concrete 8 right is, as I thought you conceded earlier, that if the 9 patent is declared invalid, they will not owe license 10 fees. 11 MS. MAHONEY: That's true. But that's getting 12 the cart before the horse. What this Court said in -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's what -14 MS. MAHONEY: -- U.S. v. Harvey Steel is -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- a declaratory 16 judgment action does, though, isn't it? 17 MS. MAHONEY: Well, I don't think so, Your 18 Honor. I think every single contract case in the lower 19 courts where they have allowed a suit to be brought on a 20 contract prior to breach, there was a genuine dispute 21 about the interpretation of the terms. Here, what they're 22 trying to do is adjudicate a cause of action outside of 23 the contract. They're trying to adjudicate an 24 infringement action and then say, "Aha, see what I have? 25 I have a judgment that the patent's invalid. And so, now

1 I'd like to say that I don't have to pay royalties under 2 my contract." 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Mahoney, the patent bar is 4 sort of specialized -- more than "sort of" -- it's a 5 specialized bar, and I've never -- I've never been a part 6 of it. Do you agree with the statement of the 7 Petitioner's counsel that Gen-Probe came as a -- as a 8 shock to the -9 MS. MAHONEY: As a -- I do not agree that it 10 came as a shock. And, in fact, I think that Warner 11 Jenkinson, which is a Second Circuit case that allowed 12 this kind of action back in the '70s, was one of the only 13 cases ever that allowed it. And other reasons were found 14 to dismiss similar kinds of claims. In Gen-Probe, it was 15 a surprise that a licensee could do this. It -- the law 16 -- by the time that this license was executed in the 17 Federal Circuit, there was a case, called Shell Oil, where 18 the Court specifically held that a licensee cannot take 19 advantage of the protections of Lear until it has 20 repudiated the license, stopped paying, and said that it 21 wants to challenge validity. So that was the background 22 rule that was in force at the time of this license. And 23 then, when you couple that with the fact that -24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that wasn't -- the 25 District Court, in this very case, seemed to say, "I think
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 this suit should go forward, but there's Gen-Probe, and I 2 must follow Gen-Probe." The District Court, at least as I 3 read it, seemed to think that Gen-Probe moved in a 4 different direction from where the Federal Circuit was 5 before. 6 MS. MAHONEY: In all of the prior Federal 7 Circuit cases, the licensee had stopped paying royalties. 8 And what the Court explained in Gen-Probe is that that is 9 the sine qua non, that a licensee can't establish 10 jurisdiction, and it can't establish a right to challenge 11 validity, if it's still paying royalties. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Mahoney, you argue, 13 in the alternative, that we should dismiss it on the basis 14 of equitable considerations under the Declaratory Judgment 15 Act. We can't reach that argument unless we rule against 16 you on the Article III question. Is that right? 17 MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor. I 18 think you can, because I think that you can do it as an 19 alternative threshold prudential jurisdictional dismissal 20 in the nature -21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We would have to be 22 assuming that we had jurisdiction, wouldn't we? 23 MS. MAHONEY: I think that -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under Article III? 25 MS. MAHONEY: I think that a prudential
54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 dismissal under Article III would also be fine, and that 2 Steel Co. would allow for that kind of dismissal, because 3 Wilton said that you can dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, 4 at the front end, on prudential grounds if you know that 5 there would not be relief allowed at the back end. 6 And I think that there's no need for a remand to 7 do this. We are really talking about an equitable rule 8 that has governed equitable actions for 300 years. It is 9 a -10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what -- but jurisdiction 11 is a question of power, Does the Court have the power to 12 do this? A discretion question is different. It's, "We 13 have the power to entertain this case, but, as a matter of 14 equity, we're not going to do so." The power question, I 15 think, is a -- one that's -- it's either yes or no, either 16 the court has the power, or doesn't. 17 MS. MAHONEY: But I don't think that the Court 18 has to answer that question in order to dismiss on a 19 prudential ground, a prudential jurisdictional ground, and 20 nor is there a need for a remand in Samuels versus 21 Mackell, and in Cardinal, for instance. Those are cases 22 where the Court adopted prudential rules and went ahead 23 and applied them without remand. I -- and no remand's 24 necessary. The Federal Circuit has already looked at 25 this.

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Mahoney, can I ask you one 2 question before your light goes off? I know it's not -3 goes to the "case or controversy" issue, but, in your 4 view, was the bringing of this action a material breach of 5 an implied condition of the contract that would justify a 6 termination of a license? 7 MS. MAHONEY: It would depend on whether there 8 is an implied covenant, Your Honor. It wasn't -9 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm asking you whether -10 MS. MAHONEY: -- argued below. 11 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- you think there was. 12 MS. MAHONEY: I think it -- it may well be, but 13 I don't think the answer in this case turns on it, because 14 I think they have to have their own right to bring the 15 action, whether it's a breach or not, and that they don't. 16 Because they don't have an implied right of action under 17 Lear, they don't have a right to bring this action. And 18 that is an essential component of their ability to 19 challenge the issue of validity. So, I think that's the 20 first and fundamental -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if that's so, and it's a 22 super-violation of an implied covenant, and I guess you 23 could get damages. 24 MS. MAHONEY: I think that their theory, Your 25 Honor, is that a licensee can do this at any time, and

It's been a -- it's been 8 here throughout. If it -- if it even matters. I mean, we 9 wouldn't concede that that -- that that would even matter. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But was it raised before 11 the Federal Circuit? 12 MR. KESTER: Yes. The whole record was -- you 13 mean was it argued -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 15 MR. KESTER: I believe it was. I'd have to go 16 back and -- you mean in terms of the oral argument. It 17 was certainly in the briefs. It was certainly not waived. 18 There was never, of course, any -- anything in 19 the license, or anyplace else, where Petitioner gave up 20 the right to sue. Petitioner doesn't need permission in 21 the license to sue. 22 And as for the shock in the lower courts when 23 this case was decided, I would call to your attention what 24 the Federal Circuit, in 1983, itself, said, and it quoted 25 the Warner-Jenkinson case, which was the Second Circuit
58

1 case that my friend dismissed somewhat. The C.R. Bard 2 case -- this is Federal Circuit, early -- starts out, the 3 opening line -- it says, and I quote -- this is 716 F.2d 4 875 -- "We hold that a patent license need not be 5 terminated before a patent licensee may bring a Federal 6 declaratory judgment action," close quote. And the last 7 words of the same opinion, at 882 of 716 F.2d, are, "We 8 hold that a patent licensee may bring a Federal 9 declaratory judgment action to declare the Federal -- to 10 declare the patent subject to the license invalid without 11 prior termination of the -- of the license." That was 12 1983. Gen-Probe was 2004. Something happened in the 13 interval. 14 Finally, the discussion of settlements here 15 strikes me as, indeed, strange, because if this -- if a 16 license were to be redesignated as a settlement, we would 17 have the situation here where -- a license was signed in 18 1977; the only patent at issue in this case was not even 19 issued until 2001. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kester. 21 MR.
