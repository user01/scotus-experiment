 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 next in Number 01-1435, Clackamas Gastroenterology
 5 Association versus Deborah Wells.
 6 Mr. Seymour.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN W. SEYMOUR
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 9 MR. SEYMOUR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 10 please the Court:
 11 The four doctors who are shareholder-directors
 12 of the petitioner are not employees under the ADA, the
 13 Americans With Disabilities Act, because, like partners,
 14 they own and manage their own clinic.
 15 QUESTION: What -- what is the common law rule
 16 on respondeat superior for an ordinary corporation vis a
 17 vis a director? Is a director of an ordinary corporation
 18 an employee of the corporation?
 19 MR. SEYMOUR: In an ordinary corporation, the
 20 common law rule is that the employee is like a servant. 
 21 QUESTION: Well, if -- if that's so --
 22 QUESTION: Well, what is your answer?
 23 QUESTION: I didn't hear you.
 24 QUESTION: I couldn't hear the response.
 25 MR. SEYMOUR: I'm sorry.

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Your answer was yes, was -- he is an
 2 employee?
 3 MR. SEYMOUR: Yes.
 4 QUESTION: Okay. Well, then Darden says common
 5 law, common law says directors are employees, and these
 6 are directors, end of case. Why not?
 7 MR. SEYMOUR: Because Darden doesn't apply here. 
 8 Darden was --
 9 QUESTION: Well, you didn't even cite Darden, I
 10 don't think.
 11 MR. SEYMOUR: I believe I did.
 12 QUESTION: Did you?
 13 MR. SEYMOUR: Yes.
 14 QUESTION: I would think Darden would be the
 15 first place we'd look.
 16 MR. SEYMOUR: Well, the difference between this
 17 case and Darden is significant. Darden was a case in
 18 which the Court was required to determine whether an
 19 individual was an independent contractor --
 20 QUESTION: Yes.
 21 MR. SEYMOUR: -- or an employee.
 22 QUESTION: Yes.
 23 MR. SEYMOUR: That's not a choice here.
 24 QUESTION: No, but the decision has to be made
 25 on whether these people are employees.

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SEYMOUR: That's right.
 2 QUESTION: And Darden says, well, we're going to
 3 look to the common law, so what makes you think we'd do
 4 something else in this situation?
 5 MR. SEYMOUR: Because there are frankly not much
 6 common law that gives us guidance on how to decide whether
 7 a director-shareholder in a professional corporation is an
 8 employee or not.
 9 The -- in Darden, it cited factors that are
 10 really quite good at determining whether an individual is
 11 an independent contractor or an employee. Those factors
 12 don't work very well here, because they're not designed to
 13 address the issues that we're looking at.
 14 That is, for example, one of the factors that
 15 the common law looks to to determine whether a -- an
 16 individual is an independent contractor is whether the
 17 individual provides their own tools of the trade. Well,
 18 that's not the kind of factor that's going to work very
 19 well in this kind of case. Therefore, we're suggesting
 20 that a Darden-like analysis is very appropriate, but we
 21 think that it's better to use factors such as suggested by
 22 the Government in their brief, that is, the EEOC guidance,
 23 because those kinds of factors suggested in the EEOC
 24 guidance go the heart of the difference between
 25 shareholder-directors and employees.

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 The factors in Darden do not, so therefore the
 2 Darden factors are like trying to pound a round peg into a
 3 square hole. We shouldn't do that, because it becomes
 4 clumsy.
 5 QUESTION: It may be clumsy --
 6 QUESTION: But this was a case where it was very
 7 important to the shareholders in this corporation that
 8 they be labeled employees for ERISA purposes. It had to
 9 be -- if they weren't employees, they weren't going to be
 10 able to get themselves covered under the retirement plan
 11 as the law then was, so in -- in the ERISA context you
 12 would be saying, of course they're employees. That's how
 13 they qualified under ERISA. We set this thing up solely
 14 for that reason.
 15 MR. SEYMOUR: Yes, Your Honor, except that I
 16 think that the -- the tax purposes were more under the
 17 general tax laws, not under ERISA, because they could
 18 establish an ERISA plan and deduct the expenses.
 19 QUESTION: But didn't they -- in order to be
 20 covered, didn't they have to be employees?
 21 MR. SEYMOUR: Yes.
 22 QUESTION: Yes.
 23 MR. SEYMOUR: And -- and just --
 24 QUESTION: And they wouldn't -- on your theory,
 25 they're not -- so they are employees for that purpose?

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SEYMOUR: Well, they're treated as employees
 2 for that purpose, but they should not be treated as
 3 employees for purposes of the ADA.
 4 For example, if we turn the coin over and look
 5 at the other side, and the Court is required to examine
 6 whether someone who is labeled a partner is, in reality,
 7 a -- an employee. If the Court finds that, looking at the
 8 economic realities of that situation, that the partner is
 9 really an employee, that doesn't mean that the
 10 now-employer should issue W-2's, or that they should have
 11 been withholding. Those are tax issues, and they don't
 12 have the same purposes as the ADA.
 13 QUESTION: But the -- am I wrong in thinking
 14 that the -- the whole thing was set up the way it was,
 15 instead of as a partnership, for the reason that these
 16 people needed to be characterized as employees for
 17 retirement plan purposes?
 18 MR. SEYMOUR: Yes.
 19 QUESTION: And are they not also employees for
 20 Worker's Compensation purposes?
 21 MR. SEYMOUR: Under Oregon law, they can opt out
 22 of Worker's Compensation.
 23 QUESTION: But they'd have to opt out. They
 24 start out by being in.
 25 MR. SEYMOUR: Yes.

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: They start out as being -- do they
 2 get salaries?
 3 MR. SEYMOUR: They get salaries plus a bonus,
 4 which is the division of their profits.
 5 QUESTION: But they get salaries. There's
 6 nothing inconsistent with being, say, the president of the
 7 company and principal shareholder and being both an owner
 8 and an employee.
 9 MR. SEYMOUR: That's true. There's nothing
 10 inconsistent about that, and our concern with this case
 11 is, the court didn't go past the fact that the clinic was
 12 organized as a professional corporation, and when the --
 13 QUESTION: Why should it, because I'm still
 14 stuck with the language of Darden, which reads as a
 15 general rule, when Congress has used the term, employee,
 16 without defining it, we have concluded that Congress
 17 intended to describe the conventional master-servant
 18 relationship as understood by common law agency doctrine,
 19 and it says, that rule stood as an independent authority
 20 for the copyright decision. So, too, should it stand
 21 here.
 22 Now, is your view, it should not stand here in
 23 this case --
 24 MR. SEYMOUR: That's our view.
 25 QUESTION: -- as sufficient?

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SEYMOUR: That's our view.
 2 QUESTION: All right, so you're asking us to
 3 depart from Darden and to make an exception from the
 4 Darden rule for the -- this particular act.
 5 MR. SEYMOUR: For this --
 6 QUESTION: Is that right?
 7 MR. SEYMOUR: For this particular circumstance,
 8 that's correct, Your Honor.
 9 QUESTION: Well, when you say circumstance,
 10 there's a word in an act, so you're saying that the word,
 11 employee, in this title of the ADA does not bear the
 12 common law definition?
 13 MR. SEYMOUR: Well, I think the common law
 14 definition is one thing to look at. That is the --
 15 QUESTION: No, no, I'm asking -- they said in
 16 Darden that's the end of it, and you say -- I want to be
 17 just clear about it. You say, it is not the end of it. 
 18 Common law is not the end of it.
 19 MR. SEYMOUR: Yes, that's what we're saying.
 20 QUESTION: All right, and so --
 21 MR. SEYMOUR: Common law is not the end of it.
 22 QUESTION: Okay. Now I understand.
 23 QUESTION: Would -- would you say that the EEOC
 24 guidelines and writings and treatises on the differences
 25 between professional corporations and other corporations

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 might themselves be part of what we call the common law?
 2 I -- I take it part of your position is based on
 3 the proposition that the common law, I suppose of agency,
 4 up through the 1950s just didn't have much on this subject
 5 at all, when we're talking about the difference between
 6 partners and professional and -- and employees of a
 7 professional corporation. There just wasn't a corpus of
 8 writing on that subject.
 9 MR. SEYMOUR: No, there isn't much in the common
 10 law, because a professional corporation is not a product
 11 of the common law, nor is a limited liability partnership,
 12 nor a limited liability company, and all three of those
 13 organizations are virtually functionally identical once
 14 they're up and running. They have the same --
 15 QUESTION: Well, and as -- as courts begin to
 16 write about these things in the area of subchapter S
 17 status, tax status and so forth, there is an emerging
 18 decisional law, at least, that's -- that's evolving, I
 19 take it, and you might say that has some common law
 20 attributes. It might not be common law as we -- as we
 21 usually define it.
 22 MR. SEYMOUR: Attributes, yes, but not that
 23 focus on this particular question, and that is whether a
 24 shareholder-director in a professional corporation should
 25 be considered an employee for purposes of defining who --

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Who -- Darden also says, a couple of
 2 pages after the quote that Justice Breyer -- since the
 3 common law test contains no shorthand formula or magic
 4 phrase that can be applied to find the answer, all of the
 5 incidents of the relationship must be assessed and weighed
 6 with no one factor being decisive, which suggests a more
 7 fluid test, certainly, than the other language.
 8 MR. SEYMOUR: And a more fluid test would be
 9 certainly more flexible, because --
 10 QUESTION: But that's exactly my point. That's
 11 why I started out asking you whether you concede that a
 12 director of a corporation is an employee under the common
 13 law, because if you concede that, you're saying that the
 14 common law fluid test ends up with the director being an
 15 employee, and I take it that it's well-established a
 16 director is an employee.
 17 MR. SEYMOUR: Well, that's -- I -- I understood
 18 your question to be --
 19 QUESTION: No, my question was to try to get the
 20 framework. Either you're saying the common law, you win,
 21 or you're saying, common law, I lose, but I win anyway
 22 because it's not the common law, so if you want to take
 23 the tack, common law test, I still win, explain it to me. 
 24 How is a director ordinarily an employee, but this one
 25 isn't?

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SEYMOUR: Well, under an ordinary
 2 corporation, I think your -- your question would be yes,
 3 but under a professional corporation, it's different.
 4 It's much more like a partnership, because if we
 5 look at the emergence of these new entities like limited
 6 liability partnerships, limited liability corporations,
 7 and professional corporations, they're all emerging for
 8 professional businesses like this clinic from sole
 9 proprietorships or general partnerships, and the only --
 10 there's really no difference, functionally, when we look
 11 at those different entities.
 12 QUESTION: Oh, but isn't there a huge
 13 difference, that they've got limited liability?
 14 If you have -- the corporation is liable if you
 15 have, you're incorporated? Isn't that the true with your
 16 case, too?
 17 MR. SEYMOUR: No, the --
 18 QUESTION: Whereas in partnership, the
 19 individuals are liable?
 20 MR. SEYMOUR: In the partnership, individuals
 21 are liable, but in a professional corporation, in a
 22 limited liability partnership, in a limited liability
 23 company, the -- for professionals, those limited
 24 liabilities are all the same, and they're not as good as a
 25 general corporation, or an ordinary corporation.

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 In other words, the doctors in this clinic, in a
 2 PC, have liability for their own acts, and limited
 3 vicarious liability for the acts of the other doctors. 
 4 That's not true inside an ordinary corporation. It is
 5 true inside a limited liability partnership and a limited
 6 liability company.
 7 QUESTION: Am I wrong in thinking that the --
 8 that the individual liability is not across the board, but
 9 it's only for malpractice-type claims?
 10 MR. SEYMOUR: That's right, it's for
 11 malpractice-type claims, and I think --
 12 QUESTION: So --
 13 MR. SEYMOUR: -- that's pretty much true not
 14 just in --
 15 QUESTION: But other claims against the clinic,
 16 it -- they -- they would have limited liability?
 17 MR. SEYMOUR: Yes, they do, and that's true for
 18 all three of those emerging types of entities,
 19 professional corporations, limited liability partnerships,
 20 and limited liability companies.
 21 QUESTION: Well, maybe there isn't -- there
 22 isn't any settled law, is there, that a limited liability
 23 partnership would not be treated the same way that this
 24 entity is -- is treated?
 25 MR. SEYMOUR: Well, for example, as a partner in

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 a partnership, limited liability partnership, I have
 2 exactly the same limits on my liability as the doctors in
 3 this clinic, and I am not an employee, I'm a partner, and
 4 the only difference between my status and the status of
 5 these doctors is the form of the business, and that's
 6 really just a label.
 7 QUESTION: Well, you say you're not an employee,
 8 but isn't that the question we have to decide?
 9 MR. SEYMOUR: Well, every court that's addressed
 10 the issue of whether partners are employees, including
 11 this Court --
 12 QUESTION: Well, you wouldn't suggest that every
 13 partner -- no partner is ever an employee. You're not
 14 suggesting that, are you? Say you've got a law firm
 15 that's got 250 partners, you're going to say none of them
 16 are -- are employees?
 17 MR. SEYMOUR: I'm sure there are some who would
 18 say that, but I think that what the courts need to do is
 19 look at the individual, not just at a label, and look
 20 beyond the label to find out, as the EEOC standards --
 21 QUESTION: Well, we don't have a partnership
 22 here. We have a professional corporation --
 23 MR. SEYMOUR: Yes.
 24 QUESTION: -- do we not?
 25 MR. SEYMOUR: That's correct.

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: That's what we're talking about. 
 2 We're not talking about partnership.
 3 MR. SEYMOUR: But I'm saying that a -- a limited
 4 liability partnership and a professional corporation
 5 should be treated alike for purposes of the EEOC. Excuse
 6 me, for purposes of --
 7 QUESTION: But then we're away from --
 8 MR. SEYMOUR: Pardon me?
 9 QUESTION: I thought you had a very good case in
 10 your brief, and then I read Darden, and I realized the
 11 reason I was thinking it, I was out of date and thinking
 12 that Hearst was still good law. That's Frankfurter's
 13 opinion on employee. I thought it was a great opinion,
 14 all right, but I can't square that with what the Court
 15 said. That was my initial question, and I'm still there,
 16 because I haven't really heard you explain why it is that
 17 the common law test won't pick up your clients.
 18 MR. SEYMOUR: And I'm -- if I may, the -- the
 19 problem with Darden is, it's examining a different
 20 relationship than we have in this case.
 21 In the Darden case, the issue was whether an
 22 individual was an independent contractor, and we deal with
 23 those issues all the time. Our clients come and say, I
 24 want to be an independent contractor, or make my employees
 25 independent contractors, and we have to go through the

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 books and say, no, we can't let you do that because of
 2 Darden, or whatever.
 3 We don't see those kinds of circumstances in the
 4 law. There's no common law --
 5 QUESTION: Well, maybe the price that has to be
 6 paid for professionals to set up a professional
 7 corporation is to be subject to the ADA, and the anti-
 8 discrimination law of title VII, and so forth, because
 9 these people are going to be counted. In this case, it
 10 makes a difference.
 11 MR. SEYMOUR: Well --
 12 QUESTION: Is that all bad, that they have to be
 13 subject to these provisions?
 14 MR. SEYMOUR: The reason that it's bad -- yes,
 15 it is all bad.
 16 QUESTION: Why?
 17 MR. SEYMOUR: And the reason is that we should
 18 treat similarly situated businesses the same, and there
 19 are a -- a class of partner-like or proprietor-like
 20 individuals, and there is a class of employee-like
 21 individuals, and just because -- let's say it starts out
 22 as a general partnership. Just because they shift into a
 23 limited liability partnership, or a professional
 24 corporation, or a limited liability company, that
 25 shouldn't change who belongs in which class, and if we

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 look beyond the label of professional corporation, then we
 2 can see what the relationships are and therefore settle
 3 that issue.
 4 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for
 5 rebuttal.
 6 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Seymour.
 7 Mr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.
 8 ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN
 9 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
 10 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
 11 MR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it --
 12 may it please the Court:
 13 Under the EEOC's guidance, the question whether
 14 shareholder-directors are employees depends on whether
 15 they operate independently and manage the business or,
 16 instead, are subject to the organization's control. That
 17 standard aligns the test for determining the employment
 18 status of shareholder-directors with the test that courts
 19 have long used in deciding whether partners are employees.
 20 QUESTION: Well, do you say that the EEOC has
 21 adopted standards that differ from the common law, and has
 22 by regulation or otherwise determined that we should apply
 23 its test to this question?
 24 MR. GORNSTEIN: I guess largely, yes. The EEOC
 25 started with the common, common law right to control test

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that is used to distinguish between independent
 2 contractors and employees and adapted it to make a
 3 distinction between those who were the proprietors of the
 4 business and that business' employees, and it did so in a
 5 way to align its standards for looking at the question of
 6 shareholder-director with the same standards that have
 7 been used by all the courts in deciding whether partners
 8 or -- are employees
 9 QUESTION: And do you agree with the
 10 petitioner's attorney that if you look to the common law
 11 test, these people would be employees?
 12 MR. GORNSTEIN: If you look to the Restatement
 13 as the measure of the common law --
 14 QUESTION: Yes.
 15 MR. GORNSTEIN: -- then generally speaking, a --
 16 a director who didn't employ service -- perform services
 17 would not have been an employee, but a director who
 18 performed services would be.
 19 Now, the only hesitation I would have is to say
 20 that the -- that at the time of the Restatement there
 21 wasn't -- there weren't professional corporations that
 22 mixed and matched features of partnership and
 23 corporations, so there's not as clear an answer on that.
 24 QUESTION: Do we owe deference to the EEOC
 25 standard?

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. GORNSTEIN: The -- the Court should give
 2 weight to the -- the EEOC's test because it reflects its
 3 accumulated and longstanding experience in administering
 4 the act, but we're not asking for Chevron deference here.
 5 QUESTION: Didn't the Court say the EEOC doesn't
 6 get such deference? I mean, didn't -- wasn't that way
 7 back in the Gilbert case?
 8 MR. GORNSTEIN: It -- it did say that, that
 9 it -- it doesn't get Chevron deference. Now, there is an
 10 exception now. Under the ADA, the EEOC can issue
 11 regulations, and this Court has held that those
 12 regulations are entitled to Chevron deference, but this is
 13 guidance that applies across the board to all the
 14 nondiscrimination laws, and what the Court has said in
 15 that context is that the EEOC's analysis gets weight, in
 16 light of the fact that it has accumulated experience under
 17 the law.
 18 QUESTION: But it would be kind of a Skidmore
 19 deference.
 20 MR. GORNSTEIN: It would be a Skidmore
 21 deference, that's correct. Now, what --
 22 QUESTION: I hate to be a bore on this, but will
 23 you please write the two sentences for me where I have to
 24 say either that, we apply the common law test, and in this
 25 instance, the common law test comes out in your favor, or

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 we have to say, we don't apply the common law test because
 2 the EE -- this statute is different. Which of those two
 3 paths, both of which could lead to your victory or your
 4 defeat, do you think we should take?
 5 MR. GORNSTEIN: Neither of those two, Justice
 6 Breyer.
 7 QUESTION: Neither, all right. Then write that
 8 section of the opinion.
 9 MR. GORNSTEIN: I -- let me get to Darden,
 10 because I think that's the focus of your questions.
 11 As we read Darden, there is language that is
 12 certainly broad enough in it to say that any time you use
 13 the word, employee, you mean common law employee, but I
 14 think that those, what -- you have to understand Darden in
 15 the context of the -- the issue it was resolving in that
 16 case, and there it was trying to draw a distinction,
 17 whether the term employee embraces independent
 18 contractors, and in that setting, Congress had twice
 19 amended statutes to make clear that the term, employee,
 20 did not mean independent contractor after this Court has
 21 said that it could, and in that context, it makes perfect
 22 sense to start out with a very strong presumption that
 23 when Congress uses the term, employee, it does not mean
 24 independent contractor.
 25 But that's not the situation we have here, and

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 in other cases where the Court has looked at statutes that
 2 use common law terms, like Title VII does with respect to
 3 the term, agent, it has felt a lot more freedom to adjust
 4 that common law term to the purposes of the statute, and I
 5 would point you to the Faragher case and the Kolstadt case
 6 as two examples of that, and that's what the EEOC has done
 7 here.
 8 It has adapted that common law principle in
 9 light of the fact that we have an established tradition in
 10 the courts, well-established, of looking at the question
 11 of partnership in a functional way, does this person
 12 actually operate as a proprietor of the business, or is
 13 this a partner in name only, and it makes perfect sense
 14 for the EEOC to apply that same kind of functional
 15 analysis in deciding whether shareholder-directors are
 16 employees, because for purposes of deciding who should get
 17 the protection of the act, and that's what we're talking
 18 about primarily here, there is no practical difference
 19 between shareholder-directors who run a business and
 20 partners who run a business, and so it makes sense to --
 21 to use the same test.
 22 Applying the same test also makes sense in light
 23 of the purposes of the small business exemption, because
 24 the purpose of that exemption is to spare small businesses
 25 the very substantial burdens of complying with the

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 nondiscrimination laws, and those burdens are experienced
 2 in exactly the same way regardless of whether those who
 3 choose to organize a small business do so through a
 4 partnership form or a corporate form, and the -- the
 5 analysis that the tests should be the same across the
 6 board also makes --
 7 QUESTION: May I ask you a question about the
 8 application of your test? You -- you urge us to remand
 9 the case, as I understand it --
 10 MR. GORNSTEIN: Yes, we do.
 11 QUESTION: -- to answer the question whether
 12 these individuals operate independently and manage and
 13 control the business on the one hand, or are subject to
 14 the organization's control on the other, and I ask you, is
 15 it not possible that the same individual could meet both
 16 halves of that test?
 17 MR. GORNSTEIN: No.
 18 QUESTION: Some of his duties, he'd be manager,
 19 and some others he'd have to respond to what the group
 20 told him to do?
 21 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, it -- it's possible that's
 22 true, but what the EEOC's guidance --
 23 QUESTION: What do you do if you find such a
 24 case?
 25 MR. GORNSTEIN: You make --

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: With respect to surgery, he takes
 2 orders from the directors. With respect to advising
 3 patients, he's on -- on his own.
 4 MR. GORNSTEIN: What -- what we have here under
 5 the EEOC's guidance is, ultimately you make an overall
 6 judgment that's either-or, based on all the considerations
 7 in the guidance, and they are at page 9 of our brief, so
 8 that, just as in the partnership context, you look at all
 9 of these factors, and just as you would in an independent
 10 contractor status kind of situation, you look at all the
 11 relevant factors, and then you make an overall judgment
 12 about, essentially does this person function as a
 13 proprietor of the business, or is he functioning as an
 14 employee of the business overall.
 15 QUESTION: Why isn't it simpler just to say,
 16 well, they picked a corporate form with their eyes open
 17 because it was important for them to be labeled employees,
 18 at least for retirement purposes, so they have to take the
 19 bitter with the sweet. They got that qualification so
 20 they could have their retirement plans, and then it's just
 21 much simpler to say, that's the form that they chose, and
 22 the law for many -- in many contexts does follow what --
 23 the form parties choose for their arrangement. Why
 24 shouldn't that be the answer?
 25 MR. GORNSTEIN: The -- the approach that the

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 EEOC has taken is to -- is a functional approach that
 2 tries to treat all people alike, and to look to the real
 3 functional relationship between the individual and the
 4 employee, and the fact that somebody may have chosen to do
 5 something for tax consequences, or chose to do something
 6 for purposes of limiting individual liability, really
 7 doesn't have anything to do with whether he is the sort of
 8 person who should receive protection under the
 9 nondiscrimination laws, and this is ultimately what we are
 10 determining here, are these shareholder-directors people
 11 who are employees and therefore receive protection under
 12 the nondiscrimination laws, because it's only those people
 13 who are the --
 14 QUESTION: Well, I thought we were looking to
 15 see if some other, lower employee was covered, not these
 16 directors, and that turns on whether you count them as
 17 employees --
 18 MR. GORNSTEIN: That's --
 19 QUESTION: -- or not.
 20 MR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct.
 21 QUESTION: We're not looking to see if they
 22 themselves are covered under the ADA in this case.
 23 MR. GORNSTEIN: But in order to answer the
 24 question you have in front of you, which is, is this a
 25 small business and does this employee get protection, you

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 first have to answer the question of, are these
 2 shareholder-directors employees who get protection under
 3 the law, so that is the inevitable product of having to
 4 decide the small business exemption, is that you have to
 5 decide, these are people who get protection under the
 6 laws, and it -- it's just not the case that the policies
 7 that underlie decisions about incorporation having to do
 8 with tax consequences and individual liability have
 9 anything to do with whether these are the kind of people
 10 who should receive protection under the nondiscrimination
 11 laws.
 12 QUESTION: Well, I just thought Congress was
 13 more concerned with not making really small businesses
 14 covered by these acts, that we weren't focused on whether
 15 these professional shareholders should be covered, but
 16 whether this was the kind of small business that shouldn't
 17 be covered at all.
 18 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well -- I'm sorry, Justice
 19 O'Connor.
 20 QUESTION: Is that right?
 21 MR. GORNSTEIN: I -- what Congress did in the
 22 small business exemption is to link the exemption to the
 23 number of people who receive protection under the laws,
 24 and that makes sense, because it means that at most, when
 25 the small business exemption applies, at most, 14

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 individuals will be excluded who otherwise would have had
 2 protection.
 3 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.
 4 Mr. Crispin, we'll hear from you.
 5 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG A. CRISPIN
 6 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 7 MR. CRISPIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 8 please the Court:
 9 The position of the clinic and the Government in
 10 this case essentially is to look to ignore the form and
 11 structure of the corporate business, yet just 2 years ago,
 12 in Cedric Kushner versus King, this Court held that a sole
 13 shareholder was separate and distinct from the corporate
 14 structure itself, and that's the -- the essence of the
 15 question.
 16 QUESTION: What kind of a legal issue was it
 17 there, Mr. Crispin? What act were we construing?
 18 MR. CRISPIN: That was a RICO question, and the
 19 question was whether or not the two parts of the -- the
 20 RICO enterprise on the one hand and the -- the other
 21 aspect of the RICO question existed with both the
 22 individual sole shareholder and director of the
 23 corporation as being separate and distinct from the
 24 corporation itself, and in that case the Court said, you
 25 cannot collapse the two.

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 The defense position was, they are, in fact, the
 2 same identity, and this Court said no, that's not true. 
 3 What -- the corporate structure is something separate and
 4 distinct, which is recognized by this Court, has been
 5 recognized for years and years and years, and that that is
 6 something that cannot and should not be ignored.
 7 QUESTION: Well, the -- the reason we said it
 8 was that we couldn't find any basis in the statutory
 9 history or the text that -- that gave us a clue that
 10 Congress, in effect, wanted to ignore something which is
 11 such hornbook law.
 12 The argument on the other side, I think, is that
 13 there is a reason to think Congress would want to look
 14 at -- at nontraditional concepts here. The argument is
 15 that the common law definition of employee does not
 16 axiomatically apply because it's not addressing the issue
 17 that Congress was addressing in that -- in this statute. 
 18 The issue that Congress was addressing in this statute, as
 19 I understand the argument, in fact taking the -- the very
 20 words that Mr. Gornstein used a moment ago, was the issue
 21 of protecting people who can be hurt by discrimination. 
 22 It was a protection issue.
 23 So that I think what he's saying, and -- and
 24 what the petitioner's counsel are saying is, the one thing
 25 that we do know about employees is that they were people

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 who were intended to be protected by this statute. If
 2 that is true, it is not probable that they were trying to
 3 include as employees, the protected category, people who
 4 don't need protection because they are in ultimate control
 5 of the business, the ones who, if there's going to be
 6 discrimination, are going to be doing the discriminating,
 7 so it's probable that the people who have that ultimate
 8 control would intend it to be within the employee
 9 category. That's an issue that the common law didn't
 10 address.
 11 How do you respond to that argument?
 12 MR. CRISPIN: Justice Souter, the individuals
 13 that are subject to discrimination in this particular case
 14 are not only the lower-level employees as this case
 15 presents. We have four shareholder-directors, and any one
 16 of those could come down with a disability and have the
 17 remaining three shareholders refuse to accommodate or
 18 otherwise violate the ADA with respect to that one
 19 individual, so the -- the individual --
 20 QUESTION: So you're saying, even on the premise
 21 of their argument, it does not exclude any one of the
 22 four.
 23 MR. CRISPIN: That's correct.
 24 QUESTION: I suppose if one of the four had a
 25 51 percent, a truly indefeasibly controlling interest,

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 you'd concede that, but short of that, which apparently is
 2 not the case here, you say, even if I take their premises,
 3 they lose.
 4 MR. CRISPIN: That's right, Your Honor, I --
 5 although I -- let me comment that I'm not sure I would
 6 concede the 51 percent, all -- I would concede it for your
 7 hypothetical.
 8 QUESTION: Yes, right.
 9 MR. CRISPIN: But our position is that the
 10 employing enterprise is the determining factor.
 11 QUESTION: How -- how does the EEOC treat an
 12 ordinary corporation that, let's say, has 12 regular
 13 employees and then three directors, the cousin, the
 14 father, the son, or whatever, of the owner, so there -- so
 15 it's as -- if you count the three -- and it's a perfectly
 16 ordinary corporation. There's nothing special about it. 
 17 Do they count those three directors, or not, as employees?
 18 MR. CRISPIN: As I read their position, I -- I
 19 believe that they, under the new guidance, would count
 20 those directors under their balancing test. They would
 21 apply the -- this multiple-factor balancing test, look at
 22 the degree of control, and decide on a case-by-case basis.
 23 QUESTION: So remember, these three are just
 24 cousins. They're not -- I mean, they only show up once a
 25 year, and they vote, and -- and that's it. That's their

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 connection.
 2 MR. CRISPIN: Well, in that case, Your Honor --
 3 QUESTION: Do they count them or not?
 4 MR. CRISPIN: In that case, Your Honor, they
 5 would not be counted.
 6 QUESTION: They don't count?
 7 MR. CRISPIN: They don't count, because they're
 8 not performing services --
 9 QUESTION: All right. Then -- and those are
 10 people who the common law really would consider to be
 11 employees, at least while they're there for that hour a
 12 year, is that right?
 13 MR. CRISPIN: I'm not sure what the answer would
 14 be. We know that -- that employee is considered a person
 15 who performs services for the corporation --
 16 QUESTION: Well, they're there once a year for
 17 an hour, and during that time they spill some water,
 18 somebody slips -- I mean, a corporation, I guess, would be
 19 liable, or -- or not?
 20 MR. CRISPIN: On their acts, if they are
 21 performing services --
 22 QUESTION: Yes.
 23 MR. CRISPIN: -- for the corporation for
 24 compensation they would at -- for that hour --
 25 QUESTION: Yes, for that hour.

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. CRISPIN: -- be considered employees.
 2 QUESTION: Right.
 3 MR. CRISPIN: Now, of course, under the ADA
 4 we're looking at numbers of employees over 20 weeks within
 5 a calendar year.
 6 QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
 7 MR. CRISPIN: But again, the idea, as this Court
 8 recognized in Walters versus Metro Educational, was that
 9 the determinations under the employment discrimination
 10 statutes should be subject to ready and easy
 11 determination. Complex and expensive factual inquiries
 12 should be avoided, but yet the Government's test and the
 13 clinic's test, which has adopted the Government's test,
 14 would have this Court look at the facts in each individual
 15 case every time --
 16 QUESTION: Well, don't we have to give some
 17 weight to the EEOC view? Do you just want to ignore it
 18 completely?
 19 MR. CRISPIN: No, Your Honor. The Skidmore
 20 deference is appropriate, Justice O'Connor.
 21 QUESTION: Why? Why, because I would think then
 22 you lose. I mean, here -- if I'm very frank about it,
 23 there are two competing things here, and the one thing,
 24 give weight to the agency, let them define these terms,
 25 particularly at the margin, but that's Hearst, and -- and

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the other is, no, no, it doesn't matter what they say, pay
 2 no attention whatsoever to what they say. What they have
 3 to do is follow the common law definition. That's Darden.
 4 So if Darden applies, I take it you win, but if
 5 Darden doesn't apply, it seems to be much harder for you
 6 to win, because then the agency should get deference under
 7 Skidmore, at least, in applying the term, and the agency
 8 here has a different definition than the one that helps
 9 you.
 10 So that's where I am, and I'm quite uncertain
 11 about it.
 12 MR. CRISPIN: Your Honor, two -- two responses
 13 to your question. Under Darden, it -- it does -- the
 14 Court has decided that the common law applies, and we
 15 would say that's appropriate. The precise test under
 16 Darden dealt with the independent contractor versus
 17 employee test. That is not absolutely translatable here,
 18 but the key concept is that the common law applies is
 19 appropriate.
 20 The second aspect of your question, Your Honor,
 21 was on the deference entitled to the EEOC opinion, and as
 22 I understand Skidmore deference, it's only that deference
 23 which is appropriate under the circumstances of their
 24 test. In this case, the EEOC's test is not workable. It
 25 leads to inconsistent results, and it fails to further

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the -- the interests that are looked at under the statute,
 2 and I can turn to those points.
 3 QUESTION: Doesn't it, perhaps better than the,
 4 just straight common law, of course, deal with the coming
 5 of -- of age, so to speak, of the professional
 6 corporation, which really didn't -- didn't amount to much,
 7 if -- if it even existed 20 or 25 years ago?
 8 MR. CRISPIN: Mr. Chief Justice, it may address
 9 it, but it need not. It need not treat a corporation,
 10 whether it's a professional corporation or a general
 11 corporation, differently --
 12 QUESTION: No, it need not, but it has chosen to
 13 do so, and the -- the question, I guess, before us is,
 14 under Skidmore deference, is that a reasonable decision?
 15 MR. CRISPIN: It's not a reasonable decision in
 16 looking at the professional corporation as the EEOC's test
 17 would apply to it, and -- and the reasons are that, as --
 18 as the EEOC and the clinic has suggested, an important
 19 issue is one of consistency, yet applying their test does
 20 not lead to consistent results.
 21 One can imagine the -- the circumstance of a
 22 professional corporation with one shareholder-director and
 23 14 employees. Under their test, that individual
 24 corporation would not be covered. It has fewer than 15.
 25 Take the situation, though, where there are 14,

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 15 director-shareholders of the professional corporation
 2 and 14 employees, a business nearly twice the size of the
 3 first one, and yet that one would be covered because of
 4 the 15 employees.
 5 QUESTION: Are you -- are you basing your
 6 estimate of what the EEOC would cover on the materials set
 7 forth in the Government's brief at page 9?
 8 MR. CRISPIN: Well, as I -- as I read the test,
 9 what the EEOC would do in that circumstance would look at
 10 the number of employees, and the 15 employees, whether
 11 there was 1 or 14 shareholders would make no difference,
 12 and -- and yet with 15 or 14, or 15 or 25 shareholders,
 13 whether or not they were considered employees or not, the
 14 15 individual employees would be enough to provide
 15 coverage, yet take the same circumstance and back off the
 16 one with the number of employees, and under the EEOC's
 17 test, it would be a factual shareholder-by-shareholder
 18 determination which would be required to determine whether
 19 this company -- corporation is, in fact, covered or not.
 20 And so we have the situations where many more
 21 entities, enterprises with a lot of people working for
 22 them, which may not be covered on the one hand, and down
 23 the street a very similar corporation --
 24 QUESTION: But if they have many people working
 25 for them, they won't be subject to the small business

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 exception.
 2 MR. CRISPIN: That -- that's right, unless they
 3 have less than 15 employees, but yet in a professional
 4 corporation as we have here, the individual shareholders
 5 are performing services for the corporation. In fact,
 6 that's the business of the corporation, is to provide the
 7 medical services that these four shareholders were
 8 performing. They created revenue which came into the
 9 corporation, they got the benefits of the corporate
 10 structure for tax benefits and for ERISA purposes, and yet
 11 they -- and yet the EEOC would -- would put a factual
 12 determination on whether or not one or more of the
 13 individuals were, in fact, employees.
 14 The interest of predictability would be lost in
 15 such a situation. Predictability is important for both
 16 the enterprise itself to know whether it's covered, and
 17 also for the individual employee, the secretary or the
 18 nurse down the hall. In a -- a test that says, we adopt
 19 the corporate structure as the appropriate test, those
 20 individuals, the enterprise, the nurse, the secretary, all
 21 they have to do is look at their paycheck to see if it's a
 22 corporation, and count up the number of people working for
 23 that corporation, performing services --
 24 QUESTION: Well, what -- why would they be doing
 25 this? I mean, are you suggesting that the secretaries

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 won't work for the corporation unless they know it's
 2 covered under this statute?
 3 MR. CRISPIN: I -- I think that's a possibility,
 4 yes.
 5 QUESTION: No, I mean, is it a realistic
 6 possibility? I mean, are people making employment
 7 decisions depending on whether they -- they're going to be
 8 able to sue if there is discrimination likely?
 9 MR. CRISPIN: In -- in my practice, which is
 10 exclusively dealing with employment matters, yes, we see
 11 that, individuals who are quite concerned. Also, I am
 12 aware of, although I cannot cite you to studies which
 13 indicate that fear of retaliation for bringing a claim is
 14 a real factor on individuals. If they know they're not
 15 protected, they don't bring the claim. Now, that's --
 16 QUESTION: But if there are no -- if they're not
 17 protected, they have no claim to make.
 18 MR. CRISPIN: That's true. If they -- if they
 19 know they're not protected, then they -- they don't risk
 20 the kind of retaliation for raising the claim, and they go
 21 on and just do their jobs.
 22 QUESTION: So I'm quite -- still -- I hate to go 
 23 back to this, but it seems to me there might be millions
 24 of small businesses in the country that have about 10 or
 25 12 employees where if you count their directors, they are

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 going to be covered, and if you don't count them, they
 2 won't be, and I'm curious about the practical effect of
 3 that. Of course, if the EEOC counts them now, there's no
 4 problem. If it doesn't count them now, this decision
 5 would -- would affect that. Do you have any sense of what
 6 the facts are?
 7 MR. CRISPIN: I think the numbers are
 8 significant, that there are quite a number of -- of small
 9 businesses in that category, professional corporations,
 10 but whether that's a factor that should enter into the
 11 Court is, of course, your decision, not mine, but if
 12 Congress -- but the -- the touchstone of that question,
 13 then, would be, though, the intent of -- of Congress,
 14 whether Congress intended the term, employee, to have a
 15 common law application and, if that's the case, then they
 16 should be, in fact, covered. That's what Congress wanted
 17 to do.
 18 QUESTION: How do you respond to the famous two
 19 clinic examples, one is set up as a partnership and one is
 20 a professional corporation?
 21 MR. CRISPIN: Well, Your Honor, Number -- I've
 22 got two responses to that. Number 1, it -- it's one
 23 example of a way that it would provide inconsistent
 24 results, but I just talked about a different one which is
 25 very different, which provides inconsistent results by

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 their test.
 2 Second, this Court has never held that a
 3 partnership is not subject to Title VII or ADA because
 4 it's a partnership. Some of the lower courts have done
 5 that, and Justice Powell in his concurring opinion in the
 6 Hishon case did, in fact, address that, but this Court has
 7 never so held. That's not a question that this Court need
 8 address in this opinion, but it is something that the
 9 Court may want to look at in terms of, under the -- for
 10 example, under the Restatement Second of Agency in 1958,
 11 the partnership was recognized as being able to have
 12 employees as members of its partners who were performing
 13 services for that partnership, so --
 14 QUESTION: Are you making a distinction between
 15 owner-directors who are also working every day providing
 16 the services of the entity, and owner-directors who are
 17 not involved in the day-to-day service delivery function
 18 of the enterprise?
 19 MR. CRISPIN: Justice Ginsburg, I -- I
 20 believe -- I believe your question addresses whether those
 21 directors who are not involved day-to-day --
 22 QUESTION: Right.
 23 MR. CRISPIN: -- would be covered as employees,
 24 but the common law test, as I understand it, is that
 25 there's a question of compensation. If the services are

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 being provided, and there's compensation for those
 2 services, then the individual would be counted as an
 3 employee and, as we indicated earlier, the question under
 4 the ADA deals with five work days in 20 different weeks,
 5 so the -- the director who comes in just on occasional
 6 basis, even if compensated, would not be enough to -- to,
 7 typically to add another employee.
 8 QUESTION: Well, if you say the director gets a
 9 fee, and the meetings are not frequent but the director is
 10 expected to remain au courant with what's going on in the
 11 business, so how do we judge that? We can't say, only
 12 the -- for the hour of the meeting that director counts.
 13 MR. CRISPIN: Your Honor, the -- the decision of
 14 this Court in, in the A -- in determining what employees
 15 count for ADA purposes was, the -- the decision was the
 16 payroll method, and looked to the payroll, whether an
 17 individual is on the payroll for 5 days of the week for
 18 20 weeks in the preceding or current calendar year, so the
 19 director, if that director is performing services adequate
 20 to put him or her on the payroll for the entire week,
 21 would be counted as an employee for that particular week.
 22 I -- I would suggest that that would be a rare
 23 occasion where a director who had no other role in the
 24 company but to come in and sit in on a meeting or keep up
 25 with things would appear on the payroll, but if they were,

39

1 then they should be counted as employees, because they are
 2 performing services, receiving compensation, and then it
 3 just simply moves into the -- the method of counting those
 4 employees.
 5 QUESTION: In any event, the director, the
 6 owner-directors, shareholder-directors that we have here
 7 are working for the corporation every day, and they are on
 8 salary?
 9 MR. CRISPIN: They are on salary. They work
 10 every day. The compensation or revenue they produce goes
 11 into the corporation. They enjoy the corporate shield
 12 from liability for all but that small category of exposure
 13 to malpractice cases --
 14 QUESTION: Why is that small, when you're
 15 talking about a professional medical corporation? It
 16 seems to me that that would be the biggest liability, not
 17 the small --
 18 MR. CRISPIN: It very well may be the largest
 19 monetary, but one could -- could list a number of things,
 20 such as liability on the leasehold, liability for employee
 21 claims, liability for employment contracts, liability for
 22 tax payments, that would be the liability of the
 23 corporation, and for which the individual shareholder-
 24 directors would not have --
 25 QUESTION: But with -- with malpractice, don't

1 you have a much greater likelihood of punitive damages and
 2 things like that, that you don't have arising just out of
 3 a contract claim?
 4 MR. CRISPIN: Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice,
 5 that -- that is correct, and so, from the -- the monetary
 6 standpoint, as I said, that would be the greatest problem,
 7 but the -- the idea of limited liability exists in this
 8 corporation, as it does, in fact, in the limited liability
 9 partnerships and limited liability companies, and if the
 10 touchstone is whether there are corporate limited
 11 liability features, then it doesn't make any difference
 12 whatsoever whether we're dealing with a limited liability
 13 partnership, limited liability corporation, a professional
 14 corporation, or a general corporation, individuals would
 15 be employees if they met the requirements otherwise.
 16 If there are no other questions, I'll conclude.
 17 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Crispin.
 18 Mr. Seymour, you have 4 minutes remaining.
 19 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN W. SEYMOUR
 20 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 21 MR. SEYMOUR: Thank you.
 22 The protected class, people in the protected
 23 class should be the same as are counted toward the
 24 15-employee threshold. That is, we should look at the
 25 individuals in the business enterprise the same, whether

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 we are determining whether they are eligible to file a
 2 lawsuit, or are protected by the act, or are counted
 3 towards the act's coverage.
 4 Must these doctors take the bitter with the
 5 sweet? What we're saying is that what these doctors
 6 deserve is to be treated the same as their colleagues in
 7 businesses that are identical, but have a different form. 
 8 That is, these doctors in the professional corporation
 9 should be treated the same as doctors in a limited
 10 liability partnership or a limited liability company.
 11 Would it be simpler to simply look at the form
 12 of the business and stop there? It would, but it would
 13 also be simpler if we looked at the term, partner and
 14 said, well, partners can never be employees, or we look at
 15 the term, independent contractor, and say well,
 16 independent contractors can never be employees, but we
 17 don't do that for good reasons. We look beyond the label,
 18 and I'm suggesting that that is appropriate here as well. 
 19 Look beyond the label and see what the realities are, a
 20 reality check.
 21 Does the EEOC count directors as employees? 
 22 Generally, in -- in business law there's a big difference
 23 between a director, an officer, a shareholder, and an
 24 employee, so as I read the EEOC guidance, that is a
 25 vehicle through which businesses, courts, and the EEOC can

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 look at an individual and determine, well, is the -- is
 2 the label, director, in this circumstance appropriate, or
 3 are they really functioning as an employee?
 4 You can, of course, have inside directors, that
 5 is, employees who are appointed to the board of directors,
 6 or you can have outside directors in some circumstances
 7 where they aren't affiliated except in an advisory role,
 8 as a member of the board, and they -- members of the board
 9 of directors could be paid or they could be not paid, and
 10 I don't think that's an issue that should necessarily be
 11 determinative on deciding whether or not they are an
 12 employee.
 13 The court of appeals here did not look beyond
 14 the fact that the shareholder-directors had organized as a
 15 professional corporation, but the trial court did, and
 16 looked at factors similar to those identified in the EEOC
 17 guidance, and concluded that these shareholder-directors
 18 were not employees. We believe that is the correct
 19 approach the Court should take.
 20 Thank you.
 21 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,
 22 Mr. Seymour. The case is submitted.
 23 (Whereupon, at 11:48 a.m., the case in the
 24 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
