3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 this morning in Case 15274, Whole Woman's Health v.

5 Hellerstadt.

6             Ms. Toti.

7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANIE TOTI

8               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9             MS. TOTI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11             The Texas requirements undermine the careful

12 balance struck in Casey between States' legitimate

13 interests in regulating abortion and women's fundamental

14 liberty to make personal decisions about their

15 pregnancies.  They are unnecessary health regulations

16 that create substantial obstacles to abortion access.

17             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Toti, there is a

18 preliminary question  would you address that  that

19 this claim is precluded.  And let's take first the claim

20 that was in the prior litigation.  Let's assume that

21 they're separate claims, or let's take the admitting

22 privileges.  That was argued and decided.  Why isn't it

23 precluded?

24             MS. TOTI:  Your Honor, it's not precluded

25 because material facts relevant to the claim developed

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 subsequent to entry of judgment in the Abbott case.

4

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you could have

3 amended  you could have asked for supplemental

4 briefing.  I mean, the new action is filed six days

5 after the Supreme Court issues its decision in this

6 case.  You could have asked for supplemental briefing?

7             MS. TOTI:  In Abbott the plaintiffs brought

8 the  the new facts to the attention of the court of

9 appeals.  The court of appeals said that it would only

10 consider evidence in the trial record in rendering its

11 decision, and it held that the evidence in the trial

12 record was speculative, that there wasn't a sufficient

13 basis to conclude that any doctor would be unable to

14 obtain admitting privileges, or that any clinic would be

15 forced to close as a result of the admitting privileges

16 requirement.

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you're asking 

18 you made allegations concerning those same claims.  I

19 mean, is your argument that when you have allegations on

20 a facial challenge and a facial challenge is resolved

21 against you, that all you have to do is come up with new

22 evidence and then you can start over again?

23             MS. TOTI:  No, Your Honor.  The  the 

24 the evidence must be material, and it must be newly

25 developed.  So newly discovered evidence wouldn't be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 sufficient.  If it was evidence that was available at

5

2 the time of the first suit, but the plaintiffs merely

3 hadn't discovered the evidence or didn't bring it

4 forward, that wouldn't provide the basis for a

5 subsequent suit.  But evidence that develops after

6 judgment in the first suit that is material to the

7 claims does provide sufficient basis for a  a

8 second 

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And what's this key new

10 evidence?

11             MS. TOTI:  The  the evidence is the clinic

12 closures that resulted from enforcement  actual

13 enforcement of the admittingprivileges requirement.  So

14 the  the first suit was a preenforcement challenge.

15 It was before the law took effect, and the court

16 concluded that there was not sufficient evidence that

17 any doctor would actually be unable to obtain admitting

18 privileges, or that any clinic would actually close.

19             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, there is very little

20 specific evidence in the record in this case with

21 respect to why any particular clinic closed.  Basically,

22 your argument is that the law took effect, and after

23 that point, there was a decrease in the number of

24 clinics.

25             So suppose you win here, and the State then

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 examines what happened in each of these clinics and

6

2 comes up with evidence showing that in quite a few

3 instances, the closure was due to other factors.  And so

4 then they would  then could they take the position,

5 well, the decision of this Court holding that the law is

6 facially unconstitutional is not binding on us by res

7 judicata, and so you would have to sue them again, and

8 they would be able to make the same argument you're

9 making now.  Is that correct?

10             MS. TOTI:  No, Your Honor.  And 

11             JUSTICE ALITO:  What's the difference?

12             MS. TOTI:  Well, first of all, the State had

13 an opportunity to bring forward evidence in this case

14 about the reasons why 

15             JUSTICE ALITO:  Was it that  was that

16 their burden?

17             MS. TOTI:  No, Your Honor.  Not in the first

18 instance, but the plaintiffs came forward with evidence

19 and  and the State did not offer anything to  to

20 rebut the evidence, which was more than sufficient to

21 support the district court's finding that HB2 was the

22 cause of the clinic closures.

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What  what

24 evidence is that?

25             MS. TOTI:  There are a couple of things,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
7 1 Your Honor.  Prior to HB2, in  in the five years prior 2 to HB2, the number of clinics in the State remained 3 fairly stable.  In any given year, there may have been a 4 one to twoclinic variance.  Following the enactment of 5 HB2, more than 20 clinics closed within a very short 6 period of time.  The timing of the closures  7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What? 8             MS. TOTI:   alone  9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Yeah. 10 What is the evidence in the record that the closures are 11 related to the legislation? 12             MS. TOTI:  The  the  the timing is part 13 of the evidence, Your Honor, and the testimony of the 14 plaintiffs about the reasons why their clinics closed. 15 So that the plaintiffs testified that clinics closed in 16 anticipation of enforcement in some cases, and in some 17 cases because of actual enforcement of the requirements. 18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can we go on to the 19 second piece; that is, the ambulatory surgical centers? 20 That was not part of the last case.  And your position 21 on that is that that is a discrete claim, so it's not 22 barred by a claim preclusion. 23             Is that  is that your position? 24             MS. TOTI:  Yes.  That's correct.  And the 25 claims against the ASC requirement weren't ripe at the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
8 1 time that the Abbott case was filed, because the final 2 implementing regulations for that statutory requirement 3 hadn't yet been adopted. 4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, certainly in the 5 Federal system, and I assume in many States as well, 6 regulations sometimes take years to promulgate.  I don't 7 know of any rule that says we have to wait for regular 8  regulations to be promulgated unless it's something 9 unanticipated.  And the key objections you're making 10 were clear in the statute, anyway. 11             MS. TOTI:  I would disagree that  that the 12 extent of the burden that the law would impose was clear 13 on the face of the statute.  Until those implementing 14 regulations were adopted  and the statute provided a 15 deadline for the adoption of those regulations  until 16 they were adopted, the plaintiffs couldn't have known 17 whether waivers or grandfathering would have been 18 permitted.  And if waivers or grandfathering were 19 permitted, as they have been in every other ASC 20 requirement that's been adopted for abortion providers, 21 the burdens would have been much less, and the 22 plaintiffs would have first attempted to get licensed 23 and seek appropriate waivers before filing their suit. 24 This  25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think you can
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
9 1 separately challenge the admittingprivilege provision 2 and the ASC provision? 3             MS. TOTI:  Yes, Your Honor.  Because 4 those  5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if you can 6 separately challenge them, if you challenge just the 7 admittingprivileges provision, how would you factor 8 in  presumably, you would have to assume that the ASC 9 provision was not under challenge.  So in assessing the 10 burden, you would look at just the admission privilege. 11 And vice versa, if you're challenging just the ASC 12 separately, you'd have to assume you'd assess the burden 13 solely caused by that provision. 14             It seems to me the separation of the two 15 provisions makes  would make your case much harder. 16             MS. TOTI:  I  I would disagree with that, 17 Your Honor, because each of these requirements is 18 extremely burdensome on its own.  The 19 admittingprivileges requirement, which is partially in 20 effect, has been responsible for the closure of nearly 21 half of all the abortion facilities in Texas to date. 22 And the ASC requirement, if it took effect, the 23 Respondents have stipulated that it would close any 24 remaining licensed abortion facility that was able to 25 comply with the admittingprivileges requirement.

1             So independently, each requirement is

10

2 extremely burdensome; and  and collectively, the

3 onetwo punch of these requirements would be responsible

4 for the  the closure of nearly 30 

5             JUSTICE BREYER:  What I think the Chief

6 Justice asked  I don't want to take words out of his

7 mouth  but I think the question was, one of the two

8 lines that's been asked, is that in the district opinion

9 at page 7, the district court has said that if the ASC

10 regulation goes into effect, there will be one facility

11 left in Austin, two in Dallas, one in Fort Worth, two in

12 Houston, and either one or two in San Antonio.  And

13 before that, he said that the enforcement of the

14 appointment privileges, the privileges of admission,

15 would reduce the number from 20 down to about  from 40

16 down to about 20.

17             Now, I think the question was, what evidence

18 did those findings rest upon?  As you've heard, the

19 other side, I think, say there is no such evidence, or

20 the court of appeals said there is no such evidence.

21             So can you give a brief account or page

22 numbers that will show that those findings, the

23 diminishment of the number from about 40 to about eight,

24 which is what the district court found, rested upon some

25 evidence?  What was that evidence?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1             MS. TOTI:  Yes, Your Honor.  So initially, 2 20 clinics closed in the wake of HB2.  Eight closed 3 prior to initial enforcement of the admittingprivileges 4 requirement, and 11 closed on the day that the 5 admittingprivileges requirement first took effect. 6             Respondents quibble with the evidence 7 concerning the first eight.  Even if we  and  and 8 there is basis in the record for the district court to 9 infer that those eight closed for the same reasons as 10 all the others, but even if we  11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where  I'm sorry 12 to interrupt you.  Where in the record is that evidence? 13             MS. TOTI:  Your Honor, I can provide 14 specific pin sites during my rebuttal, but the evidence 15 is in the plaintiffs' testimony about the reasons why 16 their clinics closed. 17             Each of the plaintiffs' class testified that 18 their clinics closed either in anticipation of 19 enforcement of these requirements, knowing that  that 20 the clinic would not be able to continue operating once 21 the requirements took effect, and as a result of that, 22 either they needed to move resources to remaining 23 clinics to ensure that some clinics would continue to 24 operate in the State  25             JUSTICE BREYER:  What'd they say?  Could you
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 give us any record references later or on rebuttal?

12

2             MS. TOTI:  Yes.

3             JUSTICE ALITO:  As to how many, of the total

4 that you claim closed, do you have direct evidence about

5 the reason for the closure?

6             MS. TOTI:  Well, 11 of them, Your Honor,

7 closed on the day that the admitting privileges took

8 effect.

9             JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  And as to how many 

10 how many are you claiming total closed as a result of

11 the law?

12             MS. TOTI:  To  to date, roughly 20 clinics

13 have closed.

14             JUSTICE ALITO:  And of the 20, how  as to

15 how many do you have direct evidence?

16             MS. TOTI:  I  approximately 12, Your

17 Honor, direct evidence.

18             JUSTICE ALITO:  Because if  if you go

19 through this  now we're not talking about a huge

20 number of facilities.  I really don't understand why you

21 could not have put in evidence about each particular

22 clinic and to show why the clinic closed.  And as to

23 some of them, there is  there's information that they

24 closed for reasons that had nothing to do with this law.

25             Now, maybe when you take out all of those,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
13 1 there still would be a substantial number, and enough to 2 make your case.  But I  I don't understand why you 3 didn't put in direct evidence. 4             I mean, I could give you examples:  Planned 5 Parenthood Center for Choice, Bryan, Texas.  Is that one 6 of the ones you're talking about? 7             MS. TOTI:  Yes, Your Honor. 8             JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  There's a news 9 report.  Planned Parenthood and  and the Huffington 10 Post reported that this was closed as a result of the 11 2011 Texas Women's Health Program bill, which cut 12 funding for family planning services.  It's not the law 13 that we're talking about here. 14             MS. TOTI:  Well, Your Honor, that evidence 15 is not in the record. 16             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I understand that. 17 And you put quite a bit of evidence that's not in the 18 record in your brief.  But my point is why is there not 19 direct evidence about particular clinics? 20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said you had direct 21 evidence for 12 clinics and you were going to supply us 22 with that  those record citations later.  That's  23 understood you to say? 24             MS. TOTI:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor. 25 Absolutely.  But I think what's  what's important to
Alderson Reporting Company

1 keep in mind here 

14

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Toti, could I  could I

3 just make sure I understand it, because you said 11 were

4 closed on the day that the admittingprivileges

5 requirement took effect; is that correct?

6             MS. TOTI:  That's correct.

7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And is it right that in the

8 twoweek period that the ASC requirement was in effect,

9 that over a dozen facilities shut their doors, and then

10 when that was stayed, when that was lifted, they

11 reopened again immediately; is that right?

12             MS. TOTI:  That  that is correct, Your

13 Honor.  And  and 

14             JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's almost like the perfect

15 controlled experiment as to the effect of the law, isn't

16 it?  It's like you put the law into effect, 12 clinics

17 closed.  You take the law out of effect, they reopen.

18             MS. TOTI:  That's absolutely correct.  And

19 as the State had stipulated, that's exactly what the

20 State stipulated would  would happen.  And that 

21 that stipulation is certainly direct evidence of  of

22 the impact of the ASC requirement.

23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The  the State, I think,

24 is going to talk about the capacity of the remaining

25 clinics.  Would it be A, proper, and B, helpful, for

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 this Court to remand for further findings on clinic

15

2 capacity?

3             MS. TOTI:  I don't think that's necessary,

4 Your Honor.  I think there is sufficient evidence in the

5 record that we have to support the district court's

6 finding that the remaining clinics, which would number

7 fewer than ten, don't have capacity to meet the

8 statewide demand that 

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There  there have been

10 some changes, like a  a major clinic  I don't quite

11 know the adjective they use for it  in San Antonio.

12 But there  suppose there were evidence that there was

13 a  a capacity and a  and a capability to  to build

14 these kinds of clinics, would that be of importance?

15 And then it would show that this law has an effect, and

16 a beneficial effect so far as the legislature is

17 concerned.

18             MS. TOTI:  If the Court had any doubts about

19 the capacity of the remaining clinics, a remand would

20 certainly provide the Petitioners with  with the

21 opportunity to supplement the evidence already in the

22 record.  But the evidence in the record shows that 

23 supports the district court's finding that because the

24  the ASC requirement, the costs of it are so

25 prohibitive, it will deter new clinics from opening to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 take the place of the ones that closed.

16

2             JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it correct that the

3 number of ambulatory surgical centers performing

4 abortion has increased by 50 percent since this law went

5 into effect?

6             MS. TOTI:  There have  since this law has

7 taken effect, three new ambulatory surgery centers have

8 opened.  And there is evidence about that at the trial,

9 and the trial court knew that that was going to happen.

10 The  the trial court took that into account in  in

11 making its finding.  But nevertheless, there was

12 substantial evidence, including Texas's experience in

13 2003 following enactment of the ASC law for later

14 abortions, for post16week abortions, that shows that

15 the  the market never adjusted and the  the rate at

16 which those procedures occurred in Texas was 

17 drastically diminished following that enforcement of the

18 law.

19             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, one  one quick

20 question about capacity.  I don't want to take your

21 rebuttal time.  But your cocounsel put in  is also

22 litigating a case like this in Louisiana.  And in that

23 case, the plaintiffs were able to put in evidence about

24 the exact number of abortions that were performed in all

25 of the facilities.  Why could that not have been done

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 here?  Why wasn't it done here?

17

2             MS. TOTI:  Well, there  there  so I see

3 that I'm getting into my rebuttal time, Your Honor, but

4 there is evidence in the record about the  the number

5 of abortions that were performed on an annual basis, the

6 geographic distribution of  of those abortions.  Texas

7 collects those statistics, and those  those statistics

8 are  are part of the record in this case.

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You  you had  we have

10 absorbed so much of your time with the threshold

11 question.  Perhaps you can  can she have some time to

12 address the merits?

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why don't  why

14 don't you take an extra five minutes, and we'll be sure

15 to afford you rebuttal time after that?

16             MS. TOTI:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

17             So fundamentally, these laws impose heavy

18 burdens on abortion access that are not medically

19 justified.  And for that reason, they impose an undue

20 burden on the right to abortion.

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you think there's

22 a rational basis for the law based on the benefits that

23 the legislature saw?

24             MS. TOTI:  I do not, Your Honor, because 

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 expressly did not challenge the law as lacking a

18

2 rational basis.

3             MS. TOTI:  We  we did not preserve our

4 rational basis claim.  The  the district court denied

5 that claim, and  and we haven't preserved it here.

6 Here we're focusing on  on the undue burden.  The 

7 we wouldn't concede that the law has a rational basis

8 because in fact, it undermines 

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we have to

10 assume it  we have to assume it does since you're not

11 raising that challenge, don't we?

12             MS. TOTI:  Because the law actually

13 undermines the State's interest in health rather than

14 advancing it by causing an increase in later abortions

15 and selfinduced abortions, we wouldn't concede that

16 it's rationally related to the State's interest in

17 health, but are 

18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said even if the test

19 is undue burden, not rational basis.

20             MS. TOTI:  That  that's correct, Your

21 Honor.  And in order to determine whether a law imposes

22 an undue burden on the abortion right, we must first

23 consider the magnitude of the burden that it imposes,

24 and then compare that burden to what the law is intended

25 to achieve to be 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
19 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't  how is 2 that logical?  I mean, the question is whether there's 3 an undue burden or a substantial obstacle.  What  what 4 difference does it make what the purpose behind the law 5 is in assessing whether the burden is substantial or  6 or undue?  It seems once you get past the  the 7 assumption that the law has a rational basis and you 8 haven't challenged that, then you look at the burden or 9 the obstacle.  And the purpose that the law is directed 10 to, I would think, doesn't make a difference.  It's 11 either a substantial obstacle or an undue burden or it's 12 not. 13             MS. TOTI:  In order to determine whether a 14 burden is undue, Your Honor, we  we have to consider 15 what the burden is in relation to.  In  in Casey, for 16 example, in upholding the informedconsent requirements, 17 the Court first looked to the  the State interests 18 that was being served by those requirements in  in 19 that case, the State's interest in potential life, and 20 concluded that the requirements were reasonably designed 21 to serve that purpose by making the abortion decision 22 more informed and that  23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought the undue 24 burden and substantial obstacle went to whether it was 25 undue in light of the woman's right to exercise her
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 right to an abortion, not with respect to the State

20

2 interest that's asserted.

3             MS. TOTI:  Well, Your Honor, it's  it's

4 both.  Casey sought to balance the State's legitimate

5 interest in regulating abortion with the woman's

6 fundamental right with her  her liberty to access the

7 procedure, and it  it concluded that the State

8 couldn't impose unwarranted burdens.  So where the State

9 had a good reason to impose a restriction and that

10 restriction didn't impose burdens that were undue, then

11 the restriction could stand.  But where a  a

12 restriction is unreasonable or, in  in the language of

13 Casey, "medically unnecessary," and it's going to impose

14 burdens on access to abortion, then  then that

15 restriction cannot be sustained under the Fourteenth

16 Amendment.

17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I walk through the

18 burden a moment?  There's two types of early abortion

19 at  at play here.  The medical abortion, that doesn't

20 involve any hospital procedure.  A doctor prescribes two

21 pills, and the women take the pills at home, correct?

22             MS. TOTI:  Under Texas law, she must take

23 them at the facility, but  but that is otherwise

24 correct.

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  What?  She

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 has to come back two separate days to take them?

21

2             MS. TOTI:  That's correct, yes.

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So now, from

4 when she could take it at home, it's  now she has to

5 travel 200 miles or pay for a hotel to get those two

6 days of treatment?

7             MS. TOTI:  That's correct, Your Honor.

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Let me ask

9 you something about that twoday wait, okay, or  or

10 that travel time.  How many other States and how many

11 other recognized medical people have testified or shown

12 that there is any benefit from taking pills at the

13 facility as opposed to taking the pills at home, as was

14 the case?

15             MS. TOTI:  There  there is  there's

16 absolutely no testimony in  in the record and  and

17 no evidence, you know, in  in any of the amicus briefs

18 that there is a medical benefit to having a medication

19 abortion at a  a multimilliondollar surgical

20 facility.  The American Medical Association and every

21 other mainstream leading medical association to consider

22 these requirements has  has concluded that they are

23 not medically justified for a variety of reasons,

24 including that they impose these onerous burdens on

25 medical abortion, which is the earliest form of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 abortion, and that these burdens are also imposed on

22

2 early surgical abortion, procedures prior to 16 weeks.

3 And as a result, women are going to be delayed later in

4 pregnancy.  And there is evidence in the record that

5 following implementation of the admittingprivileges

6 requirement, in the sixmonth period following, there

7 was an increase in both the number and the proportion of

8 abortions being performed in the second trimester.

9             So by delaying women's access to abortion,

10 these requirements are actually increasing the risks

11 that women face.

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If the Chief may permit

13 me to finish my twopart question?

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The second is the D&C,

16 the dilation and  what's it called?  Dilation and 

17             MS. TOTI:  Curettage.

18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   curettage.  What is

19 the risk factor for a D&C related to abortion and a

20 nonabortion D&C?  D&Cs are performed in offices for

21 lots of other conditions besides abortion.

22             Is there any evidence in the record that

23 shows that there is any medical difference in the two 

24 in the  in the procedures that would necessitate an

25 abortion being in an ACS or not, or are abortions more

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 risky than the regular D&C?

23

2             MS. TOTI:  No, Your Honor.  The evidence in

3 the record shows that the procedures are virtually

4 identical, particularly when D&C is performed to

5 complete a spontaneous miscarriage.  So when a woman

6 miscarries and then follows up with her doctor, the

7 doctor will typically perform a D&C.  And that's 

8 that's virtually identical to an abortion, but it's not

9 subject to the  the requirements of HB2.

10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So your point, I'm

11 taking, is that the two main health reasons show that

12 this law was targeted at abortion only?

13             MS. TOTI:  That's absolutely correct.  Yes,

14 Your Honor.

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there any other 

16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.

18             Is there any other medical condition by

19 taking the pills that are required to be done in

20 hospital, not as a prelude to a procedure in hospital,

21 but an independent, you know  I know there are cancer

22 treatments by pills now.  How many of those are required

23 to be done in front of a doctor?

24             MS. TOTI:  None, Your Honor.  There  there

25 are  are no other medication requirements and no other

2 performed in an ASC.

5         ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.

6           FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

7                SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

8             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and

9 may it please the Court:

10             The effects of the Texas law at issue in

11 this case are much more extreme than those of any

12 abortion law that this Court has considered since Casey.

13             This law closes most abortion facilities in

14 the State, puts extreme stress on the few facilities

15 that remain open, and exponentially increases the

16 obstacles confronting women who seek abortions in the

17 State.  And it does all of that on the basis of a

18 medical justification that cannot withstand any

19 meaningful scrutiny that the American Medical

20 Association has told you is groundless and that the

21 district court found will actually operate in practice

22 to increase health risks to women and not decrease.

23             JUSTICE ALITO:  Is this true of every

24 provision of the  of the ASC law?

25             GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, I  I don't think it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 is true about every provision in the regulations,

25

2 Justice Alito.

3             JUSTICE ALITO:  Not the regulations  yes,

4 in the regulations.

5             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.

6             JUSTICE ALITO:  Every single provision.

7 Then why was the whole thing held to be

8 unconstitutional?

9             GENERAL VERRILLI:  So I  I agree with the

10 premise of Your Honor's question.  There are some parts

11 of the regulation that I think, operating alone,

12 wouldn't have the substantial obstacle effect.  In fact,

13 some parts of the regulation actually restate and

14 reauthorize regulations that were already on the books.

15             And so I suppose one could say that with

16 respect to that set of regulations, that the district

17 court could have severed them under the severability

18 clause.  One could say that.  Of course, they're already

19 in the preexisting regulations 

20             JUSTICE ALITO:  But there are  there are

21 things that go  that go  I haven't checked

22 everything as compared the abortion  the prior

23 abortion clinic licensing law against the ASC

24 requirements, but there are some where there's an

25 increase in what's required.  It seems pretty

Alderson Reporting Company

1 reasonable.

Official

26

2             Under the  under the  the old  the old

3 law, there had to be a nurse, but not necessarily a

4 registered nurse.  Under the new law, there has to be a

5 registered nurse who has a CPR certificate.  So do you

6 think that's unreasonable to say that there has to be a

7 registered nurse who knows how to do CPR?

8             GENERAL VERRILLI:  So I  I don't want to

9 state an opinion one way or the other about that.  But I

10 do want to  what I  but I think  getting to the

11 point of Your Honor's question, I think the problem the

12 district court confronted here, and I think the reason

13 the district court acted reasonably, despite the

14 presence of the severability clause  and the

15 severability clause provides an instruction that  that

16 every provision, every clause, every word, every

17 application, every individual should be severed.

18             And the problem is  the problem with the

19 kind that the Court noted, I think, in the Ayotte case,

20 for a court trying to apply that, the court's got to go

21 in and decide which collection of the many, many

22 requirements there ought to stand and which shouldn't,

23 and it's  it's going to be invading 

24             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it's all 

25             GENERAL VERRILLI:   the State's regulatory

Alderson Reporting Company

1 problems.

Official

27

2             JUSTICE ALITO:  It's work, but maybe the

3 district court should have done that work.

4             I mean, I read through this, and I was

5 surprised.  I read through these regulations.  I was

6 surprised by how many are completely innocuous.  And

7 many of them have nothing to do  they have to do with

8 basic safety.  They don't even have anything to do, in

9 particular, with abortion.  So the entrances to the

10 clinic have to be at grade level.  You have to have an

11 elevator.  The  the corridors have to be wide enough

12 so that you could bring in a stretcher if somebody has

13 to be taken to the hospital.  And  and things of that

14 nature 

15             GENERAL VERRILLI:  So 

16             JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't know why things

17 couldn't have been severed out, if there were some that

18 were 

19             GENERAL VERRILLI: I  I think some could

20 have been, if the Court believes a remand is appropriate

21 for the  for the remedy to be more carefully tailored

22 in the way that the Court did in the Ayotte case.  We

23 think that would be appropriate.  But we do think that

24 the basic point remains that this is a substantial

25 obstacle.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
28 1             And I would like to address two points that 2 arose during Petitioners' argument.  First, closures, 3 and then, capacity. 4             With respect to closures, here's where I 5 think the record will show you taking the ASC 6 requirement first.  The 13  there's a stipulation, JA 7 183, that all  all clinics that weren't already closed 8 as a result of the admittingprivilege requirement 9 would  would not be able to meet the ASC requirements; 10 and therefore, could not  would have to cease 11 operations.  Justice Kagan noted they did cease 12 operation during the  period in which the law was in 13 State.  There's evidence in the record with respect to 14 the seven clinics that are operated by Whole Woman's 15 Health that they  that it was physically impossible to 16 meet the ASC construction requirements because it 17 couldn't fit on the real estate footprint that they had; 18 they couldn't meet them.  There's expert testimony in 19 the record from Dr. LayneFarrar, the economist, that 20 the cost of retrofitting these clinics to meet the 21 requirements would be between 1.6 and 2.3 million 22 dollars, which would be prohibitive; that the cost of 23 building a new facility would be at least 3.5 million 24 dollars, which would be prohibitive; and that the 25 additional operating cost of an ASC would be between
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 600,00 and a million dollars a year more.  So I think 2 with respect to those, there's ample evidence. 3             With respect to the  with respect to the 4 admittingprivileges requirement, we know that 11 of the 5 20 clinics that closed between the date when the law was 6 enacted and the effective date of the 7 admittingprivileges requirement closed on the date that 8 that requirement became effective.  Seems to me the only 9 reasonable inference you can draw with respect to those 10 11 is that that law caused the closure.  With respect to 11 the others, I don't think there's evidence with respect 12 to each one, but with respect to several, there is 13 evidence that they closed in advance of the effective 14 date, because they were otherwise going to have to pay a 15 licensing fee to stay open for another year, which they 16 knew they were not.  And they knew they weren't going to 17 be able to stay open, and they didn't want to flush the 18 money away.  So I think there's ample evidence in the 19 record with respect to causation. 20             Now, with respect to capacity, I really 21 think this is key, because I do think this is the locus 22 of the substantial obstacle problem here.  With respect 23 to capacity, before this law took  took effect, there 24 were approximately 65 to 70,000 abortions a year 25 annually.  The ASC clinics that will be able to remain
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
30 1 open  the ASC facilities that will be able to remain 2 open performed about 14,000 a year.  That's what the 3 record tells you.  It's Dr. Grossman's expert testimony. 4 It's in the JA from pages 225 to 259. 5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  About 20 percent. 6             GENERAL VERRILLI: 20 percent.  So they'd 7 have to increase four or fivefold in a very short 8 period of time with the  against the backdrop of 9 having to meet the problems that the 10 admittingprivileges requirement causes. 11             Now, I understand that the Fifth Circuit 12 said that was ipse dixit, but with all due respect, 13 that's not binding on you and it's just wrong.  And if 14 you look at the expert testimony at the JA pages I 15 identified, you'll see that what Dr. Grossman said first 16 was something that is just common sense, that these 17 clinics aren't going to be  these facilities aren't 18 going to be able to increase by four or five times. 19             And second, he didn't just rely on common 20 sense.  He looked at the period of time between when the 21 admittingprivileges requirement resulted in the closure 22 of 20 clinics.  He looked at that period of time, and he 23 studied the number of abortions that occurred at the 24 remaining ASC facilities during that period of time. 25 And one would expect, given that half the facilities in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the State closed, that there would be a substantial

31

2 increase 

3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you think the district

4 court would have had discretion  the district court

5 having substantial equitable powers that appellate

6 courts don't  to say we're going to stay this

7 requirement for twoandahalf, three years, to see if

8 the capacity problem can be cured.

9             Could a  could a district judge could

10 that?

11             GENERAL VERRILLI: You know, I  I

12 apologize, Justice Kennedy.  I haven't given that

13 question thought, and I'm loathe to opine on that

14 without having given it thought.  But I do think 

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, district judges

16 often think they can do anything.

17             (Laughter.)

18             GENERAL VERRILLI: But  but I do think, as

19 I said, with respect to the capacity problem, the key

20 thing here is that when, in addition to these ASC

21 clinics not providing more abortions once half the

22 clinics in the State closed, you had  and this is,

23 again, in Dr. Grossman's testimony  significant

24 increases in the overall number of abortions,

25 particularly in the parts of the State that were far

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 away from the major cities, the northern 

32

2             JUSTICE ALITO:  There is no evidence 

3 there's no evidence of the actual capacity of these

4 clinics.  And why was that not put in?  Particularly

5 since, if we look at the Louisiana case, we can see that

6 it's very possible to put it in.  And some of the 

7 some of the numbers there are quite  quite amazing.

8 There's one  a doctor there performed 3,000 abortions

9 in a year.

10             So we don't really know what the capacity of

11 these  of these ASC clinics 

12             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think 

13             JUSTICE ALITO:   are.

14             GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think you have expert

15 testimony in that regard.

16             JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  But what is it based

17 on?  It's based  you know, he  it's not based on any

18 hard  any hard statistics.

19             GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, it is.  It's common

20 sense that you can't 

21             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, common sense 

22             GENERAL VERRILLI: But beyond that, as I

23 said, Justice Alito, they studied the period of time in

24 which half the clinics in the State were closed.  And

25 you would expect that those clinics  that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 additional ASCs can handle the  the capacity, they

33

2 would have, and they didn't.

3             JUSTICE ALITO:  He said that  that the

4 number of  the percentage of abortions at the ASCs

5 went down by 4.4 percent, and there was an increased

6 demand for abortion.  But there's no statistic showing

7 that there actually was an increased demand for abortion

8 in Texas.

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought that the Grossman

10 affidavit, which I have  I grant you, it's going on

11 the briefs  but it said at Table  affidavit page 9,

12 Table 2, says that the number of abortions that are, on

13 average, performed annually at the remaining clinics is

14 2,000.  So let's multiply by 2, and you get 16.  Let's

15 multiply by 3; you get 24.  There were 70,000,

16 approximately, women who needed these procedures.

17             So I  I had taken that.  Is it that

18 accurate?

19             GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes.

20             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.

21             GENERAL VERRILLI: In  in the short time I

22 have remaining, I'd like to finish with one point, if I

23 could.

24             I think, ultimately, the question before you

25 is whether the right here is going to retain real

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 substance, and whether the balance  whether the

34

2 balance struck in Casey still holds.

3             If that right still does retain real

4 substance, then this law cannot stand.  The burdens it

5 imposes, the obstacles, are far beyond anything that

6 this Court has countenanced.  And the justification for

7 it is far weaker than anything that this Court has

8 countenanced.  It is an undue burden.  It is the

9 definition of an undue burden.

10             And, Mr. Chief Justice, you  in response

11 to your question, undue means excessive or unwarranted.

12 Could be excessive or unwarranted as compared to the 

13 the obstacle it imposes, certainly.  But also, as

14 compared to its need.

15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would have

16 thought  Casey and Gonzales also said substantial

17 obstacle.  And I would have thought that's something you

18 could look at in an objective manner.  Why  and 

19 actually, I don't understand why you're arguing the

20 opposite.  I think whether it's an obstacle or a burden

21 would exist without regard to the strength of the State

22 interest.  The strength of the State interest, it would

23 seem to me, is evaluated on whatever test there is with

24 respect to that legislation, and then you'd look at what

25 the impact was.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think it's

35

2 actually in the interest of government to look at it the

3 way that we're suggesting it ought to be looked at.  And

4 I  if I  you know, if could take two minutes to

5 explain why.

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.

7             GENERAL VERRILLI: And I think, Mr. Chief

8 Justice, that is because, you know, it is one thing to

9 say that you're going to impose a requirement that does

10 work as much as to be the kind of obstacle that this

11 requirement  that these requirements do, when you have

12 justification that's frankly flimsy and the American

13 Medical Association has told you was groundless.  But

14 if  if the government were able to come in  if it

15 were us or if it were State  were able to come in and

16 say, well, actually, this requirement is going to make a

17 difference in saving hundreds of lives, that might be a

18 burden that you would think would be acceptable, given

19 the medical benefit.  That's why we think the  the

20 test that makes sense, the best understanding of undue

21 burden, the understanding of undue burden that works

22 best for the government is the one we're suggesting.

23             But I think whichever way you look at that,

24 whether you look at it our way or whether you look at it

25 as two separate inquiries, this law, HB2, can't pass it,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
36 1 for the reasons I said.  And I think, therefore, that if 2 you do find that this law is upheld, what you will be 3 saying is that this right really only exists in theory 4 and not in fact, going forward, and that the commitments 5 that this Court made in Casey will not have been kept. 6             Thank you. 7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 8             Mr. Keller. 9             ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A.

All the Texas metropolitan areas 22 that have abortion clinics today will have open clinics 23 if the Court affirms, and that includes the six most 24 populous areas of Texas. 25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, how many women are

Official
1 located over 100 miles from the nearest clinic?

2             MR. KELLER:  Justice Ginsburg, JA 242

3 provides that 25 percent of Texas women of reproductive

4 age are not within 100 miles of an ASC.  But that would

5 not include McAllen that got asapplied relief, and it

6 would not include El Paso, where the Santa Teresa, New

7 Mexico facility is.

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It includes 

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's  that's odd that

10 you point to the New Mexico facility.  New Mexico

11 doesn't have any surgical  ASC requirement, and it

12 doesn't have any admitting requirement.  So if your

13 argument is right, then New Mexico is not an available

14 way out for Texas because Texas says to protect our

15 women, we need these things.  But send them off to

16 Mexico  New Mexico  New Mexico where they don't get

17 it either, no admitting privileges, no ASC.  And that's

18 perfectly all right.

19             Well, if that's all right for the  the

20 women in the El Paso area, why isn't it right for the

21 rest of the women in Texas?

22             MR. KELLER:  The policy set by Texas is that

23 the standard of care for abortion clinics should rise to

24 the level of ASCs for clinics, and admitting privileges

25 for doctors.  Texas obviously can't tell New Mexico how

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to regulate, but the substantial obstacle inquiry

38

2 examines whether there is the ability to make the

3 ultimate decision or elect the procedure.  And when

4 there's 

5             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then why should it count

6 those clinics?

7             MR. KELLER:  Well, here, the evidence in the

8 record showed that this particular clinic was 1 mile

9 across the border that was still in the El Paso

10 metroplex, and women in El Paso often used that facility

11 to obtain abortions.

12             So that would go into the contextual

13 analysis of this particular asapplied challenge.  This

14 doesn't go to the facial challenge, but the asapplied

15 challenge and whether women in El Paso do have access to

16 abortion.

17             In any event, over 90 percent of Texas women

18 of reproductive age live within 150 miles of an open

19 clinic as of today.

20             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Keller, the  the

21 statistics that I gleaned from the record were that

22 900,000 women live further than 150 miles from a

23 provider; 750,000, threequarters of a million, further

24 than 200 miles.  Now, that's as compared to just in

25 2012, where fewer than 100,000 lived over 150 miles, and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
39 1 only 10,000 lived more than 200 miles away.  So we're 2 going from, like, 10,000 to threequarters of a million 3 living more than 200 miles away. 4             MR. KELLER:  Well, Justice Kagan, first of 5 all, I believe the statistics at JA 242, which is their 6 expert testimony, would not account for McAllen or 7 El Paso, but in looking at the fraction of women 8 affected.  And that would be the facial challenge 9 standard, that at a minimum, a large fraction of cases, 10 there would have to be invalidity even if there was an 11 undue burden. 12             The travel distance of  even in Casey, the 13 district court found over 40 percent of Pennsylvania 14 women were going to have to travel at least one hour, 15 sometimes over three hours, and there was a 24hour 16 waiting period.  Texas reduces that waiting period to 17 two hours for traveling over 100 miles.  And in Casey, 18 that was not a facial substantial obstacle. 19             Here, that relevant fraction is  is lower. 20 And under Casey, then the facial challenge would not 21 succeed.  And Petitioners have a heavy burden, and they 22 haven't shown any capacity evidence  23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  When there's a need. 24 Meaning, where are you taking an account in the 25 undueburden analysis the value of the need being  of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 being imposed?  Meaning, even if I grant you that in

40

2 some circumstances travel time is necessary because you

3 just can't get any kind of abortion clinic to go into a

4 particular area, so you might have to impose a burden

5 that might be undue in other circumstances.  Where do we

6 evaluate the benefit of this burden?  What  what's the

7 need?

8             You  you seem  your brief seemed to be

9 telling us that there's no role for the Court to judge

10 whether there's really a health benefit to what you're

11 doing.

12             MR. KELLER:  Well, there would be three

13 elements of the doctrine.  There's the rational basis

14 test 

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not talking about

16 the doctrine.  I'm talking about the question I asked,

17 which is, according to you, the slightest health

18 improvement is enough to impose on hundreds of thousands

19 of women  even assuming I accept your argument, which

20 I don't, necessarily, because it's being challenged 

21 but the slightest benefit is enough to burden the lives

22 of a million women.  That's your point?

23             MR. KELLER:  And what  and what Casey said

24 is the substantial obstacle test examines access to

25 abortion.  Now, if a law had no health benefits,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 presumably it would be irrational.  But even their

41

2 expert  and this is at JA 256 and 258  acknowledged

3 that some doctors do believe that there are benefits for

4 the ASC and admittingprivileges requirement 

5             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What  what is the

6 benefit of the medical, the two pills that you take,

7 what is the benefit of having an ambulatory surgical

8 center to take two pills when there's no  no surgical

9 procedure at all involved?

10             MR. KELLER:  Two responses, Justice

11 Ginsburg.  First, the complication rates are greater.

12 When there's a complication rate from a druginduced

13 abortion, then a surgical abortion is needed as a

14 followup.

15             And the first lawsuit 

16             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  On that complication,

17 that complication is likely to arise near the women's

18 home, much more likely to arise near her home, which the

19 30 miles has nothing to do with.

20             MR. KELLER:  Well, first of all, the two

21 travel distances, that was about the drug protocol.

22 That's a different part of the bill.  That was in the

23 Petitioners' first lawsuit, and they have not raised any

24 challenge to that in this lawsuit.

25             In any event, in 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm not  I'm not

42

2 talking about the prior lawsuit; I'm talking about this

3 lawsuit.  You need to have access to a hospital within

4 30 miles.  30 miles of what?  30 miles of the surgical

5 center when the woman lives at a much greater distance?

6 And if she's going to go to any hospital, it will be in

7 her local community, not near the surgical center.

8             MR. KELLER:  Of course, most abortions are

9 surgical abortions in the State.

10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, I'm asking just

11 about the medical.

12             MR. KELLER:  That's right.  And also 

13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And  and just it's  I

14 can't imagine.  What is the benefit of having a woman

15 take those pills in an ambulatory surgical center when

16 there is no surgery involved?

17             MR. KELLER:  Well, there would be surgery in

18 a complication.  And all abortion clinics in Texas

19 perform surgical abortions, and that's why Petitioners

20 probably didn't defend that aspect of the judgment.

21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If it is a complication,

22 it is not going to occur on the spot.  I mean, you have

23 to concede that in  in the case of the medical

24 abortion, the complication generally arises after the

25 woman is back at home.  And then the nearest hospital

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 has nothing to do with the surgical center.

43

2             MR. KELLER:  Although when the significant

3 majority of women are living within 50 miles of the

4 clinic, in most situations they are going to be in the

5 facility.  And it is beneficial to have continuity of

6 care, to check for clinical competence, to prevent

7 miscommunication and patient abandonment to have the

8 admittingprivileges requirement.

9             In any event, the facial challenge is

10 certainly barred by res judicata.  It was litigated 

11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Before you get  is it 

12 is the underlying premise of  of your argument,

13 Mr. Keller, and of the State's position, that the

14 thrust, the impetus, the effect of this law is to

15 increase surgical abortions as distinct from medical

16 abortions, and that that is within the State's authority

17 to do?  Because my reading indicated that medical

18 abortions are up nationwide but down significantly in

19 Texas.

20             MR. KELLER:  It would certainly be

21 permissible to regulate both surgical and  and

22 druginduced abortions, and in druginduced abortions,

23 since there are greater complications.

24             In the first lawsuit, Fifth Circuit noted

25 expert testimony.  That was a 6 percent rate, which 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I thought an

44

2 underlying theme, or at least an underlying factual

3 demonstration, is that this law has really increased the

4 number of surgical procedures as opposed to medical

5 procedures, and that this may not be medically wise.

6             MR. KELLER:  Yeah.  Insofar as 

7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You might say that this is

8 within the authority of the State to do, but 

9             MR. KELLER:  Given the higher 

10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I want to know what

11 your position is on that.

12             MR. KELLER:  And Justice Kennedy, given the

13 greater complication rates from druginduced abortions,

14 the legislature would be permitted to act in that way.

15             But in any event, Petitioners have not

16 challenged that particular part of the district court's

17 holding that gave them asapplied relief on the

18 druginduced abortion part.  In the Fifth Circuit, they

19 haven't raised that.

20             What they're trying to do on the effects

21 prong is say that the remaining clinics will lack

22 capacity.  But the Fifth Circuit correctly noted that

23 there is no capacity evidence in the record.  They

24 didn't even try to take discovery from the

25 nonPetitioner clinics.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             And indeed, Grossman's ipse dixit was in

45

2 fact ipse dixit.  What he did is he looked at the number

3 of abortions and percentages that were being performed.

4 And a year earlier, ASCs had actually performed more

5 abortions, and so the inference that they were at

6 capacity cannot be drawn.  And 

7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What  what

8 evidence would you have put in on the capacity issue if

9 you had been afforded that opportunity?

10             MR. KELLER:  Well 

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Evidence that would

12 rebut the statistically significant showing on the other

13 side about capacity, and also the circumstantial

14 evidence about the timing of the  of the closures.

15             MR. KELLER:  Well, this is not in the

16 record, but in Petitioners' first lawsuit  this is

17 Exhibit K  to their application to vacate the stay in

18 this Court in the first lawsuit, the Abbott litigation,

19 they went clinic by clinic in a chart  excuse me 

20 and they tried to estimate the number of abortions that

21 could be performed in those facilities.  The district

22 court didn't even make a factfinding there.

23             But the Houston Planned Parenthood ASC they

24 estimated could perform 9,000 abortions annually.

25 9,000.  That's 175 a week is what their chart says.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Before  before the Act? 2             MR. KELLER:  Well, yes, yes, because the 3 Houston Planned  Planned Parenthood operates five of 4 the nine ASCs.  Planned Parenthood is  is not in this 5 lawsuit.  They were in the first lawsuit.  They have 6 complied with the law.  They have doctors with admitting 7 privileges, and they have facilities in each of the five 8 most populous Texas cities. 9             And so if one ASC can perform 9,000 10 abortions annually, and there are going to be at least 11 eight other ASCs in Texas, plus the tenth facility, the 12 McCallen facility, that obtained asapplied relief, it 13 does not stretch credulity to believe that those 14 remaining facilities would suffice to meet the demand 15 for abortions. 16             JUSTICE BREYER:  And you asked to put in 17 this evidence, and then the court said no, we will not 18 let you put in the evidence? 19             MR. KELLER:  We didn't put in the evidence 20 because Petitioners bore the burden  21             JUSTICE BREYER:  I asked, did you ask to put 22 in this evidence? 23             MR. KELLER:  No. 24             JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  Thank you very much. 25 Okay.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
47 1             I'd like to go back to the  the question 2 that Justice Ginsburg was asking, which is about what is 3 the benefit of this procedure. 4             There are two laws.  I am focusing on the 5 first law.  The first law says that a doctor at the 6 abortion clinic must have admitting privileges in a 7 hospital 30 miles within that  nearby, right? 8             MR. KELLER:  Correct. 9             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Prior to that law, 10 the law was that the clinic had to have a working 11 arrangement to transfer such a patient, correct?  I'm 12 just reading it from this. 13             MR. KELLER:  That's correct. 14             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So I want to know, 15 go back in time to the period before the new law was 16 passed, where in the record will I find evidence of 17 women who had complications, who could not get to a 18 hospital, even though there was a working arrangement 19 for admission, but now they could get to a hospital 20 because the doctor himself has to have admitting 21 privileges?  Which were the women?  On what page does it 22 tell me their names, what the complications were, and 23 why that happened? 24             MR. KELLER:  Justice Breyer, that is not in 25 the record.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE BREYER:  But so 

48

2             MR. KELLER:  What I'm 

3             JUSTICE BREYER:   Judge Posner then seems

4 to be correct where he says he could find in the entire

5 nation, in his opinion, only one arguable example of

6 such a thing, and he's not certain that even that one is

7 correct.

8             So what is the benefit to the woman of a

9 procedure that is going to cure a problem of which there

10 is not one single instance in the nation, though perhaps

11 there is one, but not in Texas.

12             (Laughter.)

13             MR. KELLER:  Justice Breyer, the National

14 Abortion Federation previously recommended that women

15 use abortion doctors 

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  I didn't ask that.  I'm

17 sure there are people who had all kinds of reasons that

18 would like to have this and so forth.  And I'm not 

19 I'm just asking you, where we have a judicial duty to

20 say whether this is an undue burden upon the woman who

21 wants the abortion, there are two parts:  Is she

22 burdened and what is the benefit?

23             And now on the first one, I've asked you to

24 give a single example of an instance where there was a

25 benefit, and you say, I think quite honestly, there is

Alderson Reporting Company

1 no such burden.

Official

49

2             So let's turn to the second.  The second

3 one, according to the amicus briefs here, which I guess

4 I could validate, that even without the surgical center,

5 leave it out, there are risks quite correct.  Those

6 risks are roughly the same as the risks that you have in

7 a dentist office when you have some surgery, where you

8 don't have an ambulatory surgical center.  There are 28

9 times less than a risk of a colonoscopy, where you don't

10 have ambulatory surgical center.  There are like

11 hundreds of times less  you've seen these briefs.

12 Okay.  So I read them, and you read them.

13             And so what is the benefit here to giving, I

14 mean, the woman, her risk, I can't say it's zero here,

15 this ambulatory surgical center when the risk is

16 minuscule compared to common procedures that women run

17 every day in other areas without ambulatory surgical

18 centers?

19             MR. KELLER:  That has never been the test

20 under Casey about substantial obstacle.  And this Court

21 in Simopoulos, even before Casey upheld an ASC

22 requirement, and there  Virginia did not require that

23 brain surgery be performed in a hospital or an ASC.

24 That's at 5043 of the Simopoulos oral argument

25 transcript.  It's because in looking at the laws, it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 whether the legislature has a legitimate purpose in

50

2 acting.  Legislatures react 

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's interesting.

4             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, can the legislature

5 say anything, General?  I mean, if the legislature says

6 we have a  a healthrelated abortion regulation here,

7 we've looked around the country and we think that there

8 are ten great hospitals in the country, you know,

9 Massachusetts General, Brigham and Women's, and we're

10 going to make all our abortion facilities conform to the

11 standards of those hospitals, and that will  you know,

12 that will increase medical care.  Now, it's true we

13 don't make anybody else doing any kind  other kind of

14 procedure conform to those standards, but we think it

15 will increase health benefits if abortion facilities

16 conform to them.  Would that be all right?

17             MR. KELLER:  Under this Court's precedent,

18 abortion can be treated differently.  That's Simopoulos.

19 That's Mazurek.  And let's 

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, wait a minute 

21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So every abortion facility

22 has to hit the standards of MGH.  That would be all

23 right?

24             MR. KELLER:  Well, there would have to be

25 medical evidence.  It is at a minimum disputed.  In

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
51 1 here, their experts have conceded that doctors believe 2 this  this is precisely where there's a medical 3 disagreement, even if you don't accept our medical 4 testimony, although it was admitted into the record. 5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sure that there's 6 medical evidence that if every hospital, if every 7 facility was as good as Massachusetts General, they 8 would be better facilities.  I'm sure that you could 9 find doctors to say that, because MGH, it's a great 10 hospital.  But that would be okay, even though it's not 11 applied to any other kind of facility doing any other 12 kind of procedure, even though we know that liposuction 13 is 30 times more dangerous, yet doesn't have the same 14 kinds of requirements. 15             MR. KELLER:  And that was the holding in 16 Simopoulos.  And in Mazurek, the Court  17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, do you think  18 would you put  19             JUSTICE ALITO:  Would it not be the case 20 that  would it not be the case that a State could 21 increase the  the standard of care as high as it wants 22 so long as there's not an  an undue burden on the 23 women seeking abortion?  So, you know, if they could  24 if they could increase the standard of care up to the 25 very highest anywhere in the country and it wouldn't be
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
52 1 a burden on the women, well, that would be a benefit to 2 them.  Would there be anything unconstitutional about 3 that? 4             MR. KELLER:  No.  Provided that women do  5 are able to make the ultimate decision to elect the 6 procedure. 7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But doesn't that show that 8 the undueburden test is weighed against what the 9 State's interest is? 10             MR. KELLER:  Justice Kennedy  11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, are they  are 12 they  are these two completely discrete analytical 13 categories, undue burden, and we don't look at the 14 State's interest? 15             MR. KELLER:  What Casey noted was that the 16 undueburden test is, is there a purpose or an effect of 17 the substantial obstacle to access?  And that's a 18 question about access.  As to whether what the State's 19 interest would be, that would be going to a rational 20 basis review or maybe a purposebased analysis.  But you 21 need the clearest proof under the Court's general 22 doctrine about unconstitutional purpose.  To infer that 23 there is an unconstitutional purpose when there is a 24 legitimate interest in promoting patient health, which 25 is what Texas did here  even Roe v. Wade said that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 States can ensure maximum safety for patients.

53

2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what is the

3 legitimate interest in protecting their health?  What

4 evidence is there that under the prior law, the prior

5 law was not sufficiently protective of the women's

6 health?  As I understand it, this is one of the

7 lowestrisk procedures, and you give a horrible from

8 Pennsylvania, but absolutely nothing from Texas.  As far

9 as we know, this is among the most safe, the least risk

10 procedures, an earlystage abortion.

11             So what was  what was the problem that the

12 legislature was responding to that it needed to improve

13 the facilities for women's health?

14             MR. KELLER:  In Petitioner's first lawsuit,

15 Planned Parenthood admitted that over 210 women annually

16 are hospitalized because of abortion complications.

17 Here at JA 266 

18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  As compared to

19 childbirth, many, many  much riskier procedure, is it

20 not?

21             MR. KELLER:  Well, the American Center for

22 Law and Justice and Former Abortion Providers' amicus

23 briefs dispute that.  But regardless, there is

24 evidence 

25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there really any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 dispute that childbirth 

54

2             (Laughter.)

3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   is a much riskier

4 procedure than an early stage abortion?

5             MR. KELLER:  Justice Ginsburg, those amicus

6 briefs point out what when you look at record linkage

7 statistic, instead of complication reporting, there may

8 be a difference.  And the reason why reporting is

9 important is there's evidence in the record here that

10 abortion complications are underreported.  That's at JA

11 844 and 870 to 72.  In fact, Petitioner.

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  By hospitals?

13 Underreported  most of the complications you're

14 talking about were reported at hospitals, correct?

15             Yes, there is some evidence of not reporting

16 other things outside the hospital, but you know the

17 number of  hospitals are accurately reporting.

18             MR. KELLER:  Well, abortion clinics are

24 606700, Petitioner Whole Woman's Health 

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the percentage of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 210 from 70,000?  My math is pretty horrible.  It's


55

2
 pretty small.

3             MR. KELLER:  And  and the statistic at JA

4 266 is it is lower than 1 percent.  However, when there

5 are two to three women 

6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't mean to  to

7 negate that one should try to avoid injury to anyone,

8 and  and don't take my question as that, but there are

9 people who die from complications from aspirin.  May be

10 unusual, but there's a certain percentage that do that.

11 Yet, we don't require that people take aspirins in ASC

12 centers or in hospitals.

13             MR. KELLER:  But in examining 

14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There has to be some tie

15 between the benefit and the burden, doesn't there?

16             MR. KELLER:  In examining not effect, but

17 the purpose.  The constitutional analysis would be did

18 the Texas legislature have an invalid purpose?  And if

19 you 

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, don't you think

21 that you can read that from the fact that there are so

22 many other medical treatments whose complication rates

23 are so disproportionately higher, and the legislature is

24 only targeting abortion when there is nothing about the

25 figures before it that show a risk so unusual that it

Alderson Reporting Company

1 needs greater attention?

56

2             MR. KELLER:  But that would have been

3 Simopoulos; it would have been Mazurek.  And this is why

4 Petitioners are trying to upset the balance that was

5 struck in Casey.

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't see where this fits

7 in, I mean, to the argument.  I  I don't question

8 their purpose.  I won't question their purpose.

9             MR. KELLER:  Good.  Thank you, Justice

10 Breyer.

11             (Laughter.)

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  But the  the  what

13 their purpose is, that they're worried about these

14 complications and they want to make life safer for the

15 women.  All right?  Let's take that as the purpose.

16             You said there aren't very many

17 complications.  Now, would you say if you reduce the

18 number of clinics, as has been argued  maybe it isn't

19 exactly that, but that  and you  you suddenly have

20 at least 10,000  maybe a few less, and maybe a few

21 more  women who have to travel 150 miles to get their

22 abortion  maybe more, maybe stay overnight, maybe try

23 to scrape together the money, you understand the

24 argument  are there going to be more women or fewer

25 women who die of complications due to an effort to

Alderson Reporting Company

1 create an abortion?

Official

57

2             I mean, you read the briefs, and you've read

3 the same articles I have.  And of course the argument is

4 if you lead to selfinduced abortion, you will find many

5 more women dying.  So if the concern is this tiny risk

6 of dying through a complication in a clinic, is this a

7 remedy that will in fact achieve the legislature's

8 healthsaving purpose?

9             MR. KELLER:  Justice Breyer, about

10 selfinduced abortion, the evidence in the record on

11 that were two points of testimony, both from McAllen

12 where Petitioners prevailed, asapplied challenges could

13 be brought in areas  for instance, if there could be

14 shown a substantial obstacle based on travel distance,

15 the four clinics that closed in West Texas between El

16 Paso and San Antonio, all those closed before the

17 admittingprivileges requirement took effect.  They were

18 all Planned Parenthood facilities.

19             In Petitioners' first 

20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Keller  Keller 

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'd like to hear what he

22 says.

23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Asapplied challenge is a

24 real problem with that, because suppose you bring in

25 that asapplied challenge and you're successful.  You

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
58 1 can't have a creation of an ambulatory surgical center 2 on the spot. 3             I mean, these  these  once  once these 4 facilities are closed, they're closed, and they can't 5 start up tomorrow.  So how  the asapplied 6 challenge  I mean, the woman's problem would be long 7 over before this clinic, the kind of clinic they had 8 before, could be restarted. 9             MR. KELLER:  Justice Ginsburg, the McAllen 10 clinic reopened, and as Justice Kagan mentioned, clinics 11 did reopen.  The Lubbock facility, though, which is one 12 of the facilities in West Texas, in Petitioners' first 13 lawsuit they told this Court in their application that 14 that clinic was going to close regardless. 15             And seven of the eight clinics that closed 16 before the admittingprivileges requirement took effect, 17 and went from 41 to 33, seven of those eight were 18 Planned Parenthood clinics.  Planned Parenthood is 19 complying with the law and providing that increased 20 standard of care. 21             And also, the eleven clinics that closed the 22 day that the admittingprivileges requirement took 23 effect, when it went from 33 to 22, I don't believe six 24 of those clinics can be deemed to have ceased performing 25 abortions because of that requirement.  The Lubbock
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 facility was going to close anyway.  Killeen had

59

2 admitting privileges.  That's JA 401.

3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There was a

4 stipulation  there was a stipulation that is "No

5 currentlylicensed abortion facility meets the ASC

6 requirements.  Each will be prohibited from performing

7 abortions after the day the law goes into effect."

8 That's a stipulation, not a question of what evidence

9 there was for.

10             Texas stipulated that no currentlylicensed

11 facility meets ASC requirements, and each will be

12 prohibited from performing abortions.

13             MR. KELLER:  And that would go to the ASC

14 requirement as opposed to the facial challenge of the

15 admittingprivileges requirement.  But four of the

16 facilities that reopened  four facilities reopened of

17 those eleven when the admittingprivileges requirement

18 went into effect.  That was Dallas, two at Ft. Worth,

19 one in Austin.  That's JA 131, 715, 1111 and 1436.  Two

20 of those were ASCs.

21             Now, when it comes to the count of ASCs,

22 there are nine ASCs performing abortion today in Texas.

23 Three opened up after House Bill 2 was passed.  So in

24 examining the facial challenge to that requirement, when

25 ASCs exist 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
60 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I ask:  Were they 2 opened as a result of the law, or were they planned to 3 be opened before the law went into effect?  Because I 4 think that makes a difference to me if they were planned 5 to be opened.  It takes quite a while to dig up the 6 money, get the investors, buy the land, do the building. 7 It seems to me that they must have been planned for a 8 while.  And if they were, it was because there was a 9 need independent of the number of abortions. 10             MR. KELLER:  Well  11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In other words, it's 12 fortuitous that they've come into existence, but it was 13 in  their need was not there  was independent of the 14 reduced number of facilities elsewhere. 15             MR. KELLER:  Legislature provided 13 months 16 to come into compliance.  In addition, you could lease 17 space.  Texas has over 430  there are 433 general ASCs 18 in Texas at the time of trial. 19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But most of them don't 20 choose to provide abortions. 21             MR. KELLER:  That's correct.  Of course, 22 space could be leased in those. 23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what you don't know 24 is what  do you have enough resources to open up an 25 ASC if you're going to do abortions?  Are you going to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 get enough developers to  to invest in your work?

61

2             MR. KELLER:  Yeah.  The point being that

3 there are going to be at least ten clinics 

4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I ask about McAllen?

5 There was testimony in the record that at least four

6 doctors had  from that spot had asked for admitting

7 privileges.  Well, the Fifth Circuit's remedy only

8 provided for one doctor, Dr. Lynn, who's past retirement

9 age, to be the only doctor performing abortions in that

10 clinic.

11             Now, if the clinic had  I don't know how

12 many it had, but it had at least four people before 

13 it seems rather callous to say as a remedy that we're

14 going to make that one doctor do the work of four, or

15 maybe more doctors who didn't get admitting privileges.

16 Why is even the Fifth Circuit's remedy reasonable?

17             MR. KELLER:  Because, Justice Sotomayor,

18 that was the only named plaintiff for the asapplied 

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that  but  if 

20 yes.  As applied, the A  ASC law is affecting this

21 clinic because it can't get its doctors certified.  So

22 why does it require a named plaintiff to relieve that

23 clinic of the obligation of going without admitting

24 privileges?

25             MR. KELLER:  Well, that wasn't the only one

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
62 1 of the four doctors that joined this lawsuit, because 2 most of the doctors and clinics in Texas are not part of 3 this lawsuit  4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you just lift the 5 requirement because you know that it's the only clinic 6 in the area. 7             MR. KELLER:  Well  8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if any doctor who's 9 licensed appropriately can get admitting privileges, 10 they should be permitted to work in that clinic. 11             Why does Dr. Lynn have to become an 12 indentured slave to ensure that women in her area are 13 provided with their fundamental right to choose? 14             MR. KELLER:  Justice Sotomayor, it would not 15 be an indentured situation.  If there were new facts 16 that came into being that that doctor  17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But she wants to 18 leave  19             MR.

Counsel  23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, could  could I 24 ask  could I go back to a question that  something 25 that you said earlier?  And tell me if I'm misquoting
Alderson Reporting Company

1 you.  You said that as the law is now, under your

63

2 interpretation of it, Texas is allowed to set much, much

3 higher medical standards, whether it has to do with the

4 personnel or procedures or the facilities themselves,

5 higher medical standards, including much higher medical

6 standards for abortion facilities than for facilities

7 that do any other kind of medical work, even much more

8 risky medical work.  And you said that that was your

9 understanding of the law; am I right?

10             MR. KELLER:  Correct, in this Court's  in

11 Simopoulos.

12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And I guess I just want to

13 know why would Texas do that?

14             (Laughter.)

15             MR. KELLER:  When there are complications

16 from abortion that's in the record, Texas can enact laws

17 to promote safety.

18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, I know, but  but the

19 assumption of the question, and I think you haven't

20 challenged this assumption, is that there are many

21 procedures that are much higher risk:  Colonoscopies,

22 liposuctions, we could go on and on.  And  and you're

23 saying, that's okay, we get to set much higher standards

24 for abortion.  And I just want to know why that is.

25             MR. KELLER:  Justice Kagan, this bill was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
64 1 passed in the wake of the Kermit Gosnell scandal that 2 prompted Texas and many other States to reexamine their 3 abortion regulations. 4             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, of course, the  I 5 mean, Texas's own regulations actually have made 6 abortion facilities such that that can never happen, 7 because you have continual inspections, I mean, to your 8 credit.  So that was really not a problem in Texas, 9 having a kind of rogue outfit there.  Texas has taken 10 actions to prevent that. 11             So, again, I just sort of  I'm left 12 wondering, given this baseline of regulation that 13 prevents rogue outfits of  like that, why it is that 14 Texas would make this choice.  And you say you're 15 allowed to make this choice, and we can argue about 16 that.  I just want to know why Texas would make it. 17             MR. KELLER:  I think the amicus brief for 18 the 121 Texas legislators that canvasses the medical 19 evidence and canvasses statements confirms that that  20 that there were complications that these laws do have 21 benefits.  And even the bill opponents said  22             JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't it true  23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Are you  are you in  24 you're not really contesting that there are greater 25 complications in abortion facilities than there are with
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
65 1 a great deal of medical procedures that do  that are 2 not subject to the same standard of regulation. 3             MR. KELLER:  Yeah, brain surgery, for 4 instance, just like Simopoulos, would almost certainly 5 have  it  it would have higher risk of complication. 6 But the point is to  7             JUSTICE ALITO:  General, as to  as to 8 rogue facilities, which Justice Kagan just mentioned, 9 one of the amicus briefs cites instance after instance 10 where Whole Woman's facilities have been cited for 11 really appalling violations when they were inspected: 12 Holes in the floor where  where rats could come in, 13 the lack of any equipment to adequately sterilize 14 instruments.  Is that not the case? 15             MR. KELLER:  Stories similar to that are 16 also raised in the 121 Texas legislators' amicus briefs. 17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But, I'm sorry  18             JUSTICE ALITO:  These are not stories  19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito. 20             JUSTICE ALITO:  These are, as I understand 21 it, actual reports of  of inspections of those 22 facilities. 23             MR. KELLER:  The amicus briefs do discuss 24 that, and the complications from Whole Woman's Health 25 were underreported to the State.  That's JA 606 to 700.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
66 1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Random  Texas, under 2 the prior law, has the right to make random inspections. 3 Was  the problem in Pennsylvania was this filthy 4 clinic hadn't been looked at by anyone from the State in 5 16 years.  But Texas can go into any one of these 6 clinics and immediate  immediately spots a violation? 7 It says you can't operate till you come up to speed. 8             So Texas has had, as Justice Kagan pointed 9 out, its own mechanism for preventing that kind of thing 10 from happening. 11             MR. KELLER:  Texas did have existing 12 regulations, but increasing the standard of care is 13 valid, particularly not only in light of  14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's valid only if it's 15 taking care of a real problem. 16             MR. KELLER:  And there were  the  17 abortion complications and underreported questions  18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, no, no, no.  A 19 real problem, meaning, Gosnell, the governor of 20 Pennsylvania, said was a regulatory failure.  And only 21 in that, not  this clinic had not been inspected for 22 15 years.  He  the doctor was fabricating his reports. 23 That could happen almost in any setting.  Anyone who 24 intends to break the law is going to break the law, 25 whatever the regulatory rules are.

67 1             You're going to have doctors, as happened 2 pre our laws, who were performing abortions without 3 permission in their offices or without licenses.  And I 4 don't want to suggest that we should presume that's 5 going to happen, but it will happen. 6             MR. KELLER:  The constitutional standard for 7 whether a State can make abortion safer can't be that it 8 can only prevent the Gosnell situation, and there are 9 complications. 10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but  yeah, 11 but  but you have to see, as Justice Breyer asked you 12 earlier, why are the problems?  Isn't this a 13 selfcreated problem?  What happened in Texas 14 independent of Gosnell that raised the Gosnelllike 15 situation in Texas that made  16             JUSTICE ALITO:  Gosnell. 17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   the legislature so 18 concerned after so many years about taking care of this 19 greater risk in abortions, as opposed to all the other 20 procedures that are performed in nonASC facilities? 21             MR. KELLER:  Because there are complications 22 in abortion, and this was a top  23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But there's 24 complications in colonoscopies, and colonoscopies are, 25 what, 15 times

3 corrected me.

4             (Laughter.)

5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  28 percent higher.  I

6 mean 

7             MR. KELLER:  But legislatures react to

8 topics that are of public concern.  In Gonzales, the

9 Court noted after Dr. Haskell's procedure for partial

10 birth abortion became more of a nationwide concern,

11 States reacted.  When the legislature sees that there's

12 a problem, and maybe that there wouldn't rise to the

13 same level of a Gosnell problem, but the legislature can

14 still act to make abortion safer, which is precisely

15 what Texas did here.

16             If I can address my friend's contention of

17 the record as to what clinics closed preemptively.

18 There is evidence in the record that Killeen, McCallen

19 and El Paso, three clinics, closed preemptively.  They

20 brought asapplied challenges in McCallen and prevailed.

21 They brought their asapplied challenge in El Paso and

22 did not prevail.  And the Killeen clinic did not seek

23 asapplied relief.

24             Indeed, if there are any future concerns,

25 asapplied challenges can be raised.  For instance, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
69 1 wide swath of area in West Texas that does not have an 2 abortion clinic today, there was no asapplied relief 3 sought in this case.  And if there were  if it would 4 turn out that there were going to be an issue in that 5 area, a future asapplied challenge could address that 6 concern. 7             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, that's the problem. 8 Once a clinic closes  you said McCallen reopened, but 9 that was very swift.  Once a clinic closes, equipment 10 are gone, the doctors are gone, you can't reinstate it 11 tomorrow.  It won't be there.  There will be no remedy 12 for that woman who succeeds in the asapplied challenge. 13             MR. KELLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, my time has 14 expired, if may address it. 15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure. 16             MR. KELLER:  Except even there, the clinic 17 was not just closed for a single day.  It was closed for 18 a longer period of time.  And there was an El Paso 19 clinic that actually reopened also months later.  So an 20 asapplied challenge could allow a clinic, if an undue 21 burden, if a substantial obstacle were shown because of 22 driving distances or capacity in the future, in that 23 discrete instance, but we're in this facial challenge 24 posture, Petitioners bear the heavy burden to show at 25 least a large

5 Texas, it's as big as California.  No?  Bigger?

6             MR. KELLER:  I'm not sure about California,

9             MR. KELLER:  Absolutely.

10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why isn't it

11 selfevident if you have a law that says you can only be

12 an ACS provider, and who's going to come in and say, I

13 can't be an ACS provider, but it's an undue burden on

14 me, or it's an undue burden that's selfevident on the

15 women in that area?

16             MR. KELLER:  Well, the right is possessed by

17 the women.  The clinics and doctors can bring

18 challenges.

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.  So why don't

20 we take this lawsuit as those women saying just that?

21             MR. KELLER:  Because there was no 

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You can't have a law

23 that has marginal, if any, medical benefit be applied to

24 this procedure anywhere where there's an undue burden on

25 people  on women.

Alderson Reporting Company

1             MR. KELLER:  Planned Parenthood had four

71

2 clinics in West Texas.  They all closed before any part

3 of HB2 was actually put into effect.  They could have

4 brought an asapplied challenge.  They didn't.  Planned

5 Parenthood did not join this lawsuit.  They were part of

6 the first lawsuit.  And indeed, the facial challenges

7 here are barred by res judicata and there are

8 significant record gaps.

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I ask you one

10 question?  You earlier in your argument, you were

11 quoting how many women are within a reasonable range of

12 the clinic.  But don't we know from Casey that the focus

13 must be on the ones who are burdened and not the ones

14 who aren't burdened?  There  there is  and the

15 district court said, you know, this is not a problem for

16 women who have means to travel, that those women will

17 have access to abortion, anyway.  So  in Texas or out

18 of Texas.

19             So Casey was quite precise in this, when

20 it's talking about husbands and notification.  You don't

21 look to all the women who are getting abortions.  You

22 look only to the  to the  the women for whom this is

23 a problem.  And so the only women we would be looking at

24 is not all of the women who are  who live in Austin or

25 in Dallas, but the women who have the problem who don't

6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   exception?

7             MR. KELLER:  When a law is regulating women,

8 as it would in the spousalnotification provision, that

9 might be different.  But when we're talking about doctor

10 and clinic regulations, when the law is going to have a

11 relevant effect, is going to be for every doctor and

12 every clinic, which is precisely why the Fifth Circuit

13 noted that that was the proper denominator, all women of

14 Texas reproductive age.  And Petitioners have not

15 challenged that denominator holding in their opening

16 brief.

17             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this is about  what

18 it's about is that a woman has a fundamental right to

19 make this choice for herself.  That's what we sought as

20 the starting premise.  And then this is certainly

21 about  Casey  Casey made that plain, that it  the

22 focus is on the woman, and it has to be on the segment

23 of women who are affected.

24             MR. KELLER:  Yes.  And  and the right held

25 by women to make that ultimate decision is not burdened

73 1 in, at a minimum, a large fraction of cases in Texas, 2 when each metropolitan area will still have a clinic, 3 even after the law goes into effect, and future 4 asapplied challenges could address any possible 5 concerns about West Texas or otherwise. 6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 7             MR. KELLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Toti, you have 9 five minutes remaining. 10            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANIE TOTI 11               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 12             MS. TOTI:  Thank you. 13             A few brief points.  First, the record cites 14 from earlier evidence that HB2 caused clinics to close 15 in Texas.  The plaintiffs testified that HB2 caused 16 clinics in Killeen, Austin, Beaumont, McAllen, and El 17 Paso to close, and that testimony is at JA 339, 715, 722 18 and 731. 19             Respondents stipulated at JA 183 and 184 20 that the ASC requirement would cause any licensed 21 abortion facility still operating on the day it took 22 effect to close. 23             Plaintiffs' Exhibit 28 at page 2, which is 24 not in the Joint Appendix but was admitted in the record 25 at 2808 and 09, demonstrates that for the five years
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
74 1 prior to the enactment of HB2, the number of abortion 2 clinics in Texas remained fairly constant. 3             And finally, at JA 229 and 1430, there is  4 at 229, testimony from Dr. Grossman, and at 439, our 5 response to the Fifth Circuit's directive showing that 6 11 clinics closed on the day that the 7 admittingprivileges requirement was  8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And that  that's 9 the  the last evidence was from Dr. Grossman? 10             MS. TOTI:  JA 229 is from Dr. Grossman's. 11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  At page 232, he 12 said, "I am not here offering any opinion on the cause 13 of the decline in the number of abortion facilities." 14             MS. TOTI:  That's correct.  Dr. Grossman did 15 not offer an opinion on that.  But his testimony 16 supplies the fact, from which the district court drew 17 the inference, that 11 clinics closed on the day that 18 the State first enforced the admittingprivileges 19 requirement.  The district court referred from that fact 20 that enforcement was the cause of the closure, and 21 Respondents offered no alternative explanation for why 22 there would be such a precipitous drop in the number of 23 abortion  24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you tell me why 25 Planned Parenthood left the western area?  The General
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
75 1 says that Planned Parenthood  that ASC and the  and 2 the admitting privileges had nothing to do with the 3 closures in the western area of Texas. 4             MS. TOTI:  Well, the  the two clinics in 5 El Paso, which is in  in  in that western region of 6 Texas that would be forced to close as a result of these 7 requirements, are not operated by Planned Parenthood. 8 Planned Parenthood doesn't have any clinics in Texas. 9 The plaintiff in this case and another independent 10 provider operate those clinics. 11             JUSTICE ALITO:  And as to the  the clinics 12 where there is direct evidence, does the direct evidence 13 show whether the cause was the admittingprivileges 14 requirement or the ASC requirement or both? 15             MS. TOTI:  It  it  with respect to  it 16 does specify.  And some specify the admittingprivileges 17 requirement, and some specify the ASC requirement.  And 18 some specify both. 19             So with respect to whether abortion can be 20 regulated differently than other medical procedures, 21 abortion can certainly be treated differently, if there 22 is a reason to treat it differently.  But Texas may not 23 impose unnecessary medical regulations that burden 24 women's access to abortion. 25             In Simopoulos, the Court found that the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
76 1 regulations of secondtrimester procedures at issue in 2 that case were consistent with prevailing medical 3 standards at the time, and that was critical to the 4 court's decision. 5             That is not the case here.  There is 6 extensive testimony in the record that these 7 requirements are not medically justified.  They are not 8 consistent with prevailing medical standards, and their 9 amicus briefs from leading medical associations, 10 including the AMA and ACOG, confirming that. 11             JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that Federal 12 district judges or this Court is well qualified to 13 determine whether there is a different risk, regard  14 with respect to abortion, as compared to other 15 procedures, that may or may not have to be required  16 may or may not have to be performed in an  in an ASC? 17             MS. TOTI:  Your Honor, district courts are 18 quite competent to determine the credibility and the 19 reliability of expert testimony.  That's something 20 that's within the core competence of a trial court.  And 21 the trial court in this case determined that there was 22 no credible or reliable evidence supporting Texas's 23 contentions about the medical justification for these 24 laws. 25             And, further, had Texas truly believed that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 these laws provided some important benefit for

77

2 outpatient surgery, it would have made them generally

3 applicable.

4             All outpatient surgical providers would have

5 to have admitting privileges or practice in an ASC, but

6 that's not the case.

7             Texas law expressly authorizes other

8 surgical procedures, including those performed under

9 general anesthesia  which early abortion is not  to

10 be performed in the physician's office.  And even other

11 physicians that operate at an ASC aren't required to

12 have admitting privileges.  The facility is merely

13 required to have a transfer agreement.  So these

14 regulations target one of the safest procedures that a

15 patient can have in an outpatient setting for the most

16 onerous regulations.

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

18             MS. TOTI:  Thank you.

19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The case is

20 submitted.

21             (Whereupon, at 11:28 a.m., the case in the

22 aboveentitled matter was submitted.)
