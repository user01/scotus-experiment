1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 4 argument first this morning in Case 08-1371, Christian 5 Legal Society Chapter of the University of California6 Hastings v. Martinez. 7 Mr. McConnell. 8 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL 9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 10 MR. McCONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 11 it please the Court: 12 If Hastings is correct, a student who does 13 not even believe in the Bible is entitled to demand to 14 lead a Christian Bible study, and if CLS does not 15 promise to allow this, the college will bar them from its 16 forum for speech. 17 The First Amendment -- under the First 18 Amendment, rights run the opposite way. Hastings is the 19 government; CLS is private. A public forum for speech 20 must be open and inclusive, but participants in the 21 forum are entitled to their own voice. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, these are fundamental 23 arguments, and I don't want to spend too much time on 24 factual matters because that's frustrating to both the 25 Court and the counsel.

1 But we do have the problem of the 2 stipulation. The stipulation makes it clear that 3 Democrats and Republicans can both get into the other 4 one's club. That's the Stipulations 17 and 18 at 220 of the 5 Joint Appendix. You want to get away from the 6 stipulation by what, according to your reply brief, 7 Hastings said in its answer, but the stipulation 8 supersedes the answer. 9 So if both counsel could just address for a 10 moment: What is the case that we have here? You have 11 different views on what case is before us. 12 MR. McCONNELL: Happy to, Justice Kennedy. 13 If you just look with me at Joint 14 Stipulation 17, I think it makes this completely clear. 15 That's on page 221 of the Joint Appendix, and it states: 16 "Both parties agreed that in order to become a 17 registered student organization a student organization's 18 bylaws must provide that its membership is open to all 19 students" -- that's the all-comers policy -- "and the 20 organization must agree to abide by" -- "abide by the 21 Nondiscrimination Policy." That's capital N, capital P, 22 a defined term. The "Nondiscrimination Policy" is 23 defined in Joint Stipulation Number 15. That is what we 24 have been calling the written policy. And the idea that 25 membership must be open to all students is described in
4
Alderson Reporting Company

1 Joint Stipulation 18, which is simply a description of 2 what that policy is. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: But doesn't -- doesn't the 4 one -- isn't the all-comers policy broader than the 5 nondiscrimination policy, so that if you comply with 6 that you automatically comply with everything in the 7 nondiscrimination clause? 8 MR. McCONNELL: It is broader. It's our 9 position that either of these justifications for 10 excluding CLS is unconstitutional. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but the latter, 12 the nondiscrimination policy, you assert is -- is not 13 viewpoint neutral, that it has a particular impact upon 14 a religious organization; whereas, the other policy, the 15 all-comers policy, applies to everybody, and that 16 argument is not available to you. 17 MR. McCONNELL: Justice Scalia, our 18 argument -- there are two policies. They have invoked 19 both. We believe both are unconstitutional, but for 20 slightly different reasons. The written policy is 21 unconstitutional because it's overtly viewpoint 22 discrimination -- discriminatory and thus violating 23 the principles of cases like Rosenberger and Widmar. 24 The all-comers -25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. McConnell,
5

1 Justice Scalia had just made the point that the all-comers 2 policy overwhelms the other, so that I would like you to 3 deal up front with the all-comers policy that the dean 4 in her deposition said, loud and clear: "Our policy is 5 all-comers. Yes, Republicans have to be admitted to the 6 Democratic group and vice versa." So unless you are 7 challenging the veracity of the dean after stipulating, 8 as you did, that all-comers is the policy, I don't see 9 how we can listen to your argument about the so-called 10 written policy. 11 MR. McCONNELL: Well, both policies we contend 12 are unconstitutional. Let's begin with the all-comers 13 policy, and when you conclude that it is 14 unconstitutional, we will also need to deal with the 15 other since they have two arrows in their quiver. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You can do that, but you -17 it's a much different case if Hastings treats the CLS 18 differently than it treats the Democratic and Republican 19 Clubs. That's a much different -- frankly, it's a much 20 easier case for you. But it's -- it's frustrating for 21 us not to know what kind of case we have in front of us. 22 MR. McCONNELL: Your Honor, it's a case 23 where the -- where Hastings has put forward two quite 24 different justifications for denying our right and both 25 of them are unconstitutional.

1 Let's begin with the all-comers policy. 2 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. McConnell, when I 3 read -- when I read the papers that Hastings submitted 4 to the district court at the same time that the joint 5 stipulation was submitted, I saw one reference after 6 another to an allegation that Hastings was applying its 7 policy in a discriminatory manner, that it was not in 8 fact insisting that all registered student organizations 9 admit all applicants. And when I read their brief in 10 the Ninth Circuit, I saw that point reiterated again and 11 again. 12 So that led me to believe that what was 13 stipulated was not that in fact they had a policy which 14 they enforced under which anybody who applied to any 15 group would be admitted, but that this was what Dean 16 Kane had announced. That was the stated policy, but not 17 necessarily the actual policy that was employed. And 18 that was the argument it seemed to me that CLS was 19 making; isn't that correct? 20 MR. McCONNELL: That's entirely correct, 21 Justice -- Justice Alito. That's -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you should -- if that 23 was it you should have brought in some -- some evidence 24 of different treatment of other groups. And there -25 as I --

When -7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. McConnell, here 8 is a statement, a stipulation. It's a stipulation for 9 summary judgment. It says: District Judge, you take 10 this to be the fact: Hastings requires that registered 11 student organizations allow any student to participate, 12 become a member, seek leadership positions in the 13 organization. That is not qualified. It says: 14 District Judge, here are the facts that we stipulate. 15 It doesn't say this is what the dean says, but it's not 16 really enforced. It's not qualified at all. 17 MR. McCONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, we -- we 18 stipulated that this was their policy. That stipulation 19 contains nothing about the historical facts as to how 20 Hastings has actually applied it. But let's talk about 21 the policy, because it is unconstitutional -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: I wish you would. You are 23 going to waste your whole time just discussing this 24 stipulation point. Let's assume -- let's assume that -25 MR. McCONNELL: Yes.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the latter is the policy. 2 MR. McCONNELL: Yes, because the policy is I 3 think blatantly unconstitutional. It is manifestly 4 overbroad with respect to any purposes stated. And, of 5 course, in Healy v. James, this Court held that any 6 restriction on a student speech forum may be no more 7 extensive than is required by its purposes. It is also 8 a frontal assault on freedom of association. Freedom of 9 association is the right to form around shared beliefs. 10 To say that groups may not form around shared beliefs -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is this an exception 12 that you want to talk about as it is applied to 13 religious groups, or are you suggesting that if a group 14 wanted to exclude all black people, all women, all 15 handicapped persons, whatever other form of 16 discrimination a group wants to practice, that a school 17 has to accept that group and recognize it, give it funds, 18 and otherwise lend it space? 19 MR. McCONNELL: Not at all, Justice 20 Sotomayor. Our position is that -21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So then, what is -22 what is wrong with the purpose of a school to say we don't 23 wish any group that doesn't -- that discriminates? 24 MR. McCONNELL: The stipulation is that they 25 may not exclude based on status or beliefs. We have

McCONNELL: -- that you just have to let 6 you in that don't agree with you. 7 JUSTICE STEVENS: What if the belief is that 8 African Americans are inferior? 9 MR. McCONNELL: Again, I think they can 10 discriminate on the basis of the belief, but not on 11 the basis of the status. So that if the -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: You could have -13 MR. McCONNELL: -- if there were racist 14 organizations -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- a student 16 organization, I suppose, of that type. It wouldn't 17 include many people. But if there were such an 18 organization, I assume that they would have that -- that 19 belief required, right? 20 MR. McCONNELL: That's right, but they could 21 not go the next step and exclude someone on the basis of 22 status, under our -23 JUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't this say the 24 opposite? It says we are -- you have to let anybody in -25 anybody -- regardless of their status or beliefs. So you can't
10

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 discriminate on the basis of status or belief. That's 2 what the policy says I just read. It doesn't say you 3 can; it says you can't. 4 MR. McCONNELL: It's that the group may not 5 confine its leadership based upon its beliefs. That means 6 that -7 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what you say, but 8 that's not what the policy says. The policy says that 9 you have to let everybody in, regardless of their status 10 or belief. 11 MR. McCONNELL: Right. And -- and our view is 12 that the status -13 JUSTICE BREYER: So you cannot discriminate on 14 the basis of status or belief. 15 MR. McCONNELL: The status half of that is 16 perfectly constitutional and -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: You say you -18 MR. McCONNELL: -- the belief half of that is not. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: -- you have to -- you 20 have to let these organizations discriminate on the 21 basis of belief. And they say: No, we don't want to; 22 that's too complicated for us to figure out which ones 23 we should, which ones we shouldn't. We'd rather let them 24 work off-campus. We just don't want to get into this 25 business. It's not just against religion. It might be

1 against a Turkish-speaking society that thinks Turkish 2 is extremely important to speak or a chess club that 3 thinks the same. It could be a lot of people. 4 Now, why do you -- what's wrong with us, a First 5 Amendment -- an organization itself affected with First 6 Amendment interests, saying we just don't want to have 7 those on campus organizations, too much trouble. 8 MR. McCONNELL: What is -- what is wrong with 9 that is that restrictions on a designated public forum must 10 be reasonable in light of the purposes of the forum. The 11 purpose of the forum is set forth in Joint Stipulation 12 Number 8. It is to promote a diversity of viewpoints 13 among registered student organizations. If the student 14 organizations are not allowed to have a coherent set of 15 beliefs, there can be no diversity among them. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this sounds like a 17 debate over whether the policy as the school believes it 18 should be implemented is not a good one. But isn't that 19 their choice? Don't we give deference to an educational 20 institution in terms of the choices it makes about 21 effecting its own -- its purposes? And the purpose here 22 is we don't want our students to discriminate. 23 MR. McCONNELL: There is a stipulation as to 24 what the purpose is, and the purpose is to promote a 25 diversity of viewpoints among registered student

1 organizations. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And is -3 JUSTICE BREYER: That's their way of doing 4 that. 5 MR. McCONNELL: It is a stipulated fact. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And Hastings takes the 7 position that it's all in favor of diversity, not only 8 among the groups but within the groups. So -9 MR. McCONNELL: Which is not the joint 10 stipulation. The stipulation is that the purpose of the 11 forum is diversity among groups. Their policy is not -12 it's not only just unreasonable in light of it; it is 13 contrary to it. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It is that they -15 MR. McCONNELL: It defeats the purpose of the forum. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They say, yes, we believe in 17 diversity among groups, but we also believe in diversity 18 within the group; that's a good thing. They are not backing 19 off from: We think diversity among groups is fine. 20 MR. McCONNELL: They say that in their 21 brief, but that is not the stipulated fact in the 22 case. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Let me make an imaginary 24 example, and that's -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is the

1 stipulation? 2 MR. McCONNELL: It's page 216 in the Joint 3 Appendix, Joint Stipulation Number 8. It is the only 4 stipulation in the case having to do with what the 5 purpose is of the RSO forum. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute now. A 7 diversity -8 MR. McCONNELL: "Hastings seeks to promote a 9 diversity of viewpoints among registered student 10 organizations." 11 And note how destructive an all-comers 12 policy directed on belief is toward -- toward that. 13 That means that if, for example, there's an NAACP 14 chapter, it would have to allow a -- a racist skinhead 15 to sit on -- in on its planning meetings. That means 16 that if there's an environmentalist club that has a 17 demonstration in Sacramento in favor of cap-and-trade 18 legislation, they would have to allow -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It may be -20 MR. McCONNELL: -- a global warming skeptic 21 to -22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It may be an ill-advised 23 policy, but the school says: It's our policy.

1 MR. McCONNELL: They haven't happened 2 because this policy came into being -- was announced for 3 the first time in 2005. So there couldn't possibly be 4 any -- any record of that. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: This -- this was not the 6 policy on the basis of which CLS was excluded; is that 7 correct? 8 MR. McCONNELL: That's correct, it was not. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- when they were 10 refused participation in the -- in the student 11 organization program, they were not told about the 12 all-comers policy. 13 MR. McCONNELL: That's correct. Joint 14 Stipulation Number 40 states clearly that the -- that the 15 -- that they were informed, and I quote: "They were 16 informed that CLS bylaws were not compliant with the 17 religion and sexual orientation provisions of the 18 Nondiscrimination Policy." 19 JUSTICE ALITO: And was there any written 20 document memorializing this policy prior to the time 21 when the former dean gave her deposition? 22 MR. McCONNELL: Never. And -23 JUSTICE ALITO: And is the -- is the policy 24 as articulated by the dean in her deposition the same as 25 the policy that Hastings now claims it has in its brief?
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. McCONNELL: I don't think so. Every 2 time the policy is mentioned, it seems to morph into 3 something else. When the dean announced it at the 4 deposition, she said all students may participate on 5 the -- in all activities, period, full stop. Now we 6 find out in their brief, well, their -- groups can have 7 conduct limitations, they can require dues, they can 8 have attendance requirements, they can have competitive 9 contests to see whether they get in. 10 This -- this policy is -- it changes with 11 every wind. 12 And -- but the fundamental problem with 13 this -- with this is what -- what this Court stated in 14 Velazquez v. Legal Services Corporation, that you cannot 15 allow -- you cannot allow the terms of the policy just 16 to say that whatever their policy is, that that 17 determines the contours of the program, because that 18 would render the First Amendment a -- a nullity. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, that was not a 20 religion case. Your argument at its most fundamental 21 level is that religious organizations are different 22 because religion is all about belief. But at that point 23 don't we also have a tradition of separation? That's 24 the whole reason why church and state for many purposes 25 are kept separate, so that States are not implicated

1 with religious beliefs. 2 And it -- it -- it seems to me we have to 3 consider that when we are considering your argument. 4 Now, you can cite Rosenberger, but -- but I think this is 5 different from that. 6 MR. McCONNELL: The separation is between 7 church and state, but this Court has held over and over 8 again that speech forums -- that people participating in 9 a speech forum are not the state. The state is 10 Hastings. We are perfectly private. There is nothing 11 wrong with a religious organization, even on public -12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're not -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Anyway, as I understand 14 your argument on the all-comers policy, it is not an 15 argument that -- that is based upon the religious nature 16 of CLS. You would make the same argument of 17 unconstitutionality with respect to the student 18 Republican Club, wouldn't you? 19 MR. McCONNELL: We would. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or -21 MR. McCONNELL: Now, we do -22 there is in addition a free exercise argument, but I 23 don't -- but in this case what the Free Exercise Clause 24 protects is exactly what the associational freedom test 25 would protect for everyone.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I had thought that an 2 important part of the case, of your case, is that belief 3 is inherent to the idea of religious expression and must 4 be protected. But if the protection causes problems 5 within the school for other policies, then doesn't the 6 separation policy come into play? That's -- that's what 7 I'm asking. 8 MR. McCONNELL: Again, separation does not 9 apply to private parties when they are operating, even 10 on government property. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McConnell, let's say 12 it is the belief of this group, based on their reading 13 of the Bible, that only white men can lead the Bible 14 studies, can become officers of the group, and that's 15 based on their fundamental belief that that's what the 16 Bible instructs. On your view, must Hastings give this 17 organization status as a recognized student 18 organization? 19 MR. McCONNELL: No, Justice Ginsburg. Our 20 position is it is unconstitutional to -- to prohibit 21 groups to form around beliefs but not around status. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the belief is -- this 23 is the belief. 24 MR. McCONNELL: They can insist that -- that 25 everyone who participates in the group have that belief,
18
Alderson Reporting Company

1 and that, as Justice Scalia said, may mean it's going to 2 be a very small group. But they cannot discriminate on 3 the basis of status. But belief -- as this Court said 4 in Cantwell v. Connecticut, belief, the freedom to 5 believe, is absolute. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, they -- they would have 7 to negate their belief in their practice. They could 8 believe this, but they couldn't implement it? 9 MR. McCONNELL: Well, it's not unusual to 10 say people -- people can believe in all kinds of things 11 that are illegal. That doesn't mean that they can do 12 them. It's not a -- it's not an unfamiliar distinction 13 in our law. But let's look at -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: This was the basis -- your 15 distinction between status and belief was the basis for 16 your saying that the original policy, whatever -17 whatever we call it -- what is the name of it? 18 MR. McCONNELL: The written policy? 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: The written policy -- when 20 it forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual 21 orientation was complied with by CLS because it would 22 not discriminate on the basis of orientation, only on 23 the basis of belief. 24 MR. McCONNELL: That's correct. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: If -- if a homosexual

And what it objects to is having -- is 5 being run by non-Christians, because after all, this is 6 a group whose very purpose is -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You keep talking about 8 being forced to let people in. And this is where I'm a 9 little bit confused by your yellow brief. 10 The school has taken the position that any 11 group can apply to use its facilities; priority and 12 funding, et cetera, will only go to recognized student 13 groups. But your group is not being excluded or 14 ostracized completely from the school. Presumably, you 15 can meet in the cafeteria. You can meet in open spaces 16 in the school. You can apply like everyone else, any 17 other nonstudent group, recognized student group. But 18 you have been saying repeatedly in your presentation 19 that you're barred from the campus. And so I'm a little 20 confused as to exactly -21 MR. McCONNELL: What I -- Justice Sotomayor, 22 I believe what we consistently say is that we have been 23 denied the right to meet on campus. And that is 24 completely true. Look -- if you would look at Joint 25 Stipulation Number 10, at the top of page 219, it provides
22

1 that CLS, although not currently registered, is eligible 2 to apply for permission for rooms. But there is no 3 stipulation that that will ever be granted, and the 4 record shows that every time CLS has requested 5 permission to meet they have gotten a complete 6 run-around. They have been told: Well, you have to 7 apply through your lawyer, and then their -- they don't 8 get an answer on time and when they get an answer it's, 9 well, because you're not a registered student group -10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But let's -- could we -11 MR.

But let's assume two things: One, 17 that in fact you have the option of applying for use of 18 the space and that, assuming there are no conflicts and 19 other things that -- that are in the normal course would 20 preclude your use, that you would be granted use. Is your 21 argument different in that situation? 22 MR. McCONNELL: Justice Sotomayor, even the 23 access to campus communications is absolutely essential, 24 as this Court said in the -- in Healy v.

But that's precisely why 6 Hastings might argue to us that -- that this is 7 inconsistent with their idea of what this forum is. And 8 if -- will you just address that, please? 9 MR. McCONNELL: I would address it. The 10 forum -- the purposes of the forum are undisputed. They 11 are to provide a diversity of expression among student 12 groups. Their policy disserves the purpose of the forum 13 and therefore cannot be regarded as reasonable in light 14 of that. And what is more, what they have done is -15 it's also not reasonable because it's independently 16 unconstitutional. What they have done is they've said 17 you may not have fundamental freedom of association or, 18 if you do, we will withdraw an otherwise available 19 benefit from you. 20 As recently as the unanimous decision of 21 this Court in FAIR v. Rumsfeld, the Court reiterated the 22 -- the now I think 100-year old principle that 23 constitutional rights may not be penalized by the 24 withdrawal of benefits any more than they can by -- by 25 direct prohibition.

GARRE 7 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 8 MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 9 and may it please the Court: 10 This case was decided by both courts below 11 on the premise, which is not disputed at any point in the 12 petition for certiorari, that Hastings reserves the 13 funding and benefits that go to student groups that 14 obtain school recognition to groups that choose to admit 15 all students 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why do 17 you have -18 MR. GARRE: -- regardless of their status or 19 their beliefs. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you have a policy, 21 a written policy -- you don't have a written policy that says 22 anything about all-comers. You've got a written 23 policy that says you can -- you can't discriminate on 24 the basis of only one type of belief, religious belief. 25 MR. GARRE: Mr. Chief Justice, first of all,

GARRE: No. It's -- it's the way in which 10 Hastings implements the nondiscrimination policy in this 11 particular forum. And, again, look at the Ninth Circuit 12 decision in this case. It's -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: That is not an 14 implementation of the nondiscrimination policy. I mean, 15 the two policies are quite different. Now, are you 16 telling us that the written policy is no longer 17 operative? 18 MR. GARRE: No, it -- Justice Scalia, this 19 is -20 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, what? No, it's not 21 operative or no, you're not telling me that? 22 (Laughter.) 23 MR. GARRE: It is operative. This -- the 24 all-comers policy is how it's implemented in this 25 context.

And this is spelled out, I believe in 13 page -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they -- so you're 15 saying the second paragraph is totally 16 unnecessary. You say the first paragraph says you can't 17 discriminate on any basis, and the second paragraph 18 spells out the bases. So why do you do have the second 19 paragraph? 20 MR. GARRE: I think it provides additional 21 guidance. But -- but, again, there shouldn't be any 22 debate about what policy is at issue here.

So in that respect -9 JUSTICE ALITO: So the answer is yes, this case 10 which is -- before us has produced hundreds and hundreds of 11 pages of amicus briefs, deserved two sentences in the 12 court of appeals? 13 MR. GARRE: In the -- in the sense that it 14 was backed up by the Truth decision, yes. But look at 15 the petition for certiorari in this case. Nowhere did 16 -- did Petitioners challenge the Ninth Circuit's 17 characterization of the policy at issue. The petition 18 says on page 2 that "There are no disputed issues of 19 material fact." 20 JUSTICE ALITO: But hasn't it been -- hasn't 21 it been CLS's position from the very beginning of this 22 case that Hastings has not in fact required every group 23 to admit any student who applies?

1 the things they've pointed to is the bylaws saying, like 2 the Outlaw bylaw, that says that students who are 3 members of a group can be excelled if they -- expelled 4 if they engage in disruptive or gross misconduct. There 5 is nothing inconsistent about that with the school's 6 policy. The school's interest is not in allowing 7 students to disrupt the activities of students' 8 groups -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they -- they 10 quite -- quote the bylaws of the National Lawyers Guild, 11 which says any member must "agree with the objectives 12 of the organization as set forth herein." That's not 13 all-comers. That's a bylaw that restricts an 14 organization according to its -- members can't join 15 unless they sign on the dotted line that they believe in 16 objectives of the organization. 17 MR.

GARRE: Mr. Chief Justice, as -- as 10 Dean -- as director of student services testified, the 11 fact that the bylaws may say we want students who are 12 interested in our activities doesn't mean that the 13 bylaws are excluding students who want to join. And 14 there's a fundamental difference, again, between saying 15 students that have these particular beliefs or status 16 cannot become members of our group -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that 18 your position is continually evolving wherever the First 19 Amendment pressure comes. You've got a written 20 nondiscrimination policy. And then you say, well, yes, 21 but we use an all-comers policy. You've got an 22 all-comers policy, and then groups don't actually follow 23 the all-comers policy, and you have another answer to 24 that. It seems to me that we should go with -- why 25 shouldn't we go with the written policy and the written

Frankly, one reason why I am 5 inclined to think this is pretextual is that it is so 6 weird to require the -- the campus Republican Club to 7 admit Democrats, not just to membership, but to 8 officership. To require this Christian society to allow 9 atheists not just to join, but to conduct Bible classes, 10 right? That's crazy. 11 (Laughter.) 12 MR.

GARRE: A few -- a number of things, 13 Justice Kennedy. The first is the line-drawing issue 14 that has been made clear during the first part of the 15 argument this morning. If you're going -- they appear 16 to take off the table race and what they say are other 17 status considerations. I'm not sure why that excludes 18 sexual orientation. 19 But if you're going to allow religious 20 groups, or any group, to draw exceptions for some 21 people, then you have to determine where to draw the 22 line. And I think a school can reasonably say: We 23 don't want to get into this business at all; we want to 24 allow all comers 25 JUSTICE ALITO: But you now say --

Isn't that right? 5 MR. GARRE: That doesn't go to status or 6 belief. If you're talking about attendance 7 requirements or competition -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, you're talking 9 about -10 MR. GARRE: -- those are merits-based 11 requirements. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- La Raza background. 13 As I understand it, the La Raza organization says you have 14 to be of La Raza background to be a policy member of the 15 organization. 16 MR. GARRE: The La Raza bylaws -- first of 17 all, they did explicitly say that groups could not 18 exclude members on the basis of sexual orientation. 19 Now, they -- there was some confusion about 20 how La Raza had interpreted their bylaws. The school 21 went back to La Raza and said: Are you excluding 22 members? La Raza said: No, we're not; we're open to 23 all. And to eliminate any doubt, they amended their 24 bylaws. That's the one example they've come up in the 25 20-year history of this policy. And what does it show?

1 If you want to look at -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, wait, wait. Twenty 3 years? Do you have any evidence that this policy, the 4 one we're arguing about now, that is to say, the 5 all-comers policy, existed before CLS brought this 6 litigation? As I recall, the only evidence in the 7 record is a letter from the dean describing this policy 8 after the litigation began. 9 MR. GARRE: Justice Scalia, it's based on 10 the sworn deposition testimony on the former dean, who 11 had been at the school since 1993, the director of 12 student services, who had been there at least since 13 1999, as this is how they had implemented the 14 nondiscrimination policy. I don't think there's any 15 basis for this Court to overturn that sworn testimony. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: What we have is a rule, a 17 stipulation. And as I read it, to try to make sense out 18 of it, it does seem to discriminate against 19 organizations in respect to which intellectual purity 20 would be important. They're going to have a harder 21 time. The ones that don't care that much will have an 22 easier time. 23 Now, in trying to judge the 24 constitutionality of that, I first have no idea which 25 these organizations are. We've got one of them, but

I don't know how the chess club 5 feels about players of tiddlywinks. 6 (Laughter.) 7 JUSTICE BREYER: So I have an absolute void 8 in this record, which in turn I think would be important 9 to fill that void, because their justification -10 MR. GARRE: Well -11 JUSTICE BREYER: -- is they don't want to get 12 into this, it's too complicated, and we're not 13 doing that much harm to them because they can meet 14 off-campus, and it's a big, disruptive influence, all of 15 these things. 16 And then sneaking in here is this anti-gay 17 bias issue, and -- and they want to say: That isn't 18 much, because that isn't really the point here, and 19 that's what we think, anyway. It's just an example of 20 something. 21 So with that great unclarity, asked to 22 decide a constitutional issue where I feel I'd need more 23 facts and I don't have them -24 MR.

But there are schools, 13 including law schools, that have this policy. Is that 14 not so? 15 MR. GARRE: That's true. Georgetown Law 16 School does. Columbia Law School. Look, there's an 17 amicus brief filed by 13 educational organizations 18 representing thousands of colleges and universities 19 across the country, including the Association of Jesuit 20 Colleges and Universities, saying that this is a 21 not-uncommon and a reasonable policy.

Suppose at a particular 4 campus there is a great deal of anti-Muslim animus. 5 And there's a small Muslim group; it has 10 students. 6 If the group is required to accept anybody who applies 7 for membership, and 50 students who hate Muslims show up 8 and they want to take over that group, you say the First 9 Amendment allows that? 10 MR. GARRE: Justice Alito, that's the 11 claim, obviously, that the other side is making. And, 12 with respect, this example has never happened at 13 Hastings in 20 years. It has really never happened in 14 the history of American education. If you look at cases 15 like the voter I.D. case, the partial-birth abortion 16 case -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you have a law 18 that says every newspaper that's published in the 19 United States must be reviewed every day by the 20 government's censor board, and the fact that the 21 government's censor board decides not to do it, then 22 that law is okay? 23 MR.

This Court said, look, that might 10 happen, but it's not a basis to invalidate this law 11 across the board. Come back with an as-applied challenge. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was because 13 they might adopt a different policy. We're not dealing 14 with a future different policy in this case. 15 MR. GARRE: And there's -- as to the 16 takeover hypothetical, there is no evidence that it has 17 happened. Groups can take measures to prevent it.

So, your answer is that they could not be 15 recognized under Hastings' policy because of their 16 religious beliefs regarding the way religious services 17 should be conducted? 18 MR.

In the Bob Jones case, the claim was 9 from a -- a small private religious school that has a 10 sincere religious belief that people who believed in 11 interracial dating should not become members of their 12 school. And this Court, nevertheless, held that that 13 belief, sincere as it was, did not trump a statute that 14 denied education -- denied Federal financial assistance 15 on a viewpoint-neutral basis to schools that 16 discriminated on the basis of religion. 17 Here we have a -- a group that wants to 18 exclude members on the basis of sexual orientation.

Keep 9 in mind that this case began because CLS came back to 10 the law school and said we're happy to say we won't 11 discriminate on some grounds, but we're not going to 12 say we won't exclude students on the basis of sexual 13 orientation. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: What's supposed to happen? 15 I don't know the answer to this. Hastings, let's say, 16 or Berkeley has four or five or six different religious 17 chapels for services on Sunday or Saturday, and they say 18 we're open to all branches of religion, orthodox Jews, 19 conservative, and reformed. And then the orthodox say 20 we want men and women to sit separately. 21 Now, can Hastings say or Berkeley, no, we'll 22 let the reform come, we'll let the conservatives come, 23 but not the -- not the orthodox Jews. They can't 24 have their service. Would -- would that be 25 constitutional?

1 club. 2 MR. GARRE: The reason why the school has a 3 policy that all groups that it subsidizes must admit 4 all-comers is that, number one, it ensures that all 5 students enjoy equal access to all school-subsidized and 6 school-recognized activities. 7 Number two, it avoids the line-drawing 8 problems that we've discussed early this morning and I 9 think are necessarily going to arise and also create 10 strife in small educational communities. 11 Number three, it allows -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask about number 2, 13 the -- the so-called line-drawing problem? Aren't you 14 just letting yourself into even more line-drawing 15 problems? 16 MR. GARRE: Not with the all-comers rule. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the other -- it's 18 whether you were discriminating on the basis of one of 19 the forbidden bases. But now you're saying you can't 20 discriminate on any basis, which means there're going 21 to be even more lines to have to draw. Why does it 22 solve your problem? 23 MR.

1 regardless of their status or belief, that gets the 2 school out of the business of determining whether, 3 number one, people are discriminating on the basis of an 4 essential belief, which is, is the way that Petitioner 5 describes his -- their rule. 6 JUSTICE ALITO: As I understood the 7 position, your latest position in your brief, you 8 really don't say you have an all-comers policy. There 9 are certain criteria that can be applied, like interest, 10 knowledge; is that correct? 11 MR. GARRE: Competitive-based, merit-based 12 requirements are not excluded. It -- they're 13 not -14 JUSTICE ALITO: Could a -- well, could a 15 group, consistent with your revised all-comers policy, 16 require that members who want -- anyone who wants to 17 become a member show a particular level of knowledge 18 about the subject of the group? 19 MR. GARRE: Yes. And I think -20 JUSTICE ALITO: So if the CLS required 21 anybody who wanted to become a member to pass a test on 22 the Bible, that would be okay? 23 MR.

1 determinations. There's a fundamental difference 2 between excluding people on the basis of merit and 3 excluding people on the basis of status or belief that 4 has no connection to merit. That -- that, I think, is a 5 long-standing understanding of discrimination. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that -7 that -- that's pretty tough. That has no connection to 8 merit. I assume there are groups that think subscribing 9 to their beliefs is evidence of merit, particularly 10 religious groups. So, how can you have a -- a test that 11 allows distinctions based on merit but not -- not 12 beliefs? 13 MR. GARRE: I think it goes to the nature of 14 whether it's discrimination under the school's policy, 15 and I think status or belief. People understand -- that's 16 why we are talking about things like race or gender or 17 sexual orientation, disability, military status, any 18 number of these things. And I think the school's policy 19 avoids having to draw lines as to whether or not a group 20 has a sufficient enough belief that military members 21 should become a member of the Amnesty International club 22 because they disagree with the war, that disabled 23 members should be -- disabled students should be a 24 member of a particular group.

1 MR. GARRE: It -- yes. We don't think that 2 that's the case here. But if a policy is applied 3 evenhandedly -- unevenhandedly, in a viewpoint-neutral 4 way and it burdens religious groups, then there's 5 common ground that that policy violates the 6 Constitution. Of course, we think the policy here is -7 JUSTICE ALITO: If this were an employment 8 case, and when an employee is denied promotion the 9 employee said it's for reason A, and then after 10 litigation begins the employer says, well, no, it really 11 wasn't for reason A, it was for reason B because of a 12 policy that we've long had, but there's never -13 there's no written documentation of this new policy; 14 and then at a later point in the litigation the employer 15 says, well, it wasn't really either for reason A or 16 reason B; it was for reason C -- do you think that summary 17 judgment could be granted in favor of the employer on 18 the issue of pretext? 19 MR. GARRE: I think that that would create a 20 factual issue and that that issue might well be tried, 21 Justice Alito. 22 And the one thing that is important to keep in 23 mind is that this is a request for injunctive relief and not 24 damages. So the only policy that matters -- and Wilkinson v. 25 Austin makes this clear -- is the current policy; all

All 5 parties do not agree that the policy is the all-comers 6 policy. Your friend argued repeatedly that the policy 7 was the written nondiscrimination policy. 8 MR. GARRE: I understood my friend's opening 9 brief to acknowledge at the least that that's the policy 10 the school has said it has today. It is the school's 11 policy. It's supported by substantial history and 12 sworn deposition testimony. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, the -- the 14 so-called written policy, that has a -- that list has a 15 correspondence to the State's law, doesn't it? 16 MR.

And that is an 21 additional basis for the school's policy. Look at 22 California Education Code 66270. It explicitly 23 prohibits discrimination in -- in programs and 24 educational activities by public schools like Hastings. 25 Hastings has an obligation under State law to prohibit

The 2 reason why we're here today is because CLS insisted 3 on the right to discriminate, to exclude students on the 4 basis of their sexual orientation. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, section 66270 applies 6 to programs conducted by a post-secondary educational 7 institution, and your position is that if -- if a 8 religious group complies with your policies and then it 9 conducts religious services, those religious services 10 are conducted by Hastings? 11 MR. GARRE: Our position is that the 12 registered student organization program is a program 13 of the university; it's subsidized by the university; 14 it's recognized by the university; and that all students 15 should be able to enjoy access to that program. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In your response to 17 Justice Ginsburg concerning California law, is it your 18 position that California law requires religious groups 19 to admit people who do not believe in their religious 20 beliefs and in fact to conduct services of that group? 21 MR.

They are not in 17 the record, and, frankly, I'd be a little bit 18 surprised, because the policy is so absurd. 19 Think of how it would apply to the law 20 school itself, and this policy does apply to the law 21 school itself. Does Hastings really mean to say it is 22 committing itself to an all-comers policy when it hires 23 faculty or admits students? Do they not care about the 24 belief of its dean of admissions, about beliefs of -25 about, say, affirmative action? The very idea of it is
