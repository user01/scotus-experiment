3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:22 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in Case 10-1293, Federal Communications 5 Commission v. Fox Television Stations. 6 General Verrilli. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and 10 may it please the Court: 11 In its previous decision in this case, the 12 Court observed that when a broadcast licensee takes a 13 license for the free and exclusive use of a valuable 14 part of the public domain, it also accepts enforceable 15 public obligations. One of those enforceable 16 obligations is the indecency restriction which Congress 17 has instructed the Federal Communications Commission to 18 enforce between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. 19 Respondents in this case have for years 20 benefited enormously from their free and exclusive use 21 of public spectrum. They argue, however, that neither 22 Congress nor the commission may as a condition of their 23 licenses require that they refrain from broadcasting 24 indecent material when children are most likely to be in 25 the audience.

1 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, General Verrilli, it 2 seems to me that this contract notion of yours can only 3 go so far. I mean, if the idea is just we gave them 4 something, now they have to do whatever we say, you 5 wouldn't accept that. So, the question is why is this 6 condition appropriate when many other conditions would 7 not be appropriate? I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, if 8 you would say all conditions are appropriate. But I -9 I frankly think you wouldn't. 10 GENERAL VERRILLI: This condition is 11 appropriate, Justice Kagan, because it has been a 12 defining feature of the broadcast medium from its 13 inception in the 1920s in the Radio Act and has 14 continued to be a defining feature of this medium 15 throughout its history. And the argument that my 16 friends on the other side are making here is that that 17 norm, that legally enforceable norm which has been 18 recognized by this Court in Pacifica and has been 19 applied since the inception of this medium, needs to be 20 overturned now because circumstances have changed. 21 And I would point out first, if I may, 22 something that -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's one of their 24 arguments. I mean, another one is that you haven't 25 defined it precisely enough, right?

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
5 1 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, that's true. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a separate -- really 3 a separate argument. 4 GENERAL VERRILLI: That's certainly true, 5 Justice Scalia, and I will certainly get to vagueness, 6 if I -- if I may just continue on this line. 7 The -- their argument is that circumstances 8 have fundamentally changed. I want to point out at the 9 outset something I think is significant, which is that 10 their argument would sweep away indecency restriction 11 with respect to radio as well as television, and they 12 would sweep that away in the arguments they are making 13 today without making any showing that circumstances have 14 changed at all with respect to the ubiquity of -- or 15 accessibility of radio. 16 And I think if one looks at the FCC orders 17 that this Court cited in its prior decision in this 18 case, one will see that a lot of the most vile and lewd 19 material really is in radio. So, I just want to put 20 that marker down at the beginning here because I do 21 think it is quite important. No showing has been made 22 about radio. 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't quite understand 24 that. Today there's a -- there's either a potential or 25 a fact of violent and objectionable broadcasting in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
6 1 radio? I didn't quite -- just to understand your point. 2 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. Pacifica itself, 3 Justice Kennedy, was a case about a radio broadcast. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, I understand that. 5 Yes. 6 GENERAL VERRILLI: And the Respondents are 7 arguing in this case that Pacifica ought to be overruled 8 because the circumstances that justified its rule no 9 longer obtain. I want to put a marker in at the outset 10 here with respect to radio, because I do think it's 11 quite important, that they haven't made any argument 12 that those circumstances are any different with respect 13 to radio. It's just as ubiquitous as it was. There 14 isn't even any argument that there's blocking technology 15 available. And I want to make sure, given the kind of 16 vile material that the record demonstrates has been 17 transmitted over time on radio, that the Court focuses 18 on the breadth of the argument that the Respondents are 19 making here. 20 Now, with respect to television, I do think 21 they're making an argument that -- that television 22 broadcasting is no longer uniquely pervasive in the way 23 that it was before. They're not making an argument -24 but that, if I may, is a very different kind of argument 25 than one would normally get in support of a -- the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 suggestion that we ought to depart from stare decisis.

7

2 They're not -- they're not arguing that

3 broadcast television is any less pervasive than it was.

4 If anything, it's probably more pervasive now. They're

5 not arguing that the harms of that pervasiveness no

6 longer exist. What they're arguing is that there are

7 other media that present harms as well and that with

8 respect -- and that because those other media also

9 present harms, the circumstances require a change in the

10 rule with respect to broadcasters.

11 Now, that -- you can I think look at that in

12 one of two ways. You could say either that's an

13 argument that it's futile to continue to impose this

14 restriction on broadcasters. And I think that's what

15 Fox says at page 33 of its brief.

16 Two points in response to that. I think a

17 significant, if not complete, answer was in this Court's

18 prior decision in this case in which it said that the

19 maintenance of a safe haven is actually particularly

20 important in the context of these changes, a broadcast

21 safe haven. And also I do think that the idea of

22 futility in that nature is foreign to our First

23 Amendment jurisprudence.

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, I took

25 it from the briefs and what the FCC has been doing that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the major objection is that one cannot tell what's

8

2 indecent and what isn't; that it's FCC, the censor,

3 that's saying "Private Ryan" is okay, "Schindler's List"

4 is okay, but "NYPD Blue" is not. And I do think that

5 that is the major objection, that we have a government

6 agency that is going to make decisions about when nudity

7 is okay and when it isn't. You can't do it in terms of

8 time because "New York" -- the "NYPD" was 7 seconds and

9 another broadcast, "Catch-22," was 40 seconds.

10 So, it's -- it's the appearance of

11 arbitrariness about how the FCC is defining indecency in

12 concrete situations. That I think is the major flaw.

13 GENERAL VERRILLI: Let me turn to that,

14 Justice Ginsburg. The -- two points about that: The

15 first one is that as we read this Court's recent

16 decision in Humanitarian Law Project, the question on

17 the Fifth Amendment analysis of whether there is

18 vagueness and arbitrary enforcement has to be answered

19 by reference to the specific broadcasts at issue here.

20 In other words, was there fair notice with respect to

21 these specific broadcasts?

22 And I will get to that, but I -- but let me

23 first go directly to Your Honor's more significant

24 question. And I think the -- the problem with looking

25 at the case that way is that the lens is focused too

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 narrowly in that there, actually, if you -- one

9

2 broadens out the lens and looks at the wide range of

3 decisions that the commission is making about indecency

4 and then broadens it out even further and looks at the

5 wide range of broadcasts that occur, actually the number

6 of broadcasts are -- that have been identified as even

7 raising a question of arbitrariness or inconsistency is

8 a -- is really quite a miniscule fraction. It's even

9 quite a miniscule fraction even with respect to

10 broadcasts that the commission has adjudicated as

11 indecent or not indecent.

12 And, yes, we would concede that there is not

13 perfect clarity in this rule. It's a context-based

14 rule. As we read Pacifica, the Court suggested in

15 Pacifica that a context-based rule may well be what the

16 Constitution requires here, and that's going to result

17 in some -- something less than absolute precision. But

18 the -- of course, the alternative, I would assume from

19 my friend's perspective, would be worse. The commission

20 could have a list that said never say the following,

21 however many words; never show broadcasting between the

22 hours of 6:00 a.m. -- nudity between the hours of

23 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.

24 That would be clearer, but it would -- but,

25 in a way, the commission here, I think by following the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 context-based approach that I think Pacifica suggested

10

2 was required, is being -- I mean, "punished" is too

3 strong a word, but it's being held against it that it's

4 trying to make reasonable accommodations for First

5 Amendment values.

6 And so, I think when one looks at it both in

7 terms of where the lenses actually ought to be focused

8 here and the fact that the -- the alternative of perfect

9 clarity would reach a less effective accommodation of

10 First Amendment values, then I do think that the

11 commission's position is quite -- quite reasonable and

12 defensible.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: Could you -- could you

14 digress for one minute to help me understand the

15 procedural posture of this case. When it was here last

16 time, we were dealing with an issue called "fleeting

17 expletives," and that was Fox. And the Fox case

18 involved just that. They didn't really, or we didn't,

19 or the Court didn't, attack the 2001 order which is now

20 at issue. And then, without it going back to the

21 commission, the Second Circuit decided it on a ground

22 that sets aside the 2001 order.

23 Now, can we here just decide the fleeting

24 expletive case, because the fleeting expletive case has

25 to do with one subset of applications of the 2001 order

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 and has to do with part 2(2) or something. I mean, it

11

2 has -- and how you interpret the words "material dwells

3 on or repeats." Now, that I -- that I understand how to

4 get at.

5 The ABC case raises -- doesn't raise

6 fleeting expletives. It wasn't fleeting. And it raises

7 the question of the validity of -- under vagueness

8 grounds, of 2001 industry guidance and how that's been

9 applied. But the Second Circuit didn't deal with that

10 case. It sent it back to the commission.

11 So, has there been a commission decision

12 recently which has reviewed the basic arguments being

13 made here about the validity of the 2001 industry

14 guidance as applied? Has there been such a thing?

15 Alternatively, has there been an appeals

16 court holding on the -- or analysis of the ABC case?

17 GENERAL VERRILLI: I do -- I agree with you,

18 Justice Breyer, (a) that this is a complex procedural

19 posture; (b) that the Court would have some discretion

20 in how it approached and resolved the case.

21 With respect to the ABC case, as I read the

22 commission's orders, which are in the appendix to the

23 petition, it applied the 2001 industry guidance to reach

24 the conclusion that the ABC broadcast was indecent. And

25 then that was -- that -- then ABC appealed that to the

Alderson Reporting Company

1 Second Circuit --

Official

12

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Right.

3 GENERAL VERRILLI: -- as I understand it,

4 and that the Second Circuit then found that the -- that

5 the commission had violated the Constitution in reaching

6 that result. It first --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: But they didn't -- they

8 didn't in that case --

9 GENERAL VERRILLI: Right.

10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and they sent the ABC

11 case back. I see your --

12 GENERAL VERRILLI: They did on -- when it

13 came back, Your Honor, they then -- they disposed of the

14 Fox case with a lengthy opinion --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

16 GENERAL VERRILLI: -- and then essentially

17 applied that analysis to the ABC case.

18 JUSTICE BREYER: I see.

19 GENERAL VERRILLI: So, I think in

20 fairness --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. When this ABC

22 case was argued in front of the commission -- I have

23 here about 30 briefs at least, maybe 40, and they are

24 filled with very good arguments. Were those arguments

25 made to the commission in the context of the ABC case?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
13 1 Because as it comes up here, we are -- whereas I thought 2 when we granted cert, quite honestly, that this was Fox 3 coming back, as I've read the brief it isn't at all. 4 This is a new case, nothing to do with what we decided 5 before. This is the case of ABC, period. And it is an 6 attack on the 2001 guidelines, not fleeting expletives. 7 And, therefore, I want to know, at least 8 satisfy myself, that this Fox -- this ABC case has gone 9 through ordinary procedures and, indeed, these arguments 10 have all been made in front of the commission and 11 they've been rejected. 12 GENERAL VERRILLI: So, Justice Breyer, I'm 13 not sure that I can vouch for the proposition that the 14 arguments have all been made in front of the 15 commission -16 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not saying every one, 17 but has the essence of these arguments. 18 GENERAL VERRILLI: In fairness, I do think 19 that -- that if one reads the commission's disposition 20 of the -- the ABC case, it is applying the 2001 guidance 21 reaching the conclusion that the broadcast was indecent 22 under the 2001 guidance. ABC paid the fine that it was 23 assessed and then, as it has -- as it can do, then 24 invoked the Hobbs Act, went to the court of appeals to 25 challenge it. And so, I do think -- I do actually think
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that the issues have been considered by the agency and

14

2 are before the Court.

3 And I do agree with Your Honor, moving I

4 think more directly to the vagueness point, that there

5 really isn't a vagueness issue left with respect to the

6 fleeting expletives in the -- in the Fox case because

7 the Court said the last time the case was here that

8 there is no problem of arbitrary punishment because

9 there was no forfeiture or any other sanction.

10 ABC is in a different position because they

11 were sanctioned. And so, there is an issue with respect

12 to the question of whether the commission's indecency

13 standards can constitutionally be applied here and

14 whether they're too vague. But I do think, and I do --

15 I would like to spend a minute on that question of

16 whether there is vagueness as applied to the ABC

17 broadcast.

18 Now, the commission's standards in the 2001

19 guidance say that this is essentially a two-part test.

20 First is a subject matter question: Is there a

21 description or depiction of sexual or excretory

22 activities or organs? And then there's a question of

23 whether the depiction or description is patently

24 offensive under community standards for broadcast

25 informed by three factors: whether the expression is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 explicit, whether the broadcast dwells on it, and

15

2 whether it's shocking or pandering or titillating.

3 Now, ABC makes an argument with respect to

4 this broadcast that the nudity in the "NYPD Blue"

5 episode is outside of the first subject matter criteria

6 because it didn't have fair notice that buttocks would

7 be considered sexual organs for purposes of application

8 of this -- of this standard.

9 The commission said -- and this is at page

10 137a of the appendix to the petition -- that it's

11 impossible to believe that they didn't think that the

12 naked display of buttocks would bring them within --

13 that weren't -- didn't have fair notice that the naked

14 display of buttocks would bring them within this rule.

15 I'm not sure anything more needs to be said about that.

16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the broader point,

17 General Verrilli, isn't it, is that no matter -- even if

18 you're right that there are many non-vague applications

19 of this commission policy, that there is some amount of

20 uncertainty and ABC finds itself in that area of

21 uncertainty --

22 GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't --

23 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- because it turns out that

24 nudity -- that there really -- sometimes it's allowed as

25 to some body parts, and sometimes it's not allowed; and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
16 1 the commission hadn't really said anything about it for 2 50 years; and the length of time doesn't seem to be 3 what's indicative of anything; the kind of body part 4 doesn't seem to be, with some limits, what's indicative 5 of anything, so that ABC just didn't really know. 6 GENERAL VERRILLI: With respect, Justice 7 Kagan, I really disagree with that characterization of 8 the situation. 9 Moving to the second part of the analysis 10 here, I think it's important to take a half a step back. 11 The fact of the matter is -- and I think everybody, all 12 of us, understand this in our experience -- that nudity 13 on broadcast television is an exceedingly, exceedingly, 14 rare thing at any time of the day and certainly between 15 6:00 a.m. and 10 p.m. It is exceedingly rare, and all 16 of us from our experience know that. And the -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I'm not so sure 18 because the examples were given of -- I guess excerpts 19 from "Private Ryan" and from "Schindler's List" have 20 been on television. 21 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, that's true, Justice 22 Ginsburg. But, again, I think that's another issue 23 about where the lens is focused. There have been 24 thousands and thousands and thousands of broadcasts, and 25 the Respondents have identified four in which -- over
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 25 years, in which any nudity has been present.

17

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: They have their own

3 guidelines that generally prohibit it, don't they?

4 GENERAL VERRILLI: That's certainty true,

5 Justice Scalia. And I do think, in Reno, this Court

6 described the Carlin monologue at issue in Pacifica in

7 the following way: It said that monologue was readily

8 identifiable as indecent because it was a dramatic

9 departure from the customary norms for the broadcast

10 medium. I think the kind of nudity -- and I think if

11 one just looks at the video here and sees it, I don't -- I

12 think it's hard to disagree with the proposition that

13 that's a dramatic departure from what's the norm for

14 broadcast television.

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If they did an excerpt

16 from "Hair," could they televise that?

17 GENERAL VERRILLI: I think it would raise

18 serious questions. I think nudity is going to raise

19 very serious questions, and I think --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the -- in the opera,

21 in "The Makropulos Case," there's a scene where a woman

22 is seen nude entering a bathtub. And suppose that were

23 shown, that scene from the opera.

24 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I don't -- I think,

25 Justice Ginsburg, that in a context-based approach,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 there's not going to be perfect clarity. We recognize

18

2 that. But I do think with respect to this broadcast --

3 and that's the question before the Court, whether Fox --

4 excuse me -- whether ABC was on fair notice of whether

5 this broadcast would bring them within the rule.

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what you're saying

7 is, is that there is a public value in having a

8 particular segment of the media with different standards

9 than other segments. And forget radio. Let's just talk

10 about television. But -- you know, in the briefs, it

11 says how much -- how many cable stations there are, and

12 you, what do you call it, surf the -- you go through all

13 the channels. And it's not apparent to many people

14 which are broadcast and which are not.

15 But you're saying that there's still a

16 value, an importance, in having a higher standard or

17 different standard for broadcast media on the

18 television. Why is that, when there are so many other

19 options, and -- and when it's not apparent to many

20 viewers which of the two they're watching? Just because

21 it's an important symbol for our society that we aspire

22 to a culture that's not vulgar in -- in a very small

23 segment?

24 GENERAL VERRILLI: Two points in response to

25 that, Justice Kennedy: First, I think the Court's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 previous decision in this case goes a long way to

19

2 providing an answer, that yes, it does make a difference

3 to preserve a safe haven where, if parents want to put

4 their kids down in front of the television set at

5 8:00 p.m., they know that there's a segment of what's

6 available that -- where they're not going to have to

7 worry about whether the kids are going to get bombarded

8 with curse words or nudity. And then the reason --

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but --

10 JUSTICE KAGAN: But this goes --

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then there's -- and

12 then there's -- and then there's the chip that's

13 available.

14 GENERAL VERRILLI: Right.

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And, of course, you ask

16 your 15-year-old, or your 10-year-old, how to turn off

17 the chip. They're the only ones that know how to do it.

18 (Laughter. )

19 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, and that -- that

20 does point out the problem with the -- with the V-chip.

21 Of course, the V-chip is not new. It's been around for

22 more than a decade, and the -- the broadcasters have

23 tried to encourage uptake. The government has tried to

24 encourage uptake. It hasn't taken.

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But is your point is -- is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that the chip technology works better if you have this

20

2 differentiation between broadcast and cable media?

3 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, a different point. I

4 think the -- I want to get to what I think is the

5 fundamental point here, that whatever may be the case

6 with respect to the ability of a viewer to differentiate

7 whether something is a broadcast channel or a cable

8 channel, the reality is that broadcasters are in a

9 different position by virtue of the fact that they have

10 a license from the government that comes with this

11 enforceable public obligation that allows the government

12 to create this safe haven, and that puts them in a

13 different position.

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in a way, that's

15 circular. That's what we're here to argue about. I'm

16 asking --

17 GENERAL VERRILLI: Right.

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is there a functional,

19 a pragmatic, a practical difference between the two?

20 GENERAL VERRILLI: Is there -- well, I'm

21 sorry, Justice Kennedy. The V-chip works with both

22 broadcast and -- and cable transmissions, to the extent

23 it works. The -- what the briefs have pointed out --

24 and I would suggest in particular that the Court look at

25 the brief from the American Academy of Pediatrics, which

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
21 1 does a very thorough job in explaining the many ways in 2 which the V-chip has proven to be a deficient 3 technology. A lot of it goes to the inaccuracy and 4 incompleteness of the codes, the labels that -- that the 5 programmers put in to begin with, which have to be there 6 in order for the V-chip to decide what gets through and 7 what doesn't. 8 And I would point out in this very case, for 9 example, with respect to the -- for example, the 2003 10 Billboard Music Award broadcast with the Paris Hilton11 Nicole Richie back and forth, one would never have known 12 from the code affixed for the V-chip purpose that that 13 broadcast was going to have those kinds of words in 14 them. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: What will happen when -16 when we get to the point where -- when there are only a 17 handful of people in the entire country who are still 18 receiving television programs via the airwaves? 19 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I do think we're 20 not there now, as we've said in our brief, but -21 JUSTICE KAGAN: We're almost there, right -22 10 percent? 23 GENERAL VERRILLI: And I do -- but that I 24 think -- that really makes what I think is one of the 25 most fundamental points here, is that the broadcasters
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 want to have it both ways, right? They -- the spectrum 2 licenses they have are worth billions and billions of 3 dollars. Spectrum is staggeringly, staggeringly scarce, 4 and -- and they're sitting on an enormously valuable 5 resource which they got for free, and then they have a 6 statutory benefit of must-carry, which gets them on 7 cable systems automatically, and a further statutory 8 benefit of preferred channel placement on -- on those -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sign -- sign me up as 10 supporting Justice Kennedy's notion that this has a 11 symbolic value, just as we require a certain modicum of 12 dress for the people that attend this Court and the 13 people that attend other Federal courts. It's a 14 symbolic matter. 15 And if this is ­ if these are public airwaves, 16 the government is entitled to insist upon a certain 17 modicum of decency. I'm not sure it even has to relate 18 to juveniles, to tell you the truth. 19 GENERAL VERRILLI: And -- and we certainly 20 agree, Justice Scalia, with the point that was made in 21 the Court's previous decision in this case, that -- for 22 example, the words that are in the Fox broadcasts -23 teachers don't use those words with students. You don't 24 hear those words in churches or synagogues. There are 25 many, many contexts --

We want the King's English when -14 the very children we're talking about, when they go on 15 the street, when they -- their big brother says 16 something to them, it is -- the words that were -- the 17 expletives are in common parlance today. I mean, it 18 is -- I think that children -- that children are not 19 going to be shocked by them the way they might have been 20 a generation ago. 21 GENERAL VERRILLI: Justice Ginsburg, I think 22 something this Court said in its prior decision is -- is 23 right on the mark with respect to this issue, which is 24 it's a question of whether it's portrayed as 25 appropriate. And when it is -- it's one thing when your

24 1 13-year-old brother is saying it to you or some bully in 2 the schoolyard is saying it to you. 3 It's another when it's presented to you in 4 this medium as an appropriate means of communication. 5 That's true with respect to words, and it's also true 6 with respect to nudity. 7 If I might reserve the balance of my time. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General. 9 Mr. Phillips. 10 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS 11 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS FOX TELEVISION 12 STATIONS, INC., ET AL. 13 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 14 and may it please the Court: 15 I'd like to respond initially to some of 16 General Verrilli's general observations. First of all, 17 he talks about indecency as somehow serving as the core 18 of the overall understanding of the regulatory deal that 19 was made here. And it's difficult for me to accept that 20 notion when there was no effort whatsoever to enforce 21 the -- the standard of indecency between 1927 and 1975. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because 23 broadcasts didn't commonly have this sort of -- these 24 sorts of words or these sorts of images. 25 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, maybe, maybe not. We
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 don't know. All we know is that for a period of

25

2 50 years, nothing happened. So, the idea --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, we know.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that's right.

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, we can -- it

6 was not the case from 1927 till whenever you -- what,

7 1970-something -- that nudity commonly appeared on

8 broadcast television or the various words we're dealing

9 with here commonly appeared. So, it seems a bit much to

10 say, well, they didn't bring any cases for that period.

11 There were no cases to be brought.

12 MR. PHILLIPS: The only point I'm trying to

13 make, Chief Justice, is that if you're talking about

14 this as sort of the core understanding between the

15 parties, it simply played a fairly minor role in the

16 process through the bulk of the regulatory period we're

17 talking about. And, indeed, if you put it in context,

18 this is a statute that prohibits obscenity, profanity,

19 and indecency. And while the FCC spent a lot of time

20 writing about profanity as somehow being offended by

21 what went on in this omnibus order, the commission has

22 completely abandoned that under these circumstances.

23 JUSTICE KAGAN: But how about this,

24 Mr. Phillips: Look, you've been given a privilege, and

25 that gives the government at least somewhat more leeway

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to impose obligations on you. Not -- can't impose

26

2 everything, but at least has a bit more leeway. And

3 here we've had something that's very historically

4 grounded. We've had this for decades and decades that

5 the broadcast is -- the broadcaster is treated

6 differently.

7 It seems to work, and it -- it seems to be a

8 good thing that there is some safe haven, even if the

9 old technological bases for that safe haven don't exist

10 anymore.

11 So, why not just keep it as it is?

12 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, first of all, Justice

13 Kagan, it was important to catch the answer to your

14 question when you asked it of General Verrilli, which

15 was you're not saying that we lose all of our First

16 Amendment rights. So, clearly we retain our First

17 Amendment rights.

18 And, under those circumstances, it seems to

19 me you've got this two ways: First of all, the idea

20 that it, quote, "worked" -- it worked perfectly fine

21 from all the way up until 2001, even I would say until

22 2004, when the commission wildly changed its approach.

23 And it's only become dysfunctional since 2004 and, as we

24 sit here today, literally facing thousands and thousands

25 of ginned-up computer-generated complaints that are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
27 1 holding up literally hundreds of TV license renewals, so 2 that the whole system has come to a screeching halt 3 because of the difficulty of trying to resolve these 4 issues. 5 So, to say that the system is working well, 6 it seems to me, at least from the broadcasters' 7 perspective, is to say -- is to suggest that's just not 8 true. 9 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you want us to 10 overrule a decision of this Court, Pacifica. 11 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Alito. 12 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, as to radio, what -13 what has changed? 14 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm not here -15 JUSTICE ALITO: To justify that? Well, 16 could we hold that the policy is -- is invalid as to -17 on First Amendment grounds as to TV but not as to radio? 18 MR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely, Your Honor, 19 because there are fundamentally different media, and 20 there are different protections and the circumstances 21 are different, and the Court has recognized that media 22 have to be evaluated individually. But what has 23 happened over the 30 years with respect to the broadcast 24 side of television is a very fundamental change. Cable 25 is now equally pervasive. Cable is now equally
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 accessible to TV, satellite equally accessible to TV.

28

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that -- but that

3 -- that cuts both ways. People who want to watch

4 broadcasts where these words or expose their children to

5 broadcasts where these words are used, where there is

6 nudity, there are 800 channels where they can go for

7 that. All we're asking for, what the Government is

8 asking for, is a few channels where you can say I'm not

9 going to -- they're not going to hear the "S" word, the

10 "F" word. They're not going to see nudity. So, the

11 proliferation of other media, it seems to me, cuts

12 against you.

13 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it seems to me there

14 are two answers to that: First of all, the notion that

15 one medium operates in a certain way in the exercise of

16 its First Amendment rights can be used as an -- as an

17 explanation for taking away or for -- for restricting

18 the First Amendment rights of another medium is flatly

19 inconsistent with what this Court has said across the

20 board in the First Amendment context. You don't balance

21 off one speaker against another and give one favored

22 status and give another unfavored status.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's your

24 argument there, is that it's not a legitimate objective

25 to have a safe harbor.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, you can get a safe 2 harbor, and, indeed, there are a number of safe harbors 3 that are out there. First of all, there are a ton of 4 cable networks that are aimed exclusively at children. 5 And, you know, there are five, six, eight stations that, 6 I guarantee you, you will see -- where you'll see none 7 of that language. 8 And, second of all, it's always available to 9 the United States Government to decide to hold this -10 to create its own license for the United States to be a 11 broadcaster and to ensure that the broadcasts of the 12 United States public network exclude anything they want 13 to exclude because that's government speech and is in no 14 way restricted by what the First Amendment would 15 provide. 16 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if we rule in your 17 favor on the First Amendment grounds, what will people 18 who watch Fox be seeing between 6:00 a.m. and 19 10:00 p.m.? Are they going to be seeing a lot of people 20 parading around in the nude and a stream of expletives? 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Not under the guidelines that 22 the -- that Fox has used consistently from 10:00 p.m. 23 until 6:00 a.m. and candidly that all of the other 24 networks follow. 25 The truth is the advertisers and the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 audiences that have to be responded to by the networks

30

2 insist on some measure of restraint, not a measure

3 of restraint --

4 JUSTICE ALITO: So, what will you put on

5 that you are not able to put on now?

6 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, some of the

7 things that we could at least wonder about is "Saving

8 Private Ryan," "Catch-22," perhaps the beginning of the

9 Olympics. There's a whole slew of questions. I mean,

10 the -- and if you go beyond that and you think about

11 what speech has been chilled, the Tillman memorial

12 service is not broadcast because of fear of what's going

13 to be said there. Football games, basketball games,

14 local news events --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, suppose we

16 take that particular line. You didn't argue -- I mean,

17 Fox didn't argue -- Fox was worried about the fleeting

18 expletive policy in Golden Globe. I doubt in Golden

19 Globe, when it was before the commission, they raised

20 all these vagueness challenges to the whole 2001 policy.

21 So, why -- here you've taken a much broader

22 stance now, though you didn't before. I mean, do you

23 want to say anything about what I think is the basic

24 issue that Fox raises? We don't have to overrule

25 Pacifica. What Fox was penalized for was two women on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
31 1 television who basically used a fleeting expletive which 2 seems to be naturally part of their vocabulary. 3 (Laughter.) 4 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and we're worried 5 about small stations that cannot censor people because 6 they don't know what they're going to say. All right. 7 That was what we wrote, I think in -- in my opinion, 8 anyway. We were worried about that. 9 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Are you abandoning that 11 argument? 12 MR. PHILLIPS: No, no, no, of course not. 13 But you have to realize, Justice Breyer, that what -- I 14 mean, the Second Circuit, because it didn't have 15 available to it sort of what to do precisely with 16 Pacifica, tended to focus on the question of vagueness. 17 Vagueness was certainly an argument that we made there, 18 but -19 JUSTICE BREYER: It's an ABC argument 20 primarily, but you made that argument in the Second 21 Circuit. What I'm fishing with -- you don't have to 22 comment more, but -- is, do we have to reach that 23 argument? Except it's -24 MR. PHILLIPS: No -25 JUSTICE BREYER: -- very, very broad --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
32 1 MR. PHILLIPS: No. It's absolutely clear to 2 me that if this Court wants to say no more than we 3 decided the outer limits of the First Amendment in 4 Pacifica -5 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 6 MR. PHILLIPS: -- and it goes to the verbal 7 shock treatment that Justice Powell described in a 8 separate opinion, and this doesn't come anywhere near 9 that, and, therefore, this is beyond what the First 10 Amendment provides, the Court could clearly hold that 11 way and rule -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's not really 13 clear. I mean, if you want us to be really clear, you 14 should ask the FCC to simply outlaw any fleeting use of 15 the "F" word, the "S" word, any -- any shots of any 16 nudity in any movie, buttocks included. That would give 17 you all of the notice that you need. Why don't you 18 propose that? Boy, that's certain as can be. 19 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, our basic argument 20 would then -- I mean, obviously what you'd be taking 21 away is the vagueness argument, but that would just 22 bring you back then, Justice Scalia, to the core 23 Pacifica argument and the question of how far can the -24 how is it permissible to allow the FCC to regulate the 25 broadcast networks on standards that are fundamentally

33

2 medium that exists? I -- you know, I'd be perfectly

3 happy if they want to try to adopt those kinds of

4 standards and subject them to the strict scrutiny

5 requirements that this Court applies to every other

6 medium, because the truth is those requirements will not

7 withstand scrutiny under those particular standards.

8 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, broadcast TV is -- is

9 living on borrowed time. It's not going to be long

10 before it goes the way of vinyl records and eight-track

11 tapes.

12 MR. PHILLIPS: I hope that -- I'm sure my

13 client is not thrilled to hear you say that.

14 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, no, I'm sure.

15 (Laughter.)

16 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm sure your clients will

17 continue to make billions of dollars on their programs

18 which are -- which are transmitted by cable and by

19 satellite and by Internet. But the -- to the extent

20 that they're making money from people who are using

21 rabbit ears, that's -- that's disappearing. Do you

22 disagree with that?

23 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I -- it would be -- you

24 know, obviously not, because that's why we're not

25 uniquely accessible or uniquely pervasive.

Alderson Reporting Company

34 1 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. Well, so, why not just 2 let this die a natural death? Why do you want us to 3 intervene -4 (Laughter.) 5 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, because -- well, we 6 didn't ask you to intervene, actually. The FCC is the 7 one who asked you to intervene. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you're asking us to 9 intervene by overruling a prior precedent. 10 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'd be -- well, I think 11 once the issue is before the Court, it ought to decide 12 the First Amendment question that's presented here, and 13 the First Amendment question says what can the FCC do 14 under these circumstances? 15 It seems to me there are probably four 16 different ways you can go about it, all of which says 17 what the FCC did here is wrong. You can say Pacifica is 18 an exceedingly narrow decision. It goes to the outer 19 limits of what the First Amendment allows the FCC to do. 20 What they've done here is unconstitutional -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't the -22 MR. PHILLIPS: -- or they shouldn't do that. 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- inevitable consequence, 24 or this precise consequence that you're arguing for on 25 this fleeting expletive portion of this case, that every

35 1 celebrity or want-to-be celebrity that's interviewed can 2 feel free to use one of these -- one of these words? We 3 will just expect it as a matter of course, if you 4 prevail. Isn't that the necessary consequence of this 5 case? 6 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that they will use it, 7 perhaps. But that doesn't mean that we wouldn't 8 continue to try to bleep it out as best we could because 9 we have our own standards. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, even you did 11 in this one. You said now remember you're on 12 television, which was just, you know, giving an added 13 incentive for these vulgar comments. 14 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that was clearly not -15 I mean, from Fox's perspective, it was not scripted to 16 set it up that way. But, remember, the first -- the 17 first expletive -18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, I mean, isn't it 19 inevitable that this will happen? 20 MR. PHILLIPS: It is inevitable that -21 well, I think it's inevitable regardless that people are 22 going to continue to use language that they would 23 naturally use. So, yes, I do think you can expect on 24 cable and any other forum in which you have humans 25 speaking that this kind of language will expand.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
36 1 I don't know that it -- and it will probably 2 be the case that in some context, particularly live 3 television, which is really what's placed in jeopardy by 4 this, that you will have less live television because 5 your concern is people will continue to use this 6 language. 7 On a lot of awards shows, I think it's 8 candidly easier to go ahead and -- and bleep this. It's 9 not always -- it's not foolproof, but the stations are 10 committed to doing that. They've all got their 11 standards. And that was applied in this particular 12 case. So, while there may be some marginal increase in 13 it, if you compare it to the use of this language beyond 14 the broadcast context, it's the -- it is just the 15 narrowest of slivers of increase, Justice Kennedy. 16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that there is a 17 difference between what a person sees on broadcast 18 channels and what a person sees on basic cable? Basic 19 cable now? 20 MR. PHILLIPS: You mean, can the average 21 child understand the difference between the two? 22 JUSTICE KAGAN: In -- no, in content. Is 23 there a difference in content? Because basic cable 24 channels are not restricted by these rules, and I'm just 25 wondering whether you think that there's a difference.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Because I -- it has not been apparent to me that there

37

2 is.

3 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, in some -- I

4 think it probably depends on which -- which channels you

5 -- you look at, and even in the basic channels, but the

6 -- there's the cartoon that's significantly more adult

7 that's on the cable channels than the cartoons that you

8 might see on the -- on the Fox Television.

9 So, yes, I think there's probably a certain

10 edgierness to it, but that said, it's still clear

11 that -- that as long as you have advertising revenue

12 that drives a significant amount of the decisionmaking

13 here, you're going to have the kind of self-restraint

14 that frankly ought to cause the Court to say we should

15 no -- we no longer need to treat the broadcast medium as

16 the weak sister of -- of the media.

17 And, therefore, they ought to have the same

18 protections that everybody else has, and that they will

19 engage in the same restrained approach to these kinds of

20 issues that newspapers do. I mean, the Post doesn't run

21 the language of the case that's -- that's being argued

22 before it. Cable does. All of those media do. Because

23 there are natural restraints. You don't need the

24 Federal Communications Commission any longer to ensure

25 under these circumstances.

3 the vulgarity of cable suggests otherwise, doesn't it?

4 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm not suggesting that

5 there's -- there's some kind of wildly different

6 approach. All I'm suggesting is that there -- that, in

7 general, most people who -- who rely upon advertising

8 and have to play to a particular audience in order to

9 make their money is going to -- is going to obviously be

10 restrained.

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that depends

12 what your audience --

13 MR. PHILLIPS: At a minimum, the

14 broadcasters will be.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It depends what

16 audience you're -- you're trying to get and the

17 demographic. If you're trying to get an audience that

18 is older, maybe you will decide this is what is going to

19 attract them. They don't want sanitized language. They

20 want to hear the -- the -- all those other words. If

21 your target is a much younger audience, maybe that will

22 happen. But the idea that you're -- the problem is

23 going to go away because you're going to be good as you

24 can be, that seems an odd way to analyze First Amendment

25 problems.

Alderson Reporting Company

39 1 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, because I think it ought to 2 go -- it ought to be analyzed the exact opposite, which 3 is that -- that the obligation, the burden, rests on the 4 Federal Communications Commission and Congress to show 5 that there is a real problem that needs to be solved and 6 that this is narrowly tailored to achieve that. 7 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 9 Mr. Phillips. 10 Mr. Waxman. 11 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 12 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS ABC, INC., ET AL. 13 MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 14 please the Court: 15 When the issue is the content-based 16 regulation of speech, it is the government, not the 17 speaker, that must steer, quote, "far wide of the 18 prohibited zone." That foundational principle is 19 nowhere in evidence in the FCC's current enforcement 20 regime, which not only intrudes into the prohibited zone 21 but also enforces the indecency ban in a starkly 22 inconsistent manner. 23 A regime in which government officials 24 decide years after the fact that 7 seconds of rear 25 nudity in this particular episode of "NYPD Blue" is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 indecent, but 40 seconds of nudity including full

40

2 frontal nudity in "Catch-22" is not; that expletives in

3 a documentary about blues musicians is indecent, but

4 even more of those expletives in a fictional movie about

5 World War II is not, is constitutionally intolerable.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: People understand --

7 what you're -- have demonstrated, I think, is that the

8 context matters. People understand that, including

9 children. When they hear a bad word when someone hits

10 their thumb with a hammer, they understand that's

11 different than having an adult stand in normal

12 conversation and use the words. And it seems to me that

13 your position is saying that the government cannot

14 regulate with an understanding of what takes place in

15 the real world.

16 The government's effort is to try to

17 understand the context. That's why you get a different

18 rule in "Saving Private Ryan" than you get with Paris

19 Hilton and Nicole Richie. And what your argument seems

20 to be is they can't take context into account.

21 MR. WAXMAN: On -- quite the contrary. This

22 Court made clear, in particularly Justice Powell's

23 concurrence in Pacifica, that context is all-important.

24 And just look at this case. Despite -- and this goes

25 directly to some of these questions about nudity.

Alderson Reporting Company

1 Despite decades of denying complaints about televised

6 JUSTICE BREYER: This wasn't -- I mean, I --

7 don't know about this instance. It's called "Nude

8 Awakening." It's about the sexual awakening of a child.

9 You ran it, your client, after 10 o'clock on both

10 coasts, and they choose to run it at 9 o'clock for some

11 unknown reason in the Midwest. Maybe they thought -- I

12 don't know, whatever. But the --

13 (Laughter.)

14 MR. WAXMAN: It's not --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: But -- all right. So, my

16 point is what the FCC terribly told you to do was run it

17 1 hour later in the Midwest, just as you did on the

18 coast.

19 MR. WAXMAN: Just --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and why is that

21 not -- I'm not saying -- taking this point of view, but

22 I'm saying why isn't that just time, manner, and

23 circumstance that puts you to very little trouble and

24 allows everybody to see it and, therefore, is

25 constitutional?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
42 1 MR. WAXMAN: The -- this is not some sort of 2 obscure, unknown reason. This show was run across the 3 country in the last hour of prime time, which happens to 4 be from 9:00 to 10:00 p.m. in the Midwest and Mountain 5 Time zones. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Because you wanted to make 7 more money from it, I understand that. And maybe people 8 would have been a little bit inconvenienced, but the 9 inconvenience -- they made a judgment that looking at 10 this show is not like "Private Ryan." It's about sexual 11 awakening. They are showing a part of a nude woman. 12 The viewer is supposed to put himself in the position of 13 the boy who's seeing her, and the whole thing was 14 titillating. 15 Now, they might be wrong. There are two 16 sides to that argument. And so, I guess what you're 17 arguing is -- if I were to say, is that a reasonable 18 view? I guess I'd have to say it. But you have to 19 say much -- you're telling me I have to say much more 20 than that. 21 MR. WAXMAN: Well, number -- yes. Number 22 one, it is not a reasonable view for reasons that I'll 23 explain. It was not sexual awakening. This was the 24 portrayal in the context of a story line about the -25 the difficulties and embarrassments of blended families.

5 In any event, the commission for years had

6 been adjudicating complaints about nudity, and I -- I --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: All right.

8 MR. WAXMAN: It is simply untrue -- it is

9 simply untrue that this had never occurred before.

10 "NYPD Blue" itself was in its 10th season. The very

11 first episode, which caused a lot of media attention,

12 included a nude scene of love making. It was the

13 subject of any number of complaints.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: I see where you're going --

15 the question.

16 MR. WAXMAN: Okay.

17 JUSTICE BREYER: Which -- you haven't seen

19 you said, and you did, which I thank you.

20 MR. WAXMAN: You're welcome.

21 (Laughter.)

22 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and my question,

23 which I've been trying to get so you'd see very

24 precisely what it is, is why don't I just say, if you're

25 right, just what you said? And say this is an instance,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 case by case, in which, for the reasons, then I quote

44

2 you, that the First Amendment forbids the application of

3 the guideline to this case. In other words, what I'm

4 driving at is the basic thing that's worrying me here:

5 Does this case in front of us really call for the

6 earthshaking decision that you all have argued for in

7 the -- in the briefs?

8 And that's what I'm trying to figure out,

9 and that's why I am particularly worried about whether

10 or not this whole big argument here was presented to the

11 FCC about whether we have to reach that far. Now do you

12 see where I was trying to get?

13 MR. WAXMAN: I think so.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: All right.

15 MR. WAXMAN: And if not, I -- I hope you'll

16 tell me. First of all, the -- the -- both First

17 Amendment and Fifth Amendment issues were fully argued

18 in front of the commission, and the commission addressed

19 them in its decision in the ABC case.

20 We, of course, didn't ask the -- suggest

21 to the commission that it should no longer apply

22 Pacifica because the factual predicates for more relaxed

23 scrutiny didn't apply, as we didn't in the Second

24 Circuit, because only this Court can reconsider the

25 application of that standard. So, that's an argument

Alderson Reporting Company

1 we're making here.

Official

45

2 That argument is not necessary to resolving

3 this case, either on First or Fifth Amendment grounds.

4 This broadcast -- and particularly in light of the

5 ubiquitous V-chip, this broadcast is not actionably

6 indecent under Pacifica, number one. With respect to

7 notice or the vagueness of the application to this show,

8 clearly this was a shot out of the blue.

9 The commission cannot identify -- I

10 challenge the commission to identify a single decision

11 of the commission issued before this was broadcast in

12 2003 in which it had sanctioned any display of nudity,

13 and I'm going all the way back to 1978.

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: By "sanctioned," you mean

15 punished as -- as opposed to "blessed" sanctioned?

16 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, yes, yes. Yes, sanctioned

17 in the "ouch" sense.

18 (Laughter.)

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: How many displays -- how

20 many displays of nudity were there that -- that went

21 unsanctioned?

22 MR. WAXMAN: Well, for -- I don't -- I can't

23 tell you, but I can tell you based on --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, I mean, if there

25 are very few, it's not a very powerful argument.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I -- I think it's a 2 powerful argument. Let me explain the ones that I know 3 of. 1978, the commission's decision in WGBH, which 4 complained about scenes of explicit nudity in "Monty 5 Python's Flying Circus": Denied. "Catch-22," 6 40 seconds of nudity, including 10 seconds of full 7 frontal female nudity: Denied. 8 The four or five decisions that we -- that 9 we discuss on page 18 of our brief and that are appended 10 to the merits brief of the ABC affiliates. I can't 11 remember whether it's 12 or 16, but more than a dozen 12 episodes of "NYPD Blue" itself that included displays, 13 graphic displays, of nudity during the prior nine 14 seasons -- complained about and not adjudicated. 15 That is the backdrop against which the -16 JUSTICE BREYER: My law clerk found 17. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what you 18 found -- that's what you've got over -19 JUSTICE BREYER: My law clerk found -20 sorry. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what you've 22 got over 85 years. 23 MR. WAXMAN: Well, first of all, we don't 24 have television broadcasts over 85 years, and since 25 there were no reported decisions of any indecency
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 enforcement until Pacifica, I think it's only fair, as

47

2 you pointed out yourself, to look at what the commission

3 has been addressing.

4 They're right now -- I mean, you know, I've

5 cited the ones that are the subject of commission

6 decisions. I haven't cited the -- I haven't attempted

7 to hypothesize about all the other instances, but let's

8 just look at what's at stake here because the issue,

9 Justice Breyer, is not just notice to ABC in this case.

10 The question is whether the standards -- the

11 commission's standards as it's currently applying them

12 are so vague and capacious that they not only permit

13 arbitrary action, but they are engaging in arbitrary

14 action.

15 Right now, as -- as Mr. Phillips suggested,

16 the commission has pending before it, which it has not

17 denied for years, complaints about the opening episode

18 of the last Olympics, which included a -- a statue very

19 much like some of the statues that are here in this

20 courtroom, that had bare breasts and buttocks. It -- it

21 has refused to say that "Catch 22" -- its "Catch" ­ right

22 over here, Justice Scalia.

23 (Laughter.)

24 MR. WAXMAN: Well, there's a bare buttock

25 there, and there's a bare buttock here. And there may

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 be more that I hadn't seen. But, frankly, I had never

48

2 focused on it before. But the point --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Me neither.

4 (Laughter.)

5 MR. WAXMAN: Could -- could ABC or anybody

6 else rebroadcast the "Roots" series? Could it

7 rebroadcast "Catch-22," which the commission is now here

8 saying, oh, no, no, no, that was just our staff; that

9 wasn't us. In the "Saving Private Ryan" context, where

10 the commission did say as a commission, not actionably

11 indecent.

12 JUSTICE BREYER: But your only conclusion

13 from that is that they can't have any rule.

14 MR. WAXMAN: No.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: That their -- what is -- I

16 looked through the briefs; I don't see what you're --

17 tell me where in these briefs do you suggest what the

18 rule ought to be.

19 MR. WAXMAN: In our brief --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. All right.

21 MR. WAXMAN: -- we don't suggest what the

22 rule ought --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

24 MR. WAXMAN: -- ought to be, because (a)

25 it's not our burden; (b) it's not yours; and (c) there

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 are any number of options.

49

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we -- well, we have

3 to anticipate what the natural results or consequences

4 of our decision will be.

5 MR. WAXMAN: Sure.

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: As I understand it, the

7 same rules that we apply to obscenity for printed

8 material, under your view, would apply to television.

9 MR. WAXMAN: Well, those rules certainly

10 would apply. And before I --

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, if it's --

12 if it's not obscene, you can publish it. Period.

13 MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no, no, no. I'm not

14 suggesting that the indecency proscription in the

15 statute cannot be applied in a constitutional way. I

16 can give you four different --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought that was

18 the whole gravamen of your argument.

19 MR. WAXMAN: No. Our -- our arbitrariness

20 argument is that we now have a standard that employs

21 nonexclusive factors that use capacious, vague words

22 that can be balanced any way the commission wants to,

23 without explanation for what all the factors are.

24 JUSTICE ALITO: But isn't that inherent in

25 the context-based approach? Unless you have an approach

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that says there are certain body parts you can never

50

2 show, then aren't you going to get into -- isn't someone

3 going to be able to come up and say you had this

4 broadcast and you said that's okay; and this one, you

5 said is not okay?

6 MR. WAXMAN: It certainly is not. And I can

7 offer the Court or perhaps the commission four

8 approaches it could take to reduce the astonishing

9 vagueness of the current --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: Where are they in the

11 briefs? Can you just cite the pages where I will find

12 the alternatives to the present system that don't jump

13 obscenity alone?

14 MR. WAXMAN: I don't know the pages. Let me

15 just -- I can't remember the pages. Let me just outline

16 what I think -- four different things that could

17 ameliorate the vagueness of the current regime.

18 First of all, the FCC could revert back to

19 it's, quote, "emphatically narrow enforcement regime,"

20 which acknowledged, one, that it had to defer to

21 reasonable judgments of the broadcasters, and not

22 exercise the -- an editorial eye looking at camera

23 angles, whether something was or wasn't necessary to the

24 message. Number two --

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I'm going to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 let you get all four out. But on that, the reasonable

51

2 deference to the broadcasters, your policy was not to

3 allow people in the situation of Paris Hilton and Nicole

4 Richie to use those words.

5 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if they deferred

7 to your reasonable judgment, your friend's reasonable

8 judgment, they would sanction those.

9 MR. WAXMAN: I'm not owning Nicole Richie,

10 and I think the best answer to the Nicole Richie point

11 is that there is a scienter requirement in the statute

12 that, you know, would preclude the application to a

13 good-faith effort. But let me just --

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Go on to

15 number two.

16 MR. WAXMAN: I'll just go back. Well, no --

17 there are three parts to number one.

18 (Laughter.)

19 MR. WAXMAN: I'm not -- I'm not being --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your time's -- I

21 think you are.

22 Your time is about to expire. If you want

23 to get your four points out, you'd better move.

24 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. The first one is to

25 revert back to the prior enforcement regime that existed

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
52 1 before 2004, which deferred to reasonable judgments, was 2 restricted to material that is not momentary exposure 3 but is dwelled upon, and that, as Pacifica explained, 4 was egregious material akin to depictions of erotic 5 activity. 6 The second thing they could do is make this 7 three-factor test -- or however many factors it is -- a 8 test, not just a nonexclusive list of an infinite number 9 of factors that could or couldn't be balanced in any way 10 the commission wants to. 11 Even if it wants to leave it as factors -12 and this is number three -- it could at least identify 13 what they are and apply them consistency -- consistently 14 through adjudication that explains why one over-balances 15 the other, which it certainly did not do in this case. 16 And it also could clean up the actual form 17 of the words that it uses, referring, for example, to 18 sexually explicit or excretory activity. 19 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 21 General Verrilli, you have 4 minutes 22 remaining. 23 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B.

Alderson Reporting Company

1 Mr. Chief Justice.

53

2 First with respect to the notion of

3 self-restraint on the part of broadcasters, I think a

4 little history is in order here. The commission started

5 with the rule that came out of Pacifica. What it faced

6 in the 1980s, with that being the outer bound of the

7 commission's authority, was the explosion of the shock

8 jock phenomenon, Howard Stern and Bubba the Love Sponge

9 and the rest of it, which didn't use any of the seven

10 words in the Carlin monologue, but which was highly vile

11 and lewd, and it required the commission to make a

12 judgment. Now, that was all advertising-sponsored

13 broadcast. And so, I do think the risk of a race to the

14 bottom is real --

15 JUSTICE KAGAN: General --

16 GENERAL VERRILLI: -- and this history is

17 showing it.

18 JUSTICE KAGAN: I think that the -- that the

19 networks really are saying, well, even -- even if some

20 regulation is permissible, the kind of regulation that

21 the FCC has done here is regulation that gives it

22 complete discretion as to what kind of speech to go

23 after and what not to go after; that it has not tied

24 itself in any way to any kinds of standards. And it's,

25 you know, evident in the notion that this -- the way

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
54 1 that this policy seems to work, it's like nobody can use 2 dirty words or nudity except for Steven Spielberg -3 (Laughter.) 4 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- and that there's a lot of 5 room here for FCC enforcement on the basis of what 6 speech they think is kind of nice and proper and good. 7 And that that's a serious First Amendment issue. 8 GENERAL VERRILLI: I -- well, I disagree. 9 First, that's the lens problem again. We are talking 10 about a tiny, tiny number of the broadcasts that occur 11 in a month, much less a year, much less a decade. So, 12 the idea that there's a significant First Amendment 13 problem that encompasses a wide variety of broadcast 14 expression I just don't think comports with the facts. 15 Second, I do think if one looks at the 16 corpus of decisions that the commission has made about 17 what's indecent and what isn't, I think one can see with 18 respect to the large majority of them, the vast majority 19 of them, that it's clear which side of the line 20 something fell on. Yes, there isn't perfect clarity. 21 There are going to be some hard cases. But they really 22 have identified what is, in the great scheme of things, 23 a trivial number of hard cases. 24 I don't think one can say that this is a 25 situation like Reno in which there's effectively no
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1 standard at all. In Reno, this Court distinguished the

55

2 Pacifica situation eight ways to Sunday, and I think

3 we've identified them in our brief and those are valid.

4 I do think there's a significant problem

5 with thinking about Pacifica as the outer bound of the

6 commission's authority under the First Amendment. Of course --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though the Justices

8 involved said this is a narrow decision, both Justice

9 Stevens and Justice Powell.

10 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, and, Justice

11 Ginsburg, that's true, and the principles the commission

12 continues to apply are narrow principles. This is

13 not -- this is not something that covers a vast array of

14 speech on broadcast. It's a tiny fraction. And so --

15 and I do think if you're talking about Pacifica as the

16 outer bound, the consequences are the shock jocks are

17 fine; the Super Bowl half-time episode with Janet

18 Jackson is fine.

19 You can have as many of these 7-second

20 episodes of "NYPD Blue" as you want. That's all fine.

21 In fact, anything that's -- anything that isn't at

22 that extreme level is fine.

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And on the other side,

24 you'd better be careful about calling certain people,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 certain artists to be interviewed because, even though

56

2 it's unscripted, there's always a risk they're going to

3 say something they shouldn't say.

4 GENERAL VERRILLI: But I -- a couple answers

5 there. One is the delaying bleeping technology, Justice

6 Ginsburg, and the other one is that there is a scienter

7 requirement under the commission's enforcement authority

8 here. And so, in that situation, it seems highly

9 unlikely you would have the requisite scienter that

10 could lead to a forfeiture.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe the third is you

12 shouldn't interview these people.

13 GENERAL VERRILLI: Let me spend, if I could,

14 a minute on the "NYPD Blue" broadcast. The -- ABC

15 hinges a lot on the notion, Justice Breyer, that this is

16 a non-sexualized episode. I mean, I guess one could

17 make up one's own mind looking at the video. The

18 commission decided that that was -- it was essentially

19 voyeurism. The --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your

21 sentence, please.

22 GENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you. The little

23 boy walks into the room at the very end of that -- of

24 that segment of nudity, and I do think that fully

25 vindicates the commission's judgment with respect to the

Alderson Reporting Company

2 Thank you.
