1  P R O C E E D I N G S  2  (10:29 a.m.)  3  THE COURT:  We'll hear argument this morning  4 in Case 12751, Fifth Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer.  5  Mr. Long.  6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.  7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS  8  MR. LONG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it  9 please the Court:  10  A fiduciary's decision to do exactly what an  11 employee stock ownership plan is designed to do and what  12 the plan requires by continuing to offer employer stock  13 as an investment option is presumptively prudent.  14 Statutory language, trust law, congressional policy, and  15 practical considerations all support this result.  16  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You  you want us to say  17 that we have sort of a coach class trustee.  We're all  18 traveling in coach class when we have an ESOP.  Once  19 once we go down that road, how  how do we define what  20 the duties of the trustee are?  21  MR. LONG:  Well, we're not asking for a  22 coach class trustee.  I mean, we're  we're saying to  23 look at the statutory definition of the duty of prudence  24 in Section 1104(a)(1)(b), which says that the duty of  25 prudence must take into account the character and aims
3

Official
1 of the enterprise.  So when we talk about ESOPs, we're  2 talking about a pension plan of a very specific kind.  3 It is designed, the definition  4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This does  this plan  5 didn't require you to invest solely in employer stock,  6 did it?  7  MR. LONG:  This plan  8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It gave you the option  9 to do it and to go above the 10 percent.  But it didn't  10 require you to buy only employer stock, did it?  11  MR. LONG:  Well  well, ERISA, the statute,  12 requires that an ESOP invest primarily in employer's  13 stock.  This particular plan, like many plans, requires  14 that all of the assets in the ESOP be invested in  15 employer stock except the amount that needs to be in  16 cash for shortterm management requirements.  So  so  17 Congress both  18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you point to the  19 part of your plan that did that?  Because I looked at it  20 and I didn't see the plan requiring 100 percent  21 investment.  22  MR. LONG:  If  Your Honor, if you look at  23 page 735 of the Joint Appendix, you'll find in  in  24 part 3.3, it states, "However, in all events, the Fifth  25 Third stock fund as described shall be an investment
4

1 option."  2  And then if you look on 736 and then  3 continuing on to 737, it says that, "The funds shall be  4 invested primarily in Fifth Third stock."  It says, "It  5 may also be invested in shortterm liquid investments to  6 the extent the administrator determines they are  7 desirable to accommodate expected short run liquidity  8 needs."  9  But then it says, "The trustee shall have no  10 discretionary authority to sell Fifth Third Bancorp  11 shares or refrain from acquiring additional Fifth Third  12 Bancorp shares with funds not held for short run  13 liquidity needs."  14  So we think that  15  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You use the word  16 "primarily."  There's an allegation here that you should  17 have stopped buying stock once you understood that there  18 was a serious condition in the company.  That you've  19 breached your duty of loyalty, not of prudence.  What do  20 you do with that allegation?  21  MR. LONG:  Well, what we say is that these  22 duties  again, we're not asking for coach class  23 duties.  These are first class, if you will, duties, but  24 they have to be understood in the context of this  25 special kind of plan with special purposes.  The  the
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 purpose of an ESOP is to own company stock, to give the  2 employees a piece of the rock, an ownership interest in  3 the company.  And so when  when the issue is, as  4 you're  as you're posing it, Justice Sotomayor, at  5 what point does a duty of prudence or a duty of loyalty,  6 either one, require the trustee to break the plans of  7 the term, deviate from the plan's  8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It doesn't say you have  9 to.  It says "primarily."  It doesn't say you have to  10 continue buying.  11  MR. LONG:  Well, again, I mean, I  I  12 quoted the language.  As we read the plan, and I think  13 the government agrees with us on this, the  the  14 instructions of the plan are to invest all the money in  15 Fifth Third stock except as needed for shortterm cash  16 requirements.  17  Now, there is the duty of prudence, and  18 we're not asking for a second class duty.  But we think  19 in this context, given this special kind of plan, what  20 that duty means is can the purpose of this  21  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Long, there is no  22 presumption written into this statute.  There is an  23 exception from the diversification requirements in ESOP.  24 The whole object is to buy the company's stock, and so  25 you don't need to diversify.  But apart from that, the
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 statutory requirement on loyalty and prudence is  2 undiluted.  And so I don't know where this presumption  3 comes from.  It's not in the statute itself.  4  MR. LONG:  Well  well, we do think it  5 comes from the text of the statute.  It comes from the  6 duty of prudence itself which looks to the character and  7 aims of the plan, and then in Section 1107(d)(6), an  8 ESOP is defined in ERISA to be a plan that's designed to  9 invest primarily in the employer's own stock.  So we  10 think that defines the special character name of the  11 plans.  Congress has also spoken to this in other  12 statutory enactments  13  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Long, I think it  14  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Section 1104 of ERISA,  15 which this  this plan is not exempted from, says that  16 the fiduciaries must manage a plan, and I quote, "for  17 the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to  18 participants and their beneficiaries."  Do you  19 acknowledge that that's binding on the  20  MR. LONG:  It  it is.  And the government  21 adds the word "retirement" before benefits, and they say  22 an ESOP must be managed exclusively to provide  23 retirement benefits, but that  24  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I don't add that.  25 I'm just saying providing benefits.  I mean, that's 
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that's  2  MR. LONG:  Oh, yes.  3  JUSTICE SCALIA:   that's quite different  4 from running a plan to  to own stock in the company.  5 That's  that's not the basic purpose of it.  6  MR. LONG:  Well,  well, but,  7 Justice Scalia, plans  ERISA plans provide different  8 kinds of benefits.  The pension plans themselves can  9 provide death benefits, hardship benefits, disability  10 benefits.  So if the benefit is stock in the company, a  11 piece of the rock, you know, the duty of the fiduciary  12 is to manage that as best as it can be managed to  13 produce the largest benefit for the participants.  But  14 it's  but it's not  to go back to your question to  15 say, well, you know, it looks like some other investment  16 would be a better investment this week or this month.  17  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is there anything in the  18 trust law or the common law that allows us to define  19 benefits that way?  20  MR. LONG:  Well, I mean, I don't think we're  21 asking for a special definition of benefits.  We're just  22 saying that what this plan  and trust law does say the  23 settlor has a great deal of leeway to define the  the  24 benefits that are being provided.  This is a particular  25 kind of benefit, though, that Congress not only
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 authorized, but has strongly encouraged.  I mean,  2 employers are strongly encouraged to offer this benefit.  3  So to say that prudence or loyalty or  or  4 any of these fiduciary duties requires a sort of  5 continuous monitoring of the company to see whether  6 this is no longer such a good investment.  7  JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say the benefits  8 referred to in the  providing benefits to  9 participants, and you're saying the benefits to  10 participants is their ownership of company stock,  11 including worthless company stock.  12  MR. LONG:  Well  well, no, not at all,  13 Justice Scalia.  I mean, the  the idea is that the  14 company stock is valuable, and the hope is  15  JUSTICE SCALIA:  But when it ceases to be  16 valuable, it seems to me you're not.  17  MR. LONG:  Well, and  and we agree as  18 as every court of appeals has  has held, that has  19 looked at this, all seven, that there  there does come  20 a time when the purpose of the ESOP, of allowing the  21 employees to build an ownership stake in the company,  22 can no longer be realized because the company is in  23 serious peril, serious jeopardy.  24  JUSTICE KAGAN:  But  but there are  25 occasions, Mr. Long, outside of that very narrow
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 category of cases that you define in which the stock is  2 going to be way, way, way, overvalued relative to what  3 the fiduciaries know is the company's actual value.  4 Let's just say it  the  the market price is four  5 times more than the actual value, and the fiduciaries  6 know that because of inside information that they have.  7 It just sort of defies language to say that some  a  8 prudent person would retain the investment in that kind  9 of wildly overvalued stock, doesn't it?  10  MR. LONG:  Well, I mean, if I could take  11 that in several steps.  I mean, that material  12 overvaluation standard, which no court has ever  13 accepted, we think, is unworkable.  I mean, first of  14 all, before you get to the inside information, which I  15 think is the kernel of it that's left at the end, if you  16 have a stock that is traded on an active market, you  17 really can't tell the fiduciary, absent possibly inside  18 information, Well, you need to outsmart the market.  19  JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  But I'm talking about a  20 case in which the fiduciary has inside information  21 that  that  that enables him to know that the stock  22 price is way overvaluing the actual value of the  23 company.  24  MR. LONG:  But when you  when you get to  25 that point of the analysis, and this is what all the
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 courts have recognized, you have to then bring in  2 securities law, and you have to recognize to trade on  3 that inside information would violate securities law.  4 So prudence or loyalty cannot require a violation of  5 securities law.  6  So what  what are the other options?  You  7 could halt trading.  That would not itself violate  8 securities law.  But that could do great damage to the  9 participants if the company  if the company's own ESOP  10 said, well, we think something is so wrong that we're  11 shutting down the  12  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I  I suppose it  13 could, but a prudent manager might say that it would do  14 greater damage to the  to the participants in the plan  15 to enable this misinformation to exist and to keep  16 putting  to keep buying stock, to keep putting more  17 and more of their retirement investments into something  18 that is really overvalued.  19  MR. LONG:  Well, I mean, our point is that  20 that public announcement, that the ESOP has stopped  21 allowing purchases of company stock, could cause a sort  22 of collapse in the stock price that would be terrible  23 for the participants, and saying that prudence requires  24 that is kind of risky gamble.  25  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, you assume that
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 truthful information will out in the end, and is it  2 better to keep on putting more money into something that  3 is  is  you know, is really not a good investment  4 for the participants and the beneficiaries?  5  MR. LONG:  Well, but  but by  you know,  6 stopping immediately you could cause even greater harm.  7 But let  I think your initial question  8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what's wrong with  9 following the law and disclosing that material  10 information to the public and stopping the  the  11 employees from losing more money in worthless stock  12  MR. LONG:  And I think that's ultimate  13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   or almost worthless  14 stock?  15  MR. LONG:  That's ultimately where the  16 government comes in.  Now, we've moved a huge distance  17 from let's, you know, shut down the ESOP to let's  18 release information.  19  But there we would say, again, we think you  20 have to consider this in connection with securities law  21 that if  if you announce, well, there's this sort of  22 general duty to release information  I mean, first of  23 all, that would be quite a big change in ERISA.  24 There's  there are many specific requirements for  25 disclosure of information in ERISA.
12

1  And what the lower courts  2  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's just background  3 information for this point you're discussing.  Can  4 can you tell me, is it a very common practice for the  5 directors and officers of the company themselves to be  6 the trustees?  I had just assumed that that didn't  7 happen much anymore.  Can you just tell me, because a  8 lot of these problems would be taken care of, insider  9 information and so forth, if there was an outside  10 trustee.  And I assume  tell me if I'm wrong  that  11 the reason for the trust  for the company themselves  12 to do it is because it saves money.  It's  it's  13 cheaper than hiring an outside investment.  Maybe I'm  14 wrong about that.  But can you  15  MR. LONG:  Well, in several  16  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you just tell us what  17 the  what the landscape is?  18  MR. LONG:  First  first of all, it is  19 common.  So this  this happens quite a lot.  20  You know, second of all, this  this idea  21 of, well, we could appoint an independent trustee, would  22 not really solve all the problems because then you'd  23 have to have a monitoring trustee who would have to give  24 the independent trustee any inside information that they  25 had.
13

1  So the government's suggestion is, well,  2 okay, you'd get a lowlevel employee to be the  3 monitoring trustee.  Well, that could itself violate  4 ERISA if you had somebody so low down that they wouldn't  5 know anything, that  that also could be a violation.  6  So it's  7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, part of  8 I'm sorry.  If you want to  9  MR. LONG:  So  so it's  it's really not  10 a solution, but it is common to have the officers of the  11 company, and I think it's not just to save money.  It's  12 because it's a very important part of what the company  13 does, and they want to have their top people running it.  14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, the dilemma  15 we're talking about, which is you've got inside  16 information and if you do something with it, it's going  17 to hurt the beneficiary, I mean, isn't that just a  18 reflection of the fact that these are really bad  19 investments?  I mean, you're putting all your eggs in  20 one basket.  Your  your  your job depends on the  21 company and your  your retirement depends on the  22 company.  23  MR. LONG:  Well  24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that's why you're  25 in this awkward position of saying if the company is
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 doing something bad, you know, having inside  inside  2 information that should be disclosed because it affects  3 the stock price, then it's going to hurt not only the  4 company, but also your retirement stock.  5  MR. LONG:  Well, I mean, first of all, it's  6 quite right that an ESOP, because it's totally  7 undiversified, is not by itself a good retirement plan.  8 And we think that just confirms that the  the special  9 nature and  and aims of an ESOP is not solely for  10 retirement benefits.  11  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it is  it is a  12 purpose, Mr. Long, isn't it?  You said  you quoted the  13 statute, and the statute just says benefits.  But isn't  14 the plan  doesn't the plan itself mention retirement?  15  MR. LONG:  Oh, yes.  And  and  and the  16 hope, of course, is that these plans will produce lots  17 of retirement benefits.  The third plan, for long  18 periods of its history, has been extremely successful at  19 producing retirement benefits.  20  Our  our basic argument is, though, that  21 because of the nature of this plan, because it is linked  22 to the company's stock, and because Congress recently  23 looked at this exact issue after Enron and said, we want  24 employees to have choices, but company stock can still  25 be a choice and we actually encourage that 
15

1  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, the participants  2  MR. LONG:   but you don't shut it down as  3 soon as there's trouble.  If a company  4  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why do you need a special  5 rule for  for ESOPs?  I mean, the  the factors that  6 you mentioned, it seems to me, apply to any trustee  7 who's managing.  You say, oh, you should have sold  8 because the stock was overvalued on the  on the stock  9 market.  Well, how is the trustee supposed to know that?  10  MR. LONG:  It's  it's  11  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is he going to outguess the  12 market?  13  MR. LONG:  Right.  Absolutely.  14  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Surely you don't demand  15 that a prudent trustee outguess the market.  Okay?  So  16 if it's not the market that's overvalued, it must be  17 inside knowledge  18  MR. LONG:  Inside  19  JUSTICE SCALIA:   that causes him to know.  20  MR. LONG:  And I want to come  21  JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you have the same  22 problem about not being able to use that inside  23 knowledge.  24  MR. LONG:  You can't use it.  25  And let me come back to Justice 
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  JUSTICE SCALIA:  So  so why do we need a  2 special rule for ESOPs I'm saying?  All the points you  3 make apply to any  any kind of trustee, whether it's  4 only company stock or not.  Why do we need a special  5 rule for  for company stock operations?  6  MR. LONG:  Well, because if it were just an  7 ordinary investment  8  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  9  MR. LONG:   where the purpose really is  10 just to maximize retirement benefits  11  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  12  MR. LONG:   there you do look at the  13 riskreturn ratio and the expenses and all  14  JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  But you have the  15 same  the same  the same problems that  that you  16 justify doing nothing for the ESOP, justifies doing  17 nothing in the other  in the other plans; namely, you  18 can't expect me to  to outsmart the market, number  19 one, nor can you expect me to use my inside knowledge.  20 That violates the securities laws.  21  So those are your two points, but it seems  22 to me those points apply.  We don't have to adopt a  23 special law for this.  24  MR. LONG:  Well  well, but, again,  25 Justice Scalia, we're  we are agreeing with the lower
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 courts.  There is absolutely a duty of prudence, and we  2 don't deny that there would be a point when a prudent  3 ESOP fiduciary  4  JUSTICE KAGAN:  But even in saying that,  5 Mr. Long, you have a category where you would say the  6 duty of prudence applies, and it's this category of  7 where the company is on the verge of collapse.  8  But even there, you would face the exact  9 same securities law problems that you're  that you're  10 saying should preclude  11  MR. LONG:  Well  12  JUSTICE KAGAN:   the government's test.  13 Because there, too, you would have this kind of, I don't  14 know what to do, I'm between a rock and a hard place,  15 the securities laws prevent me from selling on inside  16 information.  The same problems apply.  17  MR. LONG:  Well, no.  What  what we're  18 saying is using public information, the chances that the  19 company is going to be able to provide employee  20 ownership for the long term may become so low that a  21 prudent fiduciary would decide to shut it down.  22  But I do  I do want to answer your  23 question on inside information because I think that's  24 the nub of it, and you raised the point of, if the  25 fiduciary actually knows the inside information, don't
18

Official
1 they have to do something, make it public.  2  We talked about the securities law problem  3 with trading on it.  The government says, Well, just  4 just make it public.  Just release it to the public.  5  There we think the problem is, first of all,  6 that that would create this new sort of general ERISA  7 duty to provide information when it's not spelled out in  8 ERISA as  you know, which has very specific  9 requirements.  But  10  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's not an ERISA  11 responsibility.  It's an SEC responsibility.  It's 10b5  12 responsibility.  Aren't you supposed to disclose any  13 information that a reasonable investor  14  MR. LONG:  And  and that's  15  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   would real  16  MR. LONG:   that's really exactly our  17 point, Justice Sotomayor.  This is  if there's inside  18 information that has to be disclosed, the securities law  19 provides a complete legal regime for this.  The  20 government even agrees that in terms of the timing of  21 disclosure, the SEC timing should govern.  22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what's  what's  23 wrong with a rule that simply says a fiduciary has to do  24 whatever it's  possible to protect beneficiaries  25 within the bounds of the law?
19

1  MR. LONG:  Well, it  it  2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so if the law  3 required you to disclose it, and you didn't, you've  4 breached your duty of prudence and of loyalty, because  5 you've protected the company  6  MR. LONG:  Well  7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   but not the  8 beneficiaries.  9  MR. LONG:  It sounds good, but I think it  10 would create serious problems.  I mean, you would have,  11 then, two sources of information about the company, the  12 ESOP fiduciary, which you would be saying would have an  13 independent duty to decide when it thinks there's been  14 some material misstatement or some inside information  15 and the company, which could create great confusion.  16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You  you don't  17 you're  you have an absolute duty to the beneficiary.  18  MR. LONG:  Well, but  but the  I guess  19 the point is, Justice Sotomayor, from the  the  20 fiduciary can say, Look, if there's been a securities  21 law violation about disclosure or material  22 misstatements, there's a securities law remedy for that,  23 and the plan participants will get that remedy.  24  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, then, what if the  25  JUSTICE ALITO:  In an ESOP  in an ESOP,
20

Alderson Reporting Company

1 can the fiduciary take into account the interests of the  2 participants as employees as opposed to their interests  3 as investors?  It doesn't seem to me that those will  4 necessarily always be the same.  And there may be  5 situations in which something that would be potentially  6 good for the participants as investors would be quite  7 bad for them as employees.  8  They want to keep their jobs.  They want the  9 company to stay afloat.  Can that properly be taken into  10 account, or is that outside of the bounds?  11  MR. LONG:  I mean, I  I don't think you  12 have to do that.  I think you  you know, you look at  13 the interest of the participants who are both employees  14 and participants in the plan, you know.  So  so I  15 don't think it's necessary to say, Well, we're not even  16 looking at them as participants in the plan.  We're  17 looking at them only as employees.  Are  we think  18  JUSTICE ALITO:  No, I'm not saying only as  19 employees, but I'm saying can you take that into account  20 at all?  If you're in the situation where stopping  21 trade  stopping purchases in company stock would be a  22 signal that would potentially trigger bankruptcy and  23 liquidation for the company, can that be taken into  24 account?  25  It might not be in the best interests  if

1 the  if the  if these participants were simply  2 investors, it might be in their best interests to stop  3 buying the stock.  But if taking that step would have  4 the consequences that I mentioned, it might be very much  5 not in their best interests as employees.  6  MR. LONG:  Well, I mean, I think I'd say  7 that that would be one way to sort of work this out.  8 It  that's another way of getting to the  the bottom  9 line that we think is correct here, which is that an  10 ESOP is a special kind of pension plan, and the whole  11 nature of it is to own company stock.  And therefore  12  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, how do you fine  13 define the standard or the duty that's responsive to  14 Justice Alito's concern?  And I had the same problem.  15  Let's assume that trustees in a nonESOPs  16 plan have a duty to maximize returns and provide stable  17 investments.  Is it somehow different when it's an ESOP?  18  MR. LONG:  Yes, I  I think it is.  If  19 there's  20  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if so, what is the  21 duty?  22  MR. LONG:  The  I think the  23  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How do you define it?  24  MR. LONG:  I think the  the duty is to  25 maximize the returns for this special kind of a vehicle,
22

1 which is a vehicle that owns stock in only one company,  2 the  the employee's company, and for reasons that  3 this kind of goes to  to Justice Alito's point but in  4 a different way  for reasons that go beyond just the  5 returns.  6  It's  it is because it is the  the  7 employees' company.  Congress thought it was beneficial  8 for many reasons to encourage employee ownership of  9 companies, and so you don't look to whether, you know,  10 this appears to be a bad investment as compared to a  11 mutual fund.  12  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if I'm the trustee,  13 I don't know what my duty is based on your answer.  I  14 don't know what I'm supposed to do.  15  MR. LONG:  Well, I mean, the courts of  16 appeals have had a fairly uniform approach to this for  17 now almost 20 years, and it has  it has not been  18 causing a great deal of  of trouble.  The approach  19 they've all been taking is that because of the special  20 nature of ESOPs and, you know, when the plan requires  21 that all the funds be invested in the ESOP at least,  22 that's what the fiduciary must do, and that is  23 presumptively prudent.  24  It's not necessarily prudent, and there  25 would be, you know  the way we think the Courts have
23

Alderson Reporting Company

1 best expressed it, if  and they draw this from trust  2 law  if the special aims of this plan, employee  3 ownership, can no longer reasonably be achieved, then  4 prudence requires the plan to be shut down.  That is not  5 a brightline standard, but that is the standard  6 the courts have adopted.  7  I'd like to save the balance of my time, if  8 I may.  9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Long.  10  Mr. Mann.  11  ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD MANN  12  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS  13  MR. MANN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and  14 may it please the Court:  15  I think what I can most usefully do is talk  16 first about the question of the relevant benefits that  17 was raised by some of you, and then second address this  18 socalled "rock and a hard place" problem which we think  19 is essentially a confession of disloyalty by my most  20 able opposing counsel.  21  First, the nature of the benefits in the  22 statute, the reference to benefits in 404(a)(2)(A) is  23 quite plain.  It refers to the basic type of plan that's  24 covered by ERISA, which is an employee benefit plan as  25 defined in Section 1002 sub 3 
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official 1  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Mann, I think it would help if you  2 raised the podium a bit so you're closer to the microphone.  3  MR. MANN:  Section 1002, Sub 3 describes  4  employee benefit plans, which are the subject of ERISA.  5  And there are two types of employee benefit plans as  6  defined in that section.  There are plans that provide  7  welfare benefits and plans that provide pension  8  benefits.  And I think there is no doubt that the  9  benefits that must be the exclusive purpose of an ERISA plan  10  are those benefits that are required to be governed by  11  ERISA.  12  And I think we need to remember the grand  13  bargain of ERISA, reflection of the statute is, if  14  employers are going to provide these kinds of benefits,  15  the people that manage the retirement and welfare plans  16  must accept fiduciary duties.  That's the bargain of  17  ERISA.  If you are going to provide these kinds of  18  benefits, you have to accept fiduciary duties.  19  And the sole purpose of the plan under the  20  statute is to provide those benefits.  21  Now, I'd like to talk about this idea of  22  this "rock and a hard place" that was first raised by  23  Justice Kagan.  24  I think that the best way to think about  25  this is, essentially, what the petitioners are saying
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  is, if I decide to put myself in a position where I owe  2  duties to two different people, my employer on the one  3  hand and the beneficiaries of the plan, because I've put  4  myself in a conflicted situation, it's perfectly right  5  for me to just do nothing.  6  That's not the way it works.  You can  7  imagine a lawyer that undertakes to represent two  8  clients with conflicting interests.  If it comes to the  9  point where the interests are in conflict, well, the  10  lawyer has already made a mistake.  The lawyer cannot  11  simply say, well, I choose to protect one client, not  12  the other.  They have to be something, and they're going  13  to violate some  14  JUSTICE BREYER:  I would say that  well,  15  what the problem  but can you give me any example of  16  any case?  There may be so many you can't even give me  17  your best one.  But trusts have been around for probably  18  800 years.  And can you give me an example of one where  19  a court said a trustee has breached its fiduciary  20  obligation because he failed to use inside information?  21  MR. MANN:  Oh, no, I  I think there  22  probably isn't such a case, but I would  23  JUSTICE BREYER:  You think there is not such  24  a case?  25  MR. MANN:  I think there probably is not
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  such a case.  The court of appeal  2  JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine.  If there is not such  3  a case, what's the problem?  Because what's the rock and  4  the hard place?  5  MR. MANN:  Well, the  6  JUSTICE BREYER:  The person has an  7  obligation to act prudently in respect to the  8  fiduciaries  to the beneficiaries, of course.  But he  9  cannot, irrespective of that, have an obligation to use  10  inside information.  End of the matter.  What  what's  11  wrong with saying just that?  12  MR. MANN:  I  I'm not sure what you mean  13  by that, but I'd like to  14  JUSTICE BREYER:  What I mean by it is just  15  what I said.  There is no rule of trust or ERISA law  16  that you can breach a duty to a beneficiary by failing  17  to use inside information, period.  I don't know what  18  the SEC's brief is.  I'm going to ask  19  MR. MANN:  I think I  20  JUSTICE BREYER:   the SG what their  21  opinion is because they don't seem to appear on this  22  brief.  23  MR. MANN:  I think I would respectfully  24  disagree with that, and I think it's important to  25  understand why, Justice Breyer and Justice Kagan.
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  JUSTICE BREYER:  The answer is there's not  2  been a case ever holding the contrary  3  MR. MANN:  But that's  4  JUSTICE BREYER:   but you yourself  5  disagree with it.  6  MR. MANN:  But that is  7  JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, what the reason you  8  disagree with it?  9  MR. MANN:  That is because the courts of  10  appeals unanimously, as Mr. Long says, have held that  11  the trustees of these plans have no duties at all.  And  12  so if trustees have no duties at all, it's of course  13  quite difficult for them to breach the duties.  Now,  14  my  15  JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm sorry.  I'm saying go  16  back to England.  There are many cases where settlors  17  have said what kinds of things you should invest in, and  18  they invest in them.  They have inside information that  19  it is a bad investment.  Is there any case that says  20  they have a duty of obligation not to do what the  21  settlor says?  I wouldn't have been surprised if you had  22  found some cases, but I'm also not surprised that there  23  aren't any.  That's why I asked the question.  24  MR. MANN:  With respect to that particular  25  question, and I  I did not understand your question
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  that way, and I don't  I can't say whether there is or  2  has never been such a case.  3  But what's important from our perspective is  4  the trustees in this case undertook to represent  5  conflicting interests.  Ordinarily when people undertake  6  to represent conflicting interests  7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let me just continue to  8  Justice Breyer's question.  There are some legal duties.  9  I don't know of a trustee who has to break the law.  10  They can't sell on the basis of inside information, and  11  that's a legal prohibition.  12  MR. MANN:  I think that's clearly true, but  13  I think they, at the same time, at their peril, breach  14  their duties of loyalty to those for whom they've  15  accepted a fiduciary duty.  And the  16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So your claim rises and  17  falls on the fact that you think they're  they've  18  breached their duty of loyalty by having the inside  19  information and  or exactly what is your claim?  What  20  could they have done that wouldn't breach the law?  21  MR. MANN:  My claim does not rise or fall at  22  all on that.  And I don't think there is any reason why  23  you need to address that, given the particular nature of  24  the complaint.  The complaint in this case alleges that  25  the trustees knew or would have known, if they had
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  undertaken a reasonable investigation of the type that  2  is required by ordinary principles of prudence, that the  3  stock was materially overvalued, and the stock was a  4  much more risky investment than it was at the time that  5  the plan was designed.  6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How would they  7  JUSTICE ALITO:  What do they have to do  8  then?  You said they can't sell the stock based on that  9  information.  What are they supposed to do?  Or is it  10  your argument that they just never  you never should  11  have insiders serving as trustees; you always have to  12  have an outside running these ESOPs?  13  MR. MANN:  Well, I wouldn't say that you  14  always have to, but I do think that the situation is  15  quite parallel to the situation that corporate directors  16  face when they come into a conflicted situation.  In the  17  corporate context where directors ordinarily are  18  protected by the business judgment rule, if a situation  19  arises in which their interests patently diverge from  20  the interests of the shareholders, they don't simply  21  decide to represent both interests but pick one over the  22  other.  They instead step aside and appoint  and, you  23  know, allow independent people to represent the  24  shareholders.  25  JUSTICE ALITO:  So you're basically saying
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  that if it's not flatly prohibited, it is very unwise.  2  It generally shouldn't happen.  You're putting yourself  3  in an impossible position if you are an insider and  4  you're going to serve as the trustee of an ESOP.  5  MR. MANN:  Well, I think it's a plain  6  implication of Justice Kennedy's opinion in Glenn and  7  the majority opinion in Glenn that the structure of the  8  fiduciary and the relationship to the trust being  9  conflicted should raise a red flag.  10  JUSTICE BREYER:  Here when you say  I am  11  totally with you on this.  We walk into the trustee's  12  office.  It's like Ralph Nader investigating the FTC  13  years ago.  There is someone asleep on the sofa.  In his  14  inbox is ten feet of papers telling him about all  15  public  telling him about the corporation's condition.  16  It's apparent he's never read them.  If he had read  17  them, he would have taken action.  Of course you would  18  have a case, I would think.  19  MR. MANN:  But that is our complaint.  20  JUSTICE BREYER:  But you want to go beyond  21  that?  22  MR. MANN:  No.  Our complaint is they have  23  the information in step one.  They didn't do anything.  24  Step one, they did not  25  JUSTICE BREYER:  Not just information.
31

Alderson Reporting Company

1  Remember I carefully said all this was publicly  2  available information.  You want to say it also applies  3  when it's not publicly available information.  Am I  4  right or wrong?  5  MR. MANN:  You are correct.  I would also like to  6  say that, but I would like to point out our complaint  7  alleges a large amount of information that is one,  8  public; two, false information promulgated by the  9  petitioners, the falsity of which perhaps could have  10  been undertaken by  discovered by considerable  11  investigation.  12  And instead of conducting a reasonable  13  investigation that a trustee for a billion dollar  14  pension plan ordinarily would conduct  and just to be  15  clear for the earlier discussion, this is not a plan  16  that is invested solely in Fifth Third stock.  This plan  17  has a variety of investments.  There is one particular  18  fund that has 1 to $200 million  19  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose you were a  20  legislature or a congressman.  You are absolutely  21  committed to the idea that it's important and salutary  22  to have employees own stock in the company for which  23  they work.  How would you write the statute?  24  MR. MANN:  I think Congress has done a great  25  job of writing the statute.  Congress wrote a
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  statute that tells employers you can set up these plans,  2  and the trustees don't have to diversify, which is  3  inherent in having a plan that has employee stock  4  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, once you say the  5  trustee doesn't have the duty to diversify, it seems to  6  me you are living in something of a different world.  7  MR. MANN:  I think that's right.  And that's  8  why we believe that this standard of prudence is  9  affected by the fact that it's an employee stock  10  ownership plan rather than just a portion of the fund  11  that owes employers' stock.  But that doesn't mean that  12  there's no duty of loyalty.  It shouldn't affect that at  13  all.  14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but affected  15  is not quite enough.  I mean, this trustee's job is to  16  buy the company's stock.  In that particular fund, it's  17  100 percent, other than the money you need to buy and  18  sell.  So he has the easiest job in the world.  He gets  19  up in the morning and says, "I think I will buy some of  20  this company's stock."  21  (Laughter.)  22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's what he's  23  supposed to do.  And I think that what every Court of  24  Appeals has recognized is that that is by definition  25  prudent, because that is the settlor's objective with
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  one exception.  If everything is going, you know, south  2  and the company's collapsing, well, then he does have  3  the obligation to do something.  4  So I don't understand how you keep  can  5  say that he has breached a fiduciary duty of prudence  6  when the people investing in this ought to know what  7  they're going to get is the company's stock.  8  MR. MANN:  I think it's  I'm glad that you  9  asked that question, because I think that's central at  10  the disagreement between respondents and petitioners.  11  Now, the first answer, of course, is that  12  you can't look at the statute without thinking that  13  Congress had a different understanding of the duties.  14  And if I just could just mention a couple of things  15  about the statute.  It's not only the point that Justice  16  Scalia made that Section 404(a)(2) specifically carves  17  out some duties but not others.  18  It's also that it only forgives prudence to  19  the extent of diversification, which means that prudence  20  has to mean something other than diversification.  And  21  then it still further limits the scope of forgiveness.  22  It only forgives it with respect to the acquisition or  23  holding of qualifying employee securities  employer  24  securities, which is much narrower than the fiduciary  25  duty defined in Section 403 to manage and control the
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  assets of the plan.  2  But what's important for our purpose is, it  3  would not  if you ask the question, although the  4  statute resolves it, it would not have been sensible for  5  Congress to tell the people that manage employer stock  6  ownership plans that they have no duties of prudence or  7  loyalty to the employers whose retirement funds are at  8  stake.  9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what is  10  exactly the duty of prudence?  Presumably, you buy  11  you invest the funds in the company's stock, whether  12  it's going up or going down, right?  If you have the  13  funds, all you can do is invest them.  The stock is down  14  half a point or whatever.  You still buy it, right?  15  MR. MANN:  Okay.  So I'd like to say, first,  16  there is the duty of loyalty.  And it does breach the  17  duty of loyalty, for example, as the Court said in  18  Varity, and I don't think it's controversial, to lie to  19  the beneficiaries.  20  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what's the  21  answer to my question?  22  MR. MANN:  With respect to the duty  so  23  the duty of loyalty is enough to sustain  24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  I didn't  25  ask a question about the duty of loyalty.
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  MR. MANN:  With respect to  2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I asked a question  3  of whether or not the trustee is imprudent because he  4  buys the stock because it's gone down  you know, gone  5  down 10 percent.  6  MR. MANN:  Okay.  The most fundamental thing  7  about the duty of prudence that you would get from your  8  statement of trust is that the outcome of the investment  9  is not what's relevant.  What's relevant is, and Justice  10  Scalia when he was on the D.C. Circuit wrote a long  11  opinion in Fink, which discusses in detail, and you'd  12  see the same thing in the comments to Section 90 of the  13  restatement, the most important thing is what you might  14  call procedural prudence.  Okay.  These people are  15  managing a fund of $1 billion.  The relevant question is  16  what would a reasonable trustee of a billiondollar fund  17  have done to investigate the situation?  Would someone  18  with a billiondollar fund and 100 to $200 million of  19  Fifth Third stock have routinely been collecting  20  information about the nature of that investment, whether  21  they should take some action?  22  It well might be  it well might be that  23  they should not in a flighty or haphazard way dispose of  24  the stock, because that's the baseline of this plan, is  25  to invest in the stock.  But that's entirely different
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  from doing absolutely nothing, not telling the employers  2  information  3  JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think the trustee has  4  a duty to acquire inside information?  The trustees say,  5  I don't want to know insider information.  I'm going to  6  put myself in exactly the position of an outside  7  trustee, so I'm going to take into account only public  8  information, I'm not going to do an investigation.  9  MR. MANN:  Our position is that the duty of  10  the trustee is to behave as a prudent fiduciary would  11  behave, and if the trustee is unable to do that because  12  the trustee has conflicting interests to serve, then the  13  trustee is violating the duty of loyalty and should  14  arrange the situation differently.  15  JUSTICE ALITO:  What's the answer to my  16  question?  Assuming that  17  MR. MANN:  The answer to your question  18  JUSTICE ALITO:   permissible for an  19  insider to be in this position, can the insider behave  20  like an outsider?  21  MR. MANN:  I think it's plain in the case  22  that if the trustee does not undertake the investigation  23  that a prudent fiduciary would take, because of their  24  concern about acquiring insider information of the  25  employer, then they would violate the ordinary standard
37

1  of prudence.  2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, can we talk  3  concretely instead of just saying, well, they've got to  4  do what a prudent fiduciary can do?  Are they allowed to  5  take into account the impact of a decision to stop  6  buying on the beneficiaries?  The stock is going down,  7  if the trustee stops buying, that's going to cause a  8  drop in the value of the shares and that's going to hurt  9  the beneficiaries.  So what does he do?  Does he say, I  10  shouldn't buy any more because I think it's going to go  11  down some more?  Or should he say, I should keep buying  12  because otherwise all of the holdings, and this is all  13  they are invested in, their holdings are going to go  14  down?  15  MR. MANN:  I think the obligation of the  16  fiduciary at all times is to behave prudently in  17  managing investment prudently.

1  back up, in which case, we  2  JUSTICE BREYER:  In a way, what happens is  3  that the trustee, knowing that the company has announced  4  an enormous oil strike, is having to sit on a private  5  meeting where three people come in and you say, yeah,  6  there was an oil strike, but it's impossible to get the  7  oil out.  Ha, ha, we put one over on that time.  Okay.  8  MR. MANN:  If the  9  JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, what's that trustee  10  supposed to do?  11  MR.

MANN:  Okay.  15  JUSTICE BREYER:  He alone, when two other  16  people, know that this oil is worthless.  The market  17  doesn't.  It's totally inside information.  What, in  18  your opinion, is he supposed to do?  19  MR. MANN:  I believe that the trustee  20  violates the duty of loyalty and the duty of prudence if  21  the trustee, believing that the stock is overvalued, in  22  fact, does not take action to protect the beneficiaries.  23  JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So your answer is,  24  totally inside information, he sells, right?  25  MR. MANN:  I didn't say that.  I think he
39

You have the company stock.  5  By comparing it with other stocks, there will be many  6  investments that are just as good or better.  When does  7  he have to make the investment, in other words, just as  8  good or better?  I don't understand.  I don't understand  9  what  how we're going to implement what Congress  10  wanted to implement.  11  MR. MANN:  Well, we believe that the  12  traditional fiduciary standard is not that hard to  13  implement.  It's a standard that's been imposed on  14  fiduciaries for centuries.  It's a standard that all  15  managers of trusts have undertaken.  The only thing  16  that's really different about these particular trustees  17  is that they're managing funds that are worth, you know,  18  billions of dollars.  19  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Mann, you said you were going  20  to deal with the rock and a hard place.But it's been put to you that if  21 the  22  trustee goes out and sells, that would be a signal that  23  things are bad with the company.  So it will end up  24  being worse for the beneficiaries of the plan.  25  MR. MANN:  We certainly believe that if the  26  trustee's view, based on the information, is that

1  selling the stock would be bad for the beneficiaries, 

2  then a decision not to sell is prudent.  If the trustee

4  we're not going to sell, that is a prudent decision.  It 

5  might be right.  It might be wrong.  But if that's their 

6  decision, I think that's prudent.  If a trustee decides 

7  selling would be beneficial to the beneficiaries, it 

8  might be right, it might be wrong, but if that's what 

9  they actively decide, then I think they need to do 

10  something.  And that's our position. 

11  Now, the rock and the hard place, I 

12  understand that some of the Justices have disagreed. 

13  But I mean, our position on that is quite clear.  The 

14  only reason petitioners are between a rock and a hard 

15  place is they have undertaken to have interests that 

16  directly conflict with their fiduciary obligation to 

17  these employees' retirement benefits.  There is nothing 

18  in the statute.  There is no practical consideration 

19  that petitioners have suggested.  There is no reason 

20  that these funds need to be managed by insiders.  As far 

21  as we 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What about the argument  so you have 

23 outside trustees, they have to get information from the insider 

24  and if they get the information from an insider we're back in the same 

25 place. 

26  MR. MANN: 

Well, of course, if you wait

41

Alderson Reporting Company

1  until you are in possession of information and you know  2  the stock is overvalued, you can't solve the problem by  3  stepping aside then.  But if you set up the trust in the  4  hands of an independent investment manager in the  5  beginning, we believe that if you look carefully to  6  provisions of Section 1105(c) and (d), you will see that  7  Congress has provided a great deal of protection for the  8  person it appoints.  Of course, it's true that if the  9  person in the company that appoints a fiduciary knows  10  that there is a breach of fiduciary duty by the  11  investment manager, they're still liable.  But what else  12  could Congress possibly say?  Congress couldn't write a  13  statute that says people that knowingly breach fiduciary  14  duties of the employees are not supposed to be liable,  15  so  16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The status of the  17  trustee, whether it's an interested party or a  18  disinterested fiduciary, is disclosed to the  19  beneficiaries, I take it, at the outset?  They can  20  decide that they don't want to invest in that particular  21  fund and there are nine other options because of that  22  potential conflict?  23  MR. MANN:  Yes, they are advised of that.  24  Their ability not to invest in that particular fund is  25  limited during the class period because all of the
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  matching contributions for all of the class period went  2  directly into this fund.  So employees would have to  3  take that active step to remove them from the fund.  4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If they wanted  5 they got four percent matching funds if  6  they were in that fund?  7  MR. MANN:  That is correct.  8  I think the most important thing for us to  9  emphasize is the point of ERISA is that if an employer  10  is going to provide employee benefits, the people that  11  manage those benefits have to accept fiduciary duties.  12  There is nothing unusual about that.  The standard is  13  not unworkable.  It's a standard that is provided for  14  centuries.  And if the only reason that the people  15  managing the fund can't comply with those duties is  16  because they have obligations to the employers, then  17  that is not something that ERISA can tolerate.  18  Thank you.  19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.  20  Mr. Kneedler.  21  ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER  22  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,  23  AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS  24  MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it  25  please the Court:
43

Alderson Reporting Company

1  Several points at the outset.  Justice Alito  2  asked about taking into account the interests of  3  employees as employees.  But Section 1104 speaks in  4  terms of operating the plan for the exclusive purpose of  5  providing benefits to participants and their  6  beneficiaries, which means the interests of employees  7  are taken into account only insofar as they are  8  participants in the plan, not more generally.  9  And the second and related point I would  10  like to make with respect to that is the use of the word  11  "benefits" in 1104(a) that says that the plan must be  12  operated for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits  13  to participants.  We have that on page 6(a) of our  14  petition appendix.  Further up on that is the definition  15  in 1234 of an individual account plan, which  16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Kneedler, a stock  17  drop in and of itself, I don't think, can prove a lack  18  of prudence because  19  MR. KNEEDLER:  Agree.  20  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You agree with that?  21  MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, we do.  I mean, there  22  are situations in which there may be additional unusual  23  circumstances, but simply a stock drop would not.  But I  24  think that, as Justice Scalia pointed out, that would  25  also be true in a diversified plan.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.  It's true  2  almost anywhere because you can't outsmart the market.  3  MR. KNEEDLER:  At least we're not  4  insisting that a fiduciary in order to be prudent  5  must  6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how do you deal with  7  what has been vexing us, the issue of what a fiduciary  8  should or can do when they are an insider and have only  9  inside information, not public information?  10  MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So where is the breach  12  of fiduciary duty?  Where's the breach of loyalty?  What  13  can it consist of, and what does someone have to prove  14  in a complaint?  Because this has to do with a pleading  15  presumption and a merits presumption.  16  MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  And if there is a  17  substantive principle here, that would have to be  18  pleaded.  If it is an evidentiary presumption, as the  19  Sixth Circuit said, that would not have to be pleaded in  20  the complaint.  21  But several points on that.  First of all,  22  in response to Justice Breyer's question about inside  23  information, we would point out on page 31 of our brief,  24  quoting Scott, that if a fiduciary has peculiar  25  knowledge about a corporation's stock's value, that is a
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  factor to be taken into account in terms of the way the  2  trustee exercises his responsibility.  3  JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, the  the union  4  brief says the thing to do in that situation is, without  5  saying anything, turn the trusteeship over to a person  6  who doesn't have that knowledge.  That takes care of the  7  problem.  And the reason I raised the question, of  8  course, is there are trillions of dollars probably  9  managed by ERISA funds.  I don't know what percentage of  10  those involve stocks.  Not this kind  of this kind.  11  Maybe you know, but my guess is a lot.  12  And obviously, before I wrote a word that  13  said what you have to do or don't have to do with inside  14  information, I would like to know directly, not  15  indirectly, what the SEC thinks.  16  MR. KNEEDLER:  Well  17  JUSTICE BREYER:  And maybe you can tell me.  18  But the SEC isn't here.  And at least there's no SEC  19  lawyer that signed your brief.  So I don't know the  20  extent to which that's  21  MR. KNEEDLER:  I mean, this is primarily a  22  labor case.  The security  23  JUSTICE BREYER:  It might be you might have  24  a good reason for it.  25  MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  JUSTICE BREYER:  But right now I am supposed  2  to write some words or join some words.  3  MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  4  JUSTICE BREYER:  And those words will tell  5  trustees of possibly  I have no idea  but maybe  6  hundreds of billions, or maybe billions anyway, of  of  7  assets in the stock market, what they're supposed to do  8  when they learn some inside information that affects the  9  company's stock.  And I hate to tell you, I don't know  10  anything in this area about what the likely effects are.  11  And, therefore, I'd like to know what they think.  And  12  the closest I came to it was the AFLCIO brief, frankly,  13  where they said what you're supposed to do here is  is  14  turn this over.  So what do I do?  15  MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, that is, of course, one  16  option if  if circumstances get very bad.  This was  17  true in the WR Grace situation.  The trustee  the  18  inside trustees appointed an outside trustee to do an  19  evaluation.  But the first  the first step that  20  that Mr. Mann pointed out is, I think, a fundamental one  21  that should not be overlooked here.  And that is that  22  the fiduciaries have an obligation to actually exercise  23  their discretion and actually investigate.  And here,  24  the allegation is that these trustees did not even do  25  that.  So if you're going to be giving deference to a
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  trustee under  2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Investigate  3  what, the nonpublic information?  Investigate  4  MR. KNEEDLER:  Investigate  investigate  5  the consequences of the nonpublic  this would be true  6  of public information, too, that the  this is not  a  7  plan like this, even though it is exempt from  from  8  requirements of diversification, there are still prudence  9  duties, which include investigation and  and  10  monitoring of the  of the investment.  So the  the  11  fiduciaries of a plan like this do have an ongoing  12  obligation to investigate and to keep themselves  13  apprised of how the company is doing.  14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what exactly,  15  concrete terms, what do you do as the trustee?  You have  16  this information, inside information that says that the  17  stock is overvalued.  Do you sell?  In which case the  18  beneficiaries' holdings go way down and they sue you, or  19  do you not sell?  In which case when the information  20  comes out, the beneficiaries sue you because their value  21  goes down.  What are you supposed to do?  22  MR. KNEEDLER:  In  in the category of  23  cases we're talking about here, and these are the ones  24  that are of the greatest concern to the Department of  25  Labor, the stock is materially overvalued because of the
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  inside information.  In that situation  and I think  2  this is the point Justice Kagan was making  it  3  would  it would ordinarily be the right thing to do to  4  sell, the truth will out eventually.  But  and there  5  may be  there may be a precipitous drop.  But the  6  stock has already been at a  at a level and  and  7  stock has already been purchased at an inflated level,  8  which means that the employees are not getting what they  9  were entitled to.  10  JUSTICE ALITO:  But you say they should sell  11  based on the inside information?  12  MR. KNEEDLER:  No, he can't  he can't sell  13  on the basis of inside information.  He could  I'm  14  sorry, he could stop purchasing, which is  15  JUSTICE BREYER:  But the market will see  16  through that in about two seconds.  But the  17  MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, no, this is the  18  JUSTICE BREYER:  That isn't really my  19  question.  It's a numerical question.  What  you know,  20  I was making up numbers wildly.  What are the actual  21  numbers?  That is, approximately how much in assets is  22  accounted for by ownership of the company's  you know,  23  this kind of a plan where you buy the company's stock.  24  Do you know?  25  MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't know the amount of
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  assets, but  2  JUSTICE BREYER:  About?  3  MR. KNEEDLER:   as I  as I recall, I  4  think there are perhaps 12 or 14,000 ESOP plans.  5  Some  about half the employees covered are in publicly  6  traded  in publicly traded corporations.  7  I want to make another point in terms of the  8  purposes of an ESOP.  The  Congress has provided for  9  investment in  in employer stock, but it has not  10  excepted the fiduciaries from the general duty of  of  11  prudence.  The statute  the statute makes that clear.  12  And in 2006, Congress provided that employees of  13  publicly traded companies must be given the right to  14  diversify, which reflects the judgment  15  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But your  your argument,  16  at least according to the Petitioners's brief, and I  17  think they're correct, you go away from the purity  18  standard.  You have your own standard whether or not  19  it's materially overvalued in this instance.  Or are you  20  saying  21  MR. KNEEDLER:  For inside  where there's  22  inside information and is it  is it materially  23  overvalued.  And there could  there can  24  be circumstances  25  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But  but then  but
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1  then you are creating a special standard which is just 

2  what you're accusing the Petitioners of doing. 

3  MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, the question is what's 

4  the general standard of prudence.  And it would always 

5  be imprudent for a diversified or nondiversified plan 

6  for the fiduciaries to purchase a  an asset that 

7  they  or hold on to an asset that they know to be 

8  or should know with reasonable investigation is 

9  materially overvalued. 

10  JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, let me give you  I'll give you this 

11  example.  It's helpful to have something concrete here 

12  and not just general statements of  of  about 

13  fiduciary duty. 

14  Let's say that the trustee receives inside 

15  information that someone has alleged that corporate 

16  office  a particular corporate officer has engaged in 

17  illegal conduct.  And if it turns out that that conduct 

18  actually took place, that  that information  that 

19  will cause damage to the company.  But it's  it's 

20  it hasn't been proven.  There's simply been an 

21  allegation. 

22  Now, what  at that point, what does the 

23  trustee  what do you think the trustee has to do?  If 

24  that information were available to the public, let's say 

25  it would cause the price of the stock to go down, so

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  it's material  it's material information, but at a  2  somewhat preliminary stage.  What do you do?  Completely  3  stop buying the stock?  You can't sell.  Disclose the  4  information?  What is supposed to be done?  5  MR. KNEEDLER:  There is no absolute answer  6  in that situation.  Stopping buying might be the right  7  approach.  That's not uncommon, and there are blackout  8  periods where  where plans in companies bar trading in  9  the stock.  But if it's material information that the  10  securities laws require to be disclosed, there is no  11  reason why the participants in an ERISA plan should be  12  unprotected when that material information affects  13  the  14  JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's  no.  But  15  but would that information have to be disclosed under  16  the securities laws?  Let's say there was no prior  no  17  prior misleading statement regarding this matter.  18  MR. KNEEDLER:  It would have to be  19  disclosed.  20  JUSTICE ALITO:  Eventually.  21  MR. KNEEDLER:  If it's major, it might have  22  to be disclosed within 4 days under  under 8(k).  23  Otherwise, it would be quarterly or annually.  And we  24  are  we are suggesting that the  that disclosure  25  obligations should be geared to what the securities law
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  provides  2  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The Chief Justice  3  indicated I can ask just one question.  Is this a  4  case in which we must decide what the fiduciary standard  5  is quite without regard to inside information?  Is  6  inside information just an added issue in the case or is  7  it the key issue in the case?  8  MR. KNEEDLER:  We think in this case it  9  is  it is the key issue.  The Court does not have to  10  decide what fiduciary obligations the fiduciary of an  11  ESOP would have in  in dire circumstances where the  12  where you have a failing company or mismanagement or  13  something like that.  We are focused here on inside  14  information that materially enhances the value of the  15  stock, overvalues it, and in that situation, we think  16  that a fiduciary of an ESOP, just like the fiduciary of  17  any other plan, has a  has a duty of prudence not to  18  remain invested in or to purchase materially overvalued  19  stock.  20  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.  21  Mr. Long, you have five minutes.  22  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A.

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  employee stock plans, and we think really that's the  2  key, are all of the Courts of Appeals considering many  3  cases, you know, with many different fact patterns have  4  not disagreed.  There is no circuit split on the issue  5  that we've spent all our time discussing this morning.  6  The only circuit split is on whether this presumption  7  applies at the motion to dismiss stage.  8  The real point here, as  as Justice  9  Kennedy said, Congress strongly supports ESOPs.  It  10  wants to encourage them so it  11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I  I appreciate that.  12  But if I'm listening to the government carefully and  13  understanding its position, it's basically saying if  14  there's been a violation of a securities law that a  15  fiduciary knows, then why shouldn't it be liable both  16  under the company, under 10b5, and the director of the  17  plan or the trustee of the plan as a breach of loyalty  18  to  or  or of prudence to the beneficiaries?  19  MR. LONG:  Well, again  again  20  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's like  yes, it's a  21  double remedy, but there's lots of things that provide  22  double remedies.  So if that person should have  23  disclosed.  24  MR. LONG:  Well, I mean, securities law will  25  provide the first remedy.  And if you're going to add an
54

1  additional  2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, it won't as a  3  trustee.  4  MR. LONG:  If you're going to add an  5  additional  6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It will against the  7  company.  8  MR. LONG:  Well, but  but the additional  9  ERISA remedy in this ESOP context is going to create  10  these tremendous problems.  I  I couldn't begin to  11  understand what the ESOP fiduciary was supposed to do in  12  these circumstances, I mean, in terms of  13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Obey the law.  I think  14  that that's the simple answer.  15  MR. LONG:  Well, but you will create two  16  different centers of communication now out of each  17  corporation with an ESOP.  The corporation's own  18  statements and then the ESOP.  19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You know they created  20  the conflicts.  21  MR. LONG:  Well, I think  I think  22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not shrugging my  23  shoulder out of lack of sympathy but out of reality.  24  The loyalty is to the beneficiaries.  If you're going to  25  place someone there who comes to inside knowledge,
55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  you're going to create potentially a problem.  2  MR. LONG:  Well, but  3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But I think your  4  adversary was saying that's a selfinduced problem, not  5  one that the law should excuse you from following  6  whatever the law is.  7  MR. LONG:  Well, but  but two points.  I  8  mean, you  I would submit you should be very cautious  9  about interpreting these duties in ways that will make  10  ESOPs unworkable, and I think that would basically cause  11  many companies to say we can't put fiduciaries in that  12  situation, so we're not going to have ESOPs at all.  13  And the  you know, again, because the  14  special purpose of an ESOP is to give the employees a  15  piece of the rock, ownership in the company, if the  16  company is going through temporary hard times, even if  17  there's a situation where there's some, you know,  18  material misinformation that is out in the market, that  19  may all be corrected in the long term.  You know, in  20  this case, if the fiduciaries had shut down the ESOP,  21  they would certainly have been sued because they would  22  have violated the plan terms, and the  the plan has  23  done very well.  It's gone up from $2 to over $22.  24  So they might have had a very hard time  25  winning that case because they would have been
56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  challenged that prudence didn't really require you to  2  shut it down.  Yes, we were going through some severe  3  problems, but we came through them.  4  That's the razor's edge.  That's the rock  5  and the hard place.  They're going to be sued unless you  6  recognize this presumption that every court of appeals  7  has recognized to give the ESOP fiduciary some leeway.  8  They're going to be different from any other fiduciary  9  in any other plan because it's the company's stock.  10  And if they, you know  if  if the stock  11  goes down under this openended duty of prudence,  12  they're going to be sued for not having anticipated that  13  and done something, sold, stopped trading, put out  14  information.  But if they don't do it and the stock goes  15  up, they're going to be sued for that.  16  And, in fact, you know, if you recognize the  17  government's approach, there'll be a whole new class of  18  cases, which is, if the stock goes up, their  19  plaintiffs' lawyers will be able to argue, well, the  20  fiduciary should have  should have anticipated that,  21  and the participants who were selling and deciding to  22  move over to the S&P 500 fund, you let them sell their  23  stock too cheaply, and that's a violation.  So it's  24  it's unworkable.  25  We submit.
