3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

4 next in Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust.

5 Mr. Frederick.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FREDERICK

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

9 and may it please the Court:

10 This case concerns the appealability of

11 remand orders under the Securities Litigation Uniform

12 Standards Act, or SLUSA.

13 Our position is that the general rule

14 prohibiting appealability applies in this case for

15 three reasons.

16 First, section 1447(d) has been consistently

17 construed to prohibit appeal of remand orders based on

18 a district court's lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

19 That rule governs even if the district court

20 incorrectly construes a subject-matter jurisdiction

21 provision.

22 Second, SLUSA section 77p(c) concededly

23 defines removal jurisdiction and it does so by

24 incorporating the criteria for preemption. Thus, the

25 court's subject-matter jurisdiction is coextensive with

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 those cases that SLUSA preempts.

2 And third, Congress knows how to make remand

3 orders appealable when it wants to, but SLUSA contains

4 no provision for appellate review of remand orders.

5 Under Respondent's approach, the Federal courts would

6 obtain jurisdiction in cases not subject to SLUSA

7 preemption, but there's no indication that Congress

8 intended that result.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Under your approach, Mr.

10 Frederick, the Federal court would decide the principal

11 substantive issue in the case, the principal legal

12 issue, nonfactual perhaps, and then decide that is has

13 no jurisdiction if it finds that it doesn't come within

14 -- within (c), sends it back to the State court. Is --

15 is the State court bound by -- by that finding by the

16 Federal court?

17 MR. FREDERICK: No, it's not.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?

19 MR. FREDERICK: Because under this Court's

20 longstanding precedent, for there to be preclusion,

21 there must be a right of appellate review. So if you

22 agree that the general rule of 1447(d) applies and

23 there is no right to appeal the remand order, then the

24 basis on which that order is -- is founded, the

25 preemption of SLUSA is open for the State court to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 address on remand.

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And for this Court, I

3 assume, at least theoretically, on petition for

4 certiorari?

5 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, through the

6 State court system.

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what was the basis

8 then, or was there a basis, for Judge Easterbrook's

9 comment, it's now or never?

10 MR. FREDERICK: He was wrong. He was wrong.

11 The issue of preemption under SLUSA can be raised by

12 the defendants on remand in the State courts. It can

13 be litigated. It's important to note that the removal

14 provision says, shall be removable. It's at the

15 defendants' discretion whether they want to ask the

16 Federal court to test whether SLUSA preempts the case

17 or to keep it in State court for the State court to

18 apply SLUSA and thereby hold that the class action

19 would be unsustainable.

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we have a standard --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have any cases that --

22 that are like this one which are like this one which

23 involve not just res judicata of -- of the -- of the

24 finding by the Federal court, but the law of the case?

25 I mean this is the same case when it's remanded.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 You've already had a court that has found a particular

2 element with respect to this case. It seems to me

3 highly unusual to have the same issue in the same case

4 then decided by a second court. Do you have any -- any

5 parallel?

6 MR. FREDERICK: There are cases in the lower

7 courts, Your Honor, in the complete preemption area

8 that have held that a removal based on the doctrine of

9 complete preemption was not sustainable because the

10 case was not completely preempted, but holding that

11 preemption, implied conflict preemption, can be applied

12 by the State courts on remand.

13 And it's important to note here that there --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have any case of

15 ours, though.

16 MR. FREDERICK: Not that I'm aware of, but

17 what the City of Waco case says, upon which they base

18 their reliance, is that the reason why there was appeal

19 of that particular order was because it would be held

20 preclusive. Here, it would not be held preclusive

21 because there is no right of appellate review.

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is -- is there --

23 correct me if I'm wrong, but I -- I had thought there

24 was an -- an easier answer, and that is that the -- the

25 decision that ultimately the State court will make, as

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to whether there is or is not preclusion, is not

2 identical to the decision that the Federal court --

3 that the district court makes on the motion for remand

4 because on the -- and this is the way I was going about

5 it.

6 On the motion for remand, all a Federal court

7 decides is whether, in fact, there is a colorable basis

8 for the removal. When it goes back, if it does go

9 back, to the State court, there will be an opportunity

10 not to go merely to the stage of colorable basis, but

11 to litigate it ultimately on the merits. So -- so that

12 what we have is a -- in effect, a kind of quick-look

13 finding at the Federal level, and that does not

14 preclude a -- a complete development of the issue on

15 the merits in the State court, if that's where it goes.

16 MR. FREDERICK: That is certainly true,

17 although I would take issue with the notion of there

18 being a colorable claim. I don't think that the SLUSA

19 removal is analogous to the Federal officer removal

20 statute where the statute itself says the defense has

21 to be under color of law, and this Court in the Mesa v.

22 California case said that phrase is where the colorable

23 claim creates article III jurisdiction.

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but do you take

25 the position --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FREDERICK: But I -- I don't -- sorry.

2 If I could just finish. I don't contest the rest of

3 it, which is that on remand, preemption can be

4 developed through amended pleadings, through facts that

5 are developed --

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you must take

7 issue with the this is only a quick determination,

8 unless you also agree with -- disagree with Justice --

9 Judge Easterbrook when he said, the decision for the

10 Federal court is only two things. It's either remand

11 or dismiss the action. That is, the Federal court

12 under no circumstances will keep this case for trial.

13 Either it will dismiss it outright or it will remand.

14 MR. FREDERICK: Well, under their theory,

15 though, Justice Ginsburg, the court could, because of

16 their construction of the removal jurisdiction

17 provision, would retain jurisdiction.

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but that was not --

19 certainly not the Seventh Circuit's understanding.

20 MR. FREDERICK: Well, and we think that that

21 position that they have advanced in this Court is

22 incorrect, and I would agree with your postulate that

23 what the Federal district court does and it has

24 jurisdiction to do is to decide whether preemption

25 applies and then remand the case, or if preemption does

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 apply, to dismiss it.

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Whether preemption applies

3 or whether there's a colorable basis for saying? I

4 thought you were saying that the district court decides

5 whether preemption applies.

6 MR. FREDERICK: It does -- it does do that.

7 It's actually --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you don't -- you don't

9 agree with what Justice Souter was saying, that all

10 it's -- all it's making is a colorable basis.

11 MR. FREDERICK: I thought I expressed my

12 position there.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, you take the

14 position that -- and -- and you may well be right, but

15 I mean, you take the position that there is a complete

16 determination on the merits at the -- at the stage at

17 which the district court rules on the motion to remand.

18 MR. FREDERICK: That's -- on the basis of the

19 record then before it.

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

21 MR. FREDERICK: Yes.

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say on the basis

23 of the record then before it. I mean, they can -- they

24 can -- can they put in any evidence they want?

25 MR. FREDERICK: The court always has the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 authority to have evidence taken to determine its own

2 jurisdiction. That's routinely done by district

3 courts.

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, as I

5 understand it, at least the Seventh Circuit's fix on

6 this case was that the Federal courts have adjudicatory

7 authority to do one thing and to do that one thing

8 finally, that is, to decide whether this is a case that

9 cannot be brought in any court or whether it's a case

10 that Congress has left over for the States still to

11 deal with. That was the whole theory of the Seventh

12 Circuit, that this is no quick look. The -- the

13 Federal courts are making a final determination. And I

14 think that would exclude what Justice Souter has

15 suggested.

16 MR. FREDERICK: I -- I agree with you that

17 that is how the Seventh Circuit described the opinion

18 and what -- what the adjudicatory authority was, and

19 that is why we take issue with the Seventh Circuit. We

20 do think that the State court on remand has any issue

21 that the defendants want to raise before it. All that

22 the Federal district court has done is to decide that

23 -- that there was no basis for a SLUSA preemption

24 because the requisites of subsection (b) had been

25 satisfied.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 But I want to point out that the issue before

2 you is whether or not that decision, correct or not, is

3 appealable. And what is important in the error of the

4 Seventh Circuit was that they held that that decision

5 was appealable, and under the Thermtron rule, as

6 applied in Gravitt and Things Remembered, even a

7 district court decision that is erroneous in its

8 construction of a subject-matter jurisdiction provision

9 is still a remand based on subject-matter jurisdiction

10 and therefore falls within the four corners --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it doesn't -- what

12 Thermtron says is that we read (d) in conjunction with

13 (c). Now, the reason that (c) is relevant here is

14 because it says, if at any time before final judgment

15 it appears that the district court lacks subject-

16 matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded.

17 Presumably what (c) is thinking of are cases

18 where subject-matter jurisdiction is not the whole

19 issue before the -- the Federal court. It's thinking

20 that subject-matter jurisdiction in certain instances,

21 like a defect in a removal proceeding, is something

22 that the -- that the Federal court could get to prior

23 to a final judgment.

24 But here, the final judgment in the Federal

25 court is the very question of whether this is preempted

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 or not. And therefore, I guess what Easterbrook is

2 thinking is that that isn't the kind of subject-matter

3 jurisdiction dismissal to which (c) refers.

4 Consequently, it is not within the scope of (d)'s no

5 appellate review rule.

6 MR. FREDERICK: And our problem with that,

7 Justice Breyer, is that all eight district court

8 decisions here thought that they were deciding subject-

9 matter jurisdiction, and they thought that because

10 Federal preemption ordinarily is not a basis for

11 removal. And --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: No. It's no doubt that all

13 the lower courts then would be wrong. But the reason

14 he says that they are wrong is because they looked at

15 the word, subject-matter jurisdiction, in (c) without

16 realizing that the reference in (c) is a reference to

17 instances where subject-matter jurisdiction is not the

18 whole issue; i.e., it's something other than the final

19 Federal court decision.

20 MR. FREDERICK: It -- it is --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: That would be the argument

22 he's making. I would like your response.

23 MR. FREDERICK: Well, functionally it is the

24 equivalent of codifying the complete preemption

25 doctrine, which is how SLUSA actually works. And in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the complete preemption cases, Beneficial Bank is what

2 spells out this --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you. You would

4 also have to say that the same rule applies, one, to

5 the complete preemption cases and, two, to sovereign

6 immunity determinations under the Foreign Sovereign

7 Immunity Act. But he would say that may be so, but

8 nonetheless, Judge Easterbrook would say, well, so be

9 it. That's what Congress intended. That is wrong to

10 deprive someone of a right to appeal when it turns on a

11 misreading of (c) and an incorporation of the

12 misreading into (d).

13 MR. FREDERICK: It would be a strikingly odd

14 result, though, for this Court to reach that, given

15 that Congress has clearly provided for appellate review

16 of remand orders in other contexts, including in the

17 Class Action Fairness Act, under tribal property

18 disputes, the FDIC, the RTC, and specifically in

19 1447(d) itself, civil rights cases. So Congress knows

20 how to do this if that's what Congress had intended.

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't the -- isn't

22 the argument --

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, can I ask

24 you a question?

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that in those cases in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 which Congress has provided, we -- we are not dealing

2 with a situation in which the -- the removal or not,

3 the preemption or not is the end of the litigation.

4 Here, we've got a case in which there -- there are

5 basically two kinds of preemption, as -- as you've

6 recognized. There is -- there is regular preemption,

7 on the basis of which there may or may not be a

8 removal, and there is a preclusion of any litigation

9 whatsoever.

10 And in the cases in which Congress has made

11 specific provision, were they -- the instances -- were

12 they instances in which it was the second issue which

13 precluded any litigation whatsoever? The answer may be

14 yes. I just don't know.

15 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I think that the

16 closest analogy, again, is in the complete preemption

17 area where the Court has held that, you know, the

18 removal is based on complete preemption, and if that is

19 found by the district court, that functionally

20 terminates the litigation.

21 But I would point out that even in the

22 Federal officer removal statute, there's no appellate

23 review of a district court's decision that the Federal

24 officer statute was improperly invoked to remove an

25 action. So what the securities defendants here are

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 asking for is something Congress didn't even give to

2 Federal officers.

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you one

4 preliminary question just to be sure I understand the

5 case. Is it your view -- when the petition for removal

6 was filed, did the district -- Federal district court

7 have jurisdiction to decide the preemption issue in

8 your view?

9 MR. FREDERICK: It had the -- it had the

10 power to determine whether SLUSA applied.

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: All right.

12 MR. FREDERICK: And that's what section

13 77p(c), when it says, as set forth in subsection (b),

14 is referring to. So the district court analyzed those

15 factors and it came --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: So the -- there -- there

17 was jurisdiction in the Federal court to entertain the

18 removed case.

19 MR. FREDERICK: Yes.

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Then -- then why -- then

21 how can you say the -- the remand was based on a lack of

22 -- of jurisdiction?

23 MR. FREDERICK: Because the courts held that

24 the requisites of SLUSA of subsection (b) had not been

25 satisfied.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but they -- they had

2 held it acting on an interpretation of SLUSA before our

3 decision in Dabit.

4 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct.

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: And isn't it at least

6 possible that they would -- would have decided that

7 issue had they reviewed --

8 MR. FREDERICK: It is possible, but that's

9 why the issue of the underlying district court's

10 determination is not before you. The issue before you

11 is can appellate jurisdiction be asserted to review

12 that decision.

13 But I would further point out, Justice

14 Stevens, that the Dabit court assiduously avoided the

15 kinds of claims that are present in our case, which is

16 whether or not negligence can be asserted against the

17 securities defendants for failure to fair-value price.

18 Dabit was strictly a fraud case, as this Court made

19 clear. This is a negligence case, and there is a part

20 of subsection (b) which makes very clear that what

21 SLUSA is getting at are claims based on fraud.

22 But even if you were to disagree that the --

23 the district court had, you know, an alternate basis

24 that had not been properly ventilated or addressed by

25 the district court because it went off on the holder

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 theory that this Court rejected in Dabit, you still

2 wouldn't have jurisdiction to decide that because of

3 the general rule of 1447(d), which provides, as I have

4 stated, that a court doesn't have jurisdiction to

5 review -- appellate review of a remand order.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, will --

8 would you please explain something to me that you just

9 said? You said that our complaint isn't about fraud.

10 It isn't about deception. It's about negligence. But

11 the Seventh Circuit reported and seemed to have no

12 doubt about it that the complaints in this set of cases

13 were based on allegations of deceit and manipulation,

14 not mismanagement.

15 MR. FREDERICK: That's incorrect, Justice

16 Ginsburg. We've put the complaints before you. They

17 are in the joint appendix. We have cited every

18 paragraph in which those claims are asserted.

19 The Seventh Circuit based its decision about

20 that on a misunderstanding of the colloquy at oral

21 argument in the Seventh Circuit, which Respondent's have

22 recited the Web site. You can listen to the argument

23 yourself. It did not contain any type of concession by

24 counsel for the class that these claims were anything

25 other than the negligence claims, which on the four

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 corners of the complaint, they assert themselves to be.

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the Seventh Circuit

3 said precisely, in particular, they did not argue in

4 their briefs and did not maintain at oral argument,

5 despite the court's invitation that their suits allege

6 mismanagement rather than deceit or manipulation. So

7 is that totally wrong, that you did do it -- mention it

8 in your briefs?

9 MR. FREDERICK: The briefs recounted what the

10 claims are, which are negligence claims.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how could the Seventh

12 Circuit have gotten it that wrong?

13 MR. FREDERICK: Well, the Seventh Circuit

14 made five crucial errors, that it was wrong to describe

15 the district court as saying that removal was proper.

16 The district court didn't say that.

17 They were wrong to say that the remand was

18 based on section 77(d)(4). That's not what the

19 district court did.

20 They were wrong to evaluate section 77p(c)

21 without even reciting or construing the language.

22 They were wrong to say that SLUSA's

23 substantive decisions, quote, must be made by the

24 Federal rather than the State judiciary. That's not

25 correct.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And they were wrong to say that it was now or

2 never for appellate review whether an action under

3 State law is preempted.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it -- it might

5 have been that prior to Dabit, you would have been

6 emphasizing -- or whoever would have been emphasizing

7 the -- the fraud character of -- of the claims, and

8 after Dabit, perhaps the negligence boat is the only

9 one left for you.

10 MR. FREDERICK: But the point, Mr. Chief

11 Justice, is that this is on a basis of subject-matter

12 jurisdiction. It's not waivable and we're permitted to

13 say that a district court decision based on subject-

14 matter jurisdiction can look at the relevant claims.

15 It is true that the perception at the time was that

16 these holder theories evaded SLUSA. All of the courts

17 up until that time of Kircher II had held that, and

18 that's not an unreasonable position for a lawyer to

19 take.

20 Now, certainly after Dabit, those claims are

21 foreclosed where there are holder fraud claims. We do

22 -- we obviously don't take issue with that.

23 But here, the claims in the complaint

24 themselves are based on negligence, and it is certainly

25 fair --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe this is not a

2 fair -- how likely is it, given our determination in

3 Dabit about how Congress intended to treat fraud

4 claims, that negligence claims are going to fare any

5 better?

6 MR. FREDERICK: Well, this Court in the Santa

7 Fe case, Mr. Chief Justice, said that negligence claims

8 are not within 10b-5. Those are claims that are

9 properly brought under State law.

10 JUSTICE BREYER: Would it make sense --

11 MR. FREDERICK: So if the -- if the State

12 court applies Dabit and Santa Fe, it will come to the

13 conclusion that the holder theory is preempted under

14 Dabit, but the negligence theory is not preempted under

15 the Santa Fe case.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: Does it make -- what's

17 worrying me in the back of my mind is we have decided

18 Dabit since this case was brought. Then I thought,

19 well, could we remand this case in light of Dabit.

20 Now, if we did that, we wouldn't decide the issue that

21 you all want decided, and we'd let this, unfortunately,

22 slightly confused situation continue to exist.

23 What would be the consequence of that? Are

24 there -- are there a lot of cases, or is this something

25 that comes up often?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FREDERICK: It does come up often because

2 the securities bar, every time they get a district

3 court decision that they don't like, they want to

4 appeal it, notwithstanding the general bar of

5 appealability. So this issue is something that is very

6 important to both sides in the development of this law.

7 But I would further point out, Justice

8 Breyer, that as this case has come up, your -- your

9 view would have to be based on do you have appellate

10 jurisdiction, and our submission is that you don't,

11 subject for purposes of remanding the case in light of

12 Dabit.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to think. It

14 seems if you -- it ought to work out similarly to what

15 happens in a case where there's a Federal issue that

16 you remove under. Now you've removed. And there also

17 is a State issue pendent. Now, what the judge does is

18 he says, defendant, you win on the Federal issue, and

19 I'm going to send this thing back now, remand it,

20 because I don't think I want to maintain here the State

21 issue. And so it's a remand order. The case is

22 remanded.

23 Now, I think you get an appeal on your

24 Federal issue there. And then -- then why shouldn't --

25 if that's so, shouldn't this work out the same way?

1 MR. FREDERICK: Well, in the Cohill case,

2 this Court addressed the situation where there was a

3 Federal dismissal of the claims and the -- and the

4 Federal district court remanded the State claims for

5 consideration under -- under State jurisdiction. And

6 the Court had internal discussion about whether or not,

7 you know, there was appealability of what was left in

8 the case.

9 Our -- our position is that ordinarily a

10 dismissal of a Federal claim is an appealable matter

11 and that that is subject to appeal, but that a remand

12 decision, which is what the district court made in this

13 case, is not.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Shouldn't it work out the same?

15 MR. FREDERICK: No, it shouldn't and the

16 reason it shouldn't is because Congress has decided

17 that it shouldn't. Congress has decided that there is

18 a paramount interest in having decisions made on their

19 merits, which is why there is not appellate review of

20 remand orders. That's --

21 JUSTICE ALITO: But aren't you -- aren't you

22 urging a very strange result that the -- the decision

23 on the merits of the SLUSA preclusion issue should be

24 decided by the State courts when the whole purpose of

25 -- of that provision was to take matters out of the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 State courts because there was a view in Congress that

2 they were not being handled properly there?

3 MR. FREDERICK: No, Justice Alito, to the

4 contrary. They are being decided by Federal district

5 courts. They're just no subject to appellate review,

6 and it was because --

7 JUSTICE ALITO: I thought you said the merits

8 of the issue was not going to be decided by the Federal

9 court.

10 MR. FREDERICK: No. Well, the -- the merits

11 of the case are going to be decided by the State court.

12 The question of whether there's a Federal defense

13 based on SLUSA in the first instance is decided by the

14 district court in remanding the case, and then if there

15 becomes a basis through evidence or amendment to the

16 pleadings or whatnot, if the defendants want to re-

17 raise their SLUSA preemption argument, they are

18 certainly free to do that.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: So he's right that it's

20 ultimately not decided by the Federal court.

21 MR. FREDERICK: No, it is decided.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying the Federal

23 court makes a decision which is not binding in the

24 case. That decision can be undone by the State court.

25 MR. FREDERICK: It is decided by the Federal

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 court within the confines of what Congress has

2 determined based on its wording of SLUSA and its fact

3 that, as this Court has said in Things Remembered, the

4 Congress is presumed to accept the general rule of

5 nonappealability unless it says so.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I understand that.

7 Can you answer my question? You -- you were

8 saying that the -- that the decision by the Federal

9 court on this issue is not final.

10 MR. FREDERICK: I'm saying that it is final

11 for purposes of remand.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but it is not final --

13 MR. FREDERICK: And that in terms --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for purposes of the

15 lawsuit.

16 MR. FREDERICK: Because -- because what SLUSA

17 does is it has an interplay between the removal

18 jurisdiction provision and it says, as set forth in

19 subsection (b).

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but as

21 long as you say that, the point that -- that Justice

22 Alito makes is -- is well taken, that we -- we thought

23 that this was a -- a statute designed to have the

24 Federal courts determine this issue, and it turns out

25 that the Federal court just takes the first swing at

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it, and if a State court disagrees, it's -- it's free

2 to do so.

3 MR. FREDERICK: That is a policy choice that

4 Congress made when not providing a special mechanism

5 for appellate review of remand orders.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Of course, if the Federal

7 district court says there is preclusion, therefore,

8 case dismissed, that would be reviewable.

9 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, and that's

10 where the uniformity of decisions would come from, the

11 reviews by plaintiffs who's had their -- who have had

12 their cases dismissed. Those are subject to appeal.

13 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

15 Frederick.

16 Mr. Perry.

17 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY

18 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

19 MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

20 may it please the Court:

21 It was quite a litany of errors that Judge

22 Easterbrook is alleged to have committed in this case.

23 I would submit, Your Honors, he committed none.

24 Judge Easterbrook correctly recognized that

25 the only issue put into play by these Petitioners was

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the Dabit question. In their motion to remand this

2 docket, docket number 20 in the Kircher case, they

3 said, it is the fourth requirement, the in-connection-

4 with requirement, which is at issue in the present

5 case.

6 We pointed out in every subsequent brief that

7 they had waived all other issues, and they never

8 responded to that waiver. It is that, Justice

9 Ginsburg, to which Judge Easterbrook was responding

10 when he said plaintiffs never argued in their briefs

11 and they did not maintain an argument that any other

12 requirement --

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Could we just -- can I ask

14 you suppose they didn't waive it? Would their -- would

15 their position have any merit?

16 MR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. Their complaint

17 rests on two factors that are clearly within SLUSA.

18 First, misrepresentations. They claim that our

19 prospectuses misled them into investing in these mutual

20 funds and then --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me put the question

22 just a little differently. Suppose the -- in Dabit, we

23 decided that the distinction between the purchaser-

24 seller rule and the scope of 10b-5 did not prevent

25 SLUSA from preempting. But does SLUSA preempt a claim

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that is beyond the scope of rule 10b-5?

2 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, SLUSA precludes

3 precisely what subsection (b) says it precludes, which

4 is beyond the scope of 10b-5. For example, 10b-5

5 requires scienter. SLUSA has no scienter requirement.

6 So a non-scienter-based State law claim is still

7 precluded under SLUSA.

8 What SLUSA requires is a misrepresentation,

9 omission, manipulation, or deceptive device in

10 connection with the purchase or sale of securities.

11 Period. All of that is present in this complaint.

12 They allege omissions.

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they can always amend

14 the complaint and pare it down and say now -- we -- we

15 complained all along about negligence. Now, Judge, we

16 are complaining about mismanagement on the defendants'

17 part, nothing more. No manipulation. Cut out -- they

18 could have such a complaint, and would that be

19 precluded if -- if they started afresh in the State

20 court and they said, we are complaining about

21 mismanagement? We're not charging anyone with fraud or

22 deception. Couldn't -- isn't that a viable claim?

23 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, in this case they

24 could not amend their complaint because the Federal

25 jurisdiction is determined on the complaint that we

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 removed. And at the time of removal, it was clearly

2 precluded by SLUSA. And the Court's cases are very

3 clear that a plaintiff may not amend. For example, you

4 can't lower the amount in controversy below $75,000 to

5 get back to State court. At the time of removal, the

6 Federal court both had jurisdiction over this case and

7 it was clearly precluded under SLUSA.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and I

9 understand your submission -- and perhaps it's distinct

10 from the Seventh Circuit holding in this respect -- to

11 suggest that those are different standards, the

12 standard for removal and the standard for preclusion.

13 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, I think we're the

14 same as the Seventh Circuit. We may have articulated

15 it slightly different, but yes, they are different

16 standards.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that under your

18 view at least, it's possible that you could have

19 removal jurisdiction and then determine that the -- the

20 case is not, in fact, preempted.

21 MR. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so that an

23 entirely State law case would proceed in Federal court.

24 MR. PERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, let me give

25 you an example. The answer is yes.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 In a case in which there is removal

2 jurisdiction because the defense is colorable, there

3 may be a factual issue as to whether the in-connection-

4 with requirement is met. In 10b-5 cases, it's not

5 uncommon that that is a factual question, not a legal

6 question. The Federal court would then retain

7 jurisdiction to decide that question on summary

8 judgment, at trial, or whatever. It won't know until

9 it finally disposes of the --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there another

11 instance in which we've upheld Federal court

12 jurisdiction over a purely State law cause of action,

13 apart from the Federal officer situation?

14 MR. PERRY: You have the Federal officer

15 situation and you have the FSIA, Foreign Sovereign

16 Immunities Act situation, Your Honor.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But those are the

18 only two.

19 MR. PERRY: Correct.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this would be a

21 pretty unusual creature that you're asking us to

22 sanction.

23 MR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. It would be

24 precisely the same creature that happens every time

25 Congress makes a case removable on the basis of a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Federal defense. Every time Congress does that, which

2 is not very often, the Court has held that the

3 colorable defense is sufficient to invest the Federal

4 court with jurisdiction.

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then, Mr. Perry,

6 there's a whole case. See, what's peculiar about this

7 is Congress says it's not really preemption. I think

8 Justice Stevens pointed that out in Dabit. It is

9 preclusion. It says this action shall not exist.

10 Period. Not as a State claim, not as a Federal claim.

11 And it wanted the Federal courts to monitor that

12 determination. It surely didn't want -- if -- if the

13 State claim is outside that preclusion, didn't want the

14 Federal courts to sit and have a whole trial on what is

15 a non-diverse, no Federal question case. I mean, it

16 just seems -- if you're going to imagine what Congress

17 wouldn't want in the Federal court, that would be it.

18 MR. PERRY: Justice Ginsburg, three answers.

19 First, Congress wanted Federal courts to make

20 the decision, not monitor the decision.

21 Second, we agree the Federal court has the

22 power to remand the case. If all that's left is State

23 law claims, the court doesn't have to keep it.

24 And third, that is what -- the regime that

25 Congress set up was designed because there is a risk of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 error. Some district courts will get some SLUSA

2 preclusion questions wrong. And the question before

3 this Court really is would Congress have wanted those

4 cases to stay in the Federal courts subject to Federal

5 appellate review or --

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But now there you must

7 admit that you are departing from Judge Easterbrook

8 because Judge Easterbrook said this statute gives the

9 Federal court adjudicatory authority to do one thing,

10 to decide whether there's preemption or preclusion or,

11 if not, then to remand. So they make -- they make one

12 determination and bow out he said. And you're telling

13 us, no, they don't bow out. They can, if they want to,

14 keep the State law claim and adjudicate it on the

15 merits.

16 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, Judge Easterbrook

17 read section -- subsection (d)(4) to require remand.

18 Petitioners and Respondent's are in agreement in this

19 Court for the first time that (d)(4) does not apply to

20 the remand in this case. It only applies to remands

21 for expressly exempted actions. The -- (d)(4), it

22 says, shall be remanded.

23 The corollary to that, we would submit, is

24 that where Congress recognizes that certain cases shall

25 be remanded, even though they're within the removal

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 jurisdiction, other cases, such as this one, may be

2 remanded. Otherwise, Congress could have said all

3 cases that are not precluded shall be remanded.

4 And -- and, Justice Ginsburg, it's not as

5 counterintuitive as -- as I think Petitioners are

6 trying to make it seem because there may be Federal

7 issues that continue past the preclusion --

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. I'm simply asking

9 about the Seventh Circuit's understanding of the case.

10 It says, after making the decision that 77p(b)

11 requires, the district court has nothing else to do.

12 Dismissal and remand are the only options. So Judge

13 Easterbrook or the Seventh Circuit clearly did not

14 think that there was any adjudication on the merits of

15 a State law claim to be made. He said it twice. One

16 is at 14a of the joint appendix, and the other is 11a.

17 MR. PERRY: And, Justice Ginsburg, the reason

18 he said that was because of -- of section -- subsection

19 (d)(4), which is quoted in full at the top of page 12a

20 of the petition appendix. That is because the Second

21 Circuit had held that (d)(4) applies to remands in this

22 situation, and both Petitioners and Respondent's in

23 their Seventh Circuit briefing took that position.

24 When we got to this Court and we both looked harder at

25 the statutory scheme, we both realized that we were

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 wrong. Therefore, Judge Easterbrook -- you know, the

2 one mistake he made was the one we led him into making.

3 But that doesn't change the validity of his

4 jurisdictional analysis, which is to say that the only

5 requirement of SLUSA that goes to the jurisdiction on

6 removal is whether this is a covered class action. The

7 elements of the preclusion defense are then the

8 substantive question of Federal law that Congress

9 authorized the Federal court to make, and it authorized

10 the Federal court to make final.

11 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm confused now. You're

12 saying both sides agreed that section 1447(d) does not

13 apply?

14 MR. PERRY: No, Justice Breyer. Both sides

15 agree that SLUSA, section 77p(d)(4) --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, then --

17 then I understand that.

18 What I don't understand is the question about

19 something remaining to be done. What -- what 77p(b)

20 says is the covered class action, I take it, is any

21 private party alleging. And when I see the word

22 alleging, I think you're supposed to look at the

23 complaint to see what they allege, not some other thing

24 about what's going to happen later. But you're telling

25 me that's wrong.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. PERRY: Your Honor --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: And if you're right that

3 that's wrong, I don't see how you could possibly get

4 out of (c) in 1447(c) which talks about a decision

5 before final judgment, that it lacks subject-matter

6 jurisdiction. Because if you're right, then this is

7 before final judgment, it lacks subject-matter

8 jurisdiction. That's the end of your case.

9 MR. PERRY: Justice Breyer, I disagree

10 respectfully.

11 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. You have to

12 disagree with -- I guess -- go ahead. Disagree. I'd

13 like to hear the answer.

14 (Laughter.)

15 MR. PERRY: If it is a covered class action,

16 that is, 50 plaintiffs and so forth --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

18 MR. PERRY: -- it is removable and within the

19 subject-matter jurisdiction of the Federal courts so

20 long as the defendant has presented, either on the

21 complaint or in the removal papers, a colorable defense

22 of preclusion. Only --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, which would have to be

24 a colorable defense that there is an allegation by the

25 plaintiff that falls within (b).

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. PERRY: An allegation by the plaintiff as

2 elaborated on by the removal notice, if necessary,

3 because where Congress has waived the well-pleaded

4 complaint rule, the removal court will look beyond the

5 four corners of the complaint to include affidavits and

6 other materials provided by the defendant. That has

7 always been held the case in -- in the rare instances

8 where Congress has made a Federal defense removable.

9 The Court said that in the Franchise Tax Board case,

10 for example, and it's well supported by history from

11 the 1870's --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I don't think that any

13 of those cases are comparable, in that the removed case

14 is going to be tried someplace.

15 Take a diversity case. The Federal court has

16 to decide -- and it's removed -- whether the parties

17 are really diverse. If it decides that they are really

18 diverse, it keeps the case and it's adjudicated in

19 Federal court. If it decides they're not, the case is

20 adjudicated in the State court.

21 But here, the determination is, is there a

22 claim to be tried anyplace? And if there is preclusion

23 under SLUSA, then it's not a question of, as Judge

24 Easterbrook put a menu, where is -- it's not a where

25 question. It's a whether question. And so that makes

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- makes SLUSA quite different from other cases where

2 the -- the case is going to be tried someplace. Here,

3 the decision to be made is, is this going to be tried

4 or not? Is it -- is it a claim or is not a claim?

5 MR. PERRY: I entirely agree with you, Judge

6 -- Justice Ginsburg, and I think that supports Judge

7 Easterbrook's opinion.

8 In the where will it be tried case, the lack

9 of appellate review is less important because the

10 merits of the case will go to State court and up

11 through the system, and any Federal issues can reach

12 this case.

13 In the SLUSA case, where the district court

14 erroneously, as we know the district court erroneously

15 did here, denies the preclusion and sends the case back

16 to State court, that is a final determination of

17 Federal law that we submit is not reviewable in State

18 court and can't be reviewed by this Court up on review

19 through the State system. So that --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you say it is not --

21 why do you say that it cannot be examined in State

22 court if there's no appeal in the Federal forum?

23 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, this Court has always

24 held and reiterated in the Munsingwear case that where

25 a collateral estoppel attaches because an issue has

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 been fully and finally litigated in a court of

2 competent jurisdiction between the same parties, that

3 the availability of an appeal --

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the --

5 MR. PERRY: -- does affect collateral

6 estoppel.

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but -- but there is

8 also exceptions to the rule of claim and issue

9 preclusion, and when you don't have an opportunity to

10 appeal because the system doesn't let you appeal, then

11 you can say, Judge, don't give this preclusive effect.

12 I did not have that full and fair opportunity because

13 I was unable to appeal. And I think that that's a solid

14 preclusion law.

15 MR. PERRY: Justice Ginsburg, this Court has

16 never held that an appeal is required to give

17 collateral estoppel effect. Therefore, on remand, the

18 court could -- the Madison County State court could

19 give collateral estoppel effect. In fact, I expect

20 Petitioners would argue precisely that. And no

21 decision of this Court stands as a barrier to that.

22 The Court would have to change preclusion law to say

23 that the lack of an appeal is a prerequisite to an

24 approval. I agree with you, Your Honor, that it can

25 be taken into account by a court, but it does not --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And a Nassau County court

2 could say, we're not going to treat that as preclusive.

3 They didn't have a fair chance to appeal. And that

4 would be all right.

5 MR. PERRY: And if they came out the other

6 way and said, I am going to treat it as preclusive,

7 because the Supreme Court says you don't have to have a

8 right to appeal, we'd be stuck with that.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you wouldn't be stuck

10 with it. I mean, that would be a Federal preclusion

11 decision and that would ultimately be reviewable here.

12 MR. PERRY: That -- that decision would be

13 reviewable here, Your Honor. It's an unnecessary

14 multiple layers of appeals and going through the State

15 system to decide a Federal question that Congress

16 wanted to have decided in the Federal courts.

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in any case, you said

18 Easterbrook made only one mistake.

19 MR. PERRY: Only one mistake.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he made another one

21 when he said, it's now or never for appellate review.

22 That preclusion question could come to this Court if it

23 went -- the case went back and the Nassau County said,

24 well, I'm going to follow the Federal court, I'm not

25 going to -- at the end of the road, the preclusion

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 question would be open for this Court to review.

2 MR. PERRY: I respectfully disagree with you,

3 Justice Ginsburg. The -- if the State court gave

4 preclusive effect to the Federal court judgment, the

5 preclusion question would be open to question -- the

6 collateral estoppel question would be open to review.

7 But the substance of the remand order would not be. It

8 would still be barred by 1447(d), if Petitioners are

9 right, and this Court held exactly that in the Missouri

10 Pacific Railroad case in 1896 and has never revisited

11 that. So that we cannot get the SLUSA issue up back

12 through the State system.

13 Judge Easterbrook was exactly right. It is

14 now or never, Your Honor. And Congress certainly could

15 not have expected on an issue of this magnitude where

16 it passed a law 3 years after the PSLRA --

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now or never. The

18 question is not can you -- is there an appeal or does

19 1447(d) bar it. The question is whether an action

20 under State law is preempted.

21 And suppose this case had gone along in the

22 Federal -- in the State court, and the defense of

23 preclusion is made in the State court. The State court

24 could certainly decide that question. Nobody removed

25 it. So the State court has competence to decide that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 question, doesn't it?

2 MR. PERRY: Certainly, Your Honor.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And in -- this Court could

4 decide it on review.

5 MR. PERRY: In a non-removed case, yes.

6 Petitioners' theory, though, is if this is a 1447(d)

7 bar, and it was removed to Federal court, decided that

8 it was not precluded by SLUSA and remanded it, this

9 Court could not review it directly or indirectly, could

10 not review the issue of SLUSA preclusion decided by the

11 Federal court.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I don't understand

13 that. Why can't it?

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And your best case on that

15 is Munsingwear?

16 MR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. Our case on

17 that, where the Court held exactly that, is Missouri

18 Pacific Railroad v. Fitzgerald.

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, the Missouri Pacific

20 case.

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that a case where

22 there was no possibility of reviewing the decision of

23 the court of first instance?

24 MR. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor. It was a case

25 --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: On -- on the merits of the

2 issue as opposed to diversity?

3 MR. PERRY: On the merits of the final

4 judgment in the case, correct, Your Honor.

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And why --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, if -- I

7 mean, it's awfully surprising -- I think that's why

8 you're getting this resistance -- that there's an issue

9 in a case, does -- is the -- the State action preempted

10 or not. They've never had an appeal. So they get it

11 tried. The whole case is tried out, and then the --

12 some State court says, in our opinion it is preempted.

13 But they can't decide that. They can't decide it

14 because there was a Federal judge who said the opposite

15 in the same case before the case was final.

16 MR. PERRY: Justice Breyer, I think the State

17 court could decide that. It's not --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: And if they don't -- and if

19 they refuse to decide it, why wouldn't this Court say,

20 this is the same case? There is only one case. It

21 isn't over yet, and we're reviewing that, and we think

22 that district judge was wrong. We think that Federal

23 district judge never read Dabit, which isn't surprising

24 since it was decided after he wrote the opinion.

25 (Laughter.)

1 MR. PERRY: Justice Breyer, we would

2 certainly hope that if Petitioners were to prevail on

3 the 1447(d) issue, this Court would make clear both

4 that we could relitigate the question to State court and

5 bring it to this Court.

6 What we are saying is under the current state

7 of this Court's law, laid out in our brief and not

8 challenged in any regard by Petitioners, that is not

9 obviously the case, so that we are left with the fact

10 that a State court could give preclusive effect to an

11 obviously wrong Federal judgment that could not be

12 reviewed in this Court.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying we would

14 have to overrule Missouri Pacific?

15 MR. PERRY: I think you would have to clarify

16 at least that Missouri Pacific does not apply to SLUSA

17 removals and remands, Justice Souter.

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is part of the dynamic

19 here, Mr. Perry, that if this goes back to the State

20 court, that affects the dynamics of the litigation

21 because you now have a class action that has to

22 proceed, and that a large part of the litigation

23 strategy in these cases is determined by whether or not

24 there's going to be a full trial on the merits of the

25 class action to effect a settlement, and so forth, so

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that Congress wanted to have this reviewed quickly and

2 in the Federal courts?

3 MR. PERRY: Correct, Your Honor. And --

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?

5 Because I hadn't, frankly, realized the importance you

6 attach to the Missouri Pacific case. And the way you

7 describe it as saying that the -- the State court

8 cannot be held to have decided against a Federal right

9 -- well, anyway, the -- the point is there are two

10 things that are decided by the Federal court when it

11 remands a case. One, there was no preemption, and two,

12 therefore, there shall be a removal.

13 Now, as I understood the principle underlying

14 that case, the -- the correctness of the remand could

15 not be reviewed. That's litigated. But could not the

16 correctness of the reason given for the remand, namely

17 there was no preemption, be removed by us on

18 certiorari?

19 MR. PERRY: Not under Petitioners' theory,

20 Your Honor, because their theory is that the inquiries

21 are completely and totally coextensive. That the

22 jurisdictional inquiry, the -- the remand inquiry is

23 precisely the same as the preclusion inquiry. Our

24 position is that --

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Under their theory, but it

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 seems to me very strange to say that we could not, when

2 we do get the case on a petition for certiorari --

3 couldn't review whether it was -- whether it was in

4 fact preemption.

5 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, I'd submit that it's

6 very strange that this would not be just reviewable

7 straight up through the Federal system, as Judge

8 Easterbrook and the Seventh Circuit correctly held.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the reason is

10 there are two separate questions. They just happen to

11 be identical. But I mean, the State court isn't going

12 to worry about whether removal is appropriate or not.

13 It doesn't have to answer that question, but it may

14 well have to answer the question whether it's

15 preempted. It happens to be the same analysis, at

16 least under a reading of the statute, but that doesn't

17 meant that you -- that just because a review of the

18 removal decision -- the remand decision is -- is

19 precluded, that review of the preemption decision is

20 precluded.

21 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, that -- that may well

22 be a fair distinction of the Missouri Pacific case. We

23 come to the Court today with the law as it stands and

24 not knowing whether such a distinction will be drawn in

25 the future --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: But it's so odd.

2 MR. PERRY: -- the Seventh Circuit.

3 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose -- suppose the -- it

4 came up under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.

5 The district court judge remands the case. In his

6 opinion Romania is not a country. That's what he

7 thinks. Never heard of it.

8 (Laughter.)

9 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so it goes back to the

10 State court and the State court says, yes, that's

11 right. We've not heard of Romania either. It's not a

12 country.

13 All right. Now, you're saying there we are

14 for all time. Everybody is stuck with this holding.

15 MR. PERRY: Your Honor --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? Maybe that's

17 why I'm so surprised that such could be the law.

18 MR. PERRY: If -- if it works the same way

19 with SLUSA, such could be the law. The Court certainly

20 has the opportunity to clarify that.

21 Again, I'll return to the simpler way --

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're -- you're positing

23 a -- a State court that's going to, by golly, give that

24 Federal decision preclusive effect even though, say,

25 the Restatement of Judgments says -- now if a decision

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 didn't -- if there was no opportunity for review, then

2 that's a ground for refusing preclusive effect.

3 MR. PERRY: And in -- and in Munsingwear,

4 Your Honor, the United States cited that precise

5 provision of the Restatement of Judgments to this

6 Court, and six Justices of this Court held, no, if

7 there's no appeal, we are still going to give this

8 judgment collateral estoppel effect. Certainly a State

9 court would not be unreasonable in following this

10 Court's lead, since this Court has never retreated from

11 that statement.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Munsingwear was

13 about mootness.

14 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, it was about mootness

15 and the result of the -- the Government's complaint

16 there was that it was going to have to live with the

17 collateral estoppel effects of the judgment. One of

18 the arguments they made was, well, because we can't get

19 an appeal, we won't be bound, and the Court disagreed

20 with that en route to saying, and to avoid that

21 problem, precisely that problem, you should have asked

22 for vacatur. But since the Solicitor General didn't do

23 it, the Court -- the decision stood and it had

24 collateral estoppel effect. That -- that is the

25 holding of Munsingwear, Your Honor.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: But in -- in any case,

2 Munsingwear turned on -- not on the availability of --

3 of an appeal generally, but on the mootness of the

4 case. In other words, Munsingwear said, look, your

5 case disappeared, and the -- the only way to get rid of

6 the order you don't like is -- is vacatur. And if you

7 didn't take that opportunity to get rid of it, then the

8 -- the decision that was made survives, and that gets

9 preclusive effect. It -- it doesn't -- Munsingwear

10 would not apply of its own force in this case.

11 MR. PERRY: Well, Munsingwear reaffirmed

12 Johnson v. Wharton which said that where Congress takes

13 away the right to appeal, there is still collateral

14 estoppel effect of the district court judgment. That

15 -- that was the previous decision that Munsingwear

16 affirmed.

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not if the litigant

18 asks to have it vacated under Munsingwear, the litigant

19 would be entitled to have it vacated. So it was a foot

20 fault and the -- the Court held the counsel to the

21 mistake that had been made.

22 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, the -- the holding of

23 Munsingwear is that Johnson v. Wharton is good law, and

24 a court need not give -- may give preclusive effect to

25 a case without an appeal.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --

2 MR. PERRY: If the Court would like to change

3 that law, it's -- it's up to this Court, but that's how

4 we come to this case.

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if you -- on

6 the removal question, if there's a dispute about

7 whether it's a covered class action, dispute about the

8 number of people involved, the dollar amount, I take it

9 that is litigated at the jurisdictional stage?

10 MR. PERRY: Correct, Your Honor. I think --

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. But you say

12 that when it gets to whether it's a -- there's a --

13 involving a covered security, for some reason that

14 can't be litigated at the jurisdictional stage.

15 MR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. That is the

16 merits determination. And -- and the statute tracks --

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. No or

18 yes? That that is not litigated at the jurisdictional

19 stage?

20 MR. PERRY: That the preclusive elements are

21 the merits question of the case, not the jurisdictional

22 question.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? There

24 -- it's the same clause. What you can remove is a

25 covered class action involving a covered security. So

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 why do we have such different approaches to the

2 different prongs?

3 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, I'm agreeing with you

4 on covered security. I'm -- I'm saying that there then

5 is the further inquiry of whether all of the preclusive

6 elements of subsection 77p(b) are met, which is the

7 merits inquiry.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And --

9 MR. PERRY: There -- there are very few cases

10 that don't involve covered securities because virtually

11 every security is covered. There are very few cases

12 that aren't covered class actions because if they

13 involve more than 50 people, that's about all the

14 requirement there is. Those are the jurisdictional

15 prerequisites. That, if established, gives the court

16 subject-matter jurisdiction.

17 Then we have the substantive elements of the

18 SLUSA preclusion defense provided in a different

19 statute that is not jurisdictional, just like this

20 Court described in Arbaugh. The covered security and

21 covered class action Congress made jurisdictional by

22 putting them in the statute. The substantive elements

23 of the defense Congress did not make jurisdictional

24 because they're in another statute.

25 That's the disconnect that Judge Easterbrook

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 understood so that on the face of the opinion of the

2 district court, where it recites the defendants

3 maintain that the in-connection-with requirement was

4 met, that defense, if colorable -- and it clearly was.

5 This Court has accepted it in Dabit -- conferred

6 jurisdiction on the court, and then the substantive

7 decision on the merits was the merits determination.

8 That is the decoupling that Congress did in SLUSA, that

9 Judge Easterbrook correctly recognized, and that puts

10 this case squarely within the Thermtron exception to

11 1447(d).

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer the

13 argument, the third argument, that Mr. Frederick

14 stressed that is, that Congress provided specifically

15 in the Class Action Fairness Act, a couple of other

16 acts, and 1447 itself with respect to civil rights

17 actions removable under 1443? In all those cases, it

18 provided specifically for review of remand decisions,

19 and here the silence is deafening.

20 MR. PERRY: In those cases, Your Honor, they

21 work differently than SLUSA for two reasons. One,

22 they're the whether -- not whether it will be tried,

23 but where it will be tried. And when Congress -- and

24 when it was only a where question, Congress puts in a

25 specific provision.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 The other is CAFA, for example, is expressly

2 jurisdictional. It amends the diversity statute. So

3 there's no argument that it would be within Thermtron.

4 Every CAFA question is a 1447(c) issue. Congress had

5 to make it.

6 Here, Congress knew about Thermtron.

7 Congress has known about Thermtron for 30 years. This

8 Court reaffirmed Thermtron while they were debating

9 SLUSA. And Congress knew that this question was not

10 jurisdictional. Congress decoupled them, just as this

11 Court described in Arbaugh.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't know what -- what

13 Congress' knowledge about Thermtron was a district

14 judge who said, they removed this case, but I'm much

15 too busy. This court is much too busy to mess with

16 stuff that belongs in the State court. I'm remanding

17 it. That was just too much, and the Federal court --

18 MR. PERRY: And, Justice Ginsburg, if Judge

19 Hermansdorfer had said, I'm much too busy and therefore

20 I lack subject-matter jurisdiction, it is inconceivable

21 that the Thermtron case would have been decided any

22 differently. Congress understands the difference

23 between jurisdiction and merits. This Court

24 understands the difference between jurisdiction and

25 merits. Judge Easterbrook certainly understood that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 distinction. This determination made by the district

2 court here was a merits determination not controlled by

3 1447(c), and therefore, appeal was not barred by

4 1447(d).

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but I still

6 don't -- and this gets back to the question I asked

7 before. I mean, subsection (c) of 77p -- it's

8 unfortunate we've got a lot of subsection (c)'s here

9 but -- of -- of SLUSA incorporates subsection (b).

10 MR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. It references

11 subsection (b).

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it says what

13 can be removed is the covered class action involving a

14 covered security, as set forth in subsection (b).

15 MR. PERRY: Just as title VII says what can

16 be brought is an action under this title or just as the

17 environmental statute in Steel Company said what can be

18 brought is an action under subsection (a).

19 The cross reference of another provision

20 containing substantive elements of Federal law does not

21 make those elements jurisdictional. That's the holding

22 of Arbaugh. That's the holding of Steel Company.

23 There's no reason that the same principle shouldn't be

24 applied when Congress makes a Federal defense removable

25 as when it makes a Federal claim subject to suit within

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the original jurisdiction of the Federal courts.

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but here, what is set

3 out in subsection (b) is exactly the reason for

4 Congress' wanting to place these restrictions on it,

5 and that, it seems to me, is the sensible reason for

6 reading it the way your -- your brother on the other

7 side does.

8 MR. PERRY: Well, Justice Souter, we know

9 from Mesa that if Congress had just made all covered

10 class actions removable, we would have to find some

11 Federal defense to support article III jurisdiction.

12 Congress, by cross-referencing subsection (b), just

13 pointed the Federal courts to the particular Federal

14 defense that is sufficient, clearly sufficient, to make

15 article III satisfied under the Mesa case. That's all

16 that that cross reference is doing.

17 It's not, however, picking up every element.

18 If Congress wanted to include every element of title

19 VII, that environmental statute of SLUSA, it would have

20 put them in the jurisdictional provision. Arbaugh says

21 --

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why would it have

23 done that? That would have been a waste of time. I

24 mean, you just say, as set forth in subsection (b).

25 You're saying if they had repeated subsection (b)

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there, we'd have -- the case would come out the other

2 way?

3 MR. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor. We have not

4 only the -- the reference there, but we have the final

5 sentence of that clause where we say after removal,

6 after the court establishes that it has removal

7 jurisdiction, it shall subject the action to subsection

8 (b). That clause is entirely redundant under

9 Petitioners' reading of the statute. Entirely

10 redundant. I've read the reply brief a number of

11 times. I don't understand their explanation for that.

12 The only explanation is that Congress made

13 removability contingent on the subsection (c) factors.

14 Thank you, Your Honor.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Perry.

16 Mr. Frederick, you have 4 minutes remaining.

17 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FREDERICK

18 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

19 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you. I think it's

20 really important for you to look at the complaints in

21 these cases because every single one of them asserts

22 claims on the basis of negligence and the value -- the

23 fair-value pricing of the securities. They are not

24 based on misrepresentations. The other side has

25 attempted to make them look like misrepresentations,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and they've quoted things out of context in order to do

2 so. But the complaints themselves are pure negligence

3 claims that would fall outside of SLUSA.

4 But even if you were to disagree with that

5 and even if you were to disagree with the district

6 court's basis for saying that remand was proper because

7 it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, the general rule

8 of Thermtron, Things Remembered, and importantly, the

9 Gravitt case applies. And this Court does not have

10 appellate jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit does not

11 have appellate jurisdiction because of the plain

12 language of section 1447(d).

13 Respondents concede that State courts can

14 decide SLUSA questions. It is up to defendants to

15 decide whether to try to remove them. And subsection

16 (d), about which Mr. Perry spoke, expressly provides

17 that certain kinds of securities actions shall be

18 remanded because Congress was not so concerned that

19 Federal courts decide everything concerning securities

20 cases, but only as to those that are expressly set

21 forth in subsection (b).

22 And, Mr. Chief Justice, respectfully, what

23 subsection (c) is doing with its references to

24 subsection (b) are to incorporate those criteria as one

25 of the three elements or criteria for removability. It

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 has to be a covered security, has to be a covered class

2 action, and it has to meet the requisites of subsection

3 (b). That's the only reasonable way to read that. And

4 the last clause is simply confirmatory that if those

5 are -- are met, then the district court has to find

6 that the case shall be precluded.

7 In the Gravitt case, in which this Court

8 through a per curiam dismissed the appeal, there was a

9 dispute between the district court and the court of

10 appeals over whether the district court had properly

11 applied subject-matter jurisdiction principles in

12 deciding whether or not there was diversity. This

13 Court said, no matter. That is outside the -- the

14 requisite -- that is outside 1447(d), and the general

15 rule against appealability applies.

16 Now, importantly, they argue that they would

17 be precluded by -- from arguing against SLUSA

18 preemption in State court, but in fact, the last brief

19 -- the last page of our brief, our reply brief, cites

20 the Standefer case in which this Court held, under

21 contemporary principles -- and I'm quoting now -- under

22 contemporary principles of collateral estoppel, the

23 inability to pursue an appeal is a factor strongly

24 militating against giving a judgment preclusive effect.

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that there

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

56
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 would be Federal court review in this Court from a

2 State court determination on the applicability of SLUSA

3 in this case?

4 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, there would be. And

5 there would be -- their argument about the Missouri

6 Pacific case is wrong because what the -- what was

7 going on there was the remand determination, not the

8 underlying Federal right. And that's what would be

9 appealed, and there would also be appeal of the

10 preclusive consequences because that would be a

11 question of Federal law under this Court's longstanding

12 determination. The Restatement --

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you one question,

14 Mr. Frederick? Because it's important to me.

15 Would you agree that a complaint that alleged

16 that the defendant negligently used or employed

17 manipulative devices and so forth would be covered by

18 SLUSA -- would preempt it?

19 MR. FREDERICK: That would be covered. And

20 -- and the reason is that it is -- involved a

21 manipulation. The wording of SLUSA involves a

22 manipulation of -- of the security.

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: So the mere fact that it's

24 negligently caused would not preclude preclusion.

25 MR. FREDERICK: What -- what we're talking

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

57
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 about here, Justice Stevens -- it's important -- is

2 that in how these securities get priced, was there

3 negligence in the pricing of those, that had

4 deleterious effects on one class of holders but not on

5 market-timers that we were moving in and out of the

6 market.

7 And so, frankly, Judge Easterbrook was wrong

8 for a sixth reason, and that was in saying that there

9 would have been a derivative claim here too because a

10 derivative case has to be brought on behalf of the

11 corporation on behalf of all shareholders --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: Then the district court was

13 wrong too I guess because the district court made the

14 same --

15 MR. FREDERICK: The district court was wrong

16 in not anticipating what this Court held in Dabit, but

17 it was not wrong insofar as it held that there was no

18 subject-matter jurisdiction because this case is based

19 on negligence and not fraud.

20 Thank you.

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

22 Frederick.

23 The case is submitted.

24 (Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the

25 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
