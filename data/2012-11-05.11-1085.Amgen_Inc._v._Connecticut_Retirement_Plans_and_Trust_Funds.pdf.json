The heart of a 10b-5 claim is I bought or sold in reliance on a misleading statement. The question at the class cert stage is whether each individual will have to prove his own reliance directly on the statement, or whether every -- he can prove indirectly reliance on the statement by showing that everybody relied on a distorted market price. A market price will reflect a statement if and only if the statement is material and is made publicly on an efficient market. So, absent materiality, the market price cannot be presumed to reflect the statement in question. And the plaintiffs --"

It doesn't depend on who the relier was. But the inability to prove to a certifying judge that class-wide reliance can be -- that class-wide reliance exists because the statement was material doesn't preclude a plaintiff like Connecticut Retirement, which has said it's going to proceed whether there's a class or not, or any other member of the class, from coming to court and saying, either, I directly relied on this statement, and here's my proof that it's material to the trier-of-fact, because the decision that the judge makes at certification is not binding on the trier-of-fact; or even to say, I relied on the integrity of the market price, and I have proof think that's conceptually wrong, Justice Kagan, in the sense that all that the class certification decision says is that the putative class representative can sue on his own behalf, but he can't drag everybody else into the --"

But let me take one more run at -- at your premise. The next thing that would happen if I'm right, presumably, and the case isn't over, the class just isn't certified, is the defendant -- you know, emboldened by the judge's rule, will file a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that materiality -- the element of the substantive offense, not materiality, the predicate to class certification -- has just been determined in favor of me. That is a very different question for the Court. Materiality, as this Court has said, is fact-sensitive, and it involves a balancing of credibility of witnesses or of expert opinions, and the judge at the -- at the class cert stage, has to find facts and has to make a ruling. When it comes up on summary judgment, what the -- if there is a dispute of material facts, what the judge should do under the law is to say, look, I just held that I didn't think it was material, but I resolved disputed material facts, and that's for the jury, and this case will go to the jury."

Certainly, it should -- it ends it for the class; you said that. Should it also end it for the representative of the class to say, okay, now I'm going to come back, and this statement, -this finding of the immateriality doesn't bind me. Of course, it's going to bind the class representative. So if it's immaterial, the case ends. And if it is material, then it is material to everybody in the class."

Materiality -- the quirk of this case is that materiality is both -- as all my friends on the other side agree, an essential predicate of the fraud-on-the-market theory, that is the essential predicate of the ability to prove indirect reliance on the statement through an assertion that the market price -- that the statement distorted the market price. Everyone agrees that, if the statement isn't material, it didn't distort the market price, and therefore, reliance is an individualized issue for those who actually heard and detrimentally relied on the statement. One of the elements that has to be proven in a 10b-5 case is reliance, which is what we were talking about on the class cert stage, and there, materiality is a predicate for reliance. But even if reliance is proven, materiality is also an element of a 10b-5(b) cause of action, and the standard for materiality is the same. The real question in this case is what is the purpose of Rule 23? If you think that the purpose of Rule 23 is to postpone to the merits everything that can be postponed without a risk of foreclosing valid individual claims, we lose. But that's not the purpose. The purpose is for a court to determine whether all of the preconditions for forcing everyone into a class action are present before you certify."

So let's try out falsity at the certification stage, too. In fact, let's try out everything because we could always think of a few examples where, despite the fact that -- you know, that it's only a common issue 99 percent of the time, we can dream up a situation where it's not a common issue."

And here, for materiality, the class wins or loses together. If it's material, it's material as to everybody. If it's not material, it's not material as to everybody. And that's just a function of the fact that materiality, as we've repeatedly said, is an objective test. It doesn't have anything to do with whether a particular person finds it material. And where that's the case, it seems to me that the Wal-Mart test, which is -- is an issue central to the -- you know, when you rule on the issue, do you rule on each of the claims in one stroke?

Everyone agrees that materiality, like falsity, like scienter, like loss causation, are all common questions. As this Court explained in Basic and reiterated last term in Halliburton, in 10b-5 actions, the question at class certification is whether reliance needs to be proven directly; that is, individually by people who heard and acted in response; or whether the shortcut that this Court authorized in Basic of allowing indirect proof by proving that the statement caused a distortion of the market, is the way to go. There are two tracks, and it happens in this case that materiality is both an element, which is common, and a predicate to class-wide reliance. Everyone agrees that there -- you can't rely as a class on the -- the challenged misstatement, unless the statement moved or had the capability of moving the market price.

    "speaker": "FREDERICK",
    "speech": "There is a lot to said about Basic, and let me just start the ball rolling by making these observations. First, Basic did not try to distinguish between the requisites of Rule 23 and the substantive component of the fraud-on-the-market theory. And that's important because, in that case, the court remanded for a redetermination of materiality, but it upheld the class certification order. So in the context of Basic, the court seemed to be thinking there was a difference between what needed to be proved for class certification and what would need to be proved on the merits of the case. Now, the second thing to be said is that Basic needs to be read against the backdrop of Rule 23 and especially this Court's recent decision in Wal-Mart v. Dukes. Because materiality always generates a common answer for all class members, it is the quintessential common issue that does not splinter the class or cause it to be noncohesive for purposes of understanding predominance."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Doesn't -- doesn't that assume that the efficient market theory is always relevant to materiality? And there might be instances in which there is subjective reliance, which we inquire into, that is objectively reasonable, but that does not involve a fraud on the market?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FREDERICK",
    "speech": "Only in a hypothetical case, Justice Kennedy. And this is the absolute most important point that I can try to make today. In a fraud-on-the-market case, the idea of reliance -- the only theory of reliance that is being advanced is indirect reliance on the integrity of the market. There is no other theory of reliance. Why do we know that in this case? For two reasons: First, the Connecticut Retirement System could not be the class representative, if it did not meet the typicality requirement of Rule 23(a), which the district court found -- this is on page 25A of the petition appendix -- and has not been challenged subsequently. But why doesn't Connecticut have a direct reliance theory? We know they don't because they have a fiduciary duty to their investors to apply whatever theory they have of securities fraud. So we know in this case -- and this is, by far, clear in the run-of-the-mine fraud-on-the-market case, that the class representative will only establish reliance indirectly, by showing that the integrity of the market was impaired. And so their construct is an entirely hypothetical and theoretical one. It simply does not arise in the real world of fraud-on-the-market cases."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",

Let -- let me give you a -- a case that's -- that's not flukey and hypothetical. That is, it is usually the case that -- that people who are allegedly defrauded in stocks rely upon the fact that they bought it at an -- at an inflated price or sold it at a depressed price. Both of those questions depend upon the efficiency of the market. If the market is not efficient, a question that has to be decided for the class certification case, the individual investor is not going to be able to say, you know, that's -- that's why I got cheated, because the market reflected this false statement, and I paid more money for the stock than I should have. That -- that is not a flukey hypothetical. That is what will happen in most individual cases. And yet, that question of the efficiency of the market has to be decided at the class certification stage."

If the -- if the stock is thinly traded, there are no public analysts, there are no stock reports given about it, and no one knows exactly why is the price being determined, that creates exactly the kind of individual issues that would predominate in a securities fraud case."

MR. FREDERICK: No, the question is: Does efficiency serve as a means of determining are all the investors similarly situated? Are they a cohesive class? If the market is not efficient -- and mind you, they -- they conceded this question in their answer and they did not challenge the expert that was put in the district court on the question of efficiency, so that question's really not in this case. But in the case that you're hypothesizing, Justice Scalia, efficiency serves the gatekeeping function of determining are all the investors similarly situated, so that indirect reliance can be a -- a method of showing that predicate for a common answer to be determined at trial."

Now, it is possible, certainly, that in other cases, there might be investors out there who do have a direct reliance theory, but they are protected by Rule 23 in a couple of ways. One is they can bring their own case, and they can say, I directly relied on Amgen's misstatements and the false things that they said about their flagship products, and I, therefore, have my own 10b-5 case. Or if the class is certified and they think they have a direct reliance theory, they can opt out of the class."

We use it because if the market is efficient and the statement is public, then someone who bought over the market is buying in a -- in a world that reflects the false statement. I mean, that's -- so he -- there was sufficient reliance indirectly. All right. So I think his point is, yes, I can see materiality is something that's relevant to everybody. Of course, it is, a common issue in the case. But also, it is a feature of materiality that, if it wasn't material, then our theory of market reliance -- market -- efficient markets goes out the window because you can have all the efficiency in the world, all the publicity in the world, but still, where something to a reasonable stockbroker is irrelevant, his reaction is \"who cares?\" And therefore, although there could be special cases, the efficient market theory plays no role. Now, I think that's what his theory is, if I understand it. And -- and I don't hope it is, if I've got it -- I mean, I hope I got it right.

  {
    "speaker": "FREDERICK",
    "speech": "What I'm saying is that the efficiency question goes into the individual stock's ability to absorb information, both material and nonmaterial information. Now, the question on the merits, for which all investors will either rise or fall together, is was this company's misrepresentation a material one to the reasonable investor? And that's why all investors are going to have the same answer because it's the same objective inquiry. The question that you -- you and Justice Scalia are positing about the efficiency of the market is one on which there are disagreements among the lower courts as to how to challenge and how to deal with that question, but they do not do it on the basis of materiality. Judge Easterbrook had a very sound opinion in the Schleicher case, in which he goes through and he explains that, when there is a fraud-on-the-market case, the notion of indirect reliance, where efficiency is established, really evolves -- devolves down to the core merits question of materiality. And that is a common question that -- in which all of the investors are going to rise together. But I do want to end by saying that, when Congress looked at this question, it decided not to deal with this question of efficiency or materiality. It was faced with a specter of 300 lawsuits being filed per year that were securities fraud cases, in 1995, where a 93 percent settlement rate was occurring, an average settlement of nearly $9 million. In -- in 2011, the statistics showed that what Congress did was successful in achieving the purpose Congress attained. In the year 2011, there were 188 class actions filed; 50 percent of them were dismissed, mostly on the high-end pleading standards that Congress had enacted in the PSLRA. So it's not really for this Court's province to be imposing policy judgments about what additional requirements ought to be put on 23(b)(3); Congress made that judgment. And these proceedings that have gone along in -- in this way, were perfectly sound by -- both the district court and the court of appeals. If the Court has no further questions?"

And what Petitioners would have this Court do is isolate the two inquiries when they're really the same question. It is asking the same question that leads to the same answer, and it's one that unites the class. There's -- Petitioners phrase the question as whether reliance --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "If you have the same question, then maybe we shouldn't have this fraud-on-the-market theory because the whole purpose of it is -- is to -- to assume that -- that the whole class was -- was damaged and relied -- because you can rely on an efficient market. But you can only rely on an efficient market where there has been a material misrepresentation. So maybe we should overrule Basic because it was certainly based upon a theory that -- that simply collapses once you remove the materiality element."

    "speaker": "SHERRY",
    "speech": "The fraud-on-the-market theory, however, is a substantive theory. It's not a procedural doctrine. To be sure, one of the practical consequences is it allows classes to be certified, but it's a means of proving reliance in an impersonal market in which investors trade today. What the Court did in Basic was adapt the direct reliance concept which envisioned face-to-face transactions to the impersonal market. And so with respect to actually proving a fraud on the market, you're absolutely right, but what we're talking about here is not whether a fraud on the market can be proven; we're talking about whether common issues predominate over individual issues. And Petitioners still fail to point to any individual issue that would come into play in a case where materiality is not able to be shown. None would because materiality would kill the case for all."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, that then -- that imparts the question of 24 years of economic scholarship -- I think that's how long it's been since Basic was decided -- has shown that the -- the efficient market theory is -- is really -- really an overgeneralization. It could be much more subtle than that and so you have an advanced theory. But you want us to ignore that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SHERRY",
    "speech": "No, I -- a couple responses to that. The first one is the one that my colleague made, which is that market efficiency isn't disputed here. It was conceded in the answer at paragraph 199. And not only is it not -- is it not contested here, Petitioners actually embrace an efficient market, in order to pursue their truth-on-the-market defense. And so my first response would be that's not something to be addressed in this case. And my second response is Basic didn't adopt any particular economic model of market efficiency. If you look at footnote 24 of Basic, if you look at footnote 28 of Basic, the Court makes very clear that it's not adopting an economic theory, as far as how quickly or completely the information is incorporated into the market price. Instead, it was looking at congressional intent, it was looking at difficulties in direct proof, and it was looking at common sense to reach a result and again to adapt a reliance theory that was premised on face-to-face transactions to the impersonal market that exists today. And so, again, I wouldn't consider market efficiency in this case. It's not presented. To the extent there's questions about how the determinations should be made in terms of levels of generality, that's something that the lower courts can decide. Today, all we're talking about is the materiality component and, again, focusing on whether or not common issues predominate over individual issues. It's a comparative inquiry. It requires comparing common issues on the one hand and individual issues on the other. And Petitioners have not identified any individual issues that will actually come into play as the case is litigated. The -- going to the -- some of the policy concerns that were raised, I'd make a couple points. One is the one that my colleague made. Congress addressed those policy concerns in the PSLRA, in SLUSA, and it chose to address them through different means. The second point I would make is the same argument could be made with respect to the other elements of the securities fraud cause of action. If the argument is you should have to prove it at class certification because, otherwise, the case is going to settle, you could say the same thing with respect to scienter, with respect to falsity, with respect to loss causation, which this Court in Erica John, of course, said did not have to be proven at the class certification stage. So in short, it proves too much. The third response is that there are countervailing policy concerns, and there are countervailing concerns that are actually tethered to Rule 23 in terms of efficiency. Excuse me. Petitioners --"

  {
    "speaker": "SHERRY",
    "speech": "I would make a minor quibble on that. I would say that the market takes account of all public information, but it only -- it only moves based on material information, so that's exactly right. And so our issue is not with the predicates for the fraud-on-the-market theory. Our issue is with Petitioners equating the predicates from the fraud-on-the-market theory with the actual prerequisites of Rule 23. And this Court made it very clear, in Shady Grove, that the only question at the Rule 23 stage is whether the prerequisites have been met. The only one that we're talking about here is predominance. It's a comparative inquiry between common issues and individual issues. And if I can quickly go back to my point about countervailing policy concerns, as Petitioners acknowledge, a determination at the class certification stage is not binding on anybody -- in that case on the ultimate fact-finder, or in any other case. And so the problem with Petitioners' position is that it would require relitigation of the materiality question at the merits stage to the extent the class is certified or, if it's not, in every other case that is brought on the same issue. That doesn't serve the efficiency purposes that underlie Rule 23. The -- in terms of absent class members, he suggests that absent class members would somehow be prejudiced, but as Your Honor, Justice Kagan, pointed out, the only prejudice is that they wouldn't be able to relitigate the very same issue. That is protected by allowing opt out. That is protected by Rule 23's adequacy of representation requirement. And so that's already sufficiently protected. The most efficient course is to actually focus on common issues. Materiality is a common issue. It will result in the same answer for all. The class rises or falls together. And class certification is not about only certifying meritorious cases. In 1966, when the current version of Rule 23(b)(3) was adopted, it was an innovation. It was a change from the spurious class actions, where it was a one-way ratchet, where only the defendant was bound. In the current version of Rule 23(b)(3), you want to certify class actions that are both meritorious and those that are not, so that it reaches a binding judgment."

They agree that, unless the statement is material, however efficient the market, however loudly the statement was published, there is no detrimental reliance on the integrity of the market price. Reliance can only be approved -- and, Justice Breyer, this goes to your traditional paradigm case -- in the paradigm case, reliance was proven by the fact that you heard the statement and you did something in reliance on it, to your detriment. The innovation of Basic, and the notion that Basic didn't say anything about class certification under Rule 23 is astonishing, given the fact that the whole reason that the question of the fraud-on-the-market theory was presented, was the inquiry about whether there could be -- whether the traditional bilateral method of proving detrimental reliance on a statement could be aggregated into a ginormous class by allowing everyone to say, well, we relied on the integrity of the market price and a material misstatement -- a material statement affected that price.

    "speech": "Exactly right. And what the Court in Basic could have said, Justice Breyer, was, forget the fraud-on-the-market theory; we are going to absolve -- we are going to say that, for 10b-5 actions, you don't have to prove reliance directly on the statement. We are going to allow you to -- we -- we posit that investors rely in common on the integrity of the market price; and if you can demonstrate to us that a challenged statement moved the market -- if there was market effect, we will allow you to proceed as a class; because then the common answer to the common question, how are you going to prove reliance, is we are going to prove it all the same way because investors rely on the integrity of the market price. Now, the Court in Basic --"

What the Court in Basic could have said is, if you want to proceed as a class, you prove to the Court that reliance is common by showing that the market misstatement affected the market price. But the Court in Basic went further in the direction of class plaintiffs and said, you don't have to prove that directly. All you have to prove -- we will allow that to be presumed, if you can demonstrate, without effective rebuttal, four things: the statement was of a type that the market would care about; the statement was made publicly in an efficient market; and the trading occurred during the period between the misstatement and the correction --"

And it can't be the answer we should litigate everything before we litigate anything."

And the key to the gate is showing that the answer to the question, will reliance be proven commonly -- not lost commonly, but proven commonly -- is, in fact, yes. Thank you."
