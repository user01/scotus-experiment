3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 next in Case 14520, Hawkins v. the Community Bank of

5 Raymore.

6             Mr. Duggan.

7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. DUGGAN

8               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9             MR. DUGGAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11             Persons who jointly and severally agree to

12 repay the appliedfor debt are applicants under ECOA.

13 And that is precisely what occurred here.  My clients

14 were required, in violation of Regulation B in ECOA as

15 spousal guarantors, to become jointly and severally

16 liable to repay the debts of their husbands' business,

17 which clearly qualifies them as applicants both under

18 the straightforward language of ECOA, as well as the

19 Regulation B that was adopted by the regulators.

20             In this particular instance, as in many

21 credit transactions, the real applicants in this

22 transaction are not a tobe formed limited liability

23 company or corporation, but the persons that will stand

24 as guarantors behind that company.

25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Didn't the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Reserve Board originally, I think, in 1977 take the

4

2 opposite position and said explicitly that applicant

3 excludes guarantors?

4             MR. DUGGAN:  Your Honor  Your Honor, with

5 regard to that position that was taken by the FDIC in

6 1977, they were responding to claims by the industry

7 that they did not want applicants broadly defined to

8 include guarantors for notice provisions.  And in

9 response to that, the regulation was crafted in a way

10 that did, in fact, address that concern, but it was

11 never intended to eliminate the potential claims for

12 spousal guarantors.

13             When the case law came down and said we're

14 relying on the Regulation B of 1977, according to what

15 the regulators adopted then in 1985 they said, we were

16 mistaken.  We've been misinterpreted about what our

17 intent was.  We  we now need to modify the regulation

18 and make it clear that those persons who were

19 discriminated against based on marital status have the

20 right to bring the claim.

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have to give notice

22 to  to guarantors now?

23             MR. DUGGAN:  No, you do not, Your Honor.

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, how can that be?  I

25 mean, they're either applicants or they're not

Alderson Reporting Company

2             MR. DUGGAN:  Well, I think 

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  If they're applicants, you

4 have to give them notice.

5             MR. DUGGAN:  I think the 

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're saying they're

7 applicants for one purpose, they're not applicants for

8 another?

9             MR. DUGGAN:  Yeah, in this case 

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The agency can make that

11 up?

12             MR. DUGGAN:  Well, I think the Court has

13 already ruled in the Duke Energy case that regulators,

14 in appropriate circumstances, can even take a defined

15 term under the statute, in that case the term

16 "modification," and cause it to mean different things in

17 different subsections.

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I never liked that case.

19             MR. DUGGAN:  My apologies.

20             (Laughter.)

21             MR. DUGGAN:  What  what happened in this

22 case, Your Honor, was very, very reasonable by the

23 regulators.  They came out in 1985 

24             JUSTICE ALITO:  Just out of curiosity, why

25  well, everybody agrees that PHC Development is an

Alderson Reporting Company

1 applicant, right?

Official

6

2             MR. DUGGAN:  Agreed.

3             JUSTICE ALITO:  Why didn't PHC Development

4 sue and claim that requiring the guaranties was in

5 violation of the law?

6             MR. DUGGAN:  At that point in time, the case

7 law that had developed so far, and the Regulation B,

8 made it clear that the spouses had standing to bring the

9 claim, and the spouses were the ones that asserted the

10 claim.

11             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why does it matter, if

12 there's always somebody to bring a claim?  In what set

13 of cases does the answer to this question matter?

14             MR. DUGGAN:  I think it's important for

15 several reasons.  First of all, spouses who are required

16 to sign jointly and severally with their husbands'

17 businesses and their husbands are going to undertake

18 potential adverse credit consequences in the future.

19             Let me give you an example.  Divorce or

20 death of the primary operator of the business.  If the

21 wife has become jointly and severally liable to repay

22 the husband's debt, she then is going to be strapped

23 with his credit profile in a business that she never had

24 any operational authority, that she never was involved

25 in, and she wasn't an investor on.  She was simply

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 required to sign because she was the spouse of the

7

2 husband.  And what's important to understand in these

3 cases 

4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait, wait, wait.  You say

5 she was required to sign.  She wasn't required to sign.

6 Somebody put a gun to her head?  She wanted the husband

7 to get the loan, and this was the deal.

8             MR. DUGGAN:  And I think that's exactly what

9 the regulators 

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but don't talk about

11 it as she was required to sign.  She was not required to

12 sign.

13             MR. DUGGAN:  There was a requirement placed

14 upon 

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  If he  if he was to get

16 the loan, he had to get her to sign, but she was not

17 required to sign.

18             MR. DUGGAN:  I'd agree.  She signed the

19 guaranty by virtue of a condition being placed upon the

20 extension of credit to her husband and the lend  and

21 the borrowing entity.  And what's important to

22 understand is that in these cases, these borrowing

23 entities, and in this very case, which typifies these

24 small business organizations, that, in fact, it's never

25 really the "tobe formed limited liability company"

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that's the borrower, it's always the guarantors.

8

2             We need to look no farther than Doc 797,

3 Page 1 to 3, which is the bank's actual approval of this

4 credit application.  In that document, which was a part

5 of the trial court record, the bank, in responding to

6 its own internal writeup on the operating history and

7 the potential for the entity to pay back the debt, it

8 said "nonapplicable."  Financial projections of the

9 borrowing entity?  "Nonapplicable."

10             The precise reason to approve the loan, "I

11 recommend approval of this loan request based on the

12 financial strength of the guarantors and our collateral

13 position."  The only collateral that was ever taken in

14 that transaction was the collateral of the guarantors.

15 To suggest that guarantors are not the real applicants

16 in these loan transactions is to be divorced from

17 reality.  They are the true applicants.

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's  let's  let's

19 assume that I  I write a letter of recommendation for

20 some  some young woman who is applying to a law

21 school, or to a college.  I would really like her to be

22 admitted, and I've written a letter of recommendation to

23 sort of put my judgment, my reputation on the line on

24 her behalf.  Am I an applicant to the law school?

25             MR. DUGGAN:  No.

Alderson Reporting Company

1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would anybody use the

9

2 English language that way?

3             MR. DUGGAN:  Well, I believe, in that

4 context, that person is not agreeing to become jointly

5 and severally liable to pay the tuition.  They're not 

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What difference does it

7 make?  Instead of putting my financial solvency on the

8 line, I put my reputation on the line.

9             MR. DUGGAN:  Well, I think it's very

10 important, because the regulators made a reasonable

11 interpretation under their broad grant of authority that

12 when they're required, when a condition is placed upon

13 the approval, that they have to come forward and be

14 contractually obligated to repay the appliedfor debt,

15 they are an applicant.

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  They are not applying.

17 It's  it's their husband who's applying, and they

18 don't have to  or  or it's a company that's

19 applying.  They don't have to go in.  It's up to them.

20             MR. DUGGAN:  The guaranties in this case

21 have specific requirements for independent performance

22 by the guarantors, such as providing financial

23 statements, repaying the debt, paying their debts on

24 time, honoring all their obligations with the lender.

25 If they breach one single obligation that's independent

10 1 to their guaranty, they're obligated to repay the debt 2 in full, and  3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That doesn't show  4             JUSTICE BREYER:  What if I have a child, and 5 I apply for that child to be admitted to the XYZ public 6 school for which I will pay  a private school, for 7 which I will pay the tuition.  Am I an applicant? 8             MR. DUGGAN:  I don't think so. 9             JUSTICE BREYER:  You don't think so? 10             MR. DUGGAN:  I think in part you may be, but 11 my  my contention  12             JUSTICE BREYER:  Wait, wait, wait.  This was 13 a favorable question.  I thought it's obvious that when 14 a parent applies  15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you shouldn't  you 16 shouldn't have asked that. 17             (Laughter.) 18             JUSTICE BREYER:  I have a parent that 19 applies for  20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You and I share that 21 concern. 22             JUSTICE BREYER:  What?  Wait.  A parent 23 applies for a child, her child, to be admitted to a 24 school which she will pay.  The child is seven years old 25 and has a hard time writing the application.

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  Isn't it normal for us to

3 refer to the parent as the applicant, even though the

4 child doesn't?

5             MR. DUGGAN:  Yes.

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  And it is not normal for us

7 to refer to the applicant for college as the parent,

8 even though, unfortunately, the parent foots the bill?

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was this corporation a

10 minor?

11             MR. DUGGAN:  What?

12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The corporation that

13 applied, was it a minor?

14             MR. DUGGAN:  No, but the point 

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Change the  the

16 sevenyearold to a young man who is applying to law

17 school, who is already shaving, for Pete's sake.

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  But my point 

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is Justice Breyer the

20 applicant?

21             MR. DUGGAN:  He may.

22             JUSTICE BREYER:  I think our point for both

23 of us is that how we use the word "applicant" depends

24 upon the context.

25             MR. DUGGAN:  Very true.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
12 1             JUSTICE BREYER:  And, therefore, what is it 2 about the context of the guarantor of a loan that makes 3 it reasonable in that context to call that person an 4 applicant? 5             MR. DUGGAN:  Let me answer that question 6 directly. 7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I don't agree with 8 the hypothesis.  Why do you accept the hypothesis?  What 9 it means depends upon the  upon the context?  It means 10 what it means.  Now, whether the person is an applicant 11 within the understood meaning of "applicant," that 12 depends upon the context, but the meaning of the word 13 doesn't change. 14             MR. DUGGAN:  May I address the questions, 15 Mr. Chief Justice? 16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's all right 17 with me. 18             (Laughter.) 19             MR. DUGGAN:  Thank you so much. 20             The definition of the word "apply" is to 21 appeal to a request.  And in this particular case, I 22 believe that anybody who signs a written contract that 23 says, I have independent obligations to perform under my 24 guaranty that make me jointly and severally liable to 25 repay the debt in full, and if I fail to perform, I
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
13 1 agree to repay the appliedfor debt in totality, I don't 2 know how in the world that person is not somebody who is 3 appealing to and requesting that credit be extended by 4 putting their own financial wherewithal and capacity to 5 repay the loan on the line based on their own 6 independent requirement to perform. 7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under your  under your 8 view  let me understand the theory of the case.  Let's 9 say that you prevail, that a guarantor is an applicant 10 and that there is a violation of the duty to the 11 guarantor and that there are five guarantors.  Can each 12 of the five guarantors bring a separate suit for 13 punitive damages?  And also  this is also part of my 14 question  can the loan be declared unenforceable? 15             MR. DUGGAN:  No, the loan cannot be declared 16 unenforceable under the laws that exist today.  The only 17 thing that could be declared unenforceable would be the 18 spousal guaranties which are deemed illegal under 19 Regulation B.  Not all of the guarantors can bring a 20 claim.  The husbands can only bring a claim to the 21 extent they suffer damage as a result of their wives 22 being required to be guarantors on the case. 23             Mr. Chief Justice, I see that my time is 24 limited.  I may like to reserve the remainder for 25 rebuttal, if there are no further questions.

14 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel. 2             MR. DUGGAN:  Thank you so much. 3            ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER 4               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 5             MR. FLETCHER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 6 and may it please the Court: 7             For 30 years, Regulation B has provided that 8 guarantors, cosigners, and other similar parties to 9 credit transactions, qualify as applicants, are entitled 10 to protection from discrimination under the Equal Credit 11 Opportunity Act and the Additional Parties rule.  That 12 longstanding regulation is reasonable, and it reflects a 13 reasonable interpretation of the Act's broad definition 14 of the term "applicant." 15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we've been 16 talking about applicants  is it  is the person an 17 applicant in the abstract?  But one of the important 18 things about context here is there are two terms, 19 "applicant" and "guarantor."  And that's the way it's 20 always worked in the industry.  Somebody in the industry 21 would not call a guarantor an applicant.  The person is 22 a guarantor.  So I just wonder how we can pluck 23 "applicant" out.  Obviously, in some sense, anybody who 24 is supporting the loan, you know, you can describe, 25 well, they're applying for it.  But there's a separate
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
15 1 term, "guarantor."  And if you ask somebody, well, what 2 is this person?  Is this person an applicant?  They 3 would say, no, it's a guarantor. 4             MR. FLETCHER:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the 5 term "guarantor" doesn't appear in the statute.  And I 6 don't think it's true that the term "applicant" and 7 "guarantor" have fixed meanings in the industry and that 8 you could never construe a guarantor to be an applicant. 9 I think, in fact, often, as we explain in our brief, 10 guarantors and cosigners might fill out the same 11 application and join together in the same application 12 that they submit to the borrower in seeking the loan. 13 And so I  I don't think there's an industry 14 understanding that you can't reasonably regard a 15 guarantor or a cosigner or another secondary obligor 16 who's playing that sort of  17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Wait.  Do you think 18 there's an industry understanding that there are 19 guarantors and there are applicants?  I mean, if you 20 weren't in the industry and you're looking at this, you 21 wouldn't call the Petitioner an applicant.  You'd call 22 her a guarantor. 23             MR. FLETCHER:  I think you  in 24 some  certainly, in some context, you might use the 25 two terms differently.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wouldn't you

16

2 call  wouldn't you use the word "borrower" instead of

3 applicant?

4             MR. FLETCHER:  I think certainly after the

5 loan had been extended, you would  you would use the

6 term "borrower."  But I think if you look at the  the

7 context in which Congress used the term, it wrote a very

8 broad statute.  It said, "It shall be unlawful for any

9 creditor to discriminate against any applicant with

10 respect to any aspect of a credit transaction."  And

11 then it defined an applicant to be any person who

12 applies to a creditor directly for an extension,

13 renewal, or continuation of credit.

14             JUSTICE ALITO:  Would you disagree that in

15 ordinary speech, an applicant is understood, as

16 Judge Colloton said, to be someone who is asking for

17 something for himself or herself?  And if you don't

18 agree with that, could you give me your best example of

19 the situation in ordinary speech in which the term

20 "applicant" is used to refer to someone who is not

21 asking for something personally?

22             MR. FLETCHER:  Justice Alito, I agree that

23 very often, applicant refers to the person who's going

24 to receive the thing that's being sought.  I don't

25 think, though  and this is what the other side has to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
17 1 convince you of  that it unambiguously excludes any 2 other meaning.  And in terms of my best examples in 3 terms of ordinary speech, I think the one that 4 Justice Breyer gave earlier was a good one. 5             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me come back to 6 that.  Suppose that this child is rejected for 7 kindergarten, and then the parent is glum the next day 8 at work.  And someone says, why are you down today? 9 Would the  would the parent say, well, I'm down today 10 because I was just rejected for this fancy kindergarten? 11             MR. FLETCHER:  I think you wouldn't say I 12 was rejected, but you might  13             JUSTICE ALITO:  My application was rejected. 14             MR. FLETCHER:  I think you very well might. 15 I think if you filled out the application, and you made 16 the request, and you were upset that it was denied, I 17 think it would be perfectly sensible to say my 18 application was denied. 19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Fletcher, in  in some 20 ways, the Agency itself has admitted that this is not 21 the most natural reading of the term.  When the Agency 22 explained why it was articulating this rule, it said, 23 well, the problem is that Section 706 of the Act confers 24 standing to sue only upon an aggrieved applicant.  And 25 so we have to come in and kind of fix that.
Alderson Reporting Company

18 1             And  and so, too, the regulation itself 2 talks about applicants and additional parties as though 3 the two are different.  And then the regulation, as I 4 think Justice Scalia said, says, well, this  this is 5 our definition of applicant, but it's really only for 6 this purpose, not throughout the statute.  And all of 7 those, it seems to me, are quasiadmissions that this is 8 not the most natural way to read the word "applicant." 9             MR. FLETCHER:  Justice Kagan, I'm glad you 10 brought that up because I very much disagree that that's 11 how the Agency has viewed this.  I think, in particular, 12 you referred to the way that the Agency described the 13 change it was making in 1985, when it amended the 14 regulation to expressly include guarantors for certain 15 purposes.  And you're right.  They said, we're doing 16 this because courts have ruled guarantors out of court. 17 But the reason that it said that was not that it 18 believed that guarantors were unambiguously excluded by 19 the statute or that it was rewriting the statute.  It 20 did that because between 1977 and 1985, the Agency's own 21 regulation had expressly said that applicants do not 22 include guarantors, cosigners, and other similar 23 parties.  And so the courts that had said that 24 guarantors didn't get to bring a suit were pointing to 25 the Agency's regulation and says this statute only
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 protects applicants.  And the Agency is telling us

19

2 expressly that you as a guarantor aren't an applicant.

3             And so the Agency came in in 1985, and it

4 said, our own regulation, our previous version of our

5 regulation, which excluded guarantors, is creating this

6 problem, and we want to fix it by defining them to be

7 applicants.

8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you  you don't  you

9 don't solve a problem by  by fixing a definition.  I

10 mean, why was it a problem?  It  it was not a problem

11 if applicant meant what the prior regulation said it

12 meant.  Why was that a problem?

13             MR. FLETCHER:  Well, I think  I think it

14 was a problem because it left guarantors who had been

15 improperly required to sign loan documents without a

16 remedy.

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah.  But that's what the

18 law read.  I mean, if that's a problem, it was a problem

19 with the law.

20             MR. FLETCHER:  Well, that was a problem with

21 the Agency's own prior regulation, which expressly

22 excluded guarantors.  When the Agency  and let me step

23 back.

24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I just start?  Why

25 did you have to pass the first regulation at all?  What

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 caused you  if it was as clear as Justice Scalia

20

2 believes, why did you need the regulation at all saying

3 it doesn't include?

4             MR. FLETCHER:  So if I could just give you a

5 little bit of the history of how the regulation

6 developed.  The Equal Credit Opportunity Act was passed

7 in 1974.  When the Agency, the Federal Reserve Board,

8 first passed regulations in 1975, it just incorporated

9 the statutory definition of applicant in relevant part.

10 It didn't speak to the guarantor question one way or

11 another.

12             But in 1976, just a year later, it added a

13 substantive provision that made clear that at that time

14 in 1976, it regarded guarantors as applicants.  It said

15 that for purposes of a provision of the

16 regulation  and this is something we cite at Page 7 of

17 our brief  for purposes of a provision of the

18 regulation, it required creditors to give notice of

19 their credit decisions to applicants.  If you have

20 multiple applicants, creditor, you can just give notice

21 to one of them.  But then the regulation provided you

22 may not give that notice to an applicant who is a

23 secondary obligor, such as a surety or a guarantor.

24             So the Agency's first interpretation was

25 actually that the  the plain language of the statute,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 which had been incorporated into the regulation,

21

2 included guarantors.

3             JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't it correct that this

4 issue matters only where there are adverse  where

5 the  the borrower and the guarantor have adverse

6 interests?  And if that's correct, how often does that

7 arise?

8             MR. FLETCHER:  So Justice Alito, I think

9 it's particularly important where the borrower and the

10 guarantor have adverse interests for the  for

11 instance, if there's been a divorce.  And so the

12 spouses' interests are no longer aligned.  Then I think

13 it's very, very important.  But I don't think it matters

14 only in those cases.  And this goes to  to the

15 question that Justice Kagan raised earlier, which is why

16 does this matter?

17             And the reason that it matters is that a

18 guarantor who's improperly required to provide a

19 guaranty suffers a unique economic injury that is not

20 suffered by the applicant.  So in  in a common case,

21 the lender says, I won't extend this loan without a

22 signature from your spouse.  And everyone agrees that

23 that's a violation of Regulation B, and everyone agrees

24 that that's not permitted.

25             And if, in that case, the spouse provides

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the signature, as often happens, then the primary

22

2 applicant, the borrower, hasn't suffered any harm at

3 all.  They've gotten the loan that they wanted.  So they

4 have suffered discrimination in some sense, and they

5 would have a claim in some sense.  But in many cases,

6 they're not going to have economic damages to assert in

7 court.

8             The guarantor, on the other hand, oftentimes

9 will have that obligation on her credit report

10 immediately.  It could adversely affect her credit

11 scores immediately.  And as we explain in our brief, if

12 there's a default on the underlying loan, then that's

13 going to be a black mark that's going to tarnish the

14 guarantor or the cosigner's credit going forward even if

15 she ultimately pays the debt.

16             JUSTICE KAGAN:  One of the things that

17 Judge Posner said against your interpretation is that

18 this actually creates liability on a scale that Congress

19 wouldn't have expected because if you are right, the

20 guarantor can come in and  and declare the entire loan

21 invalid, and  and the damages would be much higher

22 than it is for the borrower himself.  I mean,

23 what's  what's the answer to that?

24             MR. FLETCHER:  So I think 

25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is there an answer?  It's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 just like, well, that's what it is.

23

2             MR. FLETCHER:  Well, I think the  the

3 first answer is that that  the availability of that

4 remedy of allowing a guarantor to assert and actually

5 invalidate the guaranty that's been illegally required,

6 that won't be resolved one way or the other by the way

7 you answered this question today, which is just are

8 guarantors reasonably regarded as applicants as they've

9 been defined for 30 years?

10             But  but I understand, though, why you

11 would be interested because it is a related question of

12 what remedies might guarantors have available.  And we

13 think the answer to Judge Posner's question in that case

14 is that there's nothing at all unreasonable about

15 requiring a lender that has improperly demanded a

16 guaranty to not be able to enjoy the benefit of that

17 guaranty.  As we explained at the end of our brief,

18 that's been the enforcing agency's longstanding policy

19 when the FDIC or the Federal Reserve Board or other

20 agencies conduct examinations of the books of banks and

21 when they find violations of the additional party's rule

22 like this.

23             The remedy that they apply is to require the

24 bank to release the improper guaranty, or in cases 

25 and I think this is another important point 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
24 1 Regulation B doesn't prohibit spousal signatures under 2 all circumstances.  To the extent that what the bank 3 wants to do is ensure that in the event of a default, 4 it's going to be able to reach specific property that 5 the primary applicant is relying on, it can require a 6 signature from the spouse, not for personal liability, 7 but just to allow it to reach the property that is being 8 relied upon to support the loan. 9             And so if  10             JUSTICE BREYER:  So  11             MR. FLETCHER:  I was just going to say, so 12 in that case, I think the proper remedy wouldn't be to 13 void the loan altogether.  It would be to give the 14 lender what it had the right to demand, which was a more 15 limited instrument. 16             I'm sorry, Justice Breyer. 17             JUSTICE BREYER:  Can  can you explain 18 quickly  I'm now uncertain.  I accept the point that I 19 could be a rejected application for kindergarten on 20 behalf of my  I've said  I've got that.  But what is 21 this actually about? 22             The law says you cannot discriminate against 23 a borrower, for example  for example  by saying that 24 you, the borrower, has to  have to have a guarantor 25 from someone you're married to.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. FLETCHER:  Right.

25

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what the law says.

3             MR. FLETCHER:  It says you can't

4 discriminate against any applicant with respect to any

5 aspect of a credit transaction.  Yes.

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  And this has been

7 interpreted to include you cannot say to a married

8 person you have to have the marriage  the spouse sign.

9             MR. FLETCHER:  That's correct.

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So that's where

11 we start.  Now, if the applicant were just the applicant

12 for the credit himself, what would be wrong with that?

13 Then you'd say, well, the person who's hurt here among

14 the people  just as if, for example, when you run a

15 train into a  into a wall, there are a lot of people

16 hurt.  So if the person  namely, the spouse  really

17 is hurt, why does  why does she have to be an

18 applicant?  Why can't you just sue for harm as a

19 result  caused as a result of the forbidden

20 discrimination?

21             MR. FLETCHER:  So the statutory cause of

22 action gives any applicant a right to sue.

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  I know.  But why wouldn't

24 you sue if you're  if you're  if you're directly

25 injured as a result of a  of an unlawful act?  Which

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 is what the regulation 

26

2             MR. FLETCHER:  So  and I think the

3 Petitioner has suggested that there might be State law

4 causes of action, but I think in terms of having the

5 right 

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  Not State, just right under

7 this statute, you say I have suffered harm, I was about

8 to take this ticket, and everyone admits I would have

9 taken the money, invested in the lottery, and would

10 today be a millionaire.  Hard to prove, but nonetheless,

11 if proved, maybe she was hurt.  So why can't she sue?

12             MR. FLETCHER:  Because the statute gives the

13 right to sue to applicant.

14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it doesn't say 

15 okay.  So you're 

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  To an aggrieved  to an

17 aggrieved 

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  To have gotten too far,

19 and so your whole idea here is say she's an applicant,

20 too.

21             MR. FLETCHER:  Right.

22             JUSTICE BREYER:  And then she can sue.

23             MR. FLETCHER:  She's an applicant.

24             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now  now, it seems to me

25 maybe you're pushing the edge of the word "applicant" as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
27 1 they did intend it in the statute.  That's  that is a 2 problem. 3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  On that point  4             JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you give an example? 5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   are there places in 6 the  in this statute where guarantor and applicant is 7 a distinction that has to be made?  In other words, 8 under your view, does applicant include guarantor in 9 every part of the statute? 10             MR. FLETCHER:  So in our view, there's no 11 place where reading applicant to include guarantor 12 wouldn't work or would create a problem.  What the 13 Agency has done, when it amended its regulation to 14 include guarantors, is it asked for comments on whether 15 there are specific provisions of the regulation that 16 guarantors should be exempted from.  And in response to 17 those comments, it decided to exercise its broad 18 rulemaking authority to exempt them and to not treat 19 them as applicants for purposes of other provisions of 20 the statute.  So I don't think  21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where  where does it get 22 that discretion?  I mean, it says applicant in the 23 statute.  When it says applicant, the Agency has 24 discretion to say, oh, yeah, it says applicant, but 25 sometimes we're going to ignore that.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
28 1             MR. FLETCHER:  Yes, Justice Scalia.  It's 2 under the grant of a rulemaking authority which is in 3 Section 1691(b), subsection (A). 4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which says what? 5             MR. FLETCHER:  Which says that, "The bureau 6 shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes 7 of this"  "this subchapter, and the regulations may 8 contain, but are not limited to, such classifications, 9 differentiation, or other provision and may provide for 10 such adjustments and exceptions for any class of 11 transaction." 12             JUSTICE BREYER:  But have you got an 13 example?  Any example at all from a magazine having to 14 do with finance, from anything you can find where, in 15 fact, in the context of financial transactions, there 16 are references to a surety, a guarantor, or a mortgage 17 insurance, there is a reference to such a person with 18 the word "applicant"? 19             MR. FLETCHER:  So here's my best example, 20 Justice Breyer.  They're on Page 24 of their brief  my 21 brief.  And they don't use the word "applicant," but 22 they talk about who's regarded as receiving an extension 23 of credit.  And this is our secondary argument, 24 Justice Alito. 25             Even if you think that an applicant is only
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 someone who seeks something for themselves, we think a 2 guarantor is reasonably regarded as seeking an extension 3 of credit for themselves.  As we explain on page 24 of 4 our brief, for purposes of the Fair Credit Reporting 5 Act, lenders and other banks rely every day on reading 6 the Fair Credit Reporting Act to mean that the same 7 definition of credit  of credit, which refers to the 8 extension of credit, includes a guaranty. 9             The authority in the Fair Credit Reporting 10 Act that allows a lender, who has a prospective 11 guarantor before him, to look at that guarantor's credit 12 report is a provision of the Fair Credit Reporting Act 13 that says you can pull the credit report of someone 14 who's going to receive an extension of credit in 15 connection with the transaction. 16             And we cite there a 2001 letter from all of 17 the banking regulators that explains in detail why it is 18 reasonable to regard guarantors and other secondary 19 obligors as receiving an extension of credit, and why, 20 in fact, that's essential to the effective 21 administration of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 22             Thank you. 23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 24             Mr. McAllister. 25          ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

30

2             MR. McALLISTER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may

3 it please the Court:

4             This is a Chevron step one case.  The FRB

5 gets to be the sorcerer's apprentice, but not the

6 sorcerer.  It's trying to rewrite the statute here, not

7 define ambiguous terms.  The government takes the view

8 that the statute has to unambiguously exclude

9 guarantors.  That's the wrong starting point.

10             The question is simply:  Is the statute

11 ambiguous with respect to whom it covers?  Under the

12 government's view, every statutory definition would have

13 to have two parts; the part that defines who is an

14 applicant, and part two that says who's not an

15 applicant.

16             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. McAllister, I take it if

17 there were two borrowers, you would include both of

18 them, both would have a cause of action?

19             MR. McALLISTER:  Absolutely.  They're  if

20 they're  if they're joint applicants, the statute 

21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  They're joint applicants.

22             MR. McALLISTER:   covers them.

23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  How about if they're

24 cosigners?  I take it that  is  a cosigner is

25 somebody who's jointly and severally liable, but is

Alderson Reporting Company

1 not himself 

Official

31

2             MR. McALLISTER:  Is not an applicant.

3             JUSTICE KAGAN:   receiving the money.

4             MR. McALLISTER:  Exactly.  So 

5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  You would  you would count

6 that out.

7             MR. McALLISTER:  Count that out.  They 

8 they are not an applicant.  So the statute refers to

9 applicants, and certainly, the regs and the statute

10 contemplate the joint applicants who go in together.

11 They want the credit together, and they have an

12 obligation to make the repayments, either or both.  But

13 a cosigner is different.

14             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And this is so even if the

15 cosigner had to file the exact same kind of papers and

16 do everything else that the borrower himself had to do?

17             MR. McALLISTER:  Exactly.  And  and part

18 of that is because of the statute's definition of

19 credit, which no one has talked about.  But the

20 statute's definition of credit, that is defined

21 explicitly just like applicant.  And it's part of the

22 applicant definition.  And credit means a right to defer

23 payment of debt.  A cosigner and a guarantor never have

24 a right to defer payment of debt.  If they become

25 responsible, they were responsible then.  So what that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
32 1 is contemplating, in our view, is the borrower.  It's 2 the person who's making the regular payments.  That's 3 what's encompassed in the statutory definition. 4             I would refer the Court also to comparable 5 civil rights statutes of this era.  In particular, the 6 Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Housing Act, the AIDS 7 Discrimination and Employment Act.  All of them use the 8 word "person" to describe who can bring a claim.  In the 9 ECOA, Congress very deliberately chose something 10 narrower, and not only did it choose it, but it 11 expressly defined it in the statute. 12             And we describe this as a gateway provision. 13 We don't argue that the Fed doesn't have broad authority 14 in many respects in implementing the ECOA.  But what it 15 does not have the authority to do is to rewrite the 16 statutory definition that Congress very deliberately and 17 precisely put in the statute. 18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So suppose  suppose that I 19 have a credit card, and now I get married, and I'd like 20 a secondary credit card for my spouse, and I apply to 21 the credit card company for a secondary credit card. 22 Who's  who's the applicant there? 23             MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I think you are still 24 the applicant there. 25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So even though I receive no
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 direct benefit, the credit is actually given to my

33

2 spouse now?

3             MR. McALLISTER:  Well, if they have the

4 ability to charge on the account same as you, then I

5 guess they would, in effect, become a joint applicant at

6 that point in time.

7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  They would effectively

8 become a joint applicant, even though I'm the only one

9 who's filling out the  the  all the papers.

10             MR. McALLISTER:  But the statute

11 contemplates that there can be situations in which a

12 thirdparty requests credit on behalf of another, and

13 that's another reason why we think guarantors are not

14 included because it is contemplating, for example, the

15 parent who goes in, says I want to arrange a loan for my

16 son or daughter to buy their first car.  The son or

17 daughter is actually ultimately going to be the

18 applicant.  The parent may well be a cosigner.  The

19 parent may initiate the transaction, but the  the

20 recipient of the credit, the right to defer payment of

21 the debt, is an applicant.

22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess  I guess  you

23 know  and this is a  a functional point for sure.

24 But it doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense that

25 suppose a lender doesn't want to provide credit to a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 married woman because it has all these sex, gender

34

2 stereotypes in the lender's head or  and the lender

3 couldn't require that the  that the husband be listed

4 as a  a joint applicant, but could require that the

5 husband be listed as a cosigner, even though the effect

6 of those two things are exactly the same, which is that

7 it's a requirement that the spouse essentially become

8 joint and severally liable for the loan.

9             MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I  I don't think

10 there is a difference.  I think the cosigner is in the

11 same category as the guarantor.  But here's  here's my

12 fundamental answer to your question, Justice Kagan, is

13 the purpose of this statute is abundantly evident.  The

14 language we think, but if you look at the legislative

15 history, the point was to get the credit in the hands of

16 people who were being denied, in particular, women.

17 That is the applicant.  So the way the statute is

18 intended to work, and works just fine with the

19 definition of applicant we use, is to say when that

20 person shows up, and the bank says, oh, no credit for

21 you unless a spouse signs, the violation has occurred

22 then.  And the discrimination is against the person who

23 wanted to borrow the money.  The government may wish

24 that the discriminatory provisions were broader than

25 that, but that's the way the statute works.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
35 1             So the applicant has a claim, the borrower 2 who is told you need more signatures  otherwise, you 3 could imagine scenarios  I think one of the amicus 4 briefs spins out one where, say, the person comes in and 5 the bank says, I need  because you're of a certain 6 religion or a certain race, I need 15 guarantors for 7 your  well, all 15 guarantors can simply say no, but 8 under their view, all 15 guarantors actually have a 9 claim under the ECOA.  And that just makes no sense. 10 That's far beyond what Congress  11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's not  that's not 12 quite accurate, because the only person who's given a 13 right not to be discriminated against is the 14 applicant  an applicant on the basis of marital 15 status. 16             MR. McALLISTER:  No, Your Honor.  No, that's 17 not true.  I mean, the statute covers  covers marital 18 status, sex, religion, race, age even.  So there are a 19 number of prohibited bases.  The original statute was 20 sex and marital status, but then in 1976, it was 21 expanded to cover other  22             JUSTICE BREYER:  Mr. McAllister, why  why 23 does it matter?  A person sitting at the table says, 24 please lend me $10,000.  Now, the  the lender says, I 25 want you to have someone from a forbidden category as a

36 1 guarantor.  So he's outside, he walks in and he says, 2 I'll guaranty this loan.  I want you to lend him $10,000 3 and I'll guaranty it. 4             Well, why hasn't that guarantor applied for 5 a loan to another person? 6             MR.

McALLISTER:  So it's  11             JUSTICE BREYER:  It's the person sitting at 12 the table, then others come up, and they have to get  13 there's like sureties, they're like guarantors, there 14 are a bunch of different things. 15             MR. McALLISTER:  None of them  16             JUSTICE BREYER:  It seemed to me some of 17 them you thought might. 18             MR. McALLISTER:  None of them actually 19 should be included.  And if I suggested that  ours is 20 a straightforward definition adhering to the statute. 21 You can certainly have joint applicants, joint 22 borrowers, but that means they are receiving the benefit 23 of the credit directly.  Credit is flowing to them. 24             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  I mean, the thing I 25 don't get is why can't you apply?  An applicant means a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 person who applies for something.  So why can't you

37

2 apply for the thing being, give some money to this other

3 person?

4             MR. McALLISTER:  Because, again, I come back

5 to the statutory definition, Justice Breyer, which says

6 you are applying for credit.  And the statute defines

7 credit.  So it says credit is the right to defer payment

8 of a debt.

9             And the person who has asked for 

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  And you say, I am

11 applying for just that.  And I am applying for just

12 that.  My application, here it is, in writing, is that I

13 want you to do just that for Smith, who's sitting at the

14 table.

15             MR. McALLISTER:  And in our view, the

16 statute means Smith is the applicant.

17             JUSTICE BREYER:  Because?

18             MR. McALLISTER:  Because, again, the  the

19 

20             JUSTICE BREYER:  The person who filled  I

21 don't want you to repeat yourself.  You don't have to.

22             MR. McALLISTER:  Okay.

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  But I mean, you see where

24 I'm having the problem, that Jones, who came in, he

25 fills out the papers and he signs the signature, he puts

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
38 1 in all the things and he says, please, please, please 2 give that credit to Smith. 3             MR. McALLISTER:  Well, again, I don't think 4 that  5             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why hasn't  he's applied. 6 He's applied for the credit to go to Smith.  I mean, in 7 English, hasn't he?  Why not? 8             MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I  I think that's 9 in a sense contrary, really, to the  the most ordinary 10 understandings of the word "applicant."  Of course, 11 we've got a statutory definition. 12             If I go back to the university admissions 13 process  14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  The  the 15 definition, the common definition, the Chief has defined 16 it that way, but the only dictionary that uses it in the 17 way you want is Webster's Third.  Every other 18 dictionary  and Webster's Third has been criticized by 19 at least one of my colleagues, if not more.  All right? 20             MR. McALLISTER:  I'm aware of that. 21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a terrible dictionary. 22             (Laughter.) 23             MR. McALLISTER:  I'm aware of that. 24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All the others don't use 25 a direct benefit language.  They all say you're just
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 asking for an extension of credit.  And they don't

39

2 suggest it has to be for yourself, it could be  you're

3 asking for an extension of credit for anyone.

4             So I  I mean, I'm  I'm quarreling with

5 the  with your reliance on some common understanding

6 of a word.

7             MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I come back 

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You've got cosigners,

9 you've got parents who  who sign as cosigners rental

10 agreements for their kids.  They're not getting the

11 benefit of the apartment.  Nobody believes that they are

12 using the apartment.  They're doing it to bolster up the

13 credit of their child.

14             So I don't know why applicant can't mean, in

15 common parlance, that you're asking for credit to be

16 extended to anyone, whether it's you or  or another

17 person.

18             MR. McALLISTER:  Perhaps that's the key,

19 Justice Sotomayor, is that you're talking common

20 parlance.  In my view, common parlance is the definition

21 that  that we assert and that the statute asserts.

22 Judge 

23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then why did  why did

24 the Federal Reserve Board initially  specifically

25 exclude guarantors?  If it was so clear that applicant

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
40 1 excludes guarantors, why did the Federal Reserve Board 2 do something so unnecessary to specifically exclude 3 them? 4             MR. McALLISTER:  Because I think they 5 created confusion, Justice Ginsburg.  So I agree with my 6 colleague, Mr. Fletcher, that there was a reg for a 7 short period of time that suggested in one particular 8 setting, multiple applicants, who do you give notice to? 9             The Fed put in a  some language that said, 10 well, don't give to  notice to applicants such as 11 secondary obligors, such as guarantors. 12             The Fed then, a couple minutes later, 13 proposed maybe we should just make this a general rule 14 that guarantors are included.  They took in notice and 15 comment, and a few months later they said, oh, we've 16 really sort of stirred up the pot here.  Let's just make 17 clear that guarantors and secondary obligors are not 18 included.  And that's why we got the 1976 version. 19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr.  Mr. McAllister, in 20 Corbin on Contracts, when they talk about guaranties, 21 they say, in most cases of guaranty contracts, the offer 22 comes from the guarantor requesting the giving of credit 23 to a principal debtor. 24             So Corbin on Contracts is  clearly thinks 25 that the guarantor is a requestor, is an applicant for
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 credit, and just to a thirdparty, to the principal

41

2 debtor.

3             But why  why  I mean, that's a pretty,

4 you know, creditspecific definition of what it means to

5 apply for credit.  And including, pretty clearly,

6 guarantors.

7             MR. McALLISTER:  Well, that's  that 

8 that is a  what Corbin says.  But again, I would come

9 back to guarantors do not sign the same document as the

10 borrower.  They are not liable in the same way.  They

11 have a separate contract with the lender, which the

12 borrower is not even party to the guarantor's contract.

13             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, do you think that it's

14 really contingent on that, on exactly which contract you

15 signed?  I mean, these folks give you a lot of

16 information, they sign their names to a lot of

17 information, and  I mean, unlike the usual guarantor

18 case where the guarantor is only liable if there's a

19 default, here the guarantor is jointly and severally

20 liable, much like a cosigner is.

21             Or at any rate, cosigners are jointly and

22 severally 

23             MR. McALLISTER:  That's  cosigners are

24 jointly and severally liable.

25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And you want to put them in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the same box, too.  So it doesn't really matter 

42

2             MR. McALLISTER:  Right.  But that is a

3 mischaracterization.  These are guaranties 

4             JUSTICE KAGAN:  It doesn't matter.

5             MR. McALLISTER:   that are not joint and

6 severally liable.

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  I bet we could find 50 like

8 that.  This is the collegiate dictionary.  Maybe that

9 makes it too simpleminded.

10             (Laughter.)

11             JUSTICE BREYER:  But the  the  it says,

12 an applicant  this is very helpful  an applicant is

13 a person who applies for something, all right?  We're

14 not making too much progress.

15             But then when we go to apply, the second

16 definition down here, is to make an appeal or request.

17 Does the guarantor make an appeal or request?  Yes.

18 Especially in the form of written application.  Even

19 writes it, e.g., for a job.  No, doesn't apply for a

20 job, doesn't have to be a job.

21             Do you see, it's a general kind of thing,

22 and we're at step one of Chevron, and we're only talking

23 about what 

24             MR. McALLISTER:  And we're talking 

25             JUSTICE BREYER:   the meaning.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I assume that that

43

2 definition would  would cover my letter to somebody

3 urging that person to hire somebody else.

4             MR. McALLISTER:  I think that's

5 exactly right.  Yep.

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would be  I would be an

7 applicant under  under that definition, which is, of

8 course, absurd.

9             MR. McALLISTER:  And two  two things about

10 that absurdity, Justice Scalia.  One absurdity is this

11 

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, he's not asking

13 for money.

14             MR. McALLISTER:  Pardon?

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He's recommending

16 someone, but this is about an extension of credit.

17             MR. McALLISTER:  Right.  But still, you'd be

18 asking for the same result that the applicant is

19 seeking.  So I mean, I take the question in that

20 fashion.

21             But, two  two things about that 

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, it would be a

23 different thing if the statute said, don't discriminate

24 on the basis of someone being a Justice.  That  that's

25 what you 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
44 1             MR. McALLISTER:  It should say that, but  2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The analogy would work 3 only if you did that, right? 4             MR. McALLISTER:  But  but what I was going 5 to say is the government concedes that the statute uses 6  well, in fact, they didn't say this, but I believe 7 the statute uses the word "applicant" something like 50 8 times, and only for one purpose do they say this 9 definition should apply.  That runs counter to 10 presumptions this Court has long stated.  The statute is 11 used repeatedly  12             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I thought that the 13 government answered that question differently.  I  I 14 thought their position was that if they prevail, their 15 definition of the word "applicant" to include guarantor 16 apply  A, applies across the board 50 times, and B, 17 makes the Act perfectly workable. 18             Did  did  19             MR. McALLISTER:  Neither one is  I don't 20 think either one is true  21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You may disagree  22             MR. McALLISTER:   Justice Kennedy. 23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Maybe I misunderstood 24 their answer. 25             MR. McALLISTER:  Oh, I don't think they say
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 that it would apply across all 50 uses.  They said we 2 could change it  and actually, they're suggesting they 3 could have 49 other definitions of applicant.  Every 4 time it's used somewhere else in the statute, they could 5 define it differently for that purpose. 6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And can you give me an 7 example of where it would be really contrary to a 8 sensible interpretation of the Act to use the term 9 "guarantor" and  10             MR. McALLISTER:  For example  11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   "applicant" as 12 synonymous, other than for what we're talking about 13 here? 14             MR. McALLISTER:  Well, for example, giving 15 notice of adverse action.  I mean, the Agency itself has 16 said a guarantor cannot be subject to adverse action, 17 and yet you would have  18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I frankly  I frankly 19 don't believe why that makes the statute unworkable.  If 20 I'm a guarantor of someone's debt, I want to know when 21 they're in default because I'm going to call them up and 22 start  if it's my child, I'm going to start 23 browbeating them, meaning  I don't know what the 24 rationale for that was, whether I agree with it or not. 25 But why does it make it unworkable?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1             MR. McALLISTER:  Well, it would  it is not 2 just that, Justice Sotomayor.  It's not just at some 3 point down the road.  Usually, this is focused on the 4 application itself.  So again, if you have the case of 5 multiple guarantors, the bank turns down the borrower, 6 then they're under obligation, if you take that view of 7 the statute, to notify everyone who had any connection 8 to the transaction.  But the Agency has long said that 9 is not required.  The Agency's commenter  if you look 10 at  if you look at supplement one, the interpretations 11 of the regs and other commentary by the agencies, except 12 for this purpose, the Agency always talks about 13 guarantors as different than joint applicants, 14 coborrowers.  No one in the industry would think of 15 these two things as the same. 16             To come back to the Chief  Mr. Chief 17 Justice's point, a bank would not say a borrower is 18 equivalent to a guarantor.  Not even close.  They're two 19 very different things. 20             JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  They certainly wouldn't 21 say a borrower is equivalent to a guarantor.  But the 22 question is whether an applicant is equivalent to  23             MR. McALLISTER:  They would say the person 24 who wants the credit, the applicant, is not the same as 25 a guarantor.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what  what 

47

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  The entire idea of a

3 guaranty contract, right, why is a guaranty agreement

4 even enforceable?  Is it there is consideration, and the

5 consideration has to do with the fact that credit is

6 going to a thirdparty, right?  And so the guarantor is

7 stepping in and saying, I'm asking for something and I'm

8 getting something when I enter into this contract, and

9 that's the credit will go not to me, but to a third

10 party.

11             So the question I think is, like, why should

12 that be, you know  just because it's to a third party,

13 the appeal, the request to the application is as to a

14 third party rather than to yourself, why that should

15 make any difference if the question is just what does

16 applicant mean?  Applicant doesn't have to be for

17 yourself.

18             MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I  I agree that's

19 the consideration for the guaranty.  But what that opens

20 the door to, Your Honor, is there have been 60 or 70

21 reported ECOA decisions since the change in 1985.  More

22 than half of those are within the last five years.

23 After the 2008 crash, massive defaults, this is coming

24 up more and more for banks as a defense.

25             And if I can just have one minute, I'll tell

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 you where this leads for banks.  So if the rule is a

48

2 spousal guaranty can be voided  and that's what  the

3 relief sought.  They're not asking for damages.  They

4 want to invalidate, void the entire guaranty.  That was

5 Judge Posner's point.  So if that is the rule, what is a

6 bank to do when a married person comes in and seeks

7 credit?

8             Well, one thing the bank may do is say only

9 secured credit because I cannot rely on any guaranty.  I

10 can't even rely on a spousal guaranty if the spouse says

11 I want to give the guaranty, because when this goes in a

12 bad direction and it's time to collect, then years

13 later, that spouse may do what these spouses have done

14 and say I was required to do this, this was a violation

15 of the statute.  And at a minimum, the lender is then

16 engaged, as this lender has been, in extensive

17 litigation costs just to even try to resolve the

18 situation.

19             All of that leads to lenders are going to be

20 less likely to want to  to lend to married couples

21 except if they are secure in their loans.  And that may

22 mean you have to put up assets, a guaranty no longer

23 suffices, and it may mean you have to get more

24 guarantors because they can't rely on the spouse.  None

25 of that furthers the purpose of the ECOA, which was to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
49 1 get the credit in the hands of people who were at that 2 time being discriminated against. 3             So the fundamental problem with Reg B is it 4 opens the door.  And now that the lawyers have 5 discovered this provision and are bringing it up 6 regularly, it will have a dramatic impact on the credit 7 industry. 8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  On the  on the question 9 of the guarantor entering a contract just as the 10 borrower enters a contract, the two contracts are quite 11 different.  The borrower enters a bilateral contract, I 12 promise to pay back the money if you  with interest if 13 you promise to lend me the money.  The guarantor 14 is  is asking for a unilateral contract.  The 15 guarantor is just saying, I make no promises, but if you 16 lend money to this person that I'm guarantying and that 17 person defaults, I'll make good.  That's  that's a 18 unilateral contract, which doesn't bind the  the 19 lender at all.  It's if the lender chooses to do that, 20 I'll stand good for the  for the default. 21             The two contracts are quite different.  And 22 in that respect, you can't call both  both of them 23 applicants just because they both  they both have 24 contracts.  Of course they both have contracts. 25             MR. McALLISTER:  I agree with that,
Alderson Reporting Company

2             And unless the Court has further questions,

3 I would ask that you affirm the decision of the Eighth

4 Circuit.

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.

6             Mr. Duggan, you have four minutes.

7            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. DUGGAN

8               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9             MR. DUGGAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10 and may it please the Court:

11             I think the primary answer to talk about, to

12 start with, is these guaranties are not simply

13 guaranties of the performance of the borrower.  They are

14 separate, independent performance required by the

15 guarantor under the guaranty.  The guarantor must pay

16 its creditors on time.  The guarantor must provide

17 financial statements to the lender.  The guarantor must

18 fulfill all other obligations and any other agreement

19 that the guarantor has with the lender.  If the

20 guarantor fails to perform any one of those single,

21 independent requirements of performance under the

22 guaranty, the guarantor agrees to repay the debt in

23 full.  There is separate performance under the guaranty.

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could you ask  could you

25 respond to counsel's last point?  Why would a bank ever

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 decide to give a loan with a spousal guaranty?

51

2             MR. DUGGAN:  I'm not sure I 

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why would  why would a

4 bank do that?

5             MR. DUGGAN:  There's several circumstances.

6 Number one, husbands and wives can come under the

7 regulation safe harbors as joint applicants

8 contemporaneously and say we want joint credit.  It's

9 only a violation of the Act if the lender, once an

10 independent spouse comes forward and says I want credit,

11 says as a condition to me extending you the credit you

12 want, you must bring your spouse along.

13             The second thing is I think this regulation

14 has got to be the easiest regulation to comply with.  A,

15 B, C, 1, 2, 3.  There's safe harbors under the

16 regulation.  If a lender is relying upon jointly owned

17 assets of a husband and wife, the regulation and the

18 statute, 1691(d), create a specific safe harbor that

19 says get a security interest in the asset and don't get

20 a guaranty, or simply ask the spouse to waive her

21 marital interest in the jointlyowned property so that

22 if in fact you have to execute on that jointlyowned

23 property to collect the debt, you're permitted to do

24 that.  Two very simple safe harbors to comply with.

25             What they don't want you to do is to strap

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the spouse with the potential adverse credit in the

52

2 future where she has to use her income or her earnings

3 or her ability to get future credit to pay off either a

4 divorced or deceased spouse.  One of the rationales.

5 Makes a ton of sense.

6             Back to the other points that were made.

7 The application here, the dictionary definitions run the

8 gamut, but they all have two specific statements.

9 Appeal or request.  And the statute here says they

10 repeal  applies for an extension renewal of credit.

11 Doesn't say of credit to the borrower.  Doesn't say of a

12 loan to the borrower.  It says of credit generically.

13             And back to Justice Breyer's comments, in

14 fact, why in the world that somebody who becomes

15 contractually, jointly and severally liable to repay the

16 debt in full and says, I have my independent obligations

17 under my guaranty, and if I don't perform, you can

18 collect the entire debt from me, how is that person in

19 that context not saying to the lender, I am appealing to

20 you and requesting an extension of credit?  I'll go so

21 far as to say I'll stand behind the loan, and I have my

22 independent obligations to perform under the guaranty.

23 And if I don't perform, I'll pay.  That, to me, can be

24 nothing but an applicant.

25             Thank you so much for your time.  I'm happy
