 6 General Olson.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 9 MR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
 10 may it please the Court:
 11 The Ninth Circuit has created a new
 12 constitutional rule for guilty pleas that is neither
 13 required by the Constitution nor warranted by this Court's
 14 previous decisions. Its inevitable effect would be to
 15 complicate and expose to collateral attack confessions of
 16 guilt which -- which account for approximately 95 percent
 17 of all convictions in the Federal system and to stifle the
 18 market for plea bargains, which this Court has described
 19 as an essential component of the administration of
 20 justice.
 21 The Ninth Circuit held that an accused cannot
 22 enter a valid guilty plea unless he is first given all
 23 evidence in the prosecutor's possession which would have a
 24 reasonable probability of discouraging him from pleading
 25 guilty.

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 The Ninth Circuit's rule, new rule, is not a
 2 logical extension of the Brady -- Brady v. Maryland, which
 3 is premised on concern over the constitutional fairness of
 4 criminal trials. Brady and its progeny require disclosure
 5 only when necessary to ensure a fair trial. In fact, in
 6 Brady itself, the Court was explicit to point out that it
 7 -- that decision was premised on the avoidance of an
 8 unfair trial to the accused. The subsequent cases, which
 9 have expanded upon or interpreted or explained Brady, have
 10 been even more specific with respect to the limitations on
 11 the scope of Brady.
 12 In U.S. v. Agurs, the Court said the prosecutor
 13 will not have violated his constitutional duty unless his
 14 omission is of sufficient significance to result in the
 15 denial of a fair trial. 
 16 Something similar was said in U.S. v. Bagley. 
 17 Brady's purpose is not to displace the adversary system as
 18 the primary means by which truth is uncovered. If it did
 19 not deprive a defendant of a fair trial, there is no
 20 constitutional violation. 
 21 QUESTION: Can we get to your main argument
 22 about Brady, that is, Brady in all its aspects is a trial
 23 right, not a pretrial right, in view of the plea agreement
 24 in this case, which represents that you have already
 25 turned over the prime Brady material and the only question

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 is the impeaching material?
 2 MR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The
 3 agreement to which Justice Ginsburg is referring is set
 4 out -- the two paragraphs of that agreement --
 5 QUESTION: 45a and 46a of the petition for cert.
 6 MR. OLSON: Yes, and I also have it on -- on
 7 page 12 of the joint appendix. 
 8 QUESTION: What -- what --
 9 MR. OLSON: Page 12 of the joint appendix. It's
 10 the --
 11 QUESTION: -- the petition.
 12 MR. OLSON: It's -- it's on page 14a of the
 13 petition -- of the appendix to the petition for
 14 certiorari. 
 15 QUESTION: It's the Government's representation
 16 that any information establishing the factual innocence of
 17 the defendant known to the prosecutor has been turned over
 18 to the defendant. And so my question is, isn't that, at
 19 least in this case, a moot issue? You do have the
 20 question about the impeaching material.
 21 MR. OLSON: The answer to that, Justice
 22 Ginsburg, is that both in the Sanchez decision and in this
 23 case, the Ruiz decision, the Ninth Circuit went further
 24 and made it clear that it was applying the rule that it
 25 applied in this case to all exculpatory material which, if

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 known to the defendant, might cause the defendant not to
 2 plead guilty. Now, the undertaking that was made in the
 3 particular proposed agreement here went a little bit
 4 further in the direction of the defendant, which often
 5 happens. Prosecutors frequently will decide, for one
 6 reason or another, to give exculpatory information of some
 7 sort to a defendant. But the Ninth Circuit went further
 8 than that and made it clear that the rule that it was
 9 enunciating applied to all exculpatory material, including
 10 impeachment material, and that is the rule that's going to
 11 be applicable in the Ninth Circuit.
 12 So, even if this Court determined to limit its
 13 decision to the -- the narrower scope, as articulated in
 14 the second paragraph of that proposed agreement, we'd be
 15 back here next year because it's quite clear what the
 16 Ninth Circuit intends to do with its rule. 
 17 QUESTION: I -- I don't --
 18 QUESTION: The statement referred to on page
 19 14a, the Government represents -- that -- that was not
 20 pursuant to any court order, I take it, the Government
 21 turning that over? 
 22 MR. OLSON: No, it was not, Mr. Chief Justice. 
 23 This was a -- simply a -- a draft agreement which was, in
 24 fact, prepared in response -- as a result of and in
 25 response to the earlier Sanchez decision, which -- which

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the Ninth Circuit had articulated. This was an effort by
 2 the prosecutor --
 3 QUESTION: I was -- I was going to ask why --
 4 why is that second paragraph there? It wouldn't have
 5 occurred to me to --
 6 MR. OLSON: It's -- it's not in the record,
 7 Justice Scalia, but it's my understanding that it's
 8 something that is -- is developed particularly to deal
 9 with the Sanchez case which the Ninth Circuit had already
 10 decided, and the presumption that the Ninth -- the Ninth
 11 Circuit's Sanchez decision went so far and not as far as
 12 the -- that that covered the impeachment material, but not
 13 other exculpatory material in the reverse.
 14 So, however inartful this is, it was not in
 15 response, Mr. Chief Justice, to a court order or any other
 16 legal requirement, nor does it purport to articulate what
 17 the law is. It purports to undertake what the prosecutor
 18 voluntarily was willing to do with respect to this
 19 particular form of plea --
 20 QUESTION: Has this been used throughout the
 21 country --
 22 MR. OLSON: No. 
 23 QUESTION: -- or just --
 24 MR. OLSON: This is -- this was developed just
 25 in the San Diego -- the Southern District of California,

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 although other versions in other places, but there's no
 2 standard national form for plea agreements.
 3 QUESTION: I -- I know what you'd like is that
 4 we reach the question of this impeachment material and say
 5 there is no such right in a -- in a plea agreement
 6 context. But how would I even get there? They only get
 7 an appeal here if there's a violation of law. I never
 8 heard of a violation of law consisting of a judge refusing
 9 to depart.
 10 And then assuming that there is some violation
 11 of law in his refusal to depart, which I thought was
 12 discretionary, how could he possibly depart? And this is
 13 important to you. Because I don't see at the moment how
 14 it would ever be a justification to depart, that a
 15 defendant has entered into this program. I mean, I can't
 16 find anything in the guidelines where it says "you can
 17 depart for a reason such as," and then fill in the content
 18 of the program to get a two-level departure.
 19 So, how -- how do we get to your issue and what
 20 do I do about those two things which seem tremendous
 21 blocks? 
 22 MR. OLSON: The Ninth Circuit -- let me answer
 23 the jurisdictional point first. The Ninth Circuit
 24 perceived that it had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C.
 25 3742(a)(1). 

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: That's violation of law.
 2 MR. OLSON: A -- that the sentence was imposed
 3 or the --
 4 QUESTION: Yes, in violation of law. So, I
 5 would ask them. I'd say, what law? 
 6 MR. OLSON: And -- and that the Ninth Circuit
 7 perceived that the district court felt that it was barred
 8 by law from departing --
 9 QUESTION: There isn't much I can find in this
 10 record that says that. 
 11 MR. OLSON: And -- and that the Ninth Circuit
 12 felt that because this was a constitutional right that the
 13 defendant was -- had that was being withheld from the
 14 defendant because of the -- of the circumstances of this
 15 case, that the -- the district court erroneously presumed
 16 that it was prevented from going in a -- in a direction
 17 that the Ninth Circuit felt that it could go. 
 18 And I think that then ties in with your second
 19 -- your second question with respect to the sentencing
 20 guidelines and section 5K2. The -- the court felt -- the
 21 Ninth Circuit felt -- and it's not very clear, but -- and
 22 -- and the Government is not objecting to the -- the way
 23 the Ninth Circuit exercised jurisdiction at this point and
 24 is not opposing the court's decision with respect to
 25 jurisdiction at this point. 

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 The Ninth Circuit felt that under section 5K2 of
 2 the sentencing guidelines, this would be a -- mitigate --
 3 the -- the entry into the so-called fast track program was
 4 a mitigating circumstance of a kind or a degree not
 5 adequately taken into account by the guidelines in
 6 formulating the guidelines. It should result in a
 7 sentence different --
 8 QUESTION: Those are supposed to be individual
 9 things. I mean, in other words --
 10 MR. OLSON: Well, but -- yes.
 11 QUESTION: -- I -- I see -- normally you could
 12 say, okay, the Government doesn't oppose it. We'll get to
 13 the main issue. But these look like tremendous
 14 jurisdictional blocks to me. 
 15 MR. OLSON: It -- it -- I think the answer to
 16 that latter point with respect to the individual
 17 consideration is covered by the fact that this particular
 18 program, under the circumstances of this district, are --
 19 they may be -- it may be frequently occurring, but it's
 20 individualistic in the sense that entering into this
 21 program alleviates a substantial amount of work and -- and
 22 provides a substantial benefit to the prosecutor in that
 23 district without which the prosecutor may not be able to
 24 enforce the law on all of the responsibilities of the law.
 25 This is one of the most busy districts of the

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 United States because of the tremendous number of
 2 narcotics crimes coming in across the border, multiplied
 3 in a sense by the number of immigration violations that
 4 take place. So that this was an individualized
 5 circumstance in that district.
 6 Now, one could quibble about the appropriateness
 7 of that, but that's how the Ninth Circuit perceived it. 
 8 It perceived that it had jurisdiction on that basis, and
 9 we're not objecting to it. 
 10 It seems clear that not only, therefore, that
 11 not -- that this right is not required by or implicit
 12 within Brady, but that the language of the Court's
 13 decisions interpreting Brady make it clear that Brady is
 14 not supposed to go that far, that it only has to do with
 15 the rights at -- at trial. 
 16 Furthermore, the solution that the Ninth Circuit
 17 proposed with respect to this is both overly broad and
 18 underly inclusive. If the Court was concerned, as it said
 19 it was and as the respondent contends it should be, with
 20 the potential of innocent persons pleading guilty, the
 21 test itself, which is set out in the court's -- the -- the
 22 Ninth Circuit's opinion on page -- I think it's 15a of the
 23 appendix to the petition for certiorari. About midway
 24 through the page, the court says, the evidence is material
 25 under the test announced in this case if there is a

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 reasonable probability that but for the failure to
 2 disclose the Brady material, the defendant would have
 3 refused to plead and would have gone to trial.
 4 In other words, the test is not couched in terms
 5 of the potential innocence of the defendant or the risk
 6 that a defendant was -- was innocent. It's couched in
 7 terms of the tactical decision a defendant might make with
 8 respect to whether or not to go trial. 
 9 QUESTION: He should know what the house odds
 10 are before he -- before he rolls the dice by pleading
 11 guilty. 
 12 MR. OLSON: Precisely. In fact --
 13 QUESTION: Which is sort of a different concept
 14 from -- from what Brady was about. 
 15 MR. OLSON: Exactly, Justice Scalia. In fact,
 16 this Court has frequently said that -- that there are lots
 17 of risks involved in the -- in the defense of a case, a
 18 criminal case, and -- and there are risks and benefits and
 19 burdens and evaluations that must be taken into
 20 consideration.
 21 QUESTION: What is the Government's obligation
 22 with respect to advising the defendant or the court that
 23 the elements of an offense have -- have been committed? I
 24 -- in all these hypotheticals, the cocaine supposedly --
 25 there was supposed to be cocaine. It's really talcum

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 powder or something, and the Government knows that. What
 2 -- is this all taken care by rule 11 or --
 3 MR. OLSON: Well, I think it's taken care of in
 4 several ways. If the -- the Constitution gives the
 5 defendant a right to trial or a right to confront
 6 witnesses, a right to counsel, reasonably competent,
 7 informed counsel. Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of
 8 Criminal Procedure require a relatively exhaustive
 9 procedure where the court makes sure that the guilty plea
 10 is voluntary and intelligent and that the elements of the
 11 crime, of course, are involved in whether or not --
 12 QUESTION: Well, does the Government have to
 13 have a good faith belief that an offense has been
 14 committed? Is there -- is there some standard that binds
 15 the prosecution?
 16 MR. OLSON: The standard -- the standards for
 17 prosecutors in the United States -- for the United States
 18 are set forth in the -- the U.S. Attorneys Manual. It
 19 requires prosecutors not to bring a case unless they
 20 believe in good faith that there is a reasonable basis for
 21 the case that's being brought, in fact a reasonable basis
 22 for believing that there could be a conviction based upon
 23 evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. That's not a
 24 constitutional standard, Justice Kennedy.
 25 The constitutional standard is set forth in the

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 -- this Court's decisions with respect to the right to
 2 counsel, the right to trial, the right to intelligent
 3 information with respect to that.
 4 Rule 11, which is a -- which is a joint product
 5 of the courts and the -- and the legislature, sets out
 6 elaborate procedures pursuant to which a Federal judge
 7 will inquire with respect to the basis for the plea,
 8 explain the rights that the defendant has violated, and
 9 specifically requires the Federal court to find that
 10 there's a factual basis for the plea.
 11 Now, so that what I was saying was that is the
 12 remedy, the so-called remedy, that the Ninth Circuit has
 13 come up -- is -- is under-inclusive to the extent that if
 14 it's concerned about -- it's over-inclusive to the extent
 15 that it's concerned about innocent people pleading guilty
 16 because it doesn't go to the -- the factual innocent. It
 17 goes to the tactical decisions, the rolling of the dice,
 18 with respect to what are the chances of winning or losing
 19 in court. 
 20 QUESTION: Is this true, Mr. Solicitor General,
 21 that the rolling of the dice concept can apply to an
 22 innocent defendant as well? Supposing the -- the
 23 defendant and his lawyer know there are three eyewitnesses
 24 who were going to identify him. They also know he wasn't
 25 there, but there was somebody there who looks a lot like

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 him. And so they've got a choice of either taking the
 2 chance of getting acquitted, in the face of that evidence
 3 and based on their own denial -- he doesn't have an alibi
 4 -- and if he gets convicted, he has a very long sentence. 
 5 And he gets an offer of a plea bargain, a very short
 6 sentence. I don't suppose there's anything unethical
 7 about the lawyer trying to figure out what the odds are. 
 8 MR. OLSON: Well, no, there's nothing unethical
 9 about the lawyer trying to figure out what the odds are. 
 10 In fact, rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal
 11 Procedure give fairly elaborate rights of discovery to the
 12 defendant's counsel. And at that plea agreement, the
 13 judge will inquire with respect to whether there's a
 14 factual basis for the plea agreement.
 15 In fact, the judge in this case specifically
 16 addressed that question to the defendant, asked the
 17 defendant is it, indeed, true -- asked the defendant and
 18 then the counsel interceded and said, yes, she was
 19 bringing in her car 60 -- 60 pounds of marijuana. And
 20 then the judge turned to the defendant and said, is that
 21 true? And the defendant said, yes, I knew that it was --
 22 QUESTION: What is the lawyer -- what kind of
 23 advice is the lawyer to give? Hypothetically we have an
 24 innocent client who has a very severe risk of being
 25 convicted, and the lawyer would tell him there's going to

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 be a plea colloquy here, and if you don't acknowledge
 2 this, the plea bargain will go down the drain. Now, I
 3 guess he shouldn't tell him what -- I don't know exactly
 4 what the lawyer is supposed to do there. 
 5 MR. OLSON: Well, I don't -- I'm not sure
 6 either. It would all depend upon the circumstance. There
 7 is -- there is a possibility that this Court's recognized
 8 in the Alford decision a possibility of making a plea
 9 which is -- which is not incompatible with a defendant's
 10 assertion of innocence. But I think that in most cases
 11 the defendant is the one who will know more than anyone,
 12 the prosecutor or anyone else, whether the defendant is
 13 guilty. 
 14 QUESTION: Right, but I'm assuming a case in
 15 which the defendant knows he's not guilty, and
 16 nevertheless, there's a risk that, because the odds are so
 17 heavy if you get convicted, you go away for 20 years. If
 18 you have a 16-month plea bargain, you may want to not take
 19 the chance. 
 20 MR. OLSON: Well, I understand that, Justice
 21 Stevens. That may happen in a particular case. This
 22 Court said in Bagley that Brady's primary purpose is not
 23 to -- Brady's purpose is not to displace the adversary
 24 system as the primary means by which truth is -- as the
 25 primary means by which truth is uncovered. And I think

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that the answer to your question is that this system, no
 2 system is perfect or ever will be perfect, but we do have
 3 a panoply of constitutional rights. We insist that the
 4 defendant be adequately counseled. We insist that the
 5 judge through rule -- through rule 16 --
 6 QUESTION: So that in effect you're saying there
 7 may be a hypothetical situation out there, but we've got
 8 millions of cases. Also, we've got to balance the two,
 9 one against the other.
 10 MR. OLSON: Absolutely. And I must -- I must
 11 say that with respect to -- we're not talking about that
 12 case here. We're talking about a blanket rule which would
 13 apply in 57 -- you know, 57,000-some guilty pleas in the
 14 Federal system every year. 
 15 QUESTION: Well, the McMann and Brady cases too
 16 said that a defendant may have to make some hard choices.
 17 MR. OLSON: The Court said that explicitly.
 18 QUESTION: Well, if we're talking about
 19 balancing and basic fairness, I guess their argument would
 20 be with 57,000 cases going -- that's 85 percent or 90
 21 percent of all people plead guilty. Most of those are
 22 drug crimes. When the prosecutor sits there with a drug
 23 crime, he says, you plead guilty to a telephone count,
 24 it's 8 months, or I bring you to a mandatory minimum
 25 charge in trial and it's a minimum of 5 years. And under

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 those circumstances, the person is quite tempted to plead
 2 guilty irrespective of the facts. And therefore, it
 3 balances. As you were saying, it balances the system and
 4 it makes it somewhat more fair in that mine run situation
 5 to understand what are the chances of being convicted if I
 6 do go to trial. 
 7 MR. OLSON: Well --
 8 QUESTION: That would be the argument, I think,
 9 the other way in terms of fundamental fairness. 
 10 MR. OLSON: And I would answer that in two ways. 
 11 In the first place, I think the Chief Justice answered it
 12 by referring to the Brady v. United States case.
 13 QUESTION: So, you'd have to say that you're
 14 right, that that isn't what Brady said. But in taking --
 15 taking into account the reality of the criminal justice
 16 system, where 85 percent of the people plead guilty, and
 17 the prosecutor is armed with this tremendous don't plead
 18 guilty or else sentencing system, that this creates a kind
 19 of basic balance that -- in terms of fairness -- I'm
 20 trying to get the argument out. 
 21 MR. OLSON: I understand, Justice Breyer, I
 22 understand what you're saying. And there's a certain --
 23 there's a certain logic to it. But if that is -- if that
 24 was the case, then the Ninth Circuit's rule is under-
 25 inclusive because if the defendant really wants to know

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 what the best chances are, rather than the exculpatory
 2 material or the impeachment material, what he is going to
 3 want to know is the inculpatory material. And you made
 4 the point about the other -- other prosecutions that are
 5 being held over the defendant's head. He's going to want
 6 to know what -- well, what evidence do they have on the
 7 greater offense that they're about to charge me with,
 8 because I'm going to take my chances now and plead to this
 9 lesser included offense.
 10 So, if the Ninth Circuit wanted to accomplish
 11 what you're talking about as the thrust of your question,
 12 it would have gone -- and I suspect that it will --
 13 QUESTION: Well, you -- you wouldn't want it to
 14 go further, would -- would you, General Olson? You -- you
 15 would not want us to adopt a rule that encourages -- that
 16 enables innocent people to more intelligently plead guilty
 17 when they're innocent? 
 18 MR. OLSON: No. I'm not --
 19 QUESTION: I mean, it seems to me we should do
 20 everything to discourage people who are innocent from
 21 pleading guilty. 
 22 MR. OLSON: I -- I --
 23 QUESTION: What kind of a legal system is this
 24 where we're going to design our rules to encourage guilty
 25 people to plead -- or innocent people to plead guilty? 

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 It's crazy. 
 2 MR. OLSON: This Court -- this Court has said
 3 that it's perfectly appropriate in the adversarial system
 4 for the prosecutor to find legitimate ways to encourage
 5 guilty defendants to plead guilty. 
 6 Now, we -- you're absolutely right. It's --
 7 QUESTION: We're worrying here about innocent
 8 people, and we're trying to encourage them to plead guilty
 9 so that -- if they know everything about what the
 10 Government has. I mean, there's something wrong with a
 11 legal system that -- that --
 12 MR. OLSON: But there's --
 13 QUESTION: -- is even contemplating such --
 14 MR. OLSON: -- Justice Scalia --
 15 QUESTION: -- such action, it seems to me. 
 16 MR. OLSON: -- nothing in this case that
 17 involves that issue at all. We have a guilty defendant
 18 who has acknowledged under oath -- I think it was under
 19 oath. Usually it is, in the Federal court systems -- that
 20 this person was guilty. So, you are faced with the
 21 possibility of drafting a rule -- or the Ninth Circuit
 22 drafted a rule for a hypothetical situation not involving
 23 the case before it, which was over-inclusive because it
 24 includes the vast number of people that are indeed guilty,
 25 and under-inclusive because it doesn't provide a remedy --

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the best remedy which we would definitely not encourage,
 2 but I would suggest would be the next step, possibly from
 3 the same circuit, with respect to giving additional
 4 information.
 5 And it would be inconsistent not only with that,
 6 but it would be inconsistent with what this Court has said
 7 over and over again with respect to the value of competent
 8 counsel, the fact that certain chances have to be taken,
 9 that a defendant is not entitled to set aside a plea
 10 because he may have misconstrued the weight or balance of
 11 the prosecution's case, or there may have been mistakes of
 12 law. In one -- in -- in Brady v. the United States, in
 13 fact, it was a misconstruction of whether or not the
 14 defendant would -- could be -- could be put to death if
 15 the defendant went to trial. So, this Court has
 16 recognized that there are those balances in the system. 
 17 But what the -- what we urge upon the Court is
 18 that there are so many protections, including the
 19 discovery right, the fairly exhaustive --
 20 QUESTION: The discovery right would cover --
 21 you did say there were some things that a defendant
 22 perhaps would not know, and one of them you mentioned in
 23 your -- in your brief is if you rob a bank and you don't
 24 know whether it's FDIC insured. That kind of information. 
 25 How would that -- how would that come out pretrial?

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. OLSON: That would -- that would come out
 2 through rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal
 3 Procedure, which is set out in the appendix, I think 3a to
 4 5a, of our brief on the merits. The defendant is given
 5 pretrial considerable discovery rights to find out those
 6 sorts of things, and if the defendant is not sure and,
 7 after consultation with his counsel, wishes to go to
 8 trial, there's -- the Brady rights do kick in at an
 9 appropriate time to allow the defendant to prepare for
 10 trial. 
 11 What I'm saying is that -- that the combination
 12 of the constitutional rights to trial and -- and
 13 confrontation, the constitutional rights to counsel, the
 14 -- the statutory rights to discovery, the statutory
 15 obligations on a judge to make sure there's a factual
 16 basis for the guilty plea, the obligations -- and we have
 17 to assume under -- as this Court suggested in the
 18 Mezzanatto case, a -- a good faith behavior by our public
 19 officials that a prosecutor is not going to withhold
 20 evidence in -- on -- where it knows that the -- this is an
 21 innocent defendant. Those are ample assurances,
 22 especially in the context, as this Court has said over and
 23 over again, that the best person to know whether there's a
 24 factual basis for a plea of guilty is the defendant
 25 himself or herself. 

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 I will say one more thing that is -- that seems
 2 to me important with respect to the -- this -- the posture
 3 in which this case comes. If this Court were to determine
 4 that there is a constitutional right -- and we think that
 5 neither this Court's decisions nor the Constitution would
 6 lead the Court to that conclusion -- the constitutional
 7 right could be waived. The Ninth Circuit said that a
 8 defendant cannot, even if the defendant wanted to, plead
 9 guilty. Knowing that the defendant was guilty, the
 10 defendant could not waive the right. 
 11 Now, that has several implications. It -- it
 12 creates problems for the criminal justice system. The
 13 Brady -- the Brady right that the Ninth Circuit would
 14 engraft on the system here would force prosecutors to
 15 develop cases and use resources at the defendant's
 16 initiative, on the defendant's time table. It creates --
 17 turns Brady -- the right, from a fair trial right into a
 18 fair trial preparation right.
 19 With respect to certain types of cases, it would
 20 compromise conspiracy cases, racketeering cases, organized
 21 crime drug cases, white collar cases where there may be
 22 substantial warehouses full of documents. In other words,
 23 many prosecutors won't be preparing their case for
 24 determining what witnesses they're going to use until
 25 they're ready to go to trial. Once they -- if they had to

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 disclose this information on the defendant's time table,
 2 which the defendant -- if this rule were adopted by this
 3 Court, the first thing a defendant would do is offer --
 4 say, "I'm thinking about pleading guilty. Give me
 5 everything in your files." 
 6 Now, a prosecutor in complicated cases is not going
 7 to want to do that and -- and will refuse to engage in
 8 that process or will -- once -- once it does so, there's
 9 no more incentive for the -- for the prosecutor to enter
 10 into the plea bargaining process. So, it could be
 11 damaging to the benefits of the defendants over and over
 12 again that's received the benefits of the plea bargaining
 13 system, which this Court has sanctioned and encouraged. 
 14 QUESTION: I don't want to cut into your -- your
 15 reserve time. Just one question. If you prevail in this
 16 case, what happens? Does she get a longer supervised time
 17 of relief? Or is there anything that's still live in this
 18 case as to this defendant? 
 19 MR. OLSON: The --she -- she --
 20 QUESTION: Or has she served the full time
 21 anyway?
 22 MR. OLSON: -- she -- I don't -- I don't know
 23 whether she's served the entire -- the sentence that was
 24 given to her was 18 months in incarceration and a 3-month
 25 -- a 3-year --

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: 3 years. 
 2 MR. OLSON: -- probationary period. I think
 3 that that would continue to go on. That was at the very
 4 low range, low end of the guideline sentence. 
 5 QUESTION: So there is still some -- something
 6 at stake here?
 7 MR. OLSON: Yes, I believe so, Justice Kennedy,
 8 but I'm not sure, 100 percent sure, factually I know the
 9 answer to that. 
 10 If I may reserve the balance of my time.
 11 QUESTION: Very well, General Olson.
 12 Mr. Hubachek, we'll hear from you. 
 13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN F. HUBACHEK
 14 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 15 MR. HUBACHEK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 16 please the Court:
 17 The Due Process Clause requires the disclosure
 18 of materials --
 19 QUESTION: Before you get going, is the case
 20 moot? Is there something left on the 3-year probation
 21 period? 
 22 MR. HUBACHEK: Yes, there is, Justice O'Connor.
 23 QUESTION: Thank you. 
 24 MR. HUBACHEK: Now, the -- the disclosure of
 25 material exculpatory information is essential to ensure

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the accuracy of criminal convictions. And Ake indicates
 2 there's a societal and individual interest in the accuracy
 3 of such convictions that's paramount. 
 4 The system that we have now, as has been
 5 discussed already this morning funnels cases into plea
 6 negotiations, and the -- the Court has said that's not a
 7 bad thing, but it -- still, it funnels everybody, the
 8 guilty and the innocent, into the same sort of result. 
 9 Innocent people are provided the same substantial and
 10 legitimate incentives to plead guilty as guilty people
 11 are.
 12 And if I could return to Justice --
 13 QUESTION: No. I -- I object to that. I -- I
 14 don't think our system ever encourages or, indeed, even
 15 permits an innocent person to plead guilty. Our rules
 16 require the judge to -- to interrogate the person pleading
 17 guilty to make sure that, indeed, the person is guilty. 
 18 There is nothing in our system that encourages or even
 19 allows an innocent person to -- to plead guilty. And I
 20 would be horrified if -- if there were something like
 21 that.
 22 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, Justice Scalia, the -- the
 23 system does not -- first of all, I guess the first
 24 protection would be a rule 11 type factual basis. That's
 25 not required in every case. In fact, the Fifth Circuit

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 cases that the Solicitor General relies upon, both of
 2 those were nolo or Alford type pleas. So, there was no
 3 factual basis provided at all in those cases. Individuals
 4 who don't know whether they're innocent or guilty -- they
 5 don't have to provide a factual basis that's -- that's
 6 incorrect or false.
 7 QUESTION: How many individuals don't know
 8 whether they're innocent or guilty?
 9 MR. HUBACHEK: Your Honor, there are some. 
 10 I've --
 11 QUESTION: I'm sure there may be rare cases, but
 12 it -- it is rare. Is it not? 
 13 MR. HUBACHEK: I'm sure that it's not
 14 tremendously common, but the important thing is -- is that
 15 individuals who are innocent do receive the same
 16 incentives to plead guilty. And I've cited some cases
 17 from various State courts at pages 10 to 11 of the brief
 18 where individuals pled guilty where substantial material
 19 exculpatory evidence existed, several cases like Justice
 20 Stevens' hypothetical involving identification testimony
 21 where an individual was charged with an offense and was
 22 told that there had been an identification made by what
 23 appeared to be an otherwise unimpeachable witness --
 24 QUESTION: So -- so that's what your case comes
 25 down to? You want us to facilitate the pleading of guilty

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 by innocent people. You -- you want us to set up a system
 2 that will make -- will make that a more intelligent
 3 decision so that we can put in jail a lot of people who
 4 plead guilty even though they're innocent because it's a
 5 good deal for them.
 6 MR. HUBACHEK: No, Your Honor, not -- not at
 7 all. I --
 8 QUESTION: I thought that's what you're saying. 
 9 I don't know what other -- for the guilty person, you're
 10 not worried about it. You're -- you're asserting the
 11 rights of the innocent.
 12 MR. HUBACHEK: Right. It's the innocent person
 13 who needs to receive this --
 14 QUESTION: Who needs to be able to plead guilty
 15 so he'll -- he'll serve a sentence that he doesn't
 16 deserve.
 17 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, Your Honor, the fact that
 18 that happens exists already. The rule that I'm asking for
 19 is to provide material exculpatory information to
 20 individuals who are not guilty which will, when they are
 21 able to --
 22 QUESTION: But your client is guilty, and I
 23 don't understand why what we're talking about is some
 24 hypothetical. You have to establish your client's right
 25 and the argument is, if the case is going to go to trial,

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 you're entitled, before the trial starts, to get this
 2 stuff, but you're not entitled to get it in the beginning
 3 of the case. And you are representing a guilty client and
 4 asserting that right on behalf of your guilty client.
 5 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the --
 6 the posture of the case, as has been discussed, is that
 7 there -- this is a sentencing issue where there's a
 8 request for a departure based upon the -- this fast track
 9 program. Ms. Ruiz didn't participate in the fast track
 10 program because she objected to the term of the plea
 11 agreement which required her to surrender her rights under
 12 the -- the Brady decision. 
 13 QUESTION: But she -- she pled guilty
 14 nonetheless.
 15 QUESTION: She said she's guilty. 
 16 MR. HUBACHEK: Yes, she did. 
 17 QUESTION: And she didn't enter an Alford plea.
 18 MR. HUBACHEK: No, Justice Souter, she did not. 
 19 But the -- the way that the case was presented to the
 20 Ninth Circuit was that she had a constitutional right to
 21 this information, if it existed. I mean, there are
 22 situations where the -- the marijuana, for instance, in
 23 this case is concealed. It's unlikely that an individual
 24 who's merely a courier would ever have actual access to
 25 it. There is a recent spate of cases in Dallas where the

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 drugs that were seized turned out not to be drugs.
 2 QUESTION: That's all true, but this is --
 3 you're asking for a really major change in the system. I
 4 mean, what the Government says -- and maybe it would be a
 5 better system, but the Government says, once we go down
 6 this path, here's what's going to happen. And they sound
 7 right to me.
 8 The prosecutors, who are very busy -- very busy
 9 -- and have a little time with the witnesses and they go
 10 in and start talking about a plea, will now not be able to
 11 do that. They'll have to look into their witnesses, get
 12 all the evidence together, get the impeachment stuff, give
 13 it to the defendant, and 80 percent of them or maybe only
 14 30 percent will say, the hell with this. We'll go to
 15 trial. I'm not going to do it. We'll go to trial.
 16 And under the present system, particularly in
 17 drug offenses, what that means for many, many, many
 18 people, guilty and innocent -- let's say guilty -- they're
 19 going to go away for very long times. And therefore,
 20 we're transforming this system into something like a
 21 European system where you can't take guilty pleas, and
 22 it'd be somewhere in the middle. That's a major change. 
 23 And, anyway, the Constitution doesn't requirement --
 24 require it and it would work out the worse, they say, for
 25 a lot of defendants. 

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, first of all, Justice
 2 Breyer, the -- this system has been in place in the
 3 Southern District of California, which has this enormous
 4 caseload and all these drug cases, for the past year. The
 5 term --
 6 QUESTION: Have they been giving all the
 7 evidence, the impeachment evidence and so forth? 
 8 MR. HUBACHEK: Right. The term that -- that Ms.
 9 Ruiz objected to has been removed from the plea agreement. 
 10 It's been going on for a year. The pleas are proceeding
 11 apace. 
 12 QUESTION: The same way?
 13 MR. HUBACHEK: The same way, Your Honor. The --
 14 QUESTION: But let's -- let's go back perhaps to
 15 Justice Ginsburg's question, that you say you're here on
 16 behalf of innocent people who want to plead guilty. But
 17 your own client admitted that she was -- had 50 or 60
 18 pounds of marijuana. Surely, you've got to argue for a
 19 rule that favors something like that who is not an
 20 innocent person.
 21 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, the rule that I'm proposing
 22 would, indeed, benefit both non-innocent and innocent
 23 individuals. But that's the case with every
 24 constitutional protection.
 25 QUESTION: Well, wouldn't it be better to just

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 say we don't accept guilty pleas from innocent people? 
 2 That's our policy. 
 3 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, the -- I don't think that
 4 any judge or any prosecutor wants to accept guilty pleas
 5 from innocent people. 
 6 QUESTION: And indeed may not do so. That's the
 7 rule. You -- you won't accept a guilty plea from someone
 8 who's innocent.
 9 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, the protections that are in
 10 place don't fully account for innocence. For -- for
 11 example, even in a rule 11 decision -- in a rule 11 plea,
 12 if you ask someone, did you sell the drugs or did you, you
 13 know, shoot the person, that doesn't say anything about
 14 whether or not there's entrapment. It doesn't say
 15 anything at all about whether or not there's self-defense. 
 16 If a defendant pleads guilty in ignorance of that kind of
 17 information, then in fact an innocent person could plead
 18 guilty. In Alford pleas or nolo pleas, there's no factual
 19 basis provided at all. And again --
 20 QUESTION: Wait a minute. I don't understand. 
 21 The person doesn't understand that there's a -- this
 22 person doesn't have a lawyer who tells him, you know, if
 23 you shot the person in self-defense, of course, you're not
 24 guilty. Is -- is that the hypothetical you're positing,
 25 somebody who has such poor legal advice and he doesn't

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 know there's a right of self-defense?
 2 MR. HUBACHEK: The -- the concern here, Justice
 3 Scalia, is not evidence that the lawyer has access to and
 4 simply misadvises the client. I understand that you have
 5 to take the risk in many situations. What I'm talking
 6 about is evidence that would support such a defense, an
 7 entrapment defense, or a self-defense defense that's not
 8 available to counsel but is in the possession of -- of the
 9 prosecution.
 10 QUESTION: Well, it would certainly be in
 11 possession of the defendant. I mean, it -- it's
 12 impossible for him not to know whether he was acting in
 13 self-defense. The -- the only possible reason for -- for
 14 giving him, this innocent person, this information is to
 15 enable him to make an intelligent judgment to plead guilty
 16 even though he's innocent. And I don't think we're -- I
 17 don't think we're supposed to encourage that.
 18 I mean, we would have contradictory policies. 
 19 Other provisions of our laws make it very clear that we
 20 are not to accept guilty pleas from innocent people, and
 21 you want to adopt a system that will enable innocent
 22 people more intelligently to plead guilty.
 23 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, perhaps -- what I'm saying
 24 is -- is that if information that supports the self-
 25 defense theory that is not in the possession of the

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 defense but is in the possession of the prosecution, if
 2 that evidence is turned over, that will make it more
 3 likely that the innocent person will go to trial --
 4 QUESTION: Okay. Let's --
 5 QUESTION: Is there -- is there any precedent
 6 outside the Ninth Circuit that says Brady is an immediate
 7 turnover right and not a preparation for trial right?
 8 MR. HUBACHEK: Yes, there is. The Second
 9 Circuit has adopted this rule since 1988, and again, while
 10 the Solicitor General has come forward and indicated there
 11 are numerous potential down sides to this type of
 12 constitutional rule, the bottom line is -- is it --
 13 QUESTION: The Second Circuit has for impeaching
 14 material as well?
 15 MR. HUBACHEK: Yes, Your Honor. 
 16 QUESTION: Let me go back to a variant of
 17 Justice Scalia's question. It seems to me that your
 18 strongest argument is the argument that does focus on the
 19 -- the supposedly innocent defendant. And -- and the
 20 argument that I think is strongest with respect to that
 21 category is the argument that those who enter Alford pleas
 22 obviously are not doing so because they want to plead
 23 guilty, despite their protest of innocence, they're doing
 24 it because they think they face such terrible odds that,
 25 in fact, it's better for them to collapse at the beginning

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 and get it over with. And if these people are presented
 2 with exculpatory, including impeachment evidence, they are
 3 less likely to do just what Justice Scalia says we, after
 4 all, as a system don't want them to do.
 5 My question is, do you have any indication that
 6 there is such a rash of unintelligent Alford pleas going
 7 on that we should modify the entire system to respond to
 8 this risk of Alford pleas that, in fact, would not be
 9 entered if the disclosure that you ask for were given?
 10 MR. HUBACHEK: I don't have an -- an empirical
 11 study that shows how many such guilty pleas are entered. 
 12 I've cited on pages 10 to 11 of the respondent's brief a
 13 number of cases in which there are potentially innocent
 14 people who have pled guilty, individuals who didn't know,
 15 for instance, that a witness saw the tire blow out on the
 16 car before the car crossed over the median, indicating
 17 that that person -- that the tire blowout, not the
 18 person's driving was responsible for the accident.
 19 Another case, the Gibson case, where the
 20 prosecutor was actually told by the main identification
 21 witness that she was changing her story, and that wasn't
 22 turned over to the defense. 
 23 In the Lee case, a situation where the
 24 individual was charged with an offense and told that there
 25 was an identification, and it turns out that the -- the

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 witness misidentified him and that then the -- the witness
 2 was later shown, before a preliminary hearing, a picture
 3 of the defendant. So, there are cases out there in which
 4 this risk exists. 
 5 And if I could, I think that the -- one of the
 6 problems I guess in getting across the point is that I
 7 think the Solicitor General has misstated the import of
 8 the Ninth Circuit's test. The Ninth Circuit's test is not
 9 solely a -- you know, we want to give you all the cards so
 10 you can make a better strategic choice. The -- the test
 11 is derived from the Court's decision in Hill v. Lockhart,
 12 and Hill v. Lockhart's test says would the defendant have
 13 gone to trial if, in fact, he had received the proper
 14 advice. But then it says that --
 15 QUESTION: Well, but even -- even if you're
 16 going to imply -- if -- if that's going to be your
 17 standard, it seems to me that the Solicitor General has
 18 got a point when he says if the Ninth Circuit test is
 19 going to be applied and applied with your gloss, it can't
 20 stop where it is now. It's going to have to go the
 21 further step and, in effect, require disclosure of all the
 22 inculpatory evidence. What's your response to that?
 23 MR. HUBACHEK: My response to that is -- is that
 24 we're asking for a right based on Brady, and Brady doesn't
 25 provide for --

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Oh, but Brady -- I mean, Brady
 2 ultimately comes down to a judgment about materiality, and
 3 -- and materiality in the sense of -- of the kind of
 4 evidence that disturbs confidence in the verdict is a
 5 judgment that can only be made in the context of the
 6 entire evidence of the case. Brady judgments ultimately
 7 are made after the fact. And I don't see why that -- that
 8 very fact if we're -- if Brady is going, ultimately, to be
 9 our standard here, doesn't imply just what the Solicitor
 10 General argued.
 11 Before we can tell that there has been a
 12 violation of the rule that you propose, a court would have
 13 to know -- and indeed, before that, a defendant presumably
 14 would have to know -- the -- the entire evidentiary world
 15 of that case. And that means you've got to know a lot
 16 more than impeachment evidence or even exculpatory
 17 evidence. You've got to know what the inculpatory
 18 evidence is. So, it seems to me that what you're arguing
 19 for, even with your gloss and even starting with Brady, is
 20 essentially a global disclosure rule.
 21 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I'd respectfully disagree. 
 22 I think that the Hill v. Lockhart test, when specifically
 23 the Hill case was discussing when defense counsel fails to
 24 -- to find material exculpatory evidence, that the Ninth
 25 Circuit test would apply at that point, but that that test

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 will ultimately devolve into what effect this evidence
 2 would have at trial. So --
 3 QUESTION: Hill -- Hill was an ineffective
 4 assistance of counsel case, wasn't it? 
 5 MR. HUBACHEK: That's correct, Your Honor. 
 6 QUESTION: So, we're not talking about any
 7 obligation of the prosecutor in Hill.
 8 MR. HUBACHEK: No. I understand. But -- but
 9 Hill talked about ineffective assistance of counsel in the
 10 context of the failure to locate material exculpatory
 11 evidence, essentially the same facts that -- that could
 12 conceivably result in the withdrawal of the guilty plea.
 13 QUESTION: Yes, but the relationship between a
 14 defendant's attorney and the prosecutor on the other side
 15 are by no means the same.
 16 MR. HUBACHEK: I agree. And Brady certainly
 17 doesn't suggest that they're the same. Brady in trial
 18 requires that the prosecutor turn over the evidence but
 19 not to tell the defense lawyer how to use it. Well, we're
 20 positing that the same sort of obligation should exist at
 21 the pretrial stage. The prosecutor has to turn over the
 22 information but not go any further and provide advice as
 23 to how it should be used. 
 24 QUESTION: It's so odd that it comes to us in a
 25 case where there's no suggestion that we're dealing here

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 with an innocent defendant. We're -- we're told nothing
 2 about what's out there that would affect this case, are
 3 we?
 4 MR. HUBACHEK: I -- I understand that this is a
 5 case where there's a guilty plea and we're not making an
 6 argument that she -- that Ms. Ruiz should be permitted to
 7 withdraw her guilty plea. However, if the Court adopts a
 8 rule that the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit's
 9 approach is incorrect, then defendants will not receive
 10 exculpatory evidence before they plead guilty and
 11 situations such as arose in the various --
 12 QUESTION: Well, I -- I assume there is, as the
 13 Solicitor General suggests, some pretrial discovery right
 14 that a defense counsel has.
 15 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, there's some pretrial
 16 discovery right, but it's not extensive and oftentimes it
 17 doesn't cover the types of information that has led to
 18 potential miscarriages of justice, as I set out in the
 19 brief.
 20 QUESTION: And in fact, the -- the relevant
 21 discovery rule actually prohibits, as I read it, discovery
 22 of some material that you say this rule would cover.
 23 MR. HUBACHEK: Right. For instance, the --
 24 the --
 25 QUESTION: Statements of witnesses, for example.

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HUBACHEK: Exactly. Justice Stevens,
 2 your --
 3 QUESTION: Which is -- which is a troubling
 4 concept because one of the things we're sort of trying to
 5 do here is balance the system-wide benefit of an -- a fast
 6 track program, on the one hand, with the occasional case
 7 where there's a risk of injustice that -- that concerns
 8 you. And it's that very balance that, it would seem to
 9 me, must have motivated the draftsman of rule 16 and the
 10 enactment of the Jencks Act that have developed some
 11 rather elaborate rules as to just what rights you do have
 12 before you plead guilty, and you're, in effect, saying
 13 well, we should go beyond those as a matter of judicial
 14 craftsmanship.
 15 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, the rule that we're
 16 proposing would not supplant all of those rules. This is
 17 a narrow range --
 18 QUESTION: It would add to them, and that's it. 
 19 There's -- there's a limited right of discovery under the
 20 Federal rules, and you are urging an expansion of that
 21 right essentially.
 22 MR. HUBACHEK: It -- it would expand it. That's
 23 correct. However, it would expand it in only a narrow
 24 fashion because the information that we would -- that the
 25 defense would be entitled to would be limited by the

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 notion of materiality. Much of the debate in Agurs and
 2 Bagley was whether or not a more broad rule should be
 3 adopted, but ultimately the -- the Court settled on the
 4 materiality standard. 
 5 QUESTION: What we're doing is -- is you're
 6 asking us to open up the plea bargaining process and
 7 piecemeal to bring in a constitutional rule that would
 8 affect one aspect of it. Now, it's -- it's hard for me to
 9 accept that, at least without knowing more about what are
 10 the proposals around in the bar and elsewhere as to how
 11 that process should be regularized. Are there rules
 12 suggestions, rules change suggestions, statutory
 13 suggestions? Where does this constitutional rule coming
 14 in, in a sense, out of -- from somewhere suddenly affect
 15 this -- the whole process? Can I get a grasp of that by
 16 reading something? 
 17 MR. HUBACHEK: I -- I can't direct you, Justice
 18 Breyer, to any particular rule change proposals that are
 19 out there.
 20 Our argument is based upon the notion that
 21 everyone agrees that the defendant is entitled to -- to
 22 material exculpatory evidence at trial under the Fifth
 23 Amendment and also that the -- that the Sixth Amendment
 24 requires defense counsel to find material exculpatory
 25 evidence to use at trial. 

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Now, the -- the Sixth Amendment also requires
 2 counsel to locate material exculpatory evidence before the
 3 decision to make a plea is -- is made. And the reason
 4 that is is so that it will be a plea that's worthy of
 5 confidence. And that's -- ultimately the standard under
 6 Brady is -- is essentially the same as under Strickland. 
 7 We want a -- a proceeding that's reliable.
 8 Under the current state of the law, if defense
 9 counsel fails to find a piece of material exculpatory
 10 evidence, that guilty plea is then, therefore, going to be
 11 unreliable. But if the same piece of -- of material
 12 exculpatory evidence is unavailable to counsel, but in the
 13 possession of the prosecution, that conviction is
 14 considered to be reliable even if the defendant doesn't
 15 get the benefit of it.
 16 So, what we're proposing is -- is that there is
 17 a complementary action of -- of both the Fifth and Sixth
 18 Amendment rights pre plea and during the trial and that if
 19 there is going to be an overlap in the Fifth and Sixth
 20 Amendment rights it's got to be at -- where the interest
 21 that those rights protect is at its highest, and that is,
 22 protecting the innocent from pleading guilty.
 23 QUESTION: Under the fast track program, does
 24 the defendant have to waive rule 16 rights?
 25 MR. HUBACHEK: The -- under the fast track

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 program, the defendant can't file any motions at all, but
 2 the -- what happens is -- is that there is a pre-
 3 indictment offer that's made and the pre-indictment offer
 4 is usually accompanied by discovery in the form of -- in a
 5 case like Ms. Ruiz's, the reports of the initial
 6 inspectors and then the special agent who comes in and
 7 does the interrogation and does the -- sort of a summary
 8 of the other individuals' information. 
 9 QUESTION: So, those are available even under
 10 the fast track program. 
 11 MR. HUBACHEK: That's correct. That information
 12 is provided. 
 13 QUESTION: Suppose you're right on your
 14 constitutional argument. I'd just like you to spend 1
 15 minute addressing what I do not see how we get around the
 16 simple fact that you have a client and your client is
 17 saying that, as a matter of law, the judge had to depart. 
 18 And not only am I unaware of any law that says the judge
 19 has to depart, but in this case, I can't even find a
 20 provision that would allow him to depart.
 21 And -- and I -- they've said, oh, well, he was
 22 under a mistake of law. So, I've read the three sentences
 23 quoted for that proposition, and I certainly don't see any
 24 mistake of law there. He says, the court has read and
 25 considered the -- the documents, blah, blah, blah, and

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 I've decided this is -- the court feels that this is not a
 2 proper case for departure. So?
 3 And in another part of the record, he says -- he
 4 says, if you didn't sign an agreement, you have to live
 5 with the consequence.
 6 MR. HUBACHEK: I -- I agree, Justice Breyer,
 7 that there's no rule that you can say that a district
 8 court is compelled to depart in any case. The -- the
 9 district court judge, when asked to depart because Ms.
 10 Ruiz was being denied the fast track benefit because she
 11 refused to agree to what she thought was an
 12 unconstitutional provision -- the district court's only
 13 response was -- is that was acceptance and offer. The --
 14 and the interpretation of that is -- is the district
 15 thought it didn't have discretion to depart unless the
 16 Government was agreeing --
 17 QUESTION: That's really not what he said. I
 18 mean, he just said you're not going to get advantage of
 19 this because you didn't sign it. 
 20 QUESTION: He said it's just not proper. I
 21 mean, I wish he'd give us language that -- that would
 22 indicate that he thought he couldn't depart, even if he
 23 wanted to. He just said it's not, in his view, a proper
 24 case, but that's -- you know, that's fully consistent with
 25 his discretion. 

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HUBACHEK: The -- the district court's
 2 comment related to whether or not -- he said to counsel
 3 that there was offer and acceptance and -- and that's it. 
 4 And that --
 5 QUESTION: What's bothering me is this, that you
 6 could say, okay, let's just hold everything in abeyance,
 7 get to the issue. If we do that, why wouldn't this case
 8 stand for the proposition that courts of appeals have
 9 absolute authority to review every instance in which a
 10 trial judge refuses to depart? In which case there will
 11 be tens of thousands of such instances every year going
 12 right up to the court of appeals for review of the
 13 question whether he should have departed. Now, that's a
 14 major change in the law, I think. And how -- how could I
 15 avoid that change and yet get to the issue?
 16 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, the Solicitor General
 17 hasn't been framing the questions related solely to the
 18 discovery issues, the Brady issue and the waiver issue. 
 19 So, I don't think that the Court would be ruling on the
 20 propriety of the -- of the Ninth Circuit's analysis --
 21 QUESTION: Your -- your answer is an easy one,
 22 Mr. Hubachek. Our -- our opinions are very clear that in
 23 cases where we say nothing about jurisdiction, there is no
 24 holding on jurisdiction. 
 25 MR. HUBACHEK: That's -- that's what I was --

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 (Laughter.) 
 2 QUESTION: If we simply didn't -- if we -- if we
 3 simply didn't discuss the jurisdictional point, our -- our
 4 decision would stand for nothing. But it's not very
 5 responsible to do that where it's very clear where there's
 6 that there's no jurisdiction. That's -- that's the more
 7 serious obstacle.
 8 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, perhaps cert was -- was
 9 improvidently granted. I mean, the -- Mr. Solicitor
 10 General has come up and said that the -- the Government is
 11 not challenging the -- the Ninth Circuit's ruling.
 12 QUESTION: Did you argue in the Ninth Circuit
 13 that there was jurisdiction? 
 14 MR. HUBACHEK: Yes.
 15 QUESTION: Then I take it you certainly don't
 16 take a different position here. 
 17 MR. HUBACHEK: No, certainly not, Mr. Chief
 18 Justice.
 19 QUESTION: But our remedy would not be to
 20 dismiss the writ. Our remedy would be to vacate the
 21 judgment of the court of appeals if the court of appeals
 22 did not have jurisdiction. 
 23 QUESTION: You don't want that. 
 24 MR. HUBACHEK: No, I don't. 
 25 (Laughter.) 

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HUBACHEK: With respect to the -- the --
 2 with respect to the Fifth and Sixth Amendment claim that
 3 we've made, the Second Circuit has also found a different
 4 theory under which the -- the Court could find a Brady
 5 violation, and they've indicated that the failure to turn
 6 over Brady information is essentially otherwise
 7 impermissible conduct under the Brady v. United States
 8 case. So, Mr. Chief Justice brought up Brady v. United
 9 States, and I think that the Ninth Circuit's analogy to
 10 Hill v. Lockhart and the Miller v. Angliker impermissible
 11 conduct approach has both addressed the concern that
 12 United States v. Brady would preclude. 
 13 QUESTION: But -- but, you know, to say we'll
 14 just call it impermissible conduct because we want to get
 15 it done isn't very satisfactory. I mean, you have to say
 16 why it's impermissible.
 17 MR. HUBACHEK: Right. And our -- our point is
 18 -- is that it's impermissible because the Fifth and Sixth
 19 Amendments together protect the innocent from conviction. 
 20 When the Fifth Amendment right to receive the information
 21 -- excuse me. When the Sixth Amendment right to have
 22 counsel find this information attaches, then the Fifth
 23 Amendment right to have the Government turn it over should
 24 also attach because the same source of unreliability would
 25 be present if, in fact, the defendant were to make the

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 decision to plead guilty without receiving material
 2 exculpatory information. 
 3 QUESTION: But in order to make that argument,
 4 as I understand it, you have to make an unreliability
 5 argument divorced from a materiality argument. Do you
 6 agree?
 7 MR. HUBACHEK: No. No, I don't because there is
 8 a materiality requirement in Hill v. Lockhart. 
 9 QUESTION: How do we judge that materiality at
 10 -- I mean, in Hill and Lockhart, when -- when you're
 11 dealing with counsel, you can at least say, well, if -- if
 12 they had been aware -- regardless of how the case would
 13 have turned out, there's a way in which it makes sense to
 14 say that if they had been aware of this kind of evidence,
 15 they would have said we're going to trial. We're going to
 16 roll the dice.
 17 When you're dealing with -- with essentially a
 18 -- a Brady rule, you're not dealing with a will they roll
 19 the dice or will they not kind of question; you're dealing
 20 ultimately with the question of what was its effect on the
 21 -- the soundness of the verdict, the soundness of a
 22 result. And the only way you can make that judgment is to
 23 know everything that would be in the case. In a sense
 24 that's easy in a Brady situation because you're looking
 25 back. Here you can't look back.

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 So, it seems to me that you've either got to
 2 come up with an entirely new materiality or prejudice
 3 standard, and the -- and the effectiveness of counsel
 4 cases don't seem to me quite on point there. Or you've
 5 got to dispense with a materiality standard entirely and
 6 say anything that would have had any tendency to exculpate
 7 or to impeach in a way favorable to the defendant, if
 8 denied, supports in effect a -- a claim for relief, which
 9 is a nonmateriality standard. 
 10 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, Justice Souter, on page 16
 11 of our brief, we have a block quote from Hill v. Lockhart,
 12 and I really think that the test that was discussed in
 13 Hill v. Lockhart covers the -- the concerns that Your
 14 Honor is mentioning today. And ultimately Hill v.
 15 Lockhart concludes by saying that in -- in the case of
 16 counsel failing to discover material exculpatory
 17 information, which is essentially the same type of problem
 18 that we're talking about here, it says that ultimately the
 19 assessment will depend in large part on a prediction
 20 whether the evidence likely would have changed the outcome
 21 of a trial. 
 22 Now, I certainly agree that it will be a more
 23 difficult assessment to make without there actually having
 24 been a trial, but we're asking that Your Honors adopt a
 25 rule in which you would be -- the courts would undertake

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 exactly the same analysis that Hill v. Lockhart already
 2 requires in the context of defense counsel failing to find
 3 a piece of exculpatory information. And -- so, we're not
 4 at all asking that this analysis --
 5 QUESTION: But that is a different -- I mean, it
 6 necessarily is a different standard from the Brady
 7 standard of materiality which we have now. Is it not?
 8 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, the Brady standard for
 9 materiality, as was explained in Kyles, derives from
 10 Strickland. Hill v. Lockhart also derives its materiality
 11 standard from Strickland. So, I think it's --
 12 QUESTION: Well, let's go back to my question. 
 13 They -- they may have a common ancestry, but in fact they
 14 are not identical tests because they are applied in
 15 circumstances that are by definition very different. 
 16 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I -- I think that it's an
 17 easier application post trial, but it's still the same
 18 test that -- that's -- that we're being asked to apply in
 19 the plea situation because Hill v. Lockhart says, look, if
 20 counsel doesn't find the key piece of evidence and you
 21 plead guilty, then we're going to go back and look and
 22 see, well, what would have happened at a trial if you had
 23 that key piece of evidence. If there's a reasonable
 24 chance you would prevail at trial --
 25 QUESTION: And in -- and in order to do that

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 intelligently, we've got to know what the trial would have
 2 included, won't we? And that either means, number one,
 3 that the disclosure has got to go to, in effect, the
 4 inculpatory evidence, or it means at the minimum, number
 5 two, that the State has an opportunity to come in and say,
 6 we'll tell you what the inculpatory evidence would have
 7 been. This is what we would have put in, and judged in
 8 this context, it's not material.
 9 One way or the other, either -- either the
 10 necessary implication of your test or the -- the
 11 implication that the State would have a right to respond
 12 to it, it seems implies that in order to apply your rule
 13 before trial, a -- a court, reviewing one of your claims,
 14 would have to make a judgment about the -- the
 15 significance of the evidence in the context of -- of an
 16 entire trial, a whole evidentiary record that can be --
 17 that can -- can be anticipated.
 18 MR. HUBACHEK: And that's the same approach that
 19 Hill v. Lockhart requires. But a prosecutor in making the
 20 determination --
 21 QUESTION: Except in Hill it's easier because we
 22 know that trial decisions are -- are often made without
 23 knowing what the result would be. They are decisions to
 24 go ahead and have a shot at defending the case, and that's
 25 a different -- that's a different standard from Brady

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 materiality.
 2 MR. HUBACHEK: Hill is a plea case.
 3 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hubachek.
 4 General Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.
 5 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON
 6 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 7 MR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
 8 What the respondent is proposing and what the
 9 Ninth Circuit adopted is an unworkable and undesirable
 10 rule to solve a nonexistent problem. And it's illustrated
 11 by the facts of this case. The footnote or the -- the
 12 pages in the respondent's brief cite some cases in which
 13 theoretically it might be that some driver who crossed the
 14 line earlier might create a problem, but that is not this
 15 case. And there's no empirical evidence or any other
 16 evidence in the record that would show that there's a
 17 significant problem here. The --
 18 QUESTION: Mr. Olson, would you address again
 19 the jurisdictional problem here? I mean, if -- if in fact
 20 the district court judge had discretion about what
 21 sentence to impose and could have -- and did exercise that
 22 discretion, do we have to be concerned about --
 23 MR. OLSON: I think that is not an easy
 24 situation, but I think that the Ninth Circuit believed
 25 that however inartfully the district court expressed it or

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 incompletely the district court expressed it, that the --
 2 that the district court was saying it didn't feel that it
 3 had the capacity or the ability under the law to depart,
 4 that it didn't have the discretion to do so. That's what
 5 the Ninth Circuit decided. We argued otherwise to the
 6 Ninth Circuit --
 7 QUESTION: I guess this is not a proper case
 8 could mean that, I suppose. I wouldn't put it that way,
 9 but it could --
 10 MR. OLSON: It could mean that. That's how the
 11 Ninth Circuit -- Circuit perceived it.
 12 QUESTION: I'd even attempt not to say anything
 13 about it, so long as I was not certain that there was no
 14 jurisdiction. 
 15 MR. OLSON: We -- we believe that we -- after
 16 looking at it carefully, we've decided that the Ninth
 17 Circuit probably was right under the circumstances,
 18 although you could argue it the other way, and that this
 19 -- this is an issue that is presented clearly with respect
 20 to the -- the legal standard that's been adopted to the --
 21 by the Ninth Circuit and which is in play today. 
 22 The -- the respondent says, well, pleas are
 23 proceeding apace in California notwithstanding -- or in
 24 the Ninth Circuit, notwithstanding the decision in this
 25 case. There is no evidence in the record to suggest that

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 this hasn't created a problem, and in fact, I'm informed
 2 that there are cases that have not been brought and cases
 3 that have been dismissed because of a concern about
 4 complying with the rule in this case, because once that's
 5 done, those cases are -- are potentially over with. But
 6 the fact is there's no evidence either way. 
 7 Justice Breyer, you raised some questions about
 8 whether we would be constitutionalizing a rule which would
 9 change Jencks and change the discovery rules. There --
 10 there -- on page 26 of the Government's brief, we talked
 11 about the fact that there have been efforts to change and
 12 accelerate the discovery requirements and that those have
 13 been soundly rejected for the very reasons we've been
 14 talking about here. And the Jencks standard is what it is
 15 because there's very much concern over the safety of
 16 witnesses when those statements are produced earlier in
 17 the case. And that's -- Congress has made that decision
 18 quite consciously that those statements don't have to be
 19 produced until the witness is actually called in trial for
 20 that reason.
 21 Let me finish by saying that with respect to
 22 Hill v. Lockhart, that's a case involving a requirement
 23 that a defendant have, under the Sixth Amendment,
 24 competent counsel within the range of -- of competence
 25 expected for counsel in criminal cases. That's a Sixth

54
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. It is
 2 not a -- a constitutional right to effective assistance of
 3 the prosecution in deciding whether to plead guilty or
 4 not.
 5 What we have in this case is a rule which is not
 6 required, which -- which would cause considerable
 7 problems. It would undermine the plea bargaining system,
 8 which is important to the administration of criminal
 9 justice in this country, and affect the finality of guilty
 10 pleas, which is an important consideration as well.
 11 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, General
 12 Olson.
 13 The case is submitted.
