3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

4 next in Mohawk Industries v. Williams.

5 Mr. Phillips.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

9 and may it please the Court:

10 This case involves the somewhat murky concept

11 of an association-in-fact enterprise within the meaning

12 of section 1961(4) of title 18, which is the RICO

13 statute, and actually the specific language in this

14 case, which is reproduced in the Petitioner's brief at

15 page 2, is a group of individuals associated in fact.

16 In this case, there are two fairly obvious

17 enterprises that one might have expected a plaintiff to

18 identify in this -- in its -- in their complaint. The

19 first one is Mohawk Industries, which is their

20 employer. That is a corporation, clearly eligible to

21 serve as an enterprise. But, of course, the problem is

22 if you identify Mohawk as the -- as the enterprise, you

23 then cannot sue Mohawk as the person under this Court's

24 decision in Kushner. And so Mohawk was an unattractive

25 enterprise under -- on that -- because of that reason.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Second, there are the recruiting and

2 temporary agencies which are likely corporations and

3 certainly are legal entities and, again, are eligible

4 to be enterprises within the meaning of the statute.

5 But, again, here the problem is that there is no

6 indication that Mohawk in any way directs or conducts

7 the affairs of those agencies, and therefore, under

8 this Court's explicit holding in Reves, there would no

9 -- there would be no basis for liability.

10 And so the plaintiffs have attempted to sort

11 of move around those two substantial obstacles to

12 stating a claim by laying the claim to what is called

13 an association-in-fact enterprise. Their complaint at

14 paragraph 76, which is on page 23 of the joint

15 appendix, states this fairly broadly. Mohawk has

16 participated in an association-in-fact enterprise with

17 third party employment agencies and other recruiters.

18 The question is what is this enterprise and

19 does it have legs for purposes of bringing a RICO

20 action. In analyzing that question, it seems to me

21 there are two subissues within that.

22 The first one is whether or not the language

23 of section 1961(4) precludes using the corporation as

24 part of an association-in-fact enterprise because

25 1961(4) explicitly -- or specifically refers to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 individuals, and everyone has recognized, including I

2 think the Respondents and the United States, that if --

3 if it were clear that association-in-fact enterprises

4 or that enterprises limited to individuals under these

5 circumstances, given the structure of the statute, the

6 corporation would not be permissibly brought in on this

7 particular theory. So you have to get past whether or

8 not that is a limiting principle under this definition.

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we were --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Before you get to your

11 second point, why is that first point before us? You

12 -- you didn't raise it in the courts below. You didn't

13 raise it in your petition here. Your question

14 presented it -- I'd like to stretch to reach it, but I

15 don't even find it necessarily included within the

16 question presented. The question presented is whether

17 a defendant corporation and its agents engaged in

18 ordinary, arms-length dealings can constitute an

19 enterprise in light of the settled rule that a RICO

20 defendant must conduct or participate in the affairs of

21 some distinct enterprise and not just its own affairs.

22 It seems to me it's only question two you put before

23 us.

24 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia, the -- the

25 answer -- a couple answers.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 First of all, obviously, we could not have

2 raised this before the -- either the district court or

3 the court of appeals because the law was absolutely

4 settled in the Eleventh Circuit.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: As it is in nine other

6 circuits.

7 MR. PHILLIPS: As it is in nine other

8 circuits.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: And all circuits against

10 you.

11 MR. PHILLIPS: To be sure.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: And we would have been

13 unlikely to accept cert on -- on point one alone I

14 think.

15 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

16 But the second -- but the question is not --

17 the question is whether or not that issue is fairly

18 subsumed within the question that was actually

19 presented, and that --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think it's -- it's a

21 little more difficult in your case because you're

22 pursuing an interlocutory appeal, which you were

23 allowed to do only because you've got double

24 certification and you got certification on the

25 questions that the district court addressed. You can't

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 expand a 1292(b) order to include things that were not

2 decided below.

3 MR. PHILLIPS: The -- the question presented

4 in this case -- and it's the same question that was

5 presented below -- is whether the defendant corporation

6 and its agents under these circumstances can constitute

7 an enterprise.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: In light of the settled rule

9 that a defendant must conduct or participate in the

10 affairs of some distinct enterprise and not just its

11 own affairs.

12 MR. PHILLIPS: To be sure. But the --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you hadn't included that

14 last part, in light of, but it seems to me you're

15 focusing on the -- on the particular claim that you're

16 making.

17 MR. PHILLIPS: But, Justice Scalia, the in

18 light of certainly raises the secondary issue, but it's

19 still -- I mean, the rule is whether it's fairly

20 subsumed within the question. And it is a logically

21 prior question whether or not the statute extends to

22 this particular situation.

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is logically prior, and I

24 hate to go through all the trouble of figuring out this

25 case if, indeed, corporations are ineligible anyway. I

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 mean, you know, we're -- we're answering a totally

2 hypothetical, nonexistent question.

3 MR. PHILLIPS: But the situation that's

4 presented here is identical to the situation that

5 existed in McNally v. United States, Justice Scalia.

6 In that case, the question was whether or not an

7 intangible rights theory of mail fraud could be

8 extended to include nongovernment officials. That was

9 the specific question presented in that case, and

10 that's the -- the question the Court granted. And

11 every court of appeals had interpreted that statute to

12 say that intangible rights theories are valid under

13 that statute. And -- and that issue was not adverted

14 to in the petition, and it was briefed in this Court --

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And they weren't --

16 MR. PHILLIPS: -- and it was regarded as

17 fairly subsumed just as --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- they weren't --

19 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- they weren't -- your

21 problem is you don't have a final judgment. The only

22 way that you can get even to the court of appeals is on

23 that 1292(b) order. And I thought that the function of

24 1292(b) was to say specify the questions that are so

25 important that they have to be decided and appealed

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 before there's a final judgment. And whatever there

2 might have -- whatever one might read into a question

3 presented, I don't think that 1292(b) orders have ever

4 been treated that way.

5 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I don't have any specific

6 authority to the contrary, although the other side

7 didn't argue 1292(b) as in some sense a limitation

8 here. And I don't see anything in this Court's rules

9 which broadly authorize the Court to grant certiorari

10 to any question that's fairly subsumed within the

11 question presented. And it is a totally artificial

12 inquiry to sit here and say, you know, how are we going

13 to analyze what is --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we get through that.

15 I see the artificial part. Just what is it? Piling

16 Pelion on something or other. Mountains that you pile

17 one on top of the other.

18 But your opponents have cited in your brief

19 -- in the brief on page 12 that counsel for Mohawk said

20 to the court, specifically, Mohawk agrees that a

21 corporation can be both a RICO person and part of an

22 association-in-fact enterprise. Now, if we can

23 overcome all these other problems --

24 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: -- what do we do about that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 particular concession?

2 MR. PHILLIPS: The -- the clause that

3 introduces that is under current law, and that's

4 absolutely true in the Eleventh Circuit. Under current

5 law, as it existed in the Eleventh Circuit when we

6 wrote that, there was no question that a corporation

7 can be included within an association-in-fact

8 enterprise. Therefore, all we were doing was conceding

9 what the state of the law was in the Eleventh Circuit

10 and not questioning that, as -- as, candidly, we had no

11 ability to do that. It would have been an utterly

12 futile gesture to have raised this issue at any point

13 prior to.

14 We could have raised it in the petition for

15 certiorari, to be sure. We -- we think it is fairly

16 subsumed within the question presented, and we also

17 think it would be an -- an utterly artificial exercise

18 to try to analyze what is an association-in-fact

19 enterprise without first deciding whether or not a

20 corporation could be included in the first instance

21 because, as Justice Scalia says, if they can't, then it

22 seems to me this is a substantially easier question,

23 and also it is an extraordinarily important one.

24 It is true that the courts of appeals have

25 lined up consistently on the other side of this issue,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 but it is equally true that none of them has analyzed

2 this issue with anything near the kind of care that

3 would at least give me comfort that they've finally and

4 fully resolved the issue. And we're not going to get a

5 more thorough vetting of it at this point because the

6 circuits are -- are at this -- at this stage

7 essentially lined up. So the right time and

8 opportunity for the Court is here.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, unless somebody

10 raises it. Unless somebody raises it below to preserve

11 it for the rehearing en banc or -- or some other way.

12 MR. PHILLIPS: But all of those courts are

13 going to say the same thing, which is that this issue

14 has been resolved. It's possible, presumably, you

15 might get an en banc review on it, but again, you don't

16 have the question -- you don't have a split anywhere

17 other than some district court decisions that have --

18 that have recognized our interpretation.

19 The issue is squarely posed here at this

20 point. It's been fully briefed for this Court.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what -- what sense

22 would it make on the merits to get your interpretation

23 on the merits, which would mean, I guess, that five

24 individuals could be an enterprise because that's a

25 group of individuals.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, that's true.

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Five labor unions couldn't.

3 Five corporations couldn't. One individual and four

4 labor unions couldn't. One individual and four

5 corporations couldn't. One individual and three

6 partnerships couldn't. And -- but what -- what sense

7 would that make?

8 MR. PHILLIPS: Because all of those various

9 combinations can still be attacked under the theory of

10 RICO by just simply structuring your -- your enterprise

11 in the proper way. It is true you can't broaden it.

12 You can't expand the enterprise definition in order to

13 include a variety of different elements, but there's no

14 way -- I mean, in this case, for instance, they could

15 have named Mohawk as the enterprise. They could have

16 named the -- the recruiting agencies as the enterprise.

17 They could have named the corporate officers as the

18 enterprise, and they could have dealt with all of them

19 as a conspiracy. And all of those are ways to get at

20 precisely the issues that you identify, Justice Breyer.

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- if --

22 MR. PHILLIPS: And the answer --

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if Mohawk were a

24 partnership instead of a corporation --

25 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the partnership is an

2 association of individuals.

3 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, a partnership is

4 identified specifically under the statute as a -- as a

5 -- as an enterprise -- as eligible for an enterprise.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if the answer is yes,

7 if Mohawk had been a partnership, you would not have

8 this particular objection.

9 MR. PHILLIPS: That's correct. That wouldn't

10 be this particular --

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's only the corporate

12 form.

13 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. If we were a

14 partnership, it couldn't be in an enterprise with --

15 with an association of individuals. The question is --

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's --

17 MR. PHILLIPS: -- does -- can you have an

18 associational enterprise that extends beyond

19 individuals, that gets -- that goes beyond the gangs

20 and their family.

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's why I'm

22 asking you about the partnership because it is an

23 association of individuals. So I'm not clear on what

24 your answer is. No partnership could be treated just

25 like a corporation. They're not an individual? Or

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 partnerships are okay because there's not a separate

2 entity. It's a -- it's a association of individuals.

3 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, let me be clear on this,

4 that if -- if you just bring an action against the

5 partnership qua partnership you could clearly do that

6 because that's defined as a -- as a legal entity --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. Would the --

8 MR. PHILLIPS: -- for purposes -- if you're

9 trying to take the partnership and tag it to another

10 group of rag-tag individuals, that would not be an

11 enterprise in fact because that's not an -- an

12 association of individuals. It's a partnership which

13 has an entity apart from the individuals.

14 Now, if you disaggregated all of the

15 individuals within the partnership and called them

16 individuals and said that they group with another group

17 of individuals, then, yes. I think if you could

18 demonstrate that there is the loose organization,

19 common purpose, and all of the requirements for having

20 an association-in-fact available, sure, that wouldn't

21 be any problem.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: If this provision is

23 exclusive, as you claim it is -- it's intended to be an

24 exclusive definition, why -- why would they include

25 union, just union and individuals? What's magic about

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 a union that --

2 MR. PHILLIPS: Because --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that is not equally magic

4 about a partnership or a corporation?

5 MR. PHILLIPS: No. Well, because what they

6 have -- you have to go back to the original list. The

7 list starts off with individuals, corporations,

8 partnerships, associations, and other legal entities,

9 unions, which is in addition to that because it's not a

10 legal entity, or at least there was case law at the

11 time --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see.

13 MR. PHILLIPS: -- that it's not a legal

14 entity. And then other associations.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: This refers to a union that

16 is not -- is not an association.

17 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. This is just a union.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or any legal entity.

19 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: A union that is not --

21 MR. PHILLIPS: It's just an additional item

22 in the list.

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- not a legal entity. I

24 see.

25 JUSTICE ALITO: But why would they use

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 includes in that provision and means in other

2 provisions?

3 MR. PHILLIPS: Because I think they viewed

4 those as absolutely synonymous, Justice Alito, and --

5 and the reason I think that is because we know that in

6 some instances they use including but not limited to,

7 which reflects that Congress recognized that includes

8 in some contexts is an exhaustive listing, and I think

9 they thought in some contexts, meaning 1961(4), that it

10 was an exhaustive listing.

11 And also, it's important to look at the other

12 definitions of 1961(4), and I think this is the most

13 important element of the other side's submission in

14 this case because they do no business with any of the

15 other definitions. The Attorney General, the

16 definition of property for forfeiture purposes, those

17 are unquestionably exhaustive lists. At least, that's

18 the way I -- we argued it. They didn't respond to

19 that. And yet, those are introduced with the term

20 includes.

21 So it strikes me that the best contextual

22 evidence of what Congress intended here was that

23 includes would be used exhaustively and that the use of

24 individuals of associated in fact would be used as a

25 limiting principle, not as part of an exhaustive

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 principle that expands the scope of this beyond --

2 beyond -- into a realm where it becomes nothing but a

3 mere conspiracy statute, which is what it is today

4 under this -- under this particular theory.

5 That's -- unless there are further questions

6 about the straight statutory interpretation question,

7 then I would go to the second issue, which is assuming

8 that corporations can, nevertheless, be involved in

9 association-in-fact enterprises, does this state such a

10 thing.

11 And here, you have to go back to the Court's

12 opinion in Reves, and in Reves, what the Court held is

13 that liability depends on showing that the defendants

14 conducted or participated in the conduct of the

15 enterprise's affairs, not just their own affairs.

16 Okay? So it is an element of RICO liability that you

17 have to distinguish the -- the corporate defendant's

18 affairs in that case and -- and the affairs of the --

19 of the enterprise in this case.

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: And don't they do that by --

21 don't the allegations do that here by claiming that the

22 corporation was manufacturing or providing false Social

23 Security cards and was giving aid to the immigrants if

24 the -- the law got too close to them? I mean, that is

25 not merely the conduct by a corporation of the normal

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 business of hiring and employing people. Isn't that

2 the sort of extra that is alleged that takes this out

3 simply of the -- of the category of the -- of the

4 corporation conducting its own affairs?

5 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Souter, that is the

6 only allegation that comes remotely close to suggesting

7 anything along those lines, but I -- my submission to

8 you is that it doesn't get you there because what it

9 says is that the recruiters are sometimes assisted --

10 it does say the recruiters -- by Mohawk employees who

11 carry Social Security cards which they use for

12 prospective or existing employees' needs to assume a

13 new identity. That's when they come to Mohawk as

14 applicants or as employees, Mohawk provides them with

15 this identification. That's the allegation. That's

16 simply Mohawk conducting its own affairs. That's not

17 conducting or directing the affairs.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe I misunderstood

19 the thrust of the allegation. I thought the thrust of

20 the allegation was that Mohawk was acting illegally in

21 providing phony Social Security cards.

22 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't doubt that

23 there's a claim that -- that there's illegality. All

24 of this is permeated with claims of illegality.

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't -- doesn't that get

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 them at least to -- through the motion to dismiss, and

2 doesn't it at least get them to summary judgment?

3 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't think so because even

4 in Reves, the -- Ernst & Young had been found to have

5 engaged in illegality, that there was -- that there was

6 securities fraud involved there. So that's -- that

7 doesn't distinguish it. The fact of illegality would

8 make it a conspiracy, but it doesn't demonstrate either

9 what the -- what the association-in-fact enterprise is

10 and what are its affairs that are distinguished from

11 the affairs of the corporation.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: But in -- in Reves -- and if

13 -- and -- and you -- you may well correct me on this

14 because I'm -- I'm -- my memory is not precise. But I

15 thought in Reves, in effect, what they did was to lie

16 in the course of doing the sort of the thing that they

17 normally do. Here, the allegation is that they were

18 doing something, providing phony ID's, that employers

19 don't normally do. Isn't -- and, you know, maybe

20 that's a fine line, but is -- is it not a fine enough

21 line to get it out of Reves and get it beyond the

22 motion to dismiss?

23 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't think so, Justice

24 Souter, because -- because the -- it's a question I

25 think of abstraction. What we normally do is hire

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 employees and review their applications. Now, in that

2 process, we've been alleged to engage in illegal acts

3 by providing them with false identifications. But I

4 don't see how that's any different from the Reves

5 situation where the claim is that you're providing

6 ordinary auditing advice, but in the process you're

7 lying. You're engaged in illegal activities. It seems

8 to me it is precisely the same problem in both

9 situations.

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there is -- there is a

11 common element of illegality, but the distinction is

12 that in Reves, you're supposed to be providing these

13 services, making out statements, et cetera, and you put

14 the wrong numbers in them.

15 MR. PHILLIPS: Intentionally.

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Whereas in -- in this case,

17 an employer does not normally go about providing phony

18 ID's or any ID's for the people it hires. It says, who

19 are you? What's your Social Security number? And --

20 and there's -- there's an affirmative act here.

21 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Justice Souter, I

22 don't doubt that, but the question is what is the legal

23 standard in Reves. And Reves doesn't say, did you

24 engage in illegality, and Reves doesn't say, can we

25 make out a claim of conspiracy. Reves says what you

1 have to demonstrate is that you are conducting or

2 directing the operations or affairs of some entity,

3 apart from yourself. And here, all we're doing is

4 giving ID cards to our either actual or potential

5 employees.

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: In -- in -- yes, but you're

7 doing it in connection with a -- a joint recruitment

8 activity. In other words, the -- the agencies that you

9 hire to get the workers up to the door are not going to

10 succeed very well if -- if all the workers are going to

11 arrive without any papers and without any -- any

12 indication like a Social Security card and so on that

13 they can be part of -- of the legal work force. So

14 there's -- there's something extra being done both by

15 the -- the recruiters and by you, and the extra, in

16 effect, is a -- a scheme to provide phony ID's that

17 suggest that these people are -- are lawful rather than

18 -- than unlawful immigrants.

19 MR. PHILLIPS: But that still doesn't seem to

20 me, Justice Souter, to satisfy the Reves standard,

21 which is not just that there has to be something more

22 than conducting your own affairs immediately, although

23 that's important, and I don't think that -- I don't

24 think you can show that -- either that we went beyond

25 conducting our affairs or that the recruiters went

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 beyond conducting their affairs. All of these

2 allegations break out that way.

3 But what Reves says you have to do is

4 demonstrate that you conducted or directed the affairs

5 of whatever this association-in-fact entity is.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so that if you

7 charged --

8 MR. PHILLIPS: And that's the part that's

9 missing. I'm sorry.

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if you

11 charged the workers, you know, $10 for their fake ID

12 cards, you think that would be a different case.

13 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think either of

14 those --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because there, that's

16 -- there, you -- you -- there's a separate enterprise

17 basically selling ID cards, and that's not part of

18 Mohawk's business. But if you're just hiring them the

19 way you hire other employees, illegally as it's

20 alleged, that's Mohawk's enterprise if there's some

21 separate illegal activity?

22 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, see, under those

23 circumstances, I wouldn't have any problem calling

24 Mohawk the enterprise. I mean, that's the whole point

25 of this. The -- the logical enterprise here is the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 corporation. The question is do you go beyond that to

2 create these completely artificial entities. I mean,

3 you know, this -- this associational enterprise doesn't

4 exist except in the minds of the plaintiffs.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Phillips, I -- I tend to

6 agree with that, but I -- I just hate to get the lower

7 courts into this business of determining when a

8 corporation is going beyond its business. Your -- your

9 discussion with Justice Souter I think indicates how --

10 how hard that is, or some of the examples that the

11 Government brings up, such as a drug company that --

12 that sells drugs illegally, violating the drug laws.

13 Is that part of its business or not part of its

14 business? I -- I really don't -- don't want to buy

15 into that.

16 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think it's a little

17 late in the day, Justice Scalia, because that is

18 precisely the standard the Court articulated in Reves.

19 It said the question is not do you -- are you -- are

20 you conducting the affairs of your own operation,

21 however that's defined. But I'm not sure whether you

22 need to -- you need to define.

23 I mean, you know, in some ways, this also

24 goes to why it -- it's a mistake to get into this in

25 the first place because if you just said it has to be

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 individuals associated in fact, you don't have to get

2 into any of this inquiry. You could obviate the need

3 to evaluate all of these problems in one fell swoop.

4 But even assuming that you still want to live

5 in this world, you still -- it seems to me you've got

6 to identify what it is -- what -- what is the nature,

7 what is the loose organization of this separate

8 enterprise, and then what are its functions. And then

9 you have to evaluate how it is that the defendant is,

10 in fact, operating or conducting or directing the

11 affairs of that enterprise.

12 And that's what's missing, Justice Souter, in

13 -- in footnote -- or excuse me -- in paragraph 76

14 because while it goes to -- you know, it says we paid

15 for illegal aliens to be employed. Okay, well, that --

16 that's clearly hiring. That's the first one.

17 The second one is they have temp agencies and

18 they pool their employees and they loan them to us for

19 a fee. Well, that's the business of temp agencies.

20 That's what they do. They transport employees to -- so

21 they'll have them available in their pool. That's not

22 -- we don't direct any of that. We -- we are their --

23 we are -- it's an arms-length deal.

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but I still think

25 sooner or later we have to come back to something that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you and I went over a moment ago, and that is the --

2 one function, maybe the function, of -- of the -- of

3 the -- the entity claimed here is -- is providing cover

4 for the illegal status of the aliens. And it seems to

5 me that there is at least a bare claim here that Mohawk

6 is directing the affairs or the business of -- of this

7 third entity --

8 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- the --

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- by -- by the way that it

10 is -- allegedly provides phony Social Security cards.

11 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, according to the

12 allegation in paragraph 77, it just says obtaining

13 illegal workers. It doesn't say anything about

14 providing them with cover, that the common purpose of

15 this enterprise --

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Where -- where do we --

17 you're going to have to help me out then. Where --

18 where in the -- the pleadings or the -- the papers do

19 we get into the Social -- do we get the allegations of

20 the Social Security card?

21 MR. PHILLIPS: That's paragraph 76.

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

23 MR. PHILLIPS: And that's a factual

24 allegation. But -- but it -- but all I'm saying is --

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't that factual

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 allegation, as a bare matter, sufficient to satisfy the

2 objection that you raise, that something more than

3 merely the activity -- the conduct of -- of their

4 separate business is going on?

5 MR. PHILLIPS: No, because what you still

6 need -- there's still a higher -- it's not just the

7 higher threshold that it's got to be something that

8 moves beyond what the corporation does. It has to

9 involve the direction or the conduct of the operation

10 of a separate entity.

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if -- if, in fact, it

12 is the case that Mohawk is -- is providing the Social

13 Security cards, isn't it directing the means by which

14 the third -- the third entity is, in effect, illegally

15 -- or supplying illegal workers in -- in this -- this

16 joint enterprise?

17 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, obviously, we're going

18 to disagree about this I think, but at the end of the

19 day, I think the bottom line is what we're doing is

20 when the applicant shows up at our doorstep or when

21 they have, in fact, been hired, if for -- and this is

22 the allegation. Obviously, none of this is true. But

23 this is the allegation. That we then -- we then supply

24 those employees -- our employees and our applicants

25 with these false ID's. That's part of the process of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 our own hiring.

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is it reasonable -- is it

3 reasonable to suppose, on the basis reading the

4 allegations as they have to be read at this stage of

5 the proceeding -- is it reasonable to infer that --

6 from the allegation that there is an understanding

7 between Mohawk and the employment agencies that Mohawk

8 will provide this documentation and therefore make the

9 scheme work?

10 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it -- the allegation

11 certainly doesn't say that.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: It doesn't say that in any

13 -- any black letter statement.

14 MR. PHILLIPS: There is only one sentence in

15 the allegation that even remotely says anything about

16 this. And again, Justice Souter, the -- the fundamental

17 assumption here is that if there's something that goes

18 anywhere beyond our affairs, that that by itself is

19 sufficient to take you out of Reves. And what I would

20 argue strenuously is that what Reves says is you have

21 to be conducting or directing the operations of the

22 other entity's affairs. And providing this doesn't

23 conduct or direct anything. It may -- it may be a

24 conspiracy. It may satisfy some interrelationship, but

25 I don't see how it gets you to the point of an existing

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 enterprise.

2 If there are no further questions, I'd

3 reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chief Justice.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

5 Phillips.

6 Mr. Foster.

7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD W. FOSTER

8 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

9 MR. FOSTER: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chief

10 Justice, and may it please the Court:

11 As Mr. Phillips makes quite clear, Mohawk

12 does not like the way the plaintiffs have written their

13 complaint in this case. He would prefer -- they would

14 prefer that the enterprise be Mohawk Industries and

15 certain individuals within the corporation be named

16 as the RICO persons. But the plaintiffs write their

17 complaint and the plaintiffs are the master of their

18 complaint, and at this stage, as far as the case has

19 proceeded, which is only up to a motion to dismiss,

20 that's what we are to deal with, whether this states a

21 cause of action under RICO.

22 There seems to be no dispute in the lower

23 courts that corporations can form associations of fact

24 with other entities and that a corporation can be a

25 person conducting the affairs of such an entity. We

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 have alleged that here.

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There may be no

3 dispute about it, but it does seem kind of strange to

4 encompass them under the term individuals when the same

5 statute uses individuals and corporations separately.

6 MR. FOSTER: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. But

7 actually the term -- the definition of enterprise in

8 RICO starts with the word includes and it also states

9 any union or group of individuals associated in fact,

10 though not a legal entity.

11 The word union is not defined. According to

12 Mohawk, union should be interpreted to mean a labor

13 union, but that makes no sense structurally because the

14 first part of that definition includes legal entities,

15 and if reference were being made by Congress to a labor

16 union, then the union would have been inserted in that

17 part of it because at the time RICO was written in

18 1970, Congress had already enacted the Labor Management

19 Relations Act of 1946, which made labor unions suable

20 entities.

21 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, do you agree that

22 that's an exhaustive list in subsection (4)?

23 MR. FOSTER: I don't think it's an exhaustive

24 list, Justice Alito. It -- the Court has held in

25 previous cases that RICO used concepts and terms of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 breadth. This would appear to be that, as the Court

2 said in both H.J. v. Northwestern, Russello, and

3 Turkette.

4 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, would you agree that

5 includes is meant to be exhaustive in many of the other

6 -- in a number of the other subsections of this

7 definitional provision?

8 MR. FOSTER: I -- I don't think so. I

9 believe that the way includes is actually used, for

10 example, in the definition of Attorney General, opens a

11 long definition which is itself exhaustive, but leaves

12 room for change. Attorney General was written in a way

13 that allowed any official to be designated by the

14 Attorney General to fall within that description.

15 There's room for designations and there's room for

16 change in the Justice Department as it occurs over

17 time.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see how your point

19 regarding union helps you any because if -- if you --

20 if you win the point that union doesn't mean a labor

21 union, you still have, as -- as the end of this

22 definition, any union or group of individuals.

23 MR. FOSTER: Yes.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: A union of individuals or a

25 group of individuals. You're still stuck with

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 individuals.

2 MR. FOSTER: Well, I think union is -- it

3 says union or group of individuals. I think union is

4 something --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Either union means labor

6 union or it means a union or group of individuals.

7 MR. FOSTER: I would -- Justice Scalia, I

8 don't believe that union means labor union because --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

10 MR. FOSTER: -- if it meant a labor union

11 there --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'll give you that. Then --

13 then it means a union or group of individuals.

14 MR. FOSTER: A union or group of individuals.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. So, you know, you're

16 just as bad off.

17 MR. FOSTER: Well, the word individual is not

18 defined in the statute either, and --

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's not

20 defined in the statute, but the prior list in the same

21 sentence says individual, partnership, corporation. So

22 you'd assume whatever an individual is it's different

23 than a corporation or they wouldn't have had to say

24 corporation again.

25 MR. FOSTER: The enterprise alleged here, Mr.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Chief Justice, is actually not a single corporation.

2 That first list would not encompass a group of

3 corporations. A group of corporations is actually not

4 a single legal entity. It's a group of legal entities

5 that have combined to commit a pattern of racketeering

6 activity. It doesn't neatly fit into the first

7 definition, which seems to encompass only single

8 entities.

9 And so every single circuit court in the --

10 in the country to examine this question has held that

11 Congress didn't expect, anticipate, or intend to

12 exclude groups of legal entities from being -- being a

13 -- a RICO enterprise. They were captured by the second

14 part of the definition.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: There is --

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Still, it -- it -- you

17 know, we usually talk about person can mean a

18 corporation. This says individual. A person is

19 defined in -- in sub (3) just above it. A person

20 includes any individual or entity. Then the next thing

21 says individual. So it's not a -- it doesn't sound

22 like a corporation.

23 MR. FOSTER: Well, the use of the word union

24 or group of individuals seems to broaden it. The word

25 includes at the beginning of the definitional section

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 broadens it even further. As this Court held in

2 footnote 14 of the -- in the Sedima decision, the use

3 of the word requires in that definitional section was

4 key to understanding what it meant, and it said

5 requires, in terms of pattern, meant more than simply

6 two predicate acts. The word requires had to mean

7 more, and it had to be read in context. We think that

8 this should be read in context.

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your position

10 was it shouldn't be read at all because --

11 MR. FOSTER: Yes.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- this -- this Court is a

13 court of review, and to take a question that was never

14 certified, even to the court of appeals, to have this

15 Court address it seems to me very strange. It seems to

16 me to erode rather starkly the final judgment rule,

17 which we don't have here.

18 MR. FOSTER: Well, I agree with that, Justice

19 Ginsburg. I don't think the Court should entertain the

20 question at all. And --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what we're reviewing

22 is a ruling, not a question. You certify a ruling.

23 Now, it's usually set out for the court of appeals so

24 they know what the question is.

25 MR. FOSTER: We are reviewing a ruling --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What you're reviewing here

2 is a ruling.

3 MR. FOSTER: It's a ruling. We're not

4 reviewing a final judgment. All it is is a ruling. It

5 came to this Court and the question that this Court

6 accepted for certiorari has actually been -- all but

7 abandoned.

8 Mr. Phillips hardly used the word agent at

9 all, if at all. He doesn't argue why his rule about

10 distinctness should be applied here. There is no

11 allegation or he doesn't make any legal argument that

12 the members of this association-in-fact enterprise

13 should be deemed to be agents of Mohawk. That's not

14 alleged in the complaint. That's not the way the

15 complaint was written. They're all alleged to be

16 separate legal entities. They're -- for the motion to

17 dismiss stage, that is enough to satisfy this Court's

18 requirement in Cedric Kushner that the members of an

19 enterprise be distinct from --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is there

21 different about your proceeding to treat this as a RICO

22 enterprise that isn't covered by normal corporate

23 criminal conspiracy law? What does RICO add here?

24 MR. FOSTER: RICO does add more. It can't be

25 a mere criminal conspiracy to commit a single crime.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 There needs to be an association of entities that

2 associate over a considerable period of time to meet

3 either closed-ended continuity or open-ended and commit

4 a pattern of criminal acts that are related to each

5 other, that go on for --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they hire more

7 than one person.

8 MR. FOSTER: They hired -- and the

9 association itself, Mr. Chief Justice, would have to

10 exist over a -- a significant period of time. There

11 would have to be -- there's this durational element --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that different

13 than a normal contractual relationship that a

14 corporation is going to have with any number of

15 suppliers, vendors, agents?

16 MR. FOSTER: Yes. Normal contractual

17 relationship is not to commit a felony, and if --

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but I'm trying to

19 see what RICO adds to the normal conspiracy law --

20 MR. FOSTER: Yes.

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that would

22 otherwise be applicable. So we're assuming that the

23 arrangement is there and that they're engaging in

24 illegal activity.

25 MR. FOSTER: All right. And then we have the pattern

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and the durational aspect of it. And it has to affect

2 interstate commerce -- the enterprise does -- and in

3 order to have a civil cause of action --

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Congress didn't

5 -- to be fair, Congress did not enact RICO because it

6 was concerned that criminal conspiracy law, applied to

7 corporations, didn't adequately touch interstate

8 commerce. The whole point is that they had something

9 significantly different in mind, and your allegations

10 in the complaint seem to be fully met by application of

11 criminal conspiracy law.

12 MR. FOSTER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, a RICO

13 enterprise among -- is a conspiracy to commit crime,

14 but it's conspiracy plus. The plus is --

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't -- isn't the plus

16 simply more than one act?

17 MR. FOSTER: The plus is more than one act.

18 There has to be a pattern.

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so -- no, but I mean

20 literally. As -- as long as -- as two illegal workers

21 are going to be hired, isn't that sufficient to convert

22 -- to go from conspiracy to -- to RICO on your

23 analysis?

24 MR. FOSTER: There would have to be at least

25 two, and there would -- it would have to go on to meet

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the Court's pattern requirement. Two generally is held

2 not to be enough if it's a closed period of time that's

3 over. But this complaint alleges an open period, and

4 two would be enough, coupled with the allegation that

5 this is the normal way for the company to conduct its

6 business.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm trying to give

8 you a chance to explain why this looks like RICO rather

9 than just criminal conspiracy. And you've come up

10 you said interstate commerce. There's got to be more

11 than one. Well, none of that really suggests a

12 distinction. What -- what is it that makes this a RICO

13 case rather than just a criminal conspiracy case?

14 MR. FOSTER: It's because we have a joint

15 venture of entities operating over a long period of

16 time that have victimized a large number of people, and

17 there's a pattern of racketeering activity. And --

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's a pattern

19 because they hired more than one.

20 MR. FOSTER: They hired more than one. In

21 fact, the statute requires 10 in a 12-month period.

22 So there would actually have to be 10 for at least 2

23 years. So that would mean at least 20 illegal aliens

24 have to have been hired under the 1324 section that's

25 alleged in this complaint. And probably for more than

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 2 years or an ongoing pattern of racketeering activity,

2 and a person has to have been proximately harmed by a

3 predicate act in order to assert a civil cause of

4 action. Beyond that, there is the -- of course, the

5 requirement of Reves that the person -- and here the

6 corporation is participating in the affairs or

7 conducting the affairs of an enterprise. And --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but Reves demonstrates

9 that -- that your statement earlier that since it was

10 fraudulent action, it couldn't have been the business

11 of the corporation is simply false. We -- we haven't

12 held that whenever a corporation violates the law, it

13 goes beyond its business, although in a sense it does.

14 In Reves, we -- we said it didn't.

15 MR. FOSTER: Here, Justice Scalia, there is,

16 as was pointed out earlier in the dialogue with Justice

17 Souter, a very close cooperation among Mohawk and these

18 third parties to get workers, to bring them from --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but

20 that's -- we have to get into that is my point. We

21 can't just say since providing them with -- with phony

22 ID's is unlawful, it can't be the business of the

23 corporation.

24 MR. FOSTER: Yes, I agree. And I would

25 contend that there is enough factual detail and a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 description of the claim asserted in this complaint to

2 satisfy rule 8 to state a claim.

3 And the type of factual inquiry that Mohawk

4 has suggested, that Mr. Phillips has suggested, saying,

5 for example, their test that Mohawk cannot be

6 participating in the affairs of an enterprise that

7 involves hiring because it itself involves hiring would

8 dramatically change the interpretation of RICO. It

9 would mean that, for example, a drug dealer could not

10 participate in a drug enterprise because he does what

11 the enterprise does.

12 Since all corporations are engaged in hiring

13 activities, therefore, then no corporation or other

14 business entity could ever be prosecuted or sued under

15 RICO because that -- there is overlap between what they

16 do and what an enterprise does, the -- if the

17 enterprise is devoted to recruiting illegal workers for

18 a business. That just can't be what Congress had in

19 mind, and it's not consistent with what this Court held

20 in Turkette that a common purpose is required for there

21 to be a RICO enterprise.

22 In conclusion, I do not believe that the

23 Court should address Mohawk's first point. I thought

24 it was startling to return to that issue, that Mr.

25 Phillips stated the reason that it was not raised below

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 was because he knew that they would lose and the Eleventh

2 Circuit would rule against them. But, nevertheless, he

3 wishes it to be addressed by this Court and simply

4 bypass the court of appeal in the Eleventh Circuit. If

5 there's no split below, then the question would not

6 have been accepted for cert presumably, as has been

7 pointed out, and it should not be entertained now.

8 For the reasons stated, I believe that the

9 judgment of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals

10 should be affirmed. Thank you.

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

12 And Mr. Stewart.

13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

14 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

15 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

16 MR. STEWART: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

17 and may it please the Court:

18 Respondents' complaint alleges that

19 Petitioner has entered into a long-term, collaborative

20 venture with outside recruiters in order to perpetrate

21 hundreds, if not thousands of violations of Federal

22 immigration law. That sort of concerted, ongoing

23 racketeering activity alleged in the complaint is

24 encompassed by the text of 18 U.S.C. 1962(c) and it

25 directly implicates section 1962(c)'s core purpose.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 The judgment of the court of appeals should be

2 affirmed.

3 Now, with respect to the textual question,

4 our argument is not that the collaborative venture

5 alleged in this complaint falls within the terms of

6 section 1961(4). Our argument is that it falls within

7 the usual background understanding of the term

8 enterprise and that it's not excluded from the statute

9 by operation of 1961(4).

10 To take the first point first, if Congress

11 had not defined the term enterprise at all, but had

12 used the term enterprise in section 1962(c), this --

13 the courts construing the provision would have had to

14 determine whether the term enterprise was naturally

15 encompassed -- was naturally construed to encompass not

16 simply discrete legal entities but collaborations between

17 discrete actors. And I think it's pretty clear that

18 the term would have been construed to include such

19 ventures.

20 That is, the -- RICO was enacted against the

21 backdrop of the Travel Act which prevented the use of

22 business enterprises to perpetrate particular crimes

23 and it was well established that a business enterprise

24 meant not simply a corporation or similar discrete

25 legal entity --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE ALITO: Why shouldn't includes here

2 be read to mean means when that seems to be the way

3 it's used in other subsections of this provision and

4 when the only thing that seems to be -- if this is not

5 an exhaustive list, the only thing that seems possibly

6 to be omitted from the list is what's involved here,

7 which is a group consisting of a corporation or other

8 legal -- other legal entity and -- and natural persons.

9 MR. STEWART: I think there are several

10 reasons.

11 First, this Court's decisions make clear that

12 while includes may be construed as exclusive, if it

13 appears alone, when Congress employs the means/includes

14 structures -- structure and introduces some definitions

15 with the word means and others with the word includes,

16 that choice of verb should be taken as advertent, and

17 the Court shouldn't likely conclude that Congress

18 simply used the terms as interchangeable.

19 Second --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do any of those cases

21 that you allude to that have means in some sections,

22 includes in others -- do any of them have in third

23 sections, includes, comma, without limitation, comma?

24 MR. STEWART: No, but the -- the includes --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think that's a big

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 difference.

2 MR. STEWART: I think it would be a big

3 difference if the phrase, including but not limited to,

4 appeared in another provision of 1961, but that's not

5 where the phrase appears. The phrase appears in, I

6 believe it's, 1964(c) which deals with the -- the civil

7 remedies provision, and where --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Close enough.

9 MR. STEWART: -- where the word includes

10 stood alone within that section, it was natural for

11 Congress to use what we call a -- a belt and suspenders

12 approach, making it clear that the word includes

13 shouldn't be taken as exclusive.

14 The second point I'd make is that the last of

15 -- I believe it's the last provision of 1961(4) is the

16 definition of pattern of racketeering activity. And

17 that definition is introduced by the word requires.

18 The term pattern of racketeering activity requires at

19 least two racketeering acts committed not more than 10

20 years apart. And this Court in Sedima and then in H.J.,

21 Incorporated has attached significance to that choice

22 of verbs and has explained that Congress' use of the

23 word requires, rather than the verb means, implies that

24 two are necessary but not necessarily sufficient. So

25 when we're construing a provision in which the Court

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 has already recognized that, at least in some

2 instances, Congress' use of varying verbs to introduce

3 the different subsections will be taken as significant

4 --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but if we're trying to

6 think of what they were getting at, it's possible that

7 Congress was worried about organized crime taking over

8 the pizza parlor or taking over a trades union or

9 taking over a similar kind of enterprise. So that's

10 what they're thinking about.

11 Now, if we're thinking about that, they put

12 in the word groups of individuals because they

13 understand that organized crime could take over a group

14 of individuals. Now, once you do that, you RICO-ize

15 vast amounts of conspiracy law.

16 MR. STEWART: Well, I don't think --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: But -- but they had no

18 reason whatsoever for doing the same thing for what we

19 have are associations of trade unions with each other

20 or associations of -- of corporations with each other.

21 And to do that, adding that in when it doesn't say

22 that, would RICO-ize, with its treble damages and

23 private plaintiffs and everything, vast amounts of

24 ordinary commercial activity, not ordinary only in

25 that, but importantly, a certain amount of criminal

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 activity like passing bad checks or fraudulent behavior

2 is involved. But Congress wouldn't have wanted to --

3 that has not to do with organized crime. That does not

4 have to do with taking over legitimate enterprises.

5 So read this, I think he's saying, to mean

6 what it says most naturally. They're worried about

7 groups of individuals. They're not worried about

8 groups of corporations or groups of trade unions

9 interacting with each other.

10 And I'm trying to put the argument the other

11 way, and I wanted see what you respond.

12 MR. STEWART: I mean, in terms of speculation

13 about Congress's motive, I think you're very likely

14 right that the reason Congress added a specific

15 reference to groups of individuals was that they were

16 thinking in terms of mob families or syndicates,

17 criminal gangs that had no discrete status as a legal

18 entity. They're not incorporated, but they function as

19 unit. And they had those in mind, and they intended --

20 they wanted to make sure those were covered even though

21 they were not discrete legal entities.

22 And I think you're likely right that the

23 reason they didn't specifically include groups of

24 corporations is that they didn't have them in mind as

25 likely sources of trouble at the time. But that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 doesn't answer the question whether they intended to

2 exclude the coverage of those alliances if they would

3 otherwise be encompassed by the normal meaning of the

4 term enterprise. And if it came to cause the --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: You're -- you're willing to

6 go this far with them. You say take those words,

7 groups of individuals, and throw them away. And you're

8 saying after we throw them away, they're still covered,

9 and the reason that they're still covered is even

10 though the word enterprise includes any individual,

11 partnership, corporation, the word enterprise also

12 includes groups of legal entities, groups of trades

13 unions, groups of associations, even without that word

14 group of individuals.

15 MR. STEWART: Exactly. If -- if the term

16 enterprise appeared in 1962(c) but were an undefined

17 term --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, is there

19 any indication in the legislative history or anywhere

20 else in the statute that this meaning of the word

21 enterprise is what is intended, that is, that this

22 meaning of the word enterprise went beyond what it says

23 here, excluding group of individuals?

24 MR. STEWART: There -- there is in the

25 legislative history. That is, the legislative history

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 describes the coverage of the term enterprise as

2 encompassing any associative group.

3 Now, we don't contend from that stray

4 reference that Congress specifically had in mind

5 alliances between corporations and specifically

6 intended to include them. What we do contend is that

7 that legislative history is inconsistent with the

8 hypothesis that Congress anticipated the problem of

9 alliances of corporations and carefully --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stewart, this -- this

11 thing is at least -- at least -- ambiguous. Why

12 shouldn't we apply the rule that we normally apply with

13 regard to criminal statutes that where there is an

14 ambiguity, the rule of lenity applies and we shouldn't

15 give the -- the Government license to -- to ride closer

16 herd than -- than is clear in the statute? Why isn't

17 -- why isn't that an easy way to --

18 MR. STEWART: First, I --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- resolve this question?

20 MR. STEWART: -- I don't think that at the

21 end of the day, after all the tools of statutory

22 construction are applied, there is a genuine and

23 certainly not a grievous ambiguity. That is, there --

24 there are two potential sources of ambiguity. One

25 could simply be there's uncertainty about whether the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 word enterprise, taken alone, would typically be

2 construed -- nobody is contending --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's irrelevant because

4 it's not taken alone. It is defined. So the only --

5 the only question is what this -- what this definition

6 means. Is it exclusive or not exclusive? That's

7 really the only issue.

8 MR. STEWART: The -- the only question is

9 whether this list should be taken to exclude things

10 that are not on the list even though they would

11 otherwise be encompassed by the normal meaning of the

12 word enterprise. And this Court in many decisions has

13 given Congress a template. It said if you use the

14 means/includes dichotomy, we will take that choice to

15 be advertent and we will assume that when you use means

16 that's intended to be exclusive; when you use includes,

17 that's intended to be not exclusive.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even -- even when it's

19 absolutely clear and -- and as pointed out by -- by

20 your friend, you -- you did not refute the point that

21 in other sections where it says includes, it is

22 unquestionable that it is exclusive.

23 MR. STEWART: That -- that was part of

24 Justice Alito's question, and I think there are two

25 different senses in which a statutory list could be

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 considered exclusive or comprehensive. That is, one

2 would be legal exclusivity. For instance, the

3 definition of racketeering activity says racketeering

4 activity means acts indictable under the following

5 statutes. That definition is legally exclusive in the

6 sense that if -- if Congress enacted a new statute and

7 it prohibited conduct that was classic mob activity,

8 but it wasn't on the list of RICO predicates, we would

9 say that's out, it's not racketeering within the

10 meaning of the statute even though it would be

11 racketeering activity within a common understanding.

12 I think with the definition of Attorney

13 General, what we have is a different sort of

14 comprehensiveness. That is, it may well be that the

15 definition of Attorney General is comprehensive in the

16 sense of actually listing all the people who could

17 otherwise plausibly be regarded as standing in the

18 shoes of the Attorney General. It may be that

19 Congress, when it promulgated the list, got everything

20 that would have been covered anyway. It's not legally

21 comprehensive or legally exclusive in the sense of

22 directing courts that even an official who would

23 otherwise be regarded as an appropriate surrogate for

24 the Attorney General is not to be so regarded if he's

25 off -- off the list.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, a State attorney -- a

2 State attorney general wouldn't fall within subsection

3 10. Would -- would that be the case?

4 MR. STEWART: I -- I agree with that, but I

5 don't think that in the context of a Federal statute

6 referring to the Attorney General, a State attorney

7 general would typically be encompassed within the

8 meaning of that provision even if the provision were

9 undefined, whereas I think because executive power is

10 -- is generally deemed to be delegable, subordinate

11 officials standing in the shoes of a cabinet officer

12 would usually be thought to be encompassed by the

13 reference to the cabinet officer alone.

14 The other thing we would say, of course, on

15 the -- the statutory point is that there have -- there

16 has been a unanimous pattern of court of appeals

17 decisions in this area. Congress has not acted to

18 contract the definition of enterprise, but instead has

19 added new predicate acts.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the best court of

21 appeals opinion, the most thoroughly considered? I

22 haven't read any of them. Tell me -- tell me the best

23 one. I'd like to read it.

24 MR. STEWART: I've looked at them and -- I

25 would agree with Mr. Phillips that the analysis doesn't

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 tend to be lengthy, but I think Feldman would be one.

2 By and large, the -- the courts adopt the -- the

3 reasoning that we've adopted here, namely that because

4 the word includes signals an intent to be nonexhaustive

5 or to admit of other things being covered even if

6 they're not on the list, then they should be covered.

7 The --

8 JUSTICE BREYER: Are there any dissents in

9 any of those cases?

10 MR. STEWART: I don't recall any dissents at

11 least on the point. I -- I don't want to represent

12 that there have never been any. I don't recall any

13 dissents at least on the -- the pure question of

14 whether an association in fact comprised in part of

15 artificial legal entities can ever be covered.

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do any of the court of

17 appeals opinions deal specifically with the peculiarity

18 of this definition in which, although it starts out

19 with the word includes, then follows a -- a listing, A,

20 B, C, and D, and then it repeats one, but only one, of

21 the items on the list and says groups of these items,

22 i.e., individuals, are included? That's the

23 peculiarity of the definition. Do any of the courts of

24 appeals come to grips with that?

25 MR. STEWART: I don't know of any court of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 appeals opinion that really focus on that -- focuses on

2 that aspect of the question.

3 But -- but, again, we can accept kind of the

4 factual premises about what led Congress to draft the

5 legislation as it did, namely that it anticipated the

6 problem of groups of individuals banding together to

7 commit criminal acts and didn't anticipate the problem

8 of groups of corporations banding together for like

9 purposes.

10 But I think the whole point of having a

11 template, having an established rule that means and

12 includes, when they're used in the same statutory

13 provision will be taken as meaning different things, as

14 to give Congress a clue that if you've tried to list

15 everything but you're not sure that you've got it all,

16 here's the way that you can ensure that some new

17 arrangement that would otherwise fall within the

18 defined term is not going to be knocked out, and if you

19 want it to be knocked out, use the words means.

20 With respect to the second argument, that the

21 -- the core of Petitioner's position is that it can't

22 be held liable under RICO because it's simply

23 conducting its own business, and I think that's wrong

24 for two reasons.

25 First, there's no rule that says a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 corporation can't simultaneously in a single act be

2 conducting its own business and the business of a

3 separate enterprise, and I think H.J., Incorporated is

4 an example of that. The allegation in that case was

5 that a utility corporation and its officers had engaged

6 in a systematic pattern of bribing the members of a

7 public utility commission to allow the corporation to

8 charge higher rates. And the suit was allowed to go

9 forward on the theory that through the pattern of

10 bribery, the utility was, in practical terms,

11 participating in the conduct of the public utility

12 commission's affairs.

13 Now, clearly in attempting to bribe the

14 utility commission members, the utility was, in a

15 sense, conducting its own business. That is, viewed at

16 a high level of generality, efforts to persuade rate-

17 setting bodies to allow a utility to charge higher

18 rates are an integral part of the utility's own

19 business. That didn't prevent it from simultaneously

20 being a means of participating in the conduct of a

21 different entity's business.

22 And second, there's more alleged in this

23 complaint, and I think some of the questions brought

24 this out. May I finish my sentence?

25 There's more alleged in the complaint than

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 simply the unlawful hiring of illegal aliens. There

2 are hiring inducement and transporting offenses that

3 would constitute separate violations that are

4 antecedent to but not part of Mohawk's business.

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

6 Mr. Phillips, you have 4 minutes remaining.

7 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

10 Justice Ginsburg, let me -- let me try to

11 justify having this issue before the Court. First of

12 all, 1292(b) has never been as narrowly confined as you

13 suggest, and indeed, in this case, you know, what

14 you're entitled to do is to bring up any issues related

15 to the challenged order. And in this case we not only

16 raised the RICO issue, but we also raise State law

17 issues in the -- in the Eleventh Circuit which were not

18 within the specific grant and were entertained by the

19 Eleventh Circuit because that's the standard.

20 And then once you get past that, Justice

21 Kennedy is absolutely right. The issue is whether

22 there's an order to be reviewed. There is no final

23 judgment rule on claims coming out of the Federal

24 courts of appeals, and therefore, it's -- it's

25 absolutely fair game. And the issue is I -- I submit,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 fairly subsumed within the question presented.

2 Justice Souter, you know, with respect to the

3 ID cards, I think it's very important to recognize that

4 for us to do our business, we have to have an ID card

5 in order to fill out the forms necessary to satisfy the

6 immigration laws. So that -- you know, those ID cards

7 add nothing to the -- to the conduct of our business.

8 And, you know, Mr. Stewart just suggested

9 that, well, but you know, we do go beyond that and that

10 H.J. allows some a -- a different analysis of this

11 particular point. But H.J. preceded Reves. This Court

12 held in Reves that you have to distinguish between the

13 activities of the enterprise and the activities of the

14 defendant and -- and they've never made any effort to

15 do that. All they do is suggest we've engaged in

16 wrongdoing, that our third party recruiters engaged in

17 wrongdoing, and that we're a conspiracy. There's

18 nothing in there that remotely suggests that there is

19 an existing enterprise.

20 With respect to the question of how to

21 interpret this particular statute, Justice Scalia is

22 absolutely correct that at the end of the day, this is

23 at most an ambiguous provision, and if it's an

24 ambiguous provision, we ought to be entitled to the

25 rule of lenity. I didn't hear any adequate answer to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Justice Kennedy's specific question about why do they

2 use person in the subsection just ahead of it, if they

3 really meant to embrace everything here.

4 And it's no answer to say, well, enterprise

5 is a term that could be -- that has a general

6 background. Enterprise is the linchpin of this

7 statute. The notion that Congress didn't mean to very

8 specifically and explicitly define enterprise here is

9 absurd. Of course, it defined it, and it provided a

10 very specific and detailed definition. And it's not

11 free for the Government or for anyone else then to come

12 here and shunt aside that definition and say, well,

13 we're just going to deal with background principles.

14 The truth is they're trying to write out of

15 it groups of individuals acting in association. That

16 language is there. It was put there for a reason. The

17 Government concedes that it didn't -- that it never --

18 that Congress never had this issue in mind. How it can

19 be then that this is not at least sufficiently

20 ambiguous that you should construe it in our favor

21 strikes me as -- as very difficult to understand.

22 And finally, I don't -- I've never heard the

23 expression RICO-ize before, Justice Breyer, but I -- I

24 embrace it wholeheartedly because that is precisely

25 what we're talking about here. These are enormous

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

56
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 penalties that are imposed, and it's a statute that

2 this Court has recognized in the past, even on its own

3 terms, is very broad. Certainly there is no reason to

4 take those terms and RICO-ize the -- the breadth of

5 corporate activity that the plaintiffs' complaint in

6 this case would -- would allow. The Court should

7 reverse the decision below and dismiss this complaint,

8 just as the Seventh Circuit did.

9 If there are no further questions, thank you,

10 Your Honors.

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

12 Phillips.

13 The case is submitted.
