3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Case 14232, Harris v. The Arizona

5 Independent Redistricting Commission.

6             Mr. Hearne.

7            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK F. HEARNE, II

8                ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

9             MR. HEARNE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10 and may it please the Court:

11             The oneperson, onevote principle of the

12 Equal Protection Clause requires an apportionment

13 authority to make a goodfaith effort to equally

14 apportion the population as  as practically as

15 possible, and while deviations are tolerated, they are

16 only minor deviations made for legitimate purposes of a

17 rational State policy intended not to be discriminatory

18 or arbitrary.

19             Here, the Arizona Redistricting Commission

20 malapportioned Arizona State legislature by almost

21 10 percent, 8.8 percent, and the district court below

22 found it did so for two reasons.

23             The first reason was to obtain a partisan

24 advantage for the Democrat party.

25             The second reason was a perceived belief

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
5 1 that malapportioned districts were necessary to obtain 2 Justice Department preclearance approval. 3             Neither of these reasons justifies a 4 deviation from the constitutional principle of one 5 person, one vote. 6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Hearne  7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The second part, do  do 8 you want us  do you want us to overturn the factual 9 finding that compliance with the Voting Rights Act, 10 the  the preclearance procedures, was the reason  11 real reason for the deviation?  Do you want us to 12 overturn that as a factual finding? 13             MR. HEARNE:  No, I don't, as a factual 14 finding.  But when you say, Justice Kennedy, the 15 preclearance obtaining Voting Rights Act compliance, we 16 have said, as we've noted in the briefing, it was not 17 necessary to underpopulate districts to obtain 18 compliance with the Voting Rights Act. 19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I ask you a  a 20 question?  It's  it's odd that you're making this 21 charge that there was an impermissible effort to 22 increase the Democratic authority, power, in the 23 legislature, but the end result was that the Arizona 24 plan gave Republicans more than their proportionate 25 share of seats in the State legislature.  And I think
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
6 1 the numbers are, in total, Republicans won 56.6 percent 2 of the State Senate seats, 60 percent of the State House 3 seats.  And that exceeded the Republican party's 4 Statewide registration share of 54.4 percent. 5             So if there was an attempt to stack this in 6 favor of Democrats, it certainly failed. 7             MR. HEARNE:  Well, we would say, Your Honor, 8 that a  an incompetent gerrymander is no less a 9 gerrymander when it unequally apportions the population 10 than a competent gerrymander that obtained the partisan 11 objective. 12             I think the objective that we are trying to 13 achieve here is the oneperson, onevote standard.  And 14 that's why, whatever the ultimate political outcome, I 15 don't think that vindicates the fact that these are 16 unequally apportioned. 17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It  it  it's still not 18 clear to me what  what you want us to say about the  19 the Commission's rationale for compliance and Voting 20 Rights Act compliance that was wrong as a matter of law, 21 because if you don't overturn the factual finding that 22 they had a  a goodfaith belief that what they were 23 doing is correct, then  then you have  then you have 24 a problem, it seems to me. 25             Or do you have a problem?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
7 1             MR. HEARNE:  I don't believe I do, because I 2 think it's not  the goodfaith  what the district 3 court found was that their advisor told them, you can 4 depopulate districts up to 10 percent, and in fact, you 5 should do that because you need to create these 6 underpopulated minority districts to obtain 7 preclearance. 8             That is wrong.  The Voting Rights Act does 9 not command, does not compel or require, underpopulated 10 districts to obtain preclearance.  The Solicitor 11 Generals noted that as well in their briefing and the 12 Justice Department guidelines.  And that's  13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I  how 14 confident are you of that?  I mean, the  the 15 preclearance process at the Department of Justice is 16 famously opaque, and usually the States and 17 municipalities have to go through, or had to go through, 18 several layers of back and forth, here's a proposal  19 it's sort of a bargaining process.  I don't know how 20 confident you can be that  that it wasn't necessary. 21             MR. HEARNE:  We certainly agree that the 22 preclearance process was very opaque, as you said, 23 Mr. Chief Justice.  I mean, we said it was like reading 24 chicken entrails, because no one really knows what you 25 do or don't need to do to  to obtain preclearance.
Alderson Reporting Company

1             But just fundamentally, the Voting Rights

8

2 Act, even prior to Shelby County, could not compel a

3 redistricting authority to underpopulate districts.  So

4 the advice they had been given, you must underpopulate

5 these ten districts in order to obtain preclearance was

6 flawed as a matter of legal advice that doesn't justify

7 malapportionment.

8             So they could have achieved as, in fact,

9 their own expert, Dr. King, said.  In the first map 

10 they had two maps.  They had a draft map and a final

11 map.  The draft map had a 4 percent, roughly, deviation,

12 and their own expert said this map satisfies the Voting

13 Rights Act.

14             Then they went and depopulated further to

15 get an 8.8 percent deviation.

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So they were mistaken.  I

17 mean, you're  you say they  they could have done it

18 without  without disproportioning, but they  they

19 thought that that was okay.  They thought that they were

20 doing this in order to comply with the Justice

21 Department.

22             What's the test?  Is the test what they

23 intended, or is it an objective test?

24             MR. HEARNE:  Well, I think you have to look

25 at, actually, both.  I think you look at the objective

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 test is:  Does the Voting Rights Act require you to

9

2 depopulate districts?  That's bad 

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So let's assume the answer

4 to that is no.

5             MR. HEARNE:  Right.

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the people who  who

7 made this apportionment were mistaken, and they thought

8 that it allowed, and indeed may require, you to do that.

9 So?  That doesn't show a bad motive on their part, does

10 it?

11             MR. HEARNE:  No, but I don't think this

12 Court's ever held that bad legal advice justifies a

13 constitutional violation, which in this case that's what

14 they're saying is the 

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, bad legal advice is

16 different from an impermissible motive.

17             MR. HEARNE:  Well, we have a 

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Justice Scalia is asking

19 what  what  what the test  what is the test here?

20             MR. HEARNE:  Well, I would say this case, as

21 the district court noted, and all three judges split on

22 what the burden of proof was, is a mixedmotive case

23 where you have one assumed illegitimate motive, partisan

24 advantage, and you have another motive which is, oh,

25 it's okay because we needed to do this because our

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 advisor said that was necessary for preclearance.

10

2             Then I think it  the task falls to the

3 Commission to justify, under this Court's decisions in

4 Mt. Healthy and Arlington Heights standard of a

5 mixedmotive case to justify, oh, this was necessary in

6 fact to comply with that.

7             And that was not done.

8             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And  and it was more

9 than mixed motive.  It was a finding of dominance, that

10 the dominant purpose of this was to attempt to meet

11 Section 5.

12             MR. HEARNE:  Two of the judges, Judge

13 Clifton and Judge Silver, did find that that was a

14 predominant motive or primary motive.

15             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that's a  that's a

16 factfinding which you  you have a burden if you're

17 seeking to overturn it.

18             MR. HEARNE:  But they also found that there

19 was another illegitimate motive that they assumed 

20 Judge Silver didn't necessarily agree, but she assumed,

21 for purposes of decision, that this partisan advantage

22 was a illegitimate motive.

23             So you have a case where this body is

24 unconstitutionally departing from oneperson, onevote.

25 They come forward with two explanations, one

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 illegitimate, one supposedly legitimate:  This

11

2 preclearance based on erroneous legal advice.  And on

3 the basis of that, the court split on what the burden of

4 proof was.  We would 

5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Just to pin this down a  a

6 little bit, Mr. Hearne:  You  you are not contesting

7 the factual finding that the predominant motive was to

8 comply with the Voting Rights Act; is that right?

9             MR. HEARNE:  We  we take the  the

10 factual findings from the district court.  We don't

11 protest those.  But what we do believe is that the court

12 applied the wrong burdenshifting standard in that, in

13 their analysis of those facts.

14             When they have a mixed motive, the proper

15 response would have been to say, okay, you've shown, we

16 found one illegitimate motive.

17             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, you keep on saying

18 mixed motive, and I guess people keep on coming back to

19 you and just trying to figure out whether you are, in

20 fact, or are not, in fact, contesting that  that the

21 predominant motive was the Voting Rights Act.

22             MR. HEARNE:  The  when  when we say the

23 Voting Rights Act  again, I want to make my position

24 clear 

25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Was the attempt to comply

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 with the Voting Rights Act?

12

2             MR. HEARNE:  Correct.

3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And this  and the  and

4 the court found, and it is a factual finding, that

5 that's the predominant motive?

6             And I don't mean to harangue you on this.  I

7 just want to understand what your argument is.

8             MR. HEARNE:  No.  We  we  we  to be

9 very clear, yes, we accept the factual finding of the

10 two judges, that that was  what they said was the

11 primary motive.  But they erred when they did not shift

12 the burden in a mixedmotive case, under Arlington

13 Heights, I think footnote 21, or Mt. Healthy, kind of

14 standard.

15             Secondly, they erred when they gave a

16 justification and found it legitimate when there really

17 was not a legal need to do what they did.  There was

18 no  the Voting Rights Act can't compel vote dilution.

19 And that justification, even if it was had in good

20 faith, does not excuse a constitutional violation of

21 oneperson, onevote.

22             So at minimum, it would need to be remanded

23 for an opportunity for them to somehow  the

24 Commission  explain why they can justify these

25 population deviations.  And that's  that is our

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 position, Justice Kagan.

13

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You  I'm  I'm even

3 further confused.  I  I understand that you gave up

4 any racial or  or political gerrymandering case.  This

5 is just a voterdilution case.

6             MR. HEARNE:  That's absolutely correct,

7 Justice Sotomayor.

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, I understand

9 there's one case you're relying on that was summarily

10 affirmed, but is there any other case from this Court

11 that has ever said that a  a deviation of this amount

12 is significant?

13             I think we've always called it anything

14 below 9 percent de minimis, correct?

15             MR. HEARNE:  What the Court has said, as I

16 read the jurisprudence, is that a deviation of over

17 10 percent is prima facie constitutional, and the

18 statements justify it.

19             If it's a deviation of less than 10 percent,

20 the obligation is on the party challenging it to come

21 forward and present some evidence showing that it is

22 done for an arbitrary or discriminatory purpose.

23             That's what we understand that standard to

24 be out of Brown v. Thomson.  And again, that was a

25 plurality opinion.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             But under that standard 

14

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I  I don't actually

3 understand.  I don't know of any case where we've

4 required an explanation under 10 percent.

5             MR. HEARNE:  Well, I think two  I have two

6 responses to that, Justice Sotomayor.  First in Cox v.

7 Larios, certainly this Court had a summary affirmance,

8 and the concurring opinion in that case by Justice

9 Stevens and Breyer does say that there is not this magic

10 bright line, and then other decisions of this Court have

11 always disavowed creating some simple brightline test

12 where deviations from the constitutional standard below

13 that are tolerated.

14             So, for example in Karcher, that decision

15 said we specifically don't want to set some line,

16 because the minute we do that, legislators or

17 redistricting authorities will immediately use that as

18 the new standard.

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, in fact, they

20 have.  They've pretty much used 10 percent.  We've not

21 discouraged them from doing that.

22             MR. HEARNE:  It is certainly  it certainly

23 appeared in some of the district court decisions 

24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I 

25             MR. HEARNE:   that  that's  that they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 have looked at that.  And again, we see that as the

15

2 burden shift 

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  What it says, actually, in

4 Brown v. Thomson, it says our decisions have

5 established, as a general matter, that an apportionate

6 plan with a maximum population deviation under

7 10 percent falls within this category of minor

8 deviations.  And what we held previously was that minor

9 deviations from mathematical equality among State

10 legislatures are insufficient to make out a prima facie

11 case of invidious discrimination.

12             All right.  So that's the holding of the

13 Court.  And this seems to be within the category of

14 minor deviations where you have to make out  you have

15 to do something more than you would have to do if it

16 were a  larger than 10 percent.

17             MR. HEARNE:  Right.

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, what do you think you

19 have to do?

20             MR. HEARNE:  Well, I think we have to do,

21 Justice Breyer, what we did, which is to come to the

22 court  to come to a district court and to present to

23 them evidence which the district court found of you have

24 a deviation that, though minor, is done for an

25 illegitimate purpose.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
16 1             And yes, there was this other pretext of the 2 preclearance issue.  That satisfied the burden of 3 requiring judicial scrutiny of that redistricting, and 4 so we have satisfied that burden. 5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why bother having a 6 minor?  Don't you think this will lead every single plan 7 to be challenged as voter dilution? 8             MR. HEARNE:  Well, no.  I think that you 9 would have to still have a showing of an illegitimate 10 purpose behind the deviation. 11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You didn't show that.  You 12 didn't just establish it by the fact of the deviation. 13             What kind of evidence did you present to the 14 district court? 15             MR. HEARNE:  Well, I think in this case, 16 this  this case is a very unique case because, as 17 Judge Wake found in his dissent, the chart shows 18 statistically that there was systematic, partisan 19 malapportionment done for that partisan reason.  Just 20 looking at the numbers  21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Looking at the chart at 22 112a of the appendix? 23             MR. HEARNE:  Yes.  I think that if it is  24 it is the chart that is in color, I think we've also 25 provided 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
17 1             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's got the color chart. 2             MR. HEARNE:  Yes.  And it shows that the 3 districts were systemically, statistically 4 malapportioned for that purpose. 5             So that would be the kind of showing, 6 Justice Scalia, that you would be  7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I  I thought  I  I 8 thought, Mr. Hearne, that you were saying that the  9 that the thing that you had presented had to do with an 10 impermissible motive, and the impermissible motive was 11 that they didn't have to do all this for Voting Rights 12 Act compliance; is that right? 13             MR. HEARNE:  I'd say there's two  the  14 the first impermissible motive or illegitimate 15 justification is partisanship, to gain an advantage  16             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  But that's the very 17 thing that you said, you weren't challenging the factual 18 finding, that that was a subsidiary part of the 19 redistricting. 20             MR. HEARNE:  That was  21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  The dominant part was the 22 voting rights compliance, and I take it you want to 23 undermine the voting rights compliance rationale. 24             But then I'm stuck on the same question that 25 Justice Scalia is stuck on, is what evidence did you
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
18 1 present that  that there was an impermissible motive 2 with respect to that, as opposed to different views as 3 to what the Voting Rights Act compelled. 4             MR. HEARNE:  Two quick answers to that, 5 Justice Kagan. 6             First is, legally the justice  the Voting 7 Rights Act couldn't compel them to do what they did, so 8 that justification legally is invalid. 9             Secondly, we bring up that point about the 10 burden shift with Arlington Heights and Mt. Healthy, 11 where when we show an illegitimate motive partisanship, 12 then the burden  task falls to the Commission to 13 justify that. 14             And I would reserve the balance of my time. 15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 16             General Brnovich. 17            ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN.

19 1 draw districts of unequal population.  All sides agree 2 that these deviations were not random, or that they were 3 not incidental. 4             We also know, and the record shows and no 5 one disagrees, that this pattern to underpopulate 6 minority districts was done to help create or further 7 ability to elect districts.  And we also know that the 8 direct evidence is they did it intentionally. 9             So why are we here today?  In the background 10 versus Reynolds v. Sims, this Court has always held that 11 equal protection is not a criteria  another factor 12 when it comes to redistricting, but it is essentially 13 the background in which all redistricting ledges take 14 place. 15             The State of Arizona and the Secretary do 16 not dispute the compliance with the Voting Rights Act 17 was a legitimate or is a legitimate State interest.  And 18 we don't dispute that maybe there was an  a good 19 motive on the part of drawing these districts.  The 20 problem is those motives don't matter when what you have 21 is an undermining of the fundamental principle of 22 oneperson, onevote. 23             So in this case, what we have is a violation 24 of the Equal Protection Clause, because by intentionally 25 and systemically underpopulating those minority
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 abilitytoelect districts, the IRC violated Equal

20

2 Protection Clause in that principle of oneperson,

3 onevote.

4             So essentially what happened was by

5 overpopulating the other districts, the voters in the

6 overpopulated districts had their votes diluted.  And

7 by  by diluting those votes, it violated the

8 Constitution.

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It sounds fundamental that

10 a statute can't authorize a constitutional violation, so

11 that even an attempt to comply with the Voting Rights

12 Act is not sufficient if it violates the Equal

13 Protection Clause.

14             Have we ever said that  I mean it's

15 obvious, but have we ever said that in the context of

16 what the voting rights requires?

17             MR. BRNOVICH:  Your Honor, this  this

18 Court has consistently, from Reynolds v. Sims, has

19 always held that the concept and the principle of

20 oneperson, onevote, any attempts to undermine that

21 outside 

22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So we have said that

23 even  you read our cases saying even minor deviations

24 are not permitted if they are statutorily required?

25             GENERAL BRNOVICH:  No statute can trump the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Constitution, and so if  the Voting Rights Act,

21

2 whichever way it's read, can't be read in a way that

3 would violate the oneperson, onevote.

4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's what Judge Wake

5 said in his dissent.

6             MR. BRNOVICH:  And that's exactly what Judge

7 Wake said in his dissent.

8             And that is the State's position, is that we

9 don't dispute  or we're not saying that complying with

10 the Voting Rights Act may indeed be a legitimate State

11 interest.  What we are saying is, is that when it's done

12 in the systematic way where you have a oneway ratchet,

13 where you have consistently minority abilitytoelect

14 districts, essentially using votes based on racial or

15 ethnic classifications, and underpopulating those

16 districts and then overpopulating other districts, what

17 you have done is essentially undervalued or violated the

18 oneperson, onevote 

19             JUSTICE ALITO:  Would you say it's correct

20 that compliance with the Voting Rights Act, the desire

21 to obtain preclearance, is at least like other

22 traditional districting considerations, like respecting

23 county lines, respecting municipal lines, having

24 contiguous districts?  Would you agree with that?

25             GENERAL BRNOVICH:  Yes, Justice Alito.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE ALITO:  So if  if that is the

22

2 case, then is this what you were asking us to say with

3 respect to the Voting Rights Act, that the things that

4 were really necessary to obtain preclearance are

5 legitimate, but you can't go  but they went further.

6 They  they went beyond what was really necessary to

7 obtain preclearance, so we would have to determine

8 whether that was true or not, or some court would have

9 to determine whether that was true or not.

10             MR. BRNOVICH:  In this instance, because of

11 the systematic way the deviations, the underpopulation

12 occurred, as well as the intention  we know from the

13 Independent Redistricting Commission that they

14 intentionally underpopulated those districts.  So we

15 have all that evidence.

16             However, we do believe that the Voting

17 Rights Act is like any other criteria.  So if you get

18 these population deviations and they're incidental, not

19 intentional  and that is the key, I believe, is when

20 you intentionally underpopulate and systemically

21 underpopulate these districts  that's what causes the

22 constitutional harm.

23             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if the only way

24 that you  that a State could obtain preclearance when

25 Section 5 was still in force was to underpopulate some

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 districts?  Would that be permissible?

23

2             GENERAL BRNOVICH:  Well 

3             JUSTICE ALITO:  Just as you might have a

4 situation where the only way in which you could respect

5 municipal lines or county lines was to underpopulate

6 some districts to some degree.

7             MR. BRNOVICH:  Justice Alito, the irony is

8 in the draft maps; seven of the ten minority

9 abilitytoelect districts were underpopulated.

10 However, when the Independent Redistricting Commission

11 went from the draft maps to the final maps, there was a

12 oneway ratchet.  They intentionally and systemically

13 underpopulated those districts.

14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But Justice Alito can

15 protect his own question, but he's asking you whether or

16 not a deviation is permissible for protecting

17 communities of interest, protecting municipal lines,

18 whether some slight deviation is permissible.

19             MR. BRNOVICH:  Yes.  Yes, Justice Kennedy,

20 if it's incidental and not intentional.

21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I'm not sure what

22 that means.

23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, I'm not sure.  I had

24 thought you  I had thought you were saying that it

25 doesn't matter whether you were doing it to obtain

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
24 1 Justice Department clearance.  You cannot do something 2 that is unconstitutional. 3             MR. BRNOVICH:  That is  4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  If in fact you're  you 5 don't have equally apportioned districts, it goes beyond 6 what is tolerable.  It's a violation, regardless of 7 whether you're  you're actually trying to comply with 8 the Justice Department.  Isn't that what you were 9 saying? 10             MR. BRNOVICH:  Yes, Justice Scalia, but I 11 think that it's important to note that we look at this 12 as a qualitative not a quantitative analysis.  So there 13 isn't like some magic number where you say at this point 14 this becomes unconstitutional or it doesn't. 15             The State's position is, is that compliance 16 with the Voting Rights Act was like other neutral or 17 traditional criteria, like protecting, as Justice Alito 18 alluded to, communities of interest, geographical 19 boundaries.  And so in that  in considering that, you 20 may have incidences where you get somebody  some 21 districts above or below the line. 22             So the fact that a district may be below the 23 line in and of itself is not a constitutional violation. 24 The harm occurs when the Independent Redistricting 25 Commission systemically underpopulates those
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 districts  those abilitytoelect districts, and

25

2 overpopulates other districts thereby 

3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can you explain 

4             MR. BRNOVICH:   diluting the votes of

5 those people.

6             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I'm just not really

7 sure.  Let's  let's say that there's a policy that

8 says we want to respect county lines.  And we also know

9 that we want to do oneperson, onevote, but we think we

10 have, basically, some leeway up to 10 percent.  And 

11 and there's a policy.  We want to respect county lines,

12 even though that's going to cause a little bit more

13 deviation on the oneperson, onevote metric.  Are you

14 saying that that's impermissible?

15             MR. BRNOVICH:  Justice Kagan, we are

16 saying 

17             JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's a policy.  I mean, it's

18 an intentional policy.

19             MR. BRNOVICH:  I guess, you know, the road

20 to hell is paved with good intentions.  And so our

21 position is, regardless of their intention, if they are

22 doing it in a systematic way or intending to

23 overpopulate certain districts, underpopulate other

24 districts, that is unconstitutional.

25             The Voting Rights Act then would 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
26 1             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Even though it just, say, 2 takes you from 4 to 5 percent, or from 7 to 8 percent. 3 You're not crossing the 10 percent threshold.  But as 4 long as you're going up, and you're doing it 5 purposefully  6             MR. BRNOVICH:  Yes. 7             JUSTICE KAGAN:   in the sense of we have a 8 policy to maintain county lines, that's impermissible? 9             MR. BRNOVICH:  Yes, Justice Kagan.  The 10 position of the State is that when it's done in a 11 systematic and intentional manner, when you create, 12 essentially, barrios of  boroughs, excuse me  of 13 certain folks, and then you overpopulate other 14 districts, that violates this Court's oneperson, 15 onevote principle. 16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  General Brnovich, just as a 17 matter of curiosity, how do you end up being on this 18 side of the case?  You  you were defended in the 19 district court, weren't you? 20             MR. BRNOVICH:  The  the Secretary in the 21 State thought the principle of oneperson, onevote and 22 upholding that principle was very, very important, and 23 that's why we felt compelled to be involved in this  24 this case. 25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but only on appeal.
Alderson Reporting Company

27 1 You didn't argue this side in the district court, did 2 you? 3             MR. BRNOVICH:  That  that's is correct, 4 Your  Justice Scalia. 5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What happened?  Was there 6 an election in between or something? 7             (Laughter.) 8             MR. BRNOVICH:  Yes, and I won 9 overwhelmingly. 10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I knew it. 11             MR. BRNOVICH:  Thanks.  Thank you very much. 12 I will be up for reelection in three more years, so 13 the ... anyway. 14             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you  do you agree 15 with your colleague that it doesn't make any difference; 16 that in the end result, the  the legislature  that 17 the Republicans were disproportionately advantaged, had 18 a disproportionate share of the seats? 19             MR. BRNOVICH:  Yes, Justice.  Our  our 20 position is, is that that really is irrelevant as far as 21 the numbers ultimately, whether the percentage  22             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Whether it would have 23 ended up, if you're right, an even greater 24 disproportion  a greater disproportion of Republican 25 representatives.

1             MR. BRNOVICH:  And so ultimately the

28

2 number  this is not a line drawing case; this is an

3 overpopulation/underpopulation case.  So how the lines

4 are drawn, and what the Republican or Democratic

5 representation is in the State House or the State Senate

6 is not important or not key to our argument.

7             Our  the key to the State's argument is

8 that this intentional and systematic oneway ratcheting

9 of underpopulating minority abilitytoelect districts

10 is what undermines the oneperson, onevote principle,

11 and what makes the actions of the IRC unconstitutional.

15              ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

16                 ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

17       ARIZONA INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION

18             MR. SMITH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19 please the Court:

20             There is no basis for concluding that the

21 minor, modest population variances among the districts

22 in the Arizona map violate the Equal Protection Clause.

23 That's because 

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you  do you accept

25 the  the fact  speaking of accepting factfinding,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 do you accept the factfinding that at least part of the 2 motive was partisan? 3             MR. SMITH:  I don't think that's a fair 4 characterization of what the district court found, Your 5 Honor. 6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, really?  Why? 7             MR. SMITH:  The district court found that 8 the predominant motive for the under  for the 9 population  10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Predominant motive.  That's 11 right. 12             MR. SMITH:  It said that  that there may 13 have been two of the five commissioners who, as to one 14 district, District 8, had some mixed motives in  in 15 urging that that district be made more competitive, but 16 did not find that the Commission as a whole acted, even 17 in that one instance, with partisan motivations, and 18 it  that district is not one of the ones that's 19 significantly underpopulated. 20             The decision to move population around and 21 make that district somewhat more competitive, even if it 22 was motivated by partisanship, has nothing to do with 23 what we're really talking about here, which is the 8.8 24 deviation. 25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you know, I would be
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
30 1 very upset if  if it  there was any motivation of 2 partisanship because  I wish this case had come up 3 before the case we had last term, which  which 4 approved your commission, despite the  the text of the 5 Constitution  6             (Laughter.) 7             JUSTICE SCALIA:   because this commission 8 was going to end partisanship, get politics out of 9 redistricting.  And here the very next term we have this 10 case which  which asserts that there has been a lot of 11 partisanship on the part of this  12             MR. SMITH:  With respect  13             JUSTICE SCALIA:   supposedly divine 14 commission. 15             MR. SMITH:  Not a fair characterization of 16 what happened, and not a fair characterization of what 17 the district court found after a full trial.  What it 18 found, after giving them a full opportunity to try to 19 prove their claim that there was some invidious 20 discrimination here, is that's simply not what happened. 21             Instead what happened is that they had  22 these population deviations emerged in the final part of 23 the process as they worked to make sure that their map 24 would pass preclearance on the first try, something that 25 the State of Arizona had failed to achieve in each of
Alderson Reporting Company

1 the three previous decades.

31

2             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the district court

3 found  and this is on 79a of the Appendix to the

4 Jurisdictional Statement  "partisanship played some

5 role."  So do you want us to interpret that to mean that

6 if there was no partisanship, everything would have come

7 out exactly the same way?  It had no affect whatsoever

8 on the districting?

9             MR. SMITH:  What the court said was with

10 respect to the changes to District 8, which by the way,

11 remained a largely Republicanleaning competitive

12 district, that two of the commissioners may have had

13 mixed motives, both thinking about aiding the

14 preclearance arguments and also thinking about bringing

15 the Democratic party up closer to parity, it still

16 didn't get to parity.

17             And I think that to say 

18             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's a  that's a

19 red herring.  We don't need to discuss the issue of

20 parity.  If you have a system of proportional

21 representation and you get 55 percent of the vote,

22 you'll get 55 percent of the  of the representatives.

23             But in the kind of electoral system we have

24 in the United States, with singlemember districts and

25 winnertakeall, a neutral  a neutral districting plan

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 will never produce exactly the same breakdown of

32

2 legislators as the breakdown of the votes in the

3 election.  But that's  I mean, that's a side issue.

4 What do we do with this statement:  Partisanship played

5 some role?

6             MR. SMITH:  Your Honor, partisanship by

7 itself cannot violate the Constitution.  You have a 

8 you have  even if it  even if you inflate that far

9 beyond what was intended by the judges who wrote that

10 opinion, the case of Gaffney v. Cummings was a case

11 where you had partisanship being the dominant,

12 controlling factor in every single line that was drawn.

13             JUSTICE ALITO:  This is what  this is what

14 interests me about the case.  If we assume, as the

15 district court did, that partisanship is not a

16 legitimate consideration, and it's not, like, respecting

17 county lines, and if we interpret the district court's

18 opinion as finding that partisanship was part of the

19 reason for the plan that was adopted, then is the test,

20 the Mt. Healthy test  which in my understanding is

21 what we normally apply in a constitutional mixed motive

22 situation.

23             So that if an illegitimate, unconstitutional

24 consideration is one of the reasons, the burden shifts

25 to the defendant to show that things would have come out

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
33 1 the same way, even if that factor had not been in the 2 case, or is it what the court said in Bush v. Vera and a 3 few other cases, that in this particular context, that's 4 not the test?  The test is whether the illegitimate 5 factor there, race, was the predominant consideration. 6             MR. SMITH:  Well, that's  7             JUSTICE ALITO:  It seems to me it  it 8 turns on the choice between the two. 9             MR. SMITH:  Well, this accepting a lot of  10             JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that a wrong? 11             MR. SMITH:  Accepting a lot of the premises 12 of the question, which I think are counterfactual, about 13 the opinion and  and what was found here and all of 14 that, it does seem to me that even if you're going to 15 make partisanship something illegitimate and 16 redistricting, which seems kind of like a fool's errand, 17 frankly, it ought to at least have to be predominate.  I 18 mean, in a situation where  you wouldn't  you 19 wouldn't want to say that the  that the  the  the 20 line drawers have to have complete purity of heart. 21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, aren't you saying 22 that it's permissible to use, as one factor, an illegal 23 standard if there are some other factors that are also 24 in play?  That it's permissible to use an illegal 25 standard, in part?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. SMITH:  If there were 

34

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that what you want us

3 to write in this opinion?

4             MR. SMITH:  No, your Honor.  Nobody thinks

5 that it's illegal to consider 

6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that's one of the

7 issues in the case.  We'll talk about that later, about

8 partisanship.  If you  if you want to say it doesn't

9 make any difference because partisanship is  is a

10 valid consideration, fine.  That's your point.  But my

11 question is, it sounds to me, in response to your answer

12 to Justice Alito, that you're saying that it is all

13 right to use an illegal standard, in part, to reduce

14 equal  equal representation.

15             MR. SMITH:  For all the same reasons that

16 the Court has many times said we're not going to say any

17 racial consciousness is enough to invalidate it unless

18 it predominates, I would think you would want to follow

19 the same approach, even if you're going to adopt the

20 parity between racial considerations and partisan

21 considerations, which makes no sense.  You're entire

22 Shaw v. Reno line of cases is about trying to decide

23 whether it's race or party, and when you come to the

24 conclusion easily that it's party, then it's okay.

25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can I put in my notes that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 you're arguing that partisanship is a valid

35

2 consideration in redistricting?  Is that what you want

3 me to say?

4             MR. SMITH:  You  you  you certainly can,

5 Your Honor.  You said it last year in the Alabama case.

6 You said political affiliation is one of the legitimate

7 traditional redistricting criteria that line drawers

8 always can consider.  That it's 

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the problem.

10 There  there is  I'm suddenly waking up here and

11 following 

12             MR. SMITH:  That's your opinion, Your Honor.

13             (Laughter.)

14             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well  well, how  how do

15 you  it's a  how  how do we write this?  There are

16 two areas that are difficult to write.

17             One is, I know there is this 10 percent

18 rule, but it doesn't say we don't look at it at all.  We

19 institutionally can't review thousands of pages of

20 record in every redistricting case.  So what are the

21 words there that describe the standard we should bring

22 to this?

23             And the second, which is a direct

24 application of the first, is you're quite right.  How

25 can we say that partisanship can't be used at all when

Alderson Reporting Company

36

2 limit.  Vieth.

3             MR. SMITH:  Vieth.

4             JUSTICE BREYER:  When in fact  of course,

5 I dissented there.  I  but the sky is the limit when

6 you're drawing boundaries.

7             Now, how do we reconcile  how do we

8 reconcile our institutional ability with the need to

9 have some policing here?  And how do we reconcile what

10 we say in this case with what we've held in the

11 linedrawing area?

12             MR. SMITH:  Okay.

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, those  those are two

14 questions in the back of my mind, and I'd like to have

15 your position.

16             MR. SMITH:  Can I answer the second question

17 first, Your Honor?

19             (Laughter.)

20             MR. SMITH:  It  it seems to me like it

21 would be  like it would be not  not defensible to

22 adopt a rule that says partisanship in creating minor

23 population deviations is actionable absent some effect

24 in terms of biasing the map, whereas in the  in the

25 linedrawing area, the Vieth situation, you have always

Alderson Reporting Company

37 1 insisted that there not only be a bias effect, but it be 2 very large. 3             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I didn't ask you what 4 we shouldn't say.  I asked you what we should say. 5             MR. SMITH:  What you should say is  what 6 you should apply is the rule that  that applied in all 7 of these cases about minor population deviations:  Is 8 there a rational, legitimate policy that the State can 9 articulate which is the reason why they arrived at this 10 difference?  And here we have, the Voting Rights Act is 11 the rational and legitimate State policy. 12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, let's not  13 let's talk about that for a second.  If action in 14 redistricting or overpopulation would constitute 15 illegitimate racial discrimination, can the answer that 16 we're doing that to comply to get preclearance from the 17 Justice Department legitimize that? 18             MR. SMITH:  Yes, Your Honor.  This Court has 19 said a number of times that complying with the Voting 20 Rights Act is a compelling State interest.  It  it 21 assumed that just last year. 22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, my  my 23 question is if the action that is taken would otherwise 24 constitute illegitimate racial discrimination.  I'm 25 trying to find out if the Justice Department's
Alderson Reporting Company

1 procedures can trump the requirements of the

38

2 Constitution.  In other words, it's  it's an issue

3 of  you know, we  we said in Ricci v. DeStefano that

4 it's not an excuse  not a complete excuse for

5 intentional discrimination, that you're trying to avoid

6 liability under Title VII 

7             MR. SMITH:  Right.

8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   for

9 discrimination on the basis of effects.

10             MR. SMITH:  Right.

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And I'm wondering if

12 it's somehow different.  If the Justice Department is

13 insisting on conduct that would constitute a violation,

14 if they're insisting on more than they should be, is

15 that a defense for the  for the redistricting?

16             MR. SMITH:  Well, Your Honor, the one thing

17 that is clear, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the Voting

18 Rights Act does require people drawing lines to consider

19 race.  And Section 5 required it to avoid retrogression.

20 Section 2 requires it right now.

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand that.

22             MR. SMITH:  So 

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it doesn't say

24 that all bets are off.

25             MR. SMITH:  No, Your Honor.  The  what 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
39 1 the line this Court has drawn is between maps which go 2 too far and maps which don't, maps in which the racial 3 considerations predominate and subordinate all other 4 traditional districting principles here.  And what you 5 have in this case is the quintessential map where that's 6 not true, where  7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it seems to me 8 you're avoiding my question. 9             MR. SMITH:  Sorry. 10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if the 11 requirements that the Justice Department asks for, for 12 preclearance go too far? 13             MR. SMITH:  Well, I think if the  the 14 Justice Department reads the Voting Rights Act in a 15 manner that requires them to do something that would go 16 too far in the predominant sense, there might be a 17 constitutional problem.  There's no indication here that 18 that's what happens.  Nobody  19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  So  so 20 whether or not preclearance is a defense depends upon 21 whether the Justice Department is insisting on too much. 22             MR. SMITH:  It  it could be, Your Honor. 23 There's  but there's no indication of anything of  24 like that here.  This is a case where they simply said 25 no retrogression.  This is not like the '90s, where they
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
40 1 were saying you have to create new districts, no matter 2 how ugly, to comply with  3             JUSTICE BREYER:  Look at the finding to 4 support what the  the Chief Justice is drawing there. 5 While partisanship played a role in the increased 6 population deviation associated with changing 7 District 8, so, too, did the preclearance goal play a 8 role in motivating the change.  It's the first half of 9 the sentence which is raising the issue that I think 10 people are trying to  to get you to say how we write 11 that.  You see?  Because it says it played a role. 12             And so we're going to be asked here by the 13 other side to expand on what that means, "play a role," 14 and we have to write an opinion.  And if you win this 15 case, there will have to be words that support you. 16             And so how do we take this thing?  What 17 would you say about the words "play a role"? 18             MR. SMITH:  I would say two things, Your 19 Honor. 20             First of all, it's a tiny role in this case. 21             But second of all, even if it were the only 22 reason why you had a  population deviations under 23 10 percent, I think it would be not defensible for this 24 Court to say that, by itself, is unconstitutional. 25             There is so  de minimis effect on any
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
41 1 interest in terms of representation from this difference 2 of population, absent some bias in the way that the 3 districts elect candidates, that it's simply not a 4 constitutional problem that you ought to recognize where 5 the  even if the pure motive was  was partisanship, 6 it's simply not something that ought to be taken 7 seriously as a constitutional problem. 8             But here, where the predominant motive is to 9 try to make sure these districts will pass preclearance, 10 and less than 50  50 percent of the commissioners may 11 have had, for one district, where they increased the 12 deviation slightly, like .2 percent, may have had some 13 partisanship as well as the Voting Rights Act in mind 14 for District 8.  Not one of the ten that were offered to 15 the Justice Department as abilitytoelect districts. 16 That's a tiny, tiny, tiny sliver of partisanship for 17 less than the full commission.  It was never  18             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if there were? 19 What if there were a case where the  the commissioner 20 or whoever was responsible for producing the plan 21 produced  chose between two plans.  Plan A has a 22 deviation of .1 percent; Plan B has a deviation of 23 9.9 percent.  And they write a report, and they say, 24 well, we  it came down to these two plans, and we 25 chose B, because we want to maximize the representation

42

2             And you would say that that would be

3 constitutional?

4             MR. SMITH:  I think if  if that's the only

5 thing that they  that  that was problematic about

6 the map, you might well say that's constitutional.  But

7 that's  that's not this case, obviously.

8             JUSTICE ALITO:  No, it's not this case, but

9 it 

10             MR. SMITH:  And it  it  you know, you've

11 gone as far as Larios.  You've said a map that's an 

12 an egregious gerrymander, massive disparate pairing of

13 incumbents, plus the not  intentional abuse of the

14 10 percent rule at 9.98 percent, all of that together,

15 you summarily affirmed a finding of unconstitutionality.

16             But by itself, I don't know that I would

17 even say that 

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's because

19 there's no constitutional criterion for where you draw

20 the district lines.  There is a constitutional criterion

21 for  for how you  how you weigh voters, district by

22 district.  There is.

23             MR. SMITH:  Yes, Your Honor.

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oneperson, onevote.

25 There's  there's no  no such criterion for where the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 location of a district line has to be.

43

2             MR. SMITH:  But this Court has said, over

3 and over again, we want to give States leeway in this

4 area, because representation is often better if you give

5 them some chance to make districts within the 10 percent

6 band.  And if you allow them to do what's  what's

7 being suggested here, to accuse  to bring partisanship

8 in and they can get to Federal court and they can get to

9 trial just by that, then exactly what you said is going

10 to happen in  in your dissent in Larios.  Every 

11 everybody with a  with a political motivation to try

12 to do something to undercut a map is going to come in.

13 It's easy enough to  to allege partisanship.  Here

14 the  all  the only evidence they have of

15 partisanship, leaving aside the little story of

16 District 8, is simply the pattern, that the Hispanic

17 districts they underpopulated and the Native American

18 district happened to vote Democratic.  So you have this

19 pattern.  The chart on  they point to on page 112a,

20 but that's not evidence.  It's equally consistent with

21 what the court found happened, which is they wanted to

22 make these districts more persuasive as abilitytoelect

23 districts so they could get preclearance.  And voila,

24 they got preclearance.

25             This is a  this is a case where you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 wonder:  Where's the beef?  What exactly are we here

44

2 for?  There's no problem with this map.  It's not a

3 partisan gerrymander.  It's not a racial gerrymander.

4 It's within the 10 percent boundary.  They  they did

5 everything in open.

6             Everything that  that's being complained

7 about here, all of this underpopulation of these

8 districts that was done at the  was done unanimously

9 by all five commissioners who adopted the goal of

10 getting preclearance, who adopted the  the  the idea

11 that they had to get 10 districts, not eight districts,

12 that every single change to those 10 districts that

13 increased their underpopulation was unanimously voted

14 by all five commissioners.  This is a case where there

15 is simply nothing seriously being argued here that could

16 possibly amount to a constitutional violation.

17             And it seems to me that we can talk about

18 whether a pure partisan case ought to, by itself, if the

19 only  if the only problem is deviation, to be

20 unconstitutional, I would recommend that you not do that

21 for the reasons you said in your dissent in Larios.

22 But, boy, this  this case is so far from that.  I

23 mean, the Republican commissioner  appointed

24 commissioners are voting for everything that they're

25 complaining about because they, too, want to get

45

2             The State of Arizona wants very much to have

3 its map go into effect for the first time since the

4 1960s when it became covered by the Voting Rights Act,

5 rather than having a Federal court have to put the map

6 into effect because preclearance was denied.

7             And they  they hire lawyers who worked in

8 the Justice Department, told them how many districts

9 they needed, told them that if necessary in rejiggering

10 these lines, they could go down  up to the 10 percent

11 limit.  They then tried very hard to minimize that.

12             And one of the things that's important to

13 recognize here is you could have probably equalized the

14 population here and still gotten districts to the same

15 level of Hispanic population, but you would have had to

16 draw tentacles of the kind that the Court has many times

17 criticized.  There's lots and lots of other Hispanic

18 people in the State of Arizona who are not in these

19 districts, but that's because they're spread out all

20 over the place.

21             And so if you're going to draw compact

22 districts, if you're going to draw districts that

23 respect county boundaries, if you're going  and census

24 tracts and communities of interests, something has to

25 give.  And what gave here was this modest, tiny, small

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1 amount of population variation that seems to me just not 2 a serious candidate for any kind of constitutional 3 invalidation on the facts of this case, which aren't 4 even challenged here, is clearly erroneous. 5             If the Court has no further questions, thank 6 you. 7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 8             Ms. Harrington. 9           ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON 10     FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING 11  APPELLEE ARIZONA INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION 12             MS. HARRINGTON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 13 Justice, and may it please the Court: 14             The question in this case is not whether 15 Section 5 can compel deviations from a perfect 16 population standard.  The question is whether de minimis 17 deviations are permitted by the Constitution.  This 18 Court has made very clear that when State districting 19 plans are within the 10 percent deviation, total 20 deviation from a perfect population equality standard, 21 those plans are presumed to be constitutional. 22             Now, that presumption is a substantive rule 23 that serves three important principles. 24             Just if I can briefly tick them off, the 25 first is that such de minimis deviations do not by
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
47 1 themselves violate equal protection.  The second is that 2 giving States a 10 percent leeway actually enhances 3 citizens' fair and equal representation by allowing 4 States to pursue other important districting principles. 5 And the third is that limiting Federal court 6 intervention in de minimis deviation cases protects 7 State's sovereign right to draw districts for their own 8 legislature. 9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is  is 10 percent 10 really de minimis?  I mean, I think you can say it's 11 minor, but de minimis strikes me as misleading when 12 you're talking about 10 percent. 13             MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, I certainly don't 14 mean to be misleading about this term that this Court 15 has used  16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I know it has, yes. 17             (Laughter.) 18             MS. HARRINGTON:  I would never accuse the 19 Court of being misleading.  I mean, I think the point 20 that the Court has made is that these sort of, you know, 21 10 percent deviations from perfect population equality 22 don't have enough of a dilutive effect to really affect 23 any citizen's right to fair and equal  24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does anybody contest that? 25 I don't think that's contested here.  I think the other
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
48 1 side is willing to  to concede that it's presumptively 2 okay, which means they have to come forward to show that 3 there were invalid reasons why there is this 4 discrepancy.  Right? 5             MS. HARRINGTON:  That's true.  And our view, 6 Justice Scalia, is that the case should begin and end at 7 the prima facie case requirement.  Our view is that the 8 plaintiffs did not make a prima facie case of invidious 9 discrimination in this case, and so the district court's 10 factual findings about the Commission's actual motives 11 actually aren't relevant at this point. 12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand that.  I 13 thought a prima facie case means if  if you haven't 14 made a prima facie case, it means you have to bring in 15 other evidence.  It doesn't mean you're out of court. 16             MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, if you haven't made 17 the prima facie case, it means that the State doesn't 18 have to justify its reasons for the deviations.  And so 19 in this context, in order to make  in really any 20 context, to make a prima facie case, what you have to do 21 is put in enough evidence from which an inference of 22 invidious discrimination can be made. 23             What that generally requires is that the 24 challenger has to put in enough in evidence to rebut the 25 presumed reasons for the challenged action.  In this
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
49 1 case the Arizona  Arizona constitution sets forth the 2 redistricting criteria that the Commission is to use in 3 drawing district lines, and so at a minimum the 4 plaintiffs should have come in and demonstrated that 5 the  that the deviations that they observed were not 6 explainable as in service of the  7             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let  let's assume 8 that the  the opinion of the district court found that 9 partisanship was a consideration. 10             So are you saying that that finding can't be 11 sustained because it wasn't based on sufficient evidence 12 brought forward by the plaintiffs? 13             MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, first, just a point 14 of clarification.  Part of the opinion that you read was 15 just talking about District 8, and so it wasn't defining 16 that partisanship played any role with respect to the 17 rest of the map.  And if you read on in the paragraph 18 from which you were quoting, the district court said 19 that the amount of deviation that was attributable to 20 the attempts to make the district more competitive was 21 less than 1 percent.  I think it was .7 percent. 22             And so it's really a small, very small  23             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, was it a factor or 24 not?  Was partisanship just irrelevant, that it played 25 no role, everything would have come out the same way 
Alderson Reporting Company

50 1             MS. HARRINGTON:  The district court found  2             JUSTICE ALITO:   without partisanship 3 according the district court's finding? 4             MS. HARRINGTON:  The district court found 5 that with respect to one district, two of the five 6 commissioners were motivated in part by  by 7 partisanship motives. 8             But, again, our  our first position is 9 that this Court doesn't need to get to what the actual 10 findings were as to the motives because what the 11 plaintiffs needed to do was come in and demonstrate at 12 the front end that the lines on the map couldn't be 13 explained as an effort to comply with legitimate 14 districting criteria. 15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If the  16             JUSTICE ALITO:  The district of  17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is the position 18 of the United States on the question of whether it's 19 permissible to intentionally take partisanship  to use 20 partisanship as a guiding principle in redistricting? 21 Is that permissible or not? 22             MS. HARRINGTON:  We haven't taken a position 23 on that that  24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I know you haven't. 25 It seems very unfortunate.  It's a little difficult for
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
51 1 us to address it since that's one of the main questions 2 in the case. 3             MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, the United States has 4 never participated in the political gerrymandering 5 cases.  It certainly  you know, there are lessons that 6 can be drawn from this Court's cases.  In Gaffney, the 7 Court indicated that certainly consideration of politics 8 and partisanship does not necessarily make a plan 9 unconstitutional. 10             But, again, in this case, I think in 11 order  before you even get to the question of what the 12 State's actual motives were, there has to be some 13 demonstration that the motives were not the announced 14 motives that are in the Arizona Constitution. 15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you're  you're 16 unwilling to tell me whether intentional use of 17 partisanship in redistricting is acceptable or not? 18             MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, I think this Court's 19 decision in Gaffney indicates that it can be 20 permissible.  The districting body in Gaffney was driven 21 by a desire to equalize partisanship  22             JUSTICE BREYER:  I took it that the position 23 of the United States is at least, since many commissions 24 are nonpartisan because they have two people who are 25 more partisan on one side, two people on the other side
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 and one neutral.  So at the least, where the

52

2 commissions  commissioners don't account for a

3 majority, the partisan motive is not held by a majority

4 of the commission, then it is constitutional 

5             MS. HARRINGTON:  That 

6             JUSTICE BREYER:   for some members of the

7 commission to take partisan considerations into account

8 where they're not a majority and where the result is

9 under 10 percent.

10             MS. HARRINGTON:  I think that was the

11 district court's conclusion.  Our position 

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  Is your conclusion as

13 representing the United States.

14             MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, again, we haven't

15 taken a position on how one would analyze a

16 partisanship  if there was a finding that you get

17 there, about a partisanship  partisanship motive.

18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. 

19             JUSTICE BREYER:  I read the finding as

20 saying, well, two members of the commission out of five

21 did have a partisan motive, in part.

22             MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  So I have to  you have

25 that situation, is constitutional or not.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
53 1             MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, no.  Let me make the 2 pitch one more time for the  for having a robust prima 3 facie case. 4             So the  what the Plaintiff needed to do 5 was come into this  come into court and say, here is a 6 map; it can't be explained by the criteria that are 7 identified in the Constitution that the Commission is 8 supposed to go by.  The very first criterion listed in 9 the Constitution is complying  includes compliance 10 with the Voting Rights Act. 11             If you look at the map and you look at 12 which  which districts were underpopulated and which 13 are the abilitytoelect districts, there's almost a 14 perfect correlation.  And I think  I think that was a 15 perfectly legitimate explanation for why there are 16 deviations in the case. 17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand this two 18 out of five.  Do you  do you think if four of the 19 justices of this Court voted a certain way in a case 20 because they were racists, the opinion would still be 21 valid because, after all, five of us weren't?  Would you 22 even consider that?  And why is it any different for a 23  for a commission like this?  The mere fact that two 24 of them are  if  if partisanship is indeed bad  25             MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, again, I think, you

If you're going to say 12 that no members of a redistricting commission can ever 13 have  can ever have partisan views, I don't know where 14 you're going to get your membership from. 15             (Laughter.) 16             JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean that  that is  17 that many of these commissions, I would think, would 18 balance people who know about districting and who are 19 also Republicans with people who know about it and are 20 also Democrats, and then you have someone of undoubted 21 neutral  22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is not the case here. 23 That places a lot of weight on selecting the fifth 24 person who is lily  lilywhite pure, right?

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There's a difference

19 between something's a necessary evil and saying it's

20 evil.

21             (Laughter.)

22             MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, I think this Court's

23 decisions have told us that it's  that it's fine to

24 have partisanship play some role in redistricting.

25 That's the  that's the lesson of Gaffney.

56 1             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I'm really surprised 2 with the way you  the way you read the district 3 court's opinion.  In footnote 10 of the district court's 4 opinion, they set out the standard that they apply. 5             MS. HARRINGTON:  Can you give me the page, 6 please? 7             JUSTICE ALITO:  It's on 62  I'm sorry  8 63a, running over into 64a.  And in the  the final 9 paragraph that begins at the bottom of the page, "For 10 decision purposes, a majority of the panel made up of 11 Judge Clifton and Judge Silver have concluded that 12 Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that partisanship 13 predominated over legitimate redistricting 14 considerations." 15             Doesn't that mean that they found that there 16 were some illegitimate considerations, or at least 17 they  and they assumed that partisanship was an 18 illegitimate consideration? 19             MS. HARRINGTON:  They say that on 79a, which 20 is where you were reading from earlier  21             JUSTICE ALITO:  No, no. 22             MS. HARRINGTON:   I think it's clear that 23 what they're talking about, that partisan  that 24 partisanship played a role only with respect to 25 District 8.

2 allows the plaintiffs to come in and just point to  to

3 deviations in districts 

4             JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm sorry.  Just to clarify

5 your answer.

6             So you think that what they said in

7 footnote 10 only applies to one district.

8             MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.  That's my reading of

9 the opinion.  I think  I haven't heard the other side

10 disagree with that, but you can ask them.

11             You know, if this Court makes it too easy

12 for plaintiffs to come in and point to deviations and

13 partisan correlations, then it's going to totally wipe

14 away the 10percent leeway, which itself serves

15 important districting principles.

16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,

17 Ms. Harrington.

18             General Hearne, you have four minutes

19 remaining.

20          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK F. HEARNE, II

21                ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

22             MR. HEARNE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about footnote 10?  Do

24 you agree with  with the characterization that the

25 other side has made?

Alderson Reporting Company

1             MR. HEARNE:  Well, footnote 10, no, I do

58

2 not.

3             And the portion I would quote was not

4 limited just to District 8.  Partisanship was rank in

5 this redistricting process, and is demonstrated

6 objectively, not just with Judge Wake's chart.  But it's

7 also demonstrated by the fact of District 8, which was

8 not submitted for preclearance.

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I want a finding.  I want a

10 finding.  I don't  I don't want to look at a chart 

11             MR. HEARNE:  Well 

12             JUSTICE SCALIA:   to make my own factual

13 determination.

14             What factual finding other than footnote 10

15 is there?

16             MR. HEARNE:  Then I would quote from the

17 Appendix at 107a, which is where the statement's made,

18 "Judge Clifton correctly finds that the IRC was actually

19 motivated by both partisan advantage and hope for voting

20 rights preclearance."

21             So we have a majority for that finding of

22 fact.

23             So that is two members of the court

24 specifically found that partisanship was one of the two

25 motives to explain these deviations from oneperson,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
59 1 onevote.  So clearly, it was a motive at that point, as 2 even Judge Silver noted, this is a mixedmotive case. 3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but to what extent?  I 4 mean, the other side's going to say, yes, that's true, 5 but it's only true as to that one district discussed in 6 footnote 10. 7             MR. HEARNE:  Well, if that's so, then they 8 would have stopped and adopted the initial map and not 9 continued to deviate from 4 percent to 8 percent for the 10 final map.  The initial map, the draft map, was a 11 4percent deviation. 12             Dr. King, their own expert, said that this 13 map complied with the Voting Rights Act.  And yet, they 14 went after that and continued deviating and 15 underpopulating districts to get to the 8.8 percent. 16 That included the machinations with District 8. 17             So if the only legitimate reason was to 18 obtain preclearance, then they would have accepted the 19 draft map, and it would have been game over.  But they 20 didn't.  They went ahead and conducted these 21 deviations  22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I thought it was because 23 they wanted to make super sure that they complied with 24 the Voting Act.  I think  I think that that's why they 25 said they kept going.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
60 1             MR. HEARNE:  The explanation that was made 2 is that they were, quote, "strengthening" these 3 districts by continuing to underpopulate districts 4 because their consultant said, oh, that does help us get 5 Voting Rights Act preclearance approval.  That was the 6 explanation made. 7             But if their own expert said the original 8 map, the draft map satisfied the Voting Rights Act, and 9 the only reason to additionally depopulate these 10 districts was to achieve a further partisan skew, which 11 Judge Wake's chart demonstrates, then that shows that 12 partisanship was a very  I understand two of the 13 members said that it was not the primary motive, but it 14 certainly was a pervasive motive in the process by which 15 these districts were drawn. 16             And our position is a very narrow one that 17 we ask the Court to hold, is that partisanship does not 18 justify deviating from oneperson, onevote, and that a 19 mistaken belief that preclearance was necessary to 20 underpopulate certain districts also does not justify 21 deviating from oneperson, onevote. 22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But where  where 23 is the district in which  or the State in which 24 partisanship does not play a role in redistricting? 25             MR. HEARNE:  Well, we think partisanship is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
61 1 always going to play a role.  We  we would say, but 2 there's an outer limit, as certainly  as  as 3 Justice Scalia noted, a articulateable, justiciable 4 standard of oneperson, onevote.  That's a rule that we 5 can cabin the partisanship. 6             You can be partisan.  And we don't fault the 7 Commission for having partisan interests, Republican 8 members, Democrat members.  Even if this fifth member 9 ended up being partisan interest for the Democrats, 10 that's fine.  The problem here isn't that they had 11 partisan motives.  It's that they deviated from the 12 oneperson, onevote principle to further those partisan 13 motives.  And that's what we  14             JUSTICE KAGAN:  If I could ask the  the 15 question that Ms. Harrington left with, was that  I'm 16 sorry. 17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, please.  Finish. 18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Even  if  if you're 19 saying that even within the 10 percent, you know, to go 20 from 1 percent to 2 percent, or from 2 percent to 21 3 percent, and then somebody can come in and say that's 22 partisanship, it means that every single plan will be up 23 for grabs in every single place, doesn't it? 24             MR. HEARNE:  I don't think it does.  And the 25 answer would be it doesn't, because in this case, there

62 1 were no other legitimate reasons to explain it.  If that 2 is the reason, and the only reason to deviate  only 3 other legitimate reason to deviate from  from 4 oneperson, onevote, then it is not a constitutional 5 plan.  But that's not present in all the other cases. 6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 7 The case is submitted. 8             (Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the
