 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 next in Number 02-311, Kevin Wiggins versus Sewall Smith.
 5 Mr. Verrilli.
 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.
 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 8 MR. VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 9 please the Court:
 10 Under the clearly established law of Strickland
 11 v. Washington, a lawyer's decision about how to defend a
 12 client facing a death sentence must be supported either by
 13 a thorough investigation or by a reasonable professional
 14 judgment supporting limitation on investigation.
 15 In this case, the Maryland Court of Appeals and 16 the Fourth Circuit applied that rule in an objectively
 17 unreasonable manner. Kevin Wiggins' lawyers did not
 18 fulfill what this Court described in Williams against
 19 Taylor as their obligation under Strickland to investigate
 20 thoroughly their client's background, and no reasonable
 21 professional judgment in fact supports or could support
 22 their failure to do so.
 23 QUESTION: Do you think the Williams case is a
 24 white horse for you, that is, I mean, that it's exactly
 25 identical to this case?

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. VERRILLI: I do not think it's exactly
 2 identical to this case, Your Honor, but we think it
 3 clearly informs this case both by explaining what an --
 4 what an objectively unreasonable application of Strickland
 5 amounts to and in emphasizing the critical importance of
 6 investigating a -- a -- your client's background as -- as
 7 a prerequisite to making informed, reasonable choices
 8 about how best to defend your client.
 9 QUESTION: But -- but wasn't Williams decided
 10 after the Maryland Supreme Court's opinion here?
 11 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, it was Justice Scalia,
 12 but --
 13 QUESTION: So, therefore, it can't be used for
 14 purposes of deciding whether what Maryland did was an
 15 unreasonable application of then-existing Federal law. 16 MR. VERRILLI: I disagree with that, Justice
 17 Scalia, for the following reason. Williams, like this
 18 case, was an AEDPA case and all Williams could do was
 19 decide whether Strickland had been unreasonably applied. 
 20 Williams was -- because Williams was an AEDPA case, was a
 21 2254(d)(1) case, Williams could break no new ground by
 22 definition, and therefore, the -- the fact that Williams
 23 concluded what it did about Strickland's requirement,
 24 means that that is what Strickland requires. And that --
 25 and -- and so we don't think it -- we're going beyond

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 AEDPA in the least.
 2 QUESTION: Yet, you go back to Strickland and
 3 you can't find the principle that you're now enunciating.
 4 MR. VERRILLI: Oh, no, no. I disagree with
 5 that, Mr. Chief Justice. We think it's right on page 690
 6 and 691 of -- of Strickland, and here's the principle that
 7 we think -- Strickland specifically says, as we read it,
 8 that a lawyer's judgment about how to defend a client has
 9 either got to be based on complete investigation or, if
 10 it's based on less than complete investigation, it's
 11 reasonable only to the extent that reasonable professional
 12 judgment supports the limitation on investigation. That's
 13 the rule.
 14 QUESTION: Last year in Bell -- Bell versus
 15 Cohen -- Cone, we stressed that it is a tremendously 16 deferential regard that we have to the lawyer's action in
 17 a case like that.
 18 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, but there's a fundamental
 19 difference between this case and Bell v. Cone, Mr. Chief
 20 Justice, and it's this. Bell v. Cone was not a case about
 21 the failure to investigate. That was purely a case about
 22 counsel's decisions about what information to present to
 23 the sentencer after having done what was indisputably a
 24 thorough investigation.
 25 And the reason that's critical is because as --

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 as we read Strickland, the whole point of the deference
 2 given to counsel's choices about what to present is
 3 premised on the adequacy of the investigation that
 4 precedes them. That is what the source of the deferential
 5 stance towards presentation is. It's the adequacy of
 6 investigation.
 7 QUESTION: Is that what this case is about,
 8 Mr. Verrilli, about failure to investigate?
 9 MR. VERRILLI: This case is about both, but it's
 10 principally about --
 11 QUESTION: It would seem to me if it were, you
 12 would have to establish pretty clearly that counsel did
 13 not know these many things that you say he did not know. 
 14 And in fact, counsel was never asked the question, did you
 15 know this, did you know that, did you know -- we don't 16 know what counsel --
 17 I -- I'm looking at the joint appendix on
 18 page 490. He knew a lot of these things. He's -- he's --
 19 he's asked did you know that Wiggins had been removed from
 20 his natural mother as a result of a finding of neglect and
 21 abuse when he was 6 years old? Yes, he says, I knew that. 
 22 That was in the social service records. So you knew it. 
 23 Yes.
 24 You also knew that there were reports of sexual
 25 abuse at one of the foster homes. Yes, he knew that.

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 You also knew he had his hands burned as a child
 2 as a result of his mother's abuse of him. Yes, he knew
 3 that.
 4 You also knew about homosexual overtures made
 5 towards him by his Job Corps supervisor. Yes.
 6 And you also knew he was -- he was borderline
 7 mentally retarded. Yes.
 8 Now, that -- that examination could have --
 9 could have gone further, but you didn't know, did you,
 10 this, this, this, this, and this. There's no examination
 11 like that. We know that he knew many things about this
 12 person's background, but we don't know that he didn't know
 13 the rest of it.
 14 MR. VERRILLI: I disagree with that, Justice
 15 Scalia.
 16 QUESTION: Well, how do we know that he didn't
 17 know it?
 18 MR. VERRILLI: Well, here's how. There -- there
 19 are two absolutely compelling reasons, but before I get to
 20 them, I think it's important to look at the very next
 21 thing that the lawyer says in that colloquy. And the very
 22 next thing the lawyer says is, well, yes, at least I knew
 23 what was reported in other people's reports. And that is
 24 what led the Maryland Court of Appeals to the conclusion
 25 it reached, which was that the social service records and

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 the pre-sentence records, other people's reports,
 2 contained that information, and we have shown by clear and
 3 convincing evidence that they do not.
 4 But there are two additional points that are
 5 critical here, and the first one is this. The trier of
 6 fact, the actual judge who heard that testimony --
 7 QUESTION: I -- I have to correct you. That --
 8 he -- he didn't say that all of this that he knew he only
 9 knew because it was in other people's reports. The
 10 question was -- he had just said -- and you also knew that
 11 he was borderline mentally retarded. Yes.
 12 He -- then another question is begun. You knew
 13 all -- he interrupts the question and he says, at least I
 14 knew that as it was reported in other people's reports,
 15 yes. 
 The that was the fact that he was borderline 16 mentally retarded.
 17 MR. VERRILLI: Justice Scalia, that is not how
 18 the --
 19 QUESTION: That's how it reads.
 20 MR. VERRILLI: -- Maryland Court of Appeals read
 21 it. It is not how the Fourth Circuit read it.
 22 QUESTION: The court of appeals and the Fourth
 23 Circuit must have read it wrong because that's the way it
 24 reads.
 25 MR. VERRILLI: But -- but, Justice Scalia, what

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 matters here for AEDPA purposes under (d)(2) is whether
 2 the court of appeals based its determination on an
 3 unreasonable factual finding, and there are two -- there
 4 are two critical indicia here that it did. The first
 5 one -- the first one is this. Well, there are three.
 6 First, the records don't contain the
 7 information.
 8 Second, the trier of fact, the judge who heard
 9 this testimony, concluded -- and this is at page 605 and
 10 606 of the joint appendix -- that Mr. Schlaich, the lawyer
 11 who gave that testimony, did not know what was in the
 12 social -- what was in the social history subsequently
 13 prepared.
 14 QUESTION: This was in the trial itself or in a
 15 State habeas proceeding?
 16 MR. VERRILLI: In the State habeas proceeding,
 17 Your Honor. His -- at the conclusion of his testimony and
 18 during closing argument by the -- by the government in
 19 that State habeas proceeding, the -- the trier of fact who
 20 heard the testimony, could assess demeanor, could assess
 21 credibility, heard all the other evidence, saw all the
 22 other evidence, concluded that he didn't know and found it
 23 was error.
 24 And then -- and the next point that we think
 25 conclusively demonstrates that -- that the lawyers did not

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 know is this. Remember that -- that at the close of the
 2 sentencing proceeding, not the post-conviction proceeding,
 3 Mr. Chief Justice, but the actual sentencing proceeding,
 4 counsel for Wiggins made a proffer of what mitigating
 5 evidence they would have submitted to the sentencing jury
 6 had their motion to bifurcate been granted. That proffer
 7 doesn't mention any of the mitigating evidence that --
 8 that we have shown in the social history -- doesn't
 9 mention the terrible abuse of the first 6 years of his
 10 life. It doesn't mention the horrible burning incident. 
 11 It doesn't mention the sexual abuse. It doesn't mention
 12 the homelessness. There's no conceivable reason why
 13 counsel would have withheld all of that information from
 14 its proffer at the conclusion of the sentencing phase of
 15 the proceeding if counsel knew that and could -16 QUESTION: So that counsel referred to other
 17 people's reports and other reports. Can we draw any
 18 inference from the record that there were some reports
 19 other than the -- I take it it's the social -- social
 20 services report?
 21 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think there was --
 22 QUESTION: And the pre-sentence and social --
 23 MR. VERRILLI: Pre-sentence.
 24 QUESTION: -- and social services? Were there
 25 any other documents that --

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. VERRILLI: The -- there is a document which
 2 the State has lodged which indicates that there were
 3 transcripts of interviews with family members. Those
 4 aren't in the record, but I think the same exact analysis,
 5 the same exact inference has to be drawn. If those had
 6 included the kind of terrible descriptions of -- of abuse,
 7 it would have shown up in the psychologist's report
 8 because, after all, what that document shows is the
 9 psychologist got those interviews and it would have shown
 10 up in the proffer because that is the most --
 11 QUESTION: And -- and the psychologist's is the
 12 social -- social services report.
 13 MR. VERRILLI: No. That's separate --
 14 QUESTION: That's a separate report.
 15 MR. VERRILLI: 
 That's a separate -16 QUESTION: That's exactly my -- look, there is a
 17 document here called lodging and it says, Baltimore City
 18 Department of Social Services Department File. Now, in
 19 looking through it briefly, I cannot find in it all the
 20 references that you say are not in it.
 21 MR. VERRILLI: They are --
 22 QUESTION: I don't think they're there.
 23 MR. VERRILLI: They are not there.
 24 QUESTION: But this says, other people's
 25 reports, and I'm perhaps going to hear in about 20 minutes

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 from now that there could be other reports to which he was
 2 referring which are not in this document and which might
 3 be those other -- those other interviews with other
 4 people, et cetera. In other words, I don't want you to
 5 sit down -- it's -- it's one thing if I'm supposed to look
 6 at this document and say did this lawyer investigate the
 7 background, and the answer I think would be no. But it's
 8 quite another thing if he knew all kinds of other things
 9 from other sources, namely about the burned hands, all the
 10 things you've listed. So I want to be sure.
 11 Now, you're referring me one other thing, the
 12 proffer. But in respect to the proffer, since I've read
 13 the briefs, I suspect I will hear the following. Of
 14 course, he didn't want to proffer this. His strategic
 15 decision was to make the jury think that this man might 16 not have done it, and the more lunatic we make him sound,
 17 the more the jury is going to think the opposite.
 18 MR. VERRILLI: Justice Breyer, let me -- let
 19 me --
 20 QUESTION: Or I suspect I'll hear that because
 21 I've read it.
 22 MR. VERRILLI: Let me address --
 23 QUESTION: So I would like you --
 24 MR. VERRILLI: Let me address that directly
 25 because I think this goes the essence of why the Maryland

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Court of Appeals judgment was an unreasonable application
 2 of -- of the Strickland rule, and it's this.
 3 The proffer occurred in the following context. 
 4 Counsel for Wiggins made a motion to bifurcate the
 5 sentencing proceeding so that they could first retry the
 6 factual case of eligibility, and then if they lost, they
 7 could then put on the full-blown mitigation case.
 8 QUESTION: That would have involved the
 9 principal issue had they -- as a separate --
 10 MR. VERRILLI: Right. Bifurcation would have
 11 first involved the principalship, and then had
 12 principalship been established to the jury's satisfaction,
 13 they would have moved to the issue of mitigation. And
 14 the -- and the trial judge denied that motion. Now, he
 15 denied that motion -- this is critical -- on the first day 16 of the sentencing hearing. So up to the first day of the
 17 sentencing hearing, Kevin Wiggins' lawyer's strategy was
 18 obviously to prepare both a principalship case and a
 19 mitigation case because they made a motion that was
 20 designed to allow them to do precisely that. So there is
 21 no conceivable justification for them to have failed to do
 22 everything a reasonable lawyer would have done to develop
 23 a mitigation case.
 24 And they -- and what the proffer shows -- I'm
 25 afraid the proffer cannot, Justice Breyer, be explained on

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 the basis that Your Honor described for this reason. The
 2 point of the proffer -- the point of the proffer was to
 3 show the judge and to create a record on appeal of what
 4 they would have shown had the bifurcation been granted and
 5 they could have tried their mitigation case. This proffer
 6 was their mitigation case.
 7 QUESTION: What about the first part which was
 8 Justice Kennedy's part, I think so far all of our parts --
 9 questions, which is when you read just the part that
 10 Justice Scalia read to you -- and he says it's on the
 11 basis of other people's reports -- will the other side
 12 concede or how do we know it's -- what he's referring to
 13 is this document rather than some other set of documents?
 14 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think what's critical in
 15 that regard is what the Maryland Court of Appeals found 16 because what AEDPA requires deference to is factual
 17 findings made by a State court. And what the -- and the
 18 factual finding that the Maryland Court of Appeals
 19 found -- made is on page 121 of the appendix to the
 20 petition in the -- in the second paragraph there. It --
 21 it says, counsel was indeed aware of Wiggins' unfortunate
 22 background. They had available to them not only the
 23 pre-sentence investigation, but detailed social service
 24 records documenting sexual abuse and physical abuse.
 25 That is the sum and substance, the total, of

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 what the Maryland Court of Appeals said in terms of the
 2 facts here. It's the sole factual finding. That factual
 3 finding --
 4 QUESTION: Did it say, and nothing else? Did it
 5 say, and nothing else?
 6 MR. VERRILLI: It said --
 7 QUESTION: You're -- you're making it as though
 8 it was a factual finding that this is all that he knew. 
 9 Now, they knew that he knew that, but they didn't make a
 10 factual finding that he didn't know anything else.
 11 MR. VERRILLI: They -- the factual -- the only
 12 factual finding they made -- the only -- the only -- the
 13 only thing that supports and explicates the general
 14 statement at the outset of that paragraph that they were
 15 aware of his unfortunate childhood is the specific factual 16 finding that the social service records documented sexual
 17 abuse and documented physical abuse. We've shown by clear
 18 and convincing evidence that that finding is wrong.
 19 And then under (d)(2) in AEDPA the question is
 20 whether the Maryland Court of Appeals' judgment was -- was
 21 based on an -- an unreasonable factual determination. And
 22 we've shown that the only thing that they found --
 23 QUESTION: Mr. Verrilli, I'd like to come back
 24 to the habeas -- the State habeas decision that you --
 25 that you cited us to, which is on the joint appendix

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 page 604. Now, as I understand it, if you're making a
 2 claim of failure to investigate, the burden is on you to
 3 show that counsel did not know things that he would have
 4 learned on investigation. The burden is on you.
 5 As I read this court's decision, what the court
 6 is simply saying is, I don't ever remember a death penalty
 7 case where there was not a social history done. And so it
 8 was simply unthinkable not to have a social history.
 9 Then when you go across the page, so, therefore,
 10 based upon the evidence that I have seen, I'm concluding
 11 it was error for them not to investigate it because I
 12 don't have any information before me to believe that they
 13 did not have this information available to them.
 14 You see the context? And I understand what
 15 you're saying, but the context of this case is that I have 16 no reason to believe that they did have all of this
 17 information. That's not -- that's not enough to satisfy
 18 your burden. That court would have had to find I believe
 19 that they did not have this information, not I just have
 20 no reason to believe that they had it.
 21 MR. VERRILLI: But --
 22 QUESTION: The court should have had to find
 23 they did not have this information. It doesn't find that. 
 24 It just says I have no reason to believe that they had it.
 25 MR. VERRILLI: Justice Scalia, I disagree. I do

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 not think that is a reasonable reading of what the trial
 2 judge held. What the trial --
 3 QUESTION: You -- you tell me what it means. It
 4 says --
 5 MR. VERRILLI: The trial --
 6 QUESTION: -- I have no reason to believe that
 7 they did have all of this information.
 8 MR. VERRILLI: The trial judge said that he was
 9 concluding that it was error not to investigate. If they
 10 knew the information, it wouldn't have been error not to
 11 investigate and --
 12 QUESTION: No. Earlier the -- the trial judge
 13 says, I just don't think -- I -- I don't know any
 14 capital --
 15 MR. VERRILLI: 
 With all due respect, Justice 16 Scalia --
 17 QUESTION: -- I don't know any capital case in
 18 which a social history wasn't done.
 19 MR. VERRILLI: With all due respect --
 20 QUESTION: I think he -- I think he reversed
 21 simply because you're always supposed to do a social
 22 history.
 23 MR. VERRILLI: With all due respect, Your Honor,
 24 the very sentence that you pointed to said, based on the
 25 evidence that I have seen, I'm concluding it was error for

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 them not to investigate it. If they knew the information,
 2 he never would have reached that conclusion.
 3 QUESTION: No. He reached the conclusion
 4 because --
 5 MR. VERRILLI: And that's completely supported
 6 by the proffer.
 7 QUESTION: He reached the conclusion because
 8 he --
 9 QUESTION: No two voices at the same time. 
 10 Justice Scalia is asking you a question.
 11 MR. VERRILLI: Excuse me.
 12 QUESTION: He reached the conclusion because he
 13 said, I have no reason to believe that they had the
 14 information. He never made the finding that they didn't
 15 have it.
 16 MR. VERRILLI: I think that's implicit, Justice
 17 Scalia, in his conclusion that it was error not to
 18 investigate, and I think it's completely confirmed by the
 19 proffer which didn't include any of this information and
 20 for which there would have been absolutely no explanation
 21 for its exclusion. Absolutely none whatsoever. So I
 22 think with respect to the -- to the factual finding that
 23 the Maryland Court of Appeals made, that the social
 24 services records documented abuse and provided the source
 25 of his knowledge, that's clearly erroneous.

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Mr. Verrilli, you said absolutely no
 2 reason why it wouldn't come in if they had it. Why
 3 couldn't counsel for the defense think if we introduce
 4 this, it's going to be subject to cross examination? And
 5 if we look at that social history, we find out that the
 6 whole thing is -- the defendant himself was the source of
 7 the information about the horrible sexual abuse he had
 8 been exposed to as a child. The jury might find that a
 9 person who had been so abused would be full of hate and
 10 therefore very likely would have had the mental state to
 11 carry out this brutal murder that -- in other words, that
 12 this kind of information could be a two-edged sword. The
 13 jury could infer from it he's not fully responsible for
 14 his acts or, on the other hand, that this person was
 15 violent, full of hate, and indeed committed this brutal 16 murder.
 17 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think, Your Honor, I'm
 18 going to answer Your Honor's question directly, but I -- I
 19 need a minute to do it.
 20 QUESTION: Yes.
 21 MR. VERRILLI: The question under Strickland, it
 22 seems to us, is that once you've concluded that there was
 23 a failure to investigate adequately, the question is
 24 whether there is a reasonable probability that the outcome
 25 would have been different as a result of that failure. 

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 And in this case, it seems to me, that means that what
 2 we -- and Strickland also stresses that that is an
 3 objective test. That is not based on the idiosyncracies
 4 of the individual decision makers. It's an objective
 5 analysis.
 6 And so the question here is whether had this
 7 information been investigated, if it was in the hands of
 8 competent counsel, is there a reasonable probability that
 9 competent counsel would have used it and introduced it,
 10 and then is there a reasonable probability that it would
 11 have affected the sentencing jury's outcome.
 12 And the second half of that analysis, it seems
 13 to us, is answered a fortiori by Williams against Taylor.
 14 The first half of that analysis seems to us
 15 clearly to support relief here because, as I take Your 16 Honor's question, it's a question of, well, there might be
 17 a justification for not submitting this evidence to the
 18 jury. Yes, there might. We think in a case like this
 19 one, it would be an unreasonable choice not to do so
 20 because this evidence has so little of what this Court has
 21 described in other cases like Burger and Darden as a sharp
 22 double edge, and it is so powerfully mitigating that we
 23 don't think it would have that effect.
 24 But we -- we respectfully suggest that's not the
 25 relevant question. Once you've established deficient

20

1 performance with respect to investigation, then we shift
 2 to the prejudice inquiry, and it's an objective analysis. 
 3 And so long as there is a reasonable probability that
 4 competent counsel would have used this information in
 5 combination with the case that they made, then -- and
 6 there's a reasonable probability that the outcome would
 7 have been affected, which I think Williams v. Taylor
 8 establishes for us, then we have shown what we need to
 9 show to be entitled to relief.
 10 QUESTION: Do you --
 11 QUESTION: What are the --
 12 QUESTION: What do you think the test is that
 13 Williams against Taylor lays down as to determining a -- a
 14 probability of a different outcome?
 15 MR. VERRILLI: 
 Well, I think, if I may just draw 16 from Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion with respect to
 17 that. If there's an obvious failure on the part of the
 18 State court to consider the totality of the record, that's
 19 an unreasonable application with respect to prejudice. 
 20 And with -- in Williams, of course, as Your Honor's
 21 dissenting opinion pointed out, there was a much more
 22 severe case of aggravating information than here. 
 23 Williams had a terrible, long record of violence. Wiggins
 24 has none. And the mitigating evidence here is even
 25 stronger than the mitigating evidence that existed in the

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Williams case.
 2 And so we think it follows directly from
 3 Williams that -- that if you look at whether there's a
 4 reasonable probability that the outcome would have been
 5 different here on the basis of submitting this evidence,
 6 that we think that's a very clear and easy case under the
 7 standards that Williams sets.
 8 QUESTION: Are -- are you making any argument
 9 that the ruling on the bifurcation motion might also have
 10 been different if there had been a proffer of this? Or
 11 did the judge rule on the bifurcation motion without
 12 knowing what the mitigation evidence might be?
 13 MR. VERRILLI: The -- factually, Justice
 14 Kennedy, it's the latter. The -- he ruled on the
 15 bifurcation motion at the outset of the -- of the trial. 16 QUESTION: Is -- is that a common motion in
 17 Maryland capital cases, to try to bifurcate the sentencing
 18 proceeding?
 19 MR. VERRILLI: At the time it was, and the
 20 reason it was, Mr. Chief Justice, is because sometime
 21 shortly before this case was tried in Baltimore County,
 22 another Baltimore County judge had allowed such a motion.
 23 And we think that fact reinforces the utterly
 24 unreasonable character of the failure to investigate here. 
 25 These lawyers had a -- had -- had to think there was a

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 reasonable prospect they were going to be able to put on a
 2 mitigation case, but we know that all they had to put on
 3 that mitigation case was the psychologist's testing. And
 4 after all, that -- all that psychologist did was test.
 5 QUESTION: But they would -- they would be
 6 fighting over the principalship too, would they not?
 7 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, but that -- the point of
 8 bifurcation was to do principalship first, and if they
 9 prevailed on principalship, they wouldn't go to the second
 10 phase. And only if they didn't prevail on principalship
 11 would they go to the second phase where they wouldn't have
 12 any of the tactical cross currents they were worried about
 13 because principalship was already established and they
 14 could go whole hog and make the fullest mitigation case
 15 possible.
 16 And the fact that they were -- that they were
 17 endeavoring to follow that strategy until the first day of
 18 the sentencing hearing, October 11th, 1989, shows that
 19 they didn't -- that all they had as of October 11, 1989,
 20 was the psychologist's report -- shows that they did not
 21 investigate at the level that Strickland requires.
 22 QUESTION: Mr. --
 23 QUESTION: What about the psychological reports,
 24 Mr. Verrilli? Those were available to defense counsel?
 25 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice O'Connor.

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: And indeed, obtained by defense
 2 counsel.
 3 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice O'Connor.
 4 QUESTION: And what did they reveal in this area
 5 of mitigation?
 6 MR. VERRILLI: They were -- the -- the -- there
 7 are two things that are important about the psychologist's
 8 report: one, what it does contain; the other, what it
 9 doesn't contain.
 10 The psychologist was commissioned in this case
 11 to do testing of Mr. Wiggins, intelligence testing and
 12 then psychological profiling, MMPI-type testing. The
 13 evidence is undisputed about that. That's what the
 14 psychologist did.
 15 The thing that's significant about what was 16 discovered was the fact that Mr. Wiggins was of borderline
 17 intelligence, which seems to us quite relevant and
 18 entirely consistent -- it would have been entirely
 19 consistent, even absent bifurcation, to use that evidence,
 20 in addition to an effort to disprove principalship,
 21 because the borderline intelligence would easily and
 22 strongly have supported the conclusion that Mr. Wiggins
 23 was an accomplice and not a principal.
 24 But the thing it doesn't show is any of the
 25 history of abuse, and that's because the psychologist

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 wasn't commissioned to do that. They didn't do what they
 2 needed to do here, which was to do the social history. 
 3 The evidence is clear that it was routine practice in
 4 these public defenders' office to do the social history. 
 5 They admitted that. The evidence is clear -- and the --
 6 and the public defenders admitted it -- that funds were
 7 available for that purpose. They just didn't do it. They
 8 just dropped the ball on this. They didn't do what all
 9 the lawyers in their office did routinely, and they didn't
 10 do what the State post-conviction trial judge said he had
 11 never seen not done, which is prepare this social history
 12 and --
 13 QUESTION: Mr. Verrilli, is -- is there any
 14 evidence, one way or the other, as to whether defense
 15 counsel simply sat down with the defendant and said, tell 16 us about your background and what has happened to you in
 17 your life? Is there any evidence one way or the other
 18 about that?
 19 MR. VERRILLI: There is not. There is not, but
 20 it wouldn't be a surprise, Justice Souter, that even if an
 21 interview like that occurred, that the defendant would not
 22 have revealed it, that -- it's very difficult to get this
 23 kind of history of horrible personal abuse out of a
 24 defendant. It very often requires a professional to do
 25 it. That is why -- that's the very reason why the social

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 workers are brought in to do the kinds of social histories
 2 as a -- as a routine matter. And it wasn't done here.
 3 If there are no further questions, I'd like to
 4 reserve my remaining time.
 5 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Verrilli.
 6 Mr. Bair.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY E. BAIR
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
 9 MR. BAIR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
 10 the Court:
 11 I'd like to first start with a correction in the
 12 factual record in this case. Counsel for petitioner
 13 has -- has referred the Court to JA605 and 606. And
 14 indeed, that was a comment made by the post-conviction
 15 court during the State post-conviction proceedings. 16 However, that was an oral comment from the bench in April
 17 of 1994.
 18 The post-conviction court's written opinion did
 19 not issue until 1997. And in the post-conviction written
 20 opinion -- it was a 257-page written opinion. And that
 21 written opinion basically countermanded and superseded and
 22 disavowed the statements that are on page JA605 and 606. 
 23 If you look to page 137a of the appendix to the petition
 24 for writ of certiorari, that is where you have the
 25 excerpts from --

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: What page? What --
 2 MR. BAIR: 137a, Your Honor. That is where
 3 you have the excerpt from the State habeas, State
 4 post-conviction court's written opinion. And if you look
 5 at footnote 261 on that page --
 6 QUESTION: These are footnotes in the State
 7 court's opinion or footnotes in the -- in the appendix?
 8 MR. BAIR: This is in -- these are footnotes in
 9 the State post-conviction court's opinion. It was, as I
 10 said, a very lengthy opinion and had several hundred
 11 footnotes as well as 257 pages.
 12 By the time the post-conviction court rendered
 13 its final decision, its written decision, it had the
 14 transcripts from the post-conviction proceeding. And --
 15 and as you may recall, the post-conviction proceeding 16 lasted 5 months. Testimony was taken over 7 days in a
 17 5-month post-conviction hearing.
 18 That footnote 261 is the transcript that Justice
 19 Scalia was referring to which is on JA490 and 491. So
 20 this is the testimony that the post-conviction court used
 21 to make its fact finding. And in its fact finding it said
 22 Schlaich had more information than appeared in the PSI
 23 report.
 24 I would go back to what was said earlier. There
 25 were several sources of the information for trial counsel. 

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 In fact, I would -- I would tally them up to be six
 2 different sources. You had, obviously, the DSS reports,
 3 the lodged material that Justice Breyer referred to,
 4 220 pages of social background, educational background,
 5 medical background, because petitioner was in foster care
 6 from when he was about 6 years old to when he --
 7 QUESTION: Let me just get one thing straight on
 8 the -- the long footnote that you quote. They end up
 9 saying, you knew all this and you did not get a social
 10 history. Do you think it was -- a competent counsel would
 11 have gotten a social history or not knowing what he said
 12 he knew?
 13 MR. BAIR: I think he got a -- he -- he got a
 14 social history in a different way, Your Honor. He didn't
 15 hire a forensic social worker. 
 Instead, he obtained 16 lengthy DSS reports, hired a psychologist, hired a
 17 criminologist, talked to family members, talked to the
 18 client. He didn't do it in the way that -- that counsel
 19 now says it should have been done.
 20 QUESTION: Is -- is the way that counsel says it
 21 should have been done the way that lawyers typically do it
 22 in -- in Maryland?
 23 MR. BAIR: I think they do it in different ways,
 24 Your Honor. I think -- I think sometimes they use
 25 forensic social workers. Sometimes they use

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 psychologists.
 2 QUESTION: But they're wrong to tell us that
 3 they normally use social workers. Is that right?
 4 MR. BAIR: I think --
 5 QUESTION: That was -- his representation was
 6 that this case is unique because every other member of the
 7 defense bar routinely gets the social history. Are you --
 8 is that right or wrong?
 9 MR. BAIR: I think it's wrong. I think it's
 10 wrong, Your Honor. I think that lawyers in Maryland use
 11 psychiatrists, they use psychologists, they use social
 12 workers, they use combinations thereof.
 13 QUESTION: But he didn't use any of these.
 14 MR. BAIR: Pardon me?
 15 QUESTION: 
 He didn't use any of those. 16 MR. BAIR: He -- he used a psychologist and he
 17 used a criminologist. And he obtained very lengthy DSS
 18 records.
 19 QUESTION: If -- the DSS records that he
 20 obtained -- are they all in the lodging or there are some
 21 other ones?
 22 MR. BAIR: Yes. They're all -- they're all in
 23 the lodging.
 24 QUESTION: Okay. Now, if -- if -- it's
 25 5 months -- it took 5 months. They went into this in

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 great care. You've given us the lodging. I've looked
 2 through the lodging, my law clerk more thoroughly. I
 3 can't find a word about the sexual abuse. I can't find a
 4 word about the frightful things that he -- one I did find
 5 where it said for -- when he was taken from his mother
 6 at age 6, it's true that the mother hadn't fed him for
 7 2 days. All right. That's there, but none of this other
 8 stuff is there.
 9 And -- and, indeed, if he looked at any of it --
 10 anywhere for this other stuff, where would he have looked? 
 11 Why wasn't that in the record which took 5 months, if in
 12 fact he looked? Why was there no more reference to it
 13 than an ambiguous statement where he seems to refer to the
 14 lodging?
 15 MR. BAIR: 
 Your Honor, a couple of -- a couple 16 of points to be made.
 17 First of all, I -- I agree, and I think we state
 18 in our brief, there is no specific reference to sexual
 19 abuse in those -- in -- in the lodging.
 20 QUESTION: And that's actually -- to me that's
 21 the most serious thing there is, I mean, in terms of
 22 shaping an individual who could later turn out the way
 23 that some have turned out. And -- and there is -- it was
 24 horrible in this case, and -- and there's absolutely no
 25 reference whatsoever that I can find that suggests that

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 this lawyer even knew about it.
 2 MR. BAIR: Well, there is, Your Honor. That --
 3 that goes back to JA490 and 491.
 4 QUESTION: He said he knew about it.
 5 MR. BAIR: But the lawyer explicitly testified
 6 that he knew of it.
 7 QUESTION: And what was -- that's why I want to
 8 know since -- since that statement, the two pages out of
 9 5 months, when I read them -- people can characterize them
 10 differently, but it seemed to me ambiguous, and the
 11 written reports could have easily referred to what I call
 12 the lodging. But if they didn't refer to the lodging,
 13 what did they refer to?
 14 MR. BAIR: The written reports and -- and I
 15 think the reports of others could be either written 16 reports or oral reports. I think --
 17 QUESTION: What he said was -- what did he say? 
 18 He said, in other people's reports. Yes, they could have
 19 been. So I would like to know. There's been 5 months of
 20 trial, as you said. There have been endless proceedings. 
 21 In your opinion, what did they refer to if, in fact, they
 22 did not refer to the lodging? Because if they did refer
 23 to the lodging, the lawyer in those two pages out of the
 24 5 months simply made a mistake, repeating what he knew
 25 later and thinking that he had learned it earlier from the

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 lodging.
 2 MR. BAIR: Your Honor, again, two -- two points
 3 to be made. One is if there is any ambiguity or any lack
 4 of a record here, I think under Strickland that inures to
 5 the detriment of petitioner. He had the burden at this
 6 hearing to rebut the -- the strong presumption of
 7 competence, the strong presumption of reasonable conduct.
 8 But let me go back to what the reports were. 
 9 You had reports from the client. And I think, although,
 10 as -- as was asked earlier by Justice Souter, there's
 11 nothing in the record to say whether he spoke to his
 12 client. I think we can infer that he spoke to his client. 
 13 He represented him for close to a year. Counsel for
 14 petitioner at post-conviction never pursued those lines of
 15 questioning. 
 So I think we can assume that this lawyer 16 talked to his client.
 17 QUESTION: The -- the post-conviction proceeding
 18 extended over a period of 5 months. How many trial days
 19 were there?
 20 MR. BAIR: There were 7 days, Your Honor, where
 21 testimony was taken in those 5 months --
 22 QUESTION: So it had recessed and then
 23 resumed --
 24 MR. BAIR: Yes.
 25 QUESTION: -- several times.

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BAIR: Yes, several times. It was --
 2 QUESTION: Mr. Bair, you -- you seem to accept
 3 that -- that all that he knew was as it was reported in
 4 other people's reports. But I just don't read the text
 5 that way. He said, at least I knew that as it was
 6 reported in other people's reports. And the that in that
 7 transcript is that he was borderline mentally retarded.
 8 MR. BAIR: I agree.
 9 QUESTION: That is the only thing that he said
 10 he got from other people's reports.
 11 MR. BAIR: I agree. I think --
 12 QUESTION: We don't know where he got all of the
 13 other information that he said he had.
 14 MR. BAIR: No, but I think logically, going back
 15 to the reports of sexual abuse, there's only one person 16 that could have come from because even the Selvog report,
 17 which is what post-conviction counsel prepared -- Selvog
 18 testified at the post-conviction hearing that his sole
 19 source for the information about Wiggins' sexual abuse was
 20 from Wiggins himself.
 21 Now, Wiggins obviously spoke to his attorney. 
 22 He spoke to the psychologist who interviewed him. He
 23 spoke to the criminologist that trial counsel hired. 
 24 Clearly, I think an inference can be drawn that Wiggins
 25 reported that sexual abuse either directly to his attorney

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 or to the criminologist or to the psychologist.
 2 QUESTION: And in your view on page 137a of the
 3 transcript, all of those matters are comprehended in this
 4 question and this answer toward maybe -- 10 lines from the
 5 top. You also knew that there were reports of sexual
 6 abuse at one of his foster homes? Yes.
 7 MR. BAIR: Yes.
 8 QUESTION: So the term -- the word reports there
 9 means that he relied on things other than that are in the
 10 lodging.
 11 MR. BAIR: Yes, I think so, Your Honor.
 12 QUESTION: To your knowledge -- and this is
 13 quite important to me. I'm just trying to find out what
 14 the -- if they were not referring to the lodging which
 15 contains the reports, if they were not referring to that 16 document, they must have been referring to or they were
 17 referring to Wiggins' own statements.
 18 MR. BAIR: Either Wiggins' own statements or the
 19 reports of the other experts in the case.
 20 QUESTION: Other experts in the case.
 21 MR. BAIR: Right. There was --
 22 QUESTION: He would have gotten them from?
 23 MR. BAIR: From Wiggins.
 24 QUESTION: After the trial was over.
 25 MR. BAIR: No, no, Your Honor.

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Before, before.
 2 MR. BAIR: This was all going on --
 3 QUESTION: That's the criminologist and the --
 4 MR. BAIR: Yes, yes. And those reports were
 5 prepared before trial or between trial and sentencing.
 6 There was a 2-and-a-half month postponement between the
 7 time of this trial and the time of the sentencing.
 8 QUESTION: All right. So the words, other
 9 people's reports, could have meant Wiggins told me or an
 10 expert whom I hired who talked to Wiggins told me.
 11 MR. BAIR: Yes.
 12 QUESTION: Yes, okay.
 13 MR. BAIR: Or I guess the only -- the only
 14 other --
 15 QUESTION: 
 That -- that he was mentally 16 retarded. It only goes to whether he was mentally
 17 retarded.
 18 MR. BAIR: Yes.
 19 QUESTION: I'm puzzled about another thing.
 20 MR. BAIR: The only other --
 21 QUESTION: Do those reports refer to sexual
 22 abuse?
 23 MR. BAIR: Pardon me, Your Honor?
 24 QUESTION: Do those reports refer to sexual
 25 abuse?

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BAIR: The only report that refers to sexual
 2 abuse -- now, the only written report that refers to
 3 sexual abuse is the Selvog report.
 4 QUESTION: The what?
 5 MR. BAIR: The -- the Selvog report was the one
 6 done by the social worker during post-conviction by -- by
 7 post-conviction counsel.
 8 The psychologist's report was an oral report. 
 9 So we don't really know exactly what he knew because
 10 there -- that was never reduced to writing.
 11 QUESTION: Well, I'm still puzzled. Were there
 12 any written reports available to the lawyer that referred
 13 to sexual abuse that we know about?
 14 MR. BAIR: No.
 15 QUESTION: 
 So then when he said you know that 16 there were reports of sexual abuse at one of his foster
 17 homes, he was wrong.
 18 MR. BAIR: No. I think he -- he was referring
 19 to -- he could have been referring to reports of Wiggins
 20 himself.
 21 QUESTION: Oh, oh. I see what you're saying --
 22 QUESTION: Oral reports.
 23 MR. BAIR: Oral reports.
 24 QUESTION: That -- that word reports does not
 25 mean written reports.

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BAIR: I don't think it has to refer to
 2 written reports, Your Honor.
 3 The only -- just to follow up with Justice
 4 Breyer, the only other report was the pre-sentence
 5 investigation. That was the other written report that was
 6 available to counsel.
 7 QUESTION: But that didn't have --
 8 MR. BAIR: No, no, no.
 9 QUESTION: I mean, what's worrying me obviously
 10 is we're -- we're turning an awful lot here on this word,
 11 other reports, which came in a fairly long hearing and
 12 which would normally be taken as referring to written
 13 reports, though it doesn't say that. And I'm -- that
 14 makes me concerned. I'm not sure where to go with it.
 15 MR. BAIR: 
 Well, I think two points, Your Honor. 16 One, counsel did testify and it was undisputed -- it was
 17 never in any way negated through cross examination or any
 18 other vehicle -- that he knew of sexual abuse. In fact,
 19 he specifically answered the question, the more specific
 20 sexual abuse question, I knew about the Job Corps
 21 overture. So those answers are unequivocal and they stand
 22 in the record unchallenged.
 23 QUESTION: Yes, but that's troubling because the
 24 Job Corps overture is -- is quite mild compared to the
 25 repeated days, months-on-end physical abuse suffered at

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 the hands of the stepfather.
 2 MR. BAIR: I agree.
 3 QUESTION: And it seems to me that this -- well,
 4 I'll ask you. Does this permit us to make the inference
 5 that if he had known this, he would have brought it out?
 6 MR. BAIR: I think --
 7 QUESTION: Because it's just very difficult to
 8 see why he would not have.
 9 MR. BAIR: Well, I think he made a -- a
 10 reasonable tactical decision.
 11 QUESTION: That goes to the tactical point.
 12 MR. BAIR: I think he made a reasonable tactical
 13 decision. He had a powerful case. Under Maryland law,
 14 the jury had to find unanimously and beyond a reasonable
 15 doubt that Wiggins was the principal, that is, the actual 16 killer in this case.
 17 They also had to find unanimously and beyond a
 18 reasonable doubt that the murder and the robbery occurred
 19 at the same time, and there was evidence in this case. 
 20 This was a very unusual situation in that it wasn't even
 21 clear whether the robbery occurred simultaneously with the
 22 murder. There was a -- there was a -- a huge dispute at
 23 trial and at sentencing over when Ms. Lacs was killed
 24 because her body was discovered on a Saturday. Wiggins
 25 was in possession of her car --

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Mr. Bair, may I ask? Did counsel
 2 during the -- the sentencing hearing come up with a theory
 3 as to what happened other than that his client was the
 4 killer?
 5 MR. BAIR: Yes, absolutely. He challenged
 6 and -- and very strenuously both during opening and -- and
 7 closing -- pointed out the evidence in the case that
 8 showed there were five fingerprints in Ms. Lacs' apartment
 9 that were not tied to anyone. There was a hat, some sort
 10 of a baseball hat, that was in the apartment.
 11 QUESTION: No, I understand -- but did he -- did
 12 he suggest who they might have belonged to? Did he come
 13 up with a theory as to who --
 14 MR. BAIR: No. I don't -- I don't think there
 15 was any particular person who was another suspect. 16 QUESTION: He didn't suggest that the man who
 17 lived downstairs might have been involved.
 18 MR. BAIR: No. And that -- that was never
 19 challenged as part of any ineffective assistance of
 20 counsel in these proceedings, Your Honor.
 21 QUESTION: Mr. Bair, what -- what do you respond
 22 to opposing counsel's argument that it doesn't matter
 23 because you didn't know until the eve of trial that you
 24 wouldn't have had a bifurcated proceeding, so you should
 25 have been doing this research in contemplation of a

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 bifurcated proceeding?
 2 MR. BAIR: Well, Your Honor, first of all, of
 3 course, our position is they were doing it. They had,
 4 as -- as I said, lots of information. They were doing it. 
 5 They were -- they were keeping that option open.
 6 But another answer, Your Honor, is the evidence
 7 would not have been put on. The more evidence that --
 8 that actually came out in -- in, you know, the
 9 proceedings, the details that we've now learned of through
 10 the Selvog report, they are so double-edged. They are so
 11 potentially harmful particularly in the context of this
 12 case. Between the Selvog report and the lodged materials,
 13 the DSS records, the -- the jury would have heard not just
 14 that Kevin Wiggins was -- had been in foster care and had
 15 a clean record, which is all they did hear. In addition,
 16 if those records had come in, they would have heard that
 17 he hated his biological mother, that he was in fights with
 18 other foster children, that he had once stolen some
 19 gasoline and tried to set fire to -- to a building, that
 20 he had a disturbed personality --
 21 QUESTION: That all goes to explain why they
 22 wouldn't have put it in, but why didn't they put any of
 23 this in the proffer at the -- to the judge at the --
 24 MR. BAIR: There -- there was no need to, Your
 25 Honor. There's no need under Maryland law to give a

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 detailed proffer. They -- they did not want to tip off
 2 the other side as to any potential things that might be
 3 negative to their client.
 4 And again, to the degree that we don't know
 5 about the details, it -- it inures to the detriment of
 6 Wiggins. It was his burden to bring out all of this
 7 evidence and he didn't do it.
 8 QUESTION: Does -- does the strength of the
 9 mitigating evidence have anything to do with whether a
 10 bifurcated proceeding is allowed?
 11 MR. BAIR: No.
 12 QUESTION: Would they have been more likely to
 13 get the bifurcated proceeding if they had come up with a
 14 lot of information about his childhood and so forth?
 15 MR. BAIR: I don't believe so, Your Honor. Of
 16 course --
 17 QUESTION: What does it turn on then?
 18 MR. BAIR: I think it was -- it was the trial
 19 court's discretion. I think it was just a -- this was
 20 back in 1989. There wasn't a lot of definitive law on it
 21 at the time. Since then, the Maryland Court of Appeals
 22 has said absolutely not.
 23 QUESTION: Was there a transcript of that
 24 hearing? He just said, I want a bifurcated hearing and
 25 sat down, or did he say, I want a bifurcated hearing

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 because there's going to be very substantial mitigating
 2 evidence and I want the jury to consider that separately? 
 3 What did he -- do we have a transcript of what he said
 4 here?
 5 MR. BAIR: I think we do have a transcript, Your
 6 Honor, and my recollection is that there was a short
 7 discussion of it, not -- not a detailed discussion of it.
 8 QUESTION: No, but if he had been in a position
 9 to make a strong proffer, why wouldn't he have made it? 
 10 His case for a bifurcated hearing would have been stronger
 11 if he had had a strong proffer. Wouldn't it have been?
 12 MR. BAIR: It would have been stronger, Your
 13 Honor, but I think in all likelihood if you look -- if you
 14 look at the Maryland sentencing law, it contemplates it,
 15 as I said, the court of appeals in Maryland has since held 16 definitively. In fact, in the direct appeal in this case,
 17 in the Wiggins case itself on direct appeal, they have
 18 held that the Maryland sentencing procedure in capital
 19 cases requires that the jury go through certain steps, and
 20 those steps all have to be done at a unitary hearing. 
 21 Obviously, there's a bifurcated guilt/innocence and
 22 sentencing.
 23 QUESTION: Well --
 24 QUESTION: Well, obviously, the -- the defense
 25 counsel didn't know until the motion was made and ruled

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 upon for a bifurcated hearing whether the judge would
 2 grant it, and there's no reason presumably that defense
 3 counsel should not have investigated the mitigating
 4 circumstances pending that ruling.
 5 MR. BAIR: I agree.
 6 QUESTION: And yet, we don't have a clear
 7 understanding of what he knew. And in fact, did not
 8 defense counsel tell the jury for sentencing that they
 9 would be hearing evidence about the defendant's
 10 background --
 11 MR. BAIR: They -- they did --
 12 QUESTION: -- at sentencing? And then nothing
 13 was put on.
 14 MR. BAIR: No, not -- not really, Your Honor.
 15 QUESTION: 
 I mean, what -- what is the jury to 16 make of that? It's so odd.
 17 MR. BAIR: I don't -- I don't think so, Justice
 18 O'Connor. I think -- I think what counsel did is if you
 19 look at the essence of the -- the approach at sentencing,
 20 clearly it was we're contesting principalship. There was
 21 one comment about you're going to hear what a tough life
 22 he had.
 23 Now, that was done I think for a couple reasons. 
 24 One is the counsel knew that petitioner could allocute and
 25 probably would allocute personally to -- to the -- the

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 jury.
 2 They also knew that there was going to be a
 3 criminologist who was going to testify because the jury
 4 knew there was only two choices for this man, either life
 5 or death. That was -- and life without parole. But they
 6 knew it was either life or life without parole or death. 
 7 And they were also putting on evidence by a criminologist
 8 that would show that Wiggins would adjust well to a life
 9 sentence. So I think they -- they also knew that -- that
 10 the pre-sentence report --
 11 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Bair.
 12 MR. BAIR: Thank you, Your Honor.
 13 QUESTION: Mr. Himmelfarb, we'll hear from you.
 14 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB
 15 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 16 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
 17 MR. HIMMELFARB: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 18 please the Court:
 19 The position of the United States is that the
 20 Sixth Amendment imposed no obligation to present evidence
 21 of petitioner's background at sentencing. It imposed no
 22 obligation to conduct a more extensive investigation of
 23 his background before sentencing. Those conclusions
 24 follow from a straightforward application of Strickland
 25 versus Washington which judges attorney performance by a

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 single standard, whether it was reasonable under all the
 2 circumstances of the case.
 3 The decision to choose a principalship defense
 4 and to reject a mitigation defense falls comfortably
 5 within the wide range --
 6 QUESTION: What's the bifurcated -- I've never
 7 heard of a bifurcated sentencing hearing. How does that
 8 work?
 9 MR. HIMMELFARB: My understanding, Justice
 10 Breyer, is that the basis for the motion was that the
 11 principalship defense could be undermined by presenting
 12 the mitigating evidence, so they wanted to do it
 13 separately.
 14 QUESTION: Right. So what do you do? You
 15 present the principalship defense and then the jury votes 16 death or life, and then if they vote death, they go on and
 17 present the next one, and if the next jury or the same
 18 jury, having heard the other one, votes life, then it's
 19 life? I mean, I don't see how it works.
 20 MR. HIMMELFARB: My understanding is that under
 21 the theory advanced by petitioner's counsel in support of
 22 the bifurcation motion, principalship alone would be
 23 determined at the first phase of the sentencing. If the
 24 jury found principalship, there would be a second phase at
 25 which counsel could --

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Okay. Under those circumstances,
 2 they're saying that, obviously, in that motion he would
 3 have given everything he knew about the background since
 4 he thought it might work that way, and if he didn't,
 5 that's evidence, in fact, amazingly convincing evidence,
 6 that he didn't know. He didn't know about the sexual
 7 history.
 8 And the main argument they're making has nothing
 9 to do with the strategic choice. It has to do with his
 10 failure to investigate.
 11 So what's your -- what's your response?
 12 MR. HIMMELFARB: If you look at the actual
 13 proffer that was made in support of the bifurcation
 14 motion, which is at pages 44 and 45 of the joint appendix,
 15 what counsel said was, I can proffer to the court that in 16 a non-bifurcated proceeding, the defense is in a position
 17 of coming forward with evidence regarding psychological
 18 history on Mr. Wiggins.
 19 QUESTION: This is 40 -- page 44 of the appendix
 20 to the petition?
 21 MR. HIMMELFARB: No, Mr. Chief Justice. It's
 22 the joint appendix.
 23 QUESTION: Oh, the joint appendix?
 24 MR. HIMMELFARB: Page 44 at the bottom.
 25 I'm in a position to come forward with evidence

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 regarding psychological history on Mr. Wiggins, including
 2 aspects of his life history, including a diagnosis of a
 3 personality disorder, including diagnosis of some
 4 retardation. So --
 5 QUESTION: So he says nothing whatsoever about
 6 the most frightful sexual abuse, about having the mother
 7 who did all the things that this one particularly did, not
 8 feeding them, burning their hands on the stove, et cetera. 
 9 I won't list it. But I just don't see anything in the
 10 thing you've just read that suggests that he knew a single
 11 thing about that.
 12 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, it's true it was a
 13 general proffer rather than a highly particularized
 14 proffer.
 15 QUESTION: Yes. 
 And so their point is, 16 obviously, if he had known about it, he would have said
 17 something, and the fact that he didn't say something, when
 18 coupled with the ambiguities on the pages, you know, 404
 19 or 405 or 401-402 -- you get what we're talking about, the
 20 footnote -- coupled with that shows that the correct
 21 reading of that is he didn't know about it.
 22 MR. HIMMELFARB: I think there's an important
 23 point to keep in mind here. The constitutional right
 24 petitioner has raised in this case is not the duty to
 25 know, it's the duty to investigate. The claim is that the

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 investigation was constitutionally inadequate.
 2 And the other important thing to keep in mind is
 3 that there is significant evidence in the record that a
 4 significant investigation was done, an investigation which
 5 we think is constitutionally adequate.
 6 QUESTION: Mr. Himmelfarb, in that connection,
 7 there's something I'd like you to set me straight on.
 8 There was a statement at some point that each of the
 9 defense counsel thought the other was going to bear the
 10 laboring awe in working up the mitigation case. Now, it
 11 seems to me that each one thought the other was doing it
 12 and the other wasn't doing it. That would be ineffective
 13 representation if each one thought the other was
 14 investigating and it turned out neither investigated.
 15 MR. HIMMELFARB: 
 I agree that would be 16 problematic, but I don't think the record bears that
 17 suggestion out, again, going to the joint appendix.
 18 QUESTION: Well, where -- where do I get that
 19 notion from that each one thought the other was
 20 principally responsible for working up the mitigation
 21 case?
 22 MR. HIMMELFARB: Petitioner makes that argument
 23 in his brief, and there are record cites to support it.
 24 But we don't think the record cites do, in fact, support
 25 the notion that each counsel thought the other was

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 responsible for investigating the mitigation case.
 2 There were two lawyers, Schlaich and Nethercott. 
 3 At page 485 of the joint appendix, Schlaich testified that
 4 after he left the Baltimore County Public Defenders Office
 5 and went to another office, from that point forward his
 6 co-counsel, Ms. Nethercott, did most of the mitigation
 7 preparation with his guidance.
 8 Then Ms. Nethercott testified at the
 9 post-conviction hearing as well, and her testimony was
 10 that she had no responsibility for retaining experts,
 11 that that was Schlaich's responsibility.
 12 So I think that's a far cry from testimony by
 13 either that only the other one had responsibility for
 14 preparing the mitigation case. Each one was testifying
 15 about his or her particular responsibilities. 16 QUESTION: Yes, but where -- the page you refer
 17 to, he says, when asked what he did in -- in mitigation,
 18 he said, well, basically what we did in mitigation was
 19 attempt to retry the factual case and try to convince the
 20 jury on the principalship issue. That doesn't sound like
 21 the kind of mitigation we're talking about.
 22 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, that's right, Justice
 23 Stevens. It remains the case, though, that a substantial
 24 amount of investigation was done. That testimony --
 25 QUESTION: But this part of the transcript

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 certainly doesn't support that proposition.
 2 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well --
 3 QUESTION: That's the part you called our
 4 attention --
 5 MR. HIMMELFARB: -- in fairness to Mr. Schlaich,
 6 I think he was interpreting the question to mean what was
 7 your defense at sentencing, not so much what was your
 8 mitigation --
 9 QUESTION: That's right. So this part does not
 10 support the -- the proposition that he did any mitigating
 11 research himself or with the other person. He's talking
 12 about the principalship issue.
 13 MR. HIMMELFARB: I was just responding to
 14 Justice Ginsburg's question about whether it was true that
 15 each one testified that the other was responsible for the 16 investigation. My only point is that I don't think the
 17 record bears out that suggestion in petitioner's brief.
 18 QUESTION: But it also doesn't show that there
 19 was substantial investigation, which is what you went on
 20 to say, and I don't think it's supported.
 21 MR. HIMMELFARB: I do, Justice Kennedy. The
 22 investigation that was done in this case by trial counsel
 23 was not materially different from the investigation that
 24 was done by post-conviction counsel. It was trial
 25 counsel, after all, who obtained the social services

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 records that documented a history of neglect. Trial
 2 counsel directed public defender investigators to go out
 3 and interview petitioner's family members, which they did. 
 4 Trial counsel hired a psychologist to conduct clinical
 5 interviews of petitioner which were done.
 6 Really the only difference between what trial
 7 counsel did and what post-conviction counsel did was that
 8 post-conviction counsel hired a social worker, a so-called
 9 mitigation specialist, who supervised the investigation
 10 and pulled the information together in a report.
 11 But we're talking here about whether there is a
 12 constitutional deficiency in the investigation, and any
 13 difference in the two investigations, which is really the
 14 fact that the social worker was there in the one but not
 15 the other, we think can't have constitutional 16 significance.
 17 I do want to say a little bit about the duty to
 18 present claim because most of the focus in the argument
 19 has been on the question of the duty to investigate.
 20 We think that the principal defense was
 21 reasonable both because a finding of no principalship
 22 would have been an absolute bar to imposition of the death
 23 penalty and because the principalship case that the State
 24 put on here was so weak.
 25 We also think it was reasonable not to present a

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 mitigation defense either in addition to the principalship
 2 defense or instead of it. It was reasonable not to
 3 present it in addition to the principal defense because it
 4 had a -- a very serious possibility of undermining it. It
 5 was reasonable not to present it instead of the
 6 principalship defense because mitigating evidence is just
 7 that. It's evidence that would be weighed against
 8 aggravating circumstances. It might or might not lead to
 9 a sentence of death.
 10 A finding of no principalship is a categorical
 11 bar to imposition of the death penalty. If a single juror
 12 harbored a reasonable doubt about whether petitioner had
 13 carried out the killing himself, it would be obligated to
 14 return a verdict of life.
 15 QUESTION: 
 But presumably the -- the 16 determination of the facts about the murder was made in
 17 the trial when he was determined guilty or innocent, and
 18 they found him guilty. And so to try to redetermine that
 19 at sentencing and not to offer any evidence in mitigation,
 20 do you think we can say that's reasonable?
 21 MR. HIMMELFARB: Absolutely. There were two
 22 different issues, one issue at the guilt phase, one issue
 23 at the sentencing, as far as the -- as far as petitioner's
 24 role is concerned. He was charged with first degree
 25 murder. As the jury was instructed, a conviction of first

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 degree murder does not necessarily encompass a finding of
 2 principalship, a finding that petitioner himself had
 3 carried out the killing. So it was perfectly
 4 understandable that petitioner's counsel would think that
 5 contesting principalship at sentencing would be a
 6 reasonable strategy.
 7 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb.
 8 Mr. Verrilli, you have 4 minutes remaining.
 9 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.
 10 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 11 MR. VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
 12 I'd like to clarify the -- the facts surrounding
 13 the proffer because it's very important to understand how
 14 this unfolded.
 15 Counsel for Wiggins made a motion. That motion
 16 was argued on October 11th, 1989 and denied at that time,
 17 the first day of the sentencing hearing. But the proffer
 18 was not made at that time. What -- what counsel for my
 19 friend, the United States, described was what Mr. Schlaich
 20 he would proffer if he had to proffer. He made the actual
 21 proffer at the end of the sentencing proceeding, and it
 22 can be found at pages, I think, 349 to 51 of the -- 348 to
 23 51 of the joint appendix. And there's a lengthy proffer
 24 there of what he would have shown had he been able to put
 25 on his mitigation case in the -- in the method he wanted

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 to. So --
 2 QUESTION: He does that -- he does that to
 3 argue --
 4 MR. VERRILLI: He's making a record for --
 5 QUESTION: -- after the fact that that the
 6 judge --
 7 MR. VERRILLI: He's making a record for appeal,
 8 Justice Kennedy. Here's the -- here's what we would have
 9 suffered because we wouldn't have been -- we weren't able
 10 to put on all of this mitigating evidence, and here it is.
 11 And so the sum total of his mitigation case is
 12 right there on the pages. He's described what it is and
 13 it contains nothing about the horrible abuse that this boy
 14 suffered. Nothing.
 15 Now, with respect to the question of whose 16 responsibility it was, I think it is correct to focus on
 17 the -- the colloquy on page 485 of the -- of the joint
 18 appendix, but the question asked Mr. Schlaich there, as
 19 Justice Stevens' question suggested, was, well, he first
 20 says, well, it was Ms. Nethercott's job to develop
 21 mitigation. And then the question put to him is what
 22 guidance did you give her, obviously, about how to develop
 23 the mitigation case. And he says, well, what we decided
 24 to do was retry the factual case. That's the -- that's
 25 what he says he gave as guidance with respect to

54
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 developing the mitigation case. So it's -- it's
 2 completely clear that this was neglect. They just dropped
 3 the ball.
 4 Now, with respect to what they actually did at
 5 the sentencing proceeding, picking up on Justice
 6 O'Connor's questions, I think this is critical as well.
 7 Remember, Strickland says no hindsight, but
 8 that's an argument that works against the government in
 9 this case because what these lawyers actually did was, in
 10 opening statement, invite the jury specifically to
 11 consider not only the facts of the crime but, quote, who
 12 this person is, said they would hear he had a difficult
 13 life. And then they didn't deliver on that promise.
 14 But not only that, Dr. Johnson, the -- the
 15 criminologist, got up and testified, well, yes, violent 16 people do tend to adjust well in prison. Well, that's not
 17 focusing on principalship. That, once again, is inviting
 18 the jury beyond principalship into the mitigation inquiry
 19 and giving them some reason to -- to mitigate, but of
 20 course, omitting all of the extraordinarily powerful
 21 reasons to mitigate that the social history shows.
 22 And then third, there was as a matter of law in
 23 Maryland a pre-sentence report that had to go to the jury. 
 24 And there was nothing that Wiggins' lawyers could do to
 25 stop that. And that pre-sentence report gave a highly

55
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 misleading and negative portrayal of Wiggins' background. 
 2 And the -- what -- effect of what these lawyers did was to
 3 leave that unrebutted, further damaging Wiggins'
 4 prospects, further ensuring that he was going to get a
 5 death sentence.
 6 Now, if I could conclude by just reminding this
 7 Court that very recently in the Miller-El case, this Court
 8 said even in the context of Federal habeas, the
 9 deferential review of Federal habeas, there's a difference
 10 between deference and abdication. And what my friends on
 11 the other side are asking for here is the latter. They
 12 are asking for abdication. They are asking this Court to
 13 uphold a judgment even though the only factual finding the
 14 Maryland Court of Appeals made was wrong by clear and
 15 convincing evidence, and even though that proffer 16 demonstrates that Wiggins' lawyers did not do the work
 17 necessary and did not know the powerful mitigation case
 18 that could have been made to save this man's life.
 19 Thank you.
 20 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,
 21 Mr. Verrilli.
 22 The case is submitted.
 23 (Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the
 24 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
