2 (10:10 a.m.)

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

4 first today in Arbaugh v. Y & H Corporation.

5 Mr. Joseffer.

6 MR. SCHWARTZ: Mr. Schwartz.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Schwartz. Excuse

8 me. Mr. Schwartz.

9 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. SCHWARTZ

10 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11 MR. SCHWARTZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

12 please the Court:

13 A Federal court has subject matter

14 jurisdiction over a claim brought under title VII

15 regardless of whether an employer has 15 employees.

16 This is so because when Congress enacted title VII, it

17 included a specific jurisdictional grant and that grant

18 provides that jurisdiction will exist in the Federal

19 courts over all claims brought under the act.

20 This specific grant of jurisdiction is

21 consistent with the more general grant of jurisdiction

22 contained in 28 U.S.C. 1331 wherein Federal question

23 jurisdiction exists over all claims that arise under a

24 Federal law. Title VII is a Federal law.

25 The Fifth Circuit erred when it -- when it

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 determined that the employer numerosity issue went to

2 the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.

3 Indeed, when title VII was passed, Congress

4 actually expanded jurisdiction, the Federal question

5 issue of title VII, because at that time 28 U.S.C. 1331

6 had a $10,000 amount in controversy requirement that

7 Congress did away with because the jurisdictional grant

8 contained within title VII made no mention of the

9 $10,000 requirement.

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you say -- so now it's

11 essentially redundant. Now that 1331 has no

12 jurisdictional amount, no amount in controversy, the

13 jurisdictional provision in title VII is just going

14 over the same territory. It doesn't add or detract.

15 Is that so?

16 MR. SCHWARTZ: I would agree with that.

17 Indeed, the question --

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In the first sentence, but

19 not in the venue part.

20 MR. SCHWARTZ: Not in the venue part and --

21 and certainly -- because it does apply to which

22 district court a case should be brought. I would say

23 it -- it's redundant to the extent of conferring

24 jurisdiction to a Federal court, but not on the venue

25 provision --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which is not subject

2 matter jurisdiction, which is what we're concerned with

3 here.

4 MR. SCHWARTZ: Right. It's not an issue in

5 this case.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the

7 argument, though, that when you're talking about a

8 threshold question like coverage, who the statute

9 covers, and it's quite different from the cause of

10 action cases, many of which you rely on in your brief?

11 MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, we're talking here about

12 a question of whether or not coverage is subject matter

13 jurisdiction, and it's our position that once you go

14 beyond the text and you start evaluating the various

15 aspects of title VII, Mr. Chief Justice, you are going

16 down a -- a slippery slope.

17 An example would be a case perhaps where a --

18 in fact, a case that I'm currently involved in where a

19 plaintiff is alleging that they were discharged

20 discriminatorily. And the reality is from the

21 employer's perspective, that that person was never

22 terminated. They're still an active employee. That is

23 an essential issue of a cause of action. The coverage

24 of title VII --

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's more a question

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of -- of whether or not the -- there's been a violation

2 of title VII. It seems to me that the number of

3 employee issue is whether you're covered at all,

4 whether you have to conform your conduct to that law.

5 Your question -- your -- your case of whether someone

6 has been discharged or not just goes to whether there's

7 been a violation.

8 MR. SCHWARTZ: That's correct, Mr. Chief

9 Justice, but I believe that the analogy applies because

10 it still goes to whether or not you start reading the

11 act beyond the jurisdictional grant. It's unnecessary

12 to go beyond the jurisdictional grant because --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in City of -- in

14 City of Kenosha, of course, the Court went beyond the

15 jurisdictional grant and it said that the definition of

16 the term person in 1983 raised a jurisdictional

17 question.

18 MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, I -- I would not

19 necessarily agree that that goes beyond the

20 jurisdictional grant because the jurisdictional grant

21 of -- contained in 1334 -- 1343 requires that -- that

22 jurisdiction apply against a person acting under color

23 of State law. And that's an example which Congress has

24 done many times of putting qualifiers within a

25 jurisdictional grant.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 An example of -- of that we have -- we attached

2 60 such statutes to our appendix in our reply brief, but

3 a specific example, which I think is applicable here, is

4 the Uniformed Service Employee Reemployment Rights Act

5 wherein Congress put in that the act would only apply

6 jurisdictionally, subject matter jurisdictionally,

7 against employers. And then there's a subsequent

8 definition of employer further on in -- in the statute

9 which is missing here because title --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the practical

11 consequence of the one or the other? Number one, if

12 you don't raise it below, you can still raise it on

13 appeal if it's jurisdictional. Right?

14 MR. SCHWARTZ: That's correct.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: And number two, the -- if

16 it's a jurisdictional question, it would be decided by

17 the -- by the judge rather than by the jury?

18 MR. SCHWARTZ: That's correct as well. And I

19 would go further that the practical problem is what

20 happened in our case where it wasn't raised in the

21 trial -- in -- in the case until after a trial on the

22 merits and after the jury returned the verdict, and we

23 wasted a lot of time. It -- it could have been brought

24 up beforehand as a -- a substantive motion for summary

25 judgment or a 12(b)(6) motion if the pleadings resolved

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the issue.

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's always the case.

3 I mean, why -- you know, if those disadvantages --

4 those disadvantages will always exist. So why would

5 Congress ever make something jurisdictional rather than

6 simply making it an element of the cause of action?

7 You understand what I'm saying? I mean, that's always

8 a consequence.

9 MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, I -- I think the --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: And yet, you -- you

11 acknowledge that some things are jurisdictional.

12 MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, I -- I think if I'm --

13 if I'm an attorney representing a plaintiff and I want

14 to make an evaluation of whether or not I have a claim,

15 I want to first evaluate do I pass a jurisdictional

16 threshold. If a come -- a person comes into my office

17 and says, look, this happened to me, I want to bring a

18 cause of action, and I know that they employ less than

19 15 people, then I'm not going to waste my time.

20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but what's the rule

21 that you suggest we look to in deciding whether a

22 provision is jurisdictional? Because, as the Chief

23 Justice pointed out, in 1983 cases where the question

24 is whether the defendant is a person, we've held that

25 is jurisdictional. So what is the rule in telling us

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 when we should treat something as jurisdictional?

2 MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, the rule that has

3 existed for some time now, going back to Bell v. Hood,

4 is a -- a fair way to look at this. If a statute, a

5 Federal law, creates a cause of action, then a cause --

6 a cause of action lies absent Congress expressly

7 limiting or qualifying an -- a jurisdictional element

8 within its grant contained within that law, which is --

9 which is missing completely in title VII.

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would you call this?

11 Would you call 15 or more employees an element of your

12 claim that you must prove?

13 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Or there could be an

15 affirmative defense and you're not claiming the latter.

16 MR. SCHWARTZ: It could be an affirmative

17 defense.

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're -- you're

19 accepting that it is your burden rather than the

20 employer's to show that the employer had fewer than 15

21 employees.

22 MR. SCHWARTZ: More than 15, yes, Your Honor.

23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: More than.

24 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. That -- that's the

25 plaintiff's burden just like it's the plaintiff's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 burden to prove that they were terminated --

2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Did you establish that in

3 the course of the proceedings?

4 MR. SCHWARTZ: We did not plead it with

5 particularity. We pled that the employer sexually

6 harassed the plaintiff, and then thereafter in the

7 pretrial order, it was not raised as a contested issue

8 of fact. And I believe the law of the case doctrine

9 would control in that instance because the --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to ask what --

11 how does the waiver work? Suppose the judge pre-

12 verdict says, you know, I'm concerned that there are

13 less than 15 employees. Can the plaintiff say, oh,

14 well, now, Your Honor, you can't get into that? They

15 waived that. They didn't raise it. I mean, how does

16 that work?

17 MR. SCHWARTZ: If it's -- if it doesn't go to

18 the subject matter jurisdiction --

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under your theory of the

20 case?

21 MR. SCHWARTZ: -- then I would say that it is

22 waived, if it's been answered --

23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but if it's your

24 burden to prove it, how can it be waived by the

25 defendant? I don't understand your theory.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean the judge just has

2 to watch the case sail over the waterfall and --

3 MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, let's talk about two

4 different examples. If we have pled with particularity

5 that the employer has 15 or more employees and is

6 subject to title VII for liability purposes and the

7 defendant in their answer admits that fact, then that

8 becomes a -- a admission --

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in my case nobody

10 mentions it but the judge.

11 MR. SCHWARTZ: All right. So we have alleged

12 in our lawsuit that the employer terminated or sexually

13 harassed the plaintiff and the -- there is not -- it's

14 not particularly pled. Is that the hypothetical,

15 Justice Kennedy?

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, and the -- and the

17 judge calls it sua sponte to the attention of the

18 parties.

19 MR. SCHWARTZ: I would think that if the

20 judge in a -- in a Federal cause of action was troubled

21 by any element of the claim, based upon his or her own

22 review of the factual setting, it's conceivable that --

23 that the court then could entertain motions on that

24 particular issue.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. You -- you

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 pleaded -- you pleaded that -- that the defendant was

2 -- was an employer under the act. Right?

3 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it's the definition of

5 employer that says he has to have more than -- more

6 than 15 employees. So, in effect, you -- in making

7 your complaint, you -- you at least implied and maybe

8 said that this person is an employer under the act. So

9 it seems to me at that point the -- the burden shifts

10 to the other side to say -- the burden of going forward

11 of saying no, this person isn't an employer under the

12 act, and if they say nothing, then they've accepted

13 what -- what your complaint on its face says.

14 MR. SCHWARTZ: I agree with you, Justice

15 Scalia.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: I knew you would.

17 (Laughter.)

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but maybe --

19 but that doesn't sound like a reasonable agreement.

20 All you -- so you file one sentence saying this person

21 violated title VII. Are you impliedly including all of

22 the allegations of what constitutes a violation of

23 title VII because if you didn't allege every particular

24 element, it wouldn't be a violation of title VII?

25 That's not how pleading works.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SCHWARTZ: No. And -- and I can -- I can

2 tell you, Mr. Chief Justice, I have probably handled

3 500 causes of action for discrimination cases, and I've

4 never seen anybody plead the issue of whether or not

5 somebody has 15 employees. It's just not done.

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: In your pleadings, did you

7 say he's an employer?

8 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Did you use the term

10 employer?

11 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes, Justice Souter.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

13 MR. SCHWARTZ: And -- and it was admitted and

14 then it was never challenged thereafter until after the

15 verdict.

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does it -- you -- you

17 told us of your extensive experience. How does the

18 numerosity requirement usually come up? You've

19 accepted that it's an element of your claim rather than

20 an affirmative defense the defendant must plead and

21 prove. So how does it ordinarily come up? Does it --

22 because defendant answers and asserts that it has fewer

23 than 15 employees?

24 MR. SCHWARTZ: I can give you one real-world

25 example, Justice Ginsburg. I represented a defendant

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in a case that didn't employ 15 people, and when I

2 attempted to convince the plaintiff -- plaintiff's

3 lawyer of that fact after the litigation commenced and

4 they weren't willing to -- to go ahead and voluntarily

5 dismiss, I simply filed a motion for summary judgment

6 attaching affidavit material, including payroll

7 records. And then once the plaintiff's attorney

8 reviewed that, they voluntarily gave up and the case

9 was dismissed. That would be the way it would normally

10 play out, provided it's not held to be an issue of

11 subject matter jurisdiction.

12 Another reason why this should not be a

13 subject matter jurisdiction goes to the practical

14 elements of the way this would progress in litigation

15 and title VII's admonition, which is a rare admonition

16 in legislation, that title VII cases be heard in an --

17 is in an expedited way. In enacting that particular

18 language, it appears to me that Congress was

19 acknowledging that this is a very important law. We're

20 trying to remediate a terrible wrong, that is,

21 employment discrimination. So we don't want these

22 cases to languish. It's almost as though it's being

23 processed like a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure

24 injunction proceeding, that this is a case that should

25 move very quickly.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And many courts, like the one across the

2 river in Virginia that are known as so-called rocket

3 dockets, process these cases on a very fast track. I

4 know that -- that court does it. Other courts that I

5 practice in do it as well where it is not uncommon that

6 from the pleading that a trial is set as quickly as

7 6 months thereafter. If this was to be subject matter

8 jurisdiction and we had to initially litigate the

9 question of whether or not the person is an employer

10 and putting aside all other issues in the case, it

11 would invariably result in a dragged-out process.

12 In our case, as we -- as we noted --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's true in a lot

14 of areas. I think of admiralty. If there's an issue

15 of admiralty jurisdiction that questions whether an

16 injury is caused by a vessel in navigable water, you

17 often have extended litigation over that jurisdictional

18 question.

19 MR. SCHWARTZ: And -- and in those cases, the

20 jurisdictional grant in the Jones Act does include

21 elements of jurisdiction. So it's -- it's required.

22 But I don't -- I don't believe that the Jones

23 Act has the same type of language, Mr. Chief Justice,

24 that title VII has, requiring that these cases be heard

25 expeditiously. So --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it -- does it have to

2 be resolved preliminarily? Why can't you leave the

3 jurisdictional question to be decided at the conclusion

4 of the trial with all the other questions? Is there

5 some rule of law that says that a jurisdictional

6 question must be confronted before the trial and before

7 the merits?

8 Indeed, most jurisdictional questions are

9 reexamined as the trial proceeds. That is, you know,

10 initially the court will say, yes, there appears to be

11 jurisdiction on the basis of the pleading. Then if

12 there's a motion to dismiss, yes, there -- there

13 appears to be jurisdiction on the basis of the

14 affidavits. But then if the trial proceeds and it

15 turns out that, in fact, there isn't jurisdiction, the

16 court dismisses. So why couldn't this jurisdictional

17 question always be handled that way? Just -- just

18 leave it to be resolved during the trial. It wouldn't

19 slow anything up.

20 MR. SCHWARTZ: There -- there's a few

21 problems with that. One is that it is not uncommon in

22 title VII cases that there are supplemental State

23 claims brought in the cause of action, and so we would

24 have a situation where there would be a lot of wasted

25 effort on the pending claim if, at some point, Justice

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Scalia, at the end of the day the case was dismissed on

2 subject matter jurisdiction.

3 That was s situation in our case where we

4 had a pendant tort claim for battery, and we also had a

5 pendant claim under the ancillary Louisiana

6 discrimination statute.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So this is a third

8 consequence of the jurisdictional issue.

9 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: If the issue is

11 jurisdictional, all the pendant State claims don't

12 belong there and they've got to be chucked out;

13 whereas, if it just goes to the merits, the pendant

14 claims are properly before the court.

15 MR. SCHWARTZ: That's right, Your Honor.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's an important

17 consequence.

18 MR. SCHWARTZ: In addition, the Court's

19 recent opinions addressing subject matter jurisdiction

20 have all gone back, it seems to me, to this question of

21 what does the text say. The -- the issue of not

22 conflating the use of the word jurisdiction, which has

23 been referenced in a number of the Court's opinions,

24 Steel Company, Kontrick, Eberhart, Scarborough, all

25 point to the fact that where the text is clear, as it

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 is in this case, and there is no ambiguity, then

2 subject matter jurisdiction lies if a claim is brought

3 under a Federal act.

4 If there's no further questions, I'd like

5 to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

7 Schwartz.

8 Now Mr. Joseffer.

9 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER

10 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

11 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PLAINTIFF

12 MR. JOSEFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

13 please the Court:

14 Justice O'Connor, we think the rule here,

15 because it's a question of congressional intent, is

16 simply how to best interpret the relevant statutes.

17 Here, Congress twice unambiguously conferred

18 jurisdiction over all title VII claims, at least twice:

19 first in section 1331 and again in the title VII

20 jurisdictional provision which confers jurisdiction

21 over all claims brought under title VII.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Joseffer, maybe you

23 can raise the podium a bit so the microphone works

24 better. The other way.

25 MR. JOSEFFER: Sorry. Is that better? Thank

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you.

2 As I was saying, the question is -- is --

3 because it's a question of congressional intent, we

4 think normal rules of construction apply.

5 And, Justice Ginsburg, you asked about

6 whether the title VII subject matter jurisdictional

7 provision is now redundant in light of the reduction of

8 the amount of controversy from section 1331.

9 Technically we think the answer is yes, but it still

10 has great interpretive value because it shows that when

11 Congress meant to address the jurisdictional question

12 in title VII, it expressly said so and it did so by

13 conferring jurisdiction over all title VII claims.

14 The definition of employer, which is the

15 relevant issue here, does not itself speak in

16 jurisdictional terms and does not modify in any way

17 title VII's broad jurisdictional provision.

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what about the

19 EEOC having typed the question jurisdictional for

20 administrative processing purposes?

21 MR. JOSEFFER: Right. Well, as the Court has

22 remarked on multiple occasions, the word jurisdiction

23 is a word of many, many meanings, and the EEOC has

24 never said that it's a question of the subject matter

25 jurisdiction of the Federal courts. It was -- until

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 about 5 or 6 years ago, EEOC in an administrative

2 context used the word jurisdiction to refer to the

3 definition of employer, statutes of limitations, and a

4 variety of other matters that are clearly not subject

5 matter jurisdictional.

6 But after this Court held in Zipes that

7 another provision of title VII is not one of subject

8 matter jurisdiction, EEOC realized that its

9 administrative use of the broad term jurisdiction was

10 confusing. So 5 or 6 years ago, EEOC amended its

11 compliance manual and no longer refers to any of these

12 questions as jurisdictional. But I guess the key point

13 is it never said it was on subject matter jurisdiction.

14 And Mr. Chief Justice, you asked about

15 whether a threshold question of coverage could be

16 considered different than another element of the cause

17 of action. I think the important thing here is that

18 the place where Congress used the term person is in

19 setting forth what conduct is unlawful. Title VII says

20 that it shall be an unlawful employment practice for a

21 person to discriminate in various ways. So the way the

22 definition is irrelevant is in setting forth the scope

23 of unlawful conduct which is a quintessential merits or

24 cause of action inquiry as opposed to a jurisdictional

25 one.

1 The City of Kenosha is different because, as

2 petitioner's counsel recognized, that interpreted not

3 section 1331 but section 1343 which --

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Interpreted section

5 -- the use of the word person in section 1983.

6 MR. JOSEFFER: Interpreted the word person in

7 section 1983 not to apply to municipal corporations,

8 but with respect to the jurisdictional inquiry, it said

9 that the -- that 1343 did not confer jurisdiction.

10 In Mt. Healthy several years later, the Court

11 held that although section 1343 was narrowly limited to

12 actions that are quote, authorized by law, which

13 connoted somewhat of a merits inquiry, section 1331's

14 jurisdictional provision is not so limited and is not

15 limited by the definition of person, which is what the

16 Court held in section 1331.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So City of Kenosha

18 was just kind of a silly waste of time.

19 MR. JOSEFFER: Well --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 1331 was applicable

21 there as well. Right?

22 MR. JOSEFFER: At the time section 1331 had

23 the amount in controversy requirement, and I think

24 that's why now that section 1331 no longer has the

25 amount in controversy requirement, this Court's section

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 1343 cases have more or less petered out because

2 plaintiffs can now just go under section 1331.

3 And Justice Scalia, you asked about the --

4 the practical consequences. I agree there are three

5 practical consequences, and from that perspective, it

6 makes little sense to believe that Congress would have

7 thought that this requirement should be jurisdictional.

8 The first is whether the issue can be raised at any

9 point in the litigation. The second is who decides the

10 issue, and the third is whether, after dismissal of the

11 Federal claims, the State law claims must be dismissed

12 for lack of jurisdiction.

13 And given that this is just one of many facts

14 that arises in determining whether a plaintiff can

15 state a valid title VII claim, it's hard to believe

16 that Congress would have thought that this is the one

17 fact that should be raised at the end of the case

18 instead of at the outset where it can be adjudicated in

19 an orderly manner with all of the other facts.

20 Also, common law juries have been deciding

21 for centuries whether a worker is an employee or an

22 independent contractor for purposes of agency and tort

23 law. And since that is the ultimate dispute here, it

24 seems remarkable to think that that's the one fact that

25 Congress would say should not go to a jury.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And similarly --

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What have

3 juries been determining?

4 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, the question as to

5 whether there are 15 employees here --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

7 MR. JOSEFFER: -- turns on whether some

8 workers are independent contractors or employees. And

9 for agency law purposes, which becomes relevant in tort

10 law in terms of vicarious liability, the question

11 whether someone is an employee or an independent

12 contractor is a -- is a longstanding jury question.

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the question was

14 whether the truck drivers counted as employees because

15 if they did, they'd have enough?

16 MR. JOSEFFER: Right. If the -- if the -- if

17 those -- if the delivery drivers were workers -- were

18 employees, there's no question there were 15 employees.

19 So the question was whether some workers count as

20 employees and whether a worker is an employee or an

21 independent contractor is -- is a longstanding question

22 for a jury when there's a disputed issue of -- of fact.

23 And then the third consequence -- I mean,

24 here, there -- the jury rendered a verdict on the State

25 law claims, found in favor of respondent on one,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 petitioner on the other. And it seems highly unlikely

2 that Congress would think that that jury verdict should

3 be vacated and the case retried in State court because

4 the defendant has 14 instead of 15 employees.

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's the --

6 that's a consequence of a determination that it's

7 jurisdictional in any case. Right?

8 MR. JOSEFFER: That's correct, and there --

9 there are circumstances --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, if you had a

11 case where you didn't dispute that the issue was

12 jurisdictional and there had been a jury trial on the

13 pendant State law claims, we'd still have to throw that

14 out. Right?

15 MR. JOSEFFER: Yes, but I think that's one

16 reason that Congress does not ordinarily make

17 jurisdiction turn on those types of facts. In the

18 admiralty concept -- context that you recognized, it's

19 necessary to distinguish between admiralty jurisdiction

20 and general Federal question jurisdiction. So Congress

21 had to distinguish in some way, and the way it did was

22 by saying, well, is the alleged injury caused by a

23 vessel in navigable waters or elsewhere.

24 But ordinarily when -- a distinction does not

25 have to be drawn like that. In section 1343, it was

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the same because Congress didn't want that to be

2 conflated with section 1331 at the time. When

3 jurisdiction does not necessarily turn on contextual

4 factors, Congress ordinarily just lets the broad

5 jurisdictional ground of section 1331 be a clear,

6 simple threshold inquiry so parties can determine

7 they're in the right court, and then the case can be

8 proceeded -- can be litigated on the merits from there.

9 Justice Kennedy asked whether a court could

10 raise the issue on its own, even assuming that it's a

11 merits issue. And I think the answer is that although

12 the defendant waived the issue here and therefore has

13 no right to insist that it be raised, most waiver

14 doctrines are discretionary, and therefore, courts

15 retain some inherent discretion to overlook waivers in

16 some circumstances. That discretion would be greater

17 at the outset of a case where a Federal court decided

18 it should not be deciding a case than it would be once

19 a jury had already decided the case, which is what

20 happened here.

21 Finally, respondent relies on a number of

22 this Court's title VII decisions for the proposition

23 that this requirement is one of subject matter

24 jurisdiction. The basic point is that this Court has

25 never opined in dicta or in holding on whether this

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 requirement is one of subject matter jurisdiction of

2 the courts. This Court's only title VII subject matter

3 jurisdiction case is Zipes which held that a

4 requirement was not jurisdictional because it was not

5 -- did not textually modify title VII's broad

6 jurisdictional provision and in light of other relevant

7 canons of construction. And for precisely the same

8 reasons, the definition of employer does not textually

9 modify the definitional provision and therefore it does

10 not limit the court's subject matter jurisdiction to

11 adjudicate this claim either up or down based on its

12 merits.

13 If the Court has no further questions, I have

14 nothing further.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

16 Joseffer.

17 Mr. Prendergast, we'll now hear from you.

18 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRETT D. PRENDERGAST

19 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20 MR. PRENDERGAST: Mr. Chief Justice, may it

21 please the Court:

22 I have to start off by disagreeing with my

23 learned colleagues on at least three areas.

24 First of all, Mr. Schwartz indicated that the

25 plaintiff pled that the defendant Y & H was an employer

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in this matter. That is inaccurate. What the

2 defendant actually pled and which became the subject of

3 the subsequent post-trial motions was that the court

4 had jurisdiction, and when the matter of the number of

5 employees was raised, that was the pleading -- the

6 allegation in the complaint that the plaintiff raised

7 to say this issue has been waived. There was no

8 specific pleading in the complaint that said that Y & H

9 qualified for the definition of an employer under title

10 VII. There was no pleading that Y & H had 15 or more

11 employees for the 20 or more weeks that were necessary.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no -- there was

13 no allegation that the plaintiff was employed by your

14 client?

15 MR. PRENDERGAST: There was an allegation,

16 Your Honor, that the plaintiff was employed by the

17 company, but there was no allegation that Y & H was an

18 employer as the term is defined in title VII.

19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was the --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Was the word employer used

21 in the pleadings?

22 MR. PRENDERGAST: I don't recall, Your Honor,

23 whether or not the word employer was used. I think it

24 was clearly stated that -- and -- and there's no doubt

25 Ms. Arbaugh was, in fact, employed by Y & H.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I'm just asking the

2 really formal question. Was the word employer used to

3 refer to your client at any point in the pleadings?

4 MR. PRENDERGAST: I'm -- I'm not sure, Your

5 Honor.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have the complaint

7 in --

8 MR. PRENDERGAST: In the record, yes, Your

9 Honor.

10 JUSTICE BREYER: Was there an allegation that

11 the company, petitioner, or whatever it was -- that

12 they violated the act?

13 MR. PRENDERGAST: There was an allegation,

14 Your Honor, that --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: All right -- I guess that --

16 they must have thought that there were 15 or more

17 employees because otherwise you wouldn't have.

18 MR. PRENDERGAST: Right. And -- and

19 naturally, though, Your Honor, that was denied.

20 The -- the admission that the plaintiff

21 relied upon in the post-trial motions was the

22 allegation that this Court has jurisdiction under title

23 VII, under the relevant provision.

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Was that denied?

25 MR. PRENDERGAST: That was admitted. The

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 jurisdiction was admitted, and -- and in the post-trial

2 motions, that was the issue that the plaintiff hung

3 their hat on to come back and say this issue is -- is

4 established and stipulated. There was clearly no

5 admission that the --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: You denied it. Then they

7 presented evidence, and their evidence was A, B, C, D,

8 E. And I guess then you presented some contrary

9 evidence, and you didn't present any evidence that he

10 wasn't an employer. So I guess the odds are he was.

11 MR. PRENDERGAST: Well, there was -- but --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: And if the odds are he was,

13 they win in the absence of any evidence.

14 MR. PRENDERGAST: Justice Breyer, if an

15 employer -- and -- and I disagree with the position

16 that it's -- I -- I think it is an element of the

17 merits in addition to being an element of jurisdiction.

18 But if a plaintiff has that as part of their burden of

19 proof, then the plaintiff naturally has to introduce

20 evidence --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: Then I guess maybe you could

22 have appealed on that point. So did you?

23 MR. PRENDERGAST: No, Your Honor, because --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Then I guess it's waived

25 unless it's jurisdictional.  So we're back to the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 jurisdictional question.

2 MR. PRENDERGAST: And which we maintain that

3 it is jurisdictional. I'm not sure, Your Honor,

4 whether or not there is, in fact, any waiver because --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: I never heard of a point on

6 the merits that if you -- you think you're right. It's

7 right on the merits, the element of the offense. You

8 don't think they proved it, but unfortunately, you

9 don't raise that in the appeal.

10 MR. PRENDERGAST: No, Your Honor, we didn't

11 raise it in the appeal, the reason being that while the

12 matter was still pending in the trial court, in

13 addition to the motion to dismiss for jurisdiction,

14 which was granted, there was a motion for a renewed

15 judgment as a matter of law, which included the

16 plaintiff's failure to maintain their burden of proof.

17 JUSTICE BREYER: And did you win or lose on

18 that?

19 MR. PRENDERGAST: That was dismissed as moot

20 because of the jurisdictional issue, Your Honor. So

21 whether or not that is waived or not -- I agree with

22 you. It's not before this Court today, but I don't

23 think it's a matter that can be decided by this Court

24 either. It's a matter, if this Court should decide

25 that it is a merits issue, that goes back to the trial

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 court on remand.

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What other aspects of

3 title VII do you think are jurisdictional?

4 MR. PRENDERGAST: I think the other aspects

5 -- and clearly, this has not been the subject of as

6 great a research -- would be the other ones that

7 designate the scope or the coverage of the act, for

8 example, especially as it relates to employer.

9 At least three circuit -- and in addition to

10 excluding small companies as employers, the act also

11 includes as -- excludes as employers private membership

12 clubs, the Government, the United States, agencies of

13 the United States, wholly owned corporations of the

14 United States, and also Indian tribes. At least three

15 circuit courts have held that Indian tribes and their

16 status is a matter of subject matter jurisdiction.

17 That's the Fifth Circuit in Thomas v. Choctaw, the

18 Tenth Circuit in Duke v. Absentee Shawnee Tribe, and

19 the Ninth Circuit in --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do they hold that the

21 plaintiff must allege the employer is not an Indian

22 tribe? I'm over here.

23 MR. PRENDERGAST: I'm sorry.

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Over here.

25 (Laughter.)

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: I say in -- in those case

2 that you just cited, did they hold that the plaintiff

3 must allege that the employer is not an Indian tribe?

4 MR. PRENDERGAST: I don't think they got into

5 that matter, Justice Stevens. Instead, what they

6 simply decided was whether or not the -- the employer

7 was an Indian tribe. There was a question concerning

8 some of the structures and just the business

9 organizations that the Indian tribes were using and --

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you interpret those

11 cases as, in fact, holding that if there was a trial

12 and a judgment in favor of the plaintiff against what

13 turns out later to be an Indian tribe, that after the

14 case is taken up on appeal, the Indian tribe can have

15 the judgment set aside?

16 MR. PRENDERGAST: Yes, Your Honor, because

17 the -- the cases did clearly hold that the matter of --

18 as an Indian tribe was a matter of subject matter

19 jurisdiction. And as a matter of subject matter

20 jurisdiction, it is completely established law that

21 that may not be waived. It may be raised at any time.

22 So --

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did it, in fact, come up

24 in that posture in the case? It has already been

25 mentioned that the word jurisdiction has many, too many

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 uses. Did it -- did the question come up in the Indian

2 tribe cases as it did here after the case was fully

3 tried and after there was a jury verdict for the

4 plaintiff?

5 MR. PRENDERGAST: No, Your Honor. Those were

6 cases where there were motions to dismiss based upon

7 lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When -- if -- if it's

9 brought up promptly, it really doesn't matter, does it,

10 whether you label it 12(b)(1) jurisdiction or 12(b)(6),

11 failure to state a claim? It goes out either way.

12 When it is consequential is when you bring it up, as

13 you did here, after you lose on -- at the trial.

14 MR. PRENDERGAST: I -- I think the effect

15 could be different when you raise it. I think there

16 can also be a difference in effect in how it will be

17 treated, even if it was promptly raised. I think, for

18 example, on a 12(b)(1) motion, I don't believe the --

19 the court is obligated to accept all the plaintiff's

20 pleadings. It's allowed to look outside the pleadings

21 to actually determine the jurisdiction. Whereas, in a

22 12(b)(6) motion, if the plaintiff says it's an Indian

23 tribe, it's an Indian tribe.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Prendergast --

25 MR. PRENDERGAST: Yes.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- my problem with -- with

2 your -- your contention is that I don't know how it is

3 that you -- that you intuit that this one definition is

4 jurisdictional. I mean, the definition -- the -- the

5 15 employee limit is -- is part of the definition of

6 employer in section 701.

7 MR. PRENDERGAST: Yes, Your Honor.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: There are 13 other

9 definitions in section 1701. For example, it defines

10 on the basis of sex. Now, if -- if you contest whether

11 a particular remark or a particular practice of the

12 employer was -- fell within that definition, was on the

13 basis of sex or not, would you say that the court had

14 no jurisdiction?

15 MR. PRENDERGAST: No, Your Honor.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Will you challenge -- well,

17 why are you challenging jurisdiction when you're --

18 when you're saying the -- the definition of -- of

19 employer has not been met, but you are not challenging

20 jurisdiction when you say the definition of on the

21 basis of sex has not been met. Why -- why pick on one

22 rather than the other?

23 MR. PRENDERGAST: I think the distinction is

24 similar to an Aldinger/Kenosha type distinction. And I

25 think the question goes back to it requires an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 interpretation of whether or not Congress wanted to

2 give the lower Federal courts the type of jurisdiction

3 being discussed.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I -- I understand that.

5 MR. PRENDERGAST: And -- and --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that's what it comes

7 down to.

8 MR. PRENDERGAST: And -- and --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: But how do you know --

10 MR. PRENDERGAST: Well, how --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: If both definitions in

12 section 701 --

13 MR. PRENDERGAST: How -- how do you know --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- why does one of them

15 express one thing and another not express --

16 MR. PRENDERGAST: Justice Scalia, the way you

17 know is because you look at the logical deductions that

18 can be drawn from the congressional statutes, as this

19 Court suggested in Aldinger.

20 And with respect to the other definitions, I

21 cannot speak categorically with respect to those other

22 definitions because that's not the matter before this

23 Court. I can't suggest to this Court a wholesale

24 general policy of these definitions are jurisdictional

25 and these definitions are not jurisdictional.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But the practical

2 consequences of affirming here are severe in terms of

3 handling these cases. And we've pointed out in some

4 recent cases of ours that we've been a little sloppy in

5 the past in using the word jurisdiction. So it looks

6 to me like there are many indicators that would point

7 to not treating the 15 employee requirement as one of

8 subject matter jurisdiction.

9 MR. PRENDERGAST: Justice O'Connor, I would

10 say the -- the consequences of not affirming are even

11 more severe. Congress, in 1964, made a clear decision

12 that it wanted small businesses not to be burdened with

13 --

14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but it's entirely in

15 the hands of the defendant to raise some objection.

16 Who knows better than the employer how many employees

17 the employer has had? I mean, it's totally within your

18 capacity to say, wait a minute --

19 MR. PRENDERGAST: But one --

20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- we didn't have 15.

21 MR. PRENDERGAST: -- one -- one of the -- one

22 of the concerns, I believe, that Congress did have with

23 respect to small employers was the fact that in the

24 terms of small employers, you are dealing with less

25 sophisticated litigants, less sophisticated litigants

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 with less access to legal resources that bigger

2 companies have.

3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Were you representing this

4 employer at the time?

5 MR. PRENDERGAST: No, Your Honor. I handled

6 this matter only post-trial.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's -- what's

8 wrong with the rule? We're not dealing with article

9 III here. What's wrong with the rule that if Congress

10 doesn't put it in the jurisdictional section, it's not

11 jurisdictional?

12 MR. PRENDERGAST: I think --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would make the

14 future cases a lot easier to decide.

15 MR. PRENDERGAST: I think that would be

16 contrary, however, Mr. Chief Justice, to the previous

17 holdings of this Court where they say you do look to

18 the logical deductions --

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's --

20 MR. PRENDERGAST: -- and you look to all the

21 statutes. For example, petitioner makes note of Zipes,

22 but if -- if the jurisdictional statute is going to be

23 the be all and end all of -- of the analysis and the

24 discussion, then Zipes would have merely looked and

25 said, oh, well, the statute of limitations is not in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the jurisdictional provision. End of discussion.

2 But Zipes didn't do that. Zipes said we need

3 to look at the -- the jurisdictional statute, the way

4 it's structured. We need to look at congressional

5 intent and the legislative history, how they referred

6 to this matter. We need to look at our prior cases how

7 we referred to this matter.

8 So I think to say just, okay, let's look at

9 the jurisdictional statute -- one, I think there are

10 two problems with it. One --

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I go back to Zipes?

12 In Zipes, the Court was faced with the -- the word

13 jurisdictional had been appended to the statute of

14 limitations. I think that was true of the way the EEOC

15 spoke of the rigid time limit, that it was mandatory

16 and jurisdictional. And then the Court explained in

17 Zipes that a strict time line doesn't mean that it's

18 jurisdictional. You can have a rule that's rigid, but

19 it doesn't determine subject matter jurisdiction. And

20 that's what Zipes tried to explain. The Court in Zipes

21 was faced with a number of cases that had used that

22 term to describe the time in which you must bring the

23 action, mandatory and jurisdictional.

24 MR. PRENDERGAST: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. But

25 Zipes also dealt with a legislative history where they

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 referred to it as a statute of limitations period.

2 Zipes also said, okay, we have other cases where we

3 have used the term jurisdictional, but more often than

4 not, we've referred to this as a limitations period.

5 Zipes looked at the whole context and said, yes, we're

6 not going to be held by a few random, maybe casual or

7 careless uses of the term jurisdictional, but we are

8 going to look at the whole thing.

9 Here, the legislative history has

10 traditionally referred to this as a jurisdictional

11 provision. The '72 amendments, which increase --

12 decrease the number of employees necessary from 25 to

13 15, referred to it as an expansion of jurisdiction.

14 This Court has had the matter come up before it always

15 in jurisdictional terms. This Court has referred to

16 this. EEOC has referred to it as jurisdictional.

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but now we know it's

18 -- EEOC has changed.

19 MR. PRENDERGAST: Seeing the errors of their

20 ways, I guess.

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why -- now that we do

22 have Zipes, why should the number of employees be

23 treated any differently than that rigid time line in --

24 in Zipes?

25 MR. PRENDERGAST: Your Honor, I think the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 reason that the number of employees should be different

2 -- treated differently is because we go back to the

3 Aldinger question, and the Aldinger question is this

4 Court has to decide did Congress want to give this type

5 of jurisdiction to the lower Federal courts.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was a pendant

7 jurisdiction case. Wasn't Aldinger --

8 MR. PRENDERGAST: Aldinger dealt with a

9 pendant party issue, yes, Your Honor.

10 Kenosha, however, dealt with -- as the Chief

11 Justice has indicated, Kenosha dealt with a definition

12 that excluded counties from section 1983 and that was

13 found to be implicitly brought into the -- the

14 jurisdictional grant for civil rights actions.

15 So I think the mere fact that something is or

16 is not in the jurisdictional statute cannot be

17 determinative because ultimately you do need to go back

18 to the question of did Congress want to give this type

19 of jurisdiction to the lower Federal courts.

20 My question would be why would Congress seek

21 to give this type of jurisdiction to the lower Federal

22 courts for a whole category of cases where, in the

23 words of this Court in Hishon, it has granted these

24 businesses complete immunity from title VII?

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you just used an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 interesting word because there are litigants who can

2 claim complete immunity from liability, but that

3 immunity, whether it's absolute or qualified, doesn't

4 go to the court's subject matter jurisdiction. It has

5 to be raised in those cases as a defense.

6 MR. PRENDERGAST: True, Justice Ginsburg.

7 The difference, however, between the immunity in those

8 cases and the type of immunity here that the Court

9 talked about in Hishon -- immunity for a police officer

10 in a civil rights case with qualified immunity will

11 depend upon a police officer's particular actions in

12 that particular case. The police officer, in general,

13 can be sued under section 1983.

14 The immunity that's present here, with

15 respect to small employers, has no relationship

16 whatsoever to the actions of that employer. An

17 employer who employs 12 people at most can engage in

18 the most egregious employment discrimination and

19 harassment possible, and the Congress of the United

20 States has said, as a policy matter, on balance we

21 would rather accept that kind of awful conduct because

22 we don't want to impose these burdens on small

23 businesses.

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Or leave it to the States

25 that often do cover smaller shops.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. PRENDERGAST: Yes, Your Honor, or leave

2 it to the States and let the States do it. But we

3 don't want the Federal Government to be intruding into

4 the operations -- into the culture of these small

5 businesses, and that I believe is the difference

6 between the immunity that you mentioned, the qualified

7 or prosecutorial type immunity, which depends upon

8 actions, and this immunity here which depends upon

9 simply the status of the defendant, the whole class --

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that -- that argument

11 doesn't apply to absolute immunity cases, and yet in

12 absolute immunity cases, once again, it's clear there's

13 jurisdiction. There's simply immunity. The immunity

14 doesn't depend on any particular facts.

15 MR. PRENDERGAST: The absolute immunity,

16 Justice Souter, that I'm most familiar with would be

17 prosecutorial immunity. I think there can still be

18 exceptions for prosecutorial immunity. I think a

19 prosecutor, depending upon the type of actions he's

20 engaged in, can still be subject to liability.

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: But we have to determine

22 whether he's acting as a prosecutor. Sure. We have to

23 determine whether the President was acting in a

24 presidential capacity, but that's not the kind of fact

25 inquiry that you were talking about with respect to the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 qualified immunity.

2 MR. PRENDERGAST: It certainly -- yes, Your

3 Honor, I will concede it's a different kind of inquiry.

4 But I -- I do think, though, here the categorical

5 exclusion of small businesses is a clear indication of

6 congressional intent of what Congress wanted to have

7 happen.

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I -- I don't see why the

9 same argument can't be made with respect to

10 prosecutors. It is clear that if -- if an individual

11 is acting in a prosecutorial capacity and enjoys the

12 appointment as a prosecutor, that at least the -- the

13 system -- we're not necessarily talking about Congress

14 here. The system says there -- there should be, as a

15 categorical matter, an -- an immunity from prosecution.

16 And yet, that does not go to subject matter

17 jurisdiction. And it seems to me that that is

18 essentially the exact argument that you're making here,

19 and I don't see why it should be any more sound here

20 than it would be in the absolute immunity case.

21 MR. PRENDERGAST: Another -- well, Your

22 Honor, I'll offer another distinction then. The other

23 distinction is prosecutorial immunity and qualified

24 immunity, for that matter, are court-created entities

25 --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's right.

2 MR. PRENDERGAST: -- court-created defenses.

3 And as this Court is well aware, this Court nor any

4 other court has the power to define subject matter

5 jurisdiction. That is Congress' purview and power.

6 Only Congress can limit the court's jurisdiction and

7 define the court's jurisdiction for the lower Federal

8 courts.

9 Here, Congress has spoken with respect to

10 small businesses. It's a different matter, I would

11 suggest, with respect to prosecutors, which is an

12 immunity that is -- is a product of common law and --

13 and a judicial creation.

14 I would also want to point out that --

15 another thing. The Solicitor General indicated that if

16 you look at the structure of the -- the liability

17 section, he implied that it just imposes the employer

18 definition into the -- all the other causes of action.

19 In fact, it does not. It says, it -- it shall be

20 unlawful for an employer to, and then it defines what

21 is unlawful. So I think there again it's indicating a

22 difference between other elements of the cause of

23 action and the employer relationship and the employer

24 existence under title VII.

25 Ultimately, what this boils down to is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 whether or not small businesses are going to continue

2 to receive the protection that Congress has indicated

3 that it wanted them to have.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why can't get they get

5 the protections through summary judgment?

6 MR. PRENDERGAST: I think they would be

7 offered some level of protection, Justice Souter,

8 through summary judgment. The problem is summary

9 judgment offers its own unique hurdles to a defendant.

10 And again, it's a difference --

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Among other things, you --

12 you've got to do it up front.

13 MR. PRENDERGAST: It's -- it's a different

14 standard as well, Your Honor, because under summary

15 judgment, a plaintiff has it within their capability --

16 have to view all the inferences in the light most

17 favorable to the plaintiff, and -- and the small

18 business could end up being dragged into the litigation

19 further and further than I think Congress intended.

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if -- if we're worried

21 about dragging people into litigation, I presume

22 Congress didn't intend, as a -- as a general matter, to

23 allow the -- the situation that we've got here. One

24 party has been dragged through a piece of litigation

25 and, having lost, has decided it wants to take another

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 shot at getting out of the case. Surely you can't say

2 that was within the contemplation of Congress' intent.

3 MR. PRENDERGAST: Your Honor, actually I -- I

4 would not have viewed it as outside of Congress'

5 contemplation or intent because Congress -- and I think

6 this is an important part of legislative history.

7 Congress in 1990 enacted the ADA, and they adopted the

8 employer definition from title VII. And at the time

9 that Congress adopted title VII's employer definition

10 for the ADA, all but one circuit court had decided that

11 this was a matter of subject matter jurisdiction. And

12 if you decide something is a matter of subject matter

13 jurisdiction, you take with it the unfairness. And I'm

14 not going to contend that it's not sometimes unfair to

15 parties, some of the consequences of subject matter

16 jurisdiction. But you take that with it when you

17 decide that it's a matter of subject matter

18 jurisdiction. And Congress in 1990 adopted for the ADA

19 the title VII definition. So it's implied that they

20 understood what was going on.

21 In 1991, they -- they had the Civil Rights

22 Act and amended and provided for jury trials in these

23 types of matters. And again, Congress was aware of the

24 state of the law.

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: My -- my point --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. PRENDERGAST: And Congress did not --

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- my point is not --

3 MR. PRENDERGAST: -- seek a change.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- my point is not that

5 Congress in some specific sense, when it establishes a

6 jurisdictional requirement, does not intend the

7 occasional costs that the system has to bear by virtue

8 of treating that requirement as jurisdictional.

9 My point simply is that if we are in -- in a

10 situation in which it is not clear whether it's

11 jurisdictional or not, and the issue can be raised, in

12 effect, up front effectively through summary judgment,

13 and in the alternative, can be treated -- and -- as --

14 as an ineffective fact element, and in the alternative,

15 can be left, in effect, forever to be raised as a

16 jurisdictional element. The fact that it can be

17 treated effectively up front is one reason to think

18 that Congress would probably have wanted that fact

19 issue to be regarded not as jurisdictional but as

20 elemental so that it can be gotten out of the way and

21 the parties are not going to go through entire trials

22 only to have the whole thing upset by a belated

23 jurisdictional argument. That's my only point.

24 MR. PRENDERGAST: And -- and, Justice Souter,

25 I understand that point. However, I -- I tend to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 believe that this is, after all, an aberration case.

2 Petitioner has suggested and the Solicitor General has

3 suggested that businesses may tend to sandbag this

4 issue. I simply do not believe that that is a

5 realistic danger at all. In this case, quite frankly,

6 the matter was overlooked, and that's how we ended up

7 here. But in most cases, these small businesses are

8 not going to be looking to spend a lot of money and go

9 through a whole trial and then say, oh, well, I had my

10 shot at it. Let me see. If -- if it doesn't work out

11 now, I'll get out as a matter of subject matter

12 jurisdiction. Most cases, small businesses are going

13 to say, make this case go away from me as fast as you

14 can. And so I don't think that that's really much of a

15 danger to suggest that this is a pattern that's going

16 to be repeated, especially after a decision from this

17 Court. If this Court, as we believe that it should,

18 comes down and holds that this is a matter of subject

19 matter jurisdiction, I think parties will raise the

20 matter and get it disposed of.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: In other words, it doesn't

22 make a whole lot of difference.

23 MR. PRENDERGAST: I think --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that helps your

25 case.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 (Laughter.)

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it make a

3 difference on the -- the -- does the categorization

4 make a difference on the relevant time of the inquiry

5 for the 15 employees? You have 16 employees when the

6 discrimination takes place. By the time the lawsuit is

7 filed, you've only got 14. Does it matter whether

8 that's called jurisdiction or going to the merits?

9 MR. PRENDERGAST: I -- I believe that the --

10 the case law has uniformly held that you look at the

11 time of the discrimination to determine the number of

12 employees.

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even -- even if it's

14 a question of jurisdiction.

15 MR. PRENDERGAST: Even if it's a question of

16 jurisdiction, yes, Your Honor.

17 And I do think ultimately, though, it does

18 matter because it does become a matter -- it doesn't

19 matter for the plaintiff. It doesn't matter for the

20 plaintiff whether or not it's a matter of subject

21 matter jurisdiction or a matter of the merits because

22 the bottom line is they're going to lose in either

23 event.

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It certainly matters for

25 plaintiffs in this situation.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. PRENDERGAST: In this particular --

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It certainly matters from

3 the defendant's point of view too. In many of these

4 cases, it's not clear whether the number 15 has been --

5 as in this case, you have delivery drivers. You have

6 owners whose wives are employed in the business.

7 MR. PRENDERGAST: And, Your Honor, and I

8 would urge that those kind of matters that need to be

9 addressed are best addressed by the court as opposed to

10 by a jury. I think to the matter of determining

11 whether or not someone is a -- is an independent

12 contractor --

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: From the -- from the point

14 of view of a defendant who thinks I'm going to fight

15 this case on the merits, but if I lose, I still have

16 this ace up my sleeve.

17 MR. PRENDERGAST: I just -- Your Honor, I

18 simply do not believe a defendant would generally do

19 that because, as I pointed out in my brief, the problem

20 with that is if I'm representing the defendant, all

21 right, and I'm going to defend my case on the merits

22 and I know I got this 15 employee question here, I go

23 to trial, let's suppose I win. I win at trial in

24 Federal court. Subject matter jurisdiction can be

25 raised by the plaintiff. Now, after I've won at trial,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the plaintiff stands up and says, oh, this court didn't

2 have subject matter jurisdiction. I get a do-over.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That sounds like a good

4 reason why a court should think long and hard about

5 categorizing this as a question of subject matter

6 jurisdiction.

7 MR. PRENDERGAST: Your Honor, but again, I --

8 I simply don't believe that that's going to be a

9 problem that's going to come up. I think the

10 importance of -- of categorizing this as subject matter

11 jurisdiction is to avoid -- among other things, is

12 adding another complicating factor to a jury trial

13 because, if you make this a matter of the merits now --

14 counsel for petitioner describes in his brief extended

15 hearings to determine the number of employees. We're

16 now -- if you make it part -- just a part of the

17 merits, now before you can get to the actual issue of

18 discrimination, a jury is going to have to sit through

19 and try to decide how many employees there were.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it would be

21 simultaneous. The jury -- the jury would have that

22 question. Didn't I understand the attorney for the

23 United States to say this is typical of what juries

24 decide, was this person an independent contractor or an

25 employee?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. PRENDERGAST: Your Honor, I -- I heard

2 that argument as well. All I can say is given the

3 number of factors that are laid out under, for example,

4 the Fifth Circuit law to determine whether or not

5 somebody is an independent contractor or an employee,

6 that seems to me to be more like the function of a

7 judge than a jury because it's a matter of balancing of

8 the relevant factors.

10 Prendergast.

15 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16 MR. SCHWARTZ: If there are no additional

17 questions, I -- I have nothing further.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think -- do you think

19 it's possible that -- that Indian tribes could be

20 jurisdictional but an employer couldn't? I mean, it

21 seems to me the two the questions are quite different.

22 An Indian tribe is always an Indian tribe. Right?

23 And you're -- you're excluding -- just as a prosecutor

24 is always a prosecutor. You're excluding a whole

25 category of people. But you're -- you're not excluding

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 a category of employers here, are you? Because it's a

2 -- it's a factual question, whether at the time of the

3 alleged offense, the particular company was employing

4 more than 15 people. It isn't that this company

5 forever has immunity.

6 MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes, I agree with that.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're -- you're not

8 arguing for the Indian tribes here.

9 MR. SCHWARTZ: As -- well, my -- I leave that

10 to other people.

11 (Laughter.)

12 MR. SCHWARTZ: But the -- I could -- in

13 answer to that question, I can see an interesting

14 scenario where a plaintiff working for a casino on an

15 Indian tribe, there might be a question of who the

16 actual employer is. And -- and that could come up and

17 that would certainly involve some litigation.

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you if the

19 practice of law has returned to normal in New Orleans?

20 MR. SCHWARTZ: No. It's -- it's a struggle

21 somewhat for jury pools. The State court in

22 particular, because it only covers Orleans Parish, is

23 -- is really struggling with pulling in jurors. The

24 Federal courts have a larger number of parishes to draw

25 from.
