1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:07 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument next this morning in Case 09-1159, the Board of 5 Trustees of Stanford v. Roche Molecular Systems. 6 Mr. Ayer. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. AYER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 10 may it please the Court: 11 The Bayh-Dole Act sets forth a comprehensive 12 disposition of rights in inventions made by nonprofit 13 organizations and small business organizations under 14 Federal funding agreements. That disposition 15 specifically defines the rights of inventors and it puts 16 them in the third position behind the contractor, the 17 nonprofit contractor, and behind the government, and 18 specifically says that the inventor may only receive 19 rights -- that is to say, take title -- when the -- when 20 the contractor has declined to take title or defaulted 21 in some respect, and the government itself has -- has 22 likewise declined to take title. 23 In this case Roche's sole claim rests on an 24 assignment from an inventor who was at that time I think 25 without question a Stanford employee who was working on

1 a project under a Federal funding agreement. 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What if the inventor had 3 not been an employee? If it had been an independent 4 contractor who was working in combination with the 5 university, how does this automatic vesting - 6 MR. AYER: Well, Your Honor, the act deals 7 specifically with independent contractors, and -- the 8 regulations at least do. And they indicate that the - 9 that the contractor in that instance, if in fact working 10 on a Federally funded project, would step into the shoes 11 of the contractor. But I don't believe it would affect 12 the outcome in terms of whether it would be a Bayh-Dole 13 invention. 14 The -- the critical fact here is that the 15 inventor was working on a project that was already 16 funded, his work at Cetus was part of that project. And 17 then that result was - 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That seems to be a 19 factual dispute, so maybe you can be clear on that. 20 According to Cetus or Roche, at the time that this 21 scientist came to Cetus to work, there was no Federal 22 funding; that that Federal funding for this project, the 23 Stanford project, came about after the scientist had 24 spent his 9 months at Cetus. At least that's the 25 picture that -- that they draw, that the Federal -- that
4

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 they got their assignment from the scientist at a time 2 when there was no Federally funded project. 3 MR. AYER: That's what they say, Your Honor, 4 and I would submit that is plainly not correct. We deal 5 with this at pages 21 and 22 of our yellow brief, and we 6 specifically talk about the fact -- there's several 7 critical facts here. One is that the article which was 8 written about the work at Cetus, the JID article at page 9 135 of the joint appendix, specifically has a footnote 10 indicating that the work reported on -- that is the work 11 at Cetus on the assay -- was funded by the two specific 12 grants in issue. 13 Dr. Merigan, who is the head of the lab at 14 Stanford that Dr. Holodniy worked in, talks in his 15 declaration at 98 and 99 of the joint appendix - 16 specifically talks about how Dr. Holodniy's work was 17 part of the AIDS research center at Stanford and part of 18 an AIDS clinical trial at Stanford, and all of that work 19 was federally funded. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just -- just as a 21 hypothetical, suppose -- suppose it was as Justice 22 Ginsburg suggested; or indeed suppose this individual 23 even before he was employed by Stanford at all, much 24 less employed by a Stanford project funded by the 25 Federal Government, entered into this kind of an
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 agreement with somebody that he had been working for. 2 How -- how would it - 3 MR. AYER: Well, I think you have to look 4 very carefully at the facts, and I don't want to speak 5 loosely and categorically about the facts, but what - 6 what I will say is that in a situation where -- and this 7 is very clearly true -- in a situation where prior work 8 is done by persons who are, to start with a clearer set 9 of facts, not affiliated with the university, and 10 they -- let's say that person conceives of an invention, 11 and that later the university takes that conception of 12 an invention and reduces it to practice. The conception 13 by a person who is not a university employee, if -- if 14 there's no university person involved in the conception, 15 then it can't be an invention of the contractor, because 16 you can't be an inventor without being part of the 17 conception. 18 So that's a variation on Your Honor's -- on 19 Your Honor's question, but it's a -- it's a clear 20 example where Bayh-Dole would not apply. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: How does that change when 22 you -- when you alter the hypothetical so that he was 23 already an employee of Stanford, but was not working as 24 an employee of Stanford when he was at this other 25 company? You could still say that -- that Stanford was
6

1 not the inventor. 2 MR. AYER: Well, you would -- you -- I think 3 you are now in a zone where one of the things that has 4 to be considered is the equitable character of any 5 assignment of a future interest, that is to say a future 6 invention. Because if in fact what was assigned was, as 7 here, the possibility that there might at some future 8 time be an invention, then equitable considerations come 9 into play; and one of the equitable considerations we 10 think the one that is of paramount significance, is the 11 fact that the Congress of the United States has said in 12 the context of Bayh-Dole that when the United States 13 invests money in research, it wants certain things to 14 happen that are very carefully set out in the -- in the 15 Bayh-Dole Act. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you tell me, assume 17 no Federal act, let's just talk about two -- or parties 18 that are not involved with the Federal Government. 19 Inventor agrees to assign to A; then inventor - 20 inventor in fact assigns to B; then A gets the patent - 21 MR. AYER: Well, it depends what's assigned, 22 Your Honor. If -- if B is a bona fide to purchaser 23 under 35 U.S.C. 261, then B would prevail. If B is not 24 a bona fide purchaser, and that can only apply under 25 261, where you are dealing with an assignment in law of
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 a patent or a patent application, then I think you are 2 in the difficult zone where there are two competing 3 interests in the future possibility of an invention; and 4 I don't know that I can, without knowing all the facts, 5 even intelligently try to tell you what would end up 6 happening. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case, if you do 8 not prevail on your principal argument, have you 9 preserved the point that the assignment to Cetus was 10 contrary to public policy? 11 MR. AYER: I think we have, Your Honor. I 12 think -- essentially I would say, frankly that that 13 is - 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the court of appeals 15 didn't seem to discuss that. 16 MR. AYER: Well, I think that is at the 17 heart of -- of our -- of our core argument and of the 18 government's argument, and it is that, as the trial 19 court here held, and as we've said in our brief several 20 times, the inventor, because he is working here at the 21 time of the assignment on a Federally funded project as 22 an employee of Stanford University, is essentially 23 working on something covered by Bayh-Dole; and being 24 covered by Bayh-Dole means that he lacks the power to 25 transfer title to this future invention to someone else

1 because the statute has already spoken for it. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ayer, it seems the 3 Federal Circuit emphasized a distinction between the 4 scientist saying "I will assign," which was the language 5 used in the agreement with Stanford, and "I hereby do 6 assign," and it seems that that was critical to the - 7 to the Federal Circuit's decision. 8 They say -- they cite a whole bunch of 9 cases. The suggestion seems to be that if Stanford had 10 said "I hereby do assign," there would be no case 11 because Stanford would have been first in time. 12 MR. AYER: Well, one interesting thing about 13 that discussion is that the very first case that we know 14 anything about, that we're aware of, making that 15 distinction and relying upon the immediate effect of an 16 assignment using the words "I hereby assign," was the 17 FilmTec case in 1991. That was 2 years after the events 18 in this case, so how was Stanford supposed to know that 19 that fine distinction was going to be made? 20 We think the critical -- the critical issue 21 here is whether the inventor, while working on a 22 federally funded project as an employee of the 23 contractor -- and there's no doubt that his work at 24 Cetus was part of his Stanford research. All you have 25 to do is look at pages 16a to 18a of the petition

1 appendix for the court of appeals decision or pages 62a 2 and 69a for the district court opinion. It's perfectly 3 clear that everyone knew he came to Cetus to advance his 4 work on his Stanford research, which was in fact funded, 5 as we show at pages 21 and 22. And the Bayh-Dole - 6 JUSTICE ALITO: What have universities been 7 doing for the last 30 years? Have they been proceeding 8 on the assumption that title to inventions vested in 9 them automatically or have they been very careful about 10 getting assignments from all of their employees? 11 MR. AYER: Universities, and -- and I think 12 everybody engaged in research, is generally careful. 13 They have policies in place to get assignments, and 14 there are lots of reasons why that would be true. It 15 was true before the Bayh-Dole Act. It's a -- it's a 16 wise and prudent practice to have an understanding with 17 your employees about who is going to own what. 18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do those policies ever 19 distinguish between Federally funded projects and 20 Non-Federally funded projects? 21 MR. AYER: I don't -- I don't know about the 22 universe of them. I -- I know that the -- that the 23 Stanford policy in this case relevant at this time was a 24 policy that indicated employees could retain title in 25 many instances, but not where Federal law, applicable
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 law, says that they can't retain title; and in that 2 sense they do. 3 But those policies I think are very 4 clearly in virtually every case I know anything about 5 policies that are signed by an employee pretty much the 6 day they walk in the door, as I think was the case here 7 with Dr. Holodniy back in 1988. And it's a general 8 understanding of what the expectations are, and I don't 9 want to here be heard to say at all that we think this 10 is an unwise thing or that it isn't a good thing that it 11 goes on. It's a very good thing that it goes on, 12 because people need to understand what the situation is. 13 The critical issue is whether, in the event 14 that that fails to happen for some reason or that there 15 is a slip-up here where a fellow going to visit 16 somewhere on the first day there has something put under 17 his nose called a visitor's confidentiality agreement 18 which he happens to sign, and down in paragraph 2 it 19 talks about assigning away everything that he ever might 20 do as a consequence of this. 21 The point is that in that situation you 22 can't have the interest of the United States, which is 23 the critical paramount interest in this case -- I want 24 to make that very clear. It's the interest in the 25 United States when it spends millions and billions of
11

1 dollars on research in having that research handled in a 2 certain way, having the fruits of it dealt with in a 3 certain way and having it go where Congress says it 4 should go. Now, the critical - 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Don't you think that 6 the - 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in theory -- I 8 mean, you're cloaking yourself in the interests of the 9 United States, but we're going to hear from their lawyer 10 shortly. 11 MR. AYER: Right. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you ever have 13 different arrangements with respect to the assignments 14 depending upon who the researcher is? I mean, I suppose 15 -- I would have supposed there are very prominent 16 researchers that you would like to have at Stanford, and 17 you would be willing to negotiate less than a 18 requirement of full assignment of their inventions in 19 order to -- to get that person there. 20 MR. AYER: I don't know -- I wouldn't tell 21 you categorically - 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, 23 you'd be willing -- wouldn't you be willing to sell the 24 interests of the United States down the river to get - 25 to advance your interests?
12

1 MR. AYER: Well, we would not, I think, be 2 willing, and I wouldn't think anybody would be willing, 3 to break the law. And we would submit that that's 4 what's going on here. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I thought 6 the law meant that the United States got whatever 7 interest the contractor got, right? And if -- it 8 doesn't say what the contractor can or can't do with 9 respect to the employees it has. 10 MR. AYER: The statute -- the statute 11 defines a universe of covered cases which are inventions 12 of the contractor, which we think the other side uses 13 those words to argue that -- that inventions of the 14 contractor are only the ones the -- the contractor 15 already owns by virtue of - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Plus the word "retained," 17 don't forget that, too. 18 MR. AYER: Right. Those two provisions are 19 essentially their argument for narrowing the universe of 20 inventions that is covered. 21 And I want to just say at the outset, the 22 critical thing about narrowing the universe of 23 inventions covered is that it narrows the universe of 24 inventions in which the government's rights to, number 25 one, itself receive title under several provisions of
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the act; number two, itself to enforce a whole series of 2 requirements under 202(c)(4), (5), (6), (7) and a 3 variety of other provisions, to itself march in and do 4 things. 5 When you define out of that category 6 instances where inventions exist and were produced with 7 Federal money, then you're limiting the coverage of the 8 government's interests. But on the two provisions at 9 issue, we think clearly they do not mean what the other 10 side says they mean. The word "invention of" someone is 11 conventionally understood, if you hear the light bulb 12 was an invention of Thomas Edison, you don't think 13 Thomas Edison owns the patent; you think he invented it. 14 The same thing is true. Even though - 15 JUSTICE ALITO: There are two things that 16 cut very strongly against your argument. I mean, there 17 are many things that cut in favor of it, but the two 18 things that seem to me to cut pretty strongly against 19 your argument are: First, that it has long been the 20 rule that inventors have title to their patents 21 initially, even if they make those inventions while 22 working for somebody else. 23 And the second is that you are relying on a 24 provision that says that the nonprofit organization may 25 elect to retain title, which means hold onto a title,
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that the -- the organization already has. There's just 2 no accepted definition of the word "retain" that 3 corresponds to the meaning that you want to assign to 4 that word. "Retain" does not mean obtain. 5 MR. AYER: Thank you, Your Honor. Can I 6 answer? Basically, what I would say is, on the first 7 point: You're quite correct, obviously, that that's the 8 general rule, that inventors receive title. However, 9 just in this case, in this fact pattern, the array of 10 so-called vesting statutes that predated the Bayh-Dole 11 Act throughout the 30 years in between are statutes that 12 specifically, in most instances without any discussion 13 of an assignment, simply vested title directly in the 14 United States. So Congress clearly had the power to do 15 that, and they did it, and no one ever seriously argued 16 that they couldn't. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: But this isn't vesting it 18 in the United States. This is -- this is speaking of 19 the -- the university retaining title. If -- if the 20 government was going to make such a huge change from 21 normal patent law where the inventor owns his invention 22 until he assigns it to his employer, why wasn't that set 23 forth clearly? All they needed was one paragraph. 24 MR. AYER: Well, Your Honor - 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: It says when you're working
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 on a -- on a government-funded project, you have no 2 right to your invention as an -- as an employee. It 3 automatically vests in the -- in the university. I 4 would have expected that to be set forth very clearly 5 if -- if they were making such an immense change in 6 patent law. 7 MR. AYER: Well, Your Honor, I would take 8 exception to how immense it is, given the prior history 9 in which the government simply took title to these very 10 same inventions. 11 But on the issue of the meaning of the word 12 "retain," that's actually a word that has a lot of 13 potential connotations. The one thing we can be sure of 14 here without any doubt is that it doesn't mean that you 15 had to have ownership before, because in section 202(d) 16 of the act, the act specifically talks about the 17 inventor's opportunity to itself be considered for 18 retention of title, and everyone agrees that that phrase 19 is one that never applies when the inventor already has 20 title. So "retain" doesn't mean that. 21 We would submit that what the word "retain" 22 means is - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I lost you. Go 24 over that again. 25 MR. AYER: Okay. 202(d) -
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, where is that? 2 MR. AYER: 202(d) is -- is the section - 3 where is it in the -- okay. It is -- it is on page 9a. 4 And it says that if a contractor does not elect to 5 retain title -- 9a of the blue brief, I'm sorry. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Got you. 7 MR. AYER: -- "does not elect to retain 8 title to a subject invention in cases subject to this 9 section, the Federal agency may consider and, after 10 consultation with the contractor, grant a request for 11 retention of rights by the inventor." 12 On 38 of the red brief, you will see the 13 other side vehemently arguing that that only applies 14 when the inventor doesn't have title to start with. So 15 you can't have "retain" mean one thing in one place and 16 place -- and one thing in the other. 17 Your Honor, if I could, I would like to save 18 the rest of my time. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 20 Mr. Stewart. 21 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L.

1 As the Chief Justice's question suggests, 2 although Stanford and the government's interests are 3 aligned in this case, that won't invariably be so, and 4 the government has perhaps different reasons for 5 supporting the same position that Stanford is 6 supporting. 7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stewart, could I ask you 8 just a factual question? 9 When the Federal Government contracts with 10 universities or other nonprofits, does it require those 11 universities to get assignments from their employees? 12 And if so, how? 13 MR. STEWART: The government-wide regulation 14 that -- which was promulgated by the Department of 15 Commerce and which identifies certain things that should 16 be in the funding agreements, it does not require an 17 assignment of title from the university's employees. 18 The regulation does require the university 19 to make assurance -- give assurances that it has 20 contractual obligations from its employees to cooperate 21 in filing the documents necessary to process a completed 22 patent application. But that would be necessary - 23 JUSTICE KAGAN: So why doesn't the Federal 24 Government just require assignments from employees to 25 the university?
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. STEWART: Well, under our theory - 2 first, under our theory it wouldn't be necessary, 3 because the statute itself would give the university 4 title. And second, under Respondent's theory I think 5 there is a substantial doubt whether it would be 6 permissible. That is, Respondent's vision of the 7 Bayh-Dole Act is that Congress imposed elaborate 8 requirements on inventions as to which the contractor 9 has obtained title from the researcher, but that 10 Congress left entirely to private ordering, was 11 indifferent as to whether the contractor took title in 12 the first instance. 13 And if that view of the statute were 14 accepted, there would at least be a substantial doubt 15 whether the Commerce Department could promulgate 16 regulations that would validly require the contractor to 17 do something that, in Respondent's view, Congress left 18 to private ordering. 19 Now, I don't want to argue that point too 20 vigorously, because certainly, if this Court holds that 21 assignments from the inventors are required, we would 22 like to have the opportunity to require the contractor 23 to get them, but it isn't clear to me how you would get 24 there if Respondent's view of the statute were accepted. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.

1 Why can't the Federal government just say: We're not 2 going to fund your project unless you get assignments of 3 inventions by all the employees working on it? What's 4 the problem? 5 MR. STEWART: We would certainly like to 6 have the opportunity to do that, but to use an analogy, 7 the Bayh-Dole Act is triggered by voluntary choices of 8 small businesses and nonprofits to accept Federal funds. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: And by -- and by the 10 Federal 0 voluntary decision to provide funds. I mean, 11 certainly you can condition your grant of funds on that. 12 I -- I really don't see the problem. 13 MR. STEWART: If -- certainly if this Court, 14 as I say, holds that the -- an assignment from the 15 inventor is required, then we would like to be able to 16 have regulations that would require that to be done. As 17 I say - 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does the -- as a 19 practical matter, when a university is seeking a patent, 20 doesn't it have to identify the inventors and get 21 their -- proof of their assignment before it can claim 22 ownership of the patent? 23 MR. STEWART: Well, typically it would -- it 24 would certainly have to identify the inventors on the 25 patent application, and typically the university

1 would -- whether it felt an assignment was legally 2 required or not, it would attempt to - 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a different 4 question than mine. 5 MR. STEWART: It would - 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does the Patent Office 7 require the assignment for purposes of showing ownership 8 of the patent? 9 MR. STEWART: Not -- in most cases, but not 10 necessarily. There's a provision of the Patent Act, 35 11 U.S.C. 118, which says that if an inventor refuses to 12 execute an assignment or cannot be found after 13 reasonable diligence, a person to whom the patent 14 application has been assigned or to whom the inventor 15 has promised to assign it, or some other person with a 16 sufficient proprietary interest in the invention, can 17 file its own patent application. It will identify the 18 inventor as the inventor, and it will provide 19 documentation that establishes its own interest in the 20 invention. 21 And this is the kind of thing that we might 22 in some instances have to do with respect to Federal 23 employees. That is, there's an executive order that 24 says basically as a condition of Federal employment, if 25 you conceive -- if you create or conceive an invention
21

1 on the job, it -- the Federal Government is entitled to 2 take title to it. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask -- that all 4 sounds to me like there's an assumption about 5 assignments, even in the patent law, that you -- the 6 section that you just recited to me says a promise to 7 assign will get you an assignment if the inventor won't 8 give it to you. 9 MR. STEWART: It could be a -- I mean, there 10 are two different things. It could be a promise to 11 assign at the formation of the employment arrangement, 12 where the employee is not -- doesn't necessarily have in 13 mind any particular invention, but he exercises a 14 contractual commitment to assign to the -- to the 15 employer at a later date. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that what we're 17 dealing with in this case? I mean, there was a -- an 18 agreement, a standard Stanford agreement, that said I 19 will assign any -- any patent. 20 MR. STEWART: He agreed to that, and he also 21 agreed that he would not enter into any other 22 arrangement that placed him in conflict with the 23 agreement he had made - 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So why isn't that the 25 beginning and end of this case? I mean you -- there are
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 important questions presented. But the Federal Circuit 2 said everything turns on the difference between "I will 3 assign" and "I hereby assign." Cetus would have come 4 second in time, therefore would not have prevailed over 5 Stanford, but for, except, the Federal Circuit said, one 6 is a future conveyance and one is an immediate 7 conveyance. You know - 8 MR. STEWART: Leaving aside the question of 9 whether that is right or wrong is a matter of contract 10 law, our view is it was not within Stanford's power to 11 essentially convey to the inventor or allow the inventor 12 to retain title, and that's clear in a couple of 13 different respects. The provision that Mr. Ayer was 14 reading, section 202(d), says that if the contractor 15 does not elect to retain title, then the inventor can 16 make a request for retention of title, which the agency 17 will consider after consultation with the contractor. 18 So the statute doesn't say to the contractor - 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but Justice 20 Ginsburg's question, and I have the same concern, is 21 that why can't we resolve this case in a simple way? 22 What you're asking for, based on submissions to us of 23 amici, of amicus briefs, means a very great change in 24 how -- how -- how patents are held. If we can resolve 25 this case on a simple contract basis, why not do it?

1 MR.

The one - 9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stewart, do you know, is 10 this a Stanford-specific problem or is it a more general 11 problem? In other words, are there many universities 12 that have agreements like Stanford's that would be 13 subject to the Federal Circuit's ruling? Or is this 14 just an example of one university that unfortunately has 15 a bad agreement? 16 MR. STEWART: I think there are probably a 17 lot of universities that use this language, and indeed, 18 as one of the amicus briefs points out, it's very 19 natural to distinguish between a present assignment and 20 a promise to assign in the future with respect to an 21 invention that now exists. It seems a little ethereal 22 to distinguish between a present assignment of an 23 invention that has not yet been created and an agreement 24 to assign that in the future. 25 Now, certainly universities could change

1 their contracts if that was what was necessary. I think 2 one of the concerns that the government has, and this 3 was hinted at by the Chief Justice's question, is that 4 we're -- we're worried not just about what can be done 5 to universities, but what universities could do to us. 6 That is, it's standard university practice to say 7 employees agree to assign their inventions to the 8 university, and the two parties will divide the 9 royalties; and if that is done, then even under 10 Respondent's view it becomes a subject invention; and 11 the university's commercialization of the invention is 12 subject to all the requirements of Bayh-Dole. The 13 government - 14 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it the case that at 15 least some components, possibly many components, of the 16 Federal Government for the last 30 years have been 17 proceeding on that assumption that assignments were 18 necessary? The grants here were -- were from NIH, isn't 19 that right? 20 MR. STEWART: Right. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: And one of the amicus briefs 22 points out that the NIH compliance guidelines say by law 23 an inventor has initial ownership of invention; however, 24 awardee organizations are required by the Bayh-Dole Act 25 to have in place employee -- employee agreements
25

1 requiring an inventor to assign or give ownership of an 2 invention to the organization - 3 MR. STEWART: -- well, the -- the NIH 4 document is internally inconsistent, because it says at 5 the beginning that title passes automatically to the 6 university, but then, as you say, it states later on 7 that an assignment is required, but that the contractor 8 is required to get it. 9 And I think some people have proceeded on 10 that assumption because it never -- so long as 11 assignments were in place and were enforceable, it never 12 really mattered whether they were needed. 13 But to continue my answer to Justice Kagan, 14 I wanted to point out, under Respondent's theory, 15 universities could make a conscious, calculated decision 16 that, rather than obtain an assignment for their 17 inventors, they would simply agree with the inventor 18 that royalties would be split in -- in the same manner 19 as previously, but that the inventor would retain title 20 and, perhaps with the assistance of the university's 21 technology transfer office, would negotiate with 22 commercial entities. And the effect would be to 23 contract around Bayh-Dole; commercialization could occur 24 without complying with any of the prerequisites. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

1 Stewart. 2 Mr. Fleming. 3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING 4 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 5 MR. FLEMING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 6 please the Court: 7 The Bayh-Dole Act had the laudable objective 8 of taking inventions off of government shelves and 9 putting them into the market, and it succeeded; but it 10 did not change the long-standing rule dating back to 11 this Court's decisions in Hapgood and Dubilier that 12 title to an invention vests in the inventor, subject to 13 assignment, not in the inventor's employer. We submit 14 that, in light of this long-settled rule which Congress 15 nowhere purported to change, the Act should be given its 16 straightforward meaning. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a reason 18 that the Federal Government can't just say, from now on 19 we're not going to give any money to Stanford or anybody 20 else until they have an agreement making clear that the 21 inventor is going to ensure sure that title rests with 22 the university, which then triggers the Bayh-Dole Act? 23 MR. FLEMING: Mr. Chief Justice, I know of 24 no reason why the Federal Government cannot make that 25 requirement. In fact, in the case of FilmTec v.
27

1 Hydranautics, a Federal Circuit decision, the decision 2 reflects that the Federal agency there did exactly that. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you have no 4 problem -- I mean, Mr. Stewart is being careful for his 5 client, but you're comfortable with the idea that the 6 government could impose that, even though there's 7 nothing in the statute that requires it, and even though 8 somebody could argue that the statute's somewhat 9 inconsistent with it, in the -- in the sense that it 10 wants to promote commercialization. 11 MR. FLEMING: As far as I know that has 12 never been litigated, but I know of no reason why a 13 Federal agency couldn't say to a contractor, we want to 14 be absolutely certain that the assumption that underlay 15 not only Bayh-Dole contracting, but contracting going 16 all the way back to Attorney General Biddle's report in 17 1947, that everyone assumed was in place, which is an 18 assignment from an employee, whether it's a Federally 19 funded invention or a privately funded invention - 20 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, though - 21 MR. FLEMING: -- would go to the contractor. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's where I 23 exactly am. I mean, the -- the brief that I found very, 24 very interesting is that filed by the Association of 25 American Universities and the Advancement For Science
28

1 and the Council on Education, and they seem to take the 2 line that you are -- I don't know how far you want to 3 pursue it. 4 They say the strongest analogy is with 5 government employees, and if you look at government 6 employees the basic rule is, the Federal Government paid 7 for it, they should have the invention. And the way 8 they do it is not to deny the employee the right to have 9 the invention, but they insist upon an assignment, 10 assignment of an exclusive license. 11 And there are cases which are cited here 12 that suggest that, even if the employee tries to run his 13 way around that and simply goes and before the 14 government can get it assigns the interest to a third 15 party, that that third party assignment is void as a 16 matter of public policy; and that the assignment to the 17 government of the exclusive right is valid as a matter 18 of law, a legal implication from the executive order in 19 the circumstance. 20 That brings me back to where Justice 21 Ginsburg was, and Justice Kennedy. The analogy is so 22 strong. The government has paid for it. There is a 23 statute here that really seems to assume, though not 24 explicitly say, that the universities will have title - 25 that we simply copy what happened in this other area and

1 say that an effort to assign by the employee in 2 contravention of what this statute takes as its basic 3 assumption, and a contract, is void as a matter of 4 public policy, because the exclusive license is assumed 5 to be assumed -- to be assigned to the university, 6 though I don't need the second part; for this case, the 7 first part suffices. 8 MR. FLEMING: Justice Breyer, let me begin 9 with the assumption that I agree underlies the AAU brief 10 about the situation with respect to government 11 employees. Actually, I think the situation of 12 government employees supports our side, because, as this 13 Court ruled in Dubilier, just because the government 14 pays for an invention does not mean that it 15 automatically owns it. 16 In Dubilier, there were employees of the 17 Bureau of Standards who came up with particular 18 inventions and they got patents on them, and the 19 government said: We own that because these are 20 government employees. And this Court ruled that's not 21 the case. Government employees are in no different 22 position from employees of private entities with respect 23 to ownership of their inventions. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that before the 25 executive order or after?

1 MR. FLEMING: The executive order simply 2 says that there can be regulations where the employment 3 agreement, which is essentially regulatory between the 4 government agency and the individual, can result in an 5 assignment from the individual to the government, just 6 as the same applies in private industry. Employees sign 7 either an agreement to assign, as happened with 8 Dr. Holodniy and Stanford here, or, as happened with 9 Cetus, there's a present assignment of future expected 10 interest. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the 12 problem with - 13 MR. FLEMING: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you finished 15 answering Justice Breyer? 16 MR. FLEMING: What I was going to say is 17 that there was no rule of automatic vesting of title, 18 which is what - 19 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I understand that. 20 MR. FLEMING: There's a requirement of an 21 assignment. And the regulations actually give the 22 government employee the right to refuse to assign an 23 invention to the government, and there are appeal 24 procedures, as set out in many of the regulations. We 25 quote the Air Force regulations in our brief, but there

1 are many others, where it's possible that the employee 2 will wind up retaining his rights to an invention that 3 was made, even though he's a government employee. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: And if the employee seeks 5 to assign to a third party in contravention of his 6 agreement, rules and regulations, et cetera, what 7 happens to that assignment? 8 MR. FLEMING: Well, there can be -- it 9 depends on the facts, Justice Breyer. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: The facts are that he was 11 supposed to give it to - 12 MR. FLEMING: There could be a situation 13 where there's an order to reassign, as there was in the 14 Heinemann case. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: No, there's no -- what 16 there is, is an agreement with the government that says 17 any invention you will assign to the government. That's 18 the agreement. 19 MR. FLEMING: Uh-huh. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: And now, in violation of 21 that agreement, he assigns it to a third party. What 22 happens to that assignment? 23 MR. FLEMING: The question will be whether 24 that assignment can be void under ordinary equitable 25 principles, just as it said here.

FLEMING: I'm not sure which case Your 8 Honor is referring to. If it's the Heinemann case - 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you have -- you have 10 here L-I v. Montgomery, Li v. Montgomery - 11 MR.

Montgomery is the unpublished 17 decision of the D.C. Circuit, which has less than a 18 sentence of discussion of this. The only one in which 19 there -- this was actually covered in any respect I 20 think is the Heinemann decision in the Federal Circuit. 21 But there, there was no assignment to a third party. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How - 23 MR.

1 reason that, under the Bayh-Dole Act, whose intent was 2 to protect the government's interests after it's funded 3 the discovery or implementation of an invention, that 4 Congress would have ever wanted the university and the 5 inventor to be able to circumvent the act by failing to 6 secure an assignment? 7 MR. FLEMING: The purpose of the act, 8 Justice Sotomayor, was to clarify the relationship 9 between the contractor on the one hand and the Federal 10 government on the other on the basis of uniform 11 Federal - 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But frankly, every act 13 before this one -- actually, the IPA -- required that 14 the contractor seek assignments from inventors. Why 15 would this act omit such a critical term if it didn't 16 intend to vest title in the contractor? 17 MR. FLEMING: The answer, Justice Sotomayor, 18 is given by the IPA, which is: There was no need for 19 such a requirement. Universities had shown that they 20 were perfectly able under existing law - 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The government just 22 said -- if we say that the contractor and the inventor 23 can do what they want, what sane university wouldn't 24 enter into agreements with employees letting the 25 employees retain title to their inventions and just

1 sharing royalties thereafter? It wouldn't make any 2 sense for universities to do what you're saying -- get 3 assignments -- because they could just continue taking 4 the bulk of the royalties. 5 MR. FLEMING: If that were to happen, 6 Justice Sotomayor, the remedy that Mr. Stewart kept in 7 his pocket, which is that the agency would say to the 8 university: You're not getting any more Federal money 9 until we are assured that the assumption that has 10 underlaid Federal contracting since 1947 and before is 11 in place, namely, that - 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that might lead 13 to the same thing that the Bayh-Dole Act was intended to 14 get away from, which is a variety of different 15 arrangements across the vast array of government 16 agencies, because they will have differing degrees of 17 interest, differing leverage with respect to what they 18 insist on from the different contractors. 19 MR. FLEMING: Well, Congress, Mr. Chief 20 Justice, in the Bayh-Dole Act, was considered with a 21 particular type of uncertainty. It didn't do anything 22 and everything that could be argued to create 23 uncertainty in tech licensing. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- are you 25 aware of situations where the universities enter into
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 different types of arrangements with different types of 2 professors and researchers? 3 MR. FLEMING: Certainly. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Presumably some of 5 them have greater degree of leverage than others and can 6 say: Look, you've got to make sure I get this much of 7 the royalties, and I'm only going to give you that much. 8 MR. FLEMING: Well, certainly there are 9 different approaches, and that is the system that 10 Bayh-Dole left in place, which is that the relationship 11 between the contractor and the inventor would be 12 governed under ordinary patent contract law principles. 13 MIT and Caltech, for instance -- I'm sorry, I was going 14 to answer the question with examples, but - 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, go ahead. 16 MR. FLEMING: MIT and Caltech get present 17 assignments of future interest. We cite those policies 18 in the brief. Stanford, for its own reasons - 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The whole thing that was 20 wrong here is that Stanford, instead of drafting the 21 agreement "I agree to assign," should have said "I 22 hereby assign" and then there would be no case. Is 23 that -- the Cetus agreement said "I hereby assign," and 24 the Federal Circuit said for that reason, even though it 25 was second in time, it takes precedence. Stanford just
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 said "I will assign." 2 So if Stanford had instead used exactly the 3 formula that Cetus used -- "I agree to assign and hereby 4 do assign" -- would you have any case? 5 MR. FLEMING: The question presented before 6 this Court would not be presented. There would be other 7 arguments we might have as to whether that earlier 8 assignment was enforceable as against Cetus in light of 9 representations that were made at the time Dr. Holodniy 10 came in. 11 But Justice Ginsburg, your question is -- is 12 sound, which is that there is this distinction between 13 an agreement to assign and a present assignment of 14 future expected interests. That has been the law for 15 decades. There are plenty of settled expectations based 16 on that. That has not been challenged, not in the 17 petition for certiorari, not in the opening brief of 18 Stanford, and it only comes up in a footnote on the 19 penultimate page of the reply brief. So I would 20 submit - 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if the Cetus agreement 22 that came second in time had said "I will assign," then 23 again, you would have no case? 24 MR. FLEMING: The question presented here 25 would not arise, because the only effective assignment
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of the invention would have been the assignment that 2 Stanford got subsequently from all three coinventors and 3 filed in the Patent Office in 1995, recognizing that it 4 couldn't simply say: Bayh-Dole Act vests title in 5 Stanford, but rather, we need an assignment, and it got 6 one. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We -- we have a number of 8 sample clauses in this record, and some say "I will 9 assign." Some say "I hereby do assign." The notion 10 that the -- that answer, who is it who loses, should 11 turn on whether one drafter says "I agree to assign" and 12 the other says "I hereby assign" does seem very odd. 13 MR. FLEMING: That's a distinction, Justice 14 Ginsburg, that goes back to the Federal Circuit decision 15 in Arachnid by Judge Giles Rich, who is a notable 16 authority on the patent act. He relied on the Curtis 17 treatise from 1873. But if that were an issue that the 18 Court wished to reconsider, I think - 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that patent law or is it 20 regular contract law? Doesn't it apply in other fields 21 as well? I mean, I'm -- I'm not aware that this is a 22 peculiar doctrine applicable to patent law. 23 MR. FLEMING: No, not in particular. An 24 agreement to assign is specifically that. It's an 25 agreement to do an assignment in the future.
38

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: To do it in the future. If 2 somebody else gets an assignment before that agreement 3 is -- is executed, the assignment prevails. 4 MR. FLEMING: That's - 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then we're talking about 6 nonexistent property; property that may never, in fact, 7 exist? 8 MR. FLEMING: That comes from the FilmTec 9 decision, which relied on Justice Storey's decision in 10 Mitchell, and it's used, again, by universities like 11 Caltech and MIT that rely on the validity of a present 12 assignment of future expected interest. 13 I mean, I know that the issue of the 14 interpretation of agreements to assign was addressed in 15 the cert petition in ProStar v. IP Venture, which this 16 Court denied cert on three terms ago. But if this Court 17 were to wish to reconsider that doctrine, I would submit 18 it can be done in an appropriate case where there is an 19 amicus briefing on that issue. That's not been 20 considered here at all. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So in the future, the 22 universities would be protected against a third party 23 simply by changing the form of contract with their 24 employees to say "I hereby assign," so we would have no 25 continuing problem? Is that all this -

There might be other 4 problems - 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and then your clients 6 would be out there arguing, oh, but you, see you can't 7 assign a future interests in the fruits from black acre; 8 I mean, you can promise to do it, but black acre isn't 9 even around yet. And so when somebody ran in and got 10 those fruits, well, then now we have a fight; and in law 11 the second person wins, and in equity maybe the first 12 person can get an injunction. I don't know. But I 13 guess people would raise that kind of argument, wouldn't 14 they? 15 MR. FLEMING: The point, Justice Breyer, is 16 that all these questions are resolved in the exactly 17 same way when we're not talking about a federally funded 18 invention. The Bayh-Dole Act has nothing to say about 19 this. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: So if fact - 21 MR.

FLEMING: I don't think that's a fair 7 inference, Justice Breyer. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Because? 9 MR. FLEMING: The fact that this has not 10 happened at all in 30 years of the Bayh-Dole Act. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Because most people perhaps 12 thought that they had made a valid assignment. 13 MR. FLEMING: Well, in most situations there 14 will be a valid assignment, but the fact that Stanford 15 here did not get an effective assignment from Dr. 16 Holodniy is no reason to read the Bayh-Dole Act that 17 Congress did not intend to draft it. And - 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's just - 19 MR. FLEMING: -- it that it doesn't - 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it's not just 21 that there may or may not be an effective assignment. 22 The problem is you may get together, you the inventor 23 get together with the university and say, look, the one 24 -- we share an interest in making sure none of this goes 25 to the government. Why would we want to do that? So

1 you make an arrangement. 2 Your theory -- your theory is that whatever 3 the contractor gets is what the government can get and 4 nothing more, so the contractor and you work out a deal 5 to make sure that the contractor doesn't get the 6 invention or the patent, it just gets royalties. 7 MR. FLEMING: I think - 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they're happy 9 because they're -- the value of the patent is not 10 diluted by the fact that the government is going to be 11 doing something with it. 12 MR. FLEMING: I think in that situation, Mr. 13 Chief Justice, there would be other doctrines that the 14 government or a bona fide third-party purchaser could 15 invoke, including section 261 of the Patent Act or a 16 lawsuit for a reassignment, as is happening in Fenn v. 17 Yale or a - 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So at the end of the 19 day, though, your theory is that Congress passed a law 20 that could -- I guess this is Justice Breyer's point - 21 be easily circumvented not only by the inventor but by 22 the inventor and the contractor working together. 23 MR. FLEMING: It's not that it can be 24 circumvented. It's -- there are efforts, there are ways 25 in which if there is an inequitable assignment, it can
42

1 be attacked in equity. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's nothing 3 inequitable about it. It's a perfectly fair deal 4 between the university and the inventor. 5 Mr. Fleming: In that event the government 6 has all the remedies that Mr. Stewart was talking about. 7 As a matter of leverage, it could take the patent by 8 eminent domain, and just compensation might be quite low 9 if in fact it has funded all of the research. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: It could refuse to fund. 11 MR. FLEMING: Absolutely, Justice Scalia. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: It could refuse to fund 13 without a clear assignment upfront. 14 MR. FLEMING: That's quite right. What it 15 can't do is relitigate Dubilier and just say that 16 because we funded it, we own it. It doesn't make that 17 rule even for Federal employees. An assignment is 18 required. I mean, I think - 19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you have an explanation, 20 Mr. Fleming, of why it is that Congress left such a big 21 problem off the table? 22 MR. FLEMING: I - 23 JUSTICE KAGAN: In other words, clearly 24 Congress was thinking about how to protect the 25 government's interests with respect to these patents,
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and to say, well, we have these interests with respect 2 to patents that the university owns, but we don't have 3 those same interests with respect to patents that the 4 individual researcher owns, just seems bizarre. 5 MR. FLEMING: There is an explanation, 6 Justice Kagan. Which is that the universities had shown 7 they didn't need a vesting rule in order to get title 8 from their inventors, just the same as private industry 9 does not need a vesting rule to get title to 10 nonfederally funded inventions. This was something that 11 Attorney General Biddle in 1947 - 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Sorry. They -- they do. 13 I mean, the general rule is that the inventor owns the 14 patent. 15 MR. FLEMING: Correct, Justice Sotomayor. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And there -- there is 17 proof that they can go into court, an employer can go 18 into court and show that the inventor was hired for this 19 specific item and the law would presume or recognize the 20 employer's rights; but why would Congress leave all of 21 that up to the nature of the contract that the 22 university entered into with its inventors? 23 MR. FLEMING: That's precisely what happens 24 in the context of Federal employees, it's governed by 25 the employment relationship between the Federal

There was no need for a new - 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the -- but the 6 question I started with and Justice Kagan has picked up 7 on, why would Congress create this act relying on 8 assignments and not have a provision requiring one? 9 Nothing in the Act, nothing in its regulations, nowhere 10 is there a requirement that Federal contractors seek 11 assignments. 12 MR. FLEMING: Because there was no need for 13 such a requirement. The universities and industry were 14 able to do it without the vesting rule. 15 I think in order for Stanford to prevail 16 here, to Justice Scalia's point, the Court would have to 17 be satisfied that -- that Congress worked a highly 18 transformative change in the law of patent ownership and 19 assignment and did it in a very obscure and indirect 20 way. It didn't do it through an express provision, like 21 it does in section 201 of the Copyright Act, which 22 expressly says that an employer can be treated like an 23 author for purposes of the copyright. It didn't do it 24 in the way that was done under the IPAs, which is it was 25 left entirely up to private contract.

1 Supposedly it created this brand-new vesting 2 rule, not through a clear provision, but through a 3 questionable implications from the preamble or other 4 provisions of the Act that don't directly apply, and it 5 did it without a peep in the legislative history that 6 Congress was trying to do this. I think it's remarkable 7 that for 30 years of Bayh-Dole, no one noticed this 8 supposedly all-encompassing vesting rule until this case 9 arose.

It only applies to 8 those things that the contractor freely or not freely 9 decides to get from his employee -- if he uses the right 10 words and so forth. 11 That also seems a little surprising, that 12 there could be such a hole in what used to be public 13 ownership of such matters.

FLEMING: No, no, I -- I appreciate the 17 question, Justice Breyer. 18 The point about the vesting statutes, it's 19 important to make a distinction between statutes that 20 expressly vested title, of which we know of three, and 21 statutes under which the government was entitled to ask 22 for an assignment from the employee or the contractor, 23 which were - 24 JUSTICE BREYER: Your answer is not as bad 25 as I think.

1 MR. FLEMING: Thank you. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- okay. Now. 3 (Laughter.) 4 JUSTICE BREYER: What about -- what about 5 the provision that says there shall be -- this is a 6 provision of the law, that the universities are supposed 7 to enter into contracts, funding contracts with the 8 government to make this thing effective. 9 Hmm -- effective. Effective for what? 10 Effective just to apply to some of the things that 11 universities got money to pay for? Or to a lot of them, 12 to all of them? 13 MR. FLEMING: Effective in terms of 14 inventions of the contractor to which the university has 15 the right to retain title. Try as Stanford may, 16 "retain" does not mean "get." It doesn't mean to take 17 away from somebody. An invention of the contractor for 18 exactly the reason you say, Justice Breyer, is not an 19 invention created by a contractor employee. Contractors 20 don't invent. 21 When Congress wanted to refer to employees 22 in the Act, it did; in section 202(c)(7), it refers to 23 contractor employees. In 202(e), it refers to employees 24 of Federal agencies. If -- if Congress had wanted to 25 pass a law that completely wiped out the practice of

1 leaving the relationship between contractor and inventor 2 to private contract, it had plenty of examples of how to 3 do so. It had the NASA statutes, it had the Copyright 4 Act, or it could have just written something clear that 5 said that. 6 It did none of those things because it 7 didn't need to. Over $200 billion of -- of funding 8 comes from the private sector to -- to technology and 9 inventions like this without the benefit of a vesting 10 rule. If there's any lack of clarity or lack of 11 certainty in this world, it is worked out through the 12 patent law, ordinary provisions, or through the common 13 law, and that is exactly the way Congress envisioned it 14 would be done in -- in the federally funded situation. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't there a - 16 MR. FLEMING: There's no need to state a 17 separate rule for Stanford for -- for inventions that 18 funded out of its endowment, versus inventions that are 19 funded out of a Federal grant. 20 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there a big difference 21 between the statute and the prior vesting statutes? The 22 prior vesting statutes said if the government pays for 23 the research, then the taxpayers ought to get the 24 benefit of the patent. But this statute says if the 25 taxpayers pay for the research, if the research is 100

1 percent funded by the taxpayers, taxpayers don't get the 2 first priority. The first priority goes to the 3 universities. 4 So it's totally different from the vesting 5 statute. This is a Federal subsidy for universities and 6 other nonprofits, isn't it? 7 MR. FLEMING: In some ways, Justice Alito, 8 that's right. And the point is that the statute is 9 limited to inventions where the contractor has gotten 10 title from its inventors. It is certain different - 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Federal Government 12 hadn't been doing much with the parents that it acquired 13 automatically? 14 MR. FLEMING: Absolutely not, Justice 15 Scalia. That's exactly - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the reason they gave 17 it to the university or to the private sector. 18 MR. FLEMING: That is exactly the reason 19 this act was -- was enacted, is to get rid of the 20 inconsistent practices among agencies as to the terms of 21 contracts with contractors. It has to do with the quid 22 pro quo. The Federal government gives the money, it 23 agrees not to demand title, and in return the contractor 24 takes on certain obligations. It isn't -- the 25 obligations are not opposable against a noncontractor,

And that's exactly 2 the same as the situations that we cite on page 35 of 3 our brief, which we've offered to lodge with the Court, 4 where Stanford co-owns patents with noncontractor 5 companies like the - 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What are the 7 obligations -- what are the obligations that the 8 contractor undertakes? 9 MR. FLEMING: The contractor agrees to give 10 the government a nonexclusive paid-up irrevocable 11 license. It agree to be subject to march-in rights if 12 the government feels that the invention is not being 13 sufficiently commercialized. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All things -- all 15 things that the government had and more under the prior 16 system? 17 MR. FLEMING: Yes. That's -- well, that's 18 certainly right. It will all depend on what the 19 individual Federal contract has, but yes, in many ways 20 the government was giving up rights in the Bayh-Dole 21 Act, and that was deliberate, because it was felt that 22 the -- that private entities would do a better job of 23 commercializing inventions than the Federal government 24 was doing, and that's not disputed, but it has nothing 25 to do with the rights that apply to a third party that

1 has not taken on obligations from the government, like 2 Cetus, that simply invited Mr. Holodniy in, in order to 3 collaborate, but before it did so, said: We need an 4 agreement to protect our intellectual property. 5 One of the hypotheticals that underlies 6 Mr. Ayer's presentation here is that Dr. Holodniy was 7 some kind of rogue, faithless employee who was out on a 8 frolic of his own and simply decided to assign away all 9 his inventions in satisfaction of a personal debt. But 10 the record is quite the contrary. He showed up because 11 he did not know how to do the PCR technique that is at 12 the core of this invention. The Court only needs to 13 read pages 55 to 57 of the Joint Appendix, where he has 14 marched through each of the steps of this invention 15 that's ultimately claimed in the patents and admits that 16 he had not done any one of them. 17 He went to Cetus, he took the -- he had the 18 benefit of a free flow of information from Cetus 19 scientists, and he also got confidential, proprietary 20 materials that were not available in stores, including, 21 particularly, the RNA standard, which is used every 22 single time one of these assays is run. It's the thing 23 that gives you the standard curve against which you can 24 measure the data from your unknown sample and figure out 25 what the quantity of HIV is in your patient's sample.

1 That was, you know, not available at Stanford. It was 2 designed by Alice Lang of Cetus. It was built by 3 Clayton Casipit in the Cetus lab. It was named after 4 him, using his initials, CC 2, and Mr. Casipit handed it 5 to Dr. Holodniy in a tube for free. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think that Cetus 7 would have let the doctor in absent the agreement 8 between Cetus and Stanford? Wasn't that the primary 9 reason they permitted the doctor in? It wasn't for this 10 ephemeral assignment of an unknown invention. It was 11 because the university and the company had entered into 12 a share agreement of what would happen if they 13 contributed to a Stanford invention. 14 MR. FLEMING: I wouldn't quite agree with 15 the end of the question, Justice Sotomayor. What 16 happened is that Dr. Holodniy's supervisor at Stanford, 17 Dr. Merigan, sat on Cetus's scientific advisory board. 18 When it became clear that Dr. Holodniy could not figure 19 out how to do a PC assay that would quantitate HIV at 20 Stanford, he arranged for Dr. Holodniy to visit Cetus in 21 order to learn how to do that. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they had a 23 preexisting cooperative arrangement, correct? 24 MR. FLEMING: It was a materials transfer 25 agreement, that's right. So when Dr. Holodniy went
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 there, he signed a separate assignment, the one that 2 assigned his inventions, as a result of the 3 collaboration or as a consequence of the collaboration, 4 to Cetus. And that was the consideration. 5 To this day, Stanford has not explained what 6 Cetus could have done to protect its intellectual 7 property so that it could have been able to practice its 8 invention without having to go to Stanford for a license 9 and pay a royalty. As far as I know, the only thing 10 under Stanford's theory that Cetus could have done is 11 told Dr. Holodniy to take a hike, because they couldn't 12 have any assurance that his employer would subsequently 13 say, You know what? There was a thousand dollars, ten 14 dollars, one dollar -- we don't know -- of Federal 15 funding under an agreement that has never been produced, 16 that is of indeterminate scope, and they suggest, simply 17 by averring in a patent application, that this is all of 18 a sudden a Bayh-Dole invention, even though it was - 19 indisputably now, under the findings of the District 20 Court, conceived before Dr. Holodniy left Cetus and 21 subject to this agreement, and it was done at a time 22 when Dr. Holodniy was being paid not by a 23 Bayh-Dole-related grant, but by a National Research 24 Service Award, which the Bayh-Dole expressly exempts 25 from its provisions in section 212.

1 So the notion that Cetus somehow has lost 2 the private right to the invention conceived using its 3 proprietary materials and information simply by the 4 subsequent use of an unknown amount of Federal funds, 5 that that works as a divestiture - 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You were here, 7 Mr. Fleming, when I asked Mr. Ayer about that - 8 MR. FLEMING: Yes. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not -- so that the 10 federally funded project existed at Stanford before 11 Dr. Holodniy ever went to Cetus? 12 MR. FLEMING: This, Justice Ginsburg, is a 13 question that was raised in front of the Federal 14 Circuit. The Federal Circuit didn't reach it. It is 15 open on any remand. Of course, we don't think there 16 should be a remand, but it's certainly not before this 17 Court. But to answer the question, here's the record on 18 this point. The salary was not paid by NIH grants. It 19 was paid by a National Research Service Award that is 20 exempted. The grants were never produced. The grant 21 titles, on their face, do not apply to the work that was 22 done at Stanford. One of them deals with establishing a 23 center for AIDS research. Of course, this is work that 24 was not done at the Stanford Center; it was done at 25 Cetus.

1 The second one deals with AIDS clinical 2 trials, and it's undisputed that there were no clinical 3 trials at Cetus. The clinical trials only happened when 4 Dr. Holodniy went back to Stanford. Dr. Merigan's 5 declaration, which Mr. Ayer referenced on JA98, says 6 only that Dr. Holodniy's research at the lab at Stanford 7 was covered by Bayh-Dole Act. It says nothing about the 8 work at Cetus. 9 And if there was any doubt, Stanford argued 10 repeatedly to the Federal Circuit that the federally 11 funded research started in 1990, and this issue was 12 decided on summary judgment against Roche when all 13 factual inferences should have taken in our favor. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 15 MR.

AYER: Thank you, Your Honor. 21 The -- I think the place to start here is 22 with the fact that Congress, faced with a history under 23 which the Federal government had taken ownership 24 outright of federally funded inventions in approximately 25 80 percent of the cases, enacted a statute to change

1 that because the government wasn't any good at getting 2 the stuff developed. And so they -- they defined the 3 coverage in terms of -- to cover these two phrases, 4 inventions of the contractor. 5 There is no question, if you look at section 6 200 on 1A of the blue brief, you will see in the middle 7 of this initial policy and objective section a reference 8 to what they thought they were talking about. At the 9 very bottom of that page, on the bottom line, they talk 10 about ensuring that inventions made by nonprofit 11 organizations and small business organizations. That's 12 the universe they wanted to cover. The same words - 13 "inventions made by those organizations" -- are in the 14 heading of the regulations, and they appear elsewhere 15 throughout the regulations. So they meant to cover the 16 universe of inventions that those institutions create. 17 We talked earlier about the word "retain." 18 The word "retain" cannot, consistent with its usage in 19 202(d), mean that whoever is retaining it must have 20 owned it before they started, because it's a hundred 21 percent clear, just from thinking about the statute and 22 from reading page 38 of the red brief, that when an 23 inventor is allowed to be considered for retention of 24 title, he never has ownership of it. And so the word 25 "retain" can't mean that.

1 What does the word "retain" mean? I would 2 submit the word "retain" means what it often means. It 3 means that sometimes in a situation, someone is allowed 4 to continue holding something subject to conditions that 5 may change, and perhaps in spite of realities that make 6 you think that's surprising. For example, a parent may 7 be allowed to retain custody after a disputed custody 8 hearing. That's a temporary thing, perhaps. The court 9 may allow it to change. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 11 The case is submitted. 12 MR. AYER: Thank you, Your Honor. 13 (Whereupon, at 12:08 p.m., the case in the 14 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
