 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 now in Number 02-5664, Charles Thomas Sell v. The United
 5 States.
 6 Mr. Short.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY A. SHORT
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 9 MR. SHORT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
 10 the Court:
 11 On Friday, this Court entered its order stating
 12 that counsel should be prepared to discuss the
 13 jurisdiction of this Court and of the court of appeals,
 14 and cited the Cohen v. Beneficial case, and they --
 15 QUESTION: 
 Mr. Short, did that subject 16 jurisdiction come up when you were in the court of
 17 appeals?
 18 MR. SHORT: It did not come up in the court of
 19 appeals, Justice O'Connor.
 20 In the first --
 21 QUESTION: It is interlocutory?
 22 MR. SHORT: It's a decision from -- it's a final
 23 decision under the collateral order doctrine.
 24 QUESTION: Well, that's the issue. Is it?
 25 MR. SHORT: That's the issue, I believe, yes.

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: No trial has taken place?
 2 MR. SHORT: No trial has taken place, not at
 3 all.
 4 I -- I believe that this Court, of course, has
 5 jurisdiction pursuant to section 1254 because it granted a
 6 writ of certiorari to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
 7 The court of appeals had jurisdiction pursuant to section
 8 1291, providing for appeal of final decisions of the
 9 district courts. I believe this was a final decision
 10 pursuant to the Cohen collateral final order doctrine.
 11 Now, while this Court has not addressed the
 12 collateral order doctrine under these set of facts, the
 13 courts of appeals that have, have unanimously concluded
 14 that an order approving the involuntary medication of a 
 15 pretrial detainee constitutes an appealable order under 16 Cohen, and these cases are set forth in footnote 5, page
 17 10 of the Government's brief.
 18 In order to fall within the collateral order
 19 doctrine, the order must satisfy several requirements. It
 20 must conclusively determine the dispute question, it must
 21 resolve an important issue completely and separate from
 22 the merits of the underlying action, and it must be
 23 effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final
 24 judgment.
 25 QUESTION: Well, that's the question. Would --

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 if it -- if we did not think there were jurisdiction, then
 2 at the end of the day, if the defendant were tried, I
 3 suppose that issue could be raised then.
 4 MR. SHORT: Except by that time, Justice
 5 O'Connor, his rights will have already been infringed. He
 6 will not be able to become unmedicated.
 7 QUESTION: Well, but that's not the point. The
 8 point is whether the third requirement has been met, that
 9 it is effectively nonreviewable unless it's reviewed this
 10 way. It seems to me it is reviewable.
 11 QUESTION: We held that in Riggins.
 12 MR. SHORT: Riggins -- Riggins was looking at a
 13 post conviction case, however, and looking only to see if
 14 his trial rights had been violated.
 15 QUESTION: 
 Perhaps it depends on whether we're 16 talking about the right to avoid medication, as opposed to
 17 the right to avoid medication for purposes of trial, and
 18 the latter would give you maybe somewhat more difficulty
 19 under prong 3, whereas the former, the right can only be
 20 vindicated by treating this as a final order. Would you
 21 accept that, or would you say that it's final even if what
 22 you're talking about is the right to avoid medication for
 23 purposes of standing trial?
 24 MR. SHORT: I would say on all three it would. 
 25 Certainly under -- under the First and the Fifth

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Amendments, whatever rights he would have would have been
 2 infringed irreparably once he's medicated.
 3 QUESTION: Well, are there -- are there no ways
 4 to challenge that, except in the context of the criminal
 5 prosecution? I mean, if -- if you had objections to being
 6 medicated, whether for purposes of, of making your client
 7 capable of standing trial or not, if you had objections to
 8 being medicated, why couldn't those objections be brought
 9 under section 1983 or in some civil action?
 10 MR. SHORT: My reflections on that, Justice
 11 Scalia, is, it would probably be too late. By the time we
 12 brought any type of other action, I believe the Government
 13 would have proceeded in the criminal case and gone ahead
 14 with the order and had him medicated.
 15 I also see filing such an action with another 16 district court, for example, having it defer to the court
 17 in which the criminal action was pending, I think there's
 18 some -- I think there's some procedural problems with, by
 19 the time that was done, Dr. Sell may have already been
 20 medicated, and of course -- we will address these issues
 21 hopefully in our briefs that are due, that are due Friday.
 22 QUESTION: What concerns me is, you know, the
 23 Cohen doctrine is over half a century old.
 24 MR. SHORT: Yes, sir.
 25 QUESTION: It has no rooting in the text. The

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 text of Congress' statute is quite absolute. We have made
 2 in that half a century only three exceptions under the,
 3 under the Cohen doctrine, and I'm truly concerned about,
 4 about the extent to which this new exception would, would
 5 be available to disrupt criminal trials considerably. For
 6 example, a defendant, instead of challenging the, the
 7 order initially can, can half-way through trial decide he
 8 does not want any medication, and then the trial has to be
 9 postponed so that, so that the order to continue the
 10 medication can be appealed. I just see real difficulties
 11 in running a criminal justice system when, when this kind
 12 of an order is immediately appealable, rather than
 13 reviewable at the end of the criminal case.
 14 MR. SHORT: Again, Justice Scalia, all I can say
 15 is, I think by the time that would be reviewed, filed, and 16 considered, I'm afraid Dr. Sell will have been medicated,
 17 and again we've already, of course --
 18 QUESTION: Well, that's perfectly true, but I
 19 think the hypothesis offered by Justice Scalia, at least
 20 as I understand it, is that even if that's the case,
 21 perhaps he has to wait till the end of the criminal trial
 22 in order to appeal it because our policy against piecemeal
 23 appeals in criminal cases has been so strict.
 24 MR. SHORT: I do -- I do understand that, but --
 25 and again, I think this is unreviewable.

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Do you -- do you equate it to bail,
 2 bail pending trial? If it's denied, and the trial goes
 3 on, you can't get it back again once the trial is over.
 4 Is -- is that your point, with respect to once -- once
 5 he's drugged he can't be --
 6 MR. SHORT: Once --
 7 QUESTION: -- restored?
 8 MR. SHORT: It's a simple statement, but once
 9 he's medicated he can't be unmedicated.
 10 QUESTION: I think you're confusing unreviewable
 11 with irreversible. To be sure, it can't be reversed, but
 12 can it be reviewed? In the case of bail, it can't be
 13 reviewed, because once the trial is over, it's a moot
 14 question. It cannot be reviewed. It's not just that it
 15 can't be reversed, it cannot be reviewed.
 16 But you're here asserting that this issue cannot
 17 be reviewed. It seems to me that's just patently false. 
 18 It can be reviewed. Your complaint is that it can't be
 19 reversed, but that has never been the, the Cohen
 20 criterion.
 21 MR. SHORT: My view, Justice Scalia, is it 
 22 can't be effectively reviewed. Once he's medicated with
 23 these drugs, whatever changes take place, these drugs are
 24 meant to cause changes to take place. That's the purpose
 25 of giving him these drugs. In effect, the decision will

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 have been made, his mind will have been altered, in
 2 whatever segment that is altered, and that cannot be
 3 undone.
 4 QUESTION: That is his -- if that is his
 5 objection, and if his objection is not that my criminal
 6 trial will be distorted, he should bring a separate civil
 7 action and perhaps the court would stay the criminal
 8 action until that one is, until that civil action is
 9 determined, but it's an entirely different procedure to
 10 come in in the criminal case and seek an interlocutory
 11 appeal from that order, and I just don't --
 12 QUESTION: May I ask a question about the
 13 back -- about the background order? Isn't it correct that
 14 in this case the Bureau of Prisons got an order
 15 authorizing them to medicate your, your client? 16 MR. SHORT: Justice Stevens, that is correct.
 17 QUESTION: And then you got a stay of that
 18 order?
 19 MR. SHORT: Yeah. There was appeal -- there was
 20 an appeal of that order, and then we filed a motion with
 21 the magistrate judge to have a hearing as to whether or
 22 not, as to the propriety of whether or not he should be
 23 medicated, yes. That's -- that's the
 24 procedural standpoint --
 25 QUESTION: But to pursue Justice Stevens'

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 question, that order was in the context of this criminal
 2 case.
 3 MR. SHORT: Yes, it was.
 4 QUESTION: Yes.
 5 QUESTION: The Bureau of Prisons order was in
 6 the context of this criminal case? I -- I thought that
 7 they ordered him to be medicated before -- before the
 8 trial was -- was on the horizon. Is that --
 9 MR. SHORT: He was -- he was sent to the
 10 Springfield Medical Center after being found incompetent
 11 under section 4241, in order to be treated to see if he
 12 could be restored to competency.
 13 QUESTION: You're going to brief this issue, so
 14 perhaps we ought to, since your time is running out, hear
 15 something on the merits of your --
 16 MR. SHORT: Very well.
 17 QUESTION: -- case.
 18 MR. SHORT: Very well.
 19 The individual, of course, we are talking about
 20 today is Charles Thomas Sell. He's a dentist. He is a
 21 pretrial detainee. He has not been convicted of any
 22 crime. In his present setting, he is neither dangerous to
 23 himself, nor is he dangerous to others. The Government
 24 wishes to medicate Dr. Sell.
 25 QUESTION: Is that a finding we have from the

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 lower courts, that he is not dangerous to himself or
 2 others?
 3 MR. SHORT: Yes, it is, Justice O'Connor. The
 4 district court made that finding, and -- and --
 5 essentially reversing the magistrate court, and the
 6 appellate court affirmed the district court's finding that
 7 he was not dangerous.
 8 The Government wants to forcibly administer to
 9 Dr. Sell antipsychotic drugs solely on the chance that it
 10 can, that it can bring him to trial on insurance fraud
 11 charges, nonviolent crimes. Dr. Sell does not want to be
 12 forcibly medicated. In his own words, he said, I do not
 13 want my chemistry altered. My brain is working fine.
 14 Now, Dr. Sell is legally incompetent. He
 15 suffers from a rare mental disorder called delusional 16 disorder, persecutory type. This is not schizophrenia. 
 17 The main feature of this disorder is nonbizarre delusions. 
 18 In other words, thoughts that are plausible, thoughts that
 19 can conceivably come true, probably won't. In Dr. Sell's
 20 case, he believes the FBI is out to discredit or harm him. 
 21 Excuse me.
 22 QUESTION: As I take it, that's try -- that is
 23 tied into the competence to stand trial because he thinks
 24 that's why he is being prosecuted, is that it, that the
 25 FBI is behind this?

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SHORT: Justice Souter, that's absolutely
 2 true.
 3 QUESTION: Yes.
 4 MR. SHORT: That's part of -- that's part of the
 5 delusion.
 6 But another feature of this disorder is that
 7 apart from the direct impact of the delusions,
 8 psychosocial functioning is not markedly, markedly
 9 impaired, nor is the behavior odd, which means that his
 10 disorder only affects him in a narrow, a very narrow band,
 11 but the rest -- most of his life he can perform as a
 12 normal person would, function in a normal manner, and as a
 13 matter of fact --
 14 QUESTION: Then he should be able to stand
 15 trial.
 16 MR. SHORT: The problem --
 17 QUESTION: If he's so normal.
 18 MR. SHORT: The problem, Justice Scalia, is,
 19 because of his delusion he can't focus on the trial --
 20 QUESTION: I see.
 21 MR. SHORT: -- on anything else other than the
 22 FBI.
 23 QUESTION: Well, what is your solution for this
 24 dilemma? We cannot try him for the crime that he's
 25 accused of, because his mind is not working properly. He

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 is entitled to refuse, you say, drugs that would cause his
 2 mind to work properly. It's a vicious -- what -- what do
 3 we do with him? Do we continue to hold him with the
 4 inability to stand trial, not treat him, because he
 5 refuses treatment? I -- it's just a crazy situation. 
 6 What can be done about it?
 7 MR. SHORT: Your Honor, our -- because we feel
 8 that he is a) medically competent -- no one has ever
 9 contended that Dr. Sell is not medically competent. Dr.
 10 Sell is perfectly able to make his own health care
 11 decisions, and make his own decisions about his mind and
 12 his body, and he has made the decision --
 13 QUESTION: But he's legally incompetent, you
 14 say --
 15 MR. SHORT: 
 He's legally incompetent -16 QUESTION: -- to stand trial.
 17 MR. SHORT: Yes, but he's not mentally
 18 incompetent.
 19 QUESTION: And is there a finding below that
 20 medication will -- there's a substantial probability he
 21 would be restored to competence if there were medication?
 22 MR. SHORT: The standard's changed somewhat, but
 23 the answer is essentially yes.
 24 QUESTION: And is there a finding that no less
 25 intrusive alternative is available to restore him to

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 competence?
 2 MR. SHORT: Yes, there was such a finding.
 3 QUESTION: And that the medication is medically
 4 appropriate?
 5 MR. SHORT: Yes, there was --
 6 QUESTION: Yes.
 7 MR. SHORT: There was --
 8 QUESTION: And even under those circumstances,
 9 you assert that there can be no medication?
 10 MR. SHORT: Yes. That is -- that is my
 11 position.
 12 QUESTION: And what is your general principle of
 13 law that justifies your position?
 14 MR. SHORT: First of all, since he is medically
 15 competent, he can make decisions about his own person and 16 body.
 17 QUESTION: I thought that you might have gone
 18 further in your case, and to say the Government just has
 19 no right to put needles into pretrial detainees?
 20 MR. SHORT: Well, on a -- at a basic level that
 21 is, that is what -- we have a -- we have a nondangerous --
 22 QUESTION: I mean, they can make the defendant
 23 wear a hat, put on clothes, give a voice exempt bar. This
 24 is somehow different. It seems to me at least that
 25 ought --

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SHORT: This is --
 2 QUESTION: You don't exactly argue that.
 3 MR. SHORT: This is very different, Your Honor. 
 4 We are dealing with a person who has been merely accused
 5 of a crime. He is medically competent. He is
 6 nondangerous.
 7 QUESTION: Well, you say he's nondangerous. He
 8 was later charged with attempted murder, wasn't he?
 9 MR. SHORT: He was charged with that offense,
 10 yes.
 11 QUESTION: He doesn't sound nondangerous.
 12 (Laughter.)
 13 QUESTION: So what are we supposed to do, just
 14 do this on the hypothetical basis that he isn't, although
 15 maybe he is?
 16 MR. SHORT: No, Justice Breyer, not at all. The
 17 nondangerousness --
 18 QUESTION: He didn't -- he did --
 19 MR. SHORT: The only -- the only times -- as I
 20 read the cases, pretrial detainees -- these are civilly
 21 committed people -- can be medically administered
 22 antipsychotic drugs is if they are in the prison setting
 23 and they are dangerous to themselves --
 24 QUESTION: So a person who's in a mental
 25 hospital, civilly committed, and he's dangerous, going to

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 commit suicide or possibly kill someone, that the doctors
 2 in that civil setting are forbidden to administer
 3 psychotic drugs? That's not my understanding. Is that --
 4 MR. SHORT: Maybe I -- maybe I --
 5 QUESTION: -- what you're saying?
 6 MR. SHORT: Maybe I misstated --
 7 QUESTION: All right, but -- so -- but my
 8 question on this case is the following. I take it you
 9 say, to follow the psychological association's standards,
 10 one, the court did consider whether any nondrug therapy
 11 could restore him to competence, and it answered the
 12 question, no.
 13 The court did consider whether there was a
 14 substantial likelihood of success in restoring the
 15 defendant to competence, and they answered, yes. 16 The court did consider whether the effectiveness
 17 of the drugs clearly outweighed the risk from side
 18 effects, and it said yes.
 19 It also considered the effects of the Fifth and
 20 Sixth Amendment rights to fair trial, and decided they
 21 weren't enough to change the question, so it seems to me
 22 that once you concede all that, they're following the
 23 right standards. 
 24 So is your claim that we should go and review
 25 because they, although they purported to follow the right

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 standards they didn't really do it, in other words, going
 2 to the facts of this case, or is your claim that those
 3 standards that your side's amicus says are the right ones,
 4 are not the right ones and, if so, what are?
 5 MR. SHORT: Our view is that, first of all we
 6 have fundamental rights at stake here, and the Government
 7 must show then, of course, a compelling interest in
 8 overriding those fundamental interests.
 9 QUESTION: But I would appreciate a direct
 10 answer to my question.
 11 MR. SHORT: I'm sorry. Maybe I misunderstood --
 12 QUESTION: It seems to me, either you have to
 13 say that the psychological association standards are
 14 wrong, or you have to say they're right, and if you say
 15 they're right, then you have to ask us to say they weren't 16 applied correctly here, but I want to know if you think
 17 they're the wrong ones, or if you think they're the right
 18 ones.
 19 MR. SHORT: I'm not sure I understand the
 20 requirements of --
 21 QUESTION: Well, if you read -- if you'd simply
 22 read the table of contents, as I'm certain you have --
 23 MR. SHORT: Oh, I have.
 24 QUESTION: -- of the APA, the psychological
 25 association's brief, filed on your side --

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SHORT: Yes.
 2 QUESTION: -- they have four standards, so I'm
 3 asking you if you think those are the right standards.
 4 MR. SHORT: I think essentially those are the
 5 right standards.
 6 QUESTION: Okay. If you think those are there
 7 right standards, do you think they were applied here?
 8 MR. SHORT: Yes.
 9 QUESTION: Yes, all right. Then is what you're
 10 asking us to do, since you think they were applied, and
 11 you don't like the answer the court came to, is what
 12 you're asking us to do today is take those standards, look
 13 to see how the court applied them, and come to the
 14 conclusion that they applied them incorrectly, or are you
 15 asking us to do something else?
 16 MR. SHORT: Essentially --
 17 QUESTION: I'm just trying to clarify --
 18 MR. SHORT: Essentially that's it.
 19 QUESTION: That's it. 
 20 QUESTION: And I -- I don't know why you concede
 21 that the Government has this right at all. What gives the
 22 Government the authority to medicate a pretrial detainee
 23 or someone pretrial -- supposing they're not even in, in
 24 custody. Can they essentially, out with a needle the day
 25 before the trial and say, we're going to get you ready for

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 trial?
 2 MR. SHORT: Well, it's very possible then, of
 3 course, I'm not understanding Justice Breyer's contention,
 4 and it's my fault. I don't concede that they can do this
 5 at all.
 6 QUESTION: Well then, you think these standards
 7 are wrong. The standards -- can you come up in your
 8 mind --
 9 MR. SHORT: I --
 10 QUESTION: I won't pursue this, but I'm just
 11 trying to clarify what it is you want us to do. Now, call
 12 into your own mind the standards of the American
 13 Psychological Association. I read that amicus with some
 14 care, I'm very interested, and it seemed to me similar in
 15 principle to the Government's point of view, and I want to 16 know, in -- though they may not think they're applied
 17 correctly here, but what -- what -- tell me about it.
 18 MR. SHORT: I'm sorry, I can't recall their
 19 standards with such preciseness that I can answer that
 20 question.
 21 QUESTION: Well, I thought, looking at your
 22 brief, that you were asserting that the petitioner has a
 23 right to be free from compelled medication by the
 24 Government, period, per se. That's the rule.
 25 MR. SHORT: That is my under -- that is my --

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Page 26 of your brief. So you
 2 don't -- you don't go along with any other standards. 
 3 You're saying there is an absolute right to be free from
 4 compelled medication.
 5 MR. SHORT: That is our position.
 6 QUESTION: How about -- how about -- how about
 7 vaccinating little children with a needle against
 8 smallpox? I guess there's no right to do that by the
 9 Government?
 10 MR. SHORT: Yes, there is a right to do that.
 11 QUESTION: Oh.
 12 MR. SHORT: The intrusion there is very minimal,
 13 and I think the Government -- the governmental interest is
 14 obviously to protect it against the spread of whatever
 15 dis --
 16 QUESTION: And I take it that's pursuant to the
 17 statute, not because some prosecutor thinks it's a good
 18 idea.
 19 MR. SHORT: That's --
 20 QUESTION: Then you don't even agree with the
 21 dissenting judge in the court below who said there could
 22 be forcible medication for a violent crime?
 23 MR. SHORT: I do not -- that's correct, Mr.
 24 Chief Justice. I do not --
 25 QUESTION: Well, the -- --

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Then I wish you'd go back to a
 2 question I asked earlier that I don't think I got an
 3 answer to. What do you propose that we do with this man? 
 4 He's been accused of a serious crime. For purposes of
 5 this case you're willing to assume it to be the same if he
 6 had been accused of a violent crime.
 7 MR. SHORT: That's correct.
 8 QUESTION: He is -- his mental ability is such
 9 that he cannot be tried. The means are available to
 10 straighten his mind out so that he is competent to stand
 11 trial, but you say no, if he refuses that, we must respect
 12 his wishes. Then what do we do with him? Do we let him
 13 go?
 14 MR. SHORT: The direct answer to your question,
 15 Justice Scalia, is --
 16 QUESTION: Is we let him go.
 17 MR. SHORT: -- is that you do not -- he will not
 18 be let go.
 19 QUESTION: Why not?
 20 QUESTION: What happens to him? You can't keep
 21 him in prison indefinitely. I had very much the same
 22 question in mind. As I understand it, and correct me if
 23 I'm wrong, he could not be civilly committed, since he's
 24 been found nondangerous.
 25 MR. SHORT: That's correct.

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: If he were found dangerous, he could
 2 be civilly committed. So here he is, nondangerous, but
 3 incompetent to stand trial. You -- you agree that civil
 4 commitment was -- isn't -- isn't available under those
 5 circumstances?
 6 MR. SHORT: No, I -- civil commitment is what's
 7 going to happen to this individual under 4241.
 8 QUESTION: How? How is he going to be committed
 9 if he's not dangerous?
 10 MR. SHORT: Because 4241 provides that a person
 11 who can't stand trial because they are legally incompetent
 12 are referred to the sections of 4246. The director at
 13 that facility, under section 4246, will then have to make
 14 a determination as to whether or not Dr. Sell is a
 15 substantial risk to persons or property of others if -16 QUESTION: And -- and you are telling us -- and
 17 you are telling us, are you not, that he is not a
 18 substantial risk? That -- that that may not be something
 19 we accept in view of the murder charge, but I mean, on
 20 your theory, you are saying he's not dangerous.
 21 MR. SHORT: Justice Souter, I'm saying there are
 22 two different standards at --
 23 QUESTION: No, I realize there are two different
 24 standards, but there's -- if I understand the
 25 representations you have been making to the Court about

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 your client, under the standard for commitment, if he
 2 cannot be tried, he would not be subject to commitment. 
 3 Am I wrong?
 4 MR. SHORT: Yes, Your Honor.
 5 QUESTION: He would -- so are you -- are you --
 6 MR. SHORT: He would. He would --
 7 QUESTION: He would be subject to commitment?
 8 MR. SHORT: He is subject to commitment under
 9 4246.
 10 QUESTION: He satisfies the criteria for
 11 commitment?
 12 MR. SHORT: Yes, he does. He does, and --
 13 QUESTION: And I thought that the whole reason
 14 why we're -- how you got to this stage is that a district
 15 court made a finding that this man is not a danger to 16 himself or others, and now you want to say for purposes of
 17 the -- your being here on that question, could he be
 18 medicated, because he's not a danger to himself or others,
 19 that finding holds, but once he avoids the trial, then he
 20 can say, ah, but for purposes of civil commitment I am
 21 dangerous to myself or others?
 22 MR. SHORT: No, that -- that's not what will
 23 happen to Dr. Sell. He will then go from the 4241 to
 24 4246, at which time the director of that facility will
 25 have to make a determination whether he is a substantial

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 risk to others, or property to others, if he is released. 
 2 He then has to make that certification. It goes to the
 3 district court. They have to prove that by clear and
 4 convincing evidence, and if they so show, he does remain
 5 committed.
 6 QUESTION: Yes, but you keep saying, if they
 7 show. Are you conceding that, in fact, the evidence is
 8 there to show it and that he will be in fact subject to --
 9 that he will, in fact, be lawfully committed?
 10 MR. SHORT: No, I am not -- I am not --
 11 QUESTION: Then I don't see how you've answered
 12 Justice Scalia's question.
 13 MR. SHORT: No, I will tell you, from my
 14 experience in this case, I suspect that's precisely what's
 15 going to happen, because of what the Government's view is 16 of this individual.
 17 QUESTION: No, but you --
 18 QUESTION: Well, I -- I hope that's what's going
 19 to happen, but I -- but I don't know how it -- how it
 20 comes about with the law as you've described it to us. 
 21 That's -- that's my problem.
 22 QUESTION: I have a different problem. Let me
 23 explain to you what -- I imagine that the slogan, mind-
 24 altering drugs, is not a very good slogan for present
 25 purposes, because there are a lot of seriously ill people

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 whom these drugs do help a lot.
 2 MR. SHORT: That's correct.
 3 QUESTION: Now, if we're thinking of that class
 4 of people, how are they any different from the class of
 5 people with very, very high blood pressure whose lives are
 6 at risk, and could be perhaps medicated with blood
 7 pressure medicine. These people could be medicated with
 8 antidelusional medicine. Now, is there a difference
 9 between those two circumstances?
 10 That doesn't answer the question, because what
 11 I'm looking for are the right standards to use to separate
 12 those genuinely ill people from others who may be more
 13 borderline, or may be less obviously helped.
 14 Now, you don't -- I realize now you don't have
 15 much time, but I'm -- that's what I'm struggling with in 16 this case.
 17 MR. SHORT: The standard, the standard, Your
 18 Honor, is whether or not -- and this is very basic,
 19 whether the person has the right to make the choice. Our
 20 position is that Dr. Sell has the right to make the choice
 21 over his medical decisions.
 22 He has had experience with antipsychotic drugs. 
 23 He took Haldol in the 1980's. He had an attack of acute
 24 dystonia, which this Court has recognized as being a
 25 serious side effect in at least three cases, Harper,

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Riggins, and Mills. He also has a psychiatrist that has
 2 told him that antipsychotic drugs will not work on
 3 delusional disorders, and Dr. Sell, with all due respect
 4 to what he's charged with, is not a stupid person. He
 5 does not want to undergo the effects of antipsychotic
 6 medication. He is making that a free choice, and with all
 7 due respect, I think he has a right to make that choice.
 8 QUESTION: Do you wish to reserve your remaining
 9 time, Mr. Short?
 10 MR. SHORT: Thank you, Your Honor, I do.
 11 QUESTION: Very well.
 12 Now, Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.
 13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
 14 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 15 MR. DREEBEN: 
 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 16 may it please the Court:
 17 I'd like to address the question of jurisdiction
 18 first. Dr. Sell's claim should be analyzed as having two
 19 related but distinct components. One component of his
 20 claim is a Harper-style objection to forcible medication
 21 by the Government in order to render him competent to
 22 stand trial. The second component of his claim is a
 23 Riggins-style objection to the fairness of his trial if,
 24 in fact, he is medicated and restored to competence and
 25 tried.

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 The Riggins-style claim is clearly not amenable
 2 to review under the collateral order doctrine. Dr. Sell
 3 has not even been tried. There is clearly no
 4 determination yet whether he can be given a fair trial,
 5 whether he will receive one, and he may raise an objection
 6 to the fairness of his trial at the conclusion of the
 7 criminal case and obtain reversal of his conviction at
 8 that time, but the Harper-style claim is amenable to
 9 review under the collateral order doctrine. It deals with
 10 a right that is effectively unreviewable if not reviewed
 11 now, just as this Court's cases addressing double jeopardy
 12 claims and qualified immunity claims are effectively
 13 unreviewable if not reviewed --
 14 QUESTION: Well, it's not just they're
 15 unreviewable, Mr. Dreeben, but it would -- I think we said 16 in those cases there the claim was a right not to be
 17 tried.
 18 MR. DREEBEN: Correct, and --
 19 QUESTION: Not to be tried at all.
 20 MR. DREEBEN: -- that right would be lost if the
 21 trial occurs. Here, one of his claims is a right not to
 22 be medicated. That right will be lost if, in fact, he is
 23 medicated.
 24 QUESTION: Well, what if -- what if -- what if
 25 someone says, I claim a right to be tried without this

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 evidence that I want suppressed but the court has ruled
 2 otherwise?
 3 MR. DREEBEN: Well, that's right and that's
 4 because the court has concluded that there is no right not
 5 to be tried in the relevant sense without particular
 6 evidence that will be suppressed. What that reflects is a
 7 right whose remedy would be a right not to have the
 8 evidence used against them, which could include reversal
 9 of a conviction, so that kind of a claim is reviewable at
 10 the end of the case.
 11 But taking Dr. Sell's claims at face value, he's
 12 saying it will violate my First Amendment rights and my
 13 substantive due process rights to be medicated, and those
 14 claims are, in a sense, independent of the main criminal
 15 action. 
 Justice Scalia is correct that in a sense they 16 could be viewed as claims that could be brought
 17 independently, but I think under the statutory scheme that
 18 exists they are better brought in the context of the
 19 criminal case, rather than through an independent APA
 20 action or some other form of action.
 21 QUESTION: Well, I -- I'd be less worried if, if
 22 all that was before us here is the up or down question
 23 whether you have an absolute right to refuse medication,
 24 and once that is disposed of, the issue goes away, but
 25 that's not what's before us here. That is not the only

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 thing before us here.
 2 The -- there is also the question, assuming that
 3 you can be medicated, what are the criteria, and I assume
 4 that any prisoner can make the claim, I have a right not
 5 to be medicated unless these criteria are fulfilled, so in
 6 every criminal case you're going to have a pre -- with
 7 someone who has psychological difficulties, or who is
 8 found to be not triable because of his mental state, you
 9 have to have this preliminary appeal all the way up before
 10 the trial can even start. It -- it's not a one-time
 11 thing.
 12 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, I'm a little bit
 13 less concerned about the practical consequences, although
 14 I share the view that the delay of the criminal case and,
 15 more importantly, concretely here, the delay in starting 16 the medication is a critical problem that results from
 17 collateral order review, but there are two things that I
 18 think reduce any of the costs associated with permitting
 19 collateral order review.
 20 First, if this Court does settle the fundamental
 21 question in favor of the Government and determines that,
 22 on an appropriate showing that this court defines,
 23 medication for the purpose of restoring competence is
 24 permissible, in the future, criminal defendants will not
 25 be able to assert that broad, unsettled, and important

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 legal issue and obtain a stay of the medication order in
 2 order to litigate it.
 3 What they would have to show is that the actual
 4 application of those standards to the particular facts of
 5 the case is incorrect. That will most likely be reviewed
 6 under a more deferential standard. Courts of appeals can
 7 establish expedited calendars to dispose of frivolous
 8 claims, and can weed out those claims that don't --
 9 QUESTION: But it would certainly be a new
 10 exception to the collateral order doctrine, would it not?
 11 MR. DREEBEN: It would be a new exception as
 12 applied to the particular facts of this case, but the
 13 standards of the collateral order doctrine I think are
 14 met, and there is --
 15 QUESTION: 
 Let me ask you, if we reach the 16 question of what standards to apply, it doesn't fit
 17 comfortably in any setting with which we're familiar,
 18 strict scrutiny, rational basis test. Do you see this as
 19 somewhere in between some kind of heightened review, and
 20 if so, what case do you think is closest?
 21 MR. DREEBEN: Justice O'Connor, I do think that
 22 a heightened form of review is appropriate. I don't have
 23 any case that has precisely articulated the correct
 24 standard of review, but in all of this Court's substantive
 25 due process cases, what the Court has done is balanced the

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 interests of the individual in his liberty, or in this
 2 case in the First Amendment concerns, against the
 3 Government's interest in achieving the objectives that it
 4 has.
 5 QUESTION: How -- how do you describe the
 6 authority of the Government to make this order at all? 
 7 Suppose this defendant were under a voluntary commitment
 8 in a private institution. Could you send your guy out
 9 there with a needle the day before the trial?
 10 MR. DREEBEN: In order to render the defendant
 11 competent to stand trial, Your Honor, the Government would
 12 have to have some sort of a finding that would justify --
 13 QUESTION: Well, you have -- you have this --
 14 this -- this case, let's assume it's this person, and only
 15 with the hypothetical alteration that I've given. It's
 16 this person, he's in a private facility, voluntary
 17 commitment --
 18 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think that that
 19 makes any difference at all, Justice Kennedy.
 20 QUESTION: All right, so what is the authority
 21 of the Government to go out and force him to be medicated
 22 so that he behaves the way the Government wants him to at
 23 trial?
 24 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the Government's authority
 25 here is the -- derives from the fact that Dr. Sell has

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 been indicted on serious criminal charges, and he has
 2 been -- been found incompetent to stand trial on those
 3 charges. The Government will be completely unable to
 4 achieve what this Court has recognized to be the
 5 compelling interest in adjudicating serious criminal
 6 charges.
 7 QUESTION: Could you inoculate a material
 8 witness? You have to have a prosecution witness. He's
 9 the key witness, but he's incompetent. Could you force
 10 him to be inoculated the day before the trial?
 11 MR. DREEBEN: It's the same due process question
 12 as presented here, Justice Kennedy, with the possible
 13 difference that our interests may be greater with respect
 14 to a person who has been charged than with respect to a
 15 person who has not. 
 Material witnesses are held all the 16 time without bail.
 17 QUESTION: I fully understand that, and I want
 18 to know if they can be medicated and what your authority
 19 is for doing it.
 20 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the authority would be an
 21 application of any principle that this Court adopts in
 22 this case to permit us to medicate the defendant. As I
 23 indicated, there is a distinction between a witness and a
 24 defendant, but here we deal with someone who has already
 25 been placed under indictment, which is to an -- a certain

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 extent a significant restriction on liberty as well as an
 2 indication of a paramount Government interest in
 3 adjudicating the charges.
 4 QUESTION: Well, at -- at the very least it
 5 seems to me that you should have statutory authority for
 6 doing this. Just the court thinks it's a good idea that
 7 the witnesses behave a certain way and order medication --
 8 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think maybe it's important
 9 to back up and look at how this case came to be before the
 10 Court. Dr. Sell was found to be incompetent to stand
 11 trial, and pursuant to statute section 4241(d) of title
 12 18, he was committed to the Bureau of Prisons for
 13 treatment to determine whether his competency could be
 14 restored.
 15 In the context of that confinement at a medical 16 facility, pursuant to regulations of the Bureau of
 17 Prisons, the Bureau of Prisons determined that
 18 antipsychotic medication and nothing else was the means by
 19 which the Government could restore him to competency.
 20 QUESTION: But that, that was competency for
 21 trial. That's -- that's -- that's the -- that's not the
 22 standard in the regulations, as I understand them.
 23 MR. DREEBEN: No, the regulations do indeed
 24 address the potential of medication for the purpose of
 25 rendering competence to stand trial. That's one of the

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 criteria that is given to the Bureau of Prisons when it
 2 accepts a patient for treatment under section 4241(d), and
 3 the bureau in fact made the finding that this was a
 4 medically appropriate treatment for a person who has the
 5 illness, the serious delusional disorder that Dr. Sell
 6 has, and that this treatment had a substantial probability
 7 of restoring him to competence. The --
 8 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, can you back up just for
 9 a minute, because there's a piece of this that I'm not
 10 clear on. I thought that before the issue of competence
 11 to stand trial came up, the Bureau of Prisons had
 12 determined this man to be dangerous to himself or others
 13 without medication, and that the Bureau of Prisons was
 14 going to medicate him under the danger standard.
 15 MR. DREEBEN: 
 The administrative order, and it's 16 the same administrative order that I referred to in
 17 answering Justice Kennedy's question, Justice Ginsburg,
 18 does rest on both restoration of competency and to a
 19 certain extent on concerns about danger.
 20 What happened after the Bureau of Prisons
 21 entered that order is not that it immediately implemented
 22 it and began to medicate Dr. Sell. Rather, it stayed the
 23 order, and Dr. Sell then sought judicial review in the
 24 very court that had ordered his commitment, which is why I
 25 think that it was appropriate for the district court to

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 hear this in the criminal action rather than under some
 2 separate APA action. This is the district court that had
 3 ordered Dr. Sell confined.
 4 The magistrate judge determined that the
 5 Government had not made a showing of dangerousness, which
 6 would have permitted medication under Washington v.
 7 Harper, but that it had adequately shown that medication
 8 was necessary in order to restore Dr. Sell to be competent
 9 for trial.
 10 Dr. Sell then appealed that determination to the
 11 district court, which entered its final decision saying
 12 that the Bureau of Prisons could medicate, there was a
 13 substantial probability of restoring competence, the
 14 antipsychotic medication was medically appropriate
 15 treatment for the psychotic illness that Dr. Sell had, and 16 that there was a reasonable likelihood of a fair trial,
 17 and any particularized fair trial concerns that Dr. Sell
 18 was raising, involving effects on his demeanor, or his
 19 effects to relate to counsel, should be determined after
 20 the medication has been administered and it's been
 21 determined whether, in fact, he was restored to
 22 competence.
 23 QUESTION: Can we get your answer to the
 24 question that Justice Scalia asked Mr. Short? That is,
 25 suppose it is determined that he can't be medicated for

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 the purpose of making him competent, what happens to him?
 2 MR. DREEBEN: Well, at that point, Mr. Short is
 3 correct that under 4241 he would then be referred over to
 4 the director of a medical facility where he would be held
 5 for confinement to determine, pursuant to section 4246,
 6 whether, if released, he would be dangerous to himself or
 7 others.
 8 QUESTION: Well, all right, suppose he's not. 
 9 Then he goes free.
 10 MR. DREEBEN: And --
 11 QUESTION: And the question I would like to know
 12 is, suppose that you have a person who has very high blood
 13 pressure, a defendant. Is it permissible, or clearly
 14 permissible under the law, to force him to take blood
 15 pressure medication so that he can go to trial? 16 MR. DREEBEN: It is not something that courts of
 17 appeals that I have seen have had to deal with, and this
 18 Court --
 19 QUESTION: All right, so we have exactly the
 20 same question.
 21 MR. DREEBEN: Correct.
 22 QUESTION: And so the question is not
 23 necessarily about psychiatry. It's about whether or not
 24 you can force a person to take medicine that makes him
 25 competent to stand trial.

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DREEBEN: I think it's a very particularized
 2 inquiry under the sub --
 3 QUESTION: I don't know why it would be -- it
 4 may or may not be --
 5 MR. DREEBEN: Well --
 6 QUESTION: -- different with psychiatry, but
 7 then the question comes back to, assuming we have the
 8 right standards, which are, I think you and the APA agree,
 9 the psychological people, I don't see much of a difference
 10 there between you, the lower courts, and the -- as to the
 11 standards if you can medicate a comp -- if you can
 12 medicate such a person at all, and so what we know is that
 13 you can go to the person with high blood pressure or the
 14 person who is seriously mentally ill, and you can medicate
 15 him, because the Government has a good reason, where he is 16 going to be tried for murder, assault, et cetera, all
 17 right.
 18 Here we have a property crime. Is this still a
 19 good reason? Suppose it were a traffic ticket? I mean, I
 20 take it this is a person whom, in the absence of a
 21 criminal proceeding, the Government could not compel to
 22 take medication. Am I right?
 23 Now, I've given you a number of things. I'm
 24 trying to elicit your views on things that are of concern
 25 to me.

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, the question of
 2 what would happen if Dr. Sell were living safely in free
 3 society is obviously distinct from this case. There's no
 4 authority --
 5 QUESTION: No, it's not obviously distinct,
 6 because I am assuming a person who is not a danger to
 7 himself or others is, in fact, in that position.
 8 QUESTION: And it's not distinct because you say
 9 the Government has an interest in having him medicated for
 10 trial. I don't see the difference in somebody who is at
 11 liberty and in custody.
 12 MR. DREEBEN: I had taken Justice Breyer's
 13 question to involve somebody who's at liberty but not
 14 charged with a criminal offense.
 15 QUESTION: 
 All right, now, if you want to make a 16 difference, fine, do it. I start out with the proposition
 17 that a person who is wandering around a free person now
 18 suddenly is charged. Now he says, I have very high blood
 19 pressure and I won't take my medicine, or he says, I'm
 20 delusional and I won't take my medicine.
 21 If -- can the Government compel person 1 or
 22 person 2 to do it?
 23 MR. DREEBEN: Yes to both.
 24 QUESTION: Yes. Where it's murder and assault,
 25 if they're about to -- a traffic ticket? No, all right. 

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 Now --
 2 MR. DREEBEN: I -- I --
 3 QUESTION: If that's -- if that's your --
 4 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer --
 5 QUESTION: Yes.
 6 MR. DREEBEN: -- the question that you're asking
 7 is, how serious need the offense be in order to justify an
 8 intrusion on substantive due process interests, whether
 9 they be through psychiatric medication or through blood
 10 pressure --
 11 QUESTION: Oh, that's exactly right, that is my
 12 question, because I thought that's what was at issue in
 13 this case.
 14 MR. DREEBEN: And I entirely agree that it needs
 15 to be a sufficiently serious offense to outweigh -16 QUESTION: What is -- what is the basis for the
 17 Government ordering medication in the case of high blood
 18 pressure, where -- where I would think it doesn't
 19 necessarily interfere with your ability to make trial
 20 decisions?
 21 MR. DREEBEN: Well, to the extent that a person
 22 was making a claim that, I'm not medically competent to go
 23 to trial because I have high blood pressure, and if I go
 24 to trial, I may have a heart attack and die. This
 25 actually happens. People will come into court and say,

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 you can't try me now because I'm too fragile, I have a
 2 serious health condition, and courts then have to balance. 
 3 It's essentially the same balancing test that's at issue
 4 in this case. They have to balance --
 5 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, can I ask you a question
 6 that I've been trying to -- thinking about for quite a
 7 while? Is the amount of time he's already been in
 8 custody, as compared to the potential sentence he might
 9 receive, relevant to the analysis?
 10 MR. DREEBEN: It may be, Justice Stevens,
 11 relevant to the analysis to the extent that courts have
 12 held that the amount of time that a person can be held for
 13 treatment under 4241(d) cannot exceed the ultimate
 14 sentence that they would receive.
 15 QUESTION: 
 And is that not true in this case? 16 MR. DREEBEN: No, it's not true in this case for
 17 a number of reasons. First of all, even limiting
 18 consideration to the medicaid fraud and money laundering
 19 charges, the test is the maximum sentence that the
 20 defendant could receive as a matter of statutory law, and
 21 he could receive a sentence --
 22 QUESTION: It's the maximum sentence, rather
 23 than what the sentencing guidelines would provide?
 24 MR. DREEBEN: Well, this Court obviously hasn't
 25 addressed the question, and it would be free to weigh

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 in --
 2 QUESTION: But if you assumed it was the
 3 sentencing guidelines rather than the maximum statutory
 4 sentence, is it not true that his period of confinement
 5 has already approached that, that time?
 6 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, it probably is. Of course,
 7 he's also charged with attempted murder and conspiracy to
 8 murder charges.
 9 QUESTION: Yes, but that was not -- that was not
 10 part of the analysis, as I understood it, in the court of
 11 appeals decision.
 12 MR. DREEBEN: Well, to be --
 13 QUESTION: It relied entirely on the financial
 14 crimes.
 15 MR. DREEBEN: 
 You're right, Justice Stevens, but 16 to the extent that the question is, how long can the
 17 Government hold him for treatment, he's clearly indicted
 18 for attempted murder and conspiracy to murder charges, and
 19 the length that the Government can hold --
 20 QUESTION: Well, is it critical to your position
 21 in this case that we take into account the indictment
 22 for -- for -- for attempted murder?
 23 MR. DREEBEN: No, because the Government's
 24 position here is that any felony case is serious enough --
 25 QUESTION: Even if the time he's already been in

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 custody exceeds the time he would get under the sentencing
 2 guidelines?
 3 MR. DREEBEN: Well, again, if-- if a court were
 4 to hold -- it's not critical to my position, because my
 5 position is, it's statutory maximum. If the Court were to
 6 hold that we're not going to look at the attempted murder
 7 and conspiracy murder charges, we are only going to look
 8 at the sentencing guidelines sentence, and we are going to
 9 hold that he cannot be held for treatment longer than his
 10 ultimate potential sentence, then the Court would have no
 11 choice but to remand for treatment of Dr. Sell under 4246
 12 to determine whether he should be civilly committed.
 13 Those are questions that were never litigated in
 14 any court, and are certainly not raised in the petition
 15 for certiorari. 
 What is raised in the petition for 16 certiorari is whether treatment to render a defendant
 17 competent to stand trial on a nonviolent offense is a
 18 sufficient Government interest.
 19 QUESTION: May I ask this other question, just
 20 to be sure I have your understanding on it? Has he or has
 21 he not been getting civil -- getting treatment during the
 22 period of his detention?
 23 MR. DREEBEN: He has not been getting
 24 antipsychotic medication. He gets --
 25 QUESTION: In other words, not getting

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 medicine -- I know he's not getting medical, medicine, but
 2 has he been getting any other kind of treatment for his
 3 ailment?
 4 MR. DREEBEN: Essentially, no, and the reason is
 5 that there is no other form of treatment, standing alone,
 6 that would have any likelihood of success with a person
 7 with delusional disorder, persecutory type. This is a
 8 serious thought disorder, interfering with Dr. Sell's
 9 ability to rationally understand what is going on in the
 10 world, and it's well-established in the medical literature
 11 that antipsychotic medication and nothing else is the only
 12 thing that may hold promise of treating the -- the ailment
 13 that he has. Now, the -- the --
 14 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, may I ask you to comment
 15 on this, on the question of medication? 
 One of the 16 arguments is that if you accept, for example, essentially
 17 your standard or the psychological association's standard,
 18 in applying it, you cannot apply it, as it were, in gross. 
 19 You've got to apply it with reference to the specific
 20 medication which is proposed, and that was not done in
 21 this case. I think the argument is, it's important
 22 because the effects of the various possible antipsychotic
 23 medications may vary tremendously.
 24 Would you comment on that argument, that even if
 25 we accept the standards, they -- they were not adequately

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 met here because the -- the order was not drug-specific?
 2 MR. DREEBEN: I -- Justice Souter, if a court
 3 were to attempt to make an order drug-specific for a
 4 patient it would be essentially ignoring the medical
 5 reality of what this treatment will entail.
 6 Now, Dr. Wolfson, the treating psychiatrist, or
 7 consulting psychiatrist at the hearing, testified that in
 8 his view there were two particular medications, quetiapine
 9 and olanzapine, which were likely to be the most suitable
 10 ones for Dr. Sell's case because of their very minimal
 11 side effect profile, that they would have a much better
 12 chance of not inducing sedation or other side effects that
 13 he might claim would interfere with the fairness of his
 14 trial.
 15 But he explained that he did not want to be 16 locked into a particular medication because one of his
 17 hopes, as the psychiatrist on the case, is that Dr. Sell
 18 would participate in choosing, if he had been told, he's
 19 ordered to take medication, which medication he wanted to
 20 take.
 21 This is the kind of interactive process that
 22 doctors and patients have all the time, and for a court to
 23 superimpose some rigid rule up front that establishes this
 24 and only this medication can be administered is --
 25 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, isn't there something

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 short of that, though? I mean, we -- we are told that
 2 there are the old kind of drugs that could be injected,
 3 and the new drugs, which originally had to be taken
 4 orally. Isn't -- that distinction between the category of
 5 drugs, not the particular drug within that category, or
 6 even a decision between something that's injectable and
 7 something that we'd have to force him to swallow, isn't --
 8 isn't that kind of determination something that the --
 9 shouldn't -- shouldn't there be some control over the
 10 Government's discretion?
 11 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I think the Court
 12 should be very cautious about superimposing a judicial
 13 decision making process on a --
 14 QUESTION: But just asking the Government to
 15 identify that general class of drugs, not the court making 16 the decision in the first instance.
 17 MR. DREEBEN: The -- the problem with that,
 18 Justice Ginsburg, is that the response that an individual
 19 patient has to a drug is individual-specific. Side
 20 effects can be described in general categories, but nobody
 21 knows what side effects will actually occur, or whether
 22 the drugs will be effective until they've been
 23 administered, and it is not uncommon for the treating
 24 psychiatrist to discover that a drug that may have a
 25 wildly, you know, significant side effect in one

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 individual has none in another, and a drug that's
 2 anticipated to be entirely successful turns out not to be
 3 successful.
 4 One of the newer, new generation of drugs, the
 5 atypical drugs that have the more favorable side effect
 6 profiles in general may not turn out to be suitable for a
 7 particular patient.
 8 QUESTION: But of course, one answer to that is,
 9 this is sufficiently serious so that you ought to have to
 10 come back. In other words, in -- in -- in -- the -- the
 11 premise of your argument is that there's kind of an
 12 either-or choice that is made here, medicate or don't
 13 medicate, but if the -- if the substan -- if a substantive
 14 due process right is recognized, one question here is, how
 15 serious is it, and maybe it ought to be regarded as so 16 serious that the Government would have to come back.
 17 MR. DREEBEN: That would -- might be true,
 18 Justice Souter, if the Government's alternatives were
 19 antipsychotic medication and psychosurgery, so that the
 20 difference was dramatic between the two forms of treatment
 21 that are being proposed, but even looking at the, at the
 22 classes of drugs that are at issue here, the atypical
 23 drugs and the older generation of typical antipsychotic
 24 drugs, there are very important and dramatic differences
 25 between them, but they belong to a family of medications

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 that are used for treatment all the time, and the
 2 psychiatrist's understanding of the various range of
 3 effects that might be achieved is not likely to be
 4 enhanced by subjecting that to judicial review, nor are
 5 the potential side effects so dramatically different that
 6 it calls for an entirely different substantive due process
 7 analysis.
 8 QUESTION: May I ask you a different question
 9 about seriousness, and I think it was raised originally by
 10 a question from Justice Kennedy, and I'm not -- I'm not
 11 sure of the facts or of your answer.
 12 Should we treat this, assuming we are going to
 13 recognize it, as sufficiently serious that the Government
 14 should have no power in the absence of legislation, and if
 15 that is so, is there any legislation that authorizes this? 16 MR. DREEBEN: There is legislation that
 17 authorizes and requires the Bureau of Prisons to treat an
 18 individual to attempt to restore him to competency once he
 19 has been determined incompetent. That's what section
 20 4241(d) says. Now, it does not --
 21 QUESTION: So it's treat for purposes of
 22 competency?
 23 MR. DREEBEN: Correct, and it does not
 24 specifically refer to antipsychotic medication, but in
 25 1984, when this legislation was enacted, it was well known

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 that, for the kind of psychotic conditions that render a
 2 defendant incompetent to stand trial, it's antipsychotic
 3 medication or --
 4 QUESTION: But you say the Government can do
 5 this even if the defendant is, is not in custody, and just
 6 to follow this same point, suppose a defendant not in
 7 custody, at home, is undergoing a hunger strike and he's
 8 going to die before the trial. Can the Government come
 9 out and force feed him?
 10 MR. DREEBEN: You know, Justice Kennedy, I'll
 11 answer that question yes, but I recognize that it involves
 12 a very different set of considerations, because the
 13 intrusion through force feeding of somebody who wants to
 14 die might be considered to be a very different decision
 15 than treating an ill person's illness with medication that 16 is the norm that's used to treat people with these kinds
 17 of disorders.
 18 QUESTION: But if -- but if your -- but if your
 19 interest is in making the defendant stand trial, it
 20 would -- it would seem to me that you could per -- suppose
 21 it was for -- I don't -- I -- we could play with the
 22 hypothetical, and your time has about run out. I still
 23 just don't understand your basic authority to do this at
 24 all.
 25 MR. DREEBEN: Well, as a matter of the

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 organization of Government, this Court has recognized that
 2 the ability to resolve criminal charges through the
 3 mechanism of a trial is a compelling interest in
 4 maintaining social order and peace, and in order to try
 5 these criminal charges, the Government has no option but
 6 to attempt to restore competency.
 7 QUESTION: What's the most intrusive thing that
 8 it's clear the Government can do to get the defendant
 9 inside the courthouse door?
 10 MR. DREEBEN: Well, it -- it's quite clear that
 11 the Government may seize the person and hold them in
 12 pretrial detention, which is a --
 13 QUESTION: All right, physically seizing him,
 14 shackling him, I guess. Anything else?
 15 MR. DREEBEN: 
 Not that this Court has 16 considered, but this -- this kind of medication has to be
 17 judged against the backdrop of the nature of the intrusion
 18 and the efficacy of the treatment for those people who
 19 have this kind of disorder. Virtually everyone who is
 20 committed to the Bureau of Prisons' care for incompetency
 21 determinations has some form of psychotic disorder that
 22 can be treated.
 23 There are, of course, organic problems that
 24 cannot be treatable at all, and there are other kinds of
 25 mental illness that can create this, but the statistics

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 that the Bureau of Prisons furnished to us in considering
 2 this case shows that 80 percent of the individuals who are
 3 committed take these drugs voluntarily.
 4 Of the remaining 20 percent who did not, there's
 5 very little indication that any sort of judicial relief
 6 has been sought through appellate review, and I think
 7 that's because these drugs enable someone who has serious
 8 psychotic orders to be restored to a point of rationality
 9 where they can make decisions about what they want to do
 10 with their life.
 11 So instead of remaining incompetent and perhaps
 12 being committed indefinitely to a Bureau of Prisons
 13 facility, where they may be warehoused without any
 14 treatment, or being released if they are not subject to
 15 civil commitment, so that they don't stand trial on 16 criminal charges and suffer essentially no consequences,
 17 most individuals accept the fact, particularly after an
 18 initial round of treatment has rendered them competent so
 19 that thy can understand the benefits of this, that the
 20 medication is the appropriate, medically sanctioned way to
 21 deal with the disease that they have.
 22 And when the Government has no mechanism to
 23 achieve its essential interest in adjudicating criminal
 24 charges but for using these medically appropriate means,
 25 and it can show the, the items that have been laid out in

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 our brief of medical appropriateness, no less-restrictive
 2 alternative, and that there's a reason to expect that a
 3 fair trial will not be precluded, the Government should
 4 appropriately have the authority to override the
 5 substantive due process interest that the defendant has
 6 asserted and medicate him.
 7 QUESTION: May I ask one last question before
 8 your light goes off? Under the statute that provides
 9 credit for prior custody, would this defendant's custody
 10 in the -- count?
 11 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, it would, Justice Stevens.
 12 QUESTION: It would, okay.
 13 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.
 14 Mr. Short, you have 4 minutes remaining.
 15 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY A. SHORT 16 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 17 MR. SHORT: I only have 2 minutes I need to use,
 18 Your Honor. I am going to essentially combine one of the
 19 comments made by Mr. Dreeben with questions posed by
 20 Justice Stevens.
 21 Mr. Dreeben says there is a -- we are talking,
 22 of course by a -- about an individual -- although I
 23 understand there's an overall concern about what the
 24 results of this case, case are, we are talking about
 25 Dr. Sell specifically, and the Government's interest --

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1 the Government states that they have a compelling interest
 2 in prosecuting Dr. Sell.
 3 Now, I do not believe the statutory maximum is
 4 what -- is what guides here on the thought of how long has
 5 Dr. Sell been in custody. Dr. Sell has been in custody,
 6 except for a 5-month period of time when he was out on
 7 bond, since May of 1997. Under any way you calculate the
 8 guidelines, and I submit the guidelines is the only way
 9 you can calculate it, he has served much more time than he
 10 would have served had he been convicted and sentenced on
 11 this crime, and under these circumstances, I do not see
 12 any compelling interest whatsoever on the part of the
 13 Government in prosecuting this defendant, Dr. Sell.
 14 Thank you.
 15 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: 
 Thank you, Mr. Short. 16 The case is submitted.
 17 (Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the
 18 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
