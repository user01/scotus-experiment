 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument now on
 4 number 01-6978, Gary Albert Ewing versus California.
 5 Mr. Denvir.
 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF QUIN DENVIR
 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 8 MR. DENVIR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
 9 the Court: In March 2000, Gary Ewing walked into a Los
 10 Angeles pro shop, took three golf clubs, stuck them down the
 11 pants legs, and walked out. He was quickly apprehended for
 12 that crime. For that crime --
 13 QUESTION: What was the value of the golf clubs?
 14 MR. DENVIR: Because the value of the golf clubs was
 15 approximately $1200, it was grand theft under California law. 16 For grand theft, as a general matter, California
 17 provides a maximum sentence of three years. It also --
 18 because Mr. Ewing had served a prior prison sentence, he would
 19 be subject to a recidivism enhancement of one year, so the
 20 maximum sentence that he would have faced under California
 21 law, but for the so-called "three-strikes law," would have
 22 been four years in prison, which could have been reduced by
 23 one-half by his conduct in prison and his work in prison. 
 24 However, because Mr. Ewing had a prior conviction for first-
 25 degree burglary, which has been classified as a serious felony

3

1 by California, and for robbery, which has been classified as a
 2 violent felony by California --
 3 QUESTION: Was it armed robbery?
 4 MR. DENVIR: He was armed with a knife at that time.
 5 And because of those two convictions, he came under
 6 the California "three strikes and you're out" law. And as a
 7 result of that, he received a sentence of life imprisonment
 8 and with a -- with an added bar that he could not even be
 9 considered for parole for 25 years.
 10 QUESTION: Would it be fair to add that another
 11 reason for the sentence was that the judge did not disregard
 12 the priors, and that was because the judge had the record in
 13 front of him and the record showed other --a history of other
 14 offenses? Would that be a fair statement?
 15 MR. DENVIR: It is correct, Your Honor. It -- the
 16 judge did have discretion to strike the priors or to reduce
 17 this wobbler offense to a misdemeanor. She declined to do so,
 18 partly on the basis of his prior record. His prior record
 19 were all misdemeanor convictions prior to that time. But --
 20 QUESTION: They were all misdemeanors?
 21 MR. DENVIR: Yes, Your Honor. All his -- he had --
 22 the prior convictions that he had were felonies were four
 23 felonies, all occurred within one year, in 19- -- in one
 24 month, in 1993. There were three first-degree burglary
 25 convictions, and then there was one robbery conviction. He

4

1 had other --
 2 QUESTION: Well, now, those surely are not
 3 misdemeanors.
 4 MR. DENVIR: No, Your Honor. I was -- I thought
 5 Justice Kennedy's question was directed not to the -- what
 6 they call the "strike priors," but to the fact that he did
 7 have other --
 8 QUESTION: Oh, other than --
 9 MR. DENVIR: -- previous crimes that were
 10 misdemeanors.
 11 QUESTION: -- other than the burglaries.
 12 MR. DENVIR: I think that's -- the sentencing judge
 13 relied on that, to some degree, in denying him any
 14 discretionary --
 15 QUESTION: Now --
 16 MR. DENVIR: -- relief.
 17 QUESTION: -- it actually went back to 1984, didn't
 18 it, with grand theft in '84, grand theft in '88?
 19 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor, the grand theft actually
 20 was a misdemeanor, as we've shown in the appendix to our reply
 21 brief. There was -- there was a misconception that that was a
 22 felony. And in fact, it was a misdemeanor in Ohio, the
 23 first --
 24 QUESTION: That was the Ohio offense.
 25 MR. DENVIR: I --

5

1 QUESTION: The --
 2 MR. DENVIR: I'm sorry.
 3 QUESTION: -- the one that was alleged to be a
 4 felony, I think, in the government's brief --
 5 MR. DENVIR: Is in --
 6 QUESTION: -- I think that it was only a
 7 misdemeanor.
 8 MR. DENVIR: In fact, we've attached the governing
 9 court records as an appendix to our reply brief that shows it
 10 was a misdemeanor.
 11 QUESTION: How many -- how many convictions in all,
 12 felonies plus misdemeanors?
 13 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor, I believe that he had the
 14 four -- the four prior convictions -- the strike convictions,
 15 the felonies, and I think he had another nine misdemeanors, 16 and then this present offense. I think that's the --
 17 QUESTION: And the purpose of the three-strikes law,
 18 as I understand it, is to take off of the streets that very
 19 small proportion of people who commit an enormously high
 20 proportion of crimes. I forget what the statistics are, but
 21 it's something like, you know, of those convicted, 20 percent
 22 commit 85 percent of the crimes. It sounds to me like your
 23 client is a very good candidate for that law.
 24 MR. DENVIR: We got -- we got --
 25 QUESTION: I mean, if that's a reasonable law. It

6

1 seems to me this is precisely the kind of person you want to
 2 get off the streets. He's obviously going to do it again.
 3 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor, we believe that the law, in
 4 itself, is not unreasonable and it could result in a
 5 proportionate sentence. It did not in this case.
 6 Under this Court's decision in Solem versus Helm,
 7 the Court has said that you can look to the prior record as
 8 relevant to the sentencing decision because it aggravates the
 9 present crime, but the focus must remain on the present crime.
 10 QUESTION: Well, Solem stands with Rummel and with
 11 Harmelin. They're really three different points, and Solem is
 12 probably the case that favors you most. But certainly Rummel
 13 is good law, and Harmelin is good law. And I think those
 14 cases don't favor you.
 15 MR. DENVIR: 
 Well, Your Honor, I believe that 16 Rummel -- the Court said in Solem -- the majority opinion said
 17 that Rummel would be controlling only in a similar factual
 18 situation. We do not believe we have that here. And as far
 19 as Harmelin was concerned, the basic principles of Solem were
 20 reaffirmed by seven justices in Harmelin and, we believe, when
 21 applied here, will show that this is a grossly
 22 disproportionate sentence.
 23 QUESTION: Mr. Denvir, would you clarify whether
 24 your challenge is strictly as applied? Because some of the --
 25 some of the points that you make seem to be going to the

7

1 statute wholesale. So, for example, you talk about it -- the
 2 statute's infirm, because it has no washout for aging
 3 offenses, but there was no such offense at stake here. The
 4 strikes were all rather recent.
 5 MR. DENVIR: That's correct, Your Honor. 
 6 And --
 7 QUESTION: So --
 8 MR. DENVIR: -- and to answer your question, we are
 9 challenging only the sentence that Mr. Ewing received for the
 10 crime that he committed, that he was sentenced at. There's
 11 much discussion on both sides of -- as -- I -- as the
 12 background of the three-strikes law. We have no doubt the
 13 three-strikes law could result in a -- in a constitutional
 14 sentence. It did not, in this case. So however the scheme is
 15 that reached this sentence, this life sentence for stealing 16 three golf clubs, that sentence is -- falls under the Eighth
 17 Amendment, in our view.
 18 QUESTION: But we -- so we should leave out things
 19 like no washout, that someone who never served any time would
 20 subject to the three strikes --
 21 MR. DENVIR: I think that's correct, Your Honor,
 22 that they don't play into this case. And I think that -- as I
 23 said, that the three-strikes law is merely -- it's the process
 24 that produced an unconstitutional sentence. It could have
 25 been produced by a different sentencing scheme, also.

8

1 QUESTION: Well, when we're examining the
 2 constitutionality of the three-strikes law, as applied to this
 3 sentence, we should take into account, should we not, the
 4 purposes of the California law, which was to have a law which
 5 was -- gave simple, clear notice of the three-strikes policy? 
 6 And if you want us to take case-by-case, then that whole
 7 policy is undercut, it seems to me.
 8 MR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor, I don't -- I don't
 9 think that's true. In Solem v. Helm, the Court made very
 10 clear that it was looking only to the sentence that was
 11 imposed on Mr. Helm.
 12 QUESTION: Yeah, I was going to ask you about that,
 13 because you had said that the principal focus has to be on
 14 this sentence. I'm just not sure what your authority for that
 15 is when we have a recidivist scheme of this kind. 16 MR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor, the -- in
 17 Solem versus Helm, the Court, of course, had a recidivist
 18 scheme. The focus there was on number of prior offenses, as
 19 opposed to the nature of the prior offenses. The Court said
 20 that the defendant, under double-jeopardy principles, cannot
 21 be punished for those prior crimes; however, they are relevant
 22 to the -- to the sentence imposed for the present crime. And
 23 the -- and the reason they are relative -- and the Court said
 24 this best in Gryger versus Burke -- is what they -- what
 25 they -- what they authorize is a, quote, "stiffened penalty

9

1 for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated
 2 offense because of repetitive one." That's at page 8 in our
 3 reply brief.
 4 But what Solem v. Helm made very clear is, although
 5 the prior crimes are relevant, the focus must remain, when
 6 judging proportionality or gross disproportionality, on what
 7 this -- what this defendant did at this time, what he is being
 8 sentenced for at this time.
 9 QUESTION: I'm just not sure how that works. What
 10 am I supposed to do with recidivism as a factor in analyzing
 11 this sentence?
 12 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor --
 13 QUESTION: Give it some weight, but not controlling
 14 weight, or something like that?
 15 MR. DENVIR: 
 -- I think that what the Court can say 16 is that his prior crimes are relevant, in the sense that they
 17 make this crime a more aggravated crime than a crime committed
 18 by a first offender --
 19 QUESTION: Well --
 20 MR. DENVIR: -- and that there can be a reasonable
 21 enhancement for that. But in this case, he has been sentenced
 22 to -- he has -- his sentence has gone from a maximum of three
 23 years for a first offender to life, all based on the
 24 recidivism.
 25 QUESTION: Well, why --

10

1 MR. DENVIR: At that point --
 2 QUESTION: -- why can't the State say that -- where
 3 a person has a string of convictions like this man has, that
 4 it's time to get him off the street, as Justice Scalia says,
 5 that he simply cannot conform to the law?
 6 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor, if he, in fact, committed a
 7 crime at this point that was a serious or a violent crime,
 8 they may have a basis, but what the Court has said very
 9 clearly is that --
 10 QUESTION: What --
 11 MR. DENVIR: -- is the focus remains on this,
 12 because otherwise --
 13 QUESTION: What --
 14 MR. DENVIR: -- he's being punished for the prior
 15 crimes. I'm sorry, Your Honor.
 16 QUESTION: Well, what's the reason for saying that
 17 though -- that you can only -- that the focus remains on this
 18 crime, but others are relevant? I mean, that really is kind
 19 of meaningless, it seems to me.
 20 MR. DENVIR: Well, I don't think so, Your Honor,
 21 because, as I say, what the Court has said over the years is
 22 that the important part about the prior crimes is that it
 23 shows that this is a repeat offense. And the fact that he has
 24 committed offenses in a row makes this particular offense
 25 worse. The fact that he has committed worse offenses in the

11

1 past does not aggravate this crime. I -- this is -- this
 2 still remains shoplifting three golf clubs, regardless if he
 3 had been a triple murderer or anything else, and that's what
 4 he's being punished for. Because if he's being punished
 5 because of those prior crimes, their nature, there's really
 6 serious double jeopardy --
 7 QUESTION: What do you think would be enough? 
 8 Thirty years? Would you like 30 years for walking off with
 9 three golf clubs?
 10 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor, I -- the -- if you -- if
 11 you look at our --
 12 QUESTION: I mean, if you're going to look on it as
 13 just stealing three golf clubs, and cast a blind eye to his
 14 long record of criminal activity, I don't know why you can
 15 give him any more than, you know, a couple of years. 16 MR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor, if you look to our --
 17 to the comparison with other jurisdictions -- and I just don't
 18 think this has been highlighted in our brief -- there are
 19 only -- there are only five jurisdictions that would have
 20 allowed a life sentence. There's only one additional
 21 jurisdiction, Montana, that would have allowed a term of years
 22 as great as the minimum sentence here, and that's -- Montana
 23 allows -- is five to a hundred years. And most states allow
 24 for either grand theft or recidivist grand theft --
 25 QUESTION: But we said --

12

1 MR. DENVIR: -- ten years at the most.
 2 QUESTION: -- we said in Rummel, there's always
 3 going to be some state that punishes more harshly than others. 
 4 And certainly it was not intimated that that state, therefore,
 5 would -- it was cruel and unusual.
 6 MR. DENVIR: No, that's correct, Your Honor. In
 7 Solem v. Helm, the Court noted that he could -- that Mr. Helm
 8 could have received a comparable sentence in one other state,
 9 and nevertheless held that it fell under the Eighth Amendment.
 10 QUESTION: Well, just help us one more time. The
 11 prior history is relevant, but then how relevant?
 12 MR. DENVIR: Well, Your --
 13 QUESTION: You say the principal focus has to be on
 14 the three golf clubs, like we're some judges out of Victor
 15 Hugo or something and that's all we have to focus on. But
 16 this -- there's a -- there's a long recidivism component here,
 17 and that's the whole purpose of the California law that you're
 18 asking us to ignore, it seems to me.
 19 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor, and -- what I'm saying
 20 is -- I'm going back to what the Court said in Solem v. Helm
 21 in its analysis, which I think is controlling here. It
 22 made -- it made the point that the -- the prior convictions --
 23 he cannot be punished for those, but they do aggravate this
 24 present crime that he's being punished for. And the way they
 25 aggravate it is that -- is that this shows that it's a

13

1 repetitive offense.
 2 Now, he can have a reasonable enhancement of the
 3 normal penalty for grand theft based on the repetition aspect
 4 of it, but at some point it becomes unreasonable. And it
 5 becomes unreasonable if you go from three years to life based
 6 on his prior crimes. At that --
 7 QUESTION: Why isn't it reasonable to say if he
 8 commits another felony -- he's committed, you know, three
 9 already and nine other convictions -- "One more felony,"
 10 California tells him, "and you go away for life." Why isn't
 11 that reasonable? And this -- and this was a felony.
 12 MR. DENVIR: Because of the nature of the crime that
 13 he committed, which is stealing three golf clubs, a crime that
 14 is not deemed either serious or violent under California law.
 15 QUESTION: 
 But is a felony under California law. 16 MR. DENVIR: It is a felony. It's actually a
 17 wobbler and could be charged either way.
 18 QUESTION: Why --
 19 MR. DENVIR: But in this case, it's a felony.
 20 QUESTION: Why can't California decide that enough
 21 is enough, that someone with a long string like this simply
 22 deserves to be put away?
 23 MR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor, if that were true,
 24 then there would be no limiting principle on recidivist laws
 25 under the Eighth Amendment. It would -- at that point, you

14

1 could say the mere fact that he broke any law -- if he broke a
 2 traffic offense -- a petty offense would show that he couldn't
 3 follow the law and could get a life sentence.
 4 QUESTION: Oh, I'd be with you there, if it was a
 5 misdemeanor or, you know, some -- but this is a felony under
 6 California law.
 7 MR. DENVIR: It is a felony, and it's one of the
 8 least grave felonies in California.
 9 QUESTION: But we have given -- we've said, at
 10 least, here, that we are going to give great latitude to state
 11 legislatures in determining how many years to give, and how to
 12 categorize an offense.
 13 Why don't -- why don't we look to the Harmelin case
 14 for the standards, rather than Solem? Harmelin came later.
 15 MR. DENVIR: 
 Well, Your Honor, I think you do, 16 because, as I understand the Harmelin case, if you take the
 17 dissent and the plurality, they both agreed on the basic
 18 principle here, which is that there cannot be gross
 19 disproportion between the offense and the sentence. And the
 20 reason I go back to Solem versus Helm is that it was a
 21 recidivist case and there was some further information.
 22 I don't -- as I read the Court's opinion, at least
 23 the plurality opinion, in Harmelin, the big change was that
 24 you would -- you would not look automatically to intra
 25 jurisdictional or inter-jurisdictional comparisons. You would

15

1 first have to find an inference of gross disproportionality
 2 before you'd go to the second -- the other two steps. That's
 3 what I understood to be the major -- the major refinement of
 4 Solem v. Helm that was in the plurality opinion.
 5 QUESTION: I'm slightly stuck on this, because I --
 6 I'd like -- there is some relevant information that I can't
 7 get a hold of, and you may have some in your experience, but
 8 it isn't in the brief.
 9 Imagine -- let's take the set of people who have
 10 committed at least two serious crimes or more, maybe 50
 11 serious crimes. They're very serious criminals. And they're
 12 warned, "If you do anything again, you've had it." So think
 13 of that set of people.
 14 Now, I would like to know, in light of that set of
 15 people, now one of the members of that set commits a crime 16 equal to stealing $1200 -- whether they steal $1200 or equal
 17 to that; that's a very subjective judgment -- what's the
 18 longest sentence such a person has ever actually served? 
 19 Here, they are going to 25 years, real years.
 20 And the second question I'd like to know is, What is
 21 the least bad crime that such a person ever committed who did
 22 serve 25 real years?
 23 MR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor --
 24 QUESTION: I'd like to know both of those things. 
 25 And, obviously, they're find-outable.

16

1 MR. DENVIR: I -- let me see if I can answer your
 2 question. As far as under the three-strikes law, there is --
 3 because it sets this absolute minimum of 25 years -- it's a
 4 life sentence, but it adds a kicker to it which says, unlike
 5 other life sentences, you have to wait at least 25 years
 6 before you can even be considered. So we -- since this law
 7 was passed in 1994, we have no experience with this law.
 8 QUESTION: Obviously, I don't want 
 9 experience --
 10 MR. DENVIR: Right.
 11 QUESTION: -- under this law. That would be
 12 circular.
 13 MR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor --
 14 QUESTION: What I'm looking for is, in the absence
 15 of this law --
 16 MR. DENVIR: Oh, I'm sorry. I understand --
 17 QUESTION: -- in the absence of this law, what is
 18 the longest sentence a person like yours -- and I'm defining
 19 "a person like yours" to be a really bad criminal who now will
 20 commit another crime equal to or the same as stealing $1200. 
 21 And there's loads of records -- I mean, in the California
 22 Adult Authority before this law was passed, et cetera.
 23 And the second question is, what is the least bad
 24 thing such a person who really served 25 years did?
 25 MR. DENVIR: Your --

17

1 QUESTION: That -- those are empirical questions,
 2 and you're talking about this being unusual. I don't know if
 3 it's unusual unless I know what happened to other people.
 4 MR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor, I don't -- I --
 5 there's nothing in the record that would answer that, but let
 6 me see if I can answer it in a different way. But for the
 7 three-strike law, Mr. Ewing, with his record, could receive no
 8 more than four years. Now, there are other recidivist laws in
 9 California besides the three-strike law.
 10 QUESTION: Under the California Adult Authority,
 11 which was only the law in California for 70 years, people
 12 could receive very, very, very long sentences.
 13 MR. DENVIR: They could, Your Honor, and California
 14 is --
 15 QUESTION: 
 And -- not this long for this thing, 16 but -- but -- but --
 17 MR. DENVIR: I think that's right. I think the long
 18 sentence -- the -- California substituted determinate
 19 sentencing law for indeterminate in 1977, and -- but under the
 20 old indeterminate sentencing law, my clear recollection is
 21 that those long, indeterminate sentences were always triggered
 22 by serious or violent felonies, and that is something that --
 23 QUESTION: No, they -- I've looked it up,
 24 actually --
 25 MR. DENVIR: No?

18

1 QUESTION: -- and you're quite right that this is
 2 not as -- you couldn't get this long a sentence, but you could
 3 get a pretty long one for being a third offender and
 4 committing a property crime.
 5 MR. DENVIR: And --
 6 QUESTION: But I -- that doesn't tell us how long
 7 the people actually served.
 8 MR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor, if you look for the
 9 question of parole in California, which the -- which the State
 10 suggests is -- saves his life sentence, the Court looked at
 11 this in 1995 in the case California Department of Corrections
 12 versus Moralez. And what the Court said at that time was that
 13 90 percent of all defendants who came up for their first
 14 parole hearing were found unsuitable for parole and that
 15 85 percent were found unsuitable at subsequent hearings. Now,
 16 that has not improved any, because, as you'll see in the
 17 amicus brief of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, at page
 18 18, as of 2000, the Board of Prison Terms, which is the --
 19 which is the parole authority -- their official records show
 20 that they only recommended parole in 1 percent of the 2000
 21 cases that came before them with a life sentence.
 22 QUESTION: Mr. Denvir, can't the people of -- this
 23 thing, by the way, was not adopted by the legislature, was it? 
 24 It was adopted by plebiscite, of the people of California --
 25 MR. DENVIR: By both, Your Honor.

19

1 QUESTION: By both.
 2 MR. DENVIR: Both by legislature and by --
 3 QUESTION: By plebiscite. So the people of
 4 California decided, "We want to be tougher." Why do we have
 5 to be bound by whatever the more permissive scheme was
 6 earlier? The people of California knew that scheme, and they
 7 decided, "This is no good. We still have too much crime. 
 8 We're not punishing people enough, or we're not keeping
 9 them -- keeping them incarcerated long enough." Why do we
 10 have to be bound by whatever the previous record was?
 11 MR. DENVIR: Well --
 12 QUESTION: It seems to me the question before us is,
 13 is it unreasonable to put away somebody who has this record?
 14 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor, first of all, as to the
 15 question of initiative versus legislation, it is my 16 understanding that the Court, in other areas, has said that
 17 there's no greater deference given to one than the other.
 18 But the other question is, there's no doubt that
 19 some deference has to be paid by this Court to legislative
 20 judgments or initiative judgments in the questions of
 21 punishment and in dealing with recidivists. The Court has
 22 made that very clear. But it is that deference that has led
 23 to the Court setting a very forgiving standard. The Court
 24 said that it would not require, in this area, or as excessive
 25 fines, strict proportionality between the crime being punished

20

1 and the sentence. It has said it was only when there was a
 2 gross disproportion, and that's a very deferential standard. 
 3 That is a standard that allows the legislature to make many
 4 reasonable judgments, but says that --
 5 QUESTION: So how do you decide --
 6 MR. DENVIR: -- some judgments are unreasonable.
 7 QUESTION: -- how much is too much?
 8 MR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor --
 9 QUESTION: What's the --
 10 MR. DENVIR: -- life imprisonment for -- for the
 11 crime of stealing three golf clubs, we believe, is cruel and
 12 unusual punishment.
 13 QUESTION: It's not life imprisonment.
 14 QUESTION: But we're just doing --
 15 QUESTION: It's 25 years.
 16 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor --
 17 QUESTION: It's 25 years that he'll really serve. 
 18 We know that. As far as -- what happens after those 25 years
 19 is a matter of parole or a decision by other people.
 20 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor, the sentence that he's been
 21 given is life in prison. He's been consigned to die in prison
 22 unless some administrative agency determines to let him out. 
 23 And as I've just quoted you --
 24 QUESTION: But I mean, parole, in all the cases
 25 you're citing, is relevant, so you can describe it as you

21

1 want. We both know what the facts are. The facts are he has
 2 to be in jail for at least 25 years, and then he might be
 3 paroled.
 4 MR. DENVIR: And he might be, but on -- there is
 5 no -- there is nothing in this record that would suggest he
 6 has a reasonable expectation in that regard. In fact -- in
 7 fact, what's before the Court would suggest that there is not
 8 a reasonable expectation, particularly if the animus that
 9 drives -- that drove the passage of this law continues for 25
 10 years and they still think, "Well, gee, if they committed
 11 these prior crimes, they ought to be locked up for life,
 12 because they may commit other crimes."
 13 QUESTION: In the statistics that you were quoting,
 14 though, those were not three-strikes cases.
 15 MR. DENVIR: 
 Those are not three-strikes cases. 16 QUESTION: Those are cases where people might have
 17 gotten reduced time for good behavior --
 18 MR. DENVIR: That's correct.
 19 QUESTION: -- none of which is -- and one question I
 20 wanted to ask you, in view of the infirmities of Mr. Ewing --
 21 is he still alive?
 22 MR. DENVIR: He is alive, Your Honor. He is --
 23 QUESTION: Counselor --
 24 MR. DENVIR: -- he's lost -- he's aged and has lost
 25 eyesight in one eye as a result, but he's still alive at this

22

1 point --
 2 QUESTION: How old was he at the time of sentence?
 3 MR. DENVIR: He was 38 years old. He's 40 years old
 4 now. So --
 5 QUESTION: Counselor --
 6 MR. DENVIR: -- as a practical matter -- I mean,
 7 this -- 25 years is probably a life sentence for him, unless
 8 there's some major medical development that --
 9 QUESTION: Mr. Denvir, you conceded a moment ago
 10 that the prior offenses can be considered for purposes of
 11 treating this offense as an aggravated offense, given the
 12 prior record; and yet when you answer -- you've done this more
 13 than once -- when you have answered the question of going to
 14 disproportionality, you have said, "It's 25 to life for
 15 stealing three golf clubs."
 16 I don't think you can have it both ways. Either
 17 your argument is it's 25 -- the appropriate comparison is --
 18 or the appropriate characterization is "25 to life for three
 19 golf clubs," in which case you, in effect, are telling us,
 20 "Ignore the priors; they don't aggravate," or you've got to
 21 say, "It's 25 to life for stealing three golf clubs when you
 22 have a prior record" -- whatever it was, nine prior offenses,
 23 including four felonies, in this case. Which is it? Because
 24 I assume it may well affect the result.
 25 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor, I -- if -- I misspoke. 

23

1 What we say is the focus must be on the present offense. It
 2 is an aggravated offense. He is a repeat --
 3 QUESTION: But when you said that --
 4 MR. DENVIR: -- a repeat offender. He is a repeat
 5 offender. He is someone who committed this offense with a
 6 prior record of nine offenses?"
 7 QUESTION: Is it inconsistent with your position --
 8 when you say, "The focus must be on this offense," is it
 9 inconsistent with that to say, "This offense -- is stealing
 10 three golf clubs worth $1200 by somebody with a prior record
 11 of nine offenses"? Is that consistent with putting the focus
 12 on this offense, in the terms that you're using?
 13 MR. DENVIR: I think it is, in the sense that it
 14 shows that there has -- there has been some -- there has been
 15 a series of repetition. 
 But what I'm suggesting to the Court 16 is that regardless of the repetition, the fact that it's a
 17 repetitive offense, if the focus remains on what he did now,
 18 the triggering offense, which, under Solem v. Helm, is the
 19 focus, then no matter what he has done in the past, no matter
 20 how much repetition, it is --it is grossly disproportional to
 21 sentence him to a life sentence. At that point --
 22 QUESTION: A hundred prior instances of stealing
 23 three golf clubs would not affect the analysis then on your
 24 view?
 25 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor, if there -- if there were

24

1 a -- if there were a series of crimes of the same nature --
 2 for instance, if there --
 3 QUESTION: Well, I've just -- I've just given you
 4 one.
 5 MR. DENVIR: Yes.
 6 QUESTION: A hundred prior -- three golf clubs every
 7 time, a hundred times -- would that justify the treatment that
 8 he has gotten?
 9 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor, I think that that would --
 10 that would show a propensity to steal golf clubs, but, again,
 11 I don't believe --
 12 QUESTION: I would concede that, but the --
 13 (Laughter.) 
 14 MR. DENVIR: -- I don't believe --
 15 QUESTION: 
 Posit further that his score has not 16 improved.
 17 (Laughter.) 
 18 MR. DENVIR: He shouldn't be penalized for that. 
 19 That may be beyond his control.
 20 QUESTION: Okay, but if we -- if we've got our crazy
 21 example of a hundred priors exactly like this, and we follow
 22 your verbal criterion at least of focusing on this offense as
 23 aggravated, would this be disproportionate, grossly?
 24 MR. DENVIR: I believe that life is, because it is
 25 still -- the crime that has to be punished -- I mean, and this

25

1 is what the Court said in Solem v. Helm -- this is --
 2 QUESTION: Well, maybe we were trying --
 3 MR. DENVIR: -- you know, in Solem v. Helm --
 4 QUESTION: -- maybe we were trying to have it both
 5 ways verbally because we were imprecise. But with respect, I
 6 think that's what you're trying to do. Because on the one
 7 hand, you concede, yes, it may be regarded as an aggravated
 8 offense in light of the priors, and then in the next breath
 9 you say, "But the focus has got to be on this offense."
 10 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor, I -- Your Honor, there's no
 11 doubt that the prior record -- and the Court has said that is
 12 relevant to the punishment for the present crime, and it does
 13 aggravate it. But there are limits to how aggravated
 14 shoplifting three golf clubs can be, no matter what has
 15 happened before --
 16 QUESTION: Even with the hundred prior instances?
 17 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor, it's still three -- it's
 18 still stealing three golf clubs. It's not robbery, rape,
 19 murder, or something of that nature. I mean, it is -- it is
 20 still there. I mean, the -- to raise your question, what if
 21 someone had a long history of jay-walking and had seven or ten
 22 or a hundred convictions for jay-walking and jay-walked again? 
 23 I think the Court would not say you could get a life sentence
 24 for that just --
 25 QUESTION: I don't --

26

1 MR. DENVIR: -- because it's repetitive.
 2 QUESTION: -- I don't think it would. And the
 3 reason it wouldn't is -- I assume you would concede -- is that
 4 jay-walking does not hurt other people the way 100 instances
 5 of stealing golf clubs worth $1200 hurts other people.
 6 MR. DENVIR: It hurts in the sense that it's a
 7 property crime and causes --
 8 QUESTION: Well, you know, and --
 9 MR. DENVIR: -- a loss, that's correct.
 10 QUESTION: -- and may lead to something beyond
 11 property crime. Isn't grand larceny much more likely to
 12 result in physical confrontation and --
 13 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor, I --
 14 QUESTION: -- physical injury than jay-walking?
 15 MR. DENVIR: 
 -- Your -- it is -- it is, Your Honor, 16 and I think --
 17 QUESTION: Which is why it's a felony.
 18 MR. DENVIR: -- and I think that if there had been
 19 some -- some violence that had actually occurred out of this,
 20 then he undoubtedly would have been punished under a different
 21 statute with higher --
 22 QUESTION: It's a serious crime, in part because of
 23 that -- in part because of the risk of physical confrontation
 24 that it poses.
 25 MR. DENVIR: But Your Honor, California determined

27

1 that when it set the ranges for grand theft --
 2 QUESTION: Would you like -- would you like to reserve time,
 3 Mr. Denvir?
 4 MR. DENVIR: If the Court has further questions, I'd
 5 rather answer the questions --
 6 QUESTION: Very well --
 7 MR. DENVIR: -- than reserve time.
 8 QUESTION: Very well. You asked for it, you --
 9 MR. DENVIR: California considered that when they
 10 set the penalties for grand theft. And they set the penalty
 11 as a maximum of three years in prison. If they set different
 12 penalties for grand theft from a person, and for robbery,
 13 there is -- there is -- all those things are taken into
 14 consideration here. And the fact that this could have
 15 eventuated into something else, the fact of the matter is that 16 it did not. And in fact, if anything, Mr. Ewing seemed to be
 17 doing everything he can to be -- to get out of there
 18 undetected, if that -- if you look at the facts of this crime.
 19 QUESTION: I'm curious about one thing. Was he
 20 really a very tall man, or were these irons rather than wood?
 21 (Laughter.) 
 22 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor, to tell you the truth, I
 23 have no idea how he could have done that. It seems to me a
 24 miracle that he could have -- actually got out the door, but
 25 he apparently did. He's not a very tall man, as I recall.

28

1 QUESTION: It is a good thing that walking is not an
 2 essential part of golf, because otherwise walking with
 3 those --
 4 MR. DENVIR: I think --
 5 QUESTION: -- golf clubs in his pants would have
 6 been very difficult.
 7 (Laughter.) 
 8 MR. DENVIR: I think he was planning on removing
 9 them before he used them, I take it --
 10 QUESTION: He took a golf cart out to the car.
 11 (Laughter.) 
 12 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor, I would reserve any
 13 additional time, unless there's additional questions.
 14 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Denvir.
 15 MR. DENVIR: Thank you.
 16 QUESTION: Mr. De Nicola, we'll hear from you.
 17 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD E. DE NICOLA
 18 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 19 MR. DE NICOLA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
 20 the Court: First, I think, in answer to Justice Breyer's
 21 question, I don't know what the statistics are under the old
 22 indeterminate sentencing law that was in effect in California
 23 until 1976. But in a way, I think the -- Your Honor's
 24 question triggers an issue that I think is central here.
 25 The ISL, the old California law, was premised very

29

1 explicitly on a penological theory that emphasized
 2 rehabilitation of the offender. I think the question that's
 3 raised in this case, and it's a question that's particularly
 4 apt in light of the Harmelin opinion, is, when can a state
 5 decide that they're going to move away from a more lenient
 6 policy of rehabilitation or extending leniency to a first-
 7 time offender, and move toward a policy, a tougher policy, of
 8 incapacitation?
 9 QUESTION: So, tell me, am I fair to assume there
 10 never, in the history of the United States, has been a person
 11 who -- of the set -- I'm only -- I don't want to be
 12 pejorative; I want to characterize it your way, and I'll
 13 characterize it as taking the set of very serious criminals
 14 with very serious records, and a person in that set commits
 15 another crime, and the other crime is approximately theft of 16 $1200 -- and am I fair in saying there hasn't been, ever, a
 17 sentence in the history of the United States in the last
 18 hundred years anywhere close to this one? And I base that on
 19 my knowledge -- which you could get; it's public -- of 35,000
 20 real cases in the federal system where to get a sentence like
 21 this one for a prior offender, you had to -- you have to now,
 22 you know, hijack an airplane, commit murder, something really
 23 serious beyond belief compared to this, and that the worst
 24 sentence you could get for something like this is about four,
 25 five years.

30

1 And then I look to the California Adult Authority,
 2 and I see, under that sentencing, nobody could have gotten
 3 more than ten real years, and, indeed, the average was
 4 somewhere around five. And you have all those records, and
 5 you have come up with nothing in your brief. And therefore,
 6 can I say -- my assumption is, this is by an order or factor
 7 of two or three times higher than anyone ever was sentenced
 8 before in the United States for such a thing?
 9 You see, I'm making a very extreme statement
 10 empirically, and I want to know what the response is to my
 11 statement, and I want to know why I shouldn't hold you to my
 12 statement since you have the information, and why I shouldn't
 13 say that's just way too much.
 14 MR. DE NICOLA: Well, again, Your Honor, I -- the --
 15 my answer is that I do not know what those records would have 16 shown.
 17 QUESTION: I guess he shouldn't hold you to it,
 18 since you don't have the burden of persuasion here, do you? I
 19 thought you're defending a -- a decision below.
 20 MR. DE NICOLA: Yes, and I did interpret the issue
 21 to be a proportionality issue rather than an unusualness
 22 issue. But I do -- something in the recesses of my mind tells
 23 me that we had a three-time loser statute in California, and I
 24 think that put people away for life without parole.
 25 QUESTION: Well, all right, how do we decide --how

31

1 do we decide if you say, of this serious set of criminals, you
 2 go to jail for life if you jay-walk -- I mean, the next time. 
 3 Is that -- is that disproportionate? How am I supposed to say
 4 what is or was -- is not if I don't look to the empirical
 5 facts? And I'm not holding you to present empirical facts. 
 6 I'm just saying, Why shouldn't I decide on the basis of
 7 empirical fact that is available?
 8 MR. DE NICOLA: Well, in our view, the most
 9 prominent, kind of, objective factor that this Court could
 10 look to in weighing this sentence is what the legislature has
 11 said are felonies. What California has done in this case is,
 12 they've narrowed their target to a subclass of felons who have
 13 committed what the legislature has deemed to be -- and I think
 14 what, on the face of it, can reasonably be interpreted as
 15 being -- serious or violent crimes.
 16 QUESTION: What's the limit for being -- what is the
 17 dividing line between grand theft and petty theft in
 18 California?
 19 MR. DE NICOLA: Four hundred dollars, Your Honor.
 20 QUESTION: When I went to law school, it was $100,
 21 except if it was citrus you stole, it was $50.
 22 (Laughter.) 
 23 MR. DE NICOLA: Now it's $100 if it's citrus.
 24 (Laughter.) 
 25 MR. DE NICOLA: But once there is that predicate of

32

1 serious or violent felonies set in place, then what the three-
 2 strikes law does is, I think, reasonably moves toward a policy
 3 of incapacitation upon the commission of, not just any new
 4 crime, not a misdemeanor or an infraction, but a new crime
 5 that the legislature has --
 6 QUESTION: One of the things that puzzles me about
 7 the statute -- maybe you can enlighten me -- I thought that if
 8 there were two priors that were violent but not related to
 9 property, such as murder and rape, that the third related to
 10 property wouldn't trigger the statute.
 11 MR. DE NICOLA: No, Your Honor. The way the statute
 12 is written is that if the prior felonies meet the statutory
 13 definition of being serious or violent -- if you have two of
 14 those, then any new felony triggers the three-strike sentence.
 15 QUESTION: 
 Even if you -- if you had, say, a murder 16 conviction and a rape conviction and then you committed a
 17 wobbler that was a property crime? Would the statute treat
 18 that as a third strike?
 19 MR. DE NICOLA: Yes, because wobblers are felonies,
 20 by definition, in California, and any felony qualifies.
 21 QUESTION: Regardless of the character of the first
 22 two strikes.
 23 MR. DE NICOLA: As long as the first two strikes
 24 meet the level of being serious or violent, which --
 25 QUESTION: I see. So -- and there's no requirement

33

1 that it be related to property. I misunderstood.
 2 MR. DE NICOLA: No, Your Honor.
 3 QUESTION: All right.
 4 QUESTION: Also, I don't know how to work with
 5 felony and misdemeanor, because, across the nation, my
 6 impression is that those are classified in very different
 7 ways, and they're classified sometimes according to the prison
 8 that you serve in, as in Massachusetts, and sometimes you can
 9 find a felony that, in ordinary common sense, is a lot less
 10 serious than certain misdemeanors. That's why I'm very pushed
 11 to know what to work with unless you work with empirical fact.
 12 MR. DE NICOLA: Well, we -- in California, the
 13 felony is defined by the -- not just the locus of where the
 14 term will be served, but also by the length. It's more than a
 15 year. 
 And we think that that's a traditional line of 16 demarcation between offenses that, over the course of time,
 17 society deems to be of elevated seriousness.
 18 QUESTION: I think some of our constitutional
 19 jurisprudence makes it -- makes -- turns upon the distinction
 20 between felonies and misdemeanors, doesn't it?
 21 MR. DE NICOLA: Yes, Your Honor, I think that is so,
 22 and there are political restraints on the legislature in
 23 enacting laws in general applicability. There are certainly
 24 economic restraints on a legislature in deciding to set a
 25 punishment scheme that provides for long terms of

34

1 imprisonment. That's costly. And that to -- for a court to
 2 second-guess that, comes, we think, perilously close to the
 3 court suggesting that the legislature can, in some instances,
 4 not declare a certain crime to be a felony, but must declare
 5 it to be a misdemeanor, and we don't think there's anything in
 6 the Court's jurisprudence that would -- that would support
 7 that type of an intrusion.
 8 QUESTION: Mr. De Nicola, there's a lot of
 9 discretion built into this scheme. It comes across as three
 10 strikes and you're out, and that's it; but it's not. There's
 11 discretion in the prosecutor and discretion in the judge. Are
 12 there, in Los Angeles or in California, any guides to
 13 prosecutors in exercising their discretion, say, whether to
 14 treat a wobbler as a misdemeanor or a felony?
 15 MR. DE NICOLA: 
 There are no statewide standards. 16 Each elected district attorney in the various counties in
 17 California has the option of promulgating guidelines. Some of
 18 them have. And the fact of the matter is some of them -- some
 19 of them differ. We think that's a rather unremarkable event
 20 in light of the fact that prosecutorial discretion is always
 21 going to lead to some sort of different approach depending on
 22 local conditions. But there is not, as far as I know, any
 23 statewide guideline, and certainly nothing that would be
 24 binding on the local prosecutors.
 25 QUESTION: The prosecutor can charge something as a

35

1 misdemeanor. As far as the striking a strike is concerned, is
 2 that solely for the judge? Or, I suppose, it depends on
 3 what's charged. The prosecutor can decide not to charge two
 4 strikes.
 5 MR. DE NICOLA: Yes, the prosecutor, under the
 6 statute, is required to allege the priors, but the prosecutor
 7 may seek dismissal of the prior strikes either in the
 8 furtherance of justice, or because of problems of proof. But
 9 the judge also has authority to strike strikes, even without
 10 the consent of the prosecutor, in California. And so --
 11 QUESTION: And similarly, to reduce a wobbler to a
 12 misdemeanor.
 13 MR. DE NICOLA: Yes, the prosecutor, in a way, has
 14 that discretion, because he or she can charge a -- an
 15 alternative felony or misdemeanor as a misdemeanor in the 16 first place, but even under the three-strikes law, the trial
 17 judge retains the discretion to sentence a -- an alternative
 18 felony misdemeanor as a misdemeanor, and that would take the
 19 case out of the three-strikes scope.
 20 QUESTION: May I ask you a question about your
 21 theory of the limits of the constitutional protection here? 
 22 Supposing the offense was speeding -- and it can be dangerous
 23 speeding -- and you had a -- you said that -- 15 arrests for
 24 speeding gives you this very sentence we got in this case. 
 25 Would that be permissible, do you think? Just on the theory

36

1 that Justice Scalia has explained -- where this guy is just
 2 too dangerous, we just don't want him on the street anymore,
 3 so we'll put him in jail for life, 25 years without
 4 possibility of parole.
 5 MR. DE NICOLA: Well, we think that might possibly
 6 be constitutional, Your Honor. I --
 7 QUESTION: Possibly be constitutional or
 8 unconstitutional?
 9 MR. DE NICOLA: Might possibly be constitutional. I
 10 think it's more likely that it would 
 11 be --
 12 QUESTION: Well, why wouldn't it clearly be
 13 constitutional if we're thinking about protecting the public
 14 from repetitive offenders?
 15 MR. DE NICOLA: 
 Well, because I think the limiting 16 principle that we're seeking here, Your Honor, is one that's
 17 premised on the felony classification. If 
 18 the --
 19 QUESTION: Do you think the statute would have been
 20 unconstitutional if they had said it's a misdemeanor when it's
 21 $1200 -- if the legislature just, say, called the three golf
 22 clubs for $1200 by a misdemeanor instead of by felony, would
 23 that change the constitutional analysis?
 24 MR. DE NICOLA: It -- I think it would make the
 25 constitutional -- it might change the constitutional analysis. 

37

1 It might make the result different. I think, again, once you
 2 have the predicate in place of the serious or violent
 3 felonies, then I think the reason you're --
 4 QUESTION: But serious or violent -- it really
 5 doesn't have to be violent; it has to serious. But you could
 6 have had $1200 thefts, four or five of them, and he would
 7 still qualify, wouldn't he?
 8 MR. DE NICOLA: No, Your Honor. If -- the prior
 9 crimes have to qualify as serious or violent under the
 10 definitions of a separate statutory scheme, so they would
 11 not --
 12 QUESTION: But are there not serious crimes that are
 13 not violent?
 14 MR. DE NICOLA: Yes, I think that's true. There are
 15 serious crimes where no injury is inflicted, but the crimes, I 16 think, by their nature, tend to be crimes where the prospect
 17 of violence is rather imminent.
 18 QUESTION: But they're -- I'm just trying to -- I'm
 19 trying to understand the theory. Is violence an absolute
 20 requirement, in your view, in one of the priors?
 21 MR. DE NICOLA: No, I think -- I think --
 22 QUESTION: Okay. So then we could have something
 23 equivalent -- maybe instead of $1200, $2000 or something. But
 24 if you just had five -- or three or four $2,000 burglaries,
 25 that -- do you -- would that be permissible to put him in jail

38

1 on the same sentence that you have in this case?
 2 MR. DE NICOLA: I -- again, Your Honor, I -- it's
 3 a -- it's a much tougher call. I think it might be
 4 permissible to do it, provided that the sentence allows for a
 5 possibility of parole, after the --
 6 QUESTION: After 25 years.
 7 MR. DE NICOLA: Yes. That would distinguish it from
 8 Solem, Your Honor. But nevertheless, here, the predicate,
 9 even though the prior crimes don't necessarily have to involve
 10 the actual infliction of violence, they are crimes that by
 11 their nature --
 12 QUESTION: But in your view, violence is really more
 13 significant than the number of prior offenses, if I understand
 14 you correctly.
 15 MR. DE NICOLA: 
 Well, I think it might be a sliding 16 scale, but I think violence does play a significant role and
 17 can justify a scheme like this, even in the absence --
 18 QUESTION: Okay.
 19 MR. DE NICOLA: -- of a great number of priors.
 20 QUESTION: But you -- but I'm not quite sure what
 21 your view would be if there were no violence, but just seven
 22 or eight high-speed offenses, say, speeding, or $1200 golf
 23 clubs.
 24 MR. DE NICOLA: Well, we think a lot would depend on
 25 whether the legislature in the jurisdiction had determined

39

1 for -- for -- on an historical basis and for reasons
 2 independent --
 3 QUESTION: Well, speeding is dangerous. People get
 4 hurt in automobile accidents. It seems to me it's exactly the
 5 same risk to the public that you have with this kind of crime.
 6 MR. DE NICOLA: But we think -- if the legislature
 7 declares those to be a felony, then I think we become a lot --
 8 we come a lot closer to --
 9 QUESTION: It depends on what the legislature calls
 10 the offense.
 11 MR. DE NICOLA: Yes, it does, Your Honor, in a very
 12 significant respect, because what the legislature calls the
 13 offense in connection with it being a misdemeanor or a felony
 14 does reflect, we think, a reliable longstanding consensus of
 15 the -- of the community. 
 And under the Harmelin principles of 16 deference and reliance and objective factors, we think that's
 17 a prominent objective factor.
 18 QUESTION: On Justice Stevens' hypo, taking it one
 19 step further, I guess we would have to say that if there were
 20 15 prior speeding offenses, and they had been classified as
 21 felonies in California, that there was no disproportion
 22 between 25-to-life for 15 -- with a predicate of 15 prior
 23 speeding offenses, on the one hand, and the penalties for
 24 torture and murder, on the other hand. Because I think it's
 25 undisputed that the only standalone penalties that are this

40

1 great are the penalties for torture and homicide. That would
 2 be rather a stretch, wouldn't it, regardless of whether the
 3 legislature wants to put a felony label on them or not?
 4 MR. DE NICOLA: Well, again, Your Honor --
 5 QUESTION: Speeding's important, but --
 6 MR. DE NICOLA: Yes.
 7 QUESTION: -- I mean, torture and murder?
 8 MR. DE NICOLA: I do think that it is a much tougher
 9 case for us, and I'm not at all certain that it would be
 10 constitutional if all of the crimes, the predicate through the
 11 new crime, were simply speeding. I think --
 12 QUESTION: Might it be an abuse of the judge's
 13 discretion not to reduce such a -- if it's a wobbler, in such
 14 a case, or not to strike a strike?
 15 MR. DE NICOLA: Well, I don't -- in the California
 16 context, the question would only arise -- well, I don't think
 17 it would arise at all, because you wouldn't have a speeding --
 18 even as a predicate, any felony-triggering offense, and the
 19 speeding wouldn't qualify as a serious or violent felony under
 20 the statute anyway. So this hypothetical is very far removed
 21 from the three-strikes scheme that California has in place.
 22 QUESTION: I would have thought that your response
 23 to Justice Souter would have been that it might seem
 24 disproportionate insofar as the penal goal of punishment or
 25 retribution is concerned, but it depends on what you want your

41

1 penal goals to be. California has decided that disabling the
 2 criminal is the most important thing, and in -- from that
 3 point of view, it's not necessarily disproportionate. The one
 4 is disabled as the other.
 5 MR. DE NICOLA: Well --
 6 QUESTION: I mean, proportionality -- you
 7 necessarily have to look upon what the principal objective of
 8 the punishment is. If the objective of -- if the objective is
 9 retribution, then, sure, I guess it's disproportionate to
 10 execute somebody for killing only one person, when you do no
 11 more than execute somebody for killing 20 people. But if your
 12 purpose is disabling the criminal, I'm not sure that it --
 13 that the example that Justice Souter gave is disproportionate.
 14 MR. DE NICOLA: Well, again, Your Honor, I don't --
 15 I don't think I would absolutely concede that it would be 16 unconstitutional. I'm just saying that --
 17 QUESTION: Well, do you adopt Justice Scalia's
 18 analysis? I mean, this came up in the briefs, and this was an
 19 interesting point. Does the State, for purposes of
 20 proportionality analysis, have the option to adopt a different
 21 theory of penalty? And he's given an example. Do you -- do
 22 you adopt that argument here? And do you think that is a
 23 justification that you want to rely on in this case?
 24 MR. DE NICOLA: Yes, we do adopt the theory of
 25 incapacitation, and we do rely on incapacitation as a theory

42

1 that justifies the sentence in this case.
 2 QUESTION: All right. Here's the problem that I
 3 have with that, and this is -- this is -- this is what I wish
 4 you would address. If we allow, for purposes of
 5 proportionality or gross disproportionality analysis, this
 6 kind of -- the consideration of varying intentions --
 7 retribution, incapacitation, deterrence, and so on -- and
 8 every time the State gets to a very high offense, the State
 9 says, "Oh, we've changed the theory. We've gone from
 10 deterrence to retribution," it seems to me that it makes this
 11 kind of analysis of comparables -- this proportionality
 12 analysis -- impossible because we no longer have two
 13 comparable entities on either side of our comparison. What we
 14 have is a low sentence on the one hand for deterrence, and a
 15 high sentence for incapacitation or retribution. We have
 16 apples and oranges instead of oranges and oranges.
 17 So my question is, if we accept the State's option
 18 to say, "We've changed the theory," don't we read
 19 comparability analysis right out of the law? Doesn't it
 20 simply become logically impossible?
 21 MR. DE NICOLA: Well, I think it becomes much more
 22 difficult, but I don't think it necessarily becomes logically
 23 impossible, because I think there is still room for judicial
 24 scrutiny, within the context of the Harmelin narrow
 25 proportionality principle, to take a hard look --

43

1 QUESTION: But my problem is, I don't know what
 2 we're supposed to -- what we can compare for comparable
 3 examples on proportionality analysis if it can be
 4 fundamentally affected by the State's change of intention from
 5 one theory in one crime, or one set of penalties, to another
 6 theory in another set of penalties. I don't see what we can
 7 compare. We no longer have comparables.
 8 MR. DE NICOLA: Well, but I think the Court can
 9 still look at whether the phenomenon of -- as in this case, of
 10 heightened recidivism based on prior violence, or serious
 11 offenses threatening violence and triggered by a new crime
 12 that, say -- that's classified as a felony by the legislature
 13 and that offers a sentence of -- a lengthy sentence, but that
 14 still offers a possibility of 
 15 parole --
 16 QUESTION: I guess the conclusion that Justice
 17 Souter's questions would lead to is that a State cannot use
 18 any factor except retribution. Or if it uses any other
 19 factor, it does so at the risk of our simply holding it to be
 20 disproportionate.
 21 MR. DE NICOLA: Yes, Your Honor --
 22 QUESTION: And I don't know that our -- I'm sure
 23 that our cases don't support that.
 24 MR. DE NICOLA: It -- and I acknowledge it -- to
 25 Justice Souter, it makes it a very difficult situation. But

44

1 under Harmelin, those, I think, are penological objectives
 2 that the Judiciary ought to defer to the State.
 3 QUESTION: But maybe -- maybe, and I -- we've -- we
 4 haven't said this -- maybe our assumption is that the State,
 5 in establishing a penal system, is going to establish it on a
 6 set of consistent and neutral principles from beginning to
 7 end. Would that be a legitimate basis for us to ground our
 8 constitutional analysis?
 9 MR. DE NICOLA: No, Your Honor. It disables the
 10 states from changing -- from dealing with changing conditions.
 11 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. De Nicola.
 12 Mr. Chertoff, we'll hear from you.
 13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL CHERTOFF
 14 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 15 MR. CHERTOFF: 
 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 16 the Court: I think the last series of questions which Justice
 17 Souter posed to Mr. De Nicola really framed the issue in light
 18 of this case's most recent pronouncement in Harmelin -- this
 19 Court's most recent pronouncement in Harmelin.
 20 I would have read Harmelin as establishing two
 21 principles, at a minimum. One is, the analysis is not
 22 proportionality; it's gross disproportionality, an extremely
 23 rare basis to invalidate a statute. Second, we recognize that
 24 the states are entitled to adopt different penological
 25 theories, or a mix of theories. In fact, I would have thought

45

1 that a state's entitled to say, for example, that certain
 2 types of crimes ought to be addressed in terms of retribution;
 3 other types of crimes posing other kinds of issues can be
 4 dealt with in terms of deterrence and incapacitation.
 5 And if the consequence of that principle is that
 6 this Court has very limited review on comparability of
 7 sentences, at least where you're dealing with sentences that
 8 allow for the possibility of parole, then I think the
 9 conclusion is that it is the extremely rare case in which a
 10 sentence gets --
 11 QUESTION: Well, why isn't that this case? I mean,
 12 I don't know how to approach proportionality other than to
 13 say, what sentences are given for the same crime, or what
 14 crimes are treated with the same sentence?
 15 Now, suppose, looking at that, I find this is the 16 rare case. If it isn't, why isn't it? I mean, all the
 17 information we have, as I've said before, seems to suggest
 18 that this is higher by a factor of two or three times anything
 19 else you can find. 
 20 MR. CHERTOFF: Well --
 21 QUESTION: Now, if that isn't grossly
 22 disproportionate, why isn't it?
 23 MR. CHERTOFF: It's not for several reasons, Your
 24 Honor. First of all, although there's nothing in the record
 25 to speak to what the pre-1977 proportions were in terms of

46

1 sentencing, we do know, for example, that elsewhere in the
 2 country there have been comparable sentences. We've cited in
 3 the United States --
 4 QUESTION: Cited a lot of instances in which the law
 5 permits such a sentence, but that's quite different from
 6 saying there was such a sentence.
 7 MR. CHERTOFF: Actually, I think in footnote 13,
 8 we've cited several cases in other states where you have very
 9 comparable punishments, where you have larcenies between 4-
 10 and $700 as the third strike --
 11 QUESTION: And do you have instances where people
 12 were sentenced to 25 real years in prison for having committed
 13 such an offense? Or were you citing that the law would permit
 14 such a sentence?
 15 MR. CHERTOFF: 
 We cited review and rejection of 16 disproportionality challenges in one case in Nevada to a life
 17 sentence without parole for a grand larceny of --
 18 QUESTION: Good, okay, thank you.
 19 MR. CHERTOFF: -- $476, and a similar one, I think,
 20 in South Dakota.
 21 Also, of course, as we look at the current
 22 sentencing regime, this is not, as in Solem versus Helm, where
 23 you have single judge who is apparently an outlier under the
 24 state sentencing scheme. In this case, if one takes, in fact,
 25 a petitioner's own figures, you have at least 2- to 300

47

1 individuals whose third strike, under the California scheme as
 2 it now exists, has, in fact, been a property-based crime.
 3 And I think the most compelling reason why this is
 4 not that very, very rare case where we strike down a sentence
 5 is precisely what Justice Ginsburg has been repeatedly asking
 6 about, the discretion that the courts have to tailor the
 7 particular sentence in this case to the facts of the case. If
 8 we look at the record in this case, in the joint appendix, the
 9 sentencing judge carefully considered the entirety of the file
 10 with respect to the trigger -- or the predicate offenses,
 11 which involved, actually, three burglaries in the course of a
 12 single month, one of which involved pulling a knife and
 13 threatening somebody, as well as at least nine prior offenses.
 14 And interestingly, in no case since 1988 had the
 15 petitioner ever successfully completed probation or parole. 16 He was always violating probation or parole by committing his
 17 next offense. And that's precisely what the sentencing judge
 18 looked at and explicitly referred to in rejecting the request
 19 on the part of the petitioner either to downgrade the
 20 triggering offense to a misdemeanor, or to eliminate some of
 21 the strikes.
 22 And I would have thought that is precisely what we
 23 expect and want judges to do in a rational sentencing system.
 24 QUESTION: In effect, you're -- going back to the
 25 beginning of your argument, I think you're -- I think you're

48

1 saying that what the judge here did in rejecting the request
 2 to downgrade or to disregard, in effect, was saying, "Yes, I
 3 am finding that this is a case in which it is appropriate to
 4 sentence on an entirely different theory, a theory of putting
 5 them away, as opposed to a theory of deterrence," and I --
 6 that seems to be the logic of what's going on.
 7 MR. CHERTOFF: That's correct; an entirely different
 8 theory, though, that is embraced by the State in passing this
 9 law.
 10 QUESTION: And may I ask you one more question on
 11 that? Because again, you started toward it in responding to
 12 me at the beginning. Like you, I came in here assuming that
 13 the State could change its theories. If that is so, then I
 14 guess what that means for proportionate or gross
 15 disproportionality analysis is this: 
 A State can do it and 16 can pass our Eight Amendment test if it has a reasonable basis
 17 for saying, "We are going, under certain circumstances, to say
 18 there is a changed theory of sentencing. The theory changes
 19 from deterrence or mere retribution to a theory or public
 20 protection, putting away the person who simply will repeat and
 21 repeat and repeat."
 22 So, for purposes of our proportionality analysis,
 23 the question would come down, do they have a reasonable basis
 24 for doing that under their statute, in general? And in
 25 particular, is there a reasonable basis for saying that this

49

1 is a case for that? And if the answers to those two questions
 2 are yes, then it passes the test. Is that -- would you adopt
 3 that analysis?
 4 MR. CHERTOFF: I would absolutely agree that if it
 5 satisfies those two, it passes the test. That's not to say
 6 that if it flunks those, it automatically fails the test. But
 7 certainly if you meet those conditions, I think you pass the
 8 test. And I think there's a common sense to that.
 9 One could look, for example, at certain types of
 10 violent crimes, like murders and rapes and say, irrespective
 11 of whether it was a crime of passion or something that will
 12 never happen again, "It is so heinous, our philosophy is we
 13 have to punish it." But one can also look at comparatively
 14 small crimes, at least if they're felonies, and say, "If
 15 someone is repetitiously unable to conform their conduct to 16 the requirements of the law, we don't have to wait until he
 17 commits the next felony or the next two felonies before we put
 18 an end to it."
 19 And interestingly, if one goes back to Blackstone,
 20 who talks a little bit about the issue of proportionality as
 21 it related back in his day, he discusses the fact that when
 22 you deal with habitual offenders, it would be cruel to the
 23 public to simply allow that person to get out again and commit
 24 their next crime.
 25 So, I don't know that it's so much that the State

50

1 changes its theory, as that the State adapts its theory to the
 2 particular type of crime and particular type of offender. And
 3 that's, of course, what we want to have in sentencing.
 4 And, finally, I would say this. In a scheme like
 5 California, where the state judge has the power to tailor to
 6 the particular offender and the particular offense what the
 7 right answer is, for the federal courts to come in under gross
 8 disproportionality analysis and recalibrate that -- even if,
 9 sitting as state trial judges, the justices might feel we
 10 would do it differently -- would be essentially converting the
 11 courts into a constitutional sentencing commission. And if
 12 one looks at the companion case --
 13 QUESTION: Excuse me, would be essentially 
 14 to --
 15 MR. CHERTOFF: 
 Convert the court into a 16 constitutional sentencing commission. Doing the kind of
 17 analysis that we now have, a sentencing commission --
 18 QUESTION: And that would be a very bad thing. I
 19 agree.
 20 (Laughter.) 
 21 MR. CHERTOFF: It would be a -- certainly very
 22 complicated thing, Justice Breyer.
 23 So -- and if one looks at the companion case,
 24 Andrade, and the subsequent cases in the Ninth Circuit that
 25 have flowed from that case, one sees this phenomenon beginning

51

1 to emerge, where every fact pattern is evaluated slightly
 2 differently. One court views burglary as being a violent
 3 offense; one court says it's not a violent offense.
 4 QUESTION: Could you argue that, because discretion
 5 is consistent with the goals of the statute before the
 6 sentencing, that some discretion is also permitted to a
 7 reviewing court after the sentencing, and they can still
 8 maintain the symmetry and the purpose of the statute?
 9 MR. CHERTOFF: The state law could certainly provide
 10 for some kind of review as a matter of state sentencing law in
 11 terms of abuse of discretion by the sentencing judge.
 12 QUESTION: But in this -- in California, does the
 13 appellate court ever set aside sentences on the ground there
 14 was an abuse of discretion to invoke the three strikes law?
 15 MR. CHERTOFF: 
 I know of cases where they have 16 affirmed trial judges that have set aside strikes. I don't
 17 know of a case --
 18 QUESTION: No, I -- has -- has a trial judge ever
 19 been set aside for imposing the third strike?
 20 MR. CHERTOFF: I'm not aware of it.
 21 QUESTION: I don't think --
 22 MR. CHERTOFF: I'm not aware --
 23 QUESTION: -- there are any --
 24 MR. CHERTOFF: -- of such a case. Certainly the
 25 state law could allow that to happen.

52

1 If there are no further questions, I will return the
 2 rest of my time to the Court.
 3 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Chertoff.
 4 Mr. Denvir, you have one minute remaining.
 5 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF QUIN DENVIR
 6 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 7 MR. DENVIR: Your Honor, the point I -- I'd like to
 8 make two points. One is, if the discretion in -- under the
 9 California law is very limited. One thing would be to treat a
 10 wobbler, if it is a wobbler, and reduce it to a misdemeanor;
 11 so you would go from 25 to life, or life, to one-year maximum
 12 penalty. That's not used very often. The other one is to
 13 strike a prior conviction. But that's a -- the California
 14 Supreme Court in Romero said that's a very limited discretion,
 15 that it is only when you can find that this offender is 16 outside the "spirit of the law," whatever that is. And
 17 there's an amicus brief filed by the Los Angeles public
 18 defender in Romero that shows that that discretion has been
 19 used very little in California. So the -- this limited
 20 discretion has no effect on it.
 21 The only other point I'd make, as far as the
 22 repetition -- as far as the labeling, if all the legislature
 23 has to do is say, "What we're doing here is incapacitation,
 24 and, therefore, the Court can't look at that," then it really
 25 writes the Eighth Amendment protections against grossly

53

1 disproportional sentences out totally. If it's just a
 2 question of -- they say, "Here's our reason," and you can't
 3 even question that, because they can always claim they want to
 4 incapacitate any criminal for any amount of time.
 5 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Denvir. The
 6 case is submitted.
 7 (Whereupon, at 11:09 a.m., the case in the
 8 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
