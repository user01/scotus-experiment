    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court,in the unanimous opinion in Freedman versus Maryland this court stated that when the government imposes a permit requirement on the exercise of free speech, that permit scheme must include certain procedural safeguards which are there, quite obviously, to prevent the unwarranted and perhaps unlawful delay or suppression of speech that might occur without them."

    "speaker": "REHNQUIST",
    "speech": "I have to say that thinking about the case, I suppose analytically this is a prior restraint. And we have said that there s a heavy presumption within validity. But on the other hand, it s a content based time, place and manner regulation, and we have sustained these in case after case, and you want to make this a Freedman case. Freedman was a case where you had to submit your speech to prior examination, prior submission of speech, and it was in that context, and the Court was very clear, as I recall, in Freedman to say when -- there must be prior submission of speech, then you have to have the procedures Freedman set forth, so I think you're really stretching our precedents, particularly Freedman, to put Freedman in your case. It's true you may have some other arguments, if there were some content-based suppression going on, but this isn't a Freedman case. Our authorities just don't allow us to make that leap."

    "speech": "Justice Kennedy, with respect, I could not disagree with you more, and I think we can look at a few cases to show that this is surely a prior restraint case, and the one that comes to mind most readily is where that exact same question was presented to this Court when, in FW/PBS v. The City of Dallas, the Fifth Circuit had held that the Dallas licensing scheme, which was content-neutral, period, in all regards, which a content-neutral licensing scheme licensing sexually oriented business in Dallas, was a time, place, and manner restriction, and this Court rejected that approach and said, first we find that it is an unlawful prior restraint, and therefore it is --"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I think your premise may be one that we're going to have trouble adopting. This is use of a public park. It is limited in terms of size and space, and presumably there may well be competing interests trying to use the park at the very same time, when it can't accommodate every possible use at all times. Now, is there no way that the park can attempt to find rules of the game so that everybody gets accommodated?"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But just answer whether that is possible, under First Amendment time, place, and manner doctrine. Yes, it's public space, and yes, it is political speech, but is it a possible time, place, and manner regulation to say a group of 300 wants to use it Tuesday, we have to sort out who gets it and when? Is that not possible?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "Certainly, Justice O'Connor, that's possible. What we complain about is when the Government can say, we will decide who gets to use the park, particularly when the scheme is such, when it lacks the kind of standards required that the Government can make that choice improperly."

Justice O'Connor gave you the simplest time, place, and manner regulation that's content-neutral, if there are two groups that want a use a space that hold 100 and they're each 100, do you have to sort out the two. That is not a Freedman case. Sure, I suppose if you push us to the wall it's a prior restraint. Of course there are cases that say that prior restraints have a heavy burden.

It goes no further. In this case, however, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to show that you meet the qualifications because of the behind-closed-doors way that this permit scheme is imposed and implemented, and this case presents the perfect example. As the Court knows from the record in this case, Mr. McDonald vehemently and categorically denied that he had done those things which under the code would deny him a permit, but that made no difference. Not only did the park district say that as far as we are concerned you did it, and you are not entitled to speak, that prevents you, in our opinion, from ever speaking in a park for the rest of your life, and anyone associated with you."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

You don't have a record of uneven applications, and beyond that, I would really like to know what is your idea of a scheme that would be compatible with the First Amendment. In answer to Justice O'Connor you said yes, they can have rules of the road, so there aren't too many people at any time, that there aren't colliding events. What scheme do you say is necessary to meet the First Amendment?"

    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "First, in direct answer to Justice O'Connor's inquiry, a scheme that says you may not obtain a permit for an event at a day and time for which another permit has already been issued, no question. There's no complaint that anyone could have."

    "speech": "Well, you're saying the most precious speech. Are you suggesting that if, say, somebody wanted to have a softball game in the park and they applied, and your client wanted to have a speech in the park, and he applied, that your client should be given some sort of a preference over the softball game because it's free speech, or --"

What if -- what about the situation where you have several people who want to get in for a time that has not yet been committed to anybody. would certainly help the situation and, of course, these permit applications are dated, time-dated and time-stamped when they are submitted, but there is no requirement that it be first come, first served."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Okay, we've got the collision at the door. If the tie-breaker rule is political speech always wins, your problem doesn't arise. If there isn't that tie-breaker rule, it seems to me, there is enough discretion left to be a violation on your view."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, maybe, but I'd like to know what the principle is that you want us to apply, and I think the principle that you want us to apply means that when they bump each other's foreheads at the door, political speech has got to win, or there's an unconstitutional discretion left, amounting to the possibility of a prior restraint. If that's wrong, tell me why it's wrong."

    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "I believe that's wrong because -- well, first of all, again, we're not going to find that situation, but let's assume we did, and they bump their heads on the way in. First come, first served is a reasonable approach, if that is a concrete and consistently --"
  },
  {

    "speech": "Mr. Wilson, where -- where? You say, the Government goes to court. The park district goes to court and shows that there's no conflict with the First Amendment. The court you're assuming, I gather, if you're following the Freedman mode, is a State court, and yet from this very litigation it seems that you prefer the Federal court, so how would a Freedman scheme do you any good at all, considering that your preferred forum is the Federal court, and I don't think, if the Government brought that case, if the park district brought that case in the State court, wouldn't you be stuck there?"

It's a burden that the Government ought to bear in core political speech cases, and it is not a great burden.

Our view, which we think is really the only reasonable reading of the ordinance, is that we can exercise discretion, as it were, within the criteria, so that if there is a way to grant the application that -- an application that is in violation that does not defeat the purpose of the conditions, we will try to do that. Let me be more concrete about it. The place where this comes up most frequently is with a late application, and --"

In fact, they're habitually not met by, in Justice Black's terms from Oregon v. City of Struthers, the poorly who often get their applications in late, and the park district's view is, if it's -- if we can make the necessary accommodations, and do the necessary setup and necessary coordination and free the space for you, even though your application is late, we will do it, and that's the kind of discretion we exercise."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Would there have been discretion in this case? Let's assume the only prior violation had been the fact that if that earlier gathering people were still hanging around at 11:00, after -- or after 11:00 when the park closed. Would there have been discretion to forgive that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRAUSS",
    "speech": "Yes, there would have been, if we had concluded that -- if the applicant said to us something that gave us reason to believe it wouldn't happen again, or if the nature of the event were such that it was scheduled earlier in the day, or something like that, that it wouldn't happen again, or if it happened again it wouldn't be so much of a problem, but we don't assert, and I don't think you can assert, consistent with the ordinance, a kind of free-floating discretion to overlook violations for people we like and not for people we don't like. I think that would be a violation of the ordinance. permits are granted and how many denied each year by the park?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRAUSS",
    "speech": "Justice O'Connor, on the grants, the record, the most precise number we have in the record is there are thousands of applications and thousands of grants a year. We submitted to the Court the permits in our lodging, the permits granted from January through August of this year, and there were over 1,000 of those in one region of the park."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "How about denials?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRAUSS",
    "speech": "Denials, Justice O'Connor, is a hard number to come up with, and this bears on the Freedman v. Maryland point, because what often happens is that the denial takes the form of saying, we can't accommodate you at this space at this time, but if you're willing to move your event a week later, or willing to move it to this alternative site, then we can accommodate you. Now, I suppose that's a denial, because we're not granting the permit applied for, and I suppose if petitioner prevails we would have to go to court and defend that denial, which seems a really unworkable scheme, but because of that the park district really can't -- couldn't tell me how many denials there are, forward in a different time or place than that which was applied for. I think there are really three ways in which this case differs from Freedman v. Maryland. One which was suggested by some questions from the Court, perhaps the most important one, of course, is in Freedman the Board of Censors, self-described Board of Censors was explicitly concerned with the content of speech. We are not only not concerned with the content of speech, we are not concerned with whether the event involves speech or expressive activity at all, and if you look at the application form, unless the applicant somehow discloses it, there is really no way for us to know from the application form what kind, whether this is a speech- related event or not. The box that Mr. McDonald checked was named corporate/festival, which could include a variety of events not involving speech."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRAUSS",
    "speech": "Justice O'Connor, it was denied for multiple reasons. It was denied partly because it wasn't filled out properly. The form omitted information, partly because one of the applicants was not an organization that had the capacity to sue or be sued, and also because of a series of violations of which that was only one. There was also --"

    "speech": "Are there administrative mechanisms in place for someone who wants to challenge the basis for the denial to raise it administratively?"

    "speech": "Yes, there is, Justice O'Connor. There's a provision for an appeal to the general superintendent of the park district from the decision made by the permitting officers in the park district, and you can submit any material you like to the general superintendent, who must rule on it promptly. If he doesn't rule on it promptly, then the appeal is deemed allowed."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I take it that's the second distinction from Freedman."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRAUSS",
    "speech": "Well, the second distinction from Freedman -- that is a distinction, Justice Souter, but the second distinction really is that a key premise of Freedman is that the decision in question was one that the courts had superior competence to make, and that the agency was to be distrusted in making. The Court said the decision was whether the speech was constitutionally protected or is obscene, and a theme of Freedman is, as the Court said in Freedman, a censor's business is to censor, and this is really something that requires, in the Court's words, judicial participation. What we're dealing with here is the management of parks, where I think the story is reversed, and when you're dealing with whether a particular use is appropriate for this area of the park with this infrastructure, this is the kind of park district has superior competence with, and there's really no reason to insist, as the Court did on judicial --"

    "speaker": "STRAUSS",
    "speech": "Justice Souter, that clause, two things about that clause are salient, I think. First, that clause only comes into play, the clause that provides that we shall waive certain fees when someone is engaged in First Amendment activity and otherwise couldn't hold the event if we didn't waive the fees, that only comes into play if someone applies for a waiver, so we're in a situation where someone has come to us in order to seek this dispensation, has told us we're engaging in expressive activity, and the second thing --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And the third distinction that you want to rely on?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRAUSS",
    "speech": "The third distinction, Justice Souter, is that in the Freedman context the Court had indicated a strong preference for after-the-fact regulation, that if the -- if a community is concerned about obscenity, the way to regulate that is by after- the-fact criminal prohibitions. Prior restraints are strongly disfavored and be allowed only in narrowly hedged circumstances, but the Court has never suggested that when it comes to managing parks, the preferred way to do it is somehow by allowing people to do what they will and then punish people after the fact who have done the wrong thing, who have conducted an event in a way that conflicted with another event."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Strauss, you've ably distinguished Freedman, but do you think that none of the procedural safeguards that were involved in Freedman are applicable here, starting with the basics, the administrator has to have some time limits to act on these"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRAUSS",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, I would put that part of Freedman in a different category. I think that the requirement that the administrator act within a specified period is a corollary of the rule that the administrator cannot have unlimited discretion over whether to grant or deny. Just as unlimited discretion over whether to grant is a problem, unlimited discretion over when to grant is a problem."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I think there's considerable merit, what you have just said, although at the end of the brief you make the final argument that this is really not a speech statute anyway. Am I to infer from that that you think we could write an opinion to say that neutral standards are not necessary?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRAUSS",
    "speech": "Yes. That was going to be the second part of my answer to Justice Ginsburg, Justice Kennedy. That is our position. Our claim does not hinge on that. The Court could disagree with us on that and still rule in our favor in this case, but it is our position that because this statute applies, this ordinance applies so broadly to such a wide range of conduct, much of which, most of which is not expressive, that it really should be viewed as more like a business license, or a building permit, which, of course --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The easy way to answer that argument is to say we've never done this with reference to parks."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRAUSS",
    "speech": "Well, that's right, Justice Kennedy, but as some of the questions from the Court suggested during my colleague's argument, because these are parks, perhaps the Government has more leeway than it would have in telling people what they can do on their own property. I understand that on the other hand they are public forums, and I am not sure how that -- whether those arguments cancel out, but it seems to me the crucial fact here is that the park district is not only not engaged in the business of censoring speech, it is at the far extreme from that, and it is regulating conduct because it affects the infrastructure of the parks, and uses of the parks, and much of this conduct is in no obvious way expressive, and in our view that seems to make it more like a business license."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But you did say that you feel some compulsion from the First Amendment to have to make a decision within a set time to guard against abuse of discretion. You said that. How about, need there be any avenue for judicial review after we get through with your park administrator?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STRAUSS",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, I think -- well, for anyone claiming a violation of a constitutional right, there should be an avenue for prompt judicial review, and further, I think that part of Freedman is intended to deal with that situation like that present in some of this Court's cases, in FW/PBS and in Shuttlesworth in particular, a situation where the applicant can't be quite sure when the permit's been denied, so the applicant doesn't quite know when it's okay to go to court. That was what happened in Shuttlesworth, and I think that troubled the Court, and I think that's the idea that when the Court said in FW/PBS there must be an avenue for prompt judicial review, that's what the Court had in mind, that the permitting scheme cannot be set up in such a way that whenever -- when the applicant goes to Court the permitting authority can then step back and say, oh, we haven't denied the permit yet. Here, it's clear when we deny it. We have to act within a certain number of days. We have to issue a statement. The statement has to give reasons, and there is -- and at that point the decision can be challenged in State court in a variety of ways. It can also be"

I think it's misleading to characterize it as a prior restraint. As Justice Kennedy said, there were some technical definitional way in which yes, it is a prior restraint, but it really has none of the characteristics that have caused the Court to subject prior restraints to the presumption of unconstitutionality. In particular, as I said to Justice Souter, this isn't an area in which the Court has said the preferred way of regulating is by after-the-fact criminal punishments. The Court has always recognized that what common sense tells us, that this an area where you really do need before-the-fact guidance, or at least before-the- fact guidance is acceptable. That, combined with the fact that it's not a content-based -- not only not a content-based scheme, not a content-based scheme that even refers to expression at all, I think gives it none of the characteristics that have troubled the Court about prior restraints, so in light of that, whether it is technically called not a prior restraint, or a valid prior restraint, I think really is a terminological point."

    "speaker": "STRAUSS",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, my reading of the Illinois cases is that that's not true even in State court and, of course, the applicant has the option of going to the Federal court. My reading of the Illinois cases is that you can join a claim for equitable relief with the common law certiorari, which is the Illinois way of reviewing administrative proceedings, and you can certainly -- it's clear you could join a 198 -- a State court in a 1983 action, and that would allow you to conduct full discovery. But I guess my more fundamental answer to your question, Justice Ginsburg, is, it seems odd in this case to speculate about the adequacy of Illinois procedures when petitioner has not invoked them, and has not complained about the adequacy of the Federal proceedings that he has invoked, that the place to decide whether Illinois provides adequate proceedings would be in a case where someone invokes them, and the Court then sees what the Illinois courts are prepared to do in cases of this kind.

    "speech": "Do you think we should view it as Mr. Strauss urges, as a zoning ordinance, or a business license, or as some kind of content-neutral time, place, and manner restriction?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "I think more the latter. This is a public forum. There was a finding -- there may be other Government property that wouldn't fall within that category, but it is a public forum, and restrictions on speech in a public forum are subject to the First Amendment, but the restriction in this ordinance, the relevant restrictions are that the discretion that has to be -- that may be exercised by the administrative body can't be unfettered, but on the other hand, total precision is not required, and I think, as Mr. Strauss explained, there are 13 specified grounds under which a permit may be denied here, and those are the only grounds under which it may be denied, and I think that's adequate guidance for whatever discretion or flexibility would be in the system. And indeed, some flexibility is necessary in a system where you re trying to accommodate competing users and where the alternative, as the Court of Appeals said, if you allowed no flexibility at all, would be even a minor or technical violation of one of those criteria, would have to lead to a denial of a permit, which would mean a lot fewer people using the park, both for speech and for nonspeech purposes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It would make it a lot fairer, wouldn't it? I mean, you either meet the criteria, or you don't. If you don't meet them, you don't get a permit. What's the matter with that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "The problem would be exactly the kind of thing that Mr. Strauss described, is that if there is a minor -- if you put in your permit application slightly too late, or there was a stray mark on your application, requiring total strictness on any of these criteria would just mean that people who really should be entitled to have the opportunity to speak --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, they didn't follow the rules. They don't have discretion to deny, but among those that are deniable, they can allow some in and not allow others in."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "But I think --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why don't you just say, these are the rules, if you come in late, you haven't complied with the rules, period. That's very fair."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "I think as Mr. Strauss -- I think it was Mr. Strauss said, the -- whatever the flexibility or discretion that remains in a system like this would be -- has to be exercised in accordance with those grounds for denial. Those are the only grounds that are listed, and I think those are the only things the park district is supposed to be taking into account in deciding whether to grant or deny a permit, and -- but you can --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "How do you say it doesn't frustrate the purpose of the provision which says, you know, the thing has to be in, you know, 2 weeks beforehand, if you get it in 1 week beforehand? How can you possibly say that doesn't frustrate the purpose of the provision? The purpose is to give you 2 weeks to consider it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "Right, but I think -- well, it could well be that the purpose is to make sure that the park district can guarantee it can consider it, but if they -- if it comes in on a day, 1 day late but there's nothing else on top of it that they're waiting to consider, if it's in the wintertime when they have very few permit applications, they can get to it anyhow, and there's no reason for them not to permit that use of the park. In any event, that's --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Even apart from that, I assume there's no way to write a regulation that is not going to require some judgment, some discretion. I mean, what's material in the falsehood, what is the conflict in the uses? I don't suppose you can eliminate that degree, the degree of flexibility that is implied in applying concepts like that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "I think that's right, and I think a crucial feature of this requirement is that, of the ordinance here is that the parks are used for multiple uses by multiple people. There's a concern with preserving the park's own facilities so that people who will use the same place in the future will have that available to them, and there has to be some availability to accommodate all of that in the normal, in an ordinary administrative scheme, and I think this scheme is well- drawn, and if there are further difficulties with it, they can be challenged on an as-applied basis. One thing the park district can't do is make its kinds of speech."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Would it be --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "That should be addressed on an as- applied basis, and I think it could be in the State court proceedings, or in a 1983 proceeding."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Along the lines of Justice Scalia's question, would it be proper for a city council or municipality to draft an ordinance just like this one and then at the end saying, the commissioner of parks, in his sole discretion, may waive any or all of the foregoing requirements?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "I think the -- the only difficulty -- it would depend on what that meant. If it said, in his sole discretion meant he may consider anything he -- anything, I think that would be -- that would probably be a problem, but if it meant, considering the factors that are the legitimate factors on whether someone should use the park, which are the ones that are set out in the criteria, in the ordinance, I think it would be actually similar to what the ordinance is."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, we've said in a case like Forsyth that discretion has to have some definition and some control to it, and if you have at the end an absolute waiver provision, it seems to me that would contradict that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "Oh, I think -- well, I think that's right. If the meaning of that provision is that notwithstanding what we've just said, the commissioner has absolute discretion, I think that that would be correct, and that would pose a problem under Forsyth and the other cases that have said that you can't have that kind of unfettered discretion. This is a guided -- this is a statute that has quite limited and guided --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, how do we know that? Where does it say that the may, the may grant anyway is limited to those applications that generally meet the purposes of the -- where does it say that? Do we just take your word for it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Or the park district's word for it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "I think that that would at least be the most reasonable construction of an ordinance like this, where there's attempt to detail these 13 specific criteria quite specifically, and there's no suggestion that there's any other basis on which the park district can act, and I think that that's just the most reasonable interpretation of this kind of ordinance. And again on a facial as-applied -- one this is, you don't want to construe it in such a way as to intentionally render it unconstitutional and therefore limit the ability of the park district to make its facilities open, to have a permit scheme that really makes its facilities open to all."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Feldman, do the Federal regulations for the use of Federal parks, the use of the Mall, do they differ with respect to the may deny?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "No. They're -- well, they're very similar. The specific criteria are different, and are differently --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But there is the may deny, implying there are cases where, although you could, you don't have to deny?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "That's correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And no criteria for the waiver in the Federal scheme either?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "No, and the way those have consistently been applied is, those are the grounds that are to be considered in determining whether you can grant a permit, and there aren't other grounds on which a permit would be denied. Now, there -- the only other -- but actually, in the Federal scheme at least, and probably here, too, some types of other -- some types of considerations can be considered. For example, if someone has a particular facility that would be particularly good for one use, if someone wants to hold a rally on a baseball field, someone else wants to have a baseball game there, I think they can say, well, you have the baseball game on the baseball field, and you have your rally at another location, and there is some of that that goes on in proposing different particular locales so as to accommodate all of the different users who want to use the park."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And is there a first come, first serve rule?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "Basically, yes. If you satisfy the other requirements of the rule, it's basically similar to this. It's subject to -- the actual first come, first served rule under the National Park Service parks here in Washington like this has to do with the date of the application, not the date on which it's processed. If there are no other, further questions, that concludes --"

    "speaker": "WILSON",
    "speech": "Justice O'Connor, I'd like to there's no meaningful administrative procedure. There is no mechanism. They send you a letter telling you that your permit was denied, and they read off the violations. You send a letter back and say, I did not do any of that, and they say, oh, yes, you did, denied. That's the end of it. There is no hearing. You don't even get to know who made the allegations. Secondly, in your inquiry as to judicial review, this Court unanimously provided us with a crystal clear definition of prompt judicial review. There should be no mystery in the Federal circuits. Another unanimous opinion, Blunt v. Rizzi, written by the same Justice who wrote Freedman, and on a Court that contains six of the justices who participated in Freedman, Blunt defined prompt judicial review as follows: A final judicial determination on the merits within a specified brief period. That was in 1971, so there should have been no mystery from the plurality of opinion in FW/PBS, because that plurality opinion did not say, there must be the availability of judicial review. That opinion said, there must be availability of prompt judicial review --"
