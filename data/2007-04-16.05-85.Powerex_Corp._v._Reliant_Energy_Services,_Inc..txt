1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:05 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation 5 versus Reliant Energy Services. 6 Mr. Frederick. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK, 8 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 9 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief 10 Justice, and may it please the Court. 11 In 1988, the Government of British Columbia 12 created Powerex to perform a variety of public functions 13 including the marketing of surplus hydropower generated 14 by development of the Province's natural resources 15 pursuant to bilateral agreements with the United States. 16 The Ninth Circuit, however, denied Powerex 17 its rightful status as an organ of a foreign State 18 entitled to remove this case from State court to Federal 19 court. 20 Before addressing the appellate jurisdiction 21 issue, I'd like to highlight briefly the two key errors 22 by the Ninth Circuit in rejecting Powerex's organ 23 status. First, the court articulated the wrong test for 24 determining an entity's status as an organ of a foreign 25 State. The factors the Ninth Circuit found dispositive

1 are inconsistent with the FSIA; and second, the court 2 overlooked crucial evidence of Powerex's public 3 functions that are the best indication of its sovereign 4 status. The British Columbia Government receives and 5 distributes the proceeds from Powerex's operations, 6 supervises Powerex through BC Hydro, subjects Powerex to 7 provincial laws not applicable to private companies and 8 grants Powerex special benefits including exemption from 9 taxation. 10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Frederick, are you 11 going to get to the 1447(d) problem? 12 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. Let me address that 13 now. The court's -- the district court's remand order 14 was appealable because it was not issued under 1447(c). 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The district court 16 thought it was and one we did, the district court said I 17 have no authority in -- under -- over any of these 18 people. So back it goes. 19 MR. FREDERICK: The district court made two 20 mutually exclusive statements, that remand was proper 21 and that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Because 22 of that inconsistency, the court of appeals -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Removal. Removal was24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- talking that -- where 25 are these statements?

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: You said remand was proper. 2 That's the -3 MR. FREDERICK: Sorry. That removal was 4 proper under the sovereign removal provisions of 1441(d) 5 and 1442(a). It also then said it lacked subject matter 6 jurisdiction. 7 JUSTICE SOUTER: But at the point it was 8 acting it was remanding, and its basis for remanding was 9 not that it thought the removal had been proper; the 10 basis for its remanding was that it said it lacked 11 jurisdiction over three of the other cross defendants. 12 MR. FREDERICK: But immunity was the basis 13 of the district court's thinking that it had to remand. 14 JUSTICE SOUTER: It may have been, leaving 15 aside the question of whether it was right or wrong, it 16 may have been wrong. But what it thought it was doing 17 it seems to me is fairly clearly remanding for a 18 jurisdictional reason. 19 MR. FREDERICK: And what this Court's cases 20 say, Justice Souter, is that the remand has to be a 21 ground cognizable under 1447(c). 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those cases are all 23 -- all based on Thermtron. You don't have any doubt 24 that Thermtron would come out the other way today, do 25 you?

1 MR. FREDERICK: I certainly do -2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in light of, in 3 light of the statutory language as it exists now? 4 MR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, the 5 Thermtron rule has been reaffirmed no less than four 6 times by this Court, notwithstanding two statutory 7 amendments. It has been reaffirmed and stare decisis on 8 the basis of statute is the strongest form of stare 9 decisis. So I do -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But stare decisis on 11 the basis of statute is kind of a weak basis when the 12 statute's been changed. 13 MR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, the 14 Thermtron rule was reaffirmed earlier this term in the 15 Osborn case, has been reaffirmed in prior cases lead -16 from the time it was decided even through statutory 17 amendments. Our submission is that if Congress intended 18 to change that rule, it could have done so clearly. And 19 we note that the Respondents here don't ask for 20 Thermtron to be overruled, and it is clear from the 21 amicus on their side, that the only way you could rule 22 in favor of the Respondents in this case would be to 23 overrule Thermtron. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Thermtron was such a 25 far cry from this case. In Thermtron the district judge

1 said yes, I have jurisdiction but I'm just too busy, so 2 I'm going to toss this case back to the State court. 3 MR. FREDERICK: But here, Justice Ginsburg, 4 the court did have jurisdiction because removal was 5 properly effectuated once the entities that we moved 6 were identified correctly as sovereigns, either foreign 7 sovereigns in the case of BC Hydro, or Federal 8 sovereigns in the case of BPA. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: But we go into that 10 question all the time, 1447(b) is a nullity. I mean, if 11 in every case you're going to be able to appeal whether 12 indeed there was lack of jurisdiction, you're going to 13 be able to appeal every case. 14 MR. FREDERICK: No, you're not, 15 Justice Scalia, and here's why. Immunity is not a 16 ground for remand because it is not a precondition for a 17 removal by a sovereign. It is a separate freestanding 18 issue. It is a status determination that determines 19 whether removal is proper by those sovereigns. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: That would be fine if 21 1447(d) said that there is no appeal so long as the 22 basis for removal was proper, but that's not what it 23 says. 24 MR. FREDERICK: But if in Thermtron the 25 court, the district court had said my docket is too

1 busy, I therefore lack subject matter jurisdiction and 2 remand under 1447(c), I don't think there's any doubt 3 that the courts would look beyond the label given. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't think the court 5 said in Thermtron, so therefore, I have no subject 6 matter jurisdiction. 7 MR. FREDERICK: I'm speaking hypothetically, 8 Justice Ginsburg. My point is that the label the 9 district court attached here was the wrong label, and 10 that's why the court of appeals to satisfy -11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? Why was it wrong 12 when with respect to the sovereign parties, the district 13 court said I have -- these people are totally immune 14 from suit; therefore, I have no jurisdiction over them. 15 MR. FREDERICK: Because it is inconsistent 16 with the notion that remand orders have no preclusive 17 effect to remand a case on the ground that the 18 sovereigns are immune, and force them to relitigate 19 their immune status in State court. That is precisely 20 why Congress enacted these sovereign removal provisions. 21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then what you are really 22 arguing for is, in effect, a separate rule, and that is 23 that 1447(d) has an exception when we are dealing with 24 foreign sovereign immunities. 25 MR. FREDERICK: That's our backup

1 submission, Justice Souter. You do not need to reach 2 that if you agree with our principal submission and -3 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the trouble with the 4 principal submission, it seems to me, is that we have 5 said that even if the district court has come to an 6 erroneous conclusion about jurisdiction, if it 7 understands that it is making a jurisdictional ruling, 8 that is not appealable. 9 MR. FREDERICK: But Justice Souter, it did 10 so. The case -- the cases in which the Court has said 11 so have always been grounds -- jurisdictional grounds 12 cognizable under 1447(c). Immunity from suit is not 13 such a ground, because the purpose of having the removal 14 provision on the basis of status is to allow the Federal 15 courts to decide the immunity status. If the court 16 sends the case back to State court on immunity grounds, 17 it does not have preclusive effect in the State courts. 18 The State courts will be obliged to relitigate sovereign 19 immunity status and there will be no recourse except 20 through appeal through the State court -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're into your 22 backup argument now. 23 MR. FREDERICK: No. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: The backup argument that 25 you're now making, that not your principal argument.

1 MR. FREDERICK: No, Justice Scalia, that's 2 not our backup argument. Our point is that in this 3 case, the district court had jurisdiction by virtue of 4 the successful removals, which everybody conceded were 5 correct, that the label that it attached, immunity is 6 subject matter jurisdiction, is not a label for a ground 7 recognized in 1447(c). So it was appropriate for the 8 court of appeals to exercise appellate jurisdiction to 9 determine whether or not the remand was a mandatory 10 remand under 1447(c) or a discretionary one of the type 11 this Court has recognized in the Cohill case. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you request -- when 13 the question of Powerex -- authority over Powerex was 14 before the district court, did you request that the 15 district court give you a 1292(b) order before the court 16 remanded the case, so that you could have gotten the 17 case -- the question up on appeal? 18 MR. FREDERICK: I don't believe that we did, 19 Justice Ginsburg. This case was remanded. A motion -20 motions for clarification were subsequently brought. 21 But a 1292(b) order was not requested by Powerex. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because that would have 23 taken care of it if the district judge agreed to delay 24 the remand to allow this question of law to be 25 determined by the court of appeals.

1 MR. FREDERICK: It is certainly the case 2 that in searching through the docket entries, you'll 3 discover that there was a holding by the district court 4 of the remand, which is in itself an unusual procedure. 5 But the point that is important here is that 6 even apart from that, when the court had jurisdiction 7 pursuant to the removal provisions, it did not lose 8 subject matter jurisdiction by finding the immunity 9 claims upon the part of the Federal and foreign 10 sovereigns. And it is their theory that the district 11 court never had subject matter jurisdiction, and that 12 has to be wrong because it conflicts with the purposes 13 behind the removal provision to give the sovereigns the 14 opportunity to litigate their immunity defenses in 15 Federal court. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: They don't care whether it 17 had subject matter jurisdiction or not. It's not an 18 essential part of their case. Their case is even if it 19 did, it mistakenly thought it didn't, and remand it, end 20 of case. 21 MR. FREDERICK: Their submission in this 22 Court, however, is that there was no subject matter 23 jurisdiction. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's their backup 25 argument, I think.

1 MR. FREDERICK: Well, their backup argument 2 should be rejected by the Court as wrong. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: If in fact it goes back to 4 the State court and you litigate it, you lost, can you 5 raise as a point of appeal that you did not receive two 6 things the statute guaranteed you? One was a 7 determination in the Federal court that you're an organ 8 of a Federal State, and second, a bench trial? 9 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Breyer, there's no 10 provision -11 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but could you? 12 MR. FREDERICK: By the time the appeals in 13 the State court would have been exhausted, the very 14 benefits -15 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm just asking could 16 you, yes or no. I -17 MR. FREDERICK: We would certainly make the 18 argument. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay. Now if you lost 20 in the State court, could you then use that as a basis 21 for asking this Court to accept jurisdiction? And if 22 they -- if we did, we took it and we heard the case, 23 reverse, and send it back for the proper tribal under 24 the statute? 25 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Breyer, I would not

And they're awful. 9 I don't deny them. I mean, they're right there in the 10 statute, it foresees them. So I wonder, is there any 11 difference in this case from every case where the remand 12 is erroneous? 13 MR. FREDERICK: I do think foreign 14 sovereigns are different, and Congress intended to treat 15 -16 JUSTICE BREYER: In terms of the legal right 17 to get the trial to which the law entitles you on your 18 view of the law, there is no difference. 19 MR. FREDERICK: The foreign sovereign is 20 entitled to a bench trial. It is entitled to other 21 procedural protections with respect to treatment of 22 garnishment, other -23 JUSTICE BREYER: And you would get those 24 eventually, it would just have to happen. 25 MR. FREDERICK: It would be after -- it

1 would be -2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's purely -3 pure question begging. I mean, the whole issue on the 4 merits is whether it's a foreign sovereign or not. And 5 you can't assume that you're correct when the remand 6 provision or the provision barring appeal when it's been 7 remanded doesn't care whether you're correct. The idea 8 is, you can get a correct determination in State court 9 through up to review by this Court eventually, as you 10 can in Federal court. There's no reason to assume that 11 the Federal court is the only place you would get a 12 correct determination. 13 MR. FREDERICK: But Mr. Chief Justice, the 14 point of having Congress enact these removal provisions 15 and to ensure jurisdiction in the federal court for 16 sovereigns on the basis of their status is entirely to 17 vindicate those rights and interests. If Powerex were 18 sued for not -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's the same with 20 diversity jurisdiction. You can make the same argument. 21 There's nothing distinctive here. This statute says 22 that in a foreign sovereign immunity case you have a 23 right to be tried in Federal court. Fine. But the 24 statute also says that if you're a defendant in a 25 diversity suit, you have a right to trial in federal
14

1 court. 2 And I don't know why this is any more 3 demanding of an exception to 1447(d) than is ordinary 4 diversity jurisdiction, where Congress has said you're 5 entitled to trial in federal court. 6 MR. FREDERICK: Diversity is different, 7 Justice Scalia, and here's why. 8 When a case is removed on diversity grounds, 9 the court of appeals -- the district court is obliged to 10 examine the bases of diversity. That is what the 11 court's removal duty is. When a foreign sovereign 12 removes a case, the district court's duty is to 13 determine is this a foreign State within the meaning of 14 the FSIA. If it is, I have jurisdiction. 15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, may I just 16 follow up on Justice Breyer's question? It seems to me 17 that your answer suggests that you have two bites at the 18 apple because you -- all the way along, you might win. 19 And if you won, then it wouldn't matter. If you lose, 20 you always have the argument that you've made here, 21 let's go back and start over again. 22 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Stevens, I don't 23 think we would win at all in that circumstance because 24 we would be forced as a foreign State to litigate in 25 State court contrary to Congress's will.

FREDERICK: It is certainly not 7 impossible, but the point -8 JUSTICE STEVENS: And if you lose, you 9 always have a point on appeal and may start all over 10 again later on. 11 MR. FREDERICK: It is unclear to me, and I'm 12 not sure that I've seen any of this Court's cases that 13 would suggest that the denial of that kind of procedural 14 right would be grounds for reversing a State court 15 judgment. And our position is that Congress intended to 16 protect the bench trial right, the immunity defenses of 17 a foreign sovereign, because the organ status 18 questioned -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did anybody in this 20 case -- did any of the Defendants in this case request a 21 trial by jury? 22 MR. FREDERICK: I don't recall whether the 23 Defendants do, but it is clear that the Plaintiffs would 24 be entitled to a jury trial -25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And have they asked for

1 it? Has any party asked for a jury trial? If not, that 2 part of the case seems academic. 3 MR. FREDERICK: Well, the case has settled, 4 Justice Ginsburg, prior to the formal invocation of 5 trial procedures, and so -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The case is settled? 7 MR. FREDERICK: As explained in the cert 8 petition papers, the case is on appeal in the State 9 court system on objections to the settlement, and it 10 will not be mooted during the course of this Court's 11 action on the case. 12 But the invocation of jury that would be 13 done normally just before trial has not been an issue 14 that's been presented. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's different 16 than it is in the Federal courts. You have to -- can't 17 wait to the eve of trial to demand a jury. 18 MR. FREDERICK: Well, what the Plaintiffs 19 here assert is that they would be denied their right to 20 jury trial, and I presume that that means they intend to 21 ask for one and to perpetuate that request. Our 22 position, as we explain in a footnote in our reply 23 brief, is that they have a jury trial right as against 24 Duke and Reliant; they do not as against the foreign 25 sovereigns that they have sued.

1 So at root, the case is about the kind of 2 comity and dignity that the courts of the United States 3 will accord to foreign sovereigns. If Powerex were sued 4 on the basis of non-commercial acts, it would not be 5 entitled to have its immunity defense vindicated if the 6 district court is held to have no jurisdiction, 7 notwithstanding the proper removal under 1441(d). 8 I'd like to save the reminder of my time for 9 rebuttal, please. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 11 Mr. Frederick. 12 Mr. Hallward-Driemeier. 13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER 14 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES 15 AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 16 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice, 17 and may it please the Court: 18 This Court has recognized repeatedly that 19 the bar on appellate review in 1447(d) applies only to 20 remands under 1447(c). This Court has held that the 21 courts of appeals have authority to decide whether a 22 remand order was, in fact, one within the authority of 23 1447(c). In fact, just this term in Osborn, the 24 district court remanded the case on the basis of 1447(c) 25 for purported lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
18

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Osborn made it very clear 2 that was an extraordinary case where Congress had 3 explicitly ordered two conflicting things. One, it said 4 no remand of a case of this type, and then it said no 5 review of remands. So the Court was as clear as it 6 could be that only when you have those conflicting 7 signals does that court -- does that case have any 8 application. 9 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Your Honor is 10 absolutely correct. Osborn concerned a particular kind 11 of categorical exception from 1447(c). Our argument is 12 that as a categorical matter, the basis of remand in 13 this case was not one within the scope of 1447(c). That 14 although the District Court termed the sovereign 15 immunity of the defendant's jurisdictional, it was not 16 jurisdictional in the relevant sense. And this Court 17 held precisely that in the Oliver American trading case. 18 There, a case removed by Mexico was dismissed by the 19 district court on the basis of its immunity and the 20 district court certified that holding as a 21 jurisdictional decision immediately appealable to this 22 Court. 23 Yet this Court looked beyond that label 24 attached by the district court and held that sovereign 25 immunity is not jurisdictional in the relevant sense
19

1 because it does not limit the authority of the Federal 2 courts qua Federal courts but rather is a general rule 3 that would preclude suit in State court as well. 4 Likewise, under 1447(c) it is not a basis to remand that 5 the defendant is immune. 6 When Congress authorized sovereign 7 defendants to remove cases to Federal court to vindicate 8 their immunity, it did not intend that when the district 9 court upheld that immunity, it would be remanded to 10 State court which would be free to disregard the Federal 11 court's decision. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: One technical question. 13 The same one. I would to be -- imagine it is a 14 diversity case. Imagine that a Federal court 15 erroneously remands it. A trial gets up to this Court. 16 And we say it was diverse. It shouldn't have been 17 remanded. Now what's -- is that like -- can that 18 happen? I guess. And is the remedy then wipe out the 19 State proceedings, go back to Federal court? What 20 happens? Has that have ever been a case like that? 21 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: What happened? 23 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The Missouri 24 Pacific Railway case holds that even this Court, on 25 review of a State court judgment following remand cannot

1 review the remand order itself. It can review issues of 2 Federal law that were decided by the State courts on 3 remand but -4 JUSTICE BREYER: And it is called, the case, 5 Missouri -6 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Missouri Pacific 7 Railway case. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what -9 what do you do about 1447(e) which says that if after 10 removal joinder might defeat subject matter 11 jurisdiction, the court can deny joinder or permit 12 joinder and remand the action. In other words, you have 13 got subject matter jurisdiction but the statute 14 contemplates it may -- later -- later you may lose 15 subject matter jurisdiction and you can remand it there. 16 And I suppose that that needs to be interpreted in pari 17 materia with (c) so that the remands would not be 18 subject to review. It seems to me the same situation 19 here. You have got allegedly subject matter 20 jurisdiction. It is later defeated, and it is remanded. 21 Why shouldn't that be covered by (c)? 22 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: What, what's 23 notable is that Congress enacted 1447(e) at the same 24 time that it amended 1447(c). It provided in 1447(e) 25 for an authority to remand in a particular instance
21

1 where the court lost subject matter jurisdiction 2 post-removal. It had of course been the rule since this 3 Court's decision in St. Paul Mercury Indemnity, that 4 post-removal events did not defeat the removal court's 5 jurisdiction; and in the statute it was made explicit 6 that 1447(c) authorized remand only when the case was 7 removed improvidently and without jurisdiction. 8 And when Congress amended the language in 9 1998 to make clear that non-jurisdictional defects in 10 removal had to be raised immediately or were forfeited, 11 it at the same time -- and added the language, or 12 changed the language in the second sentence that raises 13 problems for our argument; at the same time, it added 14 1447(e) to provide, as I said, a particular authority to 15 remand based on post-removal events that would have been 16 unnecessary if, as Respondents urge, 1447(c) was 17 intended to confer general authority to remand on the 18 basis of post-removal events. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't have 20 any doubt that a remand under 1447(e) would be covered 21 by 1447(d), do you? 22 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No. And the courts 23 of appeals that have considered that question likewise 24 hold that a remand under 1447(e) is right in pari 25 materia with (d) although the courts seem to be split on
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 whether the decision to allow the joinder is a separable 2 decision appealable under Waco or not. But -- but that 3 issue is not presented. 4 But what is significant is that had Congress 5 intended by the amendment of 1447(c) to authorize for 6 the first time remand on the basis of post-removal 7 events, 1447(e) would have been unnecessary; and yet, 8 the legislative history, the 1447(e), makes clear that 9 Congress believed that in the absence of that provision, 10 the Court would have been limited to two alternatives. 11 Authorize the joinder -- or deny the joinder, or dismiss 12 the case. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: How is that relevant here? 14 Where is the post-removal event? 15 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The post-removal 16 event here is the recognition of the defendant's 17 sovereign immunity. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's not an event. 19 That's -- that's an epiphany, it's not an event. 20 (Laughter.) 21 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, according -22 well, apparently the district court viewed it as a 23 post-removal event that deprived it, or defeated, 24 divested -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Very strange meaning of

1 event. 2 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I -- Your 3 Honor -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean the sovereign 5 immunity didn't exist from the outset. Nothing changed. 6 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But -- but the 7 district court's order is clear. And it is absolutely 8 correct in this regard that removal jurisdiction existed 9 at the outset. So the court does not lack removal 10 jurisdiction. The reference in 1447(c), second sentence 11 to "lacks subject matter jurisdiction," refers to lacks 12 removal jurisdiction. And in fact, this Court used that 13 shorthand repeatedly in the Kircher decision to describe 14 1447(c), lacks removal jurisdiction. This Court -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: When did it say that? I 16 really find it very hard to accept that argument, when 17 its says -- you know -- it doesn't use lacks removal 18 jurisdiction, that's what it means. It is such an easy 19 thing to say. 20 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the Court has 21 to go back to the history of the statute, how it's 22 evolved. Clearly pre-1998, authority to remand was only 23 if it was removed without jurisdiction. And so the 24 question is when Congress changed the language to lacks 25 subject matter jurisdiction, did it mean lacks removal

1 jurisdiction? Which it -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Under the -- under the 3 district court's view, would there have been original 4 jurisdiction against Powerex? 5 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No, it would not 6 have. Bit that's because of the peculiarities of the 7 difference between original jurisdiction under the FSIA, 8 section 1330(a), and removal jurisdiction under the 9 FSIA. Whereas original jurisdiction depends upon a 10 conclusion that the defendant is not immune, Congress 11 conferred removal jurisdiction whenever a foreign 12 sovereign is defended. 13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then can you -14 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Likewise in 15 1442(a), which was about the Federal -16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can, can you tell me, if 17 the Petitioner does not prevail here, the case goes back 18 to the State court. Can the immunity argument be raised 19 in the State court? 20 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The immunity 21 argument could be raised in State court. That's what 22 this Court held in Kircher. But the defendant would be 23 forever denied its right to a bench trial under Federal 24 law. That right is limited to suits in the Federal 25 courts by its term; 1441(d) --

HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The State court 10 could reconsider Powerex's status as a foreign 11 sovereign, but it wouldn't have many, if any, 12 implications in the State court because Powerex isn't 13 claiming immunity in this case. It's only invoking the 14 procedural benefits of the FSIA which include that the 15 case be litigated in the Federal court before a judge 16 rather than a jury. And it would be forever denied the 17 benefits, those important procedural benefits of the 18 statute if this Court doesn't uphold review of the -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we don't know -20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, the -- the 21 Federal determination bars the State court from 22 redetermining that there's immunity?

Thanks, 5 Your Honor. 6 The Court: Thank you, Counsel. 7 Mr. Simon. 8 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD B. SIMON, 9 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS 10 MR. SIMON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 11 please the Court. 12 There are two reasons, independent and 13 sufficient reasons why there is in appellate 14 jurisdiction in this case. The first most narrow and 15 simple reason to vacate the decision below for lack of 16 jurisdiction, is to follow this Court's precedents which 17 accept the district court's remand order for what it is 18 and what it says it is, a remand for lack of subject 19 matter jurisdiction under 1447(c), unremovable under 20 1447(d). That is a simple direct route to that result. 21 There is a second approach suggested by a 22 lot of the briefing and some of the argument Your Honors 23 have heard this morning. And I want to lay it out 24 briefly for the Court. 25 And it is that, as the law professor amici
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 have suggested, there is some amount of confusion in the 2 lower courts, I might say with due respect, evasion of 3 1447(d) in the lower courts, by judge-made exceptions to 4 1447(d), created by some but not all of the courts of 5 appeal. 6 And the Court could clear out some of this 7 underbrush, mooting many of the issues that 8 Mr. Frederick and the that Solicitor General have 9 raised. Thermtron after Carnegie Mellon, addressing the 10 question Justice Kennedy raised in his concurring 11 opinion, in Things Remembered versus Petrarca, Thermtron 12 does not say what many of the lower courts think it 13 does. Thermtron does not say what my adversaries say it 14 does, because Thermtron has been partially overruled by 15 Carnegie Mellon. The notion that the only proper remand 16 is a 1447(c) remand is ancient history after Carnegie 17 Mellon, and therefore the notion that the only remand 18 covered by 1447(d) is a remand under 1447(c) is also 19 ancient history. 20 Congress has given us a simple and strong 21 message, which is when we're disputing the forum, when 22 the parties in a case are legitimately and in good faith 23 disputing forum, State court versus Federal court, 24 Congress has said take one shot at it, let an Article 25 III judge determine whether the forum is State court or

They would like 6 to sue China. They would like to sue Russia. There are 7 all kinds of places they would like to sue. And why 8 would Congress want to have a system that says to those 9 countries, you can come into Federal court and get your 10 claim adjudicated, whether it is really you, China a; 11 but by the way, if the Federal judge makes a mistake, 12 there you are in Mississippi, Alabama, Illinois, any one 13 of 50 different states? In front of juries, the very 14 thing that we gave you this statute so you wouldn't have 15 to do. 16 Now what would their theory be? 17 MR. SIMON: It -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I, -- I'm not sure it 19 is even that he made a mistake. It is even worse than 20 that. If he gets it right and finds that you are a 21 sovereign -22 MR.

1 questions. The problem is whether he gets it right or 2 wrong, we spend two years in a court of appeals. But 3 Your Honor, you're assuming there's an immunity issue in 4 this case. With due respect, my adversaries are arguing 5 someone else's case. There is no immunity claim in this 6 case by Powerex. There is one petition, one petitioner. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: They were saying they were 8 an organ of -9 MR. SIMON: They were saying they were an 10 organ. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, and therefore they 12 are immune unless -- unless they fall within an 13 exception. And it may be they do. 14 Is that not right? 15 MR. SIMON: No. They conceded that they 16 fell within the exception. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm saying, that's 18 how the statute works. 19 MR. SIMON: Right. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: But I take it if you win 21 this, it's precisely the same, in respect to a person 22 who has total immunity. 23 MR. SIMON: No. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? 25 MR. SIMON: I would disagree Your Honor.

It would have argued 10 number one, we are a foreign sovereign; maybe it wins, 11 maybe it loses. And number two. We are immune. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 13 MR. SIMON: There is a solid line of cases 14 that suggests the decision on immunity -- first of all 15 let me say, I think it is somewhat far-fetched that a 16 party that would actually be immune, say the King of 17 Saudi Arabia, would end up being in this third lowest 18 category of foreign -- purported foreign sovereigns and 19 end up in the position Powerex is in. 20 But if it did, in other words we have three 21 categories. We have immunes, we have non-immunes who 22 got Federal court, and then we have would-be foreign 23 sovereigns like Powerex, who end up in State court. And 24 I'm suggesting for a party to fall from the first 25 category to the third in front of an Article III

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. SIMON: The difference is that the 2 immunity issue is reviewed on appeal because there is a 3 line of court of appeal cases -- a majority, not a 4 unanimous majority, never blessed by this Court -- which 5 suggests that immunity is so important, don't need a 6 lawyer, you don't go to court, you don't say a word, you 7 don't spend a dollar, you walk away -- so important that 8 you are entitled to an immediate -9 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, and you agree with 10 that? 11 MR. SIMON: And I agree with that. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Then why is it in 13 your opinion that the immunity thing is so important 14 that they get this collateral appeal, but the organ 15 thing is not so important since all, what turns on that 16 is whether they're going to have their non-jury trial. 17 MR. SIMON: Well, I want to come back 18 non-jury trial and answer Justice Ginsburg's question 19 because I don't think she got the right answer. But the 20 reason it's more important is this is, as Justice Scalia 21 said, like a diversity decision, this is a litigation 22 who sells power in the Pacific Northwest and admits that 23 it competes with Enron, Duke, and Reliance, and it is 24 disputing whether it belongs in a State court in San 25 Diego or the Federal court across the street in San
33

1 Diego, leaving aside the jury issue. And that is 2 precisely the kind of dispute that Congress suggested in 3 1447(d) and its predecessors, which have been on the 4 books for more than 100 years, ought to be done once. 5 What do they say, one and done? Is that what they say 6 in the district court? 7 JUSTICE ALITO: You're saying this all turns 8 on our assessment of the strength of the interest in 9 remaining in Federal court? Is that what it boils down 10 to? 11 MR. SIMON: No, it turns on the strength of 12 getting an immediate decision on the immunity question. 13 The immunity question I think is a question of an 14 entirely different nature than the question of forum. 15 In the -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The immunity question, 17 the immunity question is the same as State or Federal 18 court, because the statute as it's written, any foreign 19 sovereign, China, whatever, is as immune from State 20 court jurisdiction as it is from Federal court 21 jurisdiction because Congress said so. 22 But with respect to the commercial 23 enterprise, Congress said, we're going to give you a 24 Federal court and we're going to give you a judge trial. 25 That doesn't apply to State courts.

1 MR. SIMON: That's correct. But Congress 2 said, we're going to give you a Federal forum and a 3 bench tribal if you convince us that you are an agency 4 or instrumentality of a foreign State. This, this 5 corporation Powerex failed to make that convincing 6 showing. Having failed to make that convincing slowing, 7 again, they are debating in the appellate courts and 8 tying litigants up for two, five years over whether this 9 case should be litigated in State court or in Federal 10 court. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a sovereign 12 party who said: I'm out of this; I have suit immunity. 13 And that was the B.C. -14 MR. SIMON: B.C. Hydro. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What happened to B.C. 16 Hydro? Because as I understand the district court sent 17 that party back, too. 18 MR. SIMON: The district court found that 19 they were immune, properly followed the law, but 20 determined because it believed it had no subject matter 21 jurisdiction that it should then stop at that point, 22 that it should just walk away from the case and remand 23 it, over the vehement disagreement of B.C. Hydro and the 24 parallel vehement disagreement of the Bonneville Power 25 Administration. The Ninth Circuit when it erroneously

1 took the appeal on the remand also clarified or 2 straightened out that issue. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but it couldn't -4 if you are right, then the Ninth Circuit never should 5 have touched this case. So what happens to the three 6 parties, two U.S. parties, one British Columbia, who are 7 entitled to suit immunity? 8 MR. SIMON: Well, what's happened so far is 9 nothing, which might tell us that in the practical world 10 when a Federal district judge says that B.C. Hydro is 11 immune and then remands a multi-plaintiff, 12 multi-defendant, multi-cross defendant-cross defendant 13 case to San Diego Superior Court, it is exceedingly that 14 the San Diego Superior Court will reconsider the 15 immunity. But if it did -16 JUSTICE ALITO: But could it? 17 MR. SIMON: I suppose it could, but if it 18 did that matter is subject to appeal and subject to 19 ultimate certiorari review in this Court. So I think 20 we're talking about a frolic. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: I thought the argument you 22 were making a few minutes ago, if I understood it 23 correctly, was that B.C. Hydro would not have been 24 barred by 1447(d) from taking an appeal to contest the 25 remand; is that correct or not.

1 MR. SIMON: I think B.C. Hydro could have 2 taken a collateral order, a collateral order appeal. 3 JUSTICE ALITO: Whether it's a collateral 4 order or not just goes to whether it falls under 1291. 5 It doesn't speak at all to the issue of 1447. 6 MR. SIMON: B.C. Hydro could have attempted 7 to appeal the immunity decision under a series of 8 decisions which suggest that immunity is so important 9 that it ought to be decided right then. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: The difference between that 11 immunity and Powerex's status is what? It's simply the 12 fact that there's a stronger interest in allowing 13 immediate appellate review, Federal appellate review of 14 the determination of the remand of a party that claims 15 to be a sovereign as opposed to Powerex's status as an 16 organ? 17 MR. SIMON: Among several other things. 18 There is a stronger interest in that, and we are not 19 debating about the forum. Again, we have the Kircher 20 case from last term saying State courts are perfectly 21 capable of resolving this issue. That is a quotation 22 actually from the Missouri Pacific case. 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we think that Powerex, 24 that there's a strong interest in having Powerex remain 25 in Federal court if it's entitled To that under the
37

1 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, that would be suffer 2 to get around 1447(d)? 3 MR. SIMON: I think Justice Scalia was 4 correct to say there is just as strong an interest in a 5 diversity case in having a New York corporation trying 6 to escape -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm having, I'm having 8 the same problem as Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer. 9 Can you say in just a few sentences the difference 10 between the case where there is sovereign immunity, 11 China, the China hypothetical, and this case where it's 12 organ immunity? 13 MR. SIMON: Yes, if I could -14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're telling us that one 15 is more important than the other, but there's no textual 16 basis in the statute for us to make that distinction. 17 MR. SIMON: I think there are two 18 differences, so if I could. One is textual and one is 19 important. Let me start with the textual difference. 20 The textual difference is that 1447(d) speaks to 21 remands, and so to the extent the district court 22 remanded the matter to State court the remand is 23 untouchable on appeal or by mandamus because of 1447(d). 24 And if the foreign -- if the foreign relations body, 25 lobby, doesn't like that, if the State Department
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 doesn't like, that they can go to the Capitol and get 2 that fixed quite easily. 3 There are half a dozen exceptions to 1447(d) 4 for class actions, for Native Americans, for civil 5 rights cases, and they can get their own exceptions. So 6 to the extent what the trial court did was remand, it is 7 untouchable. That is my textual answer. It's a remand, 8 i.e. Waco, in which the court says the remand is 9 untouchable, the dismissal of the unnecessary or 10 indispensable party is reviewable. So what I would say 11 is, although the remand is untouchable, the denial of 12 immunity -- and that's why I kept saying collateral 13 order; I apologize if that confused you, Justice Alito. 14 I meant that line of cases about going 15 straight up even though the case was continuing. While 16 the case continues in State court, where it belongs 17 under 1447(d), it would appear under this line of 18 collateral order cases that the denial of immunity 19 per se could go up on its own -20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking why is denial 21 of immunity for sovereign status different from denial 22 of organ status giving you a right to a bench trial, 23 etcetera? 24 MR. SIMON: Possibly, possibly this could 25 would decide that question the other way. But --

1 JUSTICE BREYER: We have this very old judge 2 like me. China is there. And he says: This isn't 3 China; Formosa is China. So he says remand. So there 4 we are, China is now in the Western District State Court 5 for Illinois and they're suing them for a lot of money. 6 Now, you said, I thought, before that where that 7 happened, and they wrongly ly denied immunity, they 8 could, China, appeal in the Federal system. I thought 9 you said that. 10 MR. SIMON: Yes. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 12 MR. SIMON: But not the remand. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: What? 14 MR. SIMON: But not the remand. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: All they want is a 16 definitive appeal that this is really China, all right. 17 Now, can they do that, yes or no? You said yes. 18 So I thought Justice Kennedy's question was, 19 if they can do that, why can't Powerex appeal in exactly 20 the same way on the question of whether they're an 21 organ. What's the difference? 22 MR. SIMON: The first difference is what I 23 said in response to Your Honor's question was I think 24 they could do that under some cases from the courts of 25 appeal. I know they can't appeal the remand because we

1 have an act of Congress which -2 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't care. I don't call 3 this an appeal of a remand. What this is, it is an 4 Appeal of the determination precedent to remand that 5 Powerex is not an organ. 6 MR. SIMON: Well, Justice Breyer -7 JUSTICE BREYER: That would make them just 8 as happy, I believe. 9 MR. SIMON: Justice Breyer, think about a 10 multi-party case and maybe my answer will be clearer to 11 you. In a multi-party case my position is the remand 12 stands, the case goes back to Missouri or Mississippi or 13 wherever your hypothetical was, but at the same time, I 14 do believe that the potentially immune party, which is 15 not here in this courtroom today, the potentially immune 16 party, could seek to review of what is a dispositive 17 ruling. 18 Remember, that's a dispositive ruling. They 19 win the case. That's very different than a venue 20 ruling. 21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Regardless of how they 22 would get up on it, assuming they could get up on the 23 immunity question, our series of questions is why do we 24 draw or why should we draw a distinction between 25 immunity and federal bench trial? And your answer is, I
41

1 take it, immunity is dispositive; Federal bench tribal 2 is not? 3 MR. SIMON: Immunity is dispositive and 4 Federal bench trial is not -- and is no different from 5 the day to day decisions district courts make all the 6 time about the choice between a State court and a 7 Federal court in the area of remands and removals. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Immunity, suit immunity, 9 is you can't be sued anyplace, not in State court, not 10 in Federal court; you can't be sued, period. But now it 11 is admitted that you can be sued. That's not in dispute 12 in this case, right? 13 MR. SIMON: That's correct. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the only question is 15 where. 16 MR.

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: I just want to be sure 2 your position. Assume that there is a remand that was 3 improper and cannot be appealed under your theory and 4 the Powerex argues all along, I was entitled to a 5 Federal forum and a non-jury trial. And the State court 6 says no all the way up. Can they file a petition for 7 certiorari saying, we had a Federal right that was 8 denied us, not the remand but our entitlement to a bench 9 trial? Can they petition for certiorari at the end of 10 the State proceeding in your view. 11 MR. SIMON: Other than the jury question, I 12 think the answer would be no because of 1447(d), because 13 I think 1447(e) would suggest that that's an appeal of a 14 remand. But again, you're asking questions that I 15 believe have not been addressed by this Court or even 16 lower courts. 17 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just wondering what 18 your position is. 19 MR. SIMON: A clever enough lawyer I suppose 20 could argue that at that point that we're no longer 21 challenging the remand, the remand has happened and been 22 completed and the trial has taken place; we're now 23 simply challenging the results. And maybe that clever 24 lawyer would win the day. 25 JUSTICE SOUTER: And in effect he would say
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 -- I mean, I assume what the clever lawyer would say is, 2 State court, cannot try me at all. The feds can do what 3 they want about remand and it gets back here. But 4 because I'm entitled to a bench trial, you cannot try me 5 at all. Isn't that the argument? 6 MR. SIMON: Oh, I think in State court a 7 clever litigant could argue all these points over again, 8 because 1447(e) -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: But his clever opponent 10 would say -11 (Laughter.) 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that what 1447(d) means 13 is that you can be tried in State courts. That's 14 precisely what it says. 15 JUSTICE SOUTER: And ultimately when the two 16 clever parties got to the State supreme court, they 17 would have these two opposing issues and ultimately if 18 we granted cert this Court would decide it, wouldn't it. 19 MR. SIMON: This Court would ultimately 20 decide it and they would ultimately decide questions 21 such as whether the jury or, to put it the other, the 22 bench trial issue has been preserved. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not say, depending on 24 the clever lawyers, or non-clever as the case may be, 25 why not just say Congress intended that you do get an
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 underlying appeal in the Federal system, for what is at 2 stake is not simply where the case will be tried, but 3 rather significant and important rights attach in the 4 Federal court that do not attach in the State court. 5 And therefore, it is right, the appeal you get when 6 they -- when what is at stake is immune or not, and by 7 doing that we avoid four more years of litigation and 8 the necessity to hire clever lawyers. 9 MR. SIMON: Well, Congress has said -10 Congress has said the contrary. And there are often 11 important differences between State and Federal courts. 12 Justice Breyer, I think you have some experience in 13 California. We have 9 to 3 jury verdicts. You will 14 have a litigant here next year saying that the 15 difference between a removal and a remand is a unanimous 16 jury verdict or a 9 to 3 jury verdict, and that's really 17 important. 18 Now, I would just briefly like to go back to 19 Justice Ginsburg's question about a jury because I don't 20 think she got the full answer. Let me give it to you, 21 Justice Ginsburg. The jury issue is virtually -- I 22 would say not virtually. The jury issue is out of this 23 case based on my adversary's reply brief. I will tell 24 why you. We did ask for a jury trial in our case and we 25 were upset about the whole notion of this case being
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 removed on a cross-claim we were not involved in -- we 2 never sued Powerex -- losing our right to a jury trial 3 on this important case. 4 Mr. Frederick's reply brief says at footnote 5 4, page 3 -- or footnote 3, page 4; I apologize -- that 6 our right to jury trial is not threatened here and that 7 under certain lower court decisions, which he is correct 8 they do exist -- I'm not sure they're unanimous -- Our 9 right to jury trial would survive even though he would 10 have a right to a bench trial under his theory. 11 Well, there is no right to a jury trial on 12 the cross claim against Mr. Frederick's client. The 13 cross claim in the California court, which got this 14 whole ball of wax rolling, is a cross claim for 15 equitable indemnification and declaratory relief, 16 equitable claims as to which there is no right to a jury 17 trial. So I think we are all now in agreement on a jury 18 trial. We are arguing someone else's case. Some day a 19 litigant will appear in this Court and present the issue 20 of jury trial -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they raise that there 22 is still the question of Federal forum over State forum. 23 MR. SIMON: There is, and that's the issue 24 that I think Congress has clearly and definitively said, 25 the State courts have pretty good judges, pretty good
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 juries, pretty good systems and certiorari procedures to 2 this Court. In Kircher, the Court's opinion says, "the 3 State courts are perfectly competent to resolve these 4 issues." 5 The cost of this case being frozen for 3 or 6 4 years while we debated these issues -- and these 7 issues are very difficult. I would say, we don't only 8 have a backup position, we have a backup backup 9 position. Because we think, number one, the court 10 should be taken at its word. We think, number two, the 11 court had no subject matter jurisdiction. Removing 12 jurisdiction is not subject matter jurisdiction. If you 13 look at the book, Chapter 89, Section 1441, et cetera, 14 it's titled Removal of Cases From State Courts. You 15 won't find the word "subject matter jurisdiction" in 16 there anywhere. 17 A removal petition removes a case from the 18 State court to the Federal court, where if it's a 19 foreign sovereign immunities case, the Federal court 20 decides if it has subject matter jurisdiction. That's 21 what 1330 says in haec verba. It's what this Court's 22 decision in Verlinden versus Central Bank of Nigeria 23 says in haec verba. Verlinden says every court that 24 gets a foreign sovereign immunities case must determine 25 at the outset whether it has subject matter jurisdiction

1 by determining if the foreign sovereign is immune. 2 Which means that Judge Whaley was correct 3 when he decided that by concluding he had an immune 4 party in front of him, he had no jurisdiction. And it 5 was equally correct for Bonneville, when he determined 6 that United States versus Myers says the same thing, so 7 that he had no subject matter jurisdiction. And in 8 addition, there was a derivative jurisdiction doctrine. 9 This notion of "removal jurisdiction" quote 10 unquote, it's a term we all use. The Court used it in 11 Kircher. I use it. Other people use it. But if you 12 start getting serious about your words, it's meaningless 13 in this context. We have subject matter jurisdiction 14 and it is conferred in the area of 1330, 1331, 1332. It 15 is not conferred in 1441, 1442, or 1443. It's simply 16 not there. 17 So my backup argument is, he was right on 18 every point. And my backup argument beyond that is 19 again, please, reread Carnegie Mellon. Put it next to 20 Thermtron and look at what the lower courts have done. 21 They have found excuse after excuse to take appeals in 22 cases that have no business being in the courts of 23 appeals. They don't have immunity issues. They don't 24 have foreign sovereign issues. They don't have 25 anything.

1 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the reason why they 2 may have done that is because they've seen case after 3 case where absolute power corrupts absolutely. And 4 because district judges know that remand orders are not 5 reviewable, on occasion they will remand cases for 6 reasons that are clearly improper. That may be the 7 reason. 8 Now on your first argument, you say that 9 what the district judge says is dispositive. You mean 10 if the district judge says I lack subject matter 11 jurisdiction because my docket is crowded, that's not -12 MR. SIMON: No. 13 JUSTICE ALITO: That's not -14 MR. SIMON: No, Your Honor. I overstated. 15 Let me say it more clearly. Kircher, decided last term, 16 makes clear the line between what can and can't be done. 17 It discusses precisely this point and it refers to the 18 Ryan versus Contra case and it refers to the Principi 19 case. And it says that when the court is patently wrong 20 about whether the issue it is discussing is subject 21 matter jurisdiction, then this Court may enter into -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, it's a good 23 thing you've got a lot of fallback arguments because you 24 fall back very quickly. I would have thought your 25 answer to Justice Alito would be, the statute says if
49

1 it's remanded, it's not reviewable on appeal or 2 otherwise. And if it's remanded for a silly reason, 3 that will be corrected on review of the State supreme 4 court by this Court. 5 MR. SIMON: That would be my first answer, 6 and the Chief Justice said it much better than mine, 7 than I have. But I think, Your Honor, looking at 8 Kircher, to be fair, looking at Kircher, I believe that 9 is the position Justice Scalia took, it is concurring 10 opinion. And I didn't want to suggest that 11 Justice Scalia's concurring opinion was the opinion of 12 the Court. The opinion of the Court wrestles with what 13 I thought was Justice Alito's question. What do you do 14 if the trial judge says he has no subject matter 15 jurisdiction and he has not simply made a garden variety 16 jurisdictional error but he has missed what the issue 17 is? It's really failure to state a claim. It's really 18 something else. And we of course have the Steele case 19 which says jurisdiction has many meanings and we often 20 get confused about them. And the Court answered the 21 question by saying, only when the trial court is 22 patently wrong, patently wrong not about the 23 jurisdictional question but as to whether it is even a 24 jurisdictional question, only when the court is patently 25 wrong do we second guess the court.

1 So -2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That certainly 3 changes the argument. So the notice of appeal that's 4 filed or the brief on appeal says not only was the court 5 wrong, it was patently wrong, and the court of appeals 6 has to consider that before determining whether it has 7 jurisdiction to review the remand order. 8 MR. SIMON: If the court wants to adopt 9 Justice Scalia's view in the prior case, in the Kircher 10 case, my clients would be pleased with the results -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: I recommend that. 12 (Laughter.) 13 MR. SIMON: But I think, Justice Roberts -14 I think, Mr. Chief Justice -- I apologize. Because my 15 time is running short, I would say the key point in this 16 case came when we sought to have a prompt dismissal in 17 the Ninth Circuit of the appeal prior to full briefing 18 and argument, and it was denied. That was the point at 19 which if a litigant simply parroted the phrase "this is 20 patently wrong," would likely in most circuits before 21 most panels have lost. And this matter would have gone 22 back to the State court 2-1/2 years before it got 23 affirmed by the Ninth Circuit and five years before 24 today. 25 Unless the Court has any further questions,

1 I think I've completed my comments. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 3 Mr. Simon. 4 Mr. Frederick, you have three minutes 5 remaining. 6 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, a 9 non-jury trial is an aspect of sovereign immunity. This 10 Court's cases have recognized that. In footnote 6 of 11 the Government's brief, the Government cites the Lehman 12 case which makes this point clear and argues that the 13 point should be applicable to sovereigns in the context 14 in which we are faced here. 15 The question of whether a foreign entity, 16 and it's more complicated often in the real world, 17 Justice Breyer, as your question's identified not simply 18 with questions but with the kinds of entities that 19 foreign governments create to advance public purposes. 20 The intent of Congress was not to have those kinds of 21 entities tested in State court to determine whether or 22 not they enjoyed the privileges and procedural 23 protections of the FSIA. And it is not simply a 24 question of whether or not an elderly judge might choose 25 to recognize China or Formosa, but rather the kinds of
52

1 instrumentalities that were created by those governments 2 to advance public purposes, to serve as separate 3 political entities, and who would be performing the 4 kinds of acts that might lead them into litigation, and 5 -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And Congress said, those 7 entities don't get any immunity, they get two things: 8 They get a federal forum and they get a judge trial. 9 That's all that's at stake. 10 MR. FREDERICK: That's not all that's at 11 stake, Justice Ginsburg. There are also rights with 12 respect to foreign states to be free of punitive 13 damages. There are rights to have certain property of 14 the sovereign that would be subject to different 15 attachment rules. 16 The FSIA has a whole string of procedural 17 protections that are afforded to foreign states and 18 their instrumentalities. And this case ultimately is 19 about the fact that Powerex is being subjected to 20 multiple suits in State court, but as a result of the 21 Ninth Circuit's holding in -22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are those -- have they 23 been sued by the plaintiffs in any of these cases or 24 have they always been brought in by defendants? 25 MR. FREDERICK: They have been directly sued
53

1 by the People of the State of California whom my brother 2 here represents. They have been sued by the California 3 Attorney General. They have been sued by the California 4 Department of Water Resources. And under the Ninth 5 Circuit's precedent in this case which I urge you to 6 overturn, Powerex has been remanded to State court, has 7 not been permitted to appeal the remand order, and is 8 stuck in State court in these cases without any 9 opportunity to test what is a clearly erroneous, and 10 what my brother doesn't make any attempt to defend, the 11 merits of the decision, that Powerex has performed 12 public functions, it's serving at the direction of the 13 Government of British Columbia, and is performing these 14 functions to advance clearly public purposes. 15 And yet, we are now in this Kafkaesque work 16 world between State and Federal court where if we try to 17 litigate all the way up through State court, it is not 18 entirely clear whether we will ever have our organ -19 our status as a foreign organ ever vindicated. Thank 20 you. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 22 The case is submitted. 23 (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the 24 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 25
