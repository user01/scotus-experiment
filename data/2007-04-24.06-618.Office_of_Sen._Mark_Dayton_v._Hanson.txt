1 PROCEEDINGS 2 [1:00 p.m.] 3 JUSTICE STEVENS: We will hear argument in 4 No. 06-618, the Office of Senator Mark Dayton against 5 Brad Hanson. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN M. MANNING 7 ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT 8 MS. MANNING: Justice Stevens and may it 9 please the Court: 10 If I may, I would like to quickly frame the 11 merits of the case and then turn to the jurisdictional 12 issue. In United States vs. Gravel this Court 13 recognized that members of Congress have to delegate 14 some of their legislative authority to employees and 15 these employees are a second self to the member. They 16 are performing some of the legislative duties the member 17 himself would otherwise perform. Therefore, they are an 18 integral part of the legislative process of the member's 19 office. For that reason, the member must have absolute 20 trust and confidence that these employees are in fact 21 performing as his second self, and to do that the member 22 has to have complete discretion in selecting who these 23 employees are and in managing them. 24 If a court oversees a member's selection of 25 these employees and his management of these employees,

1 then the court and not the member is managing part of 2 his legislative process and that is a violation of the 3 Speech or Debate Clause because the purpose of the 4 clause is to ensure that the legislative process will be 5 performed independently. Now -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you think -- do you 7 think that we owe any special measure of respect to the 8 Congress, that is most intimately concerned with the 9 Speech or Debate Clause, with their view that this is, 10 this legislation is compatible with that clause? 11 MS. MANNING: I do not, Justice Ginsburg. 12 This Court has never deferred to Congress with respect 13 to its interpretation and in fact has disagreed with 14 Congress, for example, in the Gravel case. But the 15 other reason is that the Congress of course is a 16 political body and because of that it will make 17 decisions that are politically expedient at times, which 18 means that over time their decisions can change, while 19 the Court is uniquely designed and intended to decide 20 cases on something other than what is politically 21 expedient. This is especially important when we are 22 dealing with the Constitution and interpreting the 23 Constitution. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what we are involved 25 with in this case is Congress subjecting itself to the
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 laws that govern all other employers. 2 MS. MANNING: It did, Justice Ginsburg, 3 subject itself, but it also in Section 413 recognized 4 that there may be Speech or Debate Clause issues and 5 maybe not all of these cases can be adjudicated in a 6 court. Not that they can't be adjudicated, but maybe 7 not in a court. So while subjecting itself to the law 8 and doing the best it could to do that, it also cannot 9 trump the Constitution. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is what the statute 11 says, and so how could the statute possibly be 12 unconstitutional? 13 MS. MANNING: We are not -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the Constitution -15 I mean, the statute has within itself a Speech or Debate 16 Clause exception. Now, I guess you can argue that a 17 lower court might not accurately provide the Speech or 18 Debate Clause protection that is due, but that, that 19 doesn't meet, it seems to me, the, the jurisdictional 20 requirement that, that the constitutionality of the 21 statute be called into question. 22 MS. MANNING: Well, Justice Scalia, we are 23 not arguing that the statute is unconstitutional. 24 Rather, it's an as-applied argument. What we are 25 arguing is that the issue that was before the circuit
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 court was whether the application of Section 408 to this 2 particular case -- and of course 408 is what gives the 3 Court jurisdiction -- whether applying that to this case 4 violates the Constitution. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that doesn't comply 6 with Section 412, which says that an appeal may be taken 7 directly to the Supreme Court from "any interlocutory or 8 final judgment decree of order of court upon the 9 constitutionality of any provision of the Act." Now, 10 and as-applied challenge is not a challenge to the 11 constitutionality of the provision. 12 MS. MANNING: Justice Scalia, in the United 13 States versus Eichman, that statute at issue there had 14 statutory direct appeal language that was exactly the 15 language of 412. 16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't there a further 17 problem here, though, that the order of the district 18 court gave no explanation? We have no way of knowing 19 exactly why the court ruled the way it did, and for that 20 reason the appeal, the review, was that the original 21 appeal was taken properly to the court of appeals, so 22 that we are here not on appellate jurisdiction, but cert 23 jurisdiction, if at all. 24 MS. MANNING: I believe that you can take 25 appellate jurisdiction of this case because, as I was
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 saying, in United -2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there'S no direct 3 appeal. We have appellate jurisdiction only if there's 4 a direct appeal and there's no direct appeal. This is 5 coming from the court of appeals. 6 MS. MANNING: Oh, Section 412 provides 7 direct appeal from either court, unlike the Flag 8 Protection Act direct appeal language, which must be 9 from the district court. Section 412 doesn't limit it 10 to an appeal from the district court. It can be either 11 one. 12 JUSTICE SOUTER: What pages are the text of 13 412 set out on? You're going to have to help me here. 14 MS. MANNING: I'm sorry. With respect to -15 it's at the jurisdictional statement at page 65a. And 16 the direct appellate language that was at issue in the 17 Flag Protection Act did limit the appeal to appeals from 18 the district court. But Section 412 is different from 19 that. It doesn't -20 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why wasn't the ruling 21 of the district court a ruling upon the 22 constitutionality of the statute as applied? As I 23 understand it, you moved to dismiss the case on the 24 ground that an individual performing the duties that 25 Mr. Dayton performed cannot sue a member of Congress for
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 employment discrimination and the district court denied 2 that. Why isn't that a ruling on the constitutionality 3 of the, of the statute as applied? 4 MS. MANNING: Well, Justice Alito, the 5 argument we made was that to reach that decision there 6 were a couple of sub-arguments the court had to reach. 7 We had argued that, number one, is there a waiver of 8 sovereign immunity? If not, then is an employee who 9 meets the I'll call the duties test that we've set out 10 in our brief, is that employee's claim jurisdictionally 11 barred from court review, and if so does Mr. Hanson meet 12 that duties test? Now, the court could have decided 13 that Mr. Hanson doesn't meet the duties test, therefore 14 we never have to reach the constitutional issue, and 15 that would have been a decision on his duties, not on 16 the Constitution. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: Was there a dispute about 18 the nature of his duties? 19 MS. MANNING: I'm sorry? 20 JUSTICE ALITO: Not how you characterize his 21 duties, but what his duties actually were. Was there a 22 dispute about that? 23 MS. MANNING: He did not dispute his duties. 24 What he disputed was -- what he said was that of the 25 duties we set forth in the affidavit -- and that was
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Mr. Kimball's declaration, which is at the 2 jurisdictional statement at 66a -- he said that they 3 represent only 5 percent of his legislative duties over 4 the course of his employment. Well, of course, we're 5 not setting forth every jurisdictional duty he had over 6 the course of his employment. So he -7 JUSTICE ALITO: But didn't the district 8 court rule that somebody performing those duties can 9 constitutionally be tried -- bring suit, and it doesn't, 10 and it doesn't violate the Speech or Debate Clause? So 11 I don't see how that's not a ruling on the 12 constitutionality of the statute as applied. 13 MS. MANNING: No, Justice Alito, the court 14 didn't rule that. The court just gave us a minute 15 order, and there's a possibility that it ruled that, but 16 there is a possibility that it just said it doesn't 17 matter what test you're telling me, counsel, because 18 this particular employee doesn't meet your test to begin 19 with. So I'm saying, the court could have said, I'm 20 saying he doesn't meet -21 JUSTICE BREYER: Don't you agree with 22 Justice Scalia -- Justice Alito? Don't you agree with 23 Justice Alito? I thought he's saying it's a ruling on 24 constitutionality. 25 MS. MANNING: It is a -- not the district
9

1 court ruling. Not the district court. The appellate 2 court, yes. I'm sorry, Justice Breyer. The appellate 3 court, yes; the district court, no, because the district 4 court was merely a minute order. And it's a possibility 5 that it could have been unconstitutional and a 6 possibility it could not. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: I see. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: My problem is, it's 9 extraordinary. We have very few direct appeal cases any 10 more and I, I am loathe to read Section 412 as embracing 11 a decision by a court that a particular use of this 12 statute was unconstitutional. You say it was, the 13 statute was unconstitutional as applied. That's sloppy 14 language. It really means that this application of the 15 statute or the use of the statute for this purpose was 16 unconstitutional. 17 I think that's something different from 18 saying that it was an order of the court upon the 19 constitutionality of any provision. Which provision of 20 this Act has been held to be unconstitutional? 21 MS. MANNING: Section 408 as applied to this 22 case is unconstitutional. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which -- but it hasn't been 24 held to be unconstitutional. It's perfectly 25 constitutional. You're just saying it can't be used in
10

1 this particular case. 2 MS. MANNING: Well, when Congress -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, read the language. 4 It says "The constitutionality of any provision of this 5 act," not "the constitutionality of the application of 6 any provision of this act." 7 MS. MANNING: Yes, and in United States 8 versus Eichman, Justice Scalia, the very same language 9 was at issue. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is that citation? I 11 was looking for that. Is that cited in your brief? 12 MS. MANNING: Yes, United States versus 13 Eichman is cited at the Appellant's reply brief at page 14 1. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you. 16 MS. MANNING: And the statutory section is 17 18 U.S.C. Section 700(d), and the direct appeal language 18 is exactly the same, "upon the constitutionality of a 19 provision of this act." And this Court accepted direct 20 appeal when the issue was whether the application of the 21 Flag Protection Act was unconstitutional. In any event, 22 even if this Court were not to take jurisdiction -23 JUSTICE STEVENS: But in the flag case the 24 whole statute was either valid or not. There weren't 25 different applications, were there?

1 MS. MANNING: Counsel argued both, but this 2 Court did not deal with both. This Court actually took 3 direct appeal just on the as-applied argument. Counsel 4 argued the statute was unconstitutional and the second 5 argument was -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean we held that the 7 statute was constitutional on its face? 8 MS. MANNING: What the Court held was -9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'll look at Eichman, but 10 it's not my recollection of the case, that the whole, 11 the essence of the duty imposed by, under the statute 12 was held. 13 MS. MANNING: It was the application in that 14 particular situation. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but there's always 16 an application or there's no case. 17 MS. MANNING: Well, the -18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Absent some declaratory 19 judgment provision. 20 JUSTICE STEVENS: We simply didn't rule hold 21 was a right to burn flags in some cases and not others. 22 MS. MANNING: Well, there were questions 23 that the parties raised. One was, is the statute 24 unconstitutional altogether. And the Court didn't even 25 touch that. Instead the second argument they raised was
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 well, is it constitutional -- unconstitutional, rather, 2 as applied on these facts? And that is what the Court 3 took the case on, that was what allowed direct 4 jurisdiction. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what had the lower 6 court held? It isn't a question of what we held; it's a 7 question of what the lower court had held. Had the 8 lower court held that it was unconstitutional? 9 MS. MANNING: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia, I 10 don't remember what the lower court held in that case -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, but that can mean 12 -- you can always dispose of a, of a facial challenge by 13 just saying we don't have to reach the facial question; 14 we can decide it on an as applied question. But in 15 order to get here in the first place, it has to be a 16 challenge to the constitutionality of a provision of the 17 Act. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And in we recite that the 19 district court held the Act unconstitutional as applied 20 to appellees and dismissed the charges. 21 MS. MANNING: Right. Unconstitutional as 22 applied so it was an as applied argument. And now when 23 the Court wants a statute to mean that it's only an 24 unconstitutional interpretation as opposed to a 25 constitutional interpretation, the Court -- I'm sorry,
13

1 Congress makes that distinction. So for example in 28 2 U.S.C. Section 1257, which was a direct appeals statute, 3 and has since been repealed, in that statute Congress 4 did say that there is direct appeal when the statute is 5 found to be constitutional, or when the statute is found 6 to be unconstitutional. But it used -- Congress, that 7 is, used the vague language, more vague and general 8 language in Section 412, which is just upon the 9 constitutionality. In any event -10 JUSTICE SOUTER: I realize, before you leave 11 that I realize that on a jurisdictional issue like that 12 we have an obligation to raise it ourselves. But I'm -13 I'm -- I'm curious, was -- was jurisdiction contested in 14 that case? 15 MS. MANNING: Not that I recall in the 16 Eichman case. Not that I recall. 17 JUSTICE SOUTER: 18 MS. MANNING: Okay. In any case, this Court 19 should accept the petition, take this case on a petition 20 for writ because the decision of the court of appeals 21 was upon a question of Federal law that is an important 22 question. 23 Moving to my Speech or Debate Clause 24 argument, with respect to Speech or Debate Clause, this 25 Court has held that all acts that are within the
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 legitimate legislative sphere are protected by Speech or 2 Debate Clause immunity. And the Court has defined what 3 is inside that sphere as anything that is part of the 4 due functioning of the legislative process. And when an 5 employee is an alter ego, that is, a second self of a 6 member, that employee by definition is actually 7 performing part of the member's job. He is performing 8 legislative acts so he is in this sphere. He is doing 9 something that is part of the due functioning of the 10 legislative process. He is in that sphere. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: What does he do? I mean I 12 looked at what he does in 74, 75, 76a. He seems to 13 spend a lot of time moving furniture. He lists that 14 twice. He runs the office. And he represents, he is 15 out in the local office somewhere and he talks to 16 constituents. I mean, he doesn't even appear in the 17 Senate office except very rarely in which case he is 18 doing casework. So I guess if he is included in that, I 19 mean so is a full-time furniture mover. 20 MS. MANNING: Justice Breyer, he did 21 significantly more than that. First -22 JUSTICE BREYER: I have the whole list here. 23 What here suggests, he ever -- he doesn't even write a 24 statement for the floor. There is nothing here that 25 suggests one word of anything he did ever went to a

1 committee meeting, to a floor of the Senate, anything. 2 MS. MANNING: Oh, Justice -3 JUSTICE BREYER: What? 4 MS. MANNING: Justice Breyer -5 JUSTICE BREYER: What are the words? 6 MS. MANNING: Actually in the Kimball 7 declaration, which is at jurisdictional statement 66a, 8 and the self evaluation of Mr. Hanson which is attached 9 thereto as a jurisdictional statement at 78a, and this 10 is his self evaluation and Mr. Kimball, his supervisor 11 at the time telling what he had done, he being 12 Mr. Hanson. 13 Some of the things Mr. Hanson did was he did 14 talk to constituents, but remember of course the member 15 is in D.C.; he is supposed to be representing people in 16 the State. The very people who have contact with -17 JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with that one. I 18 just said he doesn't do anything that gets to the floor 19 of the Senate, that gets to a committee report, that 20 gets to a committee hearing. Now what in there -- and 21 you said it was not contested, so I guess the best 22 source if it's not contested is his affidavit. 23 MS. MANNING: Justice Breyer actually he did 24 both of those. He for example, when talking to the 25 constituents realized that there was a problem with
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 respect to ambulance reimbursement for health care. He 2 went to the Senator and said we've got a problem here in 3 the State, and the constituents have identified it. He 4 then said to the Senator, I think you should draft 5 legislation on this and I think you should have a 6 committee hearing on this. Both of which the Senator 7 did. Mr. Hanson drafted that legislation. He -8 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Where does it say 9 that? He drafted legislation that was then introduced? 10 MS. MANNING: Yes, he did. He drafted -11 JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that? 12 MS. MANNING: That is in the Kimball 13 declaration which is jurisdictional statements at page 14 66a. And he also prepared the witnesses for the 15 hearings. Justice -- I'm sorry, Senator Dayton had the 16 hearing on the health care issue, and Mr. Hanson 17 identified the witnesses for that, prepared them, wrote 18 the questions for the hearing and -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he didn't do 20 exclusively that stuff anyway. We can certainly all 21 agree on that. And why isn't it sufficient that when 22 any of those issues are, his activities in any of those 23 capacities are sought to be introduced into evidence, 24 anyone tries to contradict them, then you can bring in 25 your Speech or Debate Clause objection?
17
Alderson Reporting Company

1 MS. MANNING: Because it is -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is the whole suit 3 precluded? 4 MS. MANNING: The whole suit is precluded 5 because when you have as we do an employee who is in 6 this legislative sphere, that the Court has identified, 7 he is in that sphere because he is performing 8 legislative acts. So a member who decides, you know, I 9 don't want him in my legislative duties anymore, my 10 sphere, I'm pulling him out. Taking him out, when the 11 member takes him out of that process, he has done 12 something -- he being the member -- that is also part of 13 the functioning of the legislative process, which is the 14 test. 15 So the termination itself is part of the 16 functioning of the legislative process which is the test 17 for a legislative act. And therefore this case is 18 predicated on a legislative act. That is, the 19 termination. And in Doe V. McMillan this Court stated 20 that a case that is predicated on a legislative cannot 21 be adjudicated. 22 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm puzzled. Firing 23 somebody is a legislative act? 24 MS. MANNING: I'm sorry, Justice Stevens? 25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Firing someone is a
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 legislative act? 2 MS. MANNING: Firing not anyone is a 3 legislative act, but firing your second self is a 4 legislative act. And the reason for that is that you 5 are doing something that is part of your legislative 6 process. You created a hole in your legislative 7 process; you have taken out an employee who is your 8 second self. This is your second self. And you've 9 decided, you know, I think my legislative process is 10 going to work better with him gone. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's part of -- how many 12 second selves would there be? 13 (Laughter.) 14 MS. MANNING: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg? 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: On the Senator's staff? 16 MS. MANNING: I'm sorry. I still didn't 17 hear. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many second selves? 19 Of -- what universe are you covering? Who is not a 20 second self, who works in a Senator's office? 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe he was the 23rd self. 22 (Laughter.) 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you have to figure 24 out when he was hired. 25 MS. MANNING: Well, in Gravel, in United
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 States vs. Gravel, this Court stated not only do you 2 have second selves, but you must -- members must 3 delegate and redelegate and redelegate authority. That 4 implies there are a lot of second selves. It's not one 5 person. So there can be -6 JUSTICE BREYER: What's wrong with this? I 7 found what you're talking about here. It says in 8 paragraph 13, contrary to what he says in his own 9 evaluation, that Senator Dayton's staff, including 10 Mr. Hanson -- that's a little uncertain, what they mean 11 by that -- introduced a bill and drafted it. Okay? And 12 then on paragraph 14 they say on November 15th, 2001, 13 Mr. Hanson -- just as you said -- planned a Senate 14 Government Affairs Committee meeting, selected hearing 15 witnesses and prepared questions. 16 Now suppose that we did as the court, lower 17 court wanted to do, say let's just see if that becomes 18 relevant. Because it's possible, given his other tasks 19 that those two incidents, one on November 15th and the 20 other, whenever help he gave to the drafting, had 21 nothing to do with his being fired and nobody claims 22 that. So what they said is let's wait and see if that 23 becomes relevant. Now what's wrong with that solution? 24 MS. MANNING: What's wrong with that 25 solution is that when a member, as I was explaining in
20

1 response to Justice Stevens' questions, when a member 2 has a second self who is in the legislative process and 3 the member says you know, I'm pulling him out of the 4 process because he doesn't perform well, he -- I don't 5 think he is my second self, that termination for 6 whatever reason is part of the process because the 7 member has changed the process. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Let's make an 9 absurd case out of it which I'm trying to do a little 10 bit to get you to focus on it. Let's suppose he got 11 fired because he didn't move the furniture properly. 12 MS. MANNING: The -- it is a whole employee. 13 When he is removed from the process for whatever reason, 14 he is gone from the process so that is part of the 15 functioning of the process. If I may give an example, 16 let's say that the Senator is at Union Station and he is 17 buying a gift for someone and he hears someone making 18 very derogatory statements to the cashier, and he turns 19 around and lo and behold, this is his legislative 20 director. And he says I can't have this person as my 21 second self; I don't talk to individuals that way; this 22 has nothing to do with my legislative process but this 23 is a second self and he is not my second self and I pull 24 him out of the process. 25 That has affected his legislative process.

1 He now has a hole in this sphere, this legislative 2 sphere. The person is gone. That is a part of his 3 legislative process. He didn't matter, why he is gone. 4 He is gone. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't that a -- can you 6 give me examples of cases where that Act applies? 7 MS. MANNING: I'm sorry? 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me instances 9 in which employees of an the office of a Senator are 10 covered by these obligations and cannot invoke the 11 Speech or Debate Clause? What's the classic example 12 where you can't invoke the Speech or Debate Clause? 13 MS. MANNING: Where you cannot invoke the 14 Speech or Debate Clause. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yeah. 16 MS. MANNING: Was that the question, or can? 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Because it seems to 18 me that your argument just completely eviscerates the 19 intent of the Congress in passing this Act. 20 MS. MANNING: If I may answer the second 21 question first, approximately 75 percent of the people 22 who are covered by this Act, the employees who are 23 covered by this Act are not employed by members of 24 Congress or committees. Now those employees for the 25 most part -- and not all of them, because some of those
22

1 employees do work on the floor, but for the most part -2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, except the Act 3 itself has a provision for office of Senators. 4 MS. MANNING: And those employees -5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so it seems to me 6 you're giving no effect to that. You say there is a 7 hole in the process the minute the furniture mover is 8 gone? 9 MS. MANNING: No, Justice Kennedy, those 10 employees -- first of all some of those employees can 11 sue. For example the Court has said that writing news 12 releases or newsletters to constituents, this is in the 13 Brewster case, are not, that is not a legislative act. 14 So if we have an employee in a member's office like the 15 deputy press secretary who does those kind of things, 16 that person is not performing legislative acts. But in 17 addition to that these employees still have a -- a 18 forum; their forum is the Office of Compliance, which is 19 unique to the Congressional Accountability Act. And the 20 Office of Compliance has cases heard before retired 21 judges; the employees get the same remedies as they 22 would in court. It is the same procedure except that it 23 is an expedited procedure and it is a confidential 24 procedure. 25 So these employees are, it's not that they
23

MANNING: With respect to the abatement 10 issue, I would -- this is with respect to the abatement 11 issue -- I would say that the case would not be abated, 12 because the defendant would still exist. But with 13 respect to the Speech or Debate Clause issue I would say 14 it could not still go forward, and the reason for that 15 is the immunity is, as this Court stated in Gravel, is 16 not like a badge that attaches to different people and 17 different entities. It's an expression of a policy, 18 which means that whenever a case is going to infringe 19 into this legislative sphere, irrespective of who the 20 defendant is, then the case could not be adjudicated in 21 a Federal court. 22 And so for example in Eastland versus 23 Servicemen's Fund this Court stated that a committee of 24 the Senate is covered by the Speech or Debate Clause. 25 And in Tenney although that was a State case, the Court
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 did apply the Speech or Debate Clause jurisprudence. 2 The Court there said that a committee of the State is 3 covered by the Speech or Debate Clause and the case 4 would be dismissed. 5 And then in Doe vs. McMillan, in that case 6 there was a consultant to Congress and he was sued. 7 There was functionaries of Congress that did not work 8 for a member, did not work for a committee and the Court 9 held in that case that if those, if the consultant and 10 the functionaries were performing duties that were 11 within this legislative sphere, the Speech or Debate 12 Clause clause applies and the case was dismissed. 13 JUSTICE ALITO: In what sense would the 14 member be called to answer under those circumstances, if 15 the member isn't a defendant and has no financial 16 liability and is able to invoke the clause as an 17 evidentiary privilege? In what sense would the Speech 18 or Debate Clause be applicable? 19 MS. MANNING: In the scenario where the 20 Congress is the defendant? 21 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. 22 MS. MANNING: Well, what we are arguing is 23 that the termination itself, the termination itself is a 24 legislative act because the termination itself is part 25 of the due functioning of the legislative process. And

Now also in answer to your question it doesn't 4 matter who the defendant is. The member, let's say 5 Congress was -6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well why doesn't it matter 7 who the defendant is? Because I don't, this so-called 8 office of Senator Mark Dayton is a construct that I 9 understand, and there is no immunity problem there. But 10 if, if that office is gone now and getting to your 11 hypothesis, if the, if -- if the true party is the 12 Senate of the United States, has there been any 13 unequivocal waiver of immunity with respect to the 14 entire Senator or the Senate of the United States as an 15 institution? 16 MS. MANNING: No Justice Ginsburg, there has 17 been no waiver -18 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm Justice Souter. 19 MS. MANNING: I'm sorry. Justice Souter, 20 sorry. Justice Souter -21 JUSTICE SOUTER: You're very flattering. 22 (Laughter.) 23 MS. MANNING: Sorry. Justice Souter, sorry, 24 Justice Souter. 25 There has been no waiver for the Senate as a

Section 1408 of the CAA which of course 2 gives the Court jurisdiction -3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but I was just going 4 to say if this case continues we've got to accept the 5 proposition that the Office of Senator Mark Dayton is 6 still a, some kind of an entity that has got to be 7 accorded reality by the judiciary, right. 8 MS. MANNING: That is correct, because -9 JUSTICE STEVENS: And how do we do it? I 10 mean, you've said -- I don't want to go too far with a 11 metaphor, but you spoke a moment ago of there being sort 12 of a, what did you say, a hole or a space in the 13 legislative sphere when somebody is fired. In the 14 sphere at the moment is totally empty. The Senator's 15 gone. Everybody knows that this, this office of Senator 16 Mark Dayton is a totally fictional construct. And in 17 reality, as you point out, the money is going to come 18 out of the Senate or some Senate fund. If we allow this 19 to go forward, we've got to face the reality that it's 20 the Senate which is the defendant and there hasn't been 21 a waiver of immunity. 22 MS. MANNING: I agree with that, Justice 23 Souter. There is no defendant that exists any more. 24 The only defendant in the CAA, and the language is very 25 express, is the employing office and the employing
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 office is defined in Section 1301(9) as, for purposes of 2 this case, "the personal office of a member of 3 Congress." And there is no member of Congress -4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but at this point 5 that's silly. There's no Senator. There's no office in 6 any sense. 7 MS. MANNING: I agree with you that there is 8 no defendant any more. This defendant has ceased to 9 exist and this case has abated. There is no successor 10 and when there is no successor there are not two 11 adversarial parties in the case. There's no case or 12 controversy, case is moot, and the case should be 13 dismissed on that basis alone. 14 Why -- the Court does not even have to reach 15 the jurisdictional issue with respect to the Speech or 16 Debate Clause because this case became moot in January 17 when the function of the office, which was solely to 18 support Senator Dayton -- when there was no Senator 19 Dayton there was no office of Senator Dayton. There is 20 no defendant that is extant in this case and therefore 21 the case -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: There's never an office. I 23 mean, I think the office is just a fictional construct 24 anyway. So what you say now has nothing to do with 25 whether, whether this current Senator has, has departed

1 from the scene. Even if he were still on the scene, 2 there still wouldn't be any such thing as that office. 3 It's just a fiction, and it would always be a suit 4 against Congress, and so you say none of these suits can 5 ever be brought. 6 MS. MANNING: Justice Scalia, it is not just 7 a fiction. The office -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't it a waiver of 9 sovereign immunity when you set up a suit that envisions 10 a suit which will be paid off by the Senate? Why isn't 11 that a waiver of sovereign immunity? 12 MS. MANNING: It is, Justice Scalia, a 13 waiver of sovereign immunity that has a condition on it. 14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is it unequivocal? 15 MS. MANNING: It is unequivocal -16 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, when it's done on 17 the basis of this fiction, is that what we should accept 18 as an unequivocal waiver? 19 MS. MANNING: Well, first, I disagree with 20 the premise in that I don't think it is a fiction that 21 this office never existed. The office, the personal 22 office of a member of Congress -- members of Congress 23 didn't work out in the hallway before the CAA was 24 passed. There was always a personal office of a member 25 of Congress. So in that sense it is not a fiction.

MANNING: Well, actually the structure 8 doesn't support that. The Senate, within the Senate, 9 each member does pay the salary, sets the salary. We 10 can have legislative directors and do have legislative 11 directors in two different offices, different salaries, 12 different numbers of paid days, different number of 13 annual leave days. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Setting it is quite 15 different from paying it. 16 MS.

The Senate puts a 23 limit on how much money it will spend for a particular 24 Senator. That's all that amounts to. It doesn't hand 25 him the money. It's still the Senate's money, isn't it?

SALZMAN 10 ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE 11 MR. SALZMAN: Justice Stevens and may it 12 please the Court: 13 The motion to dismiss in this case raised a 14 single issue, the issue of absolute immunity; more 15 specifically, whether the employing office created by 16 Congress as the defendant in these kinds of cases can be 17 sued by a member of a Senator or a House of 18 Representatives staff. The Dayton office argues that a 19 Senator's personnel decisions are always a legislative 20 act that are always absolutely immunized by the Speech 21 or Debate Clause. That argument is untenable and it was 22 rejected by every one of the eight judges of the D.C. 23 Circuit en banc. 24 This case doesn't involve any administrative 25 acts. Mr. Hanson didn't work on Capitol Hill. He was
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 in the Minnesota office. His, the nature of his claim 2 is that he was a valued employee until he became ill and 3 disclosed his illness and need for surgery, at which 4 point he was fired. Senator Dayton's office first says 5 that they were not even aware, that Senator Dayton was 6 unaware of the need for surgery at the time he made the 7 decision to fire Mr. Hanson, and then says that the 8 reason for the firing was Mr. Hanson's work on a classic 9 constituent service. 10 This case presents exactly the hypothetical 11 that Justice Breyer was asking about. Although 12 Mr. Hanson had a very small, he says 5 percent of his 13 duties, that were in some way related to the legislative 14 process, no one contends, not Mr. Kimball, not Senator 15 Dayton's office, that that had anything to do with the 16 reason for his firing. In fact, the only evidence in 17 the record, in this record so far, is that on that small 18 amount of work that Mr. Hanson did with respect to 19 ambulance legislation, he did a, quote unquote, "great 20 job." 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: The other side's contention 22 is that the firing is itself a legislative act and so 23 when you challenge the firing you are challenging the 24 legislative act. What do you say to that? 25 MR. SALZMAN: We say that's absolutely wrong
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Justice Scalia, that is absolutely wrong. The reason is 2 that this Court has said that conduct that is related to 3 the legislative process, that may in fact be important 4 to the legislative process, is not itself a part of the 5 legislative process. That is the fundamental holding of 6 Brewster. And this Court has found that some actions 7 that affect an employee, for example in the Bogan case, 8 where a decision that resulted in the termination of a 9 person was clearly legislative in nature because it was 10 made in a legislative proceeding, it was voted upon by 11 the legislators, and it was based upon either budgetary 12 or policy determinations. 13 That is a legislative act. But this Court 14 in Bogan specifically distinguished that circumstance 15 from a classic personnel action firing such as happened 16 to Mr. Hanson here. There was no legislative act 17 involved in Mr. Hanson's firing. He was just fired. 18 The reason for the firing is at issue in this case. A 19 jury can sort out issues like whether or not Senator 20 Dayton had notice of the need for surgery, whether or 21 not Mr. Hanson's performance of classic constituent 22 services was bad or good, as we contend. 23 But none of that involves legislative 24 activity as this Court has described it under the speech 25 or debate act. So our contention is that the only issue
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 in this case is absolute immunity and there is no 2 absolute immunity in this case. This case does not 3 involve a legislative act, as Judge Randolph below and 4 all of the judges below recognized. 5 JUSTICE STEVENS: What if his dissent -- or 6 defense, rather, to the charge is that he was very 7 inefficient in giving me help in legislative hearings 8 and so forth, or words of that kind which might be 9 arguably a legislative act, and that Speech or Debate 10 Clause forbids inquiry into the quality of his 11 performing those duties? 12 MR. SALZMAN: Justice Stevens, certainly the 13 Speech or Debate Clause does incorporate -- I'm sorry. 14 The Congressional Accountability Act does incorporate 15 the Speech or Debate Clause with respect to the 16 evidentiary privilege and that is clear from Section 17 413. In that instance, district courts will have to 18 deal with the proffered evidence on a case-by-case 19 basis. Obviously, the context matters with respect to 20 any evidentiary privilege. 21 JUSTICE STEVENS: But maybe the Senator 22 might argue that this is all privileged: It's the 23 reason I fired him, but I can't go into it because I 24 don't want to invade my own privilege not to discuss 25 matters that are covered by the immunity.

1 MR. SALZMAN: Well, Justice Stevens, again 2 if the reason for the firing would shed light if the 3 district court would show that the allowing the evidence 4 that is proffered in would so intrude upon a real 5 legislative act, then the district court can excise that 6 evidence from the case. It either can be taken out, as 7 in the Helstoski case. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the test for 9 intruding? If it would chill his exercise of the 10 function in future cases, or if it requires him to talk 11 about legislative decisions, or what? 12 MR. SALZMAN: I think, as this Court has 13 described it, Justice Kennedy, if it would compel the 14 Senator to testify about his motives for legislation or 15 for a legislative act, then a district court could 16 decide that that evidence would not come in. The firing 17 itself, however, is not a legislative act and the 18 motivation behind the firing is not precluded by the 19 Speech or Debate Clause. 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What if it required him to 21 say how he allocated his resources, that he allocate his 22 resources 10 percent to foreign affairs issues, 50 23 percent to health care issues? Would that involve is -24 is that a Speech or Debate Clause problem? 25 MR. SALZMAN: I don't believe that it would,
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 be Justice Kennedy. I don't think that that would 2 intrude so much on his goals with respect to a 3 particular piece of legislation or with respect to a 4 general legislative agenda. I'm not sure I would see 5 that his testifying about how he has allocated money in 6 the office, for example, would be anything other than 7 testimony about an administrative decision. 8 If he were -- for example, if a plaintiff 9 certainly attempted to introduce evidence in a case 10 about a speech that the Senator gave on the floor of the 11 Senate in which he was accused of making maybe a bigoted 12 or a sexist remark, Section 413 would clearly preclude 13 that. And there may be circumstance, for example, where 14 if a plaintiff wanted to introduce a draft of the speech 15 or a draft of legislation, that a court, district court, 16 could in those circumstances say that that intrudes so 17 much on a true legislative act that the court could 18 preclude that testimony from going in. 19 We don't believe that in the, in the run of 20 these cases, that will be difficult for the district 21 courts to handle. 22 JUSTICE STEVENS: That doesn't quite capture 23 the problem that I'm having. It's not that the 24 plaintiff can't inquire. Usually they can't. But my 25 thought is that the defendant cannot put in his own
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 defense without waiving the privilege that would 2 otherwise be applicable. So he's sort of in a dilemma. 3 Either I give up my constitutional right not to talk 4 about this stuff or I've got to waive that right in 5 order to give a full explanation of why I discharged the 6 plaintiff. 7 MR. SALZMAN: Understood, Justice Stevens. 8 I think that in most cases that will not present a 9 dilemma. Even if the Senator's explanation is, I 10 assigned a real legislative aide to research a piece of 11 legislation and I was dissatisfied for whatever reason, 12 suppose the reason is that the aide simply didn't turn 13 in the memo that that he was assigned to do. The 14 Senator testifying about, I gave an assignment to this 15 person, the due date was September 1st, I never got it 16 or he was late or it was riddled with errors -17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Or he just wrote a lousy 18 memo. In order to demonstrate it's lousy, I've got to 19 talk about legislative matters. 20 MR. SALZMAN: If that is truly the situation 21 and if a district court assessing, once all of the 22 information is presented to the district court, that 23 requiring the Senator in that circumstance to discuss 24 really his legislative goals, we think that maybe that 25 evidence would not be permitted. Now, the, this court
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 has recognized -2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if the Senator did 3 not have a defense? 4 MR. SALZMAN: Well, in Brewster, Your Honor, 5 this Court recognized that there may be situations where 6 the court permits an indictment to go forward, in which 7 the indictment itself and the proof that the prosecutor 8 will be presenting does not so intrude on the 9 legislative process that it would be precluded but that 10 the Defendant may decide that in order to explain the 11 accusation he needs to rely on legislative acts. And 12 the court recognized that that may be the situation that 13 the Senator is in. I believe the Third Circuit in a 14 decision written by Justice Alito, the McDade case, 15 talks about that circumstance, where the Senator at that 16 point can choose to put in his explanation and be 17 subject to cross-examination simply with respect to that 18 explanation, but that the prosecution is not precluded 19 in its entirety. And certainly that's what we are 20 talking about here. 21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but what if the 22 Senator doesn't want to put it in? I mean, what if he 23 does not want to waive the privilege? Is his only 24 choice in effect to sit moot and lose the case? 25 MR. SALZMAN: Well, if he chooses to sit
38

1 moot and if the evidence -2 JUSTICE SOUTER: "Mute" I guess I should 3 have said. 4 MR. SALZMAN: Mute, I'm sorry. 5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 6 MR. SALZMAN: If he chooses to stay silent, 7 then perhaps the case just goes forward without an 8 explanation. The defendant -9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why don't, why 10 doesn't that -- why doesn't being placed in that dilemma 11 in effect implicate the clause, and why can't he invoke 12 the clause as a basis for dismissal? 13 MR. SALZMAN: Well, Judge Randolph below 14 thought that there may be circumstances where the 15 evidence is so, all of the evidence is so bound up in a 16 legislative act that the case might not go forward. We 17 respectfully disagree with that. We think that that 18 will rarely be the circumstance. But this is the system 19 that Congress set up and Congress created the system in 20 a, in a careful way. The defendant is not the member. 21 The member faces no financial liability whatsoever from 22 a finding of discrimination or unlawful behavior. 23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, yes, so far as the 24 member's immediate financial concern, they took care of 25 it. But I'm not sure about the careful way. They in
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 effect said, you know, if this gets into Speech or 2 Debate Clause issues they prevail. And that kind of 3 just leaves us with no solution for the problem that 4 Justice Stevens raised and that I'm concerning with, 5 unless there's, there's going to be an automatic 6 dismissal when the member says, look, I cannot respond 7 to this without getting into, into acts within the 8 legislative process which are privileged. 9 Unless you want to recognize that as kind of 10 an absolute defense upon its invocation, I don't see how 11 we get out of the problem. 12 MR. CABALLERO: Well, Justice Souter, our 13 argument is that the decision itself is certainly not a 14 legislative act, and the most -- and that is in 15 accordance with this Court's view of the judicial 16 privilege in Forrester that the decision itself is not a 17 judicial act. The reasons behind the decision in the 18 legislative context could be shielded by the evidentiary 19 privilege, but we think there's a clear difference 20 between the employees performing a duty that is related 21 to the legislative process being different than a 22 legislative act itself. 23 It may be that in some rare circumstances 24 the Senator in order to fully defend himself feels the 25 need to actually testify about real legislative acts,
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 such as votes on something or his conduct in a committee 2 proceeding. But his assessment of an employee's 3 performance, just as Judge White's assessment in the 4 Forrester case of Miss Forrester's performance, is not 5 legislative activity. It may be activity that is 6 important to the legislative process. It may provide 7 for a sound legislative arena, just as in the judicial 8 sphere. But when this Court found unanimous, 9 unanimously that when Judge White was assessing the 10 performance of Miss Forrester in the judicial context 11 and deciding, I don't think she did a good job on 12 delegated judicial functions, that's not a judicial act. 13 And we would say the same with respect to a legislative 14 act, so -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would go for a 16 stenographer in a committee hearing? 17 MR. SALZMAN: Yes, Your Honor, and I believe 18 that's the Browning case, that the D.C. Circuit 19 originally had found would be considered a legislative 20 act. And we do believe that, yes, the assessment by 21 the, whoever supervised Miss Browning that her 22 performance was inadequate is not itself a legislative 23 activity. Miss Browning's performance obviously was 24 involved, was closely tied to the legislative process 25 because she was a stenographer at hearings. If the
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 committee, if the committee decided in a committee 2 proceeding and took a vote that they were not going to 3 use stenographers any more and Miss Browning had brought 4 a challenge with respect to that, alleging that it was 5 focused personally on her and racially motivated, then 6 we think a legislative immunity might apply as it did in 7 the Bogan case. 8 But absent that, it's our belief that an 9 assessment of an employee's performance, even if the 10 employee is performing duties that are related to the 11 legislative process, is not itself a legislative act. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it could or couldn't 13 be. I mean, I mean if the legislator, the Senator, 14 says, I think relevant to my dismissal of this 15 individual is the individual's performance that revealed 16 itself in a speech or debate that I gave in the House, 17 and if that's relevant, then why isn't that the end of 18 the case, they can't bring it? 19 MR. SALZMAN: Justice Breyer, I think that 20 that is one of the rare circumstances where the, the 21 Senator's assessment of the performance is very tied up 22 with a legislative act. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, all he'd have to say 24 is it's relevant to my decision to fire the person. 25 Now, surely a jury or whoever -- it's probably a jury
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 matter, I guess, on this -- is entitled to take that 2 into account. If it's something the jury is entitled to 3 take into account, you are questioning what that Senator 4 did in the speech or debate and you are questioning it 5 in another place, namely, a court. 6 MR. SALZMAN: You are, Justice Breyer. The 7 employee's performance, we believe, of the speech 8 writing would not be considered a legislative act. This 9 Court said in Gravel that there is a difference between 10 a legislative act which goes on in a committee 11 proceeding and preparation for that proceeding, and the 12 employee's performance getting the Senator ready to give 13 his speech would not itself be considered a legislative 14 act, but in that circumstance the district court might 15 say that because the Senator's explanation is so clearly 16 tied to a real legislative act, a speech that he 17 actually gave on the floor of the Congress, perhaps that 18 might be a circumstance where judge Randolph's view that 19 that case could not go forward might apply. 20 That's not this case. This case deals with 21 threshold immunity issues, where the Senator's office is 22 saying that any personnel decision that it engages in is 23 by definition a legislative act if it relates to anybody 24 who works in their office. And Congress clearly was not 25 of that view. It defined every employee of the Senate,
43

1 including those who worked in a Senator's office, to be 2 a covered employee and all covered employees under 3 Section 408 have the right to go to court. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have any cases gone 5 through a district court on the merits under this Act? 6 MR. SALZMAN: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg? 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have any cases under this 8 Act gone to a district court to judgment on the merits? 9 MR. SALZMAN: No, Justice Ginsburg. The 10 closest -- my understanding is the closest we have 11 gotten is the companion case in this case, the Fields 12 case, is scheduled for trial in October and it is my 13 understanding that they have gone through some discovery 14 in that case. I don't believe that there have been any, 15 any cases under the Congressional Accountability Act in 16 court, that have made it past that. 17 If there are no further questions -18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one question. The 19 Appellants here were the ones that appealed to the court 20 of appeals? Did they appeal from the district court? 21 MR. SALZMAN: Yes. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But under 1291, the United 23 States Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction where 24 direct review may be had in the Supreme Court. So it 25 seems to me that their position contradicts their own
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 basis for jurisdiction here. Do you agree with that? 2 MR. SALZMAN: Not entirely, Justice Kennedy. 3 We do -- we had thought that initially and then upon 4 reflection it seemed to us that because the minute order 5 of the district -- because the order of the district 6 court was a minute order that did not explain its 7 reasoning, perhaps there was some ambiguity about 8 whether he was simply finding that Mr. Hanson had so 9 little contact with the legislative process that, that 10 the case should go forward or whether he was in essence 11 -12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but my point is that 13 the Appellants are telling us that this is appealable 14 here directly, but if that's so they shouldn't have gone 15 to court of appeals, they shouldn't have gone to the 16 court of appeals; they're untimely when they come here. 17 MR. SALZMAN: That is our understanding of 18 the way it generally works. We believe that the GYRA 19 statute, which was the predecessor to the Congressional 20 Accountability Act, may have permitted appeals directly 21 from the court of appeals to this court. So there 22 appears to be some ambiguity. When we first responded 23 with respect to the appeal, we did argue that if Senator 24 Dayton's office wanted to appeal directly they needed to 25 do that two years ago when the district court had ruled.

CABALLERO: Because, as we said in our 2 brief, the decision of the court of appeals was a 3 decision on the scope of the Speech or Debate Clause as 4 that clause is preserved in Section 413 of the act and 5 therefore there would be no appeal under Section 412. 6 If the court does go to the merits in this 7 matter, I think it's important to effectuate Congress' 8 intent in enacting the statute along with its concerns 9 with the Speech or Debate Clause. The Speech or Debate 10 Clause provides senators and representatives with a 11 constitutional privilege that is critical to securing 12 the independence of the legislative branch in our system 13 of government. 14 Certainly, Congress is the institution that 15 has the greatest interest in and is most sensitive to 16 maintaining a robust speech or debate privilege under 17 this Court's precedence. In enacting the Congressional 18 Accountability Act, however, Congress concluded that it 19 could provide its own employees with the same employment 20 law protections that it had already provided Executive 21 Branch employees and private sector employees, including 22 the critical right of action for victims of illegal 23 discrimination to bring suit in the Federal court; and 24 that a suit under the Act would not infringe upon the 25 Speech or Debate Clause.

1 Congress relied on this Court's own 2 precedent in making that determination. Under the 3 Speech or Debate Clause, this Court has made clear that 4 the clause is robust, protects activities outside of 5 just speech and debate on the floor of either House, but 6 that it shouldn't be extended beyond what is necessary 7 to preserve the independence of the legislative process. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Can we go back a step. I 9 just -- you said this is appealable and your reason for 10 it being appealable was because the statute itself -11 you said it was not appealable and the reason not is 12 because the statute itself said that this has to be 13 applied consistent with the Speech or Debate Clause? 14 MR. CABALLERO: Correct. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: That's your reason. So I 16 take it, what about the reason that's been given, that 17 this is an as-applied challenge instead of on its face? 18 What about that as a reason for it not being appealable? 19 MR. CABALLERO: Well, that is an application 20 of Section 412, the preservation of Speech or Debate 21 Clause in the statute. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no, I'm not asking 23 about the argument you are making. I want to ask about 24 an argument you aren't making, that the reason -- I'll 25 ask about the one you are making in a second. The
48

1 reason I want to know about -- I want to know about the 2 other possible reason for not being appealed, namely 3 that this is as applied and not on its face. They don't 4 strike down any provision. What's your view about that 5 one? 6 MR. CABALLERO: Our view is that that is 7 correct, Your Honor. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: That is correct. And what 9 you do about this case, what is it, Eichman? 10 MR. CABALLERO: The Eichman case they cited. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In Eichman, I was able to 12 get out the district court and the last part of the 13 district court, the last line of the district court, it 14 says the law under which these three -- let me begin 15 again -- the law under which these three defendants have 16 been prosecuted is unconstitutional, which seems to me 17 to contradict what Appellant's counsel told us about 18 what happened in the district court. 19 MR. CABALLERO: I think that's correct. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't matter anyway, 21 because our prior decisions that do not explicitly refer 22 to jurisdictional questions are not authority on 23 jurisdiction. 24 MR. CABALLERO: That's correct. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: We have that firm rule:
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 When we take a case and don't get into the 2 jurisdictional question, it is not precedent for the 3 fact -- 4 MR. CABALLERO: For a finding of 5 jurisdiction later, that's correct. 6 I would say -7 JUSTICE BREYER: So then a holding of a 8 district court in your opinion, the holdings say, 9 imaginary, is that no one who actually works in an 10 office of a Senator and who ever worked on any matter 11 having to do with legislation falls within this Act 12 because that would violate the speech and debate clause. 13 That would be quite major in its implication. But 14 you're saying there is no appeal on that because it's as 15 applied. 16 MR. CABALLERO: Right. Based on the court 17 of appeals decision, I would say the two arguments as 18 applied in the preservation of Section 413 aren't wholly 19 separate. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: Does that mean if I go to 21 your argument -- I mean, the problem with your argument 22 it seems to me is that that leaves no room for this 23 appellate provision at law, because the only reason that 24 anything is likely to be unconstitutional in this area, 25 at least 99 percent of it, would be Speech or Debate
50
Alderson Reporting Company

1 Clause violation. So in that interpretation of the 2 statute there is no direct appeal, or hardly ever. 3 MR. CABALLERO: Well, there was a lot of 4 discussion in the legislative history about the 5 separation of powers generally. 6 JUSTICE ALITO: We were told that 75 percent 7 of the employees who were covered by the Act do not work 8 for an individual member. So how could, how could a 9 provision to be facially unconstitutional under the 10 Speech or Debate Clause? 11 MR. CABALLERO: Well, I think the provision 12 wasn't held facially unconstitutional. 13 JUSTICE ALITO: What could it possibly be? 14 And if it couldn't possibly be then what did Congress 15 have in mind when it provided it for an interlocutory 16 appeal from a ruling on the constitutionality of the 17 statute. 18 MR. CABALLERO: Again, there was major 19 debate in the Congress over whether or not the provision 20 of judicial hearing of suits over congressional 21 employment decisions, separate from the Speech or Debate 22 Clause, just a separation of powers concern of having 23 the judiciary oversee the workings of Congress, and 24 there was a concern about that separation of powers 25 issue, which would be a facial issue. Can you hear any
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 suits by employees of Congress who are employed in a 2 separate branch? 3 And that was where this provision has life, 4 and is meant to protect the ability for a litigant to 5 bring it before this Court immediately; it would be a 6 facial challenge. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. That, that may make 8 sense. I, I wondered why -- why they would provide for 9 an appeal on constitutionality if they had in mind the 10 Speech or Debate Clause stuff, when the legislation 11 itself says that nothing herein shall be deemed a 12 violation of speech. 13 MR. CABALLERO: Right. It preserves a 14 member's -- exactly. It preserves a member's speech or 15 debate. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah. 17 MR. CABALLERO: And when Congress did 18 provide these rights under the statute, it was very 19 important for the Congress under the previous regime 20 affecting the Senate, employees had employment 21 protections and they had administrative processes that 22 they could go to. But they lacked a judicial right. 23 And Congress made a specific decision that providing 24 that right of action was an important employment law 25 protection employees needed.

1 And again it relied on this Court's 2 decisions both under the Speech or Debate Clause as to 3 the scope of the clause and under Forrester where this 4 Court held that a judge's employment decision as to an 5 employee who did judicial duties was not a judicial act, 6 did -- achieve absolute immunity. It was a -- it was an 7 administrative act, an employment act. 8 And similarly here what is brought before 9 the courts is an employment act. Again this case is 10 before the Court on a motion to dismiss. There has been 11 no discovery. There has been no litigation over the 12 claims involved. There is just a question presented 13 does the Speech or Debate Clause bar the jurisdiction of 14 Federal courts when a legislative, an employee with any 15 legislative duties brings a suit under the Act? And I 16 think the question, the answer to that question has to 17 be no. 18 Indeed in the case here, you could have 19 litigation over whether the Senator knew of the alleged 20 disability. That's one of the disputes that's been laid 21 out in the pleadings, whether that was the basis for 22 the, for the decision to terminate the employee. 23 These are all the types of issues that play 24 out in district courts. District courts receive 25 evidence. They make these judgments; they see the
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 specific context and they make specific rulings. To try 2 to decide in the abstract how you would apply an 3 employment law case with the Speech or Debate Clause in 4 an evidentiary sense is very difficult. And that's why 5 a more full record would be necessary. But to decide 6 the question on appeal, I think the Court can easily 7 decide if these cases go forward. 8 One last point I would like to make is to 9 address the issue of the existence of the office. It's 10 not a mere creation of the Act. Senators have personal 11 offices. Those offices incur liabilities or 12 obligations. They buy paper; they make contracts and 13 the like. When a Senator leaves office, the employing 14 office still has to pay the bills that were incurred 15 when the Senator was in office. And the Senate allows 16 employing offices under the approval of the former 17 member to submit the vouchers and receive payment. The 18 employing office has life afterwards. 19 Similarly here, if it incurs an employment 20 liability it has life sufficient to litigate whether or 21 not that liability exists and a judgment will be paid 22 under Government funds under the Act. 23 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it will -- the money is 24 simply Senate money. 25 MR. CABALLERO: Yes. The money is an
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 appropriation of Senate -- and under the fund, the money 2 is an appropriation for the specific fund under the Act 3 for paying judgements in these cases. 4 JUSTICE SOUTER: But none of those funds 5 are, as I understand it, are somehow subtracted from or 6 contributed by the funds of individual senatorial 7 offices while a Senator is in office. I am assuming 8 that those, that there is a separate appropriation for 9 the payment of -- of any such judgment, is that correct? 10 MR. CABALLERO: Under the Act there is. 11 Congress decided to not have any personal liability for 12 a member to shield them from that, and also not to 13 require the member's office in cases such as illegal 14 discrimination cases, to pay the awards or judgments. 15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. In the real world 16 then at this point isn't the Senate the -- the party? 17 MR. CABALLERO: Perhaps it's a party in 18 interest, but I would say again that the named party is 19 not a party without any life except under the Act. 20 I thank the Court. 21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Manning, you have 22 about a minute left. 23 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JEAN M. MANNING, 24 ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT 25 MS. MANNING: There are four instances in
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 which the Court has found that jurisdiction is barred in 2 Speech or Debate Clause cases. The first is when the 3 case is predicated on a legislative act. The second is 4 when the case cannot, that is cannot be adjudicated 5 without questioning a legislative act or the motive for 6 the act. And the third is when the member will be made 7 to answer in terms of his defense for a legislative act. 8 This goes to the question that Justice 9 Stevens asked. In Gravel the Court made it clear that 10 if the member is made to answer in his defense for a 11 legislative act, that violates the Speech or Debate 12 Clause. Under the, these types of cases the member 13 does, would have to come forward and explain a 14 legislative act: that is, why did I terminate this 15 employee? 16 That is the explanation, because the 17 termination itself is a legislative act, he is being 18 questioned about a legislative act. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. I have one -- one 20 question. Could the Senate direct you to pay this 21 judgment? 22 MS. MANNING: Direct me -- I'm sorry. Me 23 personally? 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Direct your office to -25 to do that.
56

1 MS. MANNING: To pay the judgment? 2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it -- suppose they 3 thought there was liability and if you say yes, then I 4 need to know why you and counsel who just addressed this 5 are on different sides of the case, if you're both 6 representing the Senate. 7 MS. MANNING: They cannot direct us to pay. 8 It of course comes out of the Treasury fund and the 9 Senate has had absolutely no control or involvement at 10 all for 12 years in any of these cases. They do not 11 know -12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could it, if it chose? 13 MS. MANNING: Well, I believe that it cannot 14 because the defendant in this case is the employing 15 office. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. 17 MS. MANNING: So for that reason the Senate 18 has never, doesn't even know the cases exist. Doesn't 19 know that we are negotiating settlement. Doesn't review 20 settlement agreements. Is not involved in strategy. In 21 fact the CAA in Section 403 states that the, that the 22 mediation and then the counseling in the case is 23 strictly confidential. The Senate cannot even know that 24 they are happening. Only the employing office can know. 25 In no sense has the Senate been the defendant. If the

They have not been in these cases for 5 twelve years. 6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Manning. 7 The case is submitted. 8 MS.
