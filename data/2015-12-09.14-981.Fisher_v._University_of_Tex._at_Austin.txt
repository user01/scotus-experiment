3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 this morning in Case 14981, Fisher v. The University of

5 Texas at Austin.

6             Before we get started, I'll advise the

7 lawyers that this is our only case this morning, so we

8 intend to grant the parties ten minutes or so of extra

9 time and the amicus five minutes.

10             So Mr. Rein, no need to rush.

11             (Laughter.)

12                ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERT REIN

13                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14             MR. REIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

15 please the Court:

16             I appreciate the extra time, and I didn't

17 rush up here to start before you invited me this time.

18             In reviewing the Fifth Circuit's initial

19 decision in what we call Fisher I, seven members of this

20 Court reaffirmed that a clear precondition to the use of

21 race as an admissions factor was the ability to satisfy

22 what was called the "demanding burden of strict

23 scrutiny" articulated in Grutter and Bakke.

24             By establishing that she was considered for

25 admission to UT under a system that discriminated

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
4 1 against her on the basis of her race, Ms. Fisher placed 2 upon UT the burden of  of proving, by evidence of 3 record, that its use of race was, first, in pursuit of a 4 compelling, constitutionally legitimate interest 5 expressed with sufficient clarity and concreteness to 6 allow a reviewing court to determine, first, that the 7 use of race was a necessary last resort in pursuing the 8 interest defined, taking into account reasonably 9 available nonracial alternatives. 10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Rein, may I ask, if 11 we didn't have the 10 percent plan, if that were out of 12 this case, and all that were left were the Grutterlike 13 plan, would you then recognize that you had no claim? 14             We have the  what  what the University 15 of Texas has added on to the 10 percent plan.  But now 16 we wipe out the 10 percent, and we have only the 17 Grutterlike plan. 18             MR. REIN:  Well, I  with respect, I  I 19 would question the premise of the question because it's 20 not the Grutterlike plan in its entirety. 21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I know it's not  22             MR. REIN:  That would be a totally 23 different  24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   but  but I'm asking 25 the hypothetical.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
5 1             MR. REIN:  No.  And I'm saying even in the 2 AI/PAI system it's not a Grutterlike plan.  It's not a 3 plan of shaping a class by individualized onetoone 4 comparisons.  It's not aimed at a critical mass.  It's 5 not a Grutter plan in that sense. 6             But I think the  the other part of this is 7 that's, of course, not the case before us.  When you 8 look at the satisfaction of a compelling interest, you 9 look and ask:  Does my preexisting system satisfy that 10 interest?  Do I have a need to do something else?  And 11 if I have a need to do something, is that something  12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Assume need was proven. 13 I know.  You're  you're  you're  we're putting 14 aside need.  What's wrong with this plan if need is put 15 aside? 16             MR. REIN:  Well, let's put it this way:  We 17 do not oppose the use of the various PAI factors that 18 were in place before race was added.  What's wrong with 19 this plan, apart  20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no, no, no. 21             MR. REIN:  And  22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know you're saying 23 they don't need to do it.  I said put it aside and 24 answer Justice Ginsburg's question. 25             MR. REIN:  And I  yes, and

6 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If they had to use race, 2 how are they using it improperly? 3             MR. REIN:  If you have to use race and you 4 want to use the model that was created in Bakke and 5 Grutter, you would need to build profiles of individuals 6 that would allow you to judge them one against another 7 in the context of the class and the educational 8 experience you are trying to create. 9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  My God, that sounds like 10 it's using race more rather than less than this plan 11 does. 12             MR. REIN:  I  I'm sorry if it sounds that 13 way.  It is not.  It simply says, in a situation of the 14 Bakke situation where you're looking at every aspect of 15 an individual and you're trying to judge whether one or 16 another of individuals for the  for places, the last 17 places would most benefit the class, the class as a 18 whole as a learning entity, then you can, as Bakke 19 indicates, take account of the fact that they may have 20 different backgrounds, which would contribute different 21 ideas. 22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How does that  23             MR. REIN:  Those are wholeperson 24 comparisons.  This is not the system that  this system 25 doesn't do anything like Bakke.

7 1             So if  it's very different.  Even if you 2 separate it from the necessity issue  which is, of 3 course, a major issue in this case, but I'm assuming 4 your question  that they've shown that they needed to 5 use race, there was no other way to do whatever they 6 were trying to do  which isn't clear to me either  7 so you have both the question of whether they've defined 8 a legitimate compelling interest; you have the question 9 of whether they've shown any necessity to use race.  But 10 if I  even I put those aside, whether this is the 11 narrowly tailored vision that came out of Bakke is a 12 very serious question.  It isn't.  It's quite different. 13 And I can  14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You still haven't 15 answered why this is worse than Bakke.  I mean  16             MR. REIN:  Because it  it's not used to 17 build a class.  It's just used to create a racial plus 18 and to increase the number of minority admissions. 19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How is race given  20             MR. REIN:  It's race as such. 21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How is race given a 22 plus? 23             I  I thought that what they're looking for 24 is leaders in diversity, not just of race, but of 25 experiences generally.

1             MR. REIN:  Those factors 

8

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how 

3             MR. REIN:  I'm sorry.  But those factors

4 were in the PAI before they added race.  Leadership;

5 demonstrated awards and success out of school;

6 overcoming obstacles, like a singleparent family.

7 Those were all part of the PAI before race was added.

8 Race was just tacked on, as they said, as a factor of a

9 factor of a factor.

10             They've shifted position as to how it's

11 used.  In the  in the district court, it was sort of

12 minimized, a factor of a factor of a factor.  It's a

13 minor plus; don't worry about it.  It's now become,

14 well, it's a contextualized part of the PAS, which is

15 part of the PAI, and we can discretionarily jack that up

16 any way we want.

17             But all those other factors that they

18 claim 

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think your brief

20 admitted that this isn't in favor of any particular

21 race, that white people in some situations can show

22 leadership, as  as well as black or Hispanic or Asian

23 or Native American.  Any race could benefit from this

24 plus factor.  So how is this 

25             MR. REIN:  I  I 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   worse than Bakke?

9

2             MR. REIN:  With respect, we did not concede

3 that, and we would not concede it because the other PAI

4 factors might benefit anybody of any race.  People's

5 circumstances, their leadership, their community

6 efforts  those are universal, and they can benefit any

7 candidate.  But they don't benefit from the race factor.

8 The race factor was designed to benefit 

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But in Grutter  in both

10 Grutter and what Justice Powell said would be proper in

11 Bakke, race was a factor.  Race, itself, was a factor.

12 And that's why I'm finding it very hard to distinguish

13 what the university is doing, apart from the 10 percent

14 plan.

15             But let  let me ask you about the 10

16 percent plan itself, because it seems to me that that is

17 so obviously driven by one thing only, and that thing is

18 race.  It's totally dependent upon having racially

19 segregated neighborhoods, racially segregated schools,

20 and it operates as a disincentive for a minority student

21 to step out of that segregated community and attempt to

22 get an integrated education.

23             MR. REIN:  Justice Ginsburg, let  let me

24 respond to this, with respect, this  this way.  The

25 Top 10 Plan does not classify anybody by race.  It

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 addresses only standing within the Texas educational

10

2 system.

3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it could work only in

4 the background.

5             MR. REIN:  When you say "work," it works on

6 a number of fronts.  It creates geographic diversity.

7 It looks all over Texas.  It doesn't distinguish between

8 high schools.  It creates socioeconomic diversity.  It

9 does have an effect, a demonstrated effect on race

10 because a number of minorities, the type they care

11 about, are admitted under the top 10 program.  But it's

12 not based on race.  It's based on the degree of effort

13 you make relative to the other people with whom you're

14 being integrated 

15             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It is created because of

16 race.

17             MR. REIN:  I  I'm not in a position to

18 tell you why it was created.  It  it was created 

19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there any doubt that

20 it was created to increase the number of minority

21 students?  Was there any other reason for the 10 percent

22 plan?

23             MR. REIN:  Well, I've given you other

24 reasons, which are it's a  it's kind of a democratic

25 recognition that you want to invite people from all over

11 1 Texas, regardless of the school they went to.  You're 2 looking for those who are trying the hardest, who are 3 doing the best, who excel in their environment. 4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It was recreated in the 5 wake of Hopwood. 6             MR. REIN:  That  that timing, yes. 7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So I think that was the 8 purpose, to define a neutral framework within which to 9 satisfy the States and the universities' objectives. 10             MR. REIN:  And certainly one in the 11 legislature might have looked at the predictable effect, 12 but that purpose and effect are different.  But yes, it 13 was created, and in part, because certain schools do 14 have minorities, the idea was, well, that would benefit 15 those schools just as it would benefit a rural high 16 school in a white community, which ordinarily would have 17 very great difficulty placing its students in the 18 University of Texas.  This system  19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You argue that the 20 University of Texas' goals and  or announced goals are 21 insufficiently concrete. 22             Can you give an example of what, in your 23 view, would be a sufficiently concrete criterion or set 24 of criteria to achieve diversity? 25             MR. REIN:  Well, and  and certainly, the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
12 1 Solicitor General's attempted to do so by breaking down 2 the abstract goals into concrete objectives.  One goal 3 that certainly Grutter respects is, if you have studied 4 your campus and you believe there's an inadequate 5 exchange of views, and the minorities feel so isolated 6 they cannot properly bring to bear their perspective on 7 the campus, you can look at measures of how successful 8 are we in this kind of dialogue and try to investigate 9 that, and try to say, okay, is there a level  you 10 know, when do we reach a level of critical mass, which 11 is the term in Grutter, where that exchange is vibrant 12 and is taking place on our campus.  That's one measure. 13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but I don't 14 understand. 15             How do you do that? 16             MR. REIN:  It's not easy to do, and it's not 17 our job to do it.  I mean, we're not here to tell them 18 how to do it, but your  if one wanted to endeavor to 19 try to find this kind of concrete level, we're not 20 saying quota, but we are saying you have to  you, the 21 university, if you want to use this forbidden tool, this 22 odious classification, you've got to find a way to do 23 it.  You've got to be able to explain what your concrete 24 objective is.  Why  25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are there any critical mass
Alderson Reporting Company

1 studies that you can refer to?  I mean, are there 

13

2             MR. REIN:  None that I know about.

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:   scientific studies where

4 you know at what point you suddenly have enough of a

5 mass?

6             MR. REIN:  No.  And 

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So what did the university

8 base it on?

9             MR. REIN:  The university based it on two

10 things.  It was short of the demographics of the high

11 school graduating class, which is measurable but not

12 legitimate, and it claimed that it was basing it on this

13 classroom, smallclass study which they had conducted

14 previously, which indicated that minorities were not

15 present to the  their satisfaction in a lot of small

16 classes.  That 

17             JUSTICE BREYER:  Seven year  sorry.

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.

19             To their satisfaction.  I'm asking:  On what

20 do they base their satisfaction?  On what do they base?

21 Like, 15 percent, 20 percent?

22             MR. REIN:  They premised it on good faith,

23 and that was accepted in the Fifth Circuit on the first

24 iteration of this case, and this Court said good faith

25 does not suffice.  So 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I thought 2 that the study they did showed that in 1996, they had 3 more participation in these smaller classes.  I don't 4 know if they're really small when they're somewhere 5 between eight and 25 people.  That was a  but there 6 were more of those classes in 1996 than in 2003 or '2 7 when they were looking at that study. 8             It would seem to me that that suggests that 9 there's less  what they took from it, that there's 10 less exchange of ideas in a classroom rather than more, 11 based on this raceneutral policy. 12             MR. REIN:  Well, I think  13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's wrong  since 14 you have to infer these things, you can't use a quota. 15             MR. REIN:  Let me  16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're saying we 17 can't  they can't use demographics.  So they use a 18 study that shows there's less classes.  There's less 19 people in classes.  They talk to administrators, 20 faculty, and students.  They're having racial incidents 21 on campus where students of color are complaining that 22 they feel isolated, that stereotyping is going on, on 23 campus. 24             What more do they need? 25             MR. REIN:  Let me start with your first
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 concern, which is this classroom study.

15

2             First thing I would observe about that if I

3 were in their position, and I'm not, is that the second

4 study was done at a time when there were more minorities

5 admitted than the first study, and they claimed it went

6 backwards.  So that might tell me right away that the

7 problem  the necessity for using race could not be

8 demonstrated for that, because when you 

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  Because the  the

10 necessity is not the necessity you're talking about.

11 It's the  as I read it.  I mean, you use words like

12 "critical mass" and so forth.  It sounds like a cloud of

13 sort of you don't know what they're talking, but as I

14 read further into it, it becomes quite specific, that

15 is, 75 percent of the students are at this university

16 because they were in the top 10 percent of their class.

17 And it doesn't take long before students and faculty in

18 particular situations know who is who.  25 percent of

19 the students in that class are admitted; they're good

20 students, not in the top 10 percent on the basis of

21 leadership, activities, awards, work experience,

22 community service, family's economic status, school

23 status, family responsibilities, singleparent home,

24 languages other than English spoken at home, SAT score

25 relative to school's average and race occasionally, too.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Okay?  We're talking about that 25 percent.  And it

16

2 won't take long before students in a class see that in

3 that 25 percent, which means you aren't just in the top

4 10 percent of your class, in that 25 percent there is

5 hardly anybody who is AfricanAmerican or Hispanic.  And

6 the  and seven years of experience with that kind of

7 thing led the faculty at meetings, administrators, and

8 others to say, we should do more to see that that 25

9 percent has occasionally somebody who is a minority.

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does anybody but the

11 faculty 

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what their program

13 is.  It isn't something like critical mass, et cetera.

14 And  and  and if you have to say, it seems to me,

15 why is that not a diversityrelated judgment of what is

16 necessary?

17             MR. REIN:  So, Justice Breyer, let me answer

18 that.

19             First of all, one thing your question

20 establishes quite clearly is if one assumes premises

21 from evidence that doesn't exist, you can draw

22 conclusions that are perhaps invalid.

23             So let me go back to  to where you

24 started.  You say these people are admitted on the basis

25 of the various PAI factors, which you read.  That's not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 how they're admitted.  That PAI is only part of the

17

2 admissions criteria.

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well 

4             MR. REIN:  And it's not truly holistic

5 because in the holistic systems, you look at the person

6 as a whole.  Here you could have the most wonderful PAI

7 and never come close to admission, because they use the

8 AI independently.  So they're not admitted 

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  Every school is like that.

10 Every school in the country that's a college that I've

11 ever experienced is a combination of grades, class

12 position, and a lot of other things.

13             MR. REIN:  But 

14             JUSTICE BREYER:  So I'm talking about people

15 who aren't admitted; 75 percent are, solely on the basis

16 of class ranking.

17             MR. REIN:  Yeah.  And  and then you assume

18 that people could identify them one from another.

19 They're 

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I was going to ask that.

21             Does anybody, except the faculty, know who

22 this elite 25 percent is?

23             MR. REIN:  No.

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And all of the 10 percent

25 people identified themselves?

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  They go around in bunches,

3 hey, I'm one of the 10 percent?

4             MR. REIN:  They don't, and 

5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  They don't know who the 10

6 percent are, do they?

7             MR. REIN:   and the level of admission to

8 the faculty at the university subgroup in which they

9 study, whether it's business or communications, there

10 it's all done by AI/PAI.  They're all

12             MR. REIN:  They're all done equally.

13             JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I come back to the

14 issue of classroom diversity?  Because that does seem to

15 me to be something that could be measured.  And maybe

16 there's evidence in the record that measures it.  I

17 don't know.  So that's what I want to ask you.  But the

18 University knows which students, even if  assuming

19 that the students don't know, this University knows

20 which students were admitted because they were in the

21 top 10 percent and which were not.

22             And presumably they have a record of all of

23 the classes and which students enrolled in which

24 classes.  And so it would seem to me to be possible to

25 determine whether the students who were admitted under

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
19 1 the 10 percent plan were less likely to choose to enroll 2 in the classes in which minorities are underrepresented 3 than the students who were admitted under holistic 4 review.  Now, maybe that's in the record.  I haven't 5 found it.  Is there anything in the record to show that? 6             MR. REIN:  The best of the record, because 7 they didn't study that specifically.  When they did the 8 classroom study, they  they did not try to distinguish 9 who was in the class.  It was just a number count by  10 by classification, how many minorities of this kind, how 11 many of that kind.  They counted AfricanAmericans. 12 They counted Hispanic students, or  and they counted 13 Asians in that study, but they counted them by race. 14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't want  I don't 15 want to predemit this line of questioning because I 16 think it's important and we're well into the substantive 17 issues. 18             May I begin with almost a procedural point: 19 Did you object to the University's request that this 20 case be remanded to the district court? 21             MR. REIN:  We did in  in the Fifth 22 Circuit. 23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In the Fifth Circuit. 24             It does seem to me, as Justice Alito's 25 question, and frankly some of the other questions have
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
20 1 indicated, that the litigants, and frankly this Court, 2 have been denied the advantage and the perspective that 3 would be gained if there would be additional 4 factfinding under the instructions that Fisher sought 5 to give.  And that just  we're just arguing the same 6 case. 7             MR. REIN:  Well  8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's as if nothing had 9 happened. 10             MR. REIN:  And  and the reason for that  11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I  it seems to me 12 that Justice Alito's question indicates that this is the 13 kind of thing that we should know but we don't know. 14             MR. REIN:  Well, let  let me point out 15 that the  the purpose of strict scrutiny is not just 16 to adjudicate.  It is to instruct the University that 17 before you use the odious classification, before you 18 employ race, you ought to know these things.  If you're 19 going to depend on them, you ought to study them and 20 know them.  So the failure to do that so there is no 21 evidence is not just because they didn't put it in  22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But they weren't given the 23 chance to add additional evidence in order to meet that 24 standard. 25             MR. REIN:  Well, they can't go back and
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
21 1 recreate the past.  They can't  they have put in all 2 the evidence available to them about  3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But they could answer some 4 of the questions as  like the ones Justice Alito 5 added.  And I think it's a very important point. 6             MR. REIN:  They could  I mean, but they'd 7 have to go back and study the conditions at the time 8 they made the decision.  And I think that the failure to 9 do that kind of thing indicates that the retreat to race 10 was reflexive; was done on the day Grutter came down. 11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not only that.  Also the 12 failure to put it in.  It was their burden to put it in, 13 wasn't it? 14             MR. REIN:  Yes.  And they knew that  15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So we're going to say, oh, 16 they failed to put it in.  Let's give them another 17 chance. 18             MR. REIN:  Well, procedurally  19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's do a doover. 20             MR. REIN:  They  21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Send it back down so they 22 can now put in what they should have put in in order to 23 prevail the first time around. 24             MR. REIN:  And that I  I entirely agree 25 with that.  And in  in fairness, they knew that the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 standard was strict scrutiny.  Grutter had said strict 2 scrutiny.  Bakke said strict scrutiny.  It was no 3 surprise. 4             And Justice Alito, more directly, the 5 evidence we did find in the record indicated that where 6 the most selective schools were concerned, which would 7 then lead you to the smaller classes, more of the top 8 ten minorities enrolled in that than the added 9 minorities that they derived  10             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the issue in this case 11 is not whether the University can have holistic review. 12             MR. REIN:  Correct. 13             JUSTICE ALITO:  The issue is whether they 14 can have as a component of holistic review after they 15 have taken into account other characteristics that are 16 not dependent on race; they can add race as an 17 additional characteristic. 18             And so if it were  is there  would there 19 be any way of determining, if there were a remand, which 20 of the nontop 10 admittees were admitted solely because 21 of race?  In other words, these students would not have 22 been admitted taking into account leadership and family, 23 education and socioeconomic background and hardship and 24 everything else. 25             MR. REIN:  According to the University of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
23 1 Texas, the answer to that is no.  They cannot make that 2 determination because, in their view, race is 3 contextual.  You cannot sort out those who could have 4 made it without race from those who didn't. 5             And  and just in response to Justice 6 Breyer, as fact of record, prior to the invocation of 7 race, 15 percent of the nontop 10 admits were  were 8 the minorities who later benefitted from race. 9             So it was not devoid of admits who were 10 Hispanic or  or AfricanAmerican.  It was producing 15 11 percent, a marginal increase out of race was, if you try 12 to measure it, very small.  And  and I could think of 13 reasons for that, but  so they couldn't put that in. 14 They denied that you could ever identify those students. 15 So that would be a fruitless pursuit unless they 16 completely change everything they said before. 17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  May I ask  18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could you associate 19 a number with "the very small"?  I guess it would be the 20 number of students who were admitted with the 21 consideration of race who were not also  22             MR. REIN:  Correct. 23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah. 24             MR. REIN:  That would be the measurement. 25 And  and there's no perfect answer to that when the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
24 1 University says they can't identify them.  But what we 2 did is we looked at the historic period in which they 3 were using the PAI, without reference to race, and 4 compared that to the percentage admitted of the total 5 student body of those admits in the period when they 6 were using race, and they compare  this is about a two 7 and a half percent difference, so it's very small.  And 8 you would  9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Two and a half 10 percent difference in entering class numbers or number 11 of minorities admitted? 12             MR. REIN:  Number of minorities.  You can 13 measure it either way by enrollment or admission.  It's 14 still going to be a very small number.  It doesn't 15 make  it's statistically lost.  So it's a very small 16 increment.  And of course, you  17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The number is 18 important to me.  Is it  is what any  19             MR. REIN:  It's under 3  20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I can ask your 21 friend on the other side, but  22             MR. REIN:  It's under 3 percent. 23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Of what?  Of numbers 24  25             MR. REIN:  Of total admits or the  and the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
25 1 total enrollees both.  And Judge Garza actually premised 2 it. 3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of the minority students. 4 Of blacks in that  5             MR. REIN:  Of the class itself.  So what 6 percentage of  yes.  Let me be very clear.  What 7 you're trying to measure is to what extent did the use 8 of race boost over the use of the PAI on a nonracial 9 basis. 10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I thought 11 you said  12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But in Parents  in 13 Parents Involved, you indicated that at some point the 14 actual benefit of the program turns out to be not really 15 worth the very difficult decision to allow race to be 16 considered if at the end of the day it generates a 17 certain number.  And I'm trying to figure out what that 18 number is. 19             MR. REIN:  And  and I am saying that, as 20 we said in our briefs, and we tried to  there's no 21 perfect measurement because you don't have them running 22 simultaneously. 23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  Right. 24             MR. REIN:  But if you tried to do it by 25 looking at the results when using the PAI, but not race,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
26 1 versus the results both at the admission and enrollment 2 stage of using the PAI affected by race, it's a  it's 3 under 3 percent.  And it's again  4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I'm not sure 5 where you get that number.  As I look at it, between 6 2004 and 2006  '7, it nearly doubled from 3.6 of the 7 holistic class to 6.8.  For Hispanic students  that's 8 for blacks  it went from 11.6 to 16.9.  I don't think 9 that's  that small a change. 10             In 2008, two  20 percent of all black 11 students and 15 percent of all Hispanic students were 12 offered admission through holistic review.  Black and 13 Hispanic admission and enrollment rates have increased 14 since 2005.  This is on  on holistic review.  The only 15 exception was 2008, and that was because 92 percent of 16 the class came in under the 10 percent plan. 17             MR. REIN:  Well, you know  18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  When your number  19             MR. REIN:   when you  when you use 20 numbers about  21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   that's not small. 22             MR. REIN:   admission on holistic review, 23 that incorporates the ones who would have made it 24 without race, so it's not a valid comparative number. 25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The ones who would
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  the ones who would have made it 

27

2             MR. REIN:   without race are incorporated

3 in, quote, "holistic review."  So those numbers really

4 don't tell you anything about the effect of race.  They

5 don't 

6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, wait a minute.  I

7 don't understand how that can be.  If the 2004 number

8 was that much lower than the 2007 number, race has to

9 have some input in that fact  in that 

10             MR. REIN:  It  it has some effect.  That's

11 what UT says.  They haven't measured, and say they can't

12 measure the effect.  You're dealing with different

13 classes.

14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I ask you a

15 different question now?  I fear something.  I know there

16 is an educational debate on the benefits and costs of a

17 10 percent plan.  I don't want to get into that debate,

18 but I do have a worry, which is:  If you're reading

19 proof of a compelling need, or proof of a compelling

20 need, will any holistic review ever survive?

21             Because as I'm reading your answer, to

22 narrowly tailor, schools have to use nonracial means of

23 doing it.  And if the 10 percent plan is the only thing

24 that achieves a greater number in minorities, won't

25 every school have to use a 10 percent plan?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
28 1             MR. REIN:  We're not, certainly, trying to 2 dictate that every school use a 10 percent plan, nor is 3 it the only way in which you can encourage and increase 4 minority enrollment.  So I  I don't accept that 5 premise. 6             Strict scrutiny is a  a heavy burden.  And 7 the purpose of strict scrutiny as to recognize that the 8 base  9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So your answer is yes. 10 If there's no other  11             MR. REIN:  No.  I  12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   way of doing it, then 13 the only other raceneutral way  if offering 14 scholarships, which this university did, increasing 15 outreach to minority neighborhoods, they did and 16 continue to do  there's a list of about six or eight 17 other things they did that didn't increase the admission 18 of minorities. 19             MR. REIN:  There are many other things they 20 could do.  We're not trying to tell them how to run it. 21 I mean, clearly one of the things they could do is  22 even in the PAI, they recognize that by emphasizing, as 23 they did at first, the two essay scores, which are 24 strictly composition, grammar, that  that is as 25 culturally biased as you can get it.  It  it makes it
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 difficult for those who have gone through an inferior 2 secondary program to excel. 3             So they cut that score to three.  They could 4 cut it to two.  They could  they could take measures 5 which were aimed at looking at potential deficiencies in 6 initial education because you come from a home where 7 there isn't a collegeeducated person and say, we're 8 going to take those further into account because they 9 apply equally without regard to race. 10             So there are many things they could do 11 with  12             JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but that's exactly the 13 question, I think.  I would  I can put the same 14 question  or suppose we do send it back to the 15 district court and, put in more evidence, we tell them. 16 Suppose we did that.  And suppose they start with the 17 basic plan where we want to use race is in the 18 25 percent of the holistic area.  We want to do that. 19             Now, they're using the chart  and I've 20 seen the chart  of the factors that are one, two, 21 three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, 22 twelve.  You know, using that chart.  I've seen the 23 chart.  And at the bottom of the chart in my list is the 24 word "race."  It says "race," race. 25             Okay?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             What kind of evidence, in your opinion,

30

2 could they or anyone else with any roughly similar plan

3 put in that would show, in your view, that this is

4 constitutional?

5             MR. REIN:  Well, I mean, you have the

6 example of Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke.  And that

7 says that if you're looking at the whole person and

8 you're comparing individuals one to another to say who

9 will best suit the educational need of the class, then

10 you take account of a person's race.  It's part of

11 the  the exercise.

12             You don't isolate it, because if you look at

13 Justice Bakke's example, he's got A and B, two minority

14 AfricanAmerican students, and C.  And he says,

15 depending where the class stands in the overall

16 composition of this learning entity, you might choose A

17 under one circumstance; vice versa, you might choose B;

18 and sometimes you'll choose C without regard to race.

19 So he's looking at it as a way of looking at the

20 totality of a person, all of their achievements,

21 academic and otherwise.

22             So you  so Bakke's systems are not at

23 issue here, nor is the top 10 at issue.  That's  that

24 was accepted in this case.  No one challenged it.

25             So I'm saying you don't have to do the top

Alderson Reporting Company

1 10.  You can

31

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So we have one.

3 But I'm looking 

4             MR. REIN:  Justice Breyer, you can achieve

5 this small increment of under 3 percent, in our view, by

6 a number of alternatives that would  would  would

7 give this same boost.  These are the race  racially

8 alternative neutral alternatives.

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  I have one.  I have one.

10             MR. REIN:  But not 

11             JUSTICE BREYER:  What you're saying is you

12 should look at the two folders, and as a kind of

13 tiebreaker, use race.  That, to you, is okay.

14             Now, is there  you said there is several

15 others?  It would be helpful if you  if you can

16 summarize them in a sentence, so I get an idea of what

17 the others are.

18             MR. REIN:  You could  you could give more

19 emphasis to the socioeconomic factors in the school.

20             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's not to use race.

21 I'm saying race, race.  I want to know which are the

22 things they could do that, in your view, would be okay.

23 Because I'm really trying to find out.  Not fatal in

24 fact, we've said.  Okay?  Not fatal in fact.  Fine.

25             What are the things, in your view, that they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 could do so it is not fatal in fact?

32

2             MR. REIN:  And what I've said first is they

3 could shape their system more toward the Bakke system,

4 and move toward individualized consideration.  That's

5 one thing.  That's not fatal in fact, because this Court

6 endorsed the  the view that Justice Powell took of the

7 Harvard system in Bakke.  So that's one.

8             They could expand the top 10.  That's

9 another alternative.  That's  that's available.

10             They could  as I said, they could rescore

11 some of this 

12             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the top 10, you said

13 it doesn't use race.  Justice Breyer is asking, you say

14 yes, race can be a factor.  It was a factor in Bakke.

15 It was a factor in Grutter.  And so far, you're saying

16 that now it can be a factor only if what?

17             I mean, we're not talking about socalled

18 neutral factors.  We're talking about 

19             MR. REIN:  Well, I mean, the first question

20 is, you know, why are you using it?  The why.

21 Therefore, it can be a factor.  You have to clarify the

22 objective, you have to show the necessity, and you have

23 to show that, if you, as  as they do, live with and

24 accept, over time, a very small increment in a very

25 small segment of the class, that you can't get it done

Alderson Reporting Company

1 any other way.

Official

33

2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I 

3             MR. REIN:  Because race is not the baseline.

4 It's an odious classification.  That's where we differ.

5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  As I understand what you're

6 saying, the Bakke approach  comparing two individuals

7 and  and  and, where they're tied, giving a  a

8 benefit to one for race  that's okay.  Regardless of

9 whether there are any other means 

10             MR. REIN:  No 

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:   of achieving the  the

12 racial balance that you're looking for.  Right?

13             MR. REIN:  Well, Justice Powell indicated in

14 Bakke that that approach could be used where it's part

15 of a greater function form in the class.

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Understand.  Understand.

17 But 

18             MR. REIN:  And that  and the Court has 

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you  you don't 

20             MR. REIN:   apparently accepted.  We're

21 not challenging it here.

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't have to apply the

23 question whether it could possibly be done in any other

24 way.  But you're saying anything beyond that, anything

25 else, you have to establish first that it couldn't be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
34 1 done another way that doesn't take into account race, 2 such as expanding the 10  top 10 percent to the top 3 15 percent. 4             MR. REIN:  That is correct. 5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right? 6             MR. REIN:  And it's not just me, 7 Justice Scalia.  That's what this Court said in the 8 prior opinion. 9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what I thought. 10             MR. REIN:  They had  it has to be shown to 11 be necessary. 12             And of course, that's true of all strict 13 scrutiny.  And the Court said in the prior opinion that 14 it's other strict scrutiny opinions, such as Adarand, 15 were applicable here.  This is not detached.  It's not 16 different. 17             Strict scrutiny is a heavy burden.  There's 18 no question about it.  That's why it's strict scrutiny. 19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is there any evidence that 20 the holistic review being used by UT operates as a 21 quota? 22             MR. REIN:  I  you know, I'm  we have not 23 claimed that, but since so much of it is masked and 24 hidden  but  but if  certainly if you're 25 motivated, as they said, by demographics, they want to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 get the number up, it's certainly numberdriven.

35

2             And if you look at  one thing this Court

3 said in Grutter, you have to have a basis to review

4 this, because you would like to make it end.  There has

5 to be an end point.  So in  if you can't find your

6 objectives, you have no endpoint.

7             But more important, you look at what are

8 they looking at.  What are they measuring each year?

9 And they're measuring numbers.  They want those numbers

10 to go up.  That's what they care about.  That's what

11 this system does.

12             So whether it's a quota in the strict sense,

13 to wit, we have a  a definite target, their target may

14 be equating with the population  the high school

15 population.  I mean, today they're a majorityminority

16 campus, the real world.  They've  they've

17 gone because  just because of the  the  the

18 demographics of high school.

19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Rein, because your

20 time is running out, there is one preliminary question

21 I'd like you to address, and that is:  What is the

22 relief you're seeking?  I take it not injunctive,

23 because Ms. Fisher has graduated.

24             MR. REIN:  Correct.

25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you have no class.

Alderson Reporting Company

36 1 So what  what specific relief are you seeking in this 2 case? 3             MR. REIN:  This case started with a plea for 4 damages.  The damages plea is live.  It has never been 5 challenged. 6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what do the damages 7 consist of? 8             MR. REIN:  They were  the damages 9 consisted of a  a refund of the unjustlycommitted fee 10 for application.  That was the direct  one specified 11 application.  We also asked for other just and further 12 relief, because at that point of the case, we didn't 13 know anything for certain; to wit, if she was admitted, 14 it would be one thing.  If she wasn't  weren't 15 admitted, there would be other damages arising from her 16 failure to be admitted.  And we realized that was a 17 separate issue.  We reserved on it.  We  we've  18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If the  if the 19 university should say, okay, the application fee and 20 whatever else we add to that, we  we offer that so 21 that this contest will be over; if they offered you the 22 damages that you are seeking, would the case become 23 moot? 24             MR. REIN:  No.  And the reason is the 25 damages we are seeking were broader than that.  That was
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the specific item of damage that was pleaded.  They

37

2 didn't challenge it under 12(b)(6).

3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What are 

4             MR. REIN:  They answered 

5             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   what are the broad 

6 what are the broader?  You gave me the application fee.

7             MR. REIN:  Well, now, Ms. Fisher has not

8 been admitted, and that she has suffered the

9 consequences of nonadmission, which include she went to

10 an alternative university; she had to travel as opposed

11 to being in her home State.  There is certainly good

12 information that within the State of Texas, a degree

13 from the University of Texas has consequences and

14 earnings down the road, and that's measurable.  And she

15 doesn't have that benefit.

16             All of those elements, which were not part

17 of the case originally, because we were trying to enjoin

18 in a way that would have her admitted, now she's not

19 admitted.  That changes the complexion of the case.

20             That's why we bifurcated  that's why we

21 reserved the right to amend within our broader plea for

22 all other just and relief.

23             So in terms of just standing, we have an

24 existing claim.  They haven't paid us.  They threatened

25 to do that on the first Petition for Cert.  They never

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 did it.  They didn't tender it.  We have an existing

38

2 claim.  We have broader claims that are inchoate,

3 because we haven't yet reached the stage of litigating

4 remedy and damages.  So the case continues.  There is

5 standing  unquestioned standing in this case.

6             Thank you, Your Honor.

7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose  I

8 suppose if they tender it, you don't have to accept it

9 either, right?

10             MR. REIN:  Correct.

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.

12             MR. REIN:  I'll reserve the rest of my time.

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Garre.

14             ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

15               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

16             MR. GARRE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

17 and may it please the Court:

18             To pick up on the questions this morning,

19 I'd like to focus on three things.  One, why the record

20 supports the Texas legislature's conclusion in 2009 that

21 the holistic plan at issue was a necessary complement to

22 the State's Top 10 Percent Law; two, why the record

23 shows that Texas's holistic policy has had a meaningful

24 impact on diversity at the University of Texas; and,

25 three, why the record absolutely forecloses any claim

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that University of Texas has adopted a quota.

39

2             With respect to the first question of

3 necessity, there are three principle ways in which the

4 record shows that the plan at issue was a necessary

5 complement.  First, as Justice Breyer mentioned, there

6 is a significant portion of the admissions pool, all

7 outofState students, all students from Texas high

8 schools that don't rank, some of the best high schools

9 in the State, and all students just below the top 10

10 percent who are nevertheless great students who aren't

11 eligible for admission under the top 10 percent at all.

12 And the Fifth Circuit found that without the

13 consideration of race in the mix for those students,

14 admissions would approach an all white enterprise.

15             Secondly, the record in this case shows 

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  Just the

17 admissions of people beyond the top 10 percent?

18             MR. GARRE:  That's right, which is an

19 important component of the class, Your Honor.

20             Second, and I think this goes to your point,

21 Justice 

22             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, on that point, can you

23 determine which of the holistic admittees would not have

24 been admitted if race was not added to the  to the

25 determination?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. GARRE:  Okay.  This goes to the

40

2 meaningful impact point, and I think there are several

3 ways to address it, Justice Alito.

4             First, what you can do is you can look in

5 the increase in AfricanAmerican and Hispanic holistic

6 admissions after the consideration of race was added.

7 And what you find is, is that in each year, 2005, 2006,

8 2007, the percentage of AfricanAmerican and Hispanics

9 admitted and enrolled under the holistic plan grew.  In

10 fact, there was a 70 percent 

11             JUSTICE ALITO:  That's not really my

12 question.  My question was if you look at an individual

13 person, can you tell whether that person was admitted

14 because  solely because of race?  Whether that person

15 would not have been admitted were it not for the fact

16 that the person was an AfricanAmerican or Hispanic?

17             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, I think, given the

18 contextualized and individualized nature of that

19 inquiry, that's going to be difficult.  But I think the

20 record nevertheless answers your question because you

21 can show a marked increase in diversity under the plan

22 at issue.  I just  I've just explained to you how the

23 record confirms that holistic admissions of

24 AfricanAmericans and Hispanics increased markedly in

25 each year.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             If you look at student body diversity

41

2 overall, AfricanAmerican enrollment increased by two,

3 doubled from 2002 to 2008 from about 3 percent to about

4 6 percent.

5             JUSTICE ALITO:  What  one of the things I

6 find troubling about your argument is the suggestion

7 that there is something deficient about the

8 AfricanAmerican students and the Hispanic students who

9 are admitted under the top 10 percent plan.  They're not

10 dynamic.  They're not leaders.  They're not change

11 agents.  And I don't know what the basis for that is.

12             MR. GARRE:  Okay.

13             JUSTICE ALITO:  It's  really it's based on

14 a terrible stereotyping that 

15             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, it's 

16             JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the basis for

17 that 

18             MR. GARRE:  It's exactly the opposite.  This

19 Court has said time and again that you can't assume that

20 minorities think alike just because they have the same

21 skin color.  What the University of Texas does is it

22 considers  it takes into account the fact that people

23 who come from different experiences, different

24 backgrounds are going to have different contributions to

25 the class.  If you had the situation where all the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
42 1 outofState admits or most of the outofState admits 2 were coming predominantly from western States, then the 3 University of Texas and any university would try to get 4 outofState admits from other parts of the country 5 because it would want the  both perspectives. 6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But  maybe I 7 misapprehended either the question or the answer.  But 8 you're the one that says race can be relevant.  And then 9 in answer to Justice Alito's question, you say, oh, 10 that's stereotyping.  It seems to me that you're 11 inconsistent. 12             MR. GARRE:  No.  What stereotyping, Your 13 Honor, is saying, that just because you get a sufficient 14 number of blacks or Hispanics under the 10 percent plan 15 means that you can't look at the class holistically and 16 say, we're not getting a variety of perspectives among 17 AfricanAmericans or Hispanics. 18             JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  But what is the basis 19 for saying that?  That's what I don't understand.  It's 20 kind of the assumption that if the  if a student  if 21 a black student or a Hispanic student is admitted as 22 part of the top 10 percent plan, it has to be because 23 that student didn't have to compete against very many 24 whites and  and Asians.  In  in the high school 25 class, it's a really pernicious stereotype.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
43 1             MR. GARRE:  It's  it's not a stereotype at 2 all, Your Honor.  It's based on the undeniable fact 3 about the manner in which the top 10 percent plan 4 operates.  The Top 10 Percent Law was enacted in 5 response to Hopwood, and there's nothing  there's no 6 challenge to the law in this case that admits many 7 welldeserving students.  But the fact is, is that  8 that the way that the Top 10 Percent Law admits minority 9 students is by admitting those students from the 10 lowerperforming, racially identifiable schools. 11             And the way  the reason we know that is 12 because if you look at the bill analysis decided by 13 Justice Ginsburg in her dissent the last time we were 14 here, that analysis specifically says on page 4, 15 "Because of the persistence of segregation in this 16 State, minority students will be admitted under the top 17 10 percent plan." 18             JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't doubt that that is 19 one of the things that it does, and I would have thought 20 that that would be something that you would regard as 21 beneficial. 22             MR. GARRE:  We  23             JUSTICE ALITO:  Wasn't that the  the 24 reason for adopting affirmative action in the first 25 place because there are people who have been severely
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
44 1 disadvantaged through discrimination and  and lack of 2 wealth, and they should be given a benefit in 3 admission  4             MR. GARRE:  And the University  5             JUSTICE ALITO:   but that's one  one of 6 the things that it does, but it's not the only thing 7 that it does. 8             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, the University of 9 Texas applauds those students.  It wants those students. 10 Those students are admitted through holistic review as 11 well.  Nevertheless, the University can look at an 12 incoming class and determine that not all the 13 perspectives among a particular class of students is 14 being represented.  This is straight out of the Harvard 15 plan in Bakke  16             JUSTICE ALITO:  This is a statistic that 17 jumped out at me, which it seems to me contrary to the 18 stereotype on which the Fifth Circuit panel proceeds and 19 on which you proceed.  Of the AfricanAmerican and 20 Hispanic students who were admitted under the top 10 21 percent plan, 21 percent had parents who had either a 22 bachelor's degree or a fouryear degree.  And for the 23 holistic admittees, AfricanAmericans and Hispanics, 24 it's 26 percent.  This is from a Class of 2008. 25             So there isn't  it seems to me it refutes
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 the idea that all of these minority students who were 2 admitted under  or most of them admitted under the 3 10 percent plan come just from these predominantly 4 overwhelmingly black and Hispanic schools with poor 5 students.  It's just  it doesn't seem to be true. 6             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, we've never claimed 7 that all of them do.  That's a straw man argument.  But 8 if you look at the data, what you would find, in 9 particular look at the 2008 profile that we cited in our 10 last brief on page 33, you do find that on balance, 11 there is a difference in background of the students, 12 AfricanAmerican, Hispanic students, coming in through 13 the holistic plan versus the top 10 percent plan.  And 14 that's no surprise, given the obvious purpose of the top 15 10 percent plan.  The purpose of the holistic review 16 plan is to take into account all considerations. 17             JUSTICE BREYER:  We know that  can you  18 can you say this?  Let me read you two phrases from 19 Fisher I.  The first phrase says this:  "The decision to 20 pursue"  and Fisher I, obviously, put together a court 21 of people who don't agree necessarily on affirmative 22 action.  Generally we agreed on those words. 23             Words 1:  "The decision to pursue the 24 educational benefits that flow from student diversity is 25 in substantial measure an academic judgment to which
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1 some, but not complete, judicial deference is proper." 2             Okay? 3             Now, words No. 2:  The University must 4 provide a, quote, "reasoned, principled explanation for 5 the academic decision to pursue diversity."  Your plan 6 is pursuing diversity among the 25 percent who are not 7 admitted under the Top 10 Plan. 8             Your principled, reasoned explanation for 9 that academic decision is? 10             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, it's set forth in 11 the 2004 proposal which is in the supplemental joint 12 appendix.  It's elaborated by the deposition testimony. 13 Let me give you some  a few pieces of that. 14             Number one is, is the University made clear 15 it was pursuing the educational benefits of diversity in 16 the broad sense specifically recognized by this Court. 17 This is on pages 1 through 3 of the Supplemental Joint 18 Appendix. 19             Number two, the University made clear that 20 in its judgment the top 10 percent plan, in particular 21 as it grew to crowd out the class, was compromising its 22 educational objectives.  That's on page 25a and 31a of 23 the Supplemental Joint Appendix. 24             Number three, the University made clear that 25 because of the decrease in student body diversity under
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
47 1 the very raceneutral policies that our opponents are 2 asking this Court to impose, that additional measures 3 were necessary to make sure that it was achieving its 4 educational objectives. 5             All of that is laid out in far more detail, 6 frankly, than it was in Grutter or that it was in the 7 Harvard plan.  It's amplified by the deposition 8 testimony.  In particular, look at the testimony of 9 Ms. Iship and Mr. Walker.  And I can elaborate that  10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And  11             MR. GARRE:   on that, if you would like. 12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you're talking 13 about the 2004 plan? 14             MR. GARRE:  Yes, Your Honor. 15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Excuse me.  One of 16 the things that it said is that you would review the 17 plan every five years.  Has that happened? 18             MR. GARRE:  It absolutely has.  We  in the 19 record, Your Honor, it's established that we have 20 reviewed it on an annual basis.  We reviewed it on a 21 fiveyear basis.  I was personally involved in part of 22 that. 23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How did you 24 measure  how did you measure whether or not the plan 25 was working 
Alderson Reporting Company

1             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor 

48

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   under the review

3 that you undertook?

4             MR. GARRE:  We would look to a number of

5 different 

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  What did you 

7 what did you look to?

8             MR. GARRE:  And  and I'll answer that

9 question.  We looked  we looked both to student body

10 enrollment.  We do look to classroom diversity.  We look

11 at feedback from students; from faculty  after all,

12 this is an academic judgment, as this Court said in the

13 Fisher case, and certainly said in the Grutter and the

14 Bakke case  we look to  to the racial climate,

15 including incidents.  There's briefs before you in the

16 Black Students Association brief, Latino Organization

17 briefs 

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  It's  it's an

19 academic judgment, but the facts are not an academic

20 judgment.

21             MR. GARRE:  It's  well 

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  To say that, you know, if

23 the faculty thinks we're doing great, we must be doing

24 great.  I mean, the facts are the facts.  I don't think

25 we give the faculty a leg up on  on what the facts

Alderson Reporting Company

1 are.

Official

49

2             MR. GARRE:  And look at the facts, Your

3 Honor.  In 2002, you had 272 AfricanAmerican enrollees

4 out of a class of 8,000.  Even Judge Garza recognized in

5 note 11 of his decision that the University of Texas had

6 not achieved its critical mass or educational benefits

7 in 2004.  So I don't think that that seriously is

8 debatable.  If it is, then we should have a remand and

9 an opportunity to put in more evidence 

10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you're talking

11 about the time  Grutter said that we did not expect

12 these sorts of programs to be around in 25 years, and

13 that was 12  12 years ago.  Are  are we going to hit

14 the deadline?  Is this going to be done on  in your

15 view in 12 years?

16             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, I'm not here to give

17 you a date, but what I would say is this:  There are

18 systematic problems that these problems  that these

19 policies are attempting to address, including the test

20 score gap between  between AfricanAmericans and

21 Hispanics.  And  and the record in this case

22 overwhelmingly shows that without the addition of race,

23 student body diversity suffered, particularly among

24 AfricanAmericans.

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand.  I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 don't know whether that's a yes or no.  But it was

50

2 important in the Grutter court that these were a

3 temporary  as necessary, temporary expedience because

4 we're talking about giving you the extraordinary power

5 to consider race in making important decisions.  And we

6 don't do that as a matter of  matter of 

7             MR. GARRE:  And we  we appreciate the 

8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   course.

9             And so it was important in Grutter to say,

10 look, this can't go on forever, 25 years.  And when do

11 you think your program will be done?

12             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, as soon as we  we

13 can achieve the same  sufficient numbers for the

14 educational benefits of diversity without taking race

15 into account, we will no longer take race into account.

16             The strictscrutiny inquiry focuses on

17 whether or not there are raceneutral alternatives,

18 which I think really is the way to police this.  And in

19 this case, because it's backwardlooking, you look to

20 whether or not the University policies in place for

21 seven years  this is a distinct case.  You have a

22 record of seven years of trying the raceneutral

23 alternatives that they're proposing, top 10 percent,

24 plus raceblind holistic review.  And the record tells

25 you what happened.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
51 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, how  what 2 percentage of the class is  what legacy is that a 3 consideration for? 4             MR. GARRE:  University of Texas does not do 5 legacy, Your Honor. 6             But if you look at what happened  and this 7 is the second reason why it's necessary  it's  it's 8  I don't think it's debatable that student body 9 diversity suffered at the University of Texas under the 10 policies that they're asking this Court to impose.  And 11 in particular under AfricanAmericans where you had 12 evidence of glaring racial isolation, certainly in the 13 classroom where 90 percent of the classes, the most 14 common size, are zero or one AfricanAmerican  15             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, on that subject, I 16 don't know of any  you haven't mentioned in your 17 briefs anything that the University of Texas has done to 18 increase racial diversity at the classroom level, other 19 than this admissions program. 20             And I mentioned during your  your friend's 21 argument a way in which you could determine whether the 22 top 10 admittees are any more or less likely to enroll 23 in classes  small classes where there is a lack of 24 racial diversity than the holistic admittees.  And I 25 don't see  and you haven't made any effort, as far as
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 I can tell, to measure that.

52

2             MR. GARRE:  Let me answer that in two ways.

3 One, doubling the enrollment of AfricanAmerican

4 students, which happened from 2002 to 2008, is going to

5 increase diversity in the classroom.  And we've looked

6 at that, and it has.

7             Secondly, with respect to diversity among

8 particular majors, University does take holistic

9 consideration of where  which schools students are

10 admitted to as well.  So its policy addresses that

11 concern as well.

12             But what the record does show, Your Honor,

13 conclusively, I think, is that diversity languished at

14 the University of Texas in the period where we had

15 raceblind holistic admissions plus the top 10 percent,

16 and that the plan at issue here was necessary to

17 supplement that.  The Texas legislature found that.

18             JUSTICE ALITO:  But I don't  you could

19 have determined whether this is  whether the

20 admission  the addition of race to the holistic

21 equation has done anything to increase classroom

22 diversity.

23             MR. GARRE:  It has.

24             JUSTICE ALITO:  And you haven't done that.

25             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, we've looked at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that, in part, in the fiveyear analysis 

53

2             JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  As  as comparing,

3 this goes back to your  your underlying claim is

4 there's something deficient about the top 10 admittees,

5 and I  maybe  if you have  do you have evidence

6 that they are less likely to  to enroll in the classes

7 where there's a lack of classroom diversity 

8             MR. GARRE:  There's a different breakdown

9 there, Your Honor.  But I think there's two dimensions

10 to this diversity issue.  One is just the glaring racial

11 isolation that existed, particularly among

12 AfricanAmericans.

13             And then two is an effort, through the

14 addition of holistic review, to admit minorities from

15 different viewpoints, experiences, and perspectives.

16 That gets back right to the core of the essence of the

17 diversity embraced by this Court in Bakke.

18             If you look at the Harvard brief in the

21 not be met if all of minority students were  were

22 coming from depressed socioeconomic backgrounds."

23             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I  but that's where

24 I'm looking for evidence that that's true.

25             MR. GARRE:  And I would

54 1             JUSTICE ALITO:  What is it  what is it  2 have you looked at the top 10 percent admittees, for 3 example, to see how many of them are leaders, which is 4 certainly  and certainly a legitimate factor to look 5 for, students who are leaders. 6             At  do you say, well, there are  there 7 are just not very many leaders here; these are students 8 who all they do is study.  There's no evidence of that 9 as far as I can tell. 10             MR. GARRE:  I don't think it's  it's 11 seriously debatable, but if we need evidence on this, 12 let us put it into the record that a class selected by 13 the holistic consideration of numerous factors is going 14 to be more diverse in a way that promotes the 15 University's educational interests than a class selected 16 by a single factor. 17             And let me give you the deposition  18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  That's 19 not  that's not the question.  It's whether students 20 selected under the holistic process without giving extra 21 points because of race. 22             MR. GARRE:  And there's two problems with 23 that.  One, they're not  minority students are not 24 going to be selected.  It's going to become, as the 25 Fifth Circuit found, essentially an allwhite

1 enterprise.  That's the first problem.

55

2             And then the second 

3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Wait.  What are you

4 telling me?  The holistic process, if race is not

5 expressly considered, will not result in any minority

6 students?

7             MR. GARRE:  No.  It's not zero, Your Honor.

8 But take 2002 for example.  272 AfricanAmericans out of

9 a class of 8,000.  That's glaring racial isolation.

10 University of Texas concluded that was unacceptable.

11 And I don't think that that's seriously debatable.

12             But again, if we need more evidence on why

13 having 90 percent of our classrooms of the most common

14 size was zero or one AfricanAmerican doesn't achieve

15 our educational objectives 

16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What  what unique

17  what unique perspective does a minority student bring

18 to a physics class?

19             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor 

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're counting

21 those among the classes in which there are no minority

22 students.  And I'm just wondering what the benefits of

23 diversity are in that situation?

24             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, we can talk about

25 different classes, but  but this Court has  has

56 1 accepted in Bakke and Grutter, and I think it accepted 2 again in Fisher I, that student body diversity is a 3 compelling interest. 4             Our friends do not ask this Court to rule  5 overrule any aspect of Grutter or of Fisher or of 6 Bakke  7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not sure we said it's 8 class by class. 9             MR. GARRE:  And we're not asking  10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not sure we said it's 11 the case class by class. 12             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, that's a caricature 13 of the University's interests here.  We made clear in 14 the 2004 proposal and throughout  15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a caricature of the 16 argument you're making. 17             MR. GARRE:  Student body  classroom 18 diversity, Your Honor, if that's what you're focused on, 19 was one aspect that the University looked to.  I mean, 20 the University is being hit by both sides here.  Maybe 21 that's fair because of the nature of strict scrutiny. 22             But on the one hand, we're going to look to 23 prove the way in which diversity was lacking with 24 diversity.  And then on the other hand, every time we 25 point to something, our opponent seizes on it say,

7             MR. GARRE:  Justice Kennedy, I didn't want

8 to 

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I  I was going to ask:

10 What evidence would you have put in if you had been

11 successful in your motion to remand?

12             And preliminary to that, I assume that

13 district court would have had authority to remand to 

14 to allow the summary judgment record to be expanded or

15 reopened?

16             MR. GARRE:  Well, the court of appeals would

17 have had authority in our view.  The district court 

18 again, this case is on  here on summary judgment.  I

19 mean, the first question is whether the 

20             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I understand 

21             MR. GARRE:   the triable issues at fact 

22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I understand.  But  but

23 I  I  but  but why did you want a remand?  Because

24 you wanted to expand the summary judgment record?  And

25 if so, what additional evidence would you have put in?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. GARRE:  Sure.  If there are any

58

2 shortcomings that this Court sees, certainly what  if

3 they  if you feel that there are deficiencies in

4 looking on a more granular basis between the nature of

5 the holistic admits that are admitted, the unique

6 skills, qualities, talents that those admits bring as

7 change agents and bridge builders, we can put that

8 evidence in.  We can put in additional evidence.

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you  but you asked

10 for the remand 

11             MR. GARRE:  Yes.

12             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   and my question was:

13 What evidence did you propose to put in if your motion

14 had been granted?

15             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, we didn't  we 

16 we  we specifically pointed to evidence on standing,

17 and we talked about that, if the Court would like to

18 supplement the evidence in other respects.  And I  and

19 I think, frankly, we would be entitled to a remand.

20             If you look at the Grutter case, for

21 example, this Court rejected the argument that the

22 percentage plan was an adequate substitute for the

23 holistic consideration of race.  It didn't require

24 evidentiary findings on that.  But if the Court thinks

25 these findings are necessary, then the University of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
59 1 Texas can put in  certainly put in additional evidence 2 in the record showing why these holistic students, 3 selected across the broad diversity recognized by Bakke, 4 contribute meaningfully to the class in this issue. 5             JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't know what that  6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let me  7             JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't know what that 8 proves.  Sure.  I  I'm sure that there are holistic 9 admittees who were great students.  They made a 10 wonderful contribution to the university. 11             I'll  I don't know whether you're going to 12 be able to determine that they would have not  they 13 would not have been admitted if race hadn't been taken 14 into account.  They probably  they would have  many 15 of them would have been.  Maybe all of them.  But beyond 16 that, what is to say that there are not comparable 17 students who were among the top 10 percent admittees?  I 18 bet there are. 19             MR. GARRE:  I  I think certainly you can 20 conclude, Your Honor, that, where you have all 21 outofState students, all students from the best 22 schools in Texas that don't rank, students who fall just 23 below that 10 percent but nevertheless are great 24 students, if we're not getting adequate diversity out of 25 the  that class, special class of students, we're not

5 fundamental problem that I think Justice Alito is

6 pointing to, and you're sort of talking past each other.

7 So maybe I'll explain his view.

8             (Laughter.)

9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Strange, isn't that?

10             JUSTICE ALITO:  I  I could use  I can

11 use the help.

12             (Laughter.)

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think I'll explain

14 what his view is.

15             He seems to think that you didn't study the

16 10 percent admittees enough before  to make  to see

17 whether that group was diverse in and of itself, whether

18 you had enough people within that group that were change

19 agents, that were  had  were not just poor people,

20 but people with collegeeducated parents, whatever other

21 diverse view factors.  He's  I think he's saying, you

22 didn't look to see if the 10 percent plan did enough for

23 you.

24             MR. GARRE:  Right.

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And with deficits that

2 holisticlooking.  So he thinks it's fatally flawed.

3             MR. GARRE:  Right.

4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right?  Because of

5 that.  So that's his view, I think.

6             So assuming that view, what's your answer?

7             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well  well, that's my

8 question.  But 

9             (Laughter.)

10             MR. GARRE:  Well, let me  let me answer

11 that question.

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know.  He said it

13 wasn't, right?

14             MR. GARRE:  First, we did look at that.  We

15 had seven years of experience under the raceblind

16 holistic admissions policy.  And what the university

17 found  this is at page 31 and 25a of the Supplemental

18 Joint Appendix 

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That was with the ten 

20 so seven years 

21             MR. GARRE:  Raceblind 

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Raceblind 

23             MR. GARRE:   raceblind holistic, and up

24 to 10 

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   and a certain number

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 of them were with the 10 percent 

62

2             MR. GARRE:  Absolutely.  And what we found

3 was that, particularly as the top 10 percent plan began

4 to grow and crowd out more of the admissions pool, the

5 university was not meeting its educational objectives.

6 That  that's what it found specifically.  It stated

7 that on page 31a of the Supplemental Joint Appendix.

8             We also knew  and it's interesting:  The

9 Texas legislature found that the holistic plan was a

10 necessary complement.  The Texas district court judge

11 did.  The Texas Court of Appeals judge and his colleague

12 did.  And all  what all of them recognized is the

13 obvious way in which the top 10 percent plan operates

14 with respect to 

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if you did not have 

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's right.  But

17 there's 

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If  if you did not have

19 the top 10 percent plan, but you did have the program

20 that you're advocating for here, the holistic review,

21 would you have a better or worse chance of achieving the

22 diversity you seek?

23             MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, I  I think the

24 first thing I would like to say is that it's a different

25 way.  And I don't mean to dodge the question by that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
63 1             But what I would say is, if  if that's a 2 meaningful difference, then this plan is  is in an 3 even stronger light than the plan in Bakke and the 4 Harvard plan.  Because the University of Texas has 5 heeded this Court's message.  It's taken threequarters 6 of the class that it selects through a facially 7 raceneutral system, the Top 10 Percent Law.  And what 8 we're here debating is whether or not it can complement 9 that policy by taking race into account for a quarter. 10             Now, it may actually be that the university 11 could achieve more diversity through the pure 12 GrutterBakkestyle plan, but we think, working with the 13 Texas legislature, we've come up with a hydrid  hybrid 14 plan that works together to both  to both address this 15 Court's concerns about using race too much in the 16 process, and addressing University of Texas's 17 legitimate, core academic concerns about compiling a 18 class that's diverse in all the ways that are 19 appreciated by Bakke. 20             If I could read one aspect of the deposition 21 testimony here.  This is from Ms. Ishop on page 253a of 22 the Joint Appendix, and she explains why top 10 percent 23 alone is not sufficient. 24             What she says is, quote, "Considering an 25 applicant on the basis of just their test score and
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
64 1 class rank leaves out all of that life experience and 2 circumstantial experience that an applicant faces.  It's 3 also important not  not only to how they developed and 4 the type of student they are, but also to what they 5 contribute to our campus."  That's what the holistic 6 policy adds. 7             If you exclude race from that mix, you not 8 only aren't looking at the individual in all its 9 respects  and race still does matter in Austin and 10 across this country  but you're  you're preventing 11 the university from rounding out its class from 12 complementing the singleminded way that the Top 10 13 Percent Law to achieve its diversity objectives in a way 14 that is narrowly tailored to its interests, which this 15 Court has found compelling. 16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, all of the colloquy 17 so far indicates to me that, if you had a remand, you 18 would not have put in much different or much more 19 evidence than we have in the record right now.  Is 20 that  21             MR. GARRE:  Well  22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   is that correct? 23             MR. GARRE:  No, it's not, Your Honor.  I 24 mean, look, we think that the record is sufficient.  We 25 think that the Fifth Circuit got it right.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
65 1             But  but to be clear, we can certainly put 2 in plenty of additional evidence.  I mean, there was a 3 trial in Grutter, as Your Honor pointed out in your 4 decision in Fisher I.  There's been no trial here. 5             There is, at a minimum  if  if  if our 6 evidence doesn't cross the bar on strict scrutiny, at a 7 minimum, we put in triable issues of fact on whether or 8 not the holistic plan was a necessary offset, whether or 9 not the university was achieving its educational 10 objectives in an environment in which you had 272 11 AfricanAmerican students enroll out of an incoming 12 class of 8,000, an environment in which 90 percent of 13 the classrooms had  the most common side had zero to 14 one. 15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But why can't we make 16 those inferences from the record?  I mean, if  if you 17 had a trial, you'd have credibility.  You'd have experts 18 and so forth  19             MR. GARRE:  Well, I  I  I think you can 20 make those going in the university's favor.  And one 21 aspect of that, frankly, is the twocourt rule that this 22 Court usually applies.  Both the district court and the 23 court of appeals looked at this and made findings  24             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What you're saying, we  25 we have a  a remand only if we lose.  I mean, that's
Alderson Reporting Company

1 what you're saying.

2             (Laughter.)

3             MR. GARRE:  Well, I mean, I don't want to

4 be resultoriented about this, Your Honor.  But  but I

5 do think that  that it's one thing to say in this

6 record there are no triable facts, where the  the

7 courts below have gone that way.  It's another thing to

8 secondguess.  And  and the Court can.  It's a summary

9 judgment issue.  But it's another thing, I think, to

10 overstep the conclusions of the district court and the

11 court of appeals here.

12             And  and I think it's particularly

13 relevant here when it comes to the operation of the Top

14 10 Percent Law.  Our friends have challenged the fact

15 that the Fifth Circuit discussed the way in which it

16 operated, saying that that's outside the record.  If it

17 is, let us put all that evidence directly into the

18 record.  But they've never disputed the way in which the

19 Top 10 Percent Law operates.

20             What  what I'd like to say too is, if this

21 Court rules that University of Texas can't consider

22 race, or if it rules that universities that consider

23 race have to die a death of a thousand cuts for doing

24 so, we know exactly what's going to happen.  Experience

25 tells us that.

5 California, Berkeley, and UCLA, after Prop 209.  And

6 that is exactly what's taking place today at the

7 University of Michigan.

8             Now is not the time, and this is certainly

9 not the case 

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  There are  there are

11 those who contend that it does not benefit

12 AfricanAmericans to  to get them into the University

13 of Texas where they do not do well, as opposed to having

14 them go to a lessadvanced school, a less  a

15 slowertrack school where they do well.  One of  one

16 of the briefs pointed out that  that most of the 

17 most of the black scientists in this country don't come

18 from schools like the University of Texas.

19             MR. GARRE:  So this Court 

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  They come from lesser

21 schools where they do not feel that they're  that

22 they're being pushed ahead in  in classes that are

23 too  too fast for them.

24             MR. GARRE:  This Court 

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm just not impressed by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
68 1 the fact that  that the University of Texas may have 2 fewer.  Maybe it ought to have fewer.  And maybe some  3 you know, when you take more, the number of blacks, 4 really competent blacks admitted to lesser schools, 5 turns out to be less.  And  and I  I don't think 6 it  it  it stands to reason that it's a good thing 7 for the University of Texas to admit as many blacks as 8 possible.  I just don't think  9             MR. GARRE:  This Court heard and rejected 10 that argument, with respect, Justice Scalia, in the 11 Grutter case, a case that our opponents haven't asked 12 this Court to overrule.  If you look at the academic 13 performance of holistic minority admits versus the top 14 10 percent admits, over time, they  they fare better. 15             And, frankly, I don't think the solution to 16 the problems with student body diversity can be to set 17 up a system in which not only are minorities going to 18 separate schools, they're going to inferior schools.  I 19 think what experience shows, at Texas, California, and 20 Michigan, is that now is not the time and this is not 21 the case to roll back student body diversity in America. 22             Thank you, Your Honors. 23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel. 24             General Verrilli. 25         ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B.

69

2                SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

3             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and

4 may it please the Court:

5             I'd like to make a point about the

6 compellinginterest inquiry in light of what this Court

7 said previously in Fisher, and then I'd like to make

8 point about the process aspect of the narrowtailoring

9 inquiry in light of what this Court said in Fisher,

10 which I believe Justice Kennedy will address your

11 concerns about whether race is determinative here.  And

12 then I'd like to move on to what I think this case comes

13 down to, which is whether the University has made a

14 sufficient showing of need to consider race in  in its

15 process.

16             But before I make any of those points, Mr.

17 Chief Justice, I  I can provide some specific detail

18 in response to the question you asked earlier related to

19 the parentsinvolved point.

20             Here are the numbers.  With respect to

21 AfricanAmerican students admitted through the holistic

22 part of the program, in 2004, which was the last year

23 before race was expressly considered, that number was

24 141 admitted through that number.  And that was the

25 highwater mark, really, of the period of  of holistic

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 review without race.

70

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In addition to

3 the  this is in addition to the 10 percent?

4             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Correct.  This is just

5 the holistic numbers.

6             That number then moves up to 176 the

7 following year, to 220 the year after, and to 262 in

8 2007.  So the number of holistic admissions almost

9 doubles, and that results in 

10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the problem, I

11 guess, which is one issue that we haven't looked at is

12 how do you tell how many of those 

13             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Right.

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   would have been

15 admitted if their race were not 

16             GENERAL VERRILLI:  You're right  you're

17 right that you can't tell for sure, but you do have a

18 pretty good benchmark, I think, given that you have a

19 number of years without considering race where 141 was

20 the highwater mark.  And so I do 

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, wait a minute.  The

22 next two years you recited it was going up, even when

23 race was considered.

24             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Right.

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you could have said

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
71 1 there  there is a fluctuation before then, when race 2 wasn't considered.  That might have gone up, too. 3             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, it went  before 4 they started considering race, it went up and down, 5 frankly.  But 141 was the highwater mark.  There wasn't 6 a consistent trajectory in those numbers. 7             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, there's an aspect of 8 the holistic review process done at the University of 9 Texas which may militate against the admission of 10 AfricanAmerican and Hispanic students for a  an 11 ostensibly raceneutral reason, and that is, that as I 12 understand it, standardized test scores count pretty 13 heavily in that process. 14             One of the things the University says it's 15 looking for is students with high SAT scores who are not 16 in the top 10 percent of their class.  And there are 17 many who think that SAT scores and ACT scores are 18 culturally biased.  So if you put less emphasis on that, 19 you might not have the numbers that you just recited. 20             Well, it's rather strange that we  we 21 construct the process that may disadvantage 22 AfricanAmerican and Hispanic students for an ostensibly 23 raceneutral reason.  So then we have to add race in as 24 a special factor to counteract that. 25             GENERAL VERRILLI:  It's  or I guess what
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
72 1 I'd say about that, Your Honor, is that in Grutter, what 2 the Court specifically held was that the University is 3 allowed to make those kinds of judgments in seeking to 4 advance multiple objectives to maintain an academic 5 environment of excellence, and to diversify the student 6 body, both. 7             JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought the  I thought 8 the record showed the top ten admittees have a higher 9 grade point average than the holistic AfricanAmerican 10 and Hispanic admittees. 11             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, the  the SAT 12 scores are about the same.  I'm not sure  13             JUSTICE ALITO:  But, I mean, once they get 14 to  15             GENERAL VERRILLI:  But I guess  16             JUSTICE ALITO:  Once they get to  the SAT 17 is supposed to predict how you are going to do in 18 college.  And I thought the record showed that the 19 students who have lower SAT scores but did better as 20 a  by measure by high school rank did better at the 21 University of Texas; isn't that  isn't that the case? 22             GENERAL VERRILLI:  So I  I'm not sure what 23 the answer to that is, Your Honor, but this all goes to 24 the compellinginterest inquiry, and let me focus on 25 that.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
73 1             What the  what the Court said last time 2 around is to satisfy the compellinginterest inquiry, 3 the University has got to articulate a reasoned, 4 principled explanation for its decision to consider the 5 educational benefits of diversity in a matter that this 6 Court has found to be constitutional and substantial. 7             The University of Texas has met that 8 standard, has articulated exactly the same educational 9 benefits of diversity at exactly the same level of 10 specificity that this Court held constituted a 11 compelling interest in the Grutter case at page 330. 12 It's exactly the same. 13             And the  the principal argument that my 14 friend Mr. Rein makes in challenging that is, well, 15 actually a lot of that is post hoc rationalization, in 16 particular, the effort to find whether you call it 17 qualitative diversity, diversity within diversity is all 18 post hoc rationalization, that is simply not so. 19             If you look at page 1 of the Supplemental 20 Joint Appendix, the first page of the 2004 Proposal, the 21 University specifically says that what it's trying to 22 accomplish is to create a diversity of perspectives 23 among minority students.  It says it again at page 28 in 24 that proposal.  The Director of Admissions Declaration, 25 page 43 of the Joint Appendix, says it  it says it

1 throughout.  So that there's no  there's just no

74

2 argument that it's a post hoc rationalization.

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Verrilli, do you  you

4 think all of this won't be necessary in another 13

5 years 

6             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well 

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:   where we stop

8 disadvantaging some applicants because of their race.

9             GENERAL VERRILLI:  What I think about that

10 is that the  the Court, I think, made a prediction

11 in  in Grutter that that would hopefully be the case.

12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think that's a  that's

13 too short term.  What do you think 

14             GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think 

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:   30 years?

16             GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think the University's

17 always 

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is it about this

19 program that is going to change things, so that  so

20 that we can stop classifying people by race?

21             GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  I  I  I think

22 the universities do make progress on this, and I think

23 you do get to a point where you create a virtuous cycle.

24 And  and I think it does work, and I think that

25 there's  there's  and  and I think there's ample

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
75 1 reason to  to believe that it does work.  And I think 2 the key point here with respect to compelling interests 3 is that this really is  in  in terms of having the 4 educational benefits diversity, that's in the heartland 5 of what the Court has said, is the area in which the 6 University's expertise and experience deserves 7 deference. 8             Now, if I could go to the process point, 9 with respect to  10             JUSTICE BREYER:  Just before, you  you 11 said  I agreed with you, of course, that is what the 12 Court said, the reasoned explanation.  And it also said 13 that this is a matter to which this Court will give 14 some, but not complete, deference to what the University 15 decides.  What you're talking about is the need for the 16 program. 17             In addition to that  and this is what I'd 18 like you to focus on, because there could be a question 19 of whether to send it back for more evidence or not.  So 20 in looking through the record so far, on this specific 21 point, I found an affidavit by a person named Walker, 22 and that person named Walker described seven years of 23 efforts to measure this stuff; described meetings of the 24 faculties; described all kinds of discussions; described 25 conclusions of the faculty members, and the admissions
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
76 1 officers, and others, that you did need  you did need 2 affirmative action in the 25 percent of the not  of  3 of the holistic part. 4             Now, given that that's there, and I found 5 nothing to the contrary, is there a need for another  6 I mean, this is a loaded question, but I am curious.  If 7 you say "yes," because  I mean, you know, there may be 8 something that you should put in as well.  You may think 9 it would help to put something in.  You may think it's 10 not necessary.  But just to be safe, what do you think? 11             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yeah  12             JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that affidavit the 13 relevant one?  Are there others? 14             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yeah.  I think  I 15 believe that's the affidavit from the director of 16 admissions.  And it is highly relevant, and there is 17 other information.  In the latter part of our brief, we 18 documented it. 19             We think  you know, our view, we argued 20 for affirmance.  We think it's sufficient.  But if there 21 is doubt, I do think the additional kind of information 22 that might be developed in this case would be to look at 23 the kinds of questions that the Chief Justice was 24 actually asking about, how did the  how has the 25 program worked in practice over the period of time in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
77 1 which it's been implemented.  And I think that would be 2 additional relevant information that might help make the 3 judgment. 4             If I could go to the process point, and then 5 I will return to the need point. 6             Process  what the Court said last time 7 around in this case was that the Court had to ensure 8 itself without deference that the process provided for 9 individualized consideration and that race did not 10 predominate. 11             Again, the University of Texas' plan has 12 every one of what the Court in Grutter at page 334 said 13 were the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan.  No 14 quota.  Everybody competes against everybody else.  No 15 automatic award of points.  Modest factor. 16             And in addition  and this goes to your 17 question, Justice Kennedy, about whether there is an 18 argument here that race is determinative  Texas is 19 different from the University of Michigan's law school 20 plan in every one of the four ways that Your Honor 21 identified as  as being potentially troublesome and 22 making race determinative. 23             Unlike in Michigan, in Texas the percentage 24 of AfricanAmerican and Hispanics admitted does not 25 mirror the percentage who applied.  It's different.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             Unlike Texas, the number  excuse me.

78

2 Unlike Michigan, the number in Texas of  of admissions

3 fluctuates year over year.  It's not the same every

4 year.

5             Unlike in Michigan, the bulk of Hispanic and

6 AfricanAmerican students admitted don't come from a

7 small subset of the pool that's admitted after most are

8 admitted based on grades.

9             And unlike in Michigan, the  there  the

10 admissions officers don't monitor the process all the

11 way along, which would, as Your Honor suggested, perhaps

12 create the risk that race would become determinative in

13 latter States' admissions.  None of that is true here.

14             So  so I think with respect to 

15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If none of that is

16 true, how does the University know when it has achieved

17 its objective?

18             GENERAL VERRILLI:  So 

19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  At what point does

20 it say, okay, the plan has worked?

21             GENERAL VERRILLI:  So I think  I was

22 trying to address process, and I  and I'll go right

23 now to need, which I think is  is  I really do think

24 that you're right, Mr. Chief Justice.  That's what the

25 case comes down to.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
79 1             And I will answer your question directly, 2 but I first want to make a point about how you don't  3 how you shouldn't do it.  And you shouldn't do it the 4 way the Petitioner has suggested you should do it. 5             What the Petitioner has said is that the  6 in order to  in order to assess need, and the  and 7 the only way to meet  meet the need portion of the 8 strictscrutiny analysis, is for the University to set 9 a, quote, "demographic goal."  That's the Petitioner's 10 language.  And then test whether or not they've made 11 that goal. 12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So how  13             GENERAL VERRILLI:  And so  14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   how should they 15 do it? 16             GENERAL VERRILLI:  So the  the  and the 17 reason, of course, that that's no good is that that's 18 just a Catch22. 19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  I 20 understand you disagree with their proposal. 21             GENERAL VERRILLI:  So  so here's how you 22 should do it, and we've  we've laid it out in our 23 brief:  We think that the approach  we think that 24 approach is always going to be fatal in fact because, if 25 they don't  they  they fail strict scrutiny if

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I know you don't

3 agree with their approach.

4             (Laughter.)

5             GENERAL VERRILLI:  I  I promise you I'm

6 going to answer it.  I just think these points are

7 important.

8             Then  and so the  with respect, we think

9 our approach is faithful to Fisher because it's not

10 always fatal in fact.  What we say is that it's not

11 an  a critical mass, numerical kind of analysis.  We

12 say that what you do is you start with the University's

13 articulation of the educational benefits it's trying to

14 achieve.  You require the University to state in

15 concrete terms what success will look like.  You then

16 evaluate the evidence and analysis that the University

17 relied on in order to make the judgment that it isn't

18 where it needs to be and there  and needs to consider

19 race 

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm trying to get at

21 the 

22             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.  And so in the kinds

23 of 

24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   at a  at a more

25 concrete  and so to look at what they say they want

1 and see if they've done it, but how do you see it?

81

2             GENERAL VERRILLI:  And  and you  and so

3 the kind  you would look for concrete evidence.  You

4 know, well  welldone classroom studies.

5 Welldesigned surveys of student attitudes and faculty

6 attitudes.  Graduation and retention rates.  Are racial

7 incidents going up and down  up or down on  on

8 campus in frequency?

9             You  you know, there could be a whole list

10 of them.  But you would look at those.  You would look

11 at  you would look at those.  You would look at the

12 University's analysis of those, and then you'd make a

13 judgment whether the University has substantiated its

14 case.

15             And the burden, of course, is on the

16 University.  They've got to come in and convince you

17 that they've substantiated their case that they need to

18 consider race 

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And they  they can do

20 that with evidence that  and  and of events that

21 occurred after the suit was brought?

22             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I  I think

23 what 

24             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I  I'm not quite sure

25 how that works.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
82 1             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Sure.  I think that they 2 can  and  and as happened in Grutter, I think they 3 have  the  the interests that they rely on have to 4 be the interests that they contemporaneously identified 5 when they adopted the program.  I don't think there's an 6 issue here on that. 7             But I think the evidence can include 8 evidence of how things are working in practice.  For 9 example, if they adopt a system and it does result in 10 improvement, that does seem highly relevant and  and 11 consistent with what the Court held in Grutter was 12 appropriate evidence. 13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The reason I  I 14 think it's a matter of concern is  what I heard from 15 Mr. Garre were a lot of numbers.  He said, look, this is 16 why it's needed, and  and, you know, we will know 17 we're doing better when the numbers look better. 18             And I just wonder whether the idea of 19 surveys  I looked at one of these surveys  I don't 20 remember this record or the  the prior one  and I 21 have to say it was kind of sophomoric.  I mean, do you 22 feel that you've had enough interactions  23             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes. 24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   with  I mean, 25 that was  this is consideration of race.  It's a very

83

2             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.

3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And to pass out some

4 survey and see, I don't think is an adequate 

5             GENERAL VERRILLI:  It certainly wouldn't be

6 adequate by itself.  It might be probative evidence in

7 combination with other probative evidence.  But  you

8 know, but the  the question of classroom composition

9 is hard evidence.

10             And at some level, demographics are hard

11 evidence too, Mr. Chief Justice.  When you're talking

12 about the AfricanAmerican population at the University

13 of Texas in  in Austin, you're talking about a

14 population of 3 or 400 kids in a class of 6,000, I think

15 the  the idea that there is a material risk of racial

16 isolation in that situation is quite strong.  The idea

17 that there is a material chance that lots and lots of

18 students are going to go 

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  600 is going to make the

20 difference?

25 with 600?

2 significant difference.

3             And if I could, in the time I have

4 remaining, I'd like to just try to refocus the Court on

5 the importance of what's at stake here.

6             As we told you in our brief, our military

7 leaders believe that it is imperative that we have

8 officer corps that are not only diverse but capable of

9 leading a diverse military, not only for effectiveness

10 but for the very legitimacy of sending our troops into

11 harm's way.

12             JUSTICE ALITO:  But do you think that the

13 AfricanAmerican and Hispanic students who were admitted

14 under the top 10 percent plan make inferior officers

15 when compared to those who were admitted under holistic

16 review?

17             GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, I don't.  Not at all.

18 But I 

19             JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that the 

20 that the ROTC graduates from the University of Texas

21 make superior officers to those who  who graduate

22 from, let's say, Texas A&M or Texas Tech?

23             GENERAL VERRILLI:  Here's what I think about

24 that, Justice Alito:  I think that we want to make

25 sure  and this military example is only one of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
85 1 important interests here.  But with respect to that, we 2 want to make sure, not just that there are strong 3 AfricanAmerican and Hispanic candidates in that ROTC 4 program, but that everybody who graduates from the ROTC 5 program, University of Texas  white, black, Asian, 6 Hispanic  everybody knows how to lead effectively in 7 a  in a diverse environment in which they're going to 8 be leading diverse troops.  That's the interest. 9             And you can't achieve that  10             JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, that's certainly 11 important, but to come back to my first question, is 12 there anything to suggest that the top 10 percent 13 students are less likely to enroll in ROTC or, when they 14 do, they're not as good as the  as the holistic 15 admittees? 16             GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  I  I think with 17 respect to the University of Texas in particular.  But 18 I  I'm also  you know, what the Court is going to 19 say in this case obviously is going to apply to  20 eventually to every university in the country. 21             And this is an important interest for the 22 United States generally, that when you think about 23 what's at stake here, that the  the interest in 24 ensuring that we have military officers who can lead a 25 diverse military force is critical.

1             The interest in having law enforcement

5             Corporate America has told you that having

6 a  a  a workforce that is able to function

7 effectively in diverse  in diverse situations is

8 critical.

9             And what I would just say in conclusion is

10 that these are the considered judgments of people who

11 actually have the responsibility to ensure that the

12 vital functions of the government protecting the country

13 with the military and with law enforcement and the vital

14 functions of commerce  these are the people who

15 actually have to make sure that those functions are

16 carried out.  And this is their considered judgment, and

18 analysis.

25 nitpicky and detailed and  compared to what you were

Alderson Reporting Company

1 talking about.

Official

87

2             And I agree.  I notice that the briefs in

3 this case are like the briefs in Grutter.  And to me

4 that does suggest that people in the universities and

5 elsewhere are worried that we will, to use your

6 colleague's expression, kill affirmative action through

7 a death by a thousand cuts.

8             We promised in Fisher I that we wouldn't.

9 That opinion by seven people reflected no one's views

10 perfectly.  But that's what it says:  Not fatal in fact.

11             Okay.  That's what I'm focusing on.  It

12 seems to me there are two parts to that, whether we have

13 to send it back for another hearing or not.

14             Part one you've dealt with.  That's is there

15 a need?  A matter which Fisher I says we will give some

16 but not complete deference to the University, and as you

17 say, we have  you went through that.

18             There is a second part which I want you to

19 address.  The second part in Fisher, we said, there is

20 no deference due the University.  On this part it's

21 called narrow tailoring.

22             You heard your friend on the other side

23 admit, he said, again.  Maybe he believes it firmly.

24 Why use the word "admit"?  He said that, in the plans of

25 Grutter and the plans of Bakke, those were okay in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
88 1 respect to narrow tailoring because they did compare the 2 students one after another and use race as a plus 3 factor. 4             Now, what is there in this record that will 5 support the view that what Texas has done in respect to 6 narrow tailoring is no worse than, perhaps even better 7 than, what happened in Grutter or Bakke? 8             GENERAL VERRILLI:  So I  I would point 9 Your Honor specifically to the declaration at pages 483a 10 and 484  and 484a of the Joint Appendix of the 11 admissions director, in which he explains the way race 12 is considered in the University of Texas system.  And 13 that explanation says expressly, at page 483, that race 14 is considered in exactly the same manner, and given 15 exactly the same consideration as every other special 16 circumstance's factor that the university considers as 17 part of its holistic review. 18             That  I think that shows you that actually 19 you know more about the way this program works than you 20 did about the program that you affirmed in Grutter, and 21 you have assurance based on that, and nothing in the 22 record contradicts it that that's the way it operates. 23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you.

11 and it  it's in his opinion.  It's  it's not only by

12 percentage, but it's by number, and that number is

13 insignificant relative 

14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think  do you

15 think that change has to happen overnight?  And do you

16 think it's 

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  Can I  can I

18 hear what you were about to say?  What are those

19 numbers?  I was really curious to hear those numbers.

20             MR. REIN:  He assumed, at the outside, that

21 any of the admits that were actually AfricanAmerican or

22 Hispanic outside the Top Ten, he said let me take that

23 assumption and see what it would add.  And he said it

24 would constitute less than 1 percent and 2.5 percent,

25 respectively, in  of the entire 6,322person case 

Alderson Reporting Company

1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What are you reading

2 from?

3             MR. REIN:  But he did not  can I finish?

4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you just tell me

5 where you're reading from?

6             MR. REIN:  This is Appendix 250 to 251a.  It

7 is Judge Garza's original dissent.  This is  this is

8 when  and he repeated, essentially, the same point.

9 But he calculated, and he made different assumptions,

10 depending on how many of the admissions in the holistic

11 program one would assume would be different because of

12 race.  Because no one knows, and that  and that's part

13 of this.

14             And clearly, one  and  and  I can read

15 you these numbers, but you can read them yourselves.

16 It's a very small number.  And his most realistic

17 estimate was that it would yield only 15

18 AfricanAmericans and 40 Hispanic students in a class of

19 6,000.  So we're talking about a very small effect, even

20 with assumptions that  that actually exist.

21             You know, one point is it's small.  The

22 second point, equally important, is no one knew because

23 they didn't study it.

24             And then  then we get the same point on

25 this complementary, which was the big theme of the Fifth

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Circuit, oh, it's a necessary complement.  What does

91

2 that mean?  One sense, you've got to have some plan if

3 you're going to cap the Top Ten at 75 percent, so it's

4 necessary to do something.  But that doesn't make it a

5 necessary complement.

6             When you really look what the Fifth Circuit

7 said, they said it's based on two assumptions:  One, the

8 Top Ten are drawn from these minority high schools.

9 Where did they come up with that?  They never studied

10 the pattern of the Top Ten admits.

11             How do you know that a Hispanic or an

12 AfricanAmerican student can't be in the Top Ten at what

13 they call an integrated, highperforming high school?

14 That's a stereotypical assumption.

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I  I  I  what

16 you're saying, basically, is, is this is what the Fifth

17 Circuit concluded and which the school basically agrees,

18 okay?  If you don't consider race, then holistic

19 percentage, whatever it is, is going to be virtually all

20 white.

21             MR. REIN:  And that is incorrect.

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All white.

23             MR. REIN:  And that is an assumption 

24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And to say  no 

25             MR. REIN:   that has no basis in this

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh, but there is 

3             MR. REIN:  It's a stereotypical 

4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, it's not 

5             MR. REIN:   assumption.  That is what it

6 is.

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's not, because the

8 reality 

9             MR. REIN:  With all deference 

10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   that Justice 

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Rein 

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   Alito wants to rely

13 on.

14             Let me finish my point.

15             He's right.  For their educational needs,

16 there are competing criteria.  They need to keep a

17 certain SAT, or whatever that's called, AI index, that

18 has to be high because of the quality they want to keep

19 the school at.  That does discriminate against blacks on

20 some levels, because the difference in numbers are high.

21             So if you have something like this,

22 you're  what you're saying, basically, is, and what

23 he's proposing, is change your educational needs across

24 the board, and focus in only on race, and make sure that

25 your school is black, Hispanic, or whatever on numbers

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that are going to reduce its educational quality.

93

2             That's basically what you're arguing, isn't

3 it?

4             MR. REIN:  No.  And  and to be fair, I

5 mean, the first thing I was just pointing out is that to

6 get to the conclusion of the Fifth Circuit, you have to

7 first assume the pattern of admits in the Top Ten, where

8 they come from, which was never established in the

9 record, never studied.

10             And the second is that you have to assume

11 that those coming from  all students coming from these

12 integrated, highperforming high schools don't include,

13 in their Top 10 percent, any minority.

14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why?  What we know is 

15             MR. REIN:  That's what he assumes.

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   the school doesn't

17 have enough 

18             MR. REIN:  Justice Sotomayor 

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   no matter what it

20 does, it doesn't have enough numbers of black people.

21             MR. REIN:  That  that comes back to the

22 fundamental point.

23             If we're just talking numbers, then you have

24 to show the compelling need for more numbers, so that 

25 one of the reasons for defining your compelling need is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
94 1 that you have to then look at necessity in terms of the 2 need. 3             So as in Grutter, what they said was we have 4 insufficient numbers of minorities to provoke the 5 appropriate dialogue.  When we look at the class as a 6 whole, we think we can do better if we introduce 7 different points of view.  It's very individualized; 8 it's a small class. 9             So you can then say, increasing numbers  10 which they were certainly after, you know, from three to 11 14  will meet that compelling need. 12             Since they never bothered to administer, you 13 know, to define the needs, it's really hard to say what 14 they were after and why numbers would or would not 15 satisfy, and whether the numbers they were generating, 16 which included 15 percent of the socalled holistic 17 admits so it wasn't all white enterprise, why that 18 wouldn't work. 19             The key point is, you have to come to the 20 Court with the record.  You can't make it up later, 21 because that would say do what you want, and when the 22 time comes, make it up.  That's not  no way to 23 litigate. 24             And in this case they said, we're ready for 25 summary judgment; we've put in everything we need.  If
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
95 1 you look at their specific proffers  and the court of 2 appeals, they said they wanted to take discovery.  And 3 even Judge Higginbotham, their best friend, said, from 4 who?  What does Ms. Fisher know about this?  What are 5 you going to take discovery about?  And he found no need 6 in this Court, all they say is, we'd like to reiterate 7 the benefits of diversity, but those were accepted, and 8 we'd like a few testimonials about students admitted 9 holistically without knowing whether they were the 10 beneficiaries of the race or not.  You can't  can't 11 litigate that way. 12             Thank you, Your Honor. 13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 14 The case is submitted. 15             (Whereupon, at 11:38 a.m., the case in the 16 aboveentitled matter was submitted.) 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
