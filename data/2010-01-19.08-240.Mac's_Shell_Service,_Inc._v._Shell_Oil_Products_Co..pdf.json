    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted the PMPA to regulate two specific, but important, actions: Franchisors' termination of the franchise prior to the conclusion of the franchise term and the franchisors’ non-renewal of the franchise relationship at the end of the agreement's term. The statute responded to complaints about franchisors exercising broad contractual rights to terminate the franchise relationship that was not addressed by -- for trivial violations or at will, that was not previously addressed by State law. But Congress left all other aspects of the franchise relationship to State law. Because the term \"terminate,\" at the very least, requires an end, we and the United States agree that the First Circuit erred in upholding a so-called constructive termination, where the dealers continued to receive each element of the statutory franchise -- that is the premises, the trademark, and fuel --"

The term \"constructive eviction\" we would -- we believe does exist, along with \"constructive discharge.\" But the precise terms that Congress used here were \"terminate,\" \"non-renew,\" and \"cancel,\" which are drawn from the law of contracts and the U.C.C., in particular, and from State franchise statutes. We --"

  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "Yes. It's not so much that we differ; it's that our fallback position is the same as the government's, but they do not endorse our primary position, which is that there is no such thing as constructive termination. We believe it would be a mistake to recognize constructive termination in this context for three reasons: The first is the one I already mentioned, is that, in the most analogous context that existed at the time Congress acted, State franchise statutes that used terms like \"terminate,\" \"non-renew,\" \"cancel,\" the terms that Congress used, there was -- the notion of constructive termination was frankly unheard of. Even today, under those statutes it is not a well-accepted concept, having been rejected by approximately half the States to have considered it."

That is the nature, even where constructive discharge and constructive termination -- constructive eviction claims, are recognized. That is the settled rule. If you have something else, for example, there’s a breach of contract, you can claim your breach of contract, and you can sue for damages while continuing to operate. But if you're going to claim that it wasn't a mere breach of contract, but in fact it was a constructive termination, that you've lost all the rights to continue to operate -- you may not get fuel, you may not get --"

In other words, if they say -- I don't know how the deal works, but, you know, you've got to charge $10 a gallon or, you know, you've got to close the convenient mart or whatever, you have lost the right to operate at that. The terms of the lease under which you were operating have been effectively terminated. That doesn't mean you can't still make money, and it doesn't mean you have to give that up, but --"

But termination in contract law has long been understood to be something entirely different, which is the absolute refusal to provide the elements such that it's obvious to any observer that there is -- these elements will not be resumed. Corbin on Contracts, for example, describes termination as occurring \"when either party, pursuant to a power created by agreement or law, puts an end to the contract,” “extinguishing future obligations of both parties to the agreement.\""

But if one accepts the construct of the constructive termination, those would be different results, because, at the very least, termination requires an end to one of the franchise elements. And the individual who sues, having not -- having -- still receiving all the franchise elements, hasn't been terminated in any sense of the word. But the key thing is he actually has a breach of contract action. Raising the price unreasonably on an open price term has long, uniformly, comprehensively been addressed by State law, like U.C.C. 2-305. So the answer always is you can sue for breach of contract. And Congress wasn't worried about the fact there might be breaches of contract that ordinary contract remedies don't sufficiently remedy. Congress's concern was the exercise of contractually broad rights to terminate and non-renew the relationship. And --"

Fuel will not be coming. You may not use our trademark, or you may no longer use our premises. A constructive termination, as I understand the concept, could be something -- and this is the difficulty with the concept -- something like charging too much, an excessive price, which is a breach of contract, which would prevent a reasonable franchisee from continuing to accept that element."

And the difficulty is, the moment you move this into the issue of price, suddenly the issue of price -- how much the franchisor can charge is a question of Federal law, in a statute that just talks about termination and non-renewal."

For example, insisting on your ordinary contractual rights cannot be a constructive termination. It must also be a breach of contract, which is precisely why it doesn't add very much to -- it’s unlikely that Congress intended to incorporate it, because those things that already breached the contract were already addressed by State law. There was no --"

But in the ordinary cases you see a 1 percent increase in gas prices in highly volatile petroleum markets. For example, in this case, where Shell raised its prices considerably but was still charging less than Exxon and Chevron, as the joint appendix 225 and 237 made clear, that's what you end up with as claims for constructive termination, if you recognize constructive termination. But Congress was worried about actual terminations, the exercise of contractual rights, broad contractual rights, to terminate that were formerly not regulated, not breaches of contract that were already regulated by -- comprehensively, by State law.

What's the standard for determining whether there was a constructive termination?"

    "speaker": "O'NEIL",

Indeed, we think it may be easier to answer that question in this context, because constructive discharge and constructive eviction will often turn on intangible psychological factors like the level of indignity that an employee would suffer before leaving his job. Gas station franchises are operated for -- to make money, and if it would be impossible for a franchisee to do that, then a reasonable franchisee in those circumstances would have no choice but to --"

And if the franchisee could continue in business, then it is not a constructive termination. The franchisee might have a claim for breach of contract, but as long as -- as long as it would not be a fitting response to actually abandon the premises, then that is not a constructive termination."

    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, I am not aware of those cases, and I think the general rule is the one that -- that is -- is broadly stated in the cases, which is that if the franchisee -- excuse me, if the tenant wants to claim constructive eviction, they need to leave the premises. That is a bedrock principle of the law, that in order to claim constructive eviction, you actually have to leave."

Nevertheless, Shell and Motiva argue that conduct designed to force the dealers out of business is insufficient to invoke statutory protection because the dealers were not deprived of any of the statutory elements of the franchise, and they remained in business for some period following the rental increase. If accepted, the practical effect of Shell and Motiva's position will allow franchisors to circumvent the PMPA and terminate franchises at any time, at any reason, by simply increasing the burden on their operations."

    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "What's the test? Because if you say we are going to give an action to a person who didn't clear out, although the franchisor was trying to get him to clear out, you are then going to convert into a Federal action every single breach of contract or serious breach of contract that there is, which is the precise opposite of what Congress wanted when it passed this statute. So, what is your test as to we know that your case is the lions and tigers case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "Justice Breyer, I believe that you hit on two points: First off, what is the test sufficient to invoke a constructive termination? And then, secondly, a point that the panel has addressed is whether or not abandonment of the franchise is required by the statute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "I wouldn't put it that way. I’d say constructive termination means you didn't terminate. Okay? That's what \"constructive\" means. It means you didn't do it. But sometimes a franchisor could act in such a way that the law should treat it as if he really did. All right? I can imagine a test for that. But we have the second problem here, is that even if the conduct was designed -- it's equal to terminating it -- this individual didn't leave."

    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor --"
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "The test, Your Honor -- first off, with respect to whether the conduct is sufficient to force a termination, we believe the First Circuit's standard of materiality, which is effective to end one of the components of the statutorily defined franchise, is sufficient. With respect to the second part of your question, which is why didn't these dealers leave the station, and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "No. I want to know your test for deciding -- even though the first part is met, how you apply it when the person didn't leave? I understand a person who left. He left."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "Right. JUSTICE BREYER: The franchisor says: I didn't tell him to leave. And then you go look to see if the franchisor's conduct was so bad, it was the same as if you told him to leave. I've got that part. The part I don't have is what happens if he doesn't leave? Because one thing we know, the conduct wasn't so bad that this person left, because he didn't leave. That's that second part that's bothering me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "And Your Honor, I'm not sure there’s a test for that, but certainly the statute doesn't contemplate that the dealer would have to leave. For example, the injunctive remedy in the statute would allow a dealer to come in --"

    "speaker": "BREYER",

    "speaker": "BREYER",

  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",

    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "We do have a test, Your Honor, and the test is whether or not the conduct has effectively eliminated an essential component of one of the three elements of the franchise. In this case, the First Circuit used a materiality standard that said that the lease was effectively ended. And in the context of the statute, the franchise as defined by the three elements, what the judge asked the jury to determine was, was the agreement that Shell entered into with these franchisees, with the essential component being the subsidy, was that effectively eliminated --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "What does that mean, \"effectively eliminated\"? The -- the First Circuit said, if \"the breach of the lease was such a material change that it effectively ended the lease, even though the plaintiffs continued to operate the business\" -- I have no idea what that means. What does it mean to effectively end the lease even though the lease continues?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, Justice Alito. The statute contemplates a distinction in the relationship between a franchise, which is a set of contracts, and a franchise relationship. A franchise relationship continues after the expiration of the -- of the franchise. In this case here what the judge was charging the jury was -- what the question was, was the breach of the lease so material that it effectively ended the -- the agreement that Shell had entered into with its dealers, regardless of the fact that there was some relationship that continued with the parties afterwards? In other words --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",

But we also recognize that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Can we -- can -- perhaps to bring this to more practical terms, you can walk through with me. I'm going to assume that if a franchisor changes a rent term and the franchisee refuses to pay, wouldn't the franchisor at some point give a notice of termination? What franchisor is going to sit through months and months and years of waiting for payment before kicking someone out? Is it -- is that rationally going to happen in any situation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I would -- I would concede that in all likelihood, a franchisor would take some affirmative conduct, whether that be through a notice of termination or other step. But, yes, that would happen."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Or -- or, so that in almost all situations, at least with respect to the leased premises, in a breach of the leased premises, the termination would be -- would have to happen."

    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I -- I respectfully disagree. And I think the government and Shell would both concede that written notification, although required by the statute, is not necessarily always going to be given."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "I know. But at some point the franchisor is going to have to take over the premises, either by trying to evict the person or locking them out. No -- no rational franchisor is going to raise rent, not have the franchisee pay, and fail to terminate the agreement."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "That -- that may be true, Your Honor. But in this case here what Shell's position is that they can -- they can -- and -- and put such intolerable conduct at issue, for example, raising the rent by several hundred percent, and that doesn't constitute a termination in any respect, even if -- even if the dealer were to leave. They argue that they must affirmatively withhold one of the statutory elements of the franchise from the dealer."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "But the franchisee could always just stop paying the rent. He doesn't have to leave the premises."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "That's right, Your Honor. And again -- again the statute doesn't contemplate -- and -- and we have to, again, go back to the statute to recognize what the word \"termination\" means in the context of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act. Certainly, Shell envisions that it means that there must be an end to the relationship. The Solicitor would concede, I believe, that the dealer could remain on the premises if there was such sufficient conduct to force them out of business that a reasonable person would think they have no ability to continue in business. But then the Solicitor imposes a condition that that franchisee must seek an injunction in order to have a claim under the Act. Our position is that the injunction is a form of a relief to protect the franchisee, to maintain the status quo. But the existence of a claim under the statute does not depend upon whether or not the franchisee seeks the injunction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "And you didn't -- you didn't -- well, you sought an injunction, but Judge Zobel thought it was -- it came much too late."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "Your Honor, this -- this case has had a -- a long history to it. The case was initially filed as In the matter of Tsanikilides in the U.S. district court and assigned to Judge Zobel. Our prior counsel did seek an injunction. It's not clear on the record why that injunction was withdrawn at the time that the Tsanikilides case was dismissed. But then when the Marcoux or the Mac's Shell case was re-filed, it’s correct that the dealers did not initially move for injunctive relief. And I think there were two reasons for that. Number one, it was always contemplated with Judge Zobel that this matter would proceed on an expedited basis, that discovery would lead to trial within a very short period of time. And, number two, even though there is a relaxed standard for injunctive relief, it was not clear that the dealers would be able to sufficiently meet their burden of proof to demonstrate to the court that an injunction should be issued. Again, we are dealing here in a practical effect of asking an oil company on a national basis to be enjoined from implementing this change in rent that they had brought about."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Can you explain to me -- the question I brought up before -- what was the difference of the elements between the recovery that the jury gave for constructive termination and for breach of contract?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "The damages awarded were precisely the same, and the judge instructed the jury that, in fact, there would be no double recovery for the -- for the dealers here, that they would only recover once. The breach of contract was pled as an alternative theory. And the difference being that under the PMPA the dealers were also awarded their attorneys’ fees and expert witness fees as well, which was a -- a number north of a million dollars."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "The problem that -- that I see here is that if in fact you are right, that the -- the franchisor -- he breached the contract in your view. Did that breach rise to a termination? Did it rise to that level? Now, it's simply a question, since he breached the contract, of what court you are going to sue in, in your view. If this isn't a termination, you sue in State court; if it is a termination, you sue in Federal court. So, why -- why wouldn't we say, well, let him sue in State court, because if the person stays on the premises, everything becomes blurred. If you require him to leave the premises, then it's clear. If you were to let him stay on the premises and also argue it's a termination, we are going to have people coming into Federal court because they think there are more damages or something, I guess, or whatever reason. There will be a whole lot of unclear cases. So it's better to have a clear line."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, again, the -- the reason that the dealers are coming to Federal court is because Congress enacted a statute to protect them --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "You are going to say they have a right to, but the other side thinks they don't. So it doesn't answer my question to just refer to the fact that you have a right to. My question is a practical question: What's the harm of sticking to the clear line that is normally there in other cases, in this case not depriving your client of a remedy at all?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor --"

  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "Just saying he goes to State court to get it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "I disagree with the Court that the client is not being deprived of a remedy. The remedy available in the statute in one part is injunctive relief. And while the dealers did not avail themselves of that in this particular case, the lesser standard and the lack of a need to show irreparable harm protects the franchisee under a Federal cause of action as distinguished from a contractual-based cause of action."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "It's a million dollars, right? That's the difference. You get attorneys’ fees and expert fees in the Federal action, and presumably you don't in the State action."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "We -- we -- we do in this case, Mr. Chief Justice. But in a case where a dealer comes to the court for relief and they have available to them the injunctive remedy, which does not require the irreparable harm component be demonstrated, it keeps the dealer in business. Certainly Congress intended to protect franchisees. They intended for competition in the marketplace to continue. And --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, you have the option, right? If you accept the idea that there’s a constructive termination under your view, even if you don't leave, I guess you have the option to stay in business or to leave at any time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "They certainly do, Your Honor. And -- and what happened here, obviously, is that the oil company imposed such onerous conditions that they expected dealers would leave. And, in fact, in Massachusetts within the time period of the elimination -- the formation of Motiva, within a 5-year period thereafter, the numbers dropped almost by 50 percent."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",

So, here's your choice, dealer: Stay there and sue in State court, and by the way, if they are charging you too much money under the contract and you are really hurting doing -- putting lions and tigers, whatever they are doing, go get an injunction in State court.

It -- the contract is terminated if your client says it's terminated. If he doesn't say it's terminated, it's not terminated. I mean, a very weird contract where you -- you’re subject to the whim of the other party as to whether the contract continues or not."

Here the dealers continued to pay the exorbitant rents that were being charged. So I would argue that the oil company was at no point in time harmed by virtue of the claim and then the proceedings that ensued."

  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, I don't know. They -- you know, if they knew that they were pulling out and -- and were claiming a termination, they might have been looking for somebody else to take over the franchise."

  {
    "speaker": "FARRAHER",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I think, as a practical matter, that would not have happened during the pendency of the litigation. So, again, to the extent that the -- an injunction had been sought, it would have helped to preserve the status quo, and in this case, again, here, the oil company was not in any way, shape, or form harmed by the dealers' pursuit of their claim because they continued to pay their rent, for those that remained in business, and those that went out of business obviously stopped. Your Honors, if I may turn to the other claim, which is also present in this case here, the claim of the non-renewal, both the government and Shell have suggested that the statute imposes some sort of a mandatory mechanism requiring the franchisor to give notice and then the dealer seeking an injunction within 90 days in order -- in connection with the non-renewal claim. I think, as a practical matter, we need to start with the proposition of what the jury found here, and the jury found that, in this case, the oil company added new terms to the lease specifically for the purposes of converting the franchise-operated stations to direct operations. They wanted the dealers out of business, and they wanted to take over operations of their stations. Had the oil company issued a notice of non-renewal when the parties didn't reach agreement on the terms of the agreement and this case had proceeded to a trial, there is no question, but that the result would have been exactly the same as the result is here. So the question we are facing is whether or not this mechanism that they have advanced as being the -- the only way, the exclusive remedy to proceed is, in fact, such, and we would argue that, in fact, it is not. Both the government and the Solicitor have conceded already that, while the statute requires notice in the normal course, that, certainly, notice can be side-stepped, and that conduct can give rise to notice. The next question then would be whether or not the dealer must seek injunctive relief as a prerequisite to maintaining a claim, and we argue that there is nothing in the language of the statute suggesting that the injunction is mandatory."

    "speech": "The theory of it is to protect the dealer, and the dealer here is faced with a company that says, we are not going to renew your lease. And they are unreasonable, and the dealers think. The statute says: Fine, don't renew it, okay? And, here, we’ll give you a really good deal, so you won't be hurt. If you really think he's wrong, go sue for an injunction. And, second, we are going to give you extra bonus damages and attorneys' fees and all that stuff. So we protected you a lot. Now, why should there be a third thing that the statute says nothing about, which nobody's ever heard of? You just stay there, and you say: I'm going to just do business every day, just like nothing happened, and I write the words under protest. I mean, why would Congress have gone to all that trouble if that's all you have to do?"

You must seek an injunction --"

They told the oil company that they were signing under protest, with a reservation of all their rights. It was the oil company that presented the leases to them on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. They said, there will be no negotiation of these terms, and you must sign, and if you don't sign, we are going to issue a notice of non-renewal. And then that pins the continuation of the dealers' business on the hopes that, even with a relaxed standard, a trial court is going to issue an injunction. And I certainly don't think that the statute or the Congress intended for the dealers to risk their businesses on the likelihood of getting the injunctive relief --"

We are dealing under a statutory scheme that Congress enacted to protect franchisees, and we need to look within the meaning of the statute as to what termination means. I would also say that, in the landlord/tenant context, while the, perhaps, outdated notion of a constructive eviction would require the tenant to leave, cases seem to suggest, in a more modern sense, that the relationship between the landlord and the tenant is more of a contractual relationship in nature and, as such, allows for the traditional remedies available under contract law, in turning -- including self-help and rescission, et cetera.

    "speech": "Thank you. I believe the debate in this case comes down to about three issues: The first is what is the relevant background principle we think Congress was looking to when it used the words “terminate,” “non-renew,” and “cancel” in the statute. We think the most analogous background principles they would have been looking to were contract law and the State franchise statutes that existed at the time Congress acted. I --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "But, Mr. Lamken, isn't it true that the statute, as a whole, expressed Congress's feeling that the common law rules were really not sufficient because, under the common law, of course, they could just non-renew because they wanted to take over the franchise themselves. And under the statute, that is not permissible. So there’s a major change that's created by the statute, which suggests, to me, that maybe they didn't want to adopt all the preexisting common law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "Right. There was a deficiency in the common law, but it was limited to one point, and that was termination and non-renewal. It wasn't that breaches of contract -- and as the government has explained, a breach of contract here is a precondition to a constructive termination claim -- were insufficiently remedied by State law. That was not the issue before Congress. The issue before Congress was that there was a contractual right to terminate at will or for trivial reasons or to non-renew for no reason or bad reasons even, and that is what Congress regulated, was terminations and non-renewals, in that sense, not breaches of contract that turned out to be really bad. The second thing is that because there was a comprehensive State remedy, there is particularly little reason to read this statute, this narrow statute, expansively, particularly given that this is an expressly preemptive -- a potentially conflict preemption statute, which could have the effect of displacing State law. When you're looking at a statute that’s narrowly looking at termination or non-renewal, you would not ordinarily expand those terms to include really bad breaches of contract, because that has the potential to displace State statutory and potentially State common law under the preemption clause. And, finally, the last piece that comes up is the problem of evasion. The issue becomes sort of, well, people can just get around this statute if there is no constructive termination cause of action. And the answer to that is: There is no problem with evasion, because everything that’s covered by constructive termination has to be a breach of contract. State law has this comprehensively covered. Increasing the price terms on an open price term? U.C.C. 2-305, under which plaintiff's recovered here, has that covered. So the -- extending the Federal statute really adds very little. And the second point is that even under the PMPA today, constructive termination has been rejected -- every -- except in the narrow area of assignments, under the theory that an assignment followed by a breach is somehow a constructive termination, a theory which I don't think we or the government thinks makes any sense. But that's where it exists. And yet there’s no record outside the area of assignment of these grand evasions by boosting up all the prices in violation of the contract. And the risk of expanding constructive termination here is it projects Federal law into deciding whether or not it's going to prohibit particular price terms, particular conditions, particular things dealing with the rent and the premises, something that Congress stayed away from and left to the States. What Congress regulated here were the narrow issues of termination and non-renewal, not the substantive content of the franchise relationship. If there are no questions, we ask that the judgment with respect to termination be reversed and the judgment with respect to non-renewal be affirmed. Thank you."
