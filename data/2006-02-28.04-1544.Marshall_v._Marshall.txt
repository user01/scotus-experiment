6 Mr. Richland.

7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND

8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9 MR. RICHLAND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11 This is a bankruptcy case, but it is a

12 bankruptcy case in which the Ninth Circuit has made --

13 come to the extraordinary conclusion that the Federal

14 bankruptcy court has no jurisdiction over the chief

15 assets of the bankruptcy estate. That asset, a -- a

16 tort cause of action, was to be the main source of the

17 payment to the creditors. And the Ninth Circuit came

18 to this conclusion because it gave a very broad

19 interpretation of the so-called probate exception to

20 Federal jurisdiction.

21 As I will explain, the Federal bankruptcy

22 jurisdiction statutes are incompatible with the concept

23 of having adopted a probate exception to Federal

24 jurisdiction, particularly to Federal bankruptcy

25 jurisdiction.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Any exception whatever.

2 MR. RICHLAND: That's correct, Your Honor.

3 There is no exception to that. The -- the statute

4 itself is structured in such a way that its

5 jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court depends on the

6 relationship of the matter to the bankruptcy estate.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: So if -- if the contention

8 in the -- in the bankruptcy proceeding is that the will

9 which has been probated by the State probate court is,

10 in fact, not the true will and that under the true

11 will, the bankruptcy estate would get money, you think

12 the bankruptcy court would -- would have jurisdiction

13 to probate the will.

14 MR. RICHLAND: Yes, Your Honor. Now, the

15 question is, of course, that's an attack on a probated

16 will, I believe, and I think that this Court's

17 jurisprudence also supports the notion that --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Well, I'm

19 willing to -- to move it back. I mean, that's --

20 that's even harder for you. But let's assume that the

21 will is in probate but has not yet been probated. Do

22 you think the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to

23 decide which will is the true will?

24 MR. RICHLAND: Well, the -- the bankruptcy

25 jurisdiction statute states that --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes or no.

2 MR. RICHLAND: The answer is yes, it does--

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right.

4 MR. RICHLAND: -- and it must have that power

5 to be able to do so because the bankruptcy jurisdiction

6 statute states that the court has jurisdiction, in rem

7 jurisdiction, exclusive in rem jurisdiction --

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What if the rem --

9 MR. RICHLAND: -- over all assets of the --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what if the rem is in

11 another court before the bankruptcy begins? What if

12 the res is within -- is in another court?

13 MR. RICHLAND: Yes, yes, Justice Ginsburg.

14 28 U.S.C., section 1334(e) states the bankruptcy court

15 shall have exclusive jurisdiction, in rem jurisdiction,

16 over the bankruptcy estate, and that has been

17 interpreted by the courts as meaning that it has

18 paramount jurisdiction in the sense that the normal in

19 custodia legis doctrine does not apply where it is a

20 bankruptcy court case.

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So even -- even if

22 property is in the custody of another court in the

23 probate proceeding and the bankruptcy proceeding comes

24 later, the bankruptcy proceeding would sweep whatever

25 assets are before the probate court into the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 bankruptcy.

2 MR. RICHLAND: That -- that is correct, Your

3 Honor, and there have been courts that have held that

4 with respect --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you want to stand on this

6 position, Mr. Richland, or do you have a lesser

7 position --

8 MR. RICHLAND: Well, it's certainly not --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that -- that might cause

10 you to win? Because --

11 (Laughter.)

12 MR. RICHLAND: Well, it certainly is not

13 necessary, of course, to -- to -- for us to prevail in

14 this case. However, I think it is an important

15 principle to interpret the -- the bankruptcy

16 jurisdiction statute, look at the language of that

17 statute, and determine what Congress intended from

18 that. And -- and I think it also is a dangerous thing

19 to get into, implying exceptions into that statute.

20 But -- but let me state this. Obviously, in

21 this case we have an action, the -- the in rem

22 jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court over the chosen

23 action, that is -- is miles away from the probate of --

24 of a will. The particular cause of action involved

25 here was an interference with an inter vivos gift. And

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 I think it's important to realize that that was

2 intended to be a gift that would be complete during the

3 lifetime of the decedent. That fact means that this

4 case really has almost nothing to do with probate or

5 probate jurisdiction.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you did file a

7 challenge to the probate of the will, didn't you, in

8 Texas?

9 MR. RICHLAND: There was a challenge filed to

10 the probate of the will originally by the -- the

11 brother of the respondent in this case, and eventually

12 yes, our client did join that some years later after it

13 was first filed. So that would have been an

14 alternative.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And wasn't the ground

16 for that that it would be inconsistent with the inter

17 vivos trust that you are asserting in the bankruptcy

18 court proceeding?

19 MR. RICHLAND: No, that was not the case,

20 Your Honor. The -- the grounds for that was the belief

21 that there had been undue influence with respect to the

22 will. But the inter vivos gift claim -- a tortious

23 interference with inter vivos gift claim -- that was

24 added only many years later in the year 2000. That was

25 3 years, 3 and a half years after that same action was

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 pending in the bankruptcy court. And the only reason

2 it was raised at that time was that respondent went to

3 the Federal court and said -- and interposed the

4 probate exception and argued at that time there is no

5 jurisdiction here. Therefore, out of an excess of

6 caution, our client went to the Texas probate court and

7 said, well, I will -- I will make this -- this claim

8 here.

9 In fact, once there was success in the

10 bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy court said, now I

11 have made a determination on that claim, our client did

12 dismiss that claim and dismissed all affirmative claims

13 with respect to the probate estate.

14 I think the important thing to realize here,

15 with respect to both this particular claim and with

16 respect to the bankruptcy jurisdiction statute in

17 particular, is that the -- that the breadth of the --

18 what that statute does is, it -- it announces that

19 rather than having jurisdictional preclusions, there

20 will be preclusions based on abstention. It has broad

21 abstention provisions in section 1334(c), and indeed

22 section 1334(c)(2), which is the mandatory abstention

23 --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: You like this -- apparently

25 you like this argument, although you say you're miles

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 away from probate. Well, if you want to get into that

2 argument, I guess the strongest argument against

3 keeping it -- for keeping it is bankruptcy

4 jurisdictional statutes shouldn't be interpreted

5 differently than diversity jurisdiction or any other

6 statute, and Markham at least recognizes that there is

7 such a thing as the probate exception and that Congress

8 implicitly adopted it, just as they did the domestic

9 relations exception. Therefore, if we are going to

10 find for you on this ground, we'd have to go back and

11 overrule that case and a lot of other water that's

12 flowed over -- under the bridge or wherever the water

13 flows.

14 (Laughter.)

15 JUSTICE BREYER: And we ought to take what's

16 given as given, whatever the true meaning of

17 ecclesiastical courts having jurisdiction over certain

18 probate matters or not in the 18th century.

19 MR. RICHLAND: Well, of course, if one looks

20 at 1334(c)(2), one sees that Congress itself

21 contemplated that there would bankruptcy jurisdiction

22 under circumstances where there was no diversity

23 jurisdiction and when there was no Federal question

24 jurisdiction. So it -- it certainly is true that

25 rolled into the whole notion of mandatory abstention is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the possibility that the bankruptcy court will have

2 before it matters over which there would be no

3 diversity jurisdiction.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you could say the same

5 thing about diversity jurisdiction, that Congress

6 contemplated that there would be diversity jurisdiction

7 where there was no bankruptcy jurisdiction and no

8 Federal question jurisdiction. I mean, I don't see

9 what that proves.

10 MR. RICHLAND: Well, excuse me, Justice

11 Scalia, but what I think it does prove is that when

12 Congress enacted in 1978 the rather comprehensive

13 change that it made to the bankruptcy statutes, that it

14 intended to exercise as broad a jurisdiction as

15 possible so that the bankruptcy courts would be able to

16 control the bankruptcy estate and make determinations

17 as to how the creditors could best be protected.

18 Let me -- let -- yes. I'm sorry.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm just saying no more so

20 than -- than when Congress enacted diversity

21 jurisdiction. It intended it to apply, you know,

22 uniformly.

23 MR. RICHLAND: To -- to apply very broadly

24 according to its terms.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. RICHLAND: And, of course, this Court in

2 -- first in Lear v. Armstrong said, yes, this applies

3 very broadly. However, there is an exception and the

4 exception is purely the probate of a will -- the

5 probate of a will and that alone. And this Court has

6 really hewn very closely to that very narrow limitation

7 since that point in time.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true.

9 MR. RICHLAND: I do think that it's

10 important, however, to realize that if one examines

11 this Court's probate exception jurisdiction over the

12 years, it has consistently determined that the -- the

13 narrowness of that exception must be confirmed, and as

14 late as the Markham case, this Court has held that --

15 that Federal courts have jurisdiction to decide all

16 kinds of issues with respect to wills, all kinds of

17 issues with respect to trusts. Certainly this Court

18 has said that it can determine questions such as how to

19 interpret the provision of a will. It has even held

20 that Federal courts can determine whether a will is

21 invalid. It can make that determination if the --

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: But none -- none of this has

23 to be done for you to win this case, does it?

24 MR. RICHLAND: You are absolutely correct.

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then I -- I wish we'd stick

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to this case.

2 MR. RICHLAND: Well, I'm happy to do that,

3 Your Honor. This case is an outlier. I believe that

4 is true. This case is so far from the potential of any

5 probate exception that, although I felt that it was

6 important to be able to explicate the -- the principles

7 involved here, I --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: You want to look moderate.

9 MR. RICHLAND: Oh --

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Does this case involve

11 anything more than the enforcement of an in personam

12 tort judgment if you are to win?

13 MR. RICHLAND: It -- it would not. That is

14 all that's involved.

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it did involve, at

16 least the bankruptcy court thought, the judgment

17 invalidating the inter vivos trust. Was that necessary

18 to the decision? Or am I -- correct me if I'm --

19 MR. RICHLAND: I -- I don't believe --

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- correct me if I'm wrong

21 about that.

22 MR. RICHLAND: That is -- that is incorrect,

23 Justice Kennedy. It did not invalidate the inter vivos

24 trust. What it held was that as part of the evidence

25 that it was considering, in terms of the intent, the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 donative intent, that one portion of that inter vivos

2 trust, an amendment to it, had been forged, but it did

3 not invalidate it. In fact, it -- it expressly held

4 that the -- the inter vivos trust is valid, and that

5 was a basis for its conclusion that, indeed, this

6 particular claim was also valid. This claim was a

7 cause of action for interference with an inter vivos

8 gift.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: I guess what you're going to

10 hear in 5-10 minutes --

11 MR. RICHLAND: Yes.

12 JUSTICE BREYER: -- you might as well deal

13 with it now --

14 MR. RICHLAND: Yes. Why not?

15 JUSTICE BREYER: -- is that the inter vivos

16 -- a -- a claim for a -- the Texas tort of interference

17 with inter vivos gift, according to Texas law, must be

18 brought at the time of the probate proceeding. And for

19 that reason, it is bound up with probate, and for that

20 reason, they didn't have jurisdiction.

21 MR. RICHLAND: Well, A -- A, we do not

22 interpret Texas law as so providing.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, let's

24 suppose you're --

25 MR. RICHLAND: But -- but assuming --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- suppose they're right

2 about their interpretation.

3 MR. RICHLAND: Assuming that they're right

4 for that -- by their interpretation, this Court has

5 repeatedly said that it -- that a -- a State court

6 cannot -- by simply assigning matters that otherwise

7 would be heard by Federal courts to the probate court,

8 that it can, in effect, shield those --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: And the strongest case for

10 you on that is?

11 MR. RICHLAND: Oh, I think Hess --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: You said this Court has

13 repeatedly said. So what --

14 MR. RICHLAND: Said it over and over, but

15 Hess v. Reynolds from 1885, which says that merely the

16 convenience of a -- a State court to, you know, assign

17 matters to -- to its probate court. That was a case in

18 which a debt --

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but this case

20 involves a lot more than convenience. It involves a

21 substantial amount of assets that is either going to

22 pass to one person under probate or is not going to be

23 available for passing to that person because of the

24 inter vivos gift. That seems to be more closely

25 related to the core probate matters.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. RICHLAND: Well in fact, Chief Justice

2 Roberts, I don't believe that's the case. Nothing

3 passed by way of probate in this case. The -- there

4 were no assets in the probate. What happened here was

5 that all of the assets -- and the record shows this,

6 and I don't believe it's -- that there is any dispute

7 here. All of the assets had passed to the respondent

8 in this case before the will and the trust were

9 actually submitted to the probate court.

10 Once again, this is a tort claim and it's a

11 tort claim only for an interference. If those assets

12 had never gone to respondent in this case, there would,

13 nevertheless, still be a good tort claim. If, for

14 example, those assets had been passed to respondent's

15 child or to another brother, the interference itself --

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Richland --

17 MR. RICHLAND: Excuse me, Justice --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what seems to me to be

19 involved here is what is not uncommon in our Federal

20 system, that is, two proceedings, both dealing with the

21 same or closely related subject matter. It is not

22 infrequent that you have parallel proceedings in

23 Federal court and State court, and then the one that

24 gets finished first -- that judgment is binding on the

25 other. And as I understand it, the probate proceeding

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 concluded first before the district judge reviewed the

2 bankruptcy judge's opinion.

3 MR. RICHLAND: Justice Ginsburg, you're quite

4 correct that issues -- that -- that the principles of

5 preclusion ordinarily would deal with the kinds of

6 issues here, and -- and we think that that -- those --

7 that should be what governs this case.

8 But I don't believe that it is correct to say

9 that the probate court judgment preceded that of the

10 bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court judgment came

11 first. A year later the probate court judgment then --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I'm -- I'm assuming

13 -- and correct me if I'm wrong about this -- that the

14 bankruptcy court makes a proposed opinion. It doesn't

15 become a binding opinion until it's affirmed by the

16 district court.

17 MR. RICHLAND: Unless it's a core matter.

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

19 MR. RICHLAND: And here we claim that it is a

20 core matter.

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if it isn't a core

22 matter. I think you lost on that in the district

23 court.

24 MR. RICHLAND: If it isn't a core matter,

25 then in any event the district court here held that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there was no preclusion, and it held it for a number of

2 reasons.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was not reviewed

4 by the Ninth Circuit.

5 MR. RICHLAND: That's correct. That was not

6 reviewed by the Ninth Circuit. But that would be the

7 -- the appropriate manner of review.

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would -- that would

9 be the -- if you -- if you're correct about the limits

10 of the probate exception, that issue would be open for

11 review by the Ninth Circuit.

12 MR. RICHLAND: It certainly would, Justice

13 Ginsburg. We agree with that.

14 And if I may reserve the rest of my time for

15 rebuttal.

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

17 MR. RICHLAND: Thank you.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Maynard.

19 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD

20 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

21 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

22 MS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

23 please the Court:

24 Two independent principles require reversal

25 of the Ninth Circuit's decision.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 First, the probate exception to Federal

2 jurisdiction is a will-specific rule and it does not

3 apply beyond the context of wills to other types of

4 will substitutes like inter vivos trusts.

5 Second, even with respect to wills, it is a

6 very narrow exception that is no bar to deciding the

7 rights to a decedent's estate, construing a will, or

8 determining the testator's intent.

9 There are only three things under this

10 Court's precedent that a Federal court cannot do. The

11 first is to probate a will, that is, to determine the

12 formal key requisites of the validity of a will;

13 second, to annul an already probated will; and three,

14 to take in rem jurisdiction over a res over which a

15 State court has already taken in rem jurisdiction. But

16 that is it, and none of those are applicable here.

17 The justifications for the probate exception

18 do not apply to will substitutes. The -- the probate

19 exception is based on the peculiar nature of a will,

20 that is, that unlike inter vivos trusts, unlike the

21 current modern will substitutes, a will is not valid --

22 it has no legal effect. This Court's opinions have

23 said that on several occasions -- unless it is

24 probated. Therefore, a will must be probated even if

25 there is no dispute about its validity before any title

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 can pass. Not so with trusts. In fact, that is the

2 whole point that people engage in the modern world

3 substitutes is to avoid the necessity to go to the

4 probate court in order to have their assets passed to

5 their heirs.

6 The second ground for this Court's probate

7 exception is a historical one based on the Court's

8 understanding of the limits of the equity courts in

9 England. Whatever the merit of that historical

10 analysis, it has no application to trusts, which have

11 always been the problems of equity.

12 The Federal Government has a strong interest

13 in the Court not expanding the Federal exception -- the

14 -- the probate exception to Federal jurisdiction,

15 particularly in the sweeping manner that the Ninth

16 Circuit has done. It is not uncommon for the tax

17 consequences of an estate planning instrument, such as

18 a trust, to turn on whether or not the trust is valid

19 or invalid. And the Congress has provided Federal

20 jurisdiction to the United States to bring its -- most

21 of its disputes in the Federal court system.

22 Secondly, more generally, Congress has

23 determined what types of disputes should be in the

24 Federal courts and has passed broad statutes providing

25 the courts with Federal jurisdiction that the courts

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 have an obligation to exercise, if it exists.

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Except if it's a will

3 -- will-specific. In other words, you -- it seems to

4 me you're in for a penny and in for a pound. You

5 recognize the existence of this exception in certain

6 cases, and then you argue against it by saying, well,

7 Congress wrote the statutes broadly. The latter

8 argument disproves your first point.

9 MS. MAYNARD: I don't believe it does, and

10 perhaps I'm -- I'm -- I wasn't making clear what my

11 argument is. The Court has adopted a very narrow

12 probate exception with respect to the probating of the

13 will and annulling a probated will, but that is it.

14 And that analysis was based on a -- the historical --

15 the Court's view of the historical limits of courts of

16 equity and therefore was an interpretation of the

17 Federal diversity statute. Under the logic of

18 Ankenbrandt, one can assume -- one may -- the Court may

19 assume that's carried forward.

20 But certainly that -- for the reasons I've

21 said, that rationale, those justifications, for that

22 narrow will rule do not apply to trusts, which have

23 always been the province of equity, and especially

24 given the questionable historical underpinnings of the

25 exception, even the narrow exception that does appear

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to exist, there's no justification for expanding that

2 beyond its current confines.

3 As this Court recognized in Ankenbrandt, the

4 lower courts had taken the -- the so-called domestic

5 relations exception beyond this Court's very narrow

6 limits, and this Court brought -- brought it back to

7 its origins. And -- and the Federal Government

8 believes that -- that the same would be appropriate

9 here with respect to the probate exception.

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Maynard, it's my

11 understanding that a lot of this law developed out of

12 the dicta in the Markham case. Do you think the dicta

13 in the Markham case was an accurate description of the

14 prior history?

15 MS. MAYNARD: It was probably not a very

16 precise history, Justice Stevens. I do think one can

17 read Markham, however, especially if one reads it in

18 the context of the cases it cites for its principles,

19 to hold what we are saying now, which is that Federal

20 courts have no jurisdiction over pure probate matters,

21 that is, no jurisdiction to probate a will. And its

22 interference language, I believe, was its statement of

23 the in rem v. in rem jurisdiction principle, which in

24 fact isn't really a probate jurisdiction principle at

25 all.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean by no

2 jurisdiction to probate a will? Could -- could -- does

3 that exclude the possibility of a bankruptcy court

4 deciding for itself where there are contested wills

5 that in its in view the -- the right -- the valid will

6 is a certain one and that, therefore, the bankruptcy

7 estate includes this fund or doesn't include this fund?

8 Is that probating the will?

9 MS. MAYNARD: The -- the United States hasn't

10 taken a position on the broader argument about whether

11 or not the --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if that isn't

13 probating a will, the exception for probating a will

14 doesn't -- doesn't amount to a hill of beans, does it?

15 MS. MAYNARD: If -- if the question you're

16 asking me is what does it mean to probate a will --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

18 MS. MAYNARD: -- the -- the probate of a will

19 requires determining that it has the appropriate formal

20 prerequisites, which in most States is appropriate

21 number of signatures that the testator was coherent,

22 competent to make a will and that there was no undue

23 influence.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and that this is --

25 that this is the -- the last will and testament and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that there is not some other one.

2 MS. MAYNARD: That's true, yes, that there's

3 no competing will.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Now, can -- can the

5 bankruptcy court determine that, that the -- that the

6 proper will and testament of this decedent is this one?

7 We're not probating it. No, no.

8 MS. MAYNARD: The --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't pretend to probate

10 it. We're just saying that this happens to be the true

11 will and testament.

12 MS. MAYNARD: It's conceivable that if that

13 determination went to a -- an element of, for example,

14 a tort claim and that the person were not -- were not

15 seeking to take under the will, it is possible. This

16 Court's precedent doesn't address that precise

17 question. The United States hasn't taken a position on

18 whether or not bankruptcy jurisdiction, ala the logic

19 in Ankenbrandt, encompasses the narrow probate

20 exception that we concede exists because it's not

21 necessary to decide this case. The -- the petitioner's

22 claim is far beyond anything that the probate exception

23 has ever applied to.

24 The respondent suggests that States have an

25 overriding interest in having one forum resolve all

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 probate-related disputes. This Court has repeatedly,

2 for over 150 years, rejected that exact proposition --

3 Justice Breyer, Payne v. Hook, Hess v. Reynolds,

4 McClellan v. Carland, which this Court cited last term

5 in Exxon Mobil -- and it was the basis of Markham's

6 reversal of the Ninth Circuit decision that the Federal

7 jurisdiction is not determined by the scope and extent

8 of the State's decisions with respect to where to send

9 its own citizens with respect to disputes that don't

10 otherwise have a basis for Federal jurisdiction. The

11 only place in this --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Maynard, you said at

13 one point it's not necessary for you to decide this,

14 but there is vast confusion in the lower courts about

15 the extent of the probate exception. And so I take it

16 that your -- what you began -- what you began with is

17 -- I wrote them down. That's it?

18 MS. MAYNARD: That's what the United States

19 believes the limit of the exception is, and the -- let

20 me be clear. The United States has a strong interest

21 in having this Court clarify the exception. That is

22 where the confusion lies in the court of appeals. That

23 is where the United States feels like its interests are

24 at risk. So although the petitioner's claim is well

25 outside the exception, the United States' interests lie

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in having the Court clear up the confusion and reject

2 the sweeping and expansive view of the probate

3 exception that the Ninth Circuit has announced.

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And in addition to

5 Markham, what other case of this Court do you think

6 spells out the proper bounds?

7 MS. MAYNARD: I -- I think the -- Waterman

8 has a -- has a good summary of the -- of the limits. I

9 think even the two cases on which the respondent

10 principally rely, Sutton and O'Callaghan, lay out the

11 proper scope of the rule. Those -- both of those cases

12 involved a claim that depended on having a will that

13 had been probated declared invalid, and that is within

14 the narrow confines of the exception. But it is a

15 will-specific rule.

16 The -- and, Justice Stevens, back to your

17 question. The one thing about Markham is that there's

18 no general interference principle, and that's where the

19 --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: You know there are a lot of

21 scholars who think that Markham is the source of most

22 of the confusion, and so that's why I was asking

23 whether you think we should -- to clear up, which

24 you're suggesting we should do, we should reexamine

25 some of that dicta or we should just stick to the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 holding.

2 MS. MAYNARD: I would -- I would -- you can

3 -- it would be helpful to -- to clarify what the Court

4 meant in Markham. I think the holding in Markham is

5 correct.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With -- with new

7 dicta of our own?

8 (Laughter.)

9 MS. MAYNARD: It will probably be necessary,

10 to -- to rule on the case, to make some holding about

11 what the scope of the exception is, Your Honor. And

12 the -- the -- but, Justice Stevens, the --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: We could just say whatever

14 its scope is it ain't this. I mean, couldn't we do

15 that?

16 MS. MAYNARD: The Court certainly could

17 resolve it that way, Your Honor.

18 But, Justice Stevens, the -- the -- Markham,

19 I do think, makes clear what interference is and is not

20 by its holding. And on page 494 of Markham, it says,

21 where the final judgment does not undertake to

22 interfere with the State court's possession, save to

23 the extent that the State court is bound by the

24 judgment to recognize the right adjudicated by the

25 Federal court. So that is not the type of interference

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that runs afoul of the rule.

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.

3 Maynard.

5 ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.

6 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7 MR. BRUNSTAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8 please the Court:

9 The probate exception exists precisely to

10 prevent what happened in this case, a Federal court

11 enjoining ongoing probate proceedings in the middle of

12 a probate trial, a Federal court determining that the

13 decedent's estate plan was invalid, a Federal court's

14 reallocation through a damage claim of the decedent's

15 assets, contrary to the value of the estate plan, a

16 Federal court's creation of a novel cause of action --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, is it -- is it

18 correct -- I just want to be sure I follow you -- that

19 they determined that the estate plan was invalid?

20 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct, Justice Stevens. At

21 petition appendix 123 to 126, the district court

22 determined that the -- that J. Howard's living trust

23 was a forgery, that there were pages that were

24 substituted --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: But this is all -- this has

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 nothing -- I mean, I -- you have the total differently

2 -- different understanding than I do of this case, and

3 I did read Judge Carter's opinion. I thought that case

4 simply held that because your clients had interfered

5 with an effort by J. Howard to give quite a few

6 millions of dollars to Vickie Marshall -- because of

7 that interference, they had committed the tort of inter

8 vivos interference with a gift, and they had to pay

9 damages.

10 Now, they said a lot of things by way of what

11 the evidence was. Indeed, they did say, as you point

12 out, that your clients forged three pages of the will.

13 But that was simply evidence of their bad intent, and

14 it did not invalidate anything in the probate

15 proceeding, as I read it.

16 Now, what have I said that's not right?

17 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer, the answer to

18 your question, I think, depends upon the fact that

19 opposing counsel has studiously avoided actually

20 revealing what his claim is. I think we have to focus

21 on the -- her exact claim. As a matter of fact and as

22 a matter of law, she did not prevail --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not interested in what

24 he said. I'm interested in what Judge Carter said --

25 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct, Your Honor.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- because that, it seems to

2 me, is -- and what is it that Judge Carter did that was

3 wrong in this respect?

4 MR. BRUNSTAD: Judge -- Judge Carter

5 understood quite clearly that in order for her claim to

6 proceed as a matter of fact and as a matter of law, he

7 had to invalidate her living trust. And let me explain

8 why that was so.

9 That was so because her claim is that J.

10 Howard intended to give her a catchall trust. The

11 argument is that Pierce blocked the catchall trust from

12 being funded by rendering the living trust irrevocable

13 in July of 1994. Judge Carter found that the catchall

14 trust was drafted in December of 1994.

15 She can only have a claim -- now, all of J.

16 Howard's assets were in the living trust. She can only

17 have a claim -- the catchall trust could only have been

18 funded or prevented from being funded if the living

19 trust was, in fact, validly rendered irrevocable. To

20 prevent -- to -- to counter that, she says, no, the

21 living trust was invalid. As a matter of fact, she can

22 have no claim unless the living trust is rendered

23 invalid. Judge Carter understood that and he expressly

24 concluded that it was a forgery.

25 Now rendering--

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't it the case

2 that she can have her claim and she can prove her

3 claim, but she may not be able to collect the judgment

4 unless the living trust is invalid? But that's not

5 what we're litigating here, is it?

6 MR. BRUNSTAD: Your Honor, as a matter of

7 law, she cannot have her claim because the two cases we

8 rely on, Neill v. Yett and Thompson v. Deloitte, the

9 two Texas cases, establish as a predicate to any

10 tortious interference claim, she must demonstrate that

11 the estate plan, the living trust, was invalid as a

12 matter of Texas law. And that is exclusively under

13 Texas law for the Texas probate court to decide.

14 Now --

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why does she have to show

16 that is invalid as distinct from showing that another

17 trust, favorable to her, was not created and it was not

18 created because of the tortious conduct of your client?

19 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because, Justice Souter, under

20 Texas law when the -- the probate court determines the

21 validity of an estate plan, it forecloses, as a matter

22 of law, all expectancies contrary to those that are

23 part of the estate plan.

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let me -- let me stop

25 you there because this is something I didn't understand

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in the brief. You speak of the Texas probate court

2 determining the validity of an estate plan.

3 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: I take it the Texas probate

5 court determined the validity of a will here.

6 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: It determined the validity

8 of -- of a pourover trust. Is that correct?

9 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Your Honor, it did.

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right.

11 MR. BRUNSTAD: The living trust.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right.

13 Isn't it the case that the two Texas

14 determinations can be respected and still, in the

15 Federal court, enter a judgment for tort liability

16 against your client?

17 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Souter, and the

18 reason why is because her cause of action is a State

19 law cause of action, and under Texas law, putting aside

20 the fact that no Texas court has ever recognized a

21 cause of action for tortious interference --

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's in -- you may be

23 right on that, but that's not what -- what we're here

24 for.

25 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct. Putting that aside,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 under Texas law -- and the Deloitte case and the Neill

2 v. Yett case conclusively established this, and there's

3 no contrary decisions in Texas -- that once the probate

4 court determines an estate plan is valid, it

5 conclusively determines the universe of persons with

6 legitimate expectancies.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: But when you speak of estate

8 plan, you are -- you seem to be talking in global

9 terms; i.e., that there could have been no other

10 disposition of assets by the decedent or on behalf of

11 the decedent except those which the Texas court is

12 recognizing, the trust, the will. Is that what the

13 Texas court does, or does the Texas court say, the will

14 is good, the trust is good?

15 MR. BRUNSTAD: The Texas courts have

16 conveniently described for us Justice -- Justice Souter

17 --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, is it

19 preclusive of everything else? That's what I'm getting

20 at.

21 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, exactly so, Justice

22 Souter. And in the Thompson case itself, the -- the

23 Texas court says, when the probate court admitted the

24 1989 will to probate, it necessarily found that Mr.

25 Thompson signed the will with testamentary capacity and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that it reflected his intent, was not the result of

2 coercion or under influence, and was valid. And the

3 court continued, as a matter of law, the final probate

4 court judgment bars any claim that appellees tortiously

5 interfered with any inheritance--

6 JUSTICE BREYER: That -- that sounds to

7 me like a matter of preemption, but -- but -- or not

8 preemption but, you know, res judicata.

9 But just out of curiosity or -- because I

10 think it is relevant, did the Texas probate court have

11 in front of it the documents among the lawyers that the

12 district judge, Judge Carter, relied upon in showing

13 that there was an intent to create the catchall trust?

14 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Breyer. Everything

15 --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: It had all those documents.

17 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Breyer.

18 Everything the district court had and more was examined,

19 adjudicated in the 5-and-a-half-month jury trial in the

20 Texas probate court exhaustively.

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why isn't that, as

22 Justice Breyer prefaced his question, an issue of

23 preclusion rather than, as you frame it, an issue of

24 jurisdiction?

25 MR. BRUNSTAD: Chief Justice Roberts, the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 probate exception has always been jurisdictional, and

2 the reason why it can't be subsumed by res judicata or

3 collateral estoppel -- we believe we win on those

4 grounds, but the reason why the probate exception can't

5 be subsumed within those doctrines is because it

6 applies even before you have a State court judgment.

7 It prevents a Federal court from determining an estate

8 plan from being invalidated --

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should it? The

10 probate exception is court-created. Congress passed no

11 law that said it. Congress gave the Federal courts

12 jurisdiction in certain categories of cases and

13 expected them to exercise that jurisdiction. Since our

14 jurisdiction is statutory and the probate exception was

15 made up by the courts, shouldn't we interpret it as

16 narrowly as possible, perhaps even do away with it

17 because it lacks any statutory basis?

18 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Ginsburg, the probate

19 exception, like the domestic relations exception, is

20 best conceived as a presumption that when Congress

21 establishes a font of Federal jurisdiction, it does not

22 intend that jurisdiction to be extended to interfere

23 with probate proceedings. That is properly a

24 jurisdictional doctrine in this case because it is

25 never appropriate for a bankruptcy court to invalidate

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 or validate a will and -- or an estate plan. And that

2 is a necessary element of Vickie's claim.

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you say -- you say an

4 -- an estate plan. Most people would think insurance

5 policies are part of their estate plan, and if it's

6 alleged that there was a fraudulent alteration of the

7 beneficiary designation in the insurance policies, is

8 that within the Texas probate court jurisdiction?

9 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Kennedy, no. Here we

10 have -- when I say estate plan, I mean the living trust

11 and the will operating together.

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there's -- there's a

13 further irony here in that revocable trusts are always

14 promoted on the grounds that it keeps us out of

15 probate. And now you're -- you're insisting that it

16 has to be in probate.

17 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Justice Kennedy, the

18 living trust here did two things that a will does. It

19 provided for the succession of J. Howard's property

20 upon his death, and it provided for the payment of his

21 last -- last illness expenses and his -- his debts. It

22 is quintessentially a will substitute in the sense that

23 it also provides for the succession of his property.

24 In this case --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it isn't probated.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 That's -- it is, indeed, a will substitute. The whole

2 purpose of doing it is to avoid probate.

3 MR. BRUNSTAD: But in this case, Justice

4 Scalia, the will and the -- the living trust acted

5 together. The probate court had exclusive jurisdiction

6 over both of them and the challenges to them. Vickie

7 challenged the living trust, even before J. Howard

8 died. Those proceedings continued on in the probate

9 court, and --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but as Justice Breyer

11 indicated, can't you just, for purposes of

12 understanding the cause of action as asserted by Vickie

13 Marshall here, just say, we will assume the trust is

14 valid, we will assume the will is valid? All we're

15 saying was that there's a tort and he's going to be

16 liable to us in tort.

17 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because, Justice Kennedy,

18 again, a critical element of her cause of action is

19 the invalidity of the trust as a matter of fact and

20 law.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why? Why? That is to

22 say, what the finding is, is that there was a different

23 matter, a catchall trust, and he told the lawyers, go

24 draw it up so I can give gifts to her, the increase in

25 the value of my property during the 13 months we're

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 married, do it, and they never did it. Now, that seems

2 to have nothing whatsoever to do with the GRAT trust or

3 with the will. It just happens that those are

4 evidentiary, what went on there, of what likely

5 happened with the catchall trust.

6 So I don't see why those are necessary. I

7 don't see why they're more than evidentiary, and I

8 don't see whether or not those are barred, those

9 particular facts have anything to do with this, as far

10 as jurisdiction is concerned.

11 Now, explain to me why I'm wrong.

12 MR. BRUNSTAD: Certainly, Justice Breyer.

13 First of all, Texas has the right to prescribe the

14 elements of its own causes of action, and under Texas

15 law, her cause of action depends upon two critical

16 things, a legitimate expectancy J. Howard intended to

17 do this for her, and the second, tortious conduct of

18 some kind. Her claim -- she tries to meet those two

19 critical elements by showing two things. One, that J.

20 Howard intended to give me this -- this gift in the

21 form of this -- this trust, and that it was tortiously

22 interfered with because the living trust was rendered

23 irrevocable.

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's just one of the

25 things.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BRUNSTAD: But it's --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Among other things that went

3 on were they hired private detectives to go after

4 her, to keep her from the bed. I mean, you've read that

5 opinion and there are like about 30 things in there. And

6 I grant you that one of those things is the fact that

7 three pages of the living trust, according to the judge,

8 were created after the event of that trust and slipped

9 in without his knowledge. I mean, it's quite a story.

10 MR. BRUNSTAD: Of course, Your Honor --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and so I -- but as I

12 read it, there were many, many, many things involved

13 here, and this is just one of them. So how can Texas

14 say that you have to prove this particular one as -- as

15 opposed to proving a lot of others?

16 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer, of course, as

17 an aside, we went to great pains in the Ninth Circuit

18 to demonstrate why all those findings were clearly

19 erroneous and not based on the evidence.

20 But assuming them to be so, which we dispute,

21 again, looking at her claim, that is the critical

22 element of her claim. If, in fact, there -- if, in

23 fact, the living trust was made revocable, then at any

24 point in time, he could have funded, if -- if he had it

25 as revocable until his death, he could have funded her

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 gift that she alleges and she would have no damage

2 claim. It is because of the trust becoming irrevocable

3 that he was prevented from doing it. That is her

4 claim.

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but her claim is assume

6 it's been made irrevocable. I just want some money

7 from this guy.

8 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's all she's saying, as

10 I understand it. She -- she can -- as I understand her

11 cause of action, it can proceed on the assumption the

12 will is valid, the -- the trust is valid. Just give me

13 the money that I would have had.

14 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Souter, as a matter of

15 Texas law, she cannot establish a legitimate

16 expectancy. Again, once the probate court -- and the

17 probate court alone has the right to determine the

18 validity of an estate plan. Once the probate court has

19 determined that as a matter of Texas law, all claims

20 about expectancies contrary to those provided in the --

21 in the plan are foreclosed. That's the Thompson case

22 and the Neill case.

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're arguing a

24 preclusion question, and if the Ninth Circuit thought

25 it had jurisdiction, it could have tested what you say

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 about Texas law. There's no finding in this record of

2 what Texas law is other than what you have just told

3 us, and perhaps you're right and perhaps you're not.

4 But the Ninth Circuit said the Federal door is closed

5 to this probate exception, and that's what we're here

6 to decide.

7 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Ginsburg, preclusion

8 will also not work. Res judicata and collateral

9 estoppel will also not work because the parties in the

10 Federal proceeding are merely a subset of the parties

11 in the probate court. The probate court's judgment is

12 unique because it has a binding-against-the-world

13 effect. Federal courts cannot pull chunks of the

14 critical issues into the Federal court because doing

15 so creates an inconsistency of judgments potentially.

16 Where the Federal court only has part of the parties

17 before it, the Federal court has all -- the probate

18 court has all the parties before it. The probate

19 court's judgment is binding against the world --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think it -- it may be

21 that there's another side to that story. For example,

22 I think the bankruptcy court was heard from first.

23 Arguably, that's binding on the Texas court. Whether

24 the bankruptcy court was right or wrong, it would get

25 full faith and credit. That's one argument.

1 Another is perhaps you can explain to me how

2 this all started because I thought that it was a claim

3 made against her in the bankruptcy court for

4 defamation. Then the claim that she asserts is a

5 compulsory counterclaim. She has to make it there or

6 she'll lose it.

7 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Ginsburg, the

8 claim was not a compulsory counterclaim. The action

9 which was -- that Pierce commenced in the -- in the

10 bankruptcy court was merely to ask the bankruptcy court

11 to decide that if he had a debt against -- if he had a

12 claim against her she owed him money, it would be

13 nondischargeable in bankruptcy. She then used that

14 opportunity to pursue this tortious interference claim

15 against Pierce that she was already pursuing in the

16 probate court. So because there was a prior pending

17 proceeding where she had made the claim --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I didn't understand

19 the pleading to say if I have a claim, it would be

20 nondischargeable. I thought he made a claim. He made

21 -- filed a claim for defamation in the bankruptcy

22 proceeding.

23 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Ginsburg, Pierce did

24 not ask the bankruptcy court to decide the claim. He

25 only -- he only asked for the bankruptcy court to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 decide whether it was nondischargeable or not.

2 But even so -- even so, I think it's

3 important to recognize --

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He would have to say I

5 have a claim because the bankruptcy court is not going

6 to decide a hypothetical if he has a claim. He has to

7 at least assert I have a claim.

8 MR. BRUNSTAD: But bankruptcy judges do that,

9 Justice Ginsburg. They decide only the

10 nondischargeability aspect of claims rather than the

11 claims themselves.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It has to be a real claim.

13 It can't be if I have a claim.

14 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Ginsburg, because

15 the nondischargeability jurisdiction in bankruptcy is

16 unique. You allow the claim to be determined in a

17 proper court of competent jurisdiction, and then the

18 bankruptcy court decides whether it's nondischargeable

19 or not. That's how it should proceed particularly

20 where, as here, her claim requires, as -- in order for

21 it to -- to be valid, to determine the validity or

22 nonvalidity of J. Howard's estate plan.

23 Now, the United States --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I don't -- I

25 don't see how the interference with the probate court

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that you're articulating is any greater than the

2 interference in Markham. In Markham, it was a decision

3 by a Federal court that these claimants were not

4 going to claim under the will. Why is -- isn't that

5 even greater than the interference you're complaining

6 of?

7 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Chief Justice Roberts.

8 You can readily divide the Court's precedents into two

9 categories, those where there was impermissible

10 interference and therefore no jurisdiction, and those

11 where there isn't. On the impermissible interference

12 side, you have a case like Federal court cannot

13 determine the validity of an estate plan, Armstrong,

14 Gaines v. Chew. A Federal -- a Federal court cannot

15 determine --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was it an estate plan or a

17 will?

18 MR. BRUNSTAD: In Sutton --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you -- you -- you're

20 stretching the probate concept from determining whether

21 the will is valid or invalid and who inherits under the

22 will to also determining what goes into the probate

23 estate, that is, the insurance policies, the trust, and

24 so forth. That to me is -- is something quite

25 different from probating a will.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Scalia, the probate

2 exception protects the integrity of the succession

3 process. If the documents you're looking at deal with

4 the succession of the property, as the living trust and

5 will do in this case, it is encompassed within the

6 probate exception in the Sutton case --

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I don't -- I don't see

8 your -- your logic there. Of course, it protects the

9 succession process, but it does not follow that

10 everything that implicates a succession process falls

11 within the probate exception.

12 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct. Correct, Justice

13 Souter. But here the succession was determined under

14 the living trust, and in Sutton v. English, that's

15 exactly the same scenario. Moses Hubbard left a --

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if there had been a

17 joint bank account, the succession would have been

18 determined based on the validity of the joint bank

19 account, and that certainly wouldn't have fallen within

20 the probate exception.

21 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because the joint -- where you

22 have the equivalent of tenancies in the entirety, I'd

23 say that's a separate issue.

24 Here, however, the living trust performed all

25 the functions of a traditional will, unlike a joint

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 bank account. In the Sutton case, you had both a will

2 and a trust, just like in this case. There, Moses

3 Hubbard left a will and a trust. Mary Jane Hubbard

4 enjoyed the benefits of the trust for her life.

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Does -- does Texas law

6 provide that a -- a living trust must be executed and

7 administered with the formalities of a will?

8 MR. BRUNSTAD: Not quite the same, Justice

9 Souter. Not quite the same.

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then you have to get

11 beyond our probate exception cases to cover the living

12 trust.

13 MR. BRUNSTAD: But in Sutton v. English,

14 there was both a will and a trust, exactly the same as

15 here. The plaintiffs were just going after the

16 property. We just want the assets. We're saying we're

17 not touching the trust and the will. This Court held

18 -- this Court held, wait a minute. Only the Texas

19 probate courts may determine whether these instruments

20 are valid or not.

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but she's not --

22 she's not even going after the assets in this case.

23 She's asserting an in personam claim against the

24 individual. Correct?

25 MR. BRUNSTAD: She is, but that's exactly the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 same as Broderick's Will, Chief Justice Roberts, an in

2 personam claim against the beneficiaries of the

3 allegedly invalid estate plan to impose a constructive

4 trust on them to get the money. No matter how you dice

5 it or slice it in this case, she is doing an end run

6 around the probate proceeding.

7 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't think they're going

8 to impose a constructive trust, are they? All -- all

9 they're going to say is pay her the money.

10 MR. BRUNSTAD: But why are they going to say

11 pay her the money?

12 JUSTICE BREYER: They're going to say it

13 because they make a finding that through a whole

14 variety of various devices, all of which were listed,

15 that J. Howard, who wanted to give her money through

16 something called the catchall trust was prevented in

17 about 15 ways. And even if you're right that there's a

18 Texas finding that those three pages weren't slipped

19 in, well, how do we know? Maybe it was a valid GRAT

20 trust, but if only they hadn't tried to isolate J.

21 Howard from contact with her, J. Howard would have

22 figured out what had happened before he died and he

23 would have told his lawyers, hey, cut this out. Do

24 what I want. Revoke it. But all that is just

25 hypothetical. I'm just using that to show you why I

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 think this is evidentiary not a matter of what the

2 elements of the crime are -- or the elements of the

3 tort are.

4 MR. BRUNSTAD: What's not evidentiary,

5 Justice Breyer, is the fact that in order to prove a

6 legitimate expectancy, she must establish that the

7 validated estate plan is in fact invalid. And under

8 Texas law, that can only be done in the probate court.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: What's the cite on that that

10 I -- that I need for --

11 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, in our brief we cite to

12 many, many cases, Your Honor. I would -- I would

13 specifically refer you to --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying you can't

15 bring an inter vivos trust -- an inter vivos --

16 interference with an inter vivos gift action in Texas

17 unless you show that a will, for example, is invalid.

18 MR. BRUNSTAD: That's correct, Your Honor,

19 and those are the Neill v. Yett and the Thompson --

20 Thompson v. Deloitte cases, which I was reading to

21 before. And the Court said as a matter of law, the

22 final probate court judgment bars any claim that

23 appellees tortiously interfered with any inheritance

24 expectancy because, in light of the final invalid

25 probate court judgment, appellant has --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- but that's res

2 judicata. I mean, that -- that isn't necessarily a --

3 an application of -- of any probate exception.

4 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Scalia, it is not res

5 judicata for the following reason. Not only may a

6 Federal court not determine the validity or invalidity

7 after the probate court, it may not do so before the

8 probate court has had a chance --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: You say that, but that case

10 doesn't say that.

11 MR. BRUNSTAD: That case doesn't say that.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what case do you

13 have that says that?

14 MR. BRUNSTAD: The cases -- there is no

15 specific case where someone has tried to litigate a

16 tortious interference claim in Federal court before the

17 probate court has had -- has had its say.

18 Under Texas law, however, because of the

19 preclusive effect of that determination, Vickie would

20 be able to come to the probate court and say, look, J.

21 Howard intended to give me this. It's a finding of

22 intent. That's preclusive on the probate court. The

23 probate court would be perhaps prohibited from saying,

24 oh, I can't determine under -- that the valid estate

25 plan gives the intent to somebody else.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the mere fact that you

2 have jurisdiction to say something does not mean that

3 if -- if some other court says the same thing first,

4 you won't be bound by that.

5 MR. BRUNSTAD: The problem, though, Justice

6 Scalia, is that the probate court is supposed to make

7 that finding in a judgment good against the world. But

8 all of a sudden, part of the world who has done an end

9 run around the probate proceeding has now gone to some

10 other court for a critical determination of fact that

11 the probate court must decide and always must decide in

12 determining the validity of an estate plan --

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you are suggesting

14 an extraordinary setup with a State court being able to

15 preclude other courts from dealing with related, not

16 identical matters, and that's just not the way our

17 system works. You can bring duplicative proceedings in

18 different courts. One will finish first and that will

19 bind the others. But I -- I never heard of a State

20 court being able to say, because we are a probate

21 court, that you -- you couldn't bring a tort case

22 someplace else.

23 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Ginsburg --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the only court

25 I've heard of that can do that is the Federal

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 bankruptcy court.

2 MR. BRUNSTAD: Just as a Federal bankruptcy

3 court is in rem and executes and enters some judgments

4 good against the world with respect to some issues, a

5 probate court does the same thing. You have exactly

6 the same reason why the probate court does it as in the

7 bankruptcy court.

8 Now, this Court has recognized in Tilt v.

9 Kelsey, for example, that the State has a sovereign

10 interest in deciding the scope of its probate procedure

11 that the State may, this Court said in Broderick's

12 Will, provide for the probate court to enter a judgment

13 good against the world, whether the person was a party

14 to the proceeding or not. If a -- if a Federal court

15 can predetermine --

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the definition of

17 an in rem judgment, but she's suing for an in personam

18 judgment an individual, not an estate, just for a plain

19 old money judgment.

20 MR. BRUNSTAD: But in a race to judgment,

21 Your Honor, if the Federal court gets to decide this

22 critical issue of intent before the probate court, it

23 preempts the probate court from doing its core probate

24 function of validating or invalidating an estate plan.

25 That would render our probate system unworkable. That

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 is why --

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Brunstad --

3 MR. BRUNSTAD: -- this is a jurisdictional

4 doctrine.

5 Yes, Justice Stevens.

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you two

7 questions? First, if there were no such animal as the

8 probate exception, would there have been bankruptcy

9 court jurisdiction over your claim?

10 MR. BRUNSTAD: We argue no, Justice Stevens,

11 because as we argued in the Ninth Circuit, there was

12 not even bankruptcy jurisdiction because the other side

13 never responded to our argument that the outcome of

14 this case would not result in any money going to

15 creditors of her estate.

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: So your -- you would

17 prevail even if there were no probate exception in your

18 view.

19 MR. BRUNSTAD: That's our argument. The

20 Ninth Circuit did not address that ground, Your Honor.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: And my -- my second

22 question is I noticed you quoted from a Minnesota Law

23 Review about 250 cases, and the -- your opponent

24 pointed out that the -- the next sentence of the

25 article said the holdings don't support the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 generalization. And I would just like to ask you,

2 apart from the Markham case, what is the case -- what

3 holding of a case lends the greatest support to your

4 probate exception argument.

5 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Stevens, I think that

6 the Sutton case is the closest. The next closest is

7 Broderick's Will. Sutton again involved both a trust

8 and a will and was a construction of Texas law, which

9 we say the Court has already decided in Sutton, and

10 Texas law, which is undisputed, has the effects which

11 we say it has in the brief. They did not contest,

12 Justice Ginsburg, our construction or interpretation of

13 Texas law.

14 I think also that the Court's decisions in

15 Tarver and Fouvergne and also Ellis and O'Callaghan --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not asking you to rank

17 them. I don't want a list of cases that have a lot of

18 dicta because some of these cases went off on laches,

19 some went off a lot of different grounds than purely --

20 than -- some of them don't even mention probate.

21 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Stevens, I think that

22 it's -- it would be helpful if I could give you a

23 thumbnail sketch breaking down, what I was trying to do

24 earlier, between those where there's impermissible

25 interference and those where there's not impermissible

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 interference. The United States' characterization I

2 think is incorrect.

3 For example, again, this Court has determined

4 there's no jurisdiction for a Federal court to

5 determine the validity of an instrument. That's the

6 first case in Armstrong v. Lear and also Gaines v.

7 Chew.

8 Also, this Court has determined there's no

9 Federal jurisdiction to determine the invalidity of an

10 estate plan. That's Tarver, Fouvergne, and

11 O'Callaghan, Broderick's Will, Sutton, and Ellis.

12 This Court has determined that Federal courts

13 do not have jurisdiction to administer the probate

14 estate. That's Byers v. McAuley.

15 This Court has determined that there is no

16 Federal jurisdiction to take possession of the assets

17 in the probate court. That is also Broderick's Will.

18 I'm sorry. That is Byers v. McAuley.

19 This Court has determined one may not impose

20 a constructive trust on the beneficiaries as, in

21 essence, a way to get property to them. That's

22 Broderick's Will and Sutton.

23 This Court has determined there's no

24 jurisdiction to recover property from the beneficiary

25 because of an alleged invalidity of a will. That's --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that's the Ellis case.

2 This Court has determined there's no

3 jurisdiction for the Federal court to direct an

4 accounting from the administrator. That's the Waterman

5 case.

6 This Court has determined there's no

7 jurisdiction to interfere with the State court's

8 possession of the assets, again Waterman, Williams,

9 Yonley, and Borer.

10 Now, no jurisdiction. It's always been a

11 jurisdictional doctrine.

12 And for the same reasons this Court refused

13 to recharacterize the -- the domestic relations

14 exception as a abstention doctrine, the Court should

15 also decline to do so here under the probate exception.

16 Now, the other side of the schema is, when is

17 it permissible for a Federal court to undertake a

18 probate-related matter? Well, if the State allows the

19 claim, particular claim, to be brought outside its

20 exclusive probate system, then Federal courts may

21 entertain jurisdiction as well.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: By the way, in Texas if you

23 have to go through all this probate stuff and

24 everything, and they want to claim 15 years ago my

25 mother gave a ring to my cousin who stole it, is that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 precluded to bring that tort action when the person

2 who, you know, was supposed to get it finds out about

3 it?

4 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer, all claims of

5 incomplete gift, which Vickie's claim is here, compete

6 with an estate plan.

7 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so, in other words, if

8 it -- when the guy is 2 years -- 15 years old, he gives

9 a ring to somebody, and now he dies at age 93, and when

10 they find out about that incomplete gift at age 15,

11 nobody can bring a lawsuit anymore. You have to go to

12 the probate court.

13 MR. BRUNSTAD: If in fact the ring passed

14 under his valid estate plan, yes. Because the ring

15 passed under the valid estate plan, you have to

16 overturn the estate plan before you say the property

17 goes somewhere else.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

19 MR. BRUNSTAD: Thank you, Your Honor.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Richland, you

21 have 4 minutes remaining.

22 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND

23 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

24 MR. RICHLAND: Thank you, Your Honor.

25 Justice Breyer, to answer your question about

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 whether the Texas court had all of the material before

2 it that was before the bankruptcy court, the answer to

3 that can be seen at page 45 of the appendix where the

4 district court judge says that there were 400 boxes of

5 documents.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but did those documents

7 -- did those boxes contain the key documents --

8 MR. RICHLAND: They did.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- about the catchall trust?

10 MR. RICHLAND: They did. They contained the

11 -- perhaps the most key documents, which were the

12 billing records that showed that that trust was

13 actually drafted. The trust, of course, never saw the

14 light of day, but those billing records reflected that.

15 And none of that was in front of the Texas probate

16 court.

17 In addition, Justice Breyer, you mentioned

18 that there were a number of other instances of tortious

19 misconduct that were found by Justice Carter, in

20 addition to the forging of the -- of the irrevocability

21 point. Indeed, Justice Carter found that there were

22 massive transfers of J. Howard's assets to Pierce

23 Marshall in his last days, and those asset transfers

24 were made in exchange for notes that were payable years

25 in the future. This was after J. Howard had been

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

56

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 diagnosed with terminal cancer, after he had had a

2 heart attack. Annuities were used to pay for those as

3 well. So that he was essentially stripped of all of

4 his assets by the time he was dead. There was -- there

5 were no assets in the probate estate at that time.

6 Justice Ginsburg, I would refer you to

7 appendix page 42 where the -- the district court

8 indicates that both a proof of claim and an adversary

9 complaint were first filed by Pierce Marshall in the

10 bankruptcy court, and that is, indeed, what caused,

11 several months later, the compulsory counterclaim to be

12 filed in a response.

13 Mr. Brunstad indicated that what happened

14 here was that while the claim was pending in Texas, it

15 was then brought to the bankruptcy court presumably

16 because there was some dissatisfaction on Ms.

17 Marshall's part as to how the Texas probate court was

18 going. In fact, page 1 of our reply brief details very

19 specifically the fact that the first time that the

20 tortious interference with gift claim was made was in

21 the bankruptcy court as the compulsory counterclaim.

22 And I would just conclude by stating that the

23 cause of action that was at issue here was really a

24 very common one. It's the -- not in and of itself, but

25 it's common to make a claim against the estate in debt

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

57

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 or that a gift was given, and that may, indeed,

2 diminish the estate that is eventually passed. But

3 that doesn't invalidate any of the estate planning

4 documents. It simply means that something that might

5 otherwise have been within the estate was not included

6 in the estate.

7 That's really all that happened here. The

8 claim was for tortious interference with gift. That,

9 indeed, may have diminished the amount or may not have

10 since J. Howard was actually quite an active man at the

11 time that he made this -- this gift or intended to make

12 the gift, and was still doing business deals. He may

13 have increased his -- his assets enormously at that

14 point in time.

15 But in any event, what it certainly does not

16 do is, it does not invalidate an estate plan. It does

17 not invalidate a will, and it certainly didn't

18 invalidate the trust or the will in this case.

19 If there are any further questions, I'd be

20 happy to answer them.

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

22 MR. RICHLAND: Thank you.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is

24 submitted.
