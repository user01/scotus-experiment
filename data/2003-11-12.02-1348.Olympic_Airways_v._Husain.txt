1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument 4 next in No. 02-1348, Olympic Airways v. Rubina Husain. 5 Mr. Harakas. Am I pronouncing your name 6 correctly? 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. HARAKAS 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. HARAKAS: Yes, Your Honor. 10 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 11 Over 70 years ago, the drafters of the Warsaw 12 Convention created a treaty which set forth the 13 circumstances under which air carrier liability should be 14 created in the event of passenger injury or death. The 15 legal regime they created recognized there's circumstances 16 where the passenger should be entitled to a cause of 17 action, but it also expressly recognized the need to limit 18 that liability and set forth certain conditions when that 19 limited liability would apply. Article 17 of the Warsaw 20 Convention creates a presumption of liability but only 21 when three conditions precedent are satisfied. 22 One, there has to be an accident in which the 23 passenger suffers a bodily injury or dies and the accident 24 took place on board the aircraft or during the course of 25 embarking or disembarking.

1 The issue before the Court here today -- we're 2 dealing with the accident condition precedent. Was that 3 satisfied in this case? 4 Of course, the -- the Court in Saks in 1985 5 specifically addressed the issue of what is an accident, 6 and the Court defined an accident as an unusual and 7 unexpected event that's external to the passenger. 8 Of a particular importance to this case is where 9 the Court declined to extend the accident and encompass an 10 injury that results from the passenger's own internal 11 condition and -- and in response to the normal and 12 expected operations of the aircraft. 13 Thus, until recently, the courts have held that 14 injuries arising out of the passenger's preexisting 15 medical conditions do not satisfy the accident condition 16 precedent even if there were allegations of air carrier 17 negligence. 18 QUESTION: I take it you don't take the position 19 that -- that, let's say, any death resulting in part as a 20 result of one, but not the only, cause of the preexisting 21 conditions is thereby excluded from the -- the class of 22 liability. 23 MR. HARAKAS: I think you have -- Justice -24 QUESTION: Every -- in other words, having a 25 heart condition does not immunize Olympic Airlines against
4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 liability if somebody dies of a heart attack per se. 2 You're not taking that position. 3 MR. HARAKAS: Our position is that if somebody 4 is on board an aircraft and they die of a heart attack, 5 that is -- that is not an -- that's a -- the passenger's 6 own internal reaction and it just happened to be -- the 7 passengers happened to be on board the aircraft. 8 QUESTION: Sure, if -- if they're simply sitting 9 in the seat and nothing unusual happens and they have a 10 heart attack and die, sure, there's no liability. But if 11 there are other conditions -- and the argument here is 12 that there are other conditions -- and the heart attack 13 was merely a contributing cause -- it was a condition upon 14 which those other conditions acted -- that does not -- the 15 existence of the heart condition does not immunize Olympic 16 Airlines against liability. That's -- I don't think 17 that's your argument, is it? 18 MR. HARAKAS: Well, no. What the argument is -19 and in this case here, you have to look to what is the 20 injury-producing event? The injury-producing event 21 here -22 QUESTION: And -- and they say the injury23 producing event is -- or one of the -- the analyses is the 24 unexpected refusal of the airline personnel to allow this 25 individual to get moved into a smoke-free zone. And that
5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 unusual and unexpected event, combined with the smoke and 2 the heart condition, caused the death. But it was the 3 unexpected refusal to remove from a smoke zone that is the 4 unexpected event or occurrence that is the accident. What 5 is your answer to that? 6 MR. HARAKAS: I respectfully disagree with the 7 characterization, which was adopted by the court below, in 8 that in this case you have to -- you -- you can't just 9 simply look to the fact that you had the flight attendant 10 saying we're not going to move you. He was assigned a 11 non-smoking seat. He -12 QUESTION: He was assigned a non-smoking seat 13 which happened to be in a zone with smoke. 14 MR. HARAKAS: Well, in -- on board any aircraft, 15 when smoking is allowed, you have ambient cigarette smoke 16 throughout the aircraft, and in this case you have to look 17 to -- it can't be disputed that this passenger reacted to 18 the cigarette smoke and the injury-producing event 19 indirect -20 QUESTION: But less in -- less in row 15 than in 21 row 48. 22 MR. HARAKAS: That's -- that's correct, Justice 23 Ginsburg. However, when you have -- when you -- in any 24 aircraft when you -- when they used to allow smoking on 25 the aircraft, as at this time, you could be 10 rows away
6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 and you would still be exposed to that ambient cigarette 2 smoke. 3 But the point we have to look to is with respect 4 to the Warsaw Convention is what type of liability did 5 they want to create. You know, when we get into issues of 6 straying away from the direct cause -- because when we 7 look to almost every single Warsaw Convention accident 8 case, the focus has always been on what is that direct 9 injury-producing event. When we start inserting common 10 law concepts of -11 QUESTION: Well, you say direct, are -- are you 12 trying to make the -- the act omission distinction? 13 MR. HARAKAS: Well, the act and -- in one 14 respect, but -- but in the broader sense, you have to look 15 to is what has always been the event the courts have 16 looked to, what did the drafters intend the event -- the 17 -- the cause to be? It's not -- I don't think it's proper 18 to inject full-blown common law notions of proximate 19 causation. 20 QUESTION: No -- no one is -- no one is making 21 the common -- I don't think is making the common law 22 argument here. They're saying it was unexpected as a 23 matter of fact that somebody who wanted a -- a smokeless 24 seat, who found there was smoke in the area of the seat 25 and who was asked to be moved, would be refused by the
7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 airline. That is the unexpected event. 2 MR. HARAKAS: But -- but that's what courts have 3 done after the Supreme Court's decision here by the Court 4 in Tseng because at that time, before Tseng, courts used 5 to find that it didn't matter whether you had allegations 6 of true negligence because we do have to look to -7 QUESTION: The -- the point is the allegations 8 are not of negligence, which is a legal and normative 9 conclusion. 10 MR. HARAKAS: Yes. 11 QUESTION: The allegation is simply, as a matter 12 of fact, it is not to be expected that a stewardess would 13 stand there and say, no, you can't move him. Whether it 14 was negligent or not negligent, it simply was unexpected 15 as a matter of fact, and they're saying that satisfies the 16 unexpected event. 17 MR. HARAKAS: I -- I disagree. I don't think 18 that satisfies the unexpected event. 19 QUESTION: Well, it could and it is different 20 from ordinary negligence. I mean, it is conceivable at 21 least that to have an airline stewardess say no when the 22 policy of the airline and the standard generally is to the 23 contrary and to say, no, I will not consider moving you 24 even though there were seats further away from the smoke 25 origin.

1 MR. HARAKAS: I don't believe in the -- for 2 purposes of the article 17 accident analysis, you -- you 3 -- your -- you should or should be allowed or it's proper 4 to go beyond looking to asking what is that injury5 producing event. 6 In this instance here, we have to remember too 7 that, yes, there were three requests to be moved. 8 However, the passenger himself never asked to be moved. 9 It was always through his wife. He was a doctor. He knew 10 his own condition. I mean, we can all get into the whole 11 reasonableness issue, but what happened -12 QUESTION: Which -- which is a matter of 13 defense. 14 QUESTION: Yes. 15 MR. HARAKAS: Yes, it's a matter of defense. 16 QUESTION: But Justice O'Connor's question and 17 my question is -- is the question that goes to whether you 18 get into court to defend. And you're -- you're giving us 19 a -- an argument that, in effect, we weren't negligent. 20 MR. HARAKAS: No. 21 QUESTION: But our questions were wasn't it 22 unexpected in fact that somebody would be in the position 23 that this passenger was in. 24 MR. HARAKAS: I don't -- well, I think that's 25 where the courts below and where you get -- where you can
9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 cross the lines and confuse the concepts of negligence and 2 causation in this case because here you could say was it 3 unusual, unexpected for a -- for a -- when a passenger 4 makes a request to be moved. In a certain sense, yes, you 5 could say that it was -- it could unusual, unexpected, but 6 I think you have to come back to is but is that the 7 injury-producing event. And that's what the courts look 8 to. 9 QUESTION: Were there other seats available in 10 the economy section? 11 MR. HARAKAS: There were other seats available, 12 Chief Justice. 13 QUESTION: In the economy section? 14 MR. HARAKAS: In the economy seat section. I 15 think when you -- it was very difficult to determine 16 because the plane was -- there were approximately 11 17 seats. Some of those 11 seats were in the smoking 18 section, but the -19 QUESTION: And in addition, there were the no20 revenue people who could have been asked to leave. 21 MR. HARAKAS: There were the non-revenue people, 22 but when you look to the record, the only way you could 23 determine the non-revenue people -- in fact, we had to 24 submit post-trial submissions after the trial to -- for 25 somebody to testify to interpret the codes that were on
10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the passenger manifest to determine who were revenue and 2 who were non-revenue. 3 QUESTION: This doesn't have anything to do with 4 the case, does it? 5 MR. HARAKAS: No, it doesn't, Your Honor. It 6 doesn't have -7 QUESTION: So what are we talking about it for? 8 I mean, it -- it -- the issue before us is not negligence. 9 MR. HARAKAS: It's not -10 QUESTION: The issue before us is whether it was 11 an accident. 12 MR. HARAKAS: Exactly. It is whether it was an 13 accident. 14 QUESTION: May I ask this question? I know you 15 didn't argue about negligence, but you do seem to draw a 16 distinction between affirmative conduct on the one hand 17 and failure to act on the other hand. And my question to 18 you is, supposing that without asking the stewardess, the 19 passenger had gotten into a -- a non-smoking seat seven or 20 eight rows ahead of where he was sitting and then was 21 ordered to return to his seat. Would that have been an 22 accident? 23 MR. HARAKAS: Under the circumstances, no, I 24 don't think under -- for purposes of the Warsaw 25 Convention, that would have been an accident.
11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: That would have been. 2 MR. HARAKAS: It would not have been an 3 accident. 4 QUESTION: It would not have been. 5 MR. HARAKAS: Because again, the injury -6 QUESTION: So then -- then you don't rely on a 7 distinction for the action and non-action. 8 MR. HARAKAS: Well, because -- well, I do rely 9 on the distinction between action and non-action because 10 you could have an omission which in and of itself cannot 11 be an accident. I -- I really gave a lot of thought to 12 this. I looked at the cases and I could never find a pure 13 omission being an accident. A omission can result in an 14 accident. 15 QUESTION: Well, why is this a pure omission? 16 It seems to me she misrepresented that the plane was full 17 twice when that wasn't true. That doesn't sound like an 18 omission to me. She told the wife to sit down. She -19 well, how do you treat that she was supposed to report 20 such incidents to her supervisor and she didn't do that? 21 MR. HARAKAS: The -- the bottom line of the 22 allegations here were that the -- the flight attendant 23 should have taken action to move Mr. -- Dr. Hanson to 24 another seat, and failure to do so would be -25 QUESTION: And part of what -- part of what she
12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 had -2 MR. HARAKAS: -- in itself an omission. 3 QUESTION: Part of the picture is things that 4 she affirmatively did do, and part are things she didn't 5 do. And I don't understand that the law makes a 6 distinction between doing what one should not have done or 7 not doing what one should have done. 8 MR. HARAKAS: Generally in -- under negligence 9 law -- under negligence law a negligence can be an act or 10 omission. But here, when you're looking to the treaty of 11 an accident defined as an unusual, unexpected event or 12 happening, you basically have a non-event, something that 13 did not happen. You -- you see that I think in the -14 QUESTION: Yes, but you -- you say you wouldn't 15 draw the distinction I suggested. So assume the case was 16 the other way around, that the stewardess told him to get 17 back to his seat. Now, why would that not be an accident? 18 MR. HARAKAS: Because at that point, when he got 19 back to his seat, he would be back to his normal assigned 20 non-smoking seat. While in close proximity to the smoking 21 section, again, you have to see that smoke on a smoking 22 aircraft, a known smoking aircraft, nobody -- you know, 23 there was no surprise here when he got on board on this 24 aircraft that there was a -- there was going to be smoke 25 on this aircraft -- is not an unusual, unexpected event.
13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: But I want to be sure I understand 2 your position. If the stewardess had gone to the captain 3 of the plane and said, we've got a guy in the back seat 4 who said he's going to die because he can't stand smoke, 5 he wants to sit in the front seat, and he's grabbed a seat 6 up there, should I order him back to the old seat, and the 7 captain says, yes, send him back, would that be an 8 accident? 9 MR. HARAKAS: Under the Warsaw Convention, I 10 don't think it would be an accident, and here's why. It 11 -- these are extreme examples that -- with respect to that 12 where -- the passenger in this case -- don't forget too, 13 the flight attendant did give the option to this passenger 14 to move. He could have taken self-help to remedy the 15 situation, but he opted not to. But in those type of 16 situations, you have instances where they're very extreme 17 examples, but -- and the convention doesn't necessarily 18 provide a remedy for all those types of situations. 19 QUESTION: I -- I take it -- I take it you think 20 -- is it Abramson in the Third Circuit where they -- the 21 -- the passenger can't lie -- lie down. 22 MR. HARAKAS: Exactly, Justice Kennedy. 23 QUESTION: You take the position that case is 24 wrong? 25 MR. HARAKAS: No. That -- that position -- that
14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 case is -- is 100 percent correct and it's very analogous 2 to our case because in the Abramson -3 QUESTION: That's -- that's -- it seems to me 4 there's an accident in that case. 5 MR. HARAKAS: In that case, the -- the court of 6 appeals found there was not an accident. 7 QUESTION: I understand, but it seems to me that 8 there is. 9 MR. HARAKAS: Well, Abramson followed the -10 almost the exact criteria set forth by the Court in Saks. 11 Was it an unusual, unexpected event? And they found that 12 being seated in an aircraft seat -- you're assigned an 13 aircraft seat -- is not -- and sustaining an injury due to 14 your own internal reaction was not an accident because 15 they, again, focused on what was the precise factual event 16 that led to the injury. 17 QUESTION: Of course, there it seems to me that 18 the -- the internal cause is -- is much greater than it -19 it is here. 20 Let -- let's -- can we take the case on the 21 assumption -- I think we must take the case on the 22 assumption, based on the -- on the findings of the 23 district court, that if they had moved the passenger, the 24 event would not have occurred. 25 MR. HARAKAS: We have to --
15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Now -2 MR. HARAKAS: Yes. We have to take -3 QUESTION: -- if we take the case on that 4 assumption, it's -- it seems to me it's got to be an 5 accident. 6 MR. HARAKAS: I disagree, Justice Kennedy, 7 because again, I -- I just come back to when I was looking 8 at all the cases and looking at the treaty and the text of 9 the convention, you always do have to look to the injury10 producing event because the text of the treaty says an 11 accident which causes the damage. And I think it does 12 come down to showing what is the direct event. 13 I think when you look at the Krys case, I think 14 the Court -- the Eleventh Circuit in Krys clearly set 15 forth, I think, a very workable standard. They say let's 16 look at the -- we ask let's look at the precise event. We 17 look at what were the precise events that caused this 18 injury, not the actions of the air carrier that they could 19 have taken to avert that injury. 20 QUESTION: But was it determined here that the 21 passenger died from smoke exposure? 22 MR. HARAKAS: There was at the -- there was a -23 a legal finding that it was the smoke that killed the 24 passenger even though -25 QUESTION: And do we take the case on that
16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 understanding? 2 MR. HARAKAS: You would have to take the case on 3 the understanding because we didn't raise the factual 4 issue that he would have died from the food poisoning. 5 QUESTION: And is it the case that there would 6 have been seats possibly available more removed from the 7 smoke so that it wouldn't have been as heavy an exposure 8 to smoke? 9 MR. HARAKAS: I don't -- I don't think there was 10 any evidence to establish the concentrations of the 11 cigarette smoke. There were seats that were further 12 removed, but then you come down to, again, factual issues 13 or determinations as to, well, how far do you remove the 14 passenger. Is three further rows further ahead, five rows 15 further ahead enough? 16 QUESTION: But here there was a total refusal 17 to -18 MR. HARAKAS: There was a -- well, there was 19 a -20 QUESTION: -- to provide any help. 21 MR. HARAKAS: There was a refusal to -- there 22 was a refusal to move him because the flight attendant 23 believed the flight was full, and it was, other than the 24 10 seats. But the -- the flight attendant did give this 25 passenger the option to reseat himself.
17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Well, you -- you say you have to 2 consider just very precisely what caused the injury. What 3 is your view here of what caused the injury? 4 MR. HARAKAS: What caused the injury was his 5 exposure to the cigarette smoke under the facts of this 6 case and on the findings. And then we have to determine 7 was cigarette smoke in that area, ambient cigarette smoke, 8 unusual, unexpected, and even the lower court found that 9 cigarette smoke on a smoking aircraft is not an unusual, 10 unexpected event. 11 QUESTION: When you say the -- the airline gave 12 the passenger the option to reseat himself, wasn't it the 13 option to -- to request another passenger to change seats 14 with him? 15 MR. HARAKAS: To change seats with him. 16 QUESTION: Yes. 17 MR. HARAKAS: Or he could have -- what the -- or 18 he could have moved through the cabin to see if he could 19 locate an empty seat. 20 But mind you, the flight attendant never had any 21 direct communications with Dr. Hanson. It was always 22 through his wife. There were two requests made to move on 23 initial boarding. 24 QUESTION: Well, but does that make -- does that 25 make any difference in -- in this case, the fact that his
18
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 wife was speaking for him? 2 MR. HARAKAS: No. I mean, it would have made a 3 difference in the lower court as to the issue of 4 reasonableness and things like that, but for purpose of 5 the legal issue before the Court, no, it doesn't make a 6 difference because, again, when you look at -- when you 7 look at all the various cases, when you come through Krys, 8 Abramson, and the other pre-Tseng cases -- and I draw that 9 distinction before Tseng -- the courts universally had 10 held that a passenger's injury arising out of his own 11 internal reaction to the conditions on the aircraft is not 12 an accident. 13 And when you look to the history of the 14 convention itself, here the lower courts, in effect -15 while we say they didn't use negligence, they, in effect, 16 imported concepts of negligence, reasonableness, 17 reasonable alternatives, things like that, those types of 18 concepts. 19 QUESTION: How about other courts? I mean, we 20 do look to see what our treaty partners do in this area. 21 The two other courts that were cited in the brief that 22 addressed this question seem to agree with the decision of 23 the Ninth Circuit in this case. 24 MR. HARAKAS: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The 25 one court was an Australian court in Povi, a lower court
19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 case, which that case has been appealed and argued on 2 appeal. And that case -- that was in the DVT context. I 3 think that court suffered from the same fundamental errors 4 that the courts here below did in viewing what the -5 QUESTION: What about the court of appeals in 6 England -7 MR. HARAKAS: -- that -8 QUESTION: -- that disagreed on the -- on the -9 whatever that -10 MR. HARAKAS: Yes, the DVT litigation. 11 QUESTION: Disagreed on that, but did say, went 12 out of its way to say, it thought that this case was the 13 right way to go about it. 14 MR. HARAKAS: Well, the -- on the DVT litigation 15 case, the court found that -- he disagreed with the 16 reasoning of the lower courts, but he said that he could 17 certainly understand the result. But he was, again, 18 focusing in on the facts because if you applied the -19 QUESTION: Well, that's surely dictum anyway. I 20 mean -21 MR. HARAKAS: Yes, well -22 QUESTION: -- the dictum in that case that -23 that he thought that this case came out right below. We 24 wouldn't even -- we wouldn't even give dispositive effect 25 to our own dictum much less to the dictum of a court of
20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 appeals in England.

2 MR. HARAKAS: You're -- you're right, Justice

3 Scalia. It was dicta. And what happened was in that

4 case, I think he had a misperception of the facts at the

5 end of the day, and if you applied the rationale that he

6 used for his opinion in dismissing those cases, the facts

7 of this case would inevitably lead to the dismissal of

8 this case and a finding of no accident.

9 QUESTION: I don't think so, having read his

10 decision and the other members of the court of appeals.

11

QUESTION:

What was Lord Phillips'

12 misperception?

13 MR. HARAKAS: As to the enforced exposure to the

14 cigarette smoke because -- because the passenger here was

15 given the option to relocate, and he could have relocated

16 himself.

17 QUESTION: The option being -- the option being

18 the one that was mentioned a moment ago. Your husband can

19 get up and try to get somebody else to move?

20 MR. HARAKAS: Switch or find another -- one of

21 the available empty seats. Because then you also have to

22 remember, again, I -- well, I don't want to get into

23 the --

24 QUESTION: She -- she said positively there are

25 no empty seats. The -- the option that was given to the

1 wife was that you go ask another passenger to switch 2 seats. 3 MR. HARAKAS: Sure, because -- because at the 4 time, you know, there were only 11 empty seats, and she 5 said that the plane is full. And that -- and that's at 6 the time of boarding as well, in the middle of boarding. 7 It's a flight that had been delayed for 3 hours. 8 Everybody is coming on board the plane. 9 QUESTION: But by the time the second and third 10 inquiries were asked, it should have been evident that 11 there were empty seats. 12 MR. HARAKAS: Well, the -- the second inquiry 13 was just before -- shortly before takeoff on -- on a 14 flight delayed for 3 hours, and they're trying to take 15 off, and she says, I can't help you right now. And one 16 thing -- and then the third one was shortly after takeoff. 17 QUESTION: Well, but the -- I wouldn't think 18 they allowed smoking before takeoff. 19 MR. HARAKAS: No, they did not allow smoking 20 before takeoff. It wasn't until the third incident 21 shortly after takeoff when smoking was allowed, and then 22 she said, can you please move my husband now? And the 23 request was denied. 24 But I think with -- with respect to the whole 25 accident inquiry issue here, we also have to look to, when
22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 you start bringing in the definition of what is an 2 accident, when you start equating with issues of 3 negligence and common law, I think we go astray and go 4 contrary to what the drafters intended as to what the 5 Court here in Tseng held, that you don't -- accident is 6 not a common law concept. It's a self-contained -7 QUESTION: If Tseng had held nothing on this 8 point, in fact, it -- it said that the Second Circuit's 9 conclusion that that wasn't an accident was doubtful. In 10 Tseng, it was an academic question. What barred her from 11 getting recovery under the treaty was she didn't suffer 12 from a physical injury or from a psychological injury with 13 -- with physical manifestations. She didn't die and she 14 didn't have the kind of injury that would qualify. Tseng 15 -- I think you are quite wrong in saying that that 16 decision passed on the concept of accident. 17 MR. HARAKAS: No. I agree with you, Justice 18 Ginsburg. I may have misspoke because you're absolutely 19 right. There was only that one footnote that -- where the 20 Court did express concern as to whether the court in the 21 Second Circuit flexibly applied the Tseng decision. But I 22 was talking about the -- what I meant was the broader 23 context of Tseng with respect to importation or allowing a 24 parallel state cause of action in light of the exclusivity 25 of the convention and the uniformity principles set forth
23
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 in the convention.

2 And if you start importing concepts of

3 negligence back into the convention -- because, in effect,

4 what the courts are doing below is they're saying, fine,

5 we can't go to State law, but what we'll do is we'll --

6 we'll define an accident to make it equivalent to a

7 negligence cause of action.

So there's really no

8 difference. What the courts are doing is nullifying the

9 exclusivity holding by equating any act of negligence as

10 an accident.

11 QUESTION: But are -- are you saying here that

12 the court of appeals really wrote an opinion about -- in

13 negligence and saying that's an accident?

14 MR. HARAKAS: When you read the -- the language

15 of the court of appeals, it's -- it's pure negligence

16 language.

17 QUESTION: But -- but it seems to me whatever

18 you think about what the flight attendant did, it -- it

19 can't be classed as negligence here. It was a refusal to

20 do something.

21 MR. HARAKAS: It was a refusal. It was a -- it

22 was a -- in my view, it was an omission, and I think at --

23 when you take omissions and put it in the context of what

24 is -- is that an unusual, unexpected event, that an

25 omission cannot in and of itself be the accident.

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: I don't know if we really have to get 2 into the act versus omission question here because this 3 was more than that. It was a refusal to take action in 4 the face of an alleged severe medical problem and in -- in 5 contravention to the rules of the airline at the time. So 6 you could characterize this, I think, as some kind of 7 positive action, in effect. 8 MR. HARAKAS: Well, I -- when I think of an 9 event, I think of some type of positive action, and in 10 this instance, when -- when I look at a refusal to do 11 something, I look at it as -- as an omission. 12 But even if you did look at it as a positive 13 event here, Justice O'Connor, I think you -- although -14 everything leads us back to trying to identify was the 15 event that caused the injury here unusual, unexpected. 16 And that -- there's only one injury-producing event. For 17 example, let's say nobody asked the airline in this case 18 to move Dr. Hanson. There was no request made, and he 19 remained in his non-smoking seat. 20 QUESTION: No request made? I thought the wife 21 made a request. 22 MR. HARAKAS: I'm sorry. 23 QUESTION: Excuse me. 24 MR. HARAKAS: A hypothetical. 25 QUESTION: Oh.
25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. HARAKAS: Let's assume no request had been 2 made, and he would have remained in that same non-smoking 3 seat and he would have died because of the exposure to the 4 ambient cigarette smoke, according to plaintiffs' theory. 5 What would be the injury-producing event there? What 6 caused that death? His internal reaction to the cigarette 7 smoke, the normal -- which was normal and expected. 8 Now, the fact that they asked -- somebody asked 9 for him to be moved doesn't change the injury-producing 10 event. The injury-producing event is the same. It's the 11 exposure to the cigarette smoke. 12 QUESTION: Well, but of course, the exposure 13 might have been substantially reduced if the passenger had 14 been able to get seated in an area further removed from 15 the active smokers. 16 MR. HARAKAS: There -- he still would have had 17 -- there still would have been ambient cigarette smoke 18 throughout the cabin, as we all well know. 19 QUESTION: Well, suppose there were five rows of 20 empty seats in front and a -- a stewardess -- and there 21 are stewardesses like this sometimes that we don't people 22 wandering around the plane. We're serving food. You must 23 sit down in your seat. A different case? 24 MR. HARAKAS: No, not a different case because 25 you are assigned to your assigned seat, and again, it's
26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 one of those extreme examples that if I believed there 2 were five empty rows here, he probably would have gotten 3 up and found it himself. But in that case, I don't feel 4 there would be a different case because, again, I -- I 5 focus in on this injury-producing event here, and the 6 injury-producing event is the exposure to cigarette smoke 7 which was normal and expected. 8 QUESTION: So your -- your submission is if the 9 airline requires you to sit in the no-smoking seat for no 10 particularly good reason, there's still no accident. 11 MR. HARAKAS: Oh, I -- I disagree on that one 12 because if they required you to sit in a non-smoking seat 13 and you had -14 QUESTION: Well, that was my hypothetical. 15 MR. HARAKAS: Okay. If they -- if you -- if 16 they require you to sit in a smoking section? 17 QUESTION: No. One -- just one -- one row 18 ahead. 19 MR. HARAKAS: There would be no difference in 20 the situation from this -- from our scenario. There still 21 would not be an accident. He was assigned a non-smoking 22 seat and you -- again, you look to was his own internal 23 reaction here to the normal and expected operation of the 24 aircraft. 25 And I think when -- when you look at the
27
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 convention, the structure of the convention, and what they 2 had in mind by the term accident, you have to -- you can 3 only come back to that one basic conclusion, that you look 4 to what is that injury-producing event. 5 I'd like just to reserve the remaining -- my 6 time for rebuttal if there are no further questions. 7 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Harakas. 8 Mr. Farr, we'll hear from you. 9 ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III 10 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 11 MR. FARR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 12 the Court: 13 There are basically two reasons why we think 14 that article 17 imposes liability when an airline 15 knowingly leaves a passenger in medical jeopardy without 16 taking basic measures to alleviate the harm. 17 First, because that kind of action violates 18 normal industry safety practices and thus, under Saks -19 QUESTION: Well, that's the question. Is it an 20 accident? You assume it. You say that kind of accident. 21 Well, I think that's the issue. Is it an accident? 22 MR. FARR: I'm sorry if I said that kind of -- I 23 meant to say that kind of action under Saks is contrary to 24 -- to the normal industry safety practices. 25 QUESTION: Let me ask about Saks. It's -- it
28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 seems to me that the fallacy in the argument that -- that 2 you -- you run and that the Government runs is that it 3 accepts the language of Saks as the totality of what is 4 necessary to be an accident. 5 Now, Saks involved a fellow who had some problem 6 with his ear which was -- caused him harm because of the 7 normal depressor -- pressurization of the -- of the 8 cockpit. And in denying relief under the -- under the 9 convention, the Court says, no, that wasn't an accident 10 because the cockpits are pressurized all the time, and if 11 it -- it has -- to be an accident, it has to be an 12 unexpected or unusual event or happening. Okay. 13 Saks was not saying that that is a sufficient 14 condition to be an accident. It was just saying that that 15 is a necessary condition. 16 Now, let me -- let me give -- give you a 17 hypothetical and you tell me why -- why this would be an 18 accident. It seems to me the hypothetical closely 19 parallels what happened here. 20 A man hurls himself into the sea intending to 21 commit suicide. There is right nearby to where he hurled 22 himself into the sea a dock with 30 people on it and 30 23 life preservers at their feet, and not a single one of 24 them picks up the life preserver and throws it to the 25 drowning man. I don't know why. Maybe they're 30
29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 libertarians who think people should be able to kill 2 themselves. Whatever. 3 (Laughter.) 4 QUESTION: Certainly -- certainly an unexpected 5 and unusual event. Who would imagine that with 30 life 6 preservers within reach of the man, nobody would throw 7 one. 8 Now, would anybody in his right mind say that 9 this man died because of an accident? Of course, not. 10 Unexpected and unanticipated is a -- a necessary condition 11 for -- for saying that something was caused by an 12 accident, but it's surely not a sufficient condition. 13 And it seems to me what happened in this plane 14 is exactly like that. It is an event after the person was 15 endangered. I -- I don't think that this person died 16 because of an accident. It just doesn't make it. And 17 that's the language of the convention, not Saks. 18 MR. FARR: Well, Justice Scalia, it seems to me 19 that -- that the point that you're making, which in one 20 sense I think is a correct one, is that the language of -21 of article 17, if one looks at it in purely colloquial 22 terms, may not exactly correspond with the definition in 23 Saks. But the language in article 17 isn't used -- the 24 term accident isn't used purely in the colloquial sense. 25 What we know from the context of the convention as a whole
30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 and the liability system as a whole and from Saks is that 2 sometimes it actually captures less than the colloquial 3 sense of the term accident, sometimes it's more. 4 For example, the mere fact that somebody has a 5 heart attack typically would be, in the colloquial sense, 6 thought of as an accident. But we've learned from Saks 7 that it is not itself going to be considered the accident 8 because of the context of article 17 and the -- the 9 language about accidents causing death or bodily injury. 10 By the same token, the deliberate refusal to 11 help somebody, as the Chief Justice pointed out in his -12 his earlier question I think, is -- is normally, in 13 colloquial terms, not thought of as an accident. It's not 14 inadvertent. It's deliberate. But we know under article 15 17 that deliberate conduct can, in fact, be an accident. 16 If a flight attendant strikes a passenger in the face or 17 throws coffee on the passenger in a fit of rage, that is 18 an accident for purposes of article 17. 19 QUESTION: I'm willing to say that negligent 20 conduct such as occurred here can be an accident. Of 21 course, it can. If -- if the flight attendant spills some 22 hot liquid on the passenger causing the passenger to be 23 scalded, of course, that -- that's an accident. 24 MR. FARR: Well, Justice Scalia -25 QUESTION: That fits the normal -- the normal
31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 concept of accident. 2 MR. FARR: Of course, but -- but -3 QUESTION: What happened here does not fit the 4 normal description of accident. 5 MR. FARR: But my example is not a -- an 6 accidental spilling. I'm -- I'm actually talking about it 7 just to try to get at the colloquial sense, which I think 8 is what disturbs you, that -- that if -- if in fact the -9 the flight attendant purposely throws the coffee on the 10 passenger, just become irritated with the passenger, that 11 would not normally be thought of as an accident, if you're 12 asking people around the coffee shop whether there's been 13 an accident. 14 But in terms of article 17, it is an accident 15 because we know article 17 covers instances of willful 16 misconduct. Article 17 is the gateway by which you get to 17 any liability, and willful misconduct includes certainly 18 the kinds of -- of things that I'm talking about, 19 deliberate conduct. 20 QUESTION: Can this be said to be that kind of 21 conduct where it's contrary to the policy of the airline? 22 MR. FARR: Yes, it can, Justice O'Connor. I 23 mean, one of the things that's a little bit curious in -24 in tying the two questions together with Justice Scalia's 25 question, this is a -- this is an incident which in fact
32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 is to some extent intentional. 2 QUESTION: Yes. 3 MR. FARR: I mean, the -- it was not inadvertent 4 that -- that the passenger was left in his seat. For 5 example, just -- just to take a different, slightly 6 changed analogy, if in fact the passenger had -- had asked 7 to be moved in -- out of the vicinity of the smoke, and 8 the flight attendant had said, let me wait until everybody 9 is seated, I'll come back and get you in half an hour, and 10 she forgot to do that, that would actually in colloquial 11 terms seem more like an accident. Somehow negligently she 12 forgot to come back. But in fact, in this particular 13 case, she was asked three times and knowing in fact what 14 she was doing, she said, no, I'm not going to move you. 15 QUESTION: What if she -- what if she'd been 16 asked to move him, and she said I'll be back, and then 17 another passenger gets very ill and she has to take care 18 of him right away, and then the facts are the same. 19 Accident there? 20 MR. FARR: The question then I think -- the -21 the proper way to answer that, Justice Kennedy, is to look 22 at what would happen in the normal flight under the normal 23 circumstances. Obviously, under the circumstances we had 24 here, it's unusual and unexpected that she didn't move 25 him. If in fact the reason was that there was some other
33
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 enormous problem on the plane and all of the flight 2 attendants had to deal with that particular problem, then 3 it seems to me the -- the action here would not be unusual 4 and unexpected. 5 QUESTION: Well, that's -6 QUESTION: Your -- you stated in your opening 7 that the airline's conduct here was contrary to industry 8 policy, and I think Justice O'Connor premised an earlier 9 question on saying it was against the policy of -- of this 10 particular airline. Spell that out a little, will you? 11 What was the policy of -- of the airline and why did this 12 action violate it? 13 MR. FARR: The policy of the airline and the 14 policy generally, because I think they're in this case the 15 same -16 QUESTION: They're the same. 17 MR. FARR: -- was when a passenger requests a 18 move for medical reasons, that the policy is to 19 accommodate that request if it's possible to do so. And 20 it was possible here because there were empty seats in the 21 coach cabin, so we don't have to get into the complicated 22 questions of whether you have to move someone to first 23 class or to -- to alleviate the problem. 24 QUESTION: Would -- would it have been any more 25 or less of an accident if that practice had not prevailed
34
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 in the industry? 2 MR. FARR: I think it's possible that it would. 3 I mean, I -- our position is not that essentially the 4 industry can give itself immunity by lowering its 5 standards so much that -- that acts that -- that clearly 6 are unusual, but nonetheless within the -- the industry 7 standard are -- are immune from liability. But I think 8 the general idea is in trying to evaluate things that 9 aren't obviously accidents, we have to have some sort of 10 benchmark to judge whether what's happened is unusual. 11 The natural place is to look -- is -- is at the industry 12 practice. And if in fact what they've done is consistent 13 with industry practice, I would think in the usual case 14 certainly that would suggest there hasn't been an unusual 15 event. 16 QUESTION: Well, but it was unusual here. 17 MR. FARR: Absolutely. 18 QUESTION: So why isn't this an accident in the 19 same sense that having an attendant throw hot coffee on a 20 passenger would be? 21 MR. FARR: It is. 22 QUESTION: Supposing the airline's defense to 23 throwing hot coffee on the passenger said our stewardesses 24 do that all the time. 25 (Laughter.)
35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: There's unexpected about it. 2 MR. FARR: I mean, the -- the fact is as I say, 3 that I don't think that necessarily having a very low 4 standard in the company itself or in the industry will, in 5 fact, give you immunity, although I have to say I think 6 that in fact that's an unlikely thing to happen because 7 when we talk about the Warsaw Convention, there's a 8 natural -9 QUESTION: Mr. Farr, can I interrupt for a 10 second? It seems to me that in the question of whether 11 you move a passenger or not, you could have a situation 12 which for security reasons, as they have around 13 Washington, every passenger must remain in his or her -14 her seat for 500 miles or 30 minutes or so, and refusal to 15 move during that period could not possibly be an accident. 16 MR. FARR: That's correct, Justice Stevens. I 17 think -- but -- but the analysis would be the same. I 18 mean, one of the instructions that Saks gives, I think 19 correctly, is that you have to look at all the 20 circumstances. What is unusual or unexpected under 21 certain circumstances would not be unusual or expected -22 unexpected under other circumstances like the one -23 QUESTION: What -- what role does fault play? 24 It -- it seemed to me, as I was reading the Ninth Circuit 25 opinion in Saks, that negligence is probably not a
36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 requisite. I don't know if that makes it necessary for us 2 to send it back. Suppose we think that's true. Would we 3 send it back to the court of appeals and say, no, no, 4 negligence is -- is not the standard, go ahead and find 5 fault on their -- or whether or not there's an accident 6 under some other standard? 7 MR. FARR: Justice Kennedy, I -- I don't think 8 that's necessary. I mean, what the Ninth Circuit 9 basically said was this is an unusual or unexpected event 10 under Saks because it violates industry policies, industry 11 standards, the company policy, and particularly given the 12 nature of the request. If the Ninth Circuit had stopped 13 there, it seems to me that their decision would be 14 absolutely correct. 15 QUESTION: Well, it didn't. It went on and got 16 a bunch of negligence language in there. 17 MR. FARR: Well, it's the following sentence 18 that obviously raises at least some questions. And I 19 should say I'm not sure that -- that language in itself 20 should be as troubling as it perhaps appears to some 21 because the -- the situations that -- that the court 22 describes there very often will be, it seems to me, 23 unusual or unexpected situations. 24 But nonetheless, it seems to me that -- that 25 following the adage that the Court sits to review
37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 judgments and not opinions, that the Court can simply say, 2 as we -- we suggest would be sufficient, that you do have 3 an unusual and unexpected event when you fail to help a 4 passenger in violation of the standard industry practice. 5 Now, if the standard industry practice would be 6 not to help a passenger under certain circumstances and 7 the claim is still made that it's unusual or unexpected, 8 one would need another benchmark for reference, but the 9 Court doesn't need to reach that in this case. 10 Now, I would like to -- to also point out that 11 in -- in -- when we're talking about the language of -- of 12 article 17, while I think it's -- it's proper to -- to 13 focus on the language itself and discuss it in -- in the 14 context of Saks, that it's also I think proper to look at 15 the context of the convention as a whole and whether, in 16 fact, competing interpretations of the term accident would 17 lead to absurd consequences. 18 Here I think if in fact the definition or the 19 application of the definition that Olympic tries to -- to 20 urge on the Court is accepted, that one is going to find 21 that -- that this convention, which is intended to be the 22 exclusive means of remedy for passengers who suffer death 23 or bodily injury on an international flight, is -- is 24 going to have essentially a hole in it where it doesn't 25 cover situations even, as in this case, whether it's
38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 willful misconduct by the airline crew that causes the 2 injury. 3 And the focus that -- you know, in terms of 4 whether that is a reasonable understanding to attribute to 5 the parties to the convention under the circumstances, it 6 seems to me when you -- when you say a positive act would 7 be an accident, an omission that would cause an accident 8 would be -- you know, would -- would involve an accident, 9 but there's liability whatsoever for situations in which 10 the -- the conduct itself is the contributing factor, the 11 failure to do something is the -- is a strong contributing 12 factor, doesn't really make any reasonable sense as a 13 construction, and particularly because one of the things 14 that the -- the parties must have understood is that 15 during the time that the passenger is -- is covered by 16 article 17, if you will, from the time of embarkation to 17 the time of disembarkation, the passenger is largely in 18 the control of the airline. The airline determines where 19 the passenger sits. So the passenger's opportunities to 20 engage in self-help are greatly reduced. 21 And in that situation, the idea that the -- that 22 the parties thought that airlines could simply say we have 23 passengers on our plane who need our help for medical 24 reasons, and we're not going to provide any help 25 whatsoever and that either causes greater injury -- causes
39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 injury in the first place, causes greater injury, or in an 2 unhappy case like this one, actually causes a death, their 3 theory would say there's still no liability. And it would 4 seem to me you would need a very, very clear indication 5 from the text, which doesn't exist here, to reach that 6 result. 7 QUESTION: Well, what if someone suffered, say, 8 a heart attack on the plane and it was 3 hours from its 9 destination and the doctor there said, you know, you've 10 really got to -- in -- in order to avoid this guy probably 11 dying, you're going to have to land somewhere en route? 12 Now, would an airline be obligated to do that in order to 13 avoid this sort of accident? 14 MR. FARR: It depends on the circumstances, but 15 I think the general industry practice would be, in fact, 16 that an airline would be -- would -- would normally divert 17 to a nearer airport in fact to -- to save the -- the 18 passenger from death or from much more severe injury. 19 That in a sense is the Krys case, the Eleventh 20 Circuit case, that Olympic says is in conflict with the 21 decision in this case. That was a case in which the 22 Eleventh Circuit said, well, the -- the failure to divert, 23 which it -- it was agreed would -- would have made a 24 significant difference to the passenger's health, was not 25 unusual because the plane just did the normal thing. It
40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 just flew to its regular destination. But the problem 2 with Krys is that if you look at all the circumstances, as 3 Saks says, it's not the normal thing just to fly on to 4 your intended destination when a passenger has had a heart 5 attack and the medical indication -6 QUESTION: Well, then -- then you're saying 7 basically it depends on airline practice whether something 8 is expected or unexpected and whether it's the normal 9 practice. 10 MR. FARR: In this context. I mean, obviously, 11 sometimes it's -- it's -- if -- if the context is the -12 the failure to help a passenger in -- in medical distress, 13 then it seems to me that the usual practice of -- of the 14 airline or the industry in general is -- is the proper 15 benchmark, at least initially, for determining whether 16 something is usual or unusual. 17 Now, obviously, there are other kinds of 18 accidents, crashes and hijackings and all, where -- where 19 common knowledge tells you what happened is unusual, but 20 where common knowledge doesn't necessarily tell you the 21 answer, then it does seem that reference to industry 22 standards is a useful benchmark. 23 QUESTION: Would you comment on the distinction 24 between an event and an accident? 25 MR. FARR: Well, the event is under -- under

1 Saks -- I mean, the difference is that an accident has to 2 be an unusual event, that not every event is an accident. 3 You have to demonstrate that it's unusual, and -- and much 4 of what we've talked about this morning, obviously, is -5 is why this would be unusual by reference to industry 6 standards. But an event, if one looks at a dictionary 7 definition, is simply something that happened on the 8 plane. 9 QUESTION: I think it would affect the liability 10 for loss of baggage and so forth. That's triggered by an 11 event, as I understand it. 12 MR. FARR: That's correct. It is now. It was 13 at one time triggered by an occurrence, and under the 1999 14 Montreal Convention it's triggered by an event. Yes. 15 QUESTION: Do you think the Abramson case in the 16 Third Circuit was properly decided? 17 MR. FARR: I don't -- I am not sure the result 18 was wrong. I don't think the approach was correct. I 19 think the court should have asked what the usual industry 20 practice would have been in that case, and if the usual 21 industry practice would have been to make an accommodation 22 along the lines that -- that the passenger requested, then 23 I think that might have well have been an accident. I 24 think it's a -- it's a difficult question as to whether 25 that would have been true because that particular

1 passenger needed to be moved into first class, needed two 2 first class seats, and in fact part of the solution was he 3 was perhaps going to introduce self-induced vomiting as a 4 cure, which obviously would affect other passengers in the 5 cabin. So, you know, on the facts, one ultimately might 6 have said -- the -- the judgment that was made there 7 actually comported with -- with the usual industry 8 standards. However, we don't know the answer because the 9 Third Circuit didn't ask the right question. 10 QUESTION: But you do think the Eleventh Circuit 11 Krys case was wrong in both reasoning and result. 12 MR. FARR: Well, Krys -- we have an additional 13 piece of information because the court went on to decide 14 the case. This was pre Tseng. So it actually decided the 15 case as a common law negligence case, and when it did so, 16 it found that what the airline had done by not diverting 17 in that particular case was a violation of industry 18 standards. So in that case I think what should have 19 happened in Krys is that the court should have made that 20 inquiry as part of the Warsaw Convention analysis, and if 21 it had done so in fact, it would have limited the recovery 22 in Krys, which was many millions of dollars, to the limits 23 of the Warsaw Convention, supplemented by the agreements. 24 If the Court has no further questions, thank 25 you.

1 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Farr. 2 Ms. McDowell, we'll hear from you. 3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL 4 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 5 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 6 MS. McDOWELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 7 please the Court: 8 A flight attendant's refusal to assist an ill 9 passenger can amount to an accident within the meaning of 10 the Warsaw Convention. The analysis focuses on whether 11 such conduct is, objectively speaking, unusual or 12 unexpected, taking into account the ordinary practices in 13 the industry and other indicia of what would be expected 14 in the circumstances. 15 At a minimum it's reasonable to construe the 16 convention's term accident, as the United States construes 17 it, to encompass the aberrant conduct of the flight crew, 18 and this Court has ordinarily accorded weight to the 19 United States' reasonable construction of treaties to 20 which it is a party. 21 Our reading of the term accident comports with 22 the text structure and purposes of the convention. The 23 term is a broad and inclusive one. It's not confined to 24 crashes or explosions or equipment failures. As the Court 25 recognized in Saks, it can encompass a wide array of
44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 unusual and unexpected events external to the passenger 2 potentially -3 QUESTION: Ms. McDowell -4 MS. McDOWELL: Yes. 5 QUESTION: -- assuming that it could have 6 happened somehow in an airline context, would you say that 7 Justice Scalia's hypothetical was an accident? 8 MS. McDOWELL: I think that a failure of an 9 airline employee to come to the assistance of a passenger 10 can, indeed, be an accident. One must recall that even 11 under the common law, common carriers such as airlines 12 have been understood to have special obligations toward 13 their passengers, not expansive obligations to act as 14 physicians to them, but to provide reasonable first aid 15 until they reach the destination. So I think that -- that 16 this particular context is -- is quite different from the 17 context when one is dealing with just a bystander. 18 And I think under the common law as well, there 19 have been other situations that might well be viewed as 20 accidents that involved omissions when one is under a duty 21 to act. 22 QUESTION: Okay. Let's say it wasn't a 23 bystander. Let's say that, you know, they were -- they 24 were relatives. They're the parents of -- of the person 25 who jumped. You still wouldn't call that an accident,
45
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 would you? Does it have anything to do with -- with

2 whether there's a duty or not? Some States do impose a

3 duty on -- on bystanders, by the way, and let's assume

4 that happens in a State where there is a duty.

5 MS. McDOWELL: Well, I think the inquiry here --

6

QUESTION:

You still wouldn't call it an

7 accident, I don't think. I mean, nobody would use the

8 English language that way.

9 MS. McDOWELL: Well, I think here under the

10 Warsaw Convention, the term accident has been understood

11 to refer to an unusual, unexpected event.

12 QUESTION: Okay. But wouldn't you -- Warsaw

13 Convention or not, wouldn't you call it an accident if the

14 bystanders had put up an advertisement saying, swim with

15 us for $500, and then they stood there?

16 MS. McDOWELL: Yes, that would -- that would

17 seem to be an accident.

18 QUESTION: That would get a little closer to our

19 situation, wouldn't it? And that --

20 MS. McDOWELL: Yes, Your Honor.

21 QUESTION: -- and that might well be an

22 accident.

23 MS. McDOWELL: Other circumstances -- medical

24 malpractice cases, for example, might be those where an

25 omission of some sort, because the doctor is under a duty

46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to act, could be viewed as an accident. For example, a 2 failure to diagnose or to treat a particular medical 3 condition until it's too late, if that was negligent, 4 could be an accident. 5 QUESTION: Would -- would you say that we ought 6 to write the opinion so that if there is negligence, that 7 is evidence that normal airline practices were not being 8 followed, and that's an accident? So that negligence is 9 important to the analysis, not necessary, but it -- it can 10 be helpful. 11 MS. McDOWELL: We would say that -12 QUESTION: Or -- or should we write the opinion 13 without talking about negligence? 14 MS. McDOWELL: We would say that the test is 15 objective reasonableness which connotes some of the same 16 concepts as negligence does in the common law. 17 QUESTION: Well, how does -- how does that 18 differ from -- from the common law at all? If you say 19 objective reasonableness, you're really just changing 20 accident into common law negligence, aren't you? 21 MS. McDOWELL: Well, not in all circumstances 22 because negligence isn't a necessary condition for an 23 accident to occur. An accident could be an act of God and 24 an event that did not involve negligence. 25 In this particular case, yes, the inquiry into
47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 due care and the inquiry into an -- whether an accident 2 has occurred are quite similar, but they're still focused 3 on a different question. The accident inquiry asks 4 whether something unusual or unexpected has happened, and 5 the due care inquiry under article 20 asks whether the 6 airline has acted with due care. 7 QUESTION: Well, negligence is a proxy for the 8 fact that normal airline operating rules were not being 9 followed. 10 MS. McDOWELL: Correct. Now, there may be 11 isolated instances where although ordinary practices were 12 being followed, those practices were so deficient that, 13 nonetheless, an accident might be found. Normally, 14 however, I think that -- that airlines' practices are to 15 treat passengers reasonably. So I think that asking the 16 reasonableness question would be the same as -- as seeing 17 whether there was a deviation from standard policies and 18 practices. 19 In construing the -20 QUESTION: You know, I think there may be a 21 public policy reason for construing accident contrary to 22 its normal meaning to embrace in this context intentional 23 acts whether by the airline employees or by pirates or -24 or terrorists or anybody else. But I don't -- I -- there 25 -- there's a problem in my mind about interpreting it to
48
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 -- to embrace especially negligent omissions. It seems to 2 me that's so far away from the normal meaning of accident 3 that I don't -- I don't see the justification for doing it 4 especially where it converts the convention into 5 essentially what it was not intended to be, liability for 6 negligence. That -7 MS. McDOWELL: Well, of course, in this case we 8 don't have a mere negligent omission. We have what the 9 district court found to be willful misconduct. We also 10 found -- this case also involves a -- a refusal to act, a 11 series of refusals to act, and -- and provision of 12 misinformation about whether the flight was completely 13 full or not. So it's -- it's difficult to characterize 14 this particular case -15 QUESTION: No, the misinformation didn't bear 16 any causality. I mean, the -- the -- what caused the 17 injury here was -- was not the misrepresentation about the 18 other seats. It was simply the failure to move the person 19 to another seat, and that is totally an -- an omission, it 20 seems to me. 21 MS. McDOWELL: I don't think it's properly 22 characterized as an omission when there were three 23 increasingly desperate requests to reseat the passenger 24 and the flight attendant responded on each occasion -25 QUESTION: I take it back. Three -- three
49
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 omissions.

2 MS. McDOWELL: I think that this sort of case

3 can be contrasted, for example, from a -- a simple failure

4 to warn case where the question is whether an airline

5 should have warned about a particular medical condition

6 that a passenger might have in response to ordinary

7 flight. This seems to involve much more. Certainly Lord

8 Phillips in the English court of appeals thought that this

9 case involved much more than -- than just a failure to

10 act.

11 The drafters of the Warsaw Convention certainly

12 didn't intend that airlines would be insurers for any harm

13 that befell a passenger during flight. They did intend,

14 however, that airlines would be held liable when their own

15 fault caused a passenger's death or bodily injury.

16 Indeed, they eliminated the caps on damages in cases when

17 that fault rose to the level of willful misconduct. This

18 would seem doubtful that the drafters intended simply by

19 their choice of the term accident to exempt airlines

20 entirely from liability in cases where passengers died or

21 suffered bodily injury because of the airline's fault,

22 including willful misconduct in this case.

23

QUESTION:

Well, is airline's fault even

24 required? Supposing that before the plane took off, there

25 was a big fire in the area and smoke filled the -- filled

1 the aircraft while it was on the runway and then he died 2 from that smoke, would that be an accident? 3 MS. McDOWELL: It could well be an accident, 4 Your Honor. It might not be an accident for which 5 liability would -- would be properly -6 QUESTION: Why wouldn't it be? 7 QUESTION: There's going to be an accident 8 within the meaning of the convention is what I'm asking 9 you. 10 MS. McDOWELL: Yes, it probably would. 11 QUESTION: So then the smoke doesn't have -- the 12 -- the -- whatever the accidental cause is, it doesn't 13 have to be fault of the airline. 14 MS. McDOWELL: That's correct because the 15 airlines have the opportunity under article 20 of the 16 convention to come back and say that we cannot be held 17 responsible for this accident because we did not act 18 negligently. 19 The understanding -20 QUESTION: I thought they had to show more than 21 that. I thought they had to show that they did everything 22 possible to prevent -- to prevent the -23 MS. McDOWELL: Well, the term in the treaty is 24 all necessary measures. 25 QUESTION: Yes.
51
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. McDOWELL: But it's been construed to mean

2 all reasonable measures.

So it's essentially been

3 understood as a -- a due care defense. And that's

4 reinforced in the Montreal Convention, the new convention

5 that has just come into force, that -- that uses the term

6 negligence in its own words.

7 The understanding that the accident requirement

8 can be satisfied in cases like this one serves the

9 convention's purpose of balancing the interests of air

10 carriers and passengers. Such cases do not pose a threat

11 of particularly expansive liability to airlines. Cases

12 such as this one where air carriers do something that is

13 unusual and unexpected and thereby cause a passenger's

14 death or bodily injury can be expected to remain

15 relatively few under the convention, as they are under

16 U.S. domestic law. Imposing liability, meanwhile, enables

17 passengers and their families to receive some measure of

18 compensation for their injuries and provides appropriate

19 incentives for airline supervision and -- and training of

20 their personnel.

21 For all of these reasons, we'd ask the judgment

22 of the court of appeals be affirmed.

23 QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. McDowell.

24 Mr. Harakas, you have 3 minutes remaining.

25 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. HARAKAS

52
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 2 MR. HARAKAS: Mr. Chief Justice, I think when 3 you -- when you look at the arguments that were made both 4 by the respondents and the Solicitor General, it all comes 5 back to the issue of negligence, wanting to equate an 6 accident with negligence. 7 The Warsaw Convention wasn't an all-encompassing 8 treaty. There were certain holes left in the convention 9 where there wasn't going to be recovery. For example, if 10 there's no bodily injury, there's no recovery under the 11 Warsaw Convention, as set forth by the Floyd decision, no 12 matter, let's say, how egregious the air carrier's conduct 13 may have been. It set forth certain things, and the 14 convention wanted to define the liability based on the -15 by using that term accident not making reference to 16 various common law notions. 17 I think one of the problems that we're seeing is 18 that confusing what is the accident -- and that's why I 19 always come back to the injury-producing event. In the 20 hijacking situation, for example, the accident there isn't 21 the failure of the airline to conduct proper screening and 22 allowing the hijackers to come on board the aircraft. The 23 accident is those hijackers get on the -- on the airplane 24 and they injure a passenger. And that -- the injury 25 itself is the accident. Just like in the smoke example,
53
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 if there was a fire someplace and the cabin filled up with 2 smoke, the smoke itself injuring the passenger is the 3 accident. Why the smoke got there is completely 4 irrelevant. 5 So when you -- when you start injecting the 6 whole concepts of negligence, I think you upset the whole 7 balance of the convention, and -- and one of the principal 8 goals of the convention was to have a uniformity and to 9 limit the liability of the carrier. In fact, the Montreal 10 Convention of 1999, which just -- which just entered into 11 force last week here in the United States, retained the 12 term accident. The issue of whether the carrier should be 13 liable for the state of the health of the passenger has 14 always been a very special and unique issue in the context 15 of the convention's history. Post-ratification conduct 16 from 1945 all the way through the -- all the way to the -17 the Montreal Convention of 1999, the contracting states 18 were very careful and very reluctant to make the carriers 19 liable for injuries arising out of their -- out of the 20 state of health of the passenger. 21 And the -- with respect to the policy arguments 22 where they say -- where the respondents and Solicitor 23 General say that the -- there are certainly policy reasons 24 should be considered in weighing in favor of the 25 passengers in this instance, I think when you look to --
54
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 you have to apply the strict terms of the convention. And 2 each time this Court has been confronted with similar 3 policy arguments, they have been rejected. In Saks, the 4 -- the passenger was left without a remedy because they 5 couldn't -- because the passenger couldn't satisfy the -6 the accident condition precedent. The same thing in 7 Floyd. There they couldn't satisfy the bodily injury 8 requirement. And in Tseng, where the -- there was no 9 remedy allowed under State law when they couldn't satisfy 10 the accident or the bodily injury conditions precedent. 11 Focusing on what the injury-producing event and 12 whether that event is unusual, unexpected, and external to 13 the passenger -- thank you, Your Honor. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. 15 Harakas. 16 The case is submitted. 17 (Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the 18 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
