1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:07 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument next in Case 08-1107, the Hertz Corporation v. 5 Friend. 6 Mr. Srinivasan. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. SRINIVASAN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, 10 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 11 The diversity statute deems a corporation a 12 citizen of, quote, "the State where it has its principal 13 place of business," closed quote. The Ninth Circuit 14 erred in holding that Petitioner Hertz is a citizen of 15 California, even though Hertz is headquartered in New 16 Jersey and conducts over 80 percent of its operations 17 outside the State of California, and even though, under 18 the court's approach, national corporations could 19 regularly be deemed California citizens if they conduct 20 operations in that State that are proportional to the 21 State's population. 22 The better reading of the statute, in our 23 view, is that it points to the location of the 24 corporation's headquarters, the site from which a 25 corporation directs and controls all the company's
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 operations throughout all of its locations. And that is 2 particularly the correct reading when the statutory 3 language is considered in light of two considerations. 4 First, the strong preference for simplicity 5 and ease of administration in jurisdictional rules; and 6 second, Congress's purposes in 1958 to preserve 7 diversity jurisdiction for corporations in 48 States and 8 to deny access to diversity jurisdiction only in one 9 State, the State where the corporation had its home or 10 principal place of business. 11 Now, with respect to the ordinary meaning of 12 the statutory text, the critical phrase is "principal 13 place of business." And dictionary definitions of that 14 term define the term "principal place of business" as 15 corporate headquarters, and that is fortified by Federal 16 and State laws, which also define the term as "company's 17 headquarters" -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the problem 19 with every test is that you can find an exception that 20 makes the application ridiculous. 21 Let's assume that we accept that 22 headquarters or nerve center may have some applicability 23 to a corporation that has a business in a variety of 24 different States. 25 MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure.

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. That's -2 your situation is perhaps the most attractive -3 MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because whether 5 California has 20 percent and Florida 14 or 15 percent, 6 to me the differences are not terribly substantial. I 7 can imagine McDonald's having 1 percent in every part of 8 the world, and how do you choose then? California would 9 say, then you -- you go back to headquarters. But I 10 don't know why you start there. 11 But let's posit the simpler situation. 12 Headquarters in New Jersey, but everything else is in 13 California. Your test would ignore completely that -14 and it depends on how you define "headquarters." If 15 they have three corporate executives, that's the entire 16 extent -- or let's say one corporate executive who 17 started the company and who lives in New Jersey, and he 18 flies out to California half the time and runs the 19 business from there but happens to live in New Jersey. 20 Then you would say diversity is still New Jersey, 21 correct? 22 MR. SRINIVASAN: We would, Your Honor. But 23 let me -- let me start first with accepting Your Honor's 24 premise, that in the situation of a multistate 25 corporation with -- with diverse operations, the
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 principal place of business would be the headquarters. 2 Now, I take your point that there are 3 situations in which the test may not seem so 4 straightforward, but we think even in the -- the 5 hypothetical that Your Honor posits, the better 6 answer -- at least our first submission would be, the 7 better answer is the headquarters would control. And 8 that's for a couple of reasons. 9 Although, again, the one exception that we 10 would have to our rule is exactly Your Honor's 11 hypothetical, and let me just bracket that. Now, the 12 reason we think, first and foremost -13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you have not 14 articulated a -- at least to me, a meaningful principle 15 in which to set that exception. It has to be tied 16 somehow to the test and why the test in some situations 17 would have applicability and others may not. 18 MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure. And let me -- let 19 me -20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because I don't know the 21 difference between one headquarters and two places to do 22 business or three, but I can still see that some 23 factoring has to be done when the places of business are 24 more limited. 25 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I -- well, we think
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 first and foremost that the headquarters' role would 2 apply even in Your Honor's situation, and I will get to 3 that to the exception -- fashioning the exception in 4 just one second -5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your case doesn't 6 call for that judgment, because you have a multistate 7 corporation, and it -- I assume you would be satisfied 8 with saying that when a corporation has dispersed 9 operations, it doesn't have its business center or its 10 headquarters -- doesn't have its business center 11 dominant in any one State, that it's dispersed, then you 12 take the headquarters, because there's no way to pick 13 among -- choose all the others, and it certainly isn't 14 worth the labor to try to do that. 15 So you could have a rule that says, 16 dispersed across many States, you pick headquarters. 17 And that -- you don't have to urge anything further. 18 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, absolutely, Justice 19 Ginsburg. And we would certainly accept the resolution 20 of the case in -- in that light. 21 If the Court were to announce a rule that 22 says, multistate corporations with diverse operations, 23 the principal place of business in that situation is the 24 headquarters, I think Your Honor is correct that 25 certainly we would prevail under that and that would be
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 entirely acceptable to us. But -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why would we say 3 that? Just because it wins your case and it solves your 4 problem? I mean, it seems to me, to do that, you 5 abandon your principal argument, which that -- which is 6 that "place" doesn't mean "State." 7 MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: And to talk about the whole 9 State of California as the principal place of doing 10 business -- I mean, if Congress meant that, it would 11 have said, the principal State in which business is 12 done. 13 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's -- that's correct, 14 Justice Scalia. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want to throw 16 away that good argument, do you? 17 (Laughter.) 18 MR. SRINIVASAN: We certainly don't want to 19 throw it away. We certainly don't want -- first and 20 foremost, we would like to prevail. And I think even 21 under the narrow approach -22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You would never get to 23 California's thing about State. If you say multistate, 24 you pick the place. The headquarters is the place, it's 25 within a State.
8

1 MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. And -- and that's why 2 we would accept that result, Justice Ginsburg. We 3 certainly would. Let me just put that out there first 4 and foremost. 5 Now, with respect to -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were you done with 7 your -- were you done with your answer to Justice 8 Sotomayor's hypothetical? 9 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't know that I, in 10 fact, started the answer, Mr. Chief Justice -11 (Laughter.) 12 MR. SRINIVASAN: -- with respect. 13 The answer is that even in that situation, 14 for the reasons that Justice Scalia highlights, we would 15 say that the headquarters controls. And let me give two 16 -- two principal reasons why. 17 The first is that even if the operations are 18 in one State and the headquarters are in a different 19 State, the headquarters still is where the direction and 20 control comes from. And I think the ordinary meaning of 21 the phrase "principal place of business" in that 22 situation would still direct attention to the 23 headquarters. 24 And the dictionary definitions that we 25 identified in -- in our brief and every Federal and
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 State law that defines the term "principal place of 2 business" defines it at headquarters -- as headquarters, 3 without any exception for the hypothetical situation 4 that Your Honor posits. But the other -5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what constitutes 6 headquarters? 7 MR. SRINIVASAN: I'm sorry? 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many executives have 9 to live there? What else has to exist there? And then 10 what is the default rule if those things don't exist? 11 MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. Your Honor, I think 12 -- and that -- that is the sort of different set of 13 questions which is other ambiguities with respect to the 14 definition of a headquarters in certain situations. 15 Now, by and large, the headquarters is 16 relatively straightforward. It's made in public filings 17 which are an easy place to look, and if you look at the 18 experience of the Seventh Circuit, which of course has 19 applied the headquarters approach across the board over 20 the course of several decades, I think we can see that 21 that test has been straightforward and it is simple in 22 application, in the main. 23 Now, that is not to say that there are not 24 issues about the definition of headquarters at the outer 25 perimeters. There are. And I think the place I would
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 look first and foremost is: Where does direction and 2 control for the corporation come from? That is the 3 situs at which the headquarters would be found. 4 And I would look also to what a corporation 5 itself identifies as headquarters in public filings. In 6 10-K filings and under the Model Business Corporations 7 Act, corporations have to report their headquarters in 8 annual reports. And of course they are doing those 9 reports for other reasons other than establishing 10 jurisdiction in a particular case, so I think they come 11 with an air of objectivity about them. That's where I 12 would look. 13 Now, I would make this other point, though, 14 about the ambiguity that Your Honor points to with 15 respect to the definition of a headquarters. That -16 that is not at all an ambiguity that only applies to our 17 test, because under Respondent's test and under the test 18 of every court of appeals, they take into account the 19 headquarters. 20 Now, we would think that that is 21 dispositive. The other courts consider it at least 22 highly relevant, albeit not dispositive. But whatever 23 ambiguities -24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why did the others all go 25 through some through total, totality of the factors
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 test? I mean, obviously, you could pick the 2 headquarters. You'd say Congress wanted one place; 3 headquarters is a logical choice, end of -- but most 4 circuits have made it more complicated than that. The 5 Seventh Circuit is the only one who said, keep it 6 simple, as you urge -- headquarters. 7 Why are the other circuits resistant to the 8 solution that you are proposing. 9 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, first in a situation 10 with a multistate corporation with dispersed operations, 11 as we point out in footnote 2 of our reply brief, I 12 think the courts of appeal are generally in agreement 13 that the headquarters would control in that situation. 14 Now, with respect to whether you would have 15 an across-the-board headquarters rule, Justice Ginsburg, 16 I think what happened is, the first court to consider 17 this question was the Third Circuit in the Scott case, 18 pretty soon after the statute was enacted in 1958. And 19 that court, with respect, didn't wrestle with the 20 ordinary meaning of the statutory terms, and it didn't 21 wrestle with the strong premium on simple and 22 administrable jurisdictional rules. And then that 23 doctrine sort of took on a life of its own, I think. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is it -- they -- they 25 do it in different ways.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. SRINIVASAN: They do. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Some say business 3 operations, some say headquarters. 4 MR. SRINIVASAN: There -- there is a variety 5 of different approaches. I think all of them share the 6 common feature that they consider, essentially, a 7 totality of the circumstances. And all of them, in our 8 view, share a common flaw, which is -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does -- how do the 10 bankruptcy courts do it? I mean, you brought out that 11 "principal place of business" was -- was a term that the 12 bankruptcy courts had been using before the amendment of 13 1332, 1958. But I -- I don't think that the -- that it 14 is inevitably headquarters for the bankruptcy courts. I 15 mean, there's -- sometimes it is in other places, isn't 16 it? 17 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, the bankruptcy courts 18 -- I think the fairest assessment of the bankruptcy 19 courts as of 1958 was that it was a model. 20 Now, since then, the Collier's treatise, for 21 example, would tell you that the majority and 22 predominant rule is the headquarters rule, even in the 23 bankruptcy context. Pre-1958, I think there was a 24 conflict. That's what the treatises said and that's 25 what we explain in our brief. But there certainly were
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 some courts that adopted a headquarters approach, even 2 in the bankruptcy context. 3 But I think one thing I would caution the 4 Court about is assuming that just because some courts in 5 the bankruptcy context, because of bankruptcy-specific 6 considerations -- and a specific consideration was the 7 felt need to have the assets of the bankrupt estate 8 within the purview of the court so that the court could 9 administer the estate -- that Congress would have wanted 10 to import every judicial application down to every 11 nuanced detail in the bankruptcy context over to the 12 jurisdictional context, where we know that Congress 13 thought that simplicity was a real virtue. 14 And I think, as Your Honor's opinion in 15 Wachovia v. Schmidt a few terms ago points out, there is 16 no reason to assume that Congress would have taken one 17 word in the venue context and applied the exact same 18 meaning to that same word in the jurisdictional context. 19 And here, because of the strong preference -- excuse me 20 -- in favor of simplicity and administrability in 21 jurisdictional rules, that is a particularly poignant 22 reason why the headquarters approach, in our -- in our 23 point of view, should govern in all circumstances. 24 Now -25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the case -- this is
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 purely hypothetical, but suppose Hertz were to be 2 bankrupt, file a petition in bankruptcy, where -- New 3 Jersey would be the place, on your -- or the assets are 4 dominantly someplace else, so it would be another place? 5 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think, if -- if 6 what you are asking, Justice Ginsburg, is, where would 7 the principal place of business be under the bankruptcy 8 statute, the majority rule now, under the Fifth Circuit 9 case Commonwealth Oil Refining and the Seventh Circuit 10 case Peachtree, would show that the majority rule now is 11 that the principal place of business would be New 12 Jersey. 13 And one point I would like to get to in that 14 regard is the sort of oddity of saying that the -- the 15 principal place of business of a company like Hertz 16 would be somewhere other than New Jersey. The Ninth 17 Circuit has a view that the principal place of business 18 of Hertz is California, based on the fact that Hertz 19 conducts 20 percent of its business in California. 20 But it is important to bear in mind that 21 this statute is a zero-sum game. So that if Hertz is 22 deemed to have its principal place of business in 23 California, such that it is disabled from getting access 24 to diversity jurisdiction in California, the consequence 25 is that Hertz would be enabled to gain diversity
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 jurisdiction in every other State -- and I'm putting to 2 one side Delaware, the State of incorporation -- but it 3 would be enabled to gain access to -- to diversity 4 jurisdiction in every other State. 5 So the consequence would be that if Hertz 6 were sued in a State court action in Park Ridge, New 7 Jersey, the site of its headquarters, Hertz could get 8 Federal court jurisdiction in that jurisdiction on the 9 theory that it's an out-of-State company, it's a 10 California company, because it performs 20 percent of 11 its business in California. 12 Now that -- the oddity of that, in our view, 13 is particularly poignant if one takes into account a 14 company like Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is universally 15 recognized to be an Arkansas corporation because it is 16 headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, but Wal-Mart 17 also, it's undisputed, does substantially more business 18 by any of the measures that the Ninth Circuit considers 19 significant in Texas. It has more employees there; it 20 has more stores there; it generates more revenues there, 21 by a significant factor well in excess of 50 percent 22 over and above any other State. 23 But the consequence of deeming Wal-Mart a 24 Texas corporation based on the amount of business it 25 does in Texas would be not only that Wal-Mart would be
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 disabled from getting Federal court jurisdiction in 2 Texas, but that Wal-Mart would be enabled to get Federal 3 court jurisdiction in Bentonville, Arkansas, on the 4 theory that even in Arkansas, Wal-Mart would be an 5 out-of-State corporation, a Texas corporation, because 6 of the level of business that it conducts in Texas. 7 And we don't think that is the result that 8 Congress would have envisioned in 1958 when it enacted 9 the Principal Place of Business provision. Instead, 10 what Congress presumably had in mind is that 11 corporations, as a general matter, are identified with 12 the location of their headquarters. 13 So in the Wal-Mart situation, Wal-Mart 14 rightly is universally acknowledged to be an Arkansas 15 corporation because of the presence in that State of its 16 headquarters. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, all you are 18 talking about is not necessarily nerve center, because 19 in reading the examples in your brief, what you are 20 talking about is: Where is the place where they have 21 the most important, significant, influential contact? 22 Now, the Ninth Circuit has defined that as 23 the place where business is done; you are suggesting 24 that it's the place where the nerve center is. But it 25 goes back to begging my question: Why -- just simply
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 their declaring it on a tax form doesn't make it 2 important, influential, or significant contact. There 3 has to be something more to the test, and it can't be 4 just what I declare my headquarters to be. There has to 5 be some form of activity in that place. 6 MR. SRINIVASAN: There does, Your Honor, and 7 we think -- I guess the -- the comparison I would make 8 is to an individual, because an individual can't declare 9 that he or she is a domiciliary of a particular State 10 and have it be so for citizenship purposes. There has 11 to be something behind that, and so too with 12 corporations. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -- that's the 14 point. 15 MR. SRINIVASAN: Exactly, and we -- we share 16 that view. A corporation couldn't simply declare that 17 its headquarters are located in a -- in a location where 18 it has a mailbox, for example, and have that be 19 dispositive for citizenship purposes. What -20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there -- is there 21 something to a rule that says headquarters is 22 presumptively the nerve center, but a challenged party, 23 whoever that is, can rebut it? 24 MR. SRINIVASAN: I think certainly it would 25 be a vast improvement over what the Ninth Circuit has.
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 So I would say that as a starting point, Your Honor. I 2 think -- in our view, of course, a principal submission 3 is the headquarters controls in all -- in all 4 situations, and the cost of having, you know, a 5 rebuttable presumption would be: What does it take to 6 rebut it? That would be question. And I think-7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the point 8 that I raised, which is that the headquarters is not an 9 important, consequential, or substantial. You can rebut 10 it if you can show that it is a shell headquarters. 11 MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. And I think in that 12 situation, I guess -- I guess there is two different 13 ways that one could look at that. One is to say that 14 you could rebut it, but the other is to say that it is 15 not the headquarters. 16 And I guess that's the way that I would look 17 at it, is to say that if the corporation identifies a 18 location at which it in fact doesn't direct and control 19 the operations of the corporation throughout, it 20 wouldn't constitute the headquarters. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but -22 MR. SRINIVASAN: So I guess that's where I 23 would place the load-bearing weight. It may be 24 semantic, but -25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the problem,
19

1 which is, the party comes in, alleges by summary 2 judgment that -- in a summary judgment motion: This is 3 my corporate headquarters. The other side's going to 4 have to come forth with evidence that shows something. 5 MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. And if -- and -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that it's always a 7 rebuttable presumption. 8 MR. SRINIVASAN: There is, Your Honor, and 9 if the other side were able to show that the location 10 that the party identifies as -- as its headquarters does 11 not, in fact, function as a headquarters, in the sense 12 that suppose there is no executives there, or suppose 13 that the officials that are there in fact don't direct 14 and control the company's operations in other locations. 15 Well, then, that -- that would be a real issue. 16 But there are checks against that, because 17 corporations identify their headquarters in other public 18 filings, and in the main, those headquarters are the 19 locations in -- from which the chief executives direct 20 and control the companies' operations -21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I actually do not know 22 whether public filings define what "headquarters" mean. 23 Is there a -- I know you have said it in your brief, but 24 what I didn't know is whether those public filings 25 define the activity necessary to designate a place as
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 "headquarters." 2 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, they -- they do in 3 the following sense, Your Honor. For example, with the 4 10-K report for publicly traded companies, I think the 5 question that is asked is not the location of the 6 headquarters but the location of the principal executive 7 offices. And so I think, by definition, in answering 8 that question the principal executives would be located 9 at that -- at that location. Now, if they weren't, we 10 would certainly take Your Honor's point that there could 11 be a back-and-forth about that, but that -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I know, but didn't 13 Congress pick "a principal place of business"? And we 14 know that they looked at the bankruptcy courts. There 15 are lots of expressions in other statutes. Some say 16 "headquarters." Some say -- well, there are a variety 17 of things, but Congress picked this particular term, 18 "principal place of business." 19 And I was thinking, when you gave the 20 example of Texas, that the idea of diversity is you are 21 not going to get a Federal forum where you are at home. 22 And so one would think, well, if Wal-Mart is doing so 23 much in Texas, it's really no stranger in Texas. Why 24 shouldn't there be diversity in Texas? 25 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, in -- in response to
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the latter point, Your Honor, I think the one thing we 2 do know from 1958 is that Congress didn't think that a 3 corporation should be disabled from getting diversity 4 jurisdiction anywhere where it does a substantial 5 business, because it had that proposal before it, and it 6 rejected it. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It rejected it, yes. 8 MR. SRINIVASAN: It instead chose an 9 approach whereby a company is disabled from getting 10 diversity jurisdiction in one, and only one, 11 jurisdiction, the jurisdiction in which it has its 12 principal place of business. 13 And I think what Congress had in mind is 14 that corporations, as a general matter, are identified 15 with their headquarters. And that is why Wal-Mart, for 16 example, is universally recognized as an Arkansas 17 company. It may be that Wal-Mart does substantial 18 business in Texas, substantially in excess of other 19 States, but Wal-Mart also does substantial business in a 20 variety of jurisdictions. But Congress decidedly didn't 21 have the rule that says wherever Wal-Mart does a 22 substantial business and is a well recognized company, 23 it should be disabled from getting to Federal court. It 24 limited it to one jurisdiction. 25 And we think the best reading of the phrase
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 "principal place of business" is the situs of the 2 headquarters in that there were -- with -- with respect 3 to the bankruptcy decisions, Your Honor, there -- there 4 were bankruptcy courts that did have a "headquarters" 5 approach. And, in fact, the one bankruptcy court of 6 which I am aware that looked at the meaning of the 7 ordinary language -- we cite the -- the relevant -- the 8 portion of the court's opinion at page 50 of our opening 9 brief in footnote 5. It is the First Circuit's opinion 10 in the Burdick case. 11 And what the First Circuit said was that a 12 corporation's, quote, "principal office," rather than a 13 factory, mill or mine, according to ordinary 14 understanding and speech, constitutes the principal 15 place of business within the meaning of the Bankruptcy 16 Code." 17 And so even before 1958, I think there was 18 definitely a sense out there that the term "principal 19 place of business" does mean headquarters. And this 20 gets to Your Honor's other question which is: If 21 Congress really meant "headquarters," why wouldn't they 22 have used the term "headquarters" instead of "principal 23 place of business"? 24 And I think our answer to that, with respect 25 to Your Honor, is that "principal place of business" is
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 an alternative formulation for "headquarters." And so I 2 don't think one can glean too much from the fact that 3 Congress chose "principal place of business" rather than 4 "headquarters" when "principal place of business" in our 5 view is a reference to the headquarters. 6 And this Court's opinion last term in the 7 Oswell Harlow versus United States case is a good 8 example of that, because there the statute that was at 9 issue used the term "facilitate" rather than the term 10 "aid or abet." And one could have readily made the 11 argument that because the statute uses the term 12 "facilitate" rather than "aid or abet," that normal 13 principles that accompany aiding and abetting liability 14 shouldn't apply in the statute. But the Court rightly 15 in our view reached the contrary conclusion, and it was 16 based on the notion that the term "facilitate," 17 according to Black's Law Dictionary, means the very same 18 thing as "aid or abet." And once you cross that bridge, 19 then you can apply aiding or abetting principles to the 20 term "facilitate." 21 And here, likewise, the term "principal 22 place of business," according to Black's Law Dictionary, 23 means "headquarters." That's how Black's Law Dictionary 24 defines the term. And so the fact that Congress chose 25 one alternate formulation versus another, I don't think

SRINIVASAN: Sure, and -- and, again, I 6 would look at the public filings. In the public filings 7 in the 10-K, for example, Hertz universally identifies 8 its headquarters as Park Ridge, New Jersey. And the 9 reason is that the chief executive officials are all 10 located in Park Ridge. 11 Now, there is a large administrative 12 apparatus in Oklahoma City, and, according to the 13 affidavit, its administrative activities are performed 14 in Oklahoma City to a lesser extent. And that is at 15 paragraph 11 of the affidavit, which is at pages 29a to 16 30a of the appendix to the petition. 17 But I don't think there is any real dispute 18 that Hertz's main headquarters are located in Park Ridge 19 rather than Oklahoma City. In point of fact, what you 20 have in Oklahoma City -- and -- and this isn't spelled 21 out in the -- in the affidavit, but what you have in 22 Oklahoma City is essentially the rental call center and 23 plus principal back-office duties like information 24 technology support. But what you have in Park Ridge is 25 all of the company's chief executives. So the decision-

1 making locus for the company's most important decisions 2 is absolutely in Park Ridge, New Jersey, rather than 3 Oklahoma City. And there is no dispute on the point 4 that is before the Court. 5 This Court comes -- this case comes to the 6 Court on the assumption that Hertz's headquarters are 7 located in Park Ridge. The question for the Court is 8 whether that headquarters location should be dispositive 9 for purposes of defining a company's principal place of 10 business. 11 Now, if I could -- if I could turn for one 12 moment to the cost in terms of simplicity and 13 demonstrability of an alternative formulation if the 14 Court were to accommodate a formulation that didn't look 15 to the headquarters, we see three potential categories 16 of costs that are brought about by the -- the proposed 17 approach of Respondents in what the Ninth Circuit has 18 established. 19 The first is the one that underlies the 20 strong preference in favor of simple, demonstrable, 21 jurisdictional rules. And that is just the time and 22 resources that would be invested at the threshold 23 jurisdictional stage in defining whether the case is -24 is before the proper court. That in itself is reason 25 enough, in our view --

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Not all diversity suits 2 have major law firms in them and a lot of resources to 3 spend in -- in discovery to determine more complex 4 tests. 5 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. Yes, that's 6 our point, Justice Kennedy, and I think a "headquarters" 7 test is simple and straightforward in that respect, and 8 a "totality of circumstances" approach isn't. But there 9 is also two additional costs that I would point out 10 about a "totality of circumstances" approach. 11 One is that you can have the very real 12 possibility because of the indeterminacy in that 13 approach that different courts would reach divergent 14 conclusions about the citizenship of the very same 15 corporation. And as we point out on page 40 of our 16 brief, that has already happened. Two district courts 17 in the Ninth Circuit alone in two California courts 18 reached divergent conclusions on the citizenship of 19 United Airlines. One court concluded that United was an 20 Illinois citizen, and another court concluded that 21 United was a California citizen. And that is not 22 altogether surprising that you would have those sorts of 23 divergent conclusions given the open-ended nature of the 24 "totality of circumstances" approach. 25 The third cost that I would point to is the
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 possibility that because of the indeterminacy in the 2 approach you could have a situation in which a district 3 court finds there is jurisdiction, proceeds to have a 4 trial on the merits and renders -- renders judgment on 5 the merits, and then several years later the court of 6 appeals would reverse the judgment because the district 7 court had gotten the jurisdictional input wrong at the 8 outset. And, again, that also, as with the situation 9 with divergent conclusions on the citizenship of the 10 same corporation, is not just a problem of theory. It 11 has actually happened. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even -- even when the 13 direct -- the -- even subject-matter jurisdiction is 14 precluded after final -- final judgment after direct -15 so that's nothing new. It is the same example you gave. 16 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think -- I guess my 17 point is that precisely because subject-matter 18 jurisdiction can be raised at any point -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not any point in the 20 direct -- up to denial of cert on direct review. After 21 that it's precluded, even subject-matter jurisdiction. 22 You can't collaterally attack on that basis. 23 MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure, right. I guess what 24 my point is that you could have a situation where a 25 trial court has reached a resolution on the merits.

1 Several years -- several years later the court of 2 appeals on direct review would reach the conclusion that 3 the district court got it wrong on subject-matter 4 jurisdiction. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 6 MR. SRINIVASAN: And there is a case that we 7 cite in our brief, the Diaz -- Diaz versus Pep Boys 8 case, that involve that situation. 9 If the Court has no further questions, I 10 would like to reserve the balance of my time. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 12 Mr. Schneider? 13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD M. SCHNEIDER 14 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 15 MR. SCHNEIDER: Thank you. Mr. Chief 16 Justice, and may it please the Court: 17 For 50 years every circuit save the -- save 18 the Seventh had agreed -- has agreed on one overriding 19 principle: That courts must perform a balancing in 20 determining the principal place of business of a 21 corporation, and that balancing must include a 22 determination of where the corporation's people and 23 property are. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is -- is that a fair 25 description of what the Ninth Circuit did here? Did
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 they perform a balancing, or did they look solely to 2 where most of the sales were? 3 MR. SCHNEIDER: The -- the Ninth Circuit 4 specifically in this case noted that 43 percent more 5 employees for Hertz are in California, 75 percent more 6 property, 60 percent more revenue, and -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: More than -- more than 8 what, more than any other single State? 9 MR. SCHNEIDER: That's correct, Justice 10 Scalia. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't say the -12 the "principal State of business." It's the "principal 13 place of business." Is there a difference between the 14 two? 15 MR. SCHNEIDER: I think I have two answers 16 to that, Your Honor. The first answer is that Congress 17 was using a term of art that was imported from the 18 Bankruptcy Code. 19 In all of the Bankruptcy Code cases prior to 20 1958, the 11 USC 11 cases take an aggregation approach 21 when they look at it State-by-State, so, if we raise 22 principal place of business as a term of art that 23 Congress imported into this statute, then we have to 24 look at an aggregated State-by-State approach. 25 The other answer, I think, is more of a
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 semantic answer, which is how did Congress define the 2 word "place"? Certainly, the English language provides 3 that a place can be a building, as Hertz would have, or 4 a place could be a State, as we -- my place of birth, 5 for example, is New York State. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why -- why didn't they 7 say place of doing business? That's not the terminology 8 that they used. 9 MR. SCHNEIDER: They didn't, and Congress 10 was -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That would be more 12 consistent with an aggregation of -- of all of the 13 factors the Ninth Circuit starts with. 14 MR. SCHNEIDER: Your Honor, Congress chose 15 the phrase "principal place of business" because, to 16 quote the legislative history, there were many cases on 17 the books, and it was an easily understood phrase. 18 I think what Congress intended to do was to 19 not have us end up here, to take a phrase which was 20 known in the case law and to import it -21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, what's very 22 clear from all of the articles I have read in the lower 23 court decisions is that Congress may have thought it was 24 picking a well-defined phrase, but, in fact, it wasn't, 25 that the Courts below are confused about what they were
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 doing before the statute. 2 So I don't know why importing the belief 3 that something was clear into a reality that it's not 4 helps us. 5 MR. SCHNEIDER: Your Honor, in answer to 6 Justice Scalia's question, I believe it was clear, from 7 all of the case law, that we were talking about place 8 equalling an aggregation of all of the activity in the 9 State. 10 With regard to your question, we have cited 11 in our brief two district court opinions that performed 12 a scholarly review of all of the case law at the time 13 that Congress passed the 1958 amendments. Particularly 14 of import is the Inland Rubber case. 15 And what the court found in the Inland 16 Rubber case is, while there was two lines of thinking, 17 there was the -- what came to be known as the nerve 18 center line of thinking and what came to be known as the 19 business reality line of thinking. 20 The nerve center test could almost all be 21 explained by the fact that, in those cases, the 22 corporation only had one place of business, there were 23 some outliers, but for the most part, the two judges, in 24 the Gilardi case and in the Inland Rubber case -25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why do you -- why do
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 you think that the circuits courts -- the vast majority 2 of them, the third, the first, the second, the fifth, 3 they all start with the proposition that, if a place has 4 far-flung businesses, then the nerve center test should 5 start the inquiry and control it more than in a 6 situation where there are lesser places of business? 7 MR. SCHNEIDER: Yes. That's the total 8 activities test, Your Honor, and the total activities 9 test would put initial weight on the nerve center, but 10 if one -- and then, of course, weigh whether or not 11 there is a substantial predominance of all of -- of all 12 of the other factors somewhere in the country, which, 13 frankly, is not a lot different than the Ninth Circuit 14 case -- test. 15 The Ninth Circuit simply does it in the 16 other way. It asks -17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's a big 18 difference. 19 MR. SCHNEIDER: It asks the same question, 20 whether or not there is a -- a substantial 21 predominance -- finds substantial predominance, not just 22 predominance, but substantial predominance. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- you know, to me, 24 the word "substantial" usually means closer to 50 25 percent. I'm having a hard time understanding what the
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 appreciable difference is between 20 percent and 14 and 2 the balance being spread over so many other places. 3 What -- that seems very arbitrary in terms 4 of the place that generates the most money. That's it. 5 That's the place you are at home. 6 MR. SCHNEIDER: I think, to understand it, 7 one must look at the purpose of diversity. The real 8 question is, is diversity to be used as a sword by a 9 corporation, such that a corporation can choose its 10 place of diversity jurisdiction, or is it a shield to 11 protect the corporation, a truly foreign corporation, 12 from local bias? 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that's what -14 but that goes back to the point, if we are talking about 15 shields or swords, Congress had before it a provision 16 that would say, anywhere you do business, you are not a 17 foreigner, because you are there. The people are going 18 to perceive you as a business -- the local business that 19 is doing business in that location, and Congress 20 rejected that. 21 So foreign has to have a meaning that was 22 somewhat different. And you don't think the corporate 23 headquarters where management is, where the direction 24 for the operation of the business is coming from, is the 25 place that needs the most protection in this system
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 because they are the ones making the decisions, and so 2 aren't they the ones who need to be protected from local 3 bias? 4 MR. SCHNEIDER: Courts have found that 5 corporations are best known where they have most of 6 their people and their property. That's because 7 employees go out in the community, property is bought 8 and sold in the community, so the local people will know 9 the corporation more where they have their people and 10 property than, necessarily, where they have the 11 headquarters. 12 Until this case began, I had no idea where 13 Hertz headquarters are. There is many corporations in 14 the State of California, that I have no idea are 15 headquartered in the State of California. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The problem with your -17 your approach -- and California is unique in this 18 respect, is -- California is a very large State, lots of 19 business, and you are comparing to the next State that 20 has the next number of employees -- you know, Florida. 21 If I were entertaining your approach, I 22 would think, well, you would compare California against 23 the whole rest of the nation and not pick for a 24 dispersed -- a corporation that is widely dispersed. 25 California is going to be the big winner in
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 this. It's going to be able to keep all those cases in 2 its State court because so many multi-State 3 corporations, I imagine, would come out, just the way 4 Hertz does. 5 Am I right, that, under your analysis, the 6 one place where, if you say, we don't want Federal 7 courts to be dealing with corporations that are at home 8 in the State, but in the State of New Jersey, under your 9 view of things, a New Jersey citizen could sue Hertz in 10 Federal court in New Jersey, right? 11 MR. SCHNEIDER: That is correct, Your Honor, 12 unless, of course, Hertz were to change its place of 13 incorporation to New Jersey. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And why do you say, 15 well -- why is it that the Ninth Circuit's method, 16 California versus Florida, instead of California and 17 let's see what the rest of the business is -- is, in the 18 whole United States? 19 MR. SCHNEIDER: I think the answer, Justice 20 Ginsburg, to that question goes back to how the phrase 21 "principal place of business" was looked at under the 22 Bankruptcy Code, and in the Bankruptcy Code, it was, in 23 fact, a State-by-State analysis, rather than a State 24 versus country analysis. 25 Now, Justice Ginsburg, you asked me, did it
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 mean that all corporations were going to end up being 2 California corporations? California -- the Ninth 3 Circuit has been doing it this way for 50 years. Every 4 other circuit has had -- save the seventh -- has had 5 some balancing test for 50 years, and it has not come to 6 pass that all corporations are California corporations. 7 A matter of fact, if you think of a 8 corporation that sells skis, they are likely going to be 9 a Colorado corporation, or they are going to be a Utah 10 corporation. A -- a corporation that sells mining 11 equipment is likely to end up in West Virginia or one of 12 the mining States. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand why, 14 somehow, a Californian is more likely to identify with 15 Hertz, simply because there are more Californians and, 16 hence, more Hertz outlets, than a New Jerseyite is 17 likely to identify with Hertz. 18 Per capita, there are probably as many Hertz 19 outlets in New Jersey as there are in California. The 20 only reason that you come up with California is it's an 21 enormous State. It has 10 percent of the population. 22 But as far as the citizens of the State 23 identifying with that -- with that company and, 24 therefore, the unfairness of -- of letting that 25 company -- you know, remove to Federal court, New Jersey
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and California are absolutely the same. 2 MR. SCHNEIDER: Congress made a decision in 3 rejecting the any place where you are doing business 4 test, that it would not prevent corporations from 5 removing cases in any State where they are doing 6 business. 7 The question in diversity jurisdiction is 8 not whether or not a corporation should be allowed to 9 use the Federal forum to decide if that's the best forum 10 for it, but the question is a different one. Will there 11 be bias in the -- in the State court? 12 And because Hertz does so much business in 13 California, it's hard to argue that we bias by being in 14 the State court in California. Remember, this case -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they cannot be 16 advised by the State court in New Jersey either. The -17 you correctly pointed out that Congress said place of 18 business. It didn't even do as it did with -- it didn't 19 do as it did with -- with corporate citizenship, that is 20 you could be a citizenship of as many States as you 21 incorporate in. But if it's got to be one place, so why 22 not just keep it simple and say presumptively it's the 23 business headquarters, in a particular case you could 24 show otherwise. 25 MR. SCHNEIDER: Congress had two goals,
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Justice Ginsburg. The first goal was to prevent gaming 2 of the system. The simplest test is also the most 3 easily -4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that would be a phony 5 headquarters. But nobody is suggesting that -- that the 6 headquarters of Hertz in New Jersey, that that's a sham 7 set-up. 8 MR. SCHNEIDER: But even a -- even a real 9 headquarters wouldn't prevent gaming of the system. 10 If -- if a corporation truly wanted to stay out of State 11 court in a State where it was doing significant 12 business, even all of their business under Hertz' test, 13 they would only have to actually move their headquarters 14 out of that State. 15 There is a second reason that Congress 16 passed the '58 amendment -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that phenomenon? I 18 mean, I can see that as a hypothetical, but does it 19 happen in the real world, that a corporation moves its 20 headquarters in order to escape the Federal courts in a 21 particular State? 22 MR. SCHNEIDER: Because the test is only a 23 Seventh Circuit test, it wouldn't do any good for a 24 corporation -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it is one of the
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 factors in other -- in other states as well. It's part 2 of the totality of the circumstances. You certainly 3 increase your odds to move your headquarters. 4 MR. SCHNEIDER: It would, but it wouldn't be 5 dispositive. We do know that corporations move for all 6 sorts of economic reasons. They move for tax reasons, 7 they move because -8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why would they move 9 simply to avoid a Federal court or to gain access to the 10 Federal court in a particular State? 11 MR. SCHNEIDER: There is -- as witnessed by 12 congressional findings in the Class Action Fairness Act, 13 there is a perception that State courts in certain 14 States are not good for corporations. Whether that -15 that perception is a real perception or whether it's not 16 a real perception isn't before us today. 17 But if a corporation has all of its people 18 and all of its property and is doing all of its business 19 in one of those States, the corporation shouldn't be 20 allowed to game the system by simply moving its 21 headquarters, it's real headquarters out of that State. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we are not talking 23 about all. I mean, that would be -- that's why you make 24 it a presumption, the headquarters is a presumption 25 which could be rebutted. But you are not talking about
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 all business. You are talking about California where 2 there is a sizeable amount of business, simply because 3 it's the size of the State, the population of the State. 4 And I would understand your position better 5 if you would say, well, we would measure against the 6 entirety of the United States. But California is going 7 to come out the winner much more often than any other 8 State under this test simply because of its size. 9 MR. SCHNEIDER: With respect, Justice 10 Ginsburg, I don't believe that the case law has borne 11 that out. Again, I have read no studies that say 12 corporations are more often California citizens simply 13 because of the population of California -- that doesn't 14 mean that the study hasn't exist -- doesn't exist. I 15 simply haven't read it. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't worry about 17 private individuals gaming the system, do we, by -- you 18 know, in -- in order to get into or out of Federal 19 court, establishing residence in a different State? We 20 don't worry about them gaming the system, do we? 21 MR. SCHNEIDER: We do, Justice Scalia. 22 There is a fact-intensive test for citizenship for 23 individuals based on their intent to stay in a place. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. But -- but you can 25 have a genuine intent to go somewhere else, and I don't
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 know that people do it for foreign reasons because they 2 want to get in or out of Federal court. You really 3 don't worry about that, it seems to me. 4 MR. SCHNEIDER: I do believe it is less 5 likely that an individual would either have the 6 sophistication or, frankly, the litigation volume to 7 make such a decision? But a corporation may, in fact. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I know some rich 9 individuals that might have the incentive. 10 MR. SCHNEIDER: I would like to turn, if I 11 may, to the second reason that Congress passed the '58 12 amendment and that was because of the notion of 13 overcrowding of the Federal docket because too many 14 diversity cases -- because there were too many diversity 15 cases because most litigation was happening far away 16 from the facts. 17 Suits involving corporations generally arise 18 where they have a lot of contacts with the public, where 19 there people are and where their property are. If we 20 allow a corporation to move all of its litigation where 21 the bulk of its people and property are to Federal 22 court, Congress's second goal -23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Schneider, can I just 24 inject this thought? It goes back to Justice Kennedy's 25 question. I don't think we are concerned about the
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 defendants gaming the system. I think one other very 2 important concern is plaintiffs sometimes in small 3 communities want to sue somebody, and sometimes they 4 would much rather be in Federal court, because sometimes 5 the judges are better than the local judges, and so 6 forth. So there are a lot of reasons why plaintiffs 7 want to get into Federal courts. 8 And it seems to me it's important to have a 9 rule that makes it easy for the plaintiff to decide what 10 is the citizenship of the defendant, can I get into 11 Federal court or not. And I see it as a great argument 12 in favor of a very simple rule to benefit plaintiffs. 13 MR. SCHNEIDER: The -- again, for 50 years, 14 Justice Stevens, plaintiffs and plaintiffs' lawyers have 15 been able to under the various tests figure out where 16 corporations are citizens. 17 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you must acknowledge 18 that it's a lot easier for a plaintiff -- there is some 19 place to get on the internet and say where is their 20 principal place and they get a simple answer. If you 21 get a question, well, I got to analyze their business 22 all over the country to decide, that's a formidable 23 obstacle for a -- for a plaintiff to overcome. 24 MR. SCHNEIDER: It may or may not be, 25 depending upon the corporation. The vast majority of
43

1 corporations are local corporations, so we are really 2 just talking about -3 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- of an interstate 4 business who are commonly defendants in a lot of 5 lawsuits -- in a personal injury suit, and the question 6 is, can I easily decide what the place of incorporation 7 of that defendant is. 8 MR. SCHNEIDER: That's correct, Justice 9 Stevens. And because most of those entities are public 10 corporations, there is a lot of information available in 11 FCC filings, et cetera, as to where they are actually 12 doing business. You can also simply look out your door 13 and figure out whether have I seen a lot of Hertz 14 outlets where I am. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is -- under 16 the Ninth Circuit test, where is -- what is the 17 principal place of business of Starbucks? 18 MR.

But over -- that's correct, Your Honor. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the very first 7 little shop was there. 8 MR. SCHNEIDER: That's my understanding, 9 yes. However, over 100 percent more workers from 10 Starbucks are in California than Washington. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me what 12 100 percent means? Are the number of workers in Seattle 13 inconsequential? Is there one worker there or are we 14 talking about 1,000 in -15 MR. SCHNEIDER: I don't know the total 16 numbers of the workers. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that important? 18 As Justice Scalia said that per capita California is 19 going to dwarf anybody anywhere if you are going to have 20 a multi-location place of business. So don't you have 21 to know the raw numbers? 22 MR. SCHNEIDER: I -- I don't know the raw 23 numbers from Starbucks, I'm sorry. I just read the 24 opinion. And what the opinion tells us is that 25 Starbucks has 10 percent of its employees in Washington
45

1 and 27 percent in California. Over 300 percent more of 2 its gross revenue comes from California than any other 3 State, 200 percent more of its retail stores are in 4 California than in any other State. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about, I guess, 6 mail order houses? I mean, what's the principal place 7 of business of Eddie Bauer? 8 MR. SCHNEIDER: It would -- it would be, 9 Your Honor, wherever there is a substantial predominance 10 of its people and property. I would assume -- and I 11 don't know the facts of Eddie Bauer, but I would assume 12 Eddie Bauer has a central location from which it does 13 its sales, which it does its factory work, where it is 14 shipping things from. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would -- would it 16 make a difference if, say -- it may well be the case, 30 17 percent of their business is in California? 18 MR. SCHNEIDER: No. But by business you 19 mean revenue, Your Honor? 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 21 MR. SCHNEIDER: The test we posit, Your 22 Honor, focuses on people and property.
