1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:09 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Our last argument of 4 the term is in Case 10-568, Nevada Commission on Ethics 5 v. Carrigan. 6 Mr. Elwood. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. ELWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 Neutral laws requiring official recusal for 12 conflict of interest do not abridge free speech because 13 a legislator's vote, however expressive, is not 14 protected speech. It is, rather, a legally binding 15 exercise of State power that he wields as an incident of 16 public office. 17 The Nevada Supreme Court concluded that 18 Respondent did have a free speech right to vote, and 19 that overrode the Nevada recusal statute. For four 20 reasons, that holding was error. 21 First, since the earliest days of the 22 Republic recusal rules have been understood to serve 23 important interests unrelated to any views a legislator 24 may want to express, by requiring disqualification when 25 circumstances indicate that private interests may have
3

1 affected his independence of judgment. 2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the -- the case 3 is -- is presented to us with briefs that seem to pass 4 in the night. Your emphasis was on whether or not there 5 was a right to vote that's protected under the First 6 Amendment, and -- which is what the Nevada court held 7 and you're quite correct to address it. But the 8 Respondent says: Well, this interest has a chilling 9 effect on -- on protected speech. I think we have to 10 reach both parts of that argument. 11 Do you -- DO you agree with me? 12 MR. ELWOOD: I think that the Court could 13 simply address what the Nevada Supreme Court did and 14 tell it whether it got it right or got it wrong, whether 15 there's a speech interest, and what -- whether that is 16 subject to strict scrutiny or not. 17 But I think that, even though that argument 18 I don't think was raised or passed on below, that the 19 Court would have discretion to address that. I think it 20 would give additional guidance to the Nevada Supreme 21 Court. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if we -- if we say 23 that intermediate scrutiny is the test, even under that 24 test, certainly under that test, the regulation cannot 25 chill speech any more than necessary to fulfill the
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 governmental interests, even under the intermediate 2 standard. 3 MR. ELWOOD: I - 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and it just seems 5 to me it's difficult for it to just address the standard 6 of proof without deciding the case. Maybe you're right. 7 Maybe we can just answer the -- the question that was 8 certified and -- and send it back, if -- if you prevail. 9 I'm not sure. 10 MR. ELWOOD: I think -- I think you're 11 right, Justice Kennedy, that it would provide more 12 guidance to the Nevada Supreme Court. It would be a 13 pretty narrow reversal and remand, assuming that the 14 Court merely reached the speech question. 15 But on the associational question, I think 16 it's important to emphasize from the outset that I think 17 this would have a negligible effect on association, 18 because it simply would not apply all that frequently. 19 In order for the recusal statute to apply, two 20 circumstances have to be simultaneously met. First, 21 there has to be a qualifying relationship which is close 22 and ongoing, and simultaneously it must have the -- it 23 must -- the third party must have a private, usually 24 pecuniary, interest before that same legislator. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: As I understand the
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 objection, it's not to the recusal rules in general, but 2 it's to the vagueness of this particular one. As I 3 understand it, there's no concern about the specific 4 categories that were mentioned, like family member or 5 employer. 6 MR. ELWOOD: That is correct, Justice - 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So we're dealing not with 8 can you have recusal rules. Everybody believes, yes, 9 you can. It's the degree of specificity. 10 MR. ELWOOD: Well, that was the basis of the 11 holding of the Nevada Supreme Court, was that those 12 implicated speech rights and that all of them would be 13 subject to strict scrutiny. So from the outset, we may 14 all be agreed that the court below applied fundamentally 15 too high a level of scrutiny. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the -- the objection 17 to the statute on the grounds that it's vague doesn't go 18 away simply because intermediate scrutiny applies, does 19 it, assuming intermediate scrutiny? 20 MR. ELWOOD: No, but I think that the -- our 21 response to the vagueness argument is that Respondent 22 concedes that the four categories for members of your 23 households, relatives, employers, and business 24 relationships are clear. He says that on page 2 of his 25 brief. So the question is whether the "substantially
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 similar" language gums up the works, essentially. 2 Now, "substantially similar" is a statutory 3 phrase that has had to have been used by every State 4 legislature in the country and by Congress. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not in this context. 6 And you don't disagree that -- I forgot which brief told 7 us that there's no State has a similar catch-all. 8 MR. ELWOOD: Well, first, I would disagree 9 with the characterization of it as a catch-all, because 10 it only sweeps in relationships that are substantially 11 similar. But Seattle, for example, has a, what is a 12 true catch-all, which sweeps in -- it applies "whenever 13 it could appear to a reasonable person having knowledge 14 of the relevant circumstances that the covered 15 individual's judgment is impaired because of either a 16 personal or business relationship not covered under 17 subsection A or B above," which lists the covered 18 relationships, "or a transaction or activity engaged in 19 by the covered individual." 20 So while Nevada may be the only statute that 21 applies "substantially similar" to these four 22 categories, it is not alone in that structure. And I 23 think more importantly, it is not anywhere close to 24 alone in its breadth. The New Jersey statute is I 25 think, if anything, broader: "A direct or indirect
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 financial or personal involvement." There are numerous 2 State statutes which apply to business associates. 3 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I found this statute 4 very difficult to understand, but maybe you can explain 5 what's -- what I found a bit puzzling. The statute 6 talks about a commitment in a private capacity to the 7 interests of others. 8 Now, I take it that that commitment doesn't 9 have to be something contractual. When you're talking 10 about relatives, that would assume -- that that would 11 include emotional commitments to the relatives who are 12 listed; is that correct? 13 MR. ELWOOD: I think it would include the 14 things -- the same things that are covered by 15 ordinary -- every other recusal statute, which is very 16 close personal relationships and relationships that give 17 rise to a financial interest on the -- for the public 18 official. And we're not talking about, you know - 19 JUSTICE ALITO: Not -- not a financial 20 interest of the public official, a financial interest of 21 the -- the relative or the person who is substantially 22 similar to a relative. Or is that wrong? 23 MR. ELWOOD: Well, I think that in the case 24 of the relative, yes, it's the financial interest of the 25 relative, and that's why the very close personal
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 relationship. But all of the other relationships for 2 members of the household, who are presumably part of the 3 same economic unit, and for employers, in whom the 4 officer has obviously a very close financial interest 5 and they're tied together, and for business 6 relationships, all of those are to get at the financial 7 interests of the officer, not of the third party. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: Maybe if I give you an 9 example it will be clearer. Let's take somebody who is 10 within the third degree of consanguinity. So that would 11 include second cousins? 12 MR. ELWOOD: Yes. 13 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. Now, let's say a 14 public officer is considering something that would 15 affect everybody's property taxes in town or a measure 16 that would affect the benefits or the wages of everybody 17 who works for the town. And this official has a second 18 cousin whose property taxes would be affected or works 19 for the town, and the second cousin's wages or benefits 20 would be affected. Now, would that person have to 21 recuse? 22 MR. ELWOOD: I think that the -- it would 23 depend on a couple of things. First of all, it is a 24 covered relationship, the second cousin would be a 25 covered relationship. And -- and I think the interest
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 there I think would be the subject of some debate 2 whether it is a private interest because it is a broadly 3 shared interest. But I suppose because his property 4 taxes might increase, it would be a private interest. 5 There is still the question of whether a 6 reasonable person under those circumstances would view 7 his -- his judgment, his independence of judgment, as 8 being materially affected. 9 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if I were a public 10 officer I would find it very difficult to figure out 11 whether a reasonable person would think that an effect 12 on my second cousin's property taxes would require - 13 would materially affect my judgment. But it's even 14 worse than that because of the "substantially similar." 15 So the public officer not only has to think about second 16 cousins; the person has to think about everybody who is 17 like a second cousin to him or her. I have no idea how 18 you -- how you go about that. 19 MR. ELWOOD: Well, the way that that has 20 been defined, and this appears -- this is not just a 21 Nevada Commission on Ethics interpretation. This is 22 what the legislature understood it to mean, if you look 23 at the legislative history, when they added the statute 24 in 1999. What they were looking for by adding the 25 "substantially similar" relationships were relationships
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that were substantially similar to household and 2 substantially similar to family. And what is at issue 3 there is not the fact that you have a genetic similarity 4 makes you more likely to see things their way, but that 5 families are presumed to be among your closest 6 relationships. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that you spent 8 your life in the civil rights movement or the right to 9 bear arms movement or one or the other sides of the 10 abortion debate, and these are your acquaintances, this 11 is your -- it's been one of your principal activities, 12 not for pay, but just because of your civic commitment. 13 And then you are elected to the legislature and under 14 this Nevada statute that controls, must you recuse 15 whenever an officer of that association has -- is paid? 16 MR. ELWOOD: No, Your Honor. Because, to 17 begin with, a personal relationship, it only covers the 18 very closest personal relationships. So your most 19 intimate and closest relationships on earth would be 20 covered. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They have coffee together 22 every morning and they're in the same book club. 23 MR. ELWOOD: And even that, Justice Kennedy, 24 applies with extraordinary rareness. The last case that 25 I'm aware of where personal interests alone justified
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 recusal was in 1999 before the statute was amended. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Elwood, for me at least 3 we've -- we've jumped way ahead. I'm not so much 4 concerned about the vagueness as I am about the 5 proposition that ethical rules adopted by legislatures 6 for voting are subject to review by this Court or by any 7 court under the First Amendment. This is the first case 8 I'm aware of that we've ever had which makes such an 9 allegation or -- I'm not even aware of any other case in 10 220 years in Federal courts. 11 And it's certainly not because legislative 12 rules have not been vague. The first Congress adopted a 13 rule that, quote, "No member shall vote on any question 14 in the event of which he is immediately and particularly 15 interested." I don't consider that very precise. And 16 the rules adopted by Thomas Jefferson for the Senate, 17 "Where the private interests of a member are concerned 18 in a bill or question, he is to withdraw." "The private 19 interests," what does that mean? "And where such an 20 interest has appeared, his voice is disallowed, even 21 after a division." 22 Now, that's been around in our Congress 23 forever, but our Constitution provides that -- that the 24 rules of the legislature are to be determined by 25 Congress and not by this Court, and I am sure we would
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 not, we would not review those rules. Now, is there a 2 contradiction between leaving those rules to Congress 3 and the First Amendment? Do you really think that - 4 that the two are set in opposition to each other? 5 MR. ELWOOD: Certainly, Justice Scalia, I 6 would not think so. And this is the first case that I'm 7 aware of, it's the first time anyone has said it to my 8 knowledge. I don't even know of law review articles 9 that said it before basically the decision that is under 10 review for neutral laws of general applicability. 11 But to return to Justice Kennedy's question, 12 what this law - 13 JUSTICE BREYER: You agree with Justice 14 Scalia? 15 MR. ELWOOD: I agree emphatically with 16 Justice Scalia, except that I could never put it as well 17 as he did. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're ending up 19 skirmishing on what seems to me a less significant 20 aspect of this case. This case is enormously important 21 on that major question. I'm not inclined to resolve it 22 on the question, well, you know, this is too vague. I 23 mean, it's even vaguer than what the first Congress 24 adopted. It seems to me that just opens, opens the door 25 to future litigation challenging ethical rules, which -
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 which does not make me happy. 2 MR. ELWOOD: It is true. And in addition to 3 that, to expand it even more, apply it even more 4 broadly, with the exception of essentially the D.C. 5 Circuit's opinion in Clarke v. United States, this is 6 the first opinion I'm aware of where anyone has even 7 held that there is a First Amendment interest in any 8 sort of expressive official act. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You modified your 10 answer to Justice Scalia by saying you're not aware of 11 any case that applied the First Amendment to rules of 12 general -- neutral rules of general applicability, I 13 think. But if the First Amendment doesn't apply, that 14 doesn't matter, does it? You can't limit your -- the 15 type of rules that you say are not -- are okay and are 16 not if the First Amendment doesn't apply at all? 17 MR. ELWOOD: I'm not sure I understand your 18 question, Justice, but I think - 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if the First 20 Amendment doesn't apply to this type of activity, then 21 you would have no First Amendment objection to biased 22 rules of specific applicability. 23 MR. ELWOOD: Oh, absolutely we would, 24 because I think R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul speech that 25 is subject to prescription can't be regulated in a
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 viewpoint-based manner. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 3 position was that this wasn't speech protected by the 4 First Amendment. 5 MR. ELWOOD: But even speech that is not 6 protected by the First Amendment, such as fighting words 7 in R.A.V., can't be regulated in a viewpoint-based 8 manner. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So someone can 10 challenge one of these rules on the grounds that it's 11 not neutral, that it applies in a disproportionate way 12 to particular members of the legislature? 13 MR. ELWOOD: I think they could challenge it 14 in a way -- alleging that it was viewpoint-based if it 15 were only applied to Democrats or Republicans. But I 16 don't think that if it were an otherwise normally 17 applicable rule that it would be subject to challenge on 18 that basis. That is the relevance of neutrality. 19 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm not sure why you should 20 concede even that, Mr. Elwood. If this is just conduct, 21 if this is not proscribable speech of the kind that 22 R.A.V. was talking about, why should we care about the 23 viewpoint based doctrine that's arisen in First 24 Amendment law? 25 MR. ELWOOD: Well, in the event, Justice
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Kagan, that is how I interpret R.A.V., that it would not 2 be an available option to have a viewpoint-based recusal 3 statute that affected things differently depending on 4 viewpoint. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that 6 the rules in the House of Representatives allocating 7 time on the floor or committee membership are neutral? 8 They're biased in favor of whichever party happens to be 9 in the majority. 10 MR. ELWOOD: They are -- I think that 11 they're -- I think that they're neutrally applicable. I 12 don't know that they would -- I am not aware of them 13 applying different amounts of time to majority and 14 minority members. I may be incorrect about that. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and if they did we 16 would review it. 17 MR. ELWOOD: I think that any time you're 18 talking about -- I mean, depending on what the house is, 19 there's an extra measure of deference when you're 20 applying, obviously, to the houses of Congress. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that nice. But the 22 cases come up here anyway, right? 23 MR. ELWOOD: They certainly do come. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Look, fighting words are 25 words. They are speech. There's no doubt that they're
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 speech. And it's a considerable question whether the 2 vote of a legislature is speech for purposes of the 3 first -- is speech at all, not whether it's a fighting 4 speech or something else, whether it's speech. It's a 5 vote. 6 MR. ELWOOD: But in any event, all the Court 7 even needs to get to is whether laws of neutral 8 applicability would be covered, because that's all this 9 statute is. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: This statute doesn't apply 11 just to voting. It says that the public officer shall 12 not vote upon or advocate the passage or failure of the 13 message. 14 MR. ELWOOD: But that is essentially - 15 JUSTICE ALITO: Advocating the passage or 16 failure of the message is surely speech in the ordinary 17 understanding of the concept. 18 MR. ELWOOD: But that is to essentially 19 complete the disqualification just as under Thomas 20 Jefferson's recusal rule. When you were disqualified 21 under Jefferson's rule, you were out of it. You 22 couldn't essentially function as a legislator, and 23 that's all that attempts to do. It hasn't been applied 24 to Mr. Carrigan. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It doesn't apply to
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 outside advocacy? It just applies to advocacy within 2 the limits - 3 MR. ELWOOD: Absolutely. It does not apply 4 to advocacy as a citizen outside the legislature. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But even if you have a law 6 which is not directed to speech and is directed at 7 conduct which is not speech, that law is still - 8 correct me if I'm wrong -- even under intermediate 9 scrutiny, subject to invalidation if it has a chilling 10 effect on -- on speech as an incidental matter, if that 11 chilling effect is more than is necessary to accomplish 12 the purpose of the statute. Isn't that correct? 13 MR. ELWOOD: I -- if it is reviewed -- I 14 mean, it depends on the test you use. We don't think 15 that O'Brien, which is a test that some of the amici 16 have proposed, is an appropriate standard, because even 17 O'Brien is talking about laws that have a much greater 18 effect on expression because, after all, burning a draft 19 card, one of the main reasons you would want to do that 20 is an expressive reason. 21 Whereas these really are laws that have 22 nothing to do with what views people think you are going 23 to be expressing. And we think that a closer analogy 24 are cases like Burdick, where there are laws of neutral 25 applicability that States use to regulate their
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 processes of self-government. And those, unless they 2 have a severe burden on association, have been subject 3 to review for reasonableness under Burdick and Timmons, 4 and that entire line of cases. We think that furnishes 5 a much more appropriate analogy for this case. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: The statute says "or 7 advocate the passage of." So I guess that's speech. 8 MR. ELWOOD: But, Justice Breyer - 9 JUSTICE BREYER: And the -- I mean, the 10 basic question is, again, do you agree with Justice 11 Scalia's question, the import of it; or don't you? 12 MR. ELWOOD: But Justice - 13 JUSTICE BREYER: If it doesn't apply, if 14 voting is not speech, then no matter how outrageous the 15 law or rule, it doesn't fall within the First Amendment; 16 and if it is speech, then you get into some of the 17 questions that were raised, is this too vague or is it 18 not? 19 So which is it? 20 MR. ELWOOD: Justice Breyer, I don't think 21 we have to get as far as the position that Justice Kagan 22 was suggesting, that I think Justice Scalia is 23 suggesting, because we're willing to abide by R.A.V. and 24 require neutrality in the regulations of this. I think 25 the -

ELWOOD: Right. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: -- which is an informed 12 opinion, about how we should write that paragraph. Do 13 we say that voting is within the First Amendment scope 14 or do we say it is not? 15 MR. ELWOOD: I think you would say that it 16 is not, that it is not -- voting - 17 JUSTICE BREYER: In that case, the most 18 outrageous law you can think of - 19 MR. ELWOOD: Right. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- in respect of voting is 21 not covered by the First Amendment? 22 MR.

1 willing to do - 2 MR. ELWOOD: It can be a neutral restriction 3 on voting, which is not itself - 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Elwood, why is that 5 extraordinary? Why aren't you willing to accept that? 6 I mean, if -- if the Speaker of the House counts the 7 votes wrong and he says the ayes have it when it's 8 obvious that the ayes don't have it, do we review that? 9 MR. ELWOOD: I think that that represents - 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any greater 11 violation of the principles of democracy than counting 12 the votes wrong in the legislature? Yet that matter is 13 not reviewable here, is it? 14 MR. ELWOOD: I -- I don't believe that it 15 would be. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: So why is it extraordinary 17 that this one should not be reviewable? 18 MR. ELWOOD: Justice, I just think that 19 there are certain things that you don't -- there's a - 20 there's a sort of principle when you're dealing with 21 other branches of government that you don't look behind 22 it when they certify things. This Court has held that 23 in various contexts. And I don't think -- you know, it 24 may well be that that would support an even -- a 25 stronger rule than we are advocating; but, you know, all
21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 we are here to defend is a neutral law on the part of 2 the State of Nevada. 3 JUSTICE ALITO: In several recent cases the 4 Court has taken pains to make the point that it is not 5 going to recognize any new categories of unprotected 6 speech. But the argument that you seem to be endorsing 7 now in response to some questions is that there is this 8 new category of unprotected speech, which is advocacy of 9 the passage of legislation when a recusal statute comes 10 into play. 11 MR. ELWOOD: But I think that if there's any 12 law that has a better claim to -- to be added to that 13 category, it's one that would be consistent with a law 14 or a rule that was adopted by the first Congress 7 days 15 after they first achieved a quorum. I mean, those were 16 the people who were the people who proposed and framed 17 the First Amendment, and they never indicated that they 18 thought any sort of personal First Amendment right was 19 implicated by recusal rules, either by them or Thomas 20 Jefferson's rule, which was not even a rule adopted by 21 the whole House. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, just to clarify 23 this issue, because I don't know that I've heard you 24 state it explicitly, the second part of this recusal 25 statute that bars the advocacy of a measure in which
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 there's an interest prohibited by the statute, it is 2 your position that's advocacy in the legislative body? 3 MR. ELWOOD: Absolutely. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's only limited to 5 getting up on the floor and talking about that? 6 MR. ELWOOD: That is absolutely correct. We 7 view it as basically completing the disqualification and 8 saying you are just not, you cannot act as a legislature 9 in deciding whether this bill will be passed. 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That person can still go 11 outside and give all the press releases they want? 12 MR. ELWOOD: Absolutely, they can. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do we do with cases 14 like Miller v. Town of Hull and Colson v. Grohman that 15 have recognized retaliation claims because of speeches 16 given during the casting of a vote? Would those cases 17 still be viable if we decide that there is no First 18 Amendment right in voting? 19 MR. ELWOOD: I -- I think they would be 20 viable under the -- the way we are framing it, which is 21 that basically if it's a law of general applicability 22 that you could still bring a claim of retaliation, 23 which -- those kind of claims are problematic for other 24 reasons because there's a lot of what would be called 25 retaliation that is itself protected by the First
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Amendment. 2 But if you're talking about a official who 3 is a civil service employee, assuming you need to even 4 get there because they have their own civil service 5 rights to be there, they would still have the claim that 6 it was based on viewpoint-based discrimination, and 7 under the rule we are proposing -- or the rule that we 8 are willing to abide by, certainly -- R.A.V. v. City of 9 St. Paul would protect those people for a retaliation 10 claim. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Carrigan -- if -- if we 12 did not review any of these ethical rules applicable to 13 a legislature, at least where the rule is adopted by the 14 legislative body itself, as -- as opposed to being 15 imposed upon it by -- by some other body, there is the 16 protection that all of the legislators are subject to 17 it. So if it's vague for Mr. Carrigan in this case, 18 it's vague for everybody else as well. 19 MR. ELWOOD: That is true, Justice Scalia. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: And so it's sort of a 21 self-regulating mechanism. You - 22 MR. ELWOOD: That's true. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: You have to be willing to 24 abide by whatever -- whatever vagueness and whatever 25 ethical rules you -- you have opposed -- imposed on
24

1 somebody else. 2 MR. ELWOOD: That is true, and this law 3 applied -- for the better part of 30 years, it applied 4 to every legislator in the State of Nevada. In July of 5 2009 the State Supreme Court struck it down as applied 6 to members of the legislature. But this was the rule 7 they lived under and they didn't think it was ambiguous, 8 they didn't think that it chilled their associational 9 rights. They seemed to think it was just -- that it was 10 just fine. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose you would 12 have a First Amendment claim under your theory if the 13 generally applicable rule was applied in a 14 discriminatory manner; it turned out, you go back and 15 look and over the last 2 years the only people who have 16 been sanctioned for violating the ethics rules have been 17 members of the minority party. 18 MR. ELWOOD: I think that that is another 19 one of those - 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be a 21 viable First Amendment - 22 MR. ELWOOD: Those sort of discriminatory 23 enforcement claims are whole 'nother ball of wax. And I 24 mean, they're certainly, you know, very hard to prove; 25 and they bring up all those sort of Armstrong issues
25

1 about, you know, presumptive regularity and that people 2 are acting in good faith. 3 I don't know that that would be a First 4 Amendment claim, but perhaps a equal protection claim. 5 But it's certainly not presented here. There's never 6 been any allegation that these laws have been enforced 7 discriminatorily. In fact, arising from the same vote, 8 the Nevada Commission on Ethics sanctioned an opponent 9 of the Lazy 8 Casino because he had an undisclosed 10 interest in -- business interest in the Nugget, which 11 was a political opponent of this. 12 If I could reserve the remainder of my time 13 for rebuttal. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 15 Elwood. 16 Mr. Rosenkranz. 17 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA E. ROSENKRANZ 18 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief 20 Justice, and may it please the Court: 21 The core problem with this statute which the 22 Court has been grappling with is this: an elect -- an 23 unelected commission has arrogated to itself essentially 24 the right to invalidate an election result and to do it 25 in a way that treats core political association as
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 corrupting. If the police of political purity are going 2 to tell an elected official that he cannot cast the vote 3 that he ran on and was elected to cast, they have to do 4 it clearly, they have to do it prospectively, and they 5 have to do it for an important reason. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the 7 legislature adopts a rule that says from now on we're 8 going to require a four-fifths majority for a bill to 9 pass, that lowers the effectiveness of the speech of 10 someone in the minority, and you can challenge that on 11 First Amendment grounds? 12 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I think not, Your Honor, 13 because that is a way of organizing the institution that 14 applies equally to all members of the institution. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: So does this. 16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, this will -- this 17 will single out individuals at any particular moment in 18 time who are specifically isolated and told that 19 that particular individual cannot vote. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is that different 21 from the minority people in the Chief Justice's? It 22 only affects them when they're in the minority? 23 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, yes, Your Honor. And 24 I think - 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it only affects
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 somebody if they fall within the strictures of the 2 statute? 3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And my -- my point is 4 simply that this takes one particular legislator and 5 says, you cannot vote. And those rules are completely 6 fine in certain circumstances, but not when the effect 7 is to tell someone that the rationale, the reason that 8 you are being isolated is because you associated with 9 someone politically who helped you win an election. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rosenkranz, you are 11 not -- is it right that you are not challenging any part 12 of this statute except the one that -- that says 13 "substantially similar"? The rest you have no 14 constitutional objection to; is that right? 15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That is correct, Justice 16 Ginsburg. And more precisely, we are challenging the 17 use of that "substantially similar" provision to expand 18 the statute to -- to relationships that bear no relation 19 to the actual text of the statute. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Rosenkranz, is -- is 21 the vote of a judge in a case like the vote of a 22 legislator? Is -- is that speech? Because judges are 23 subject to ethical rules which -- which prohibit their 24 participating if there would be, quote, "an appearance 25 of impropriety." If there's anything vaguer than that I
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 can't imagine what it might be. Can I get out of all 2 that stuff? 3 (Laughter.) 4 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Here's -- here's what you 5 can get out of, Your Honor. You can get out of -- for 6 example, if you are, in addition to being a judge, a law 7 professor at a State university and that university 8 fires you because of an opinion that you issued, that 9 opinion is speech. That vote has speech aspects to it. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you answering my 11 question? I want to know whether I can get out of this 12 appearance of impropriety stuff. 13 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The answer is no. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? 15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: For two reasons. One is 16 that judges are just plain different from legislators. 17 Judges are supposed to bring no political loyalties at 18 all to them when they are sitting on the bench. 19 Legislators are actually not only allowed to, but 20 expected, to bring political loyalties when they - 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does that have to do 22 with whether the First Amendment applies, with all of 23 its prohibitions against vagueness? 24 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The answer again, Your 25 Honor, is when it comes to judges, we tolerate quite a
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 bit more by way of chill of a judge's vote precisely 2 because judges are supposed to act judicial and purge 3 their vote of all extraneous effects. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's too bad, because I 5 would have been much more attracted to your position. 6 (Laughter.) 7 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I understand, Your 8 Honor. 9 JUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and Mr. Rosenkranz, 10 what about officials in the Executive Branch? When the 11 Secretary of Defense gives a speech and the President 12 doesn't like it and the President fires the Secretary of 13 Defense, does the Secretary of Defense have a First 14 Amendment action? 15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The Secretary of Defense 16 has a First Amendment argument. It would be a very weak 17 one under -- under this Court's opinion in Garcetti. 18 But his First Amendment rights are implicated if it's a 19 speech that he's giving not in the line of his duty. 20 JUSTICE KAGAN: So all the official acts in 21 the legislature, in the Executive Branch, you're somehow 22 saying courts are different, so I guess we don't have to 23 worry about that, but official acts across the 24 government are now subject to First Amendment analysis? 25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Absolutely not, Your Honor,
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and that was this Court's holding in Garcetti. And the 2 reason this Court held that in Garcetti was that there 3 the government is acting as employer. The government is 4 entitled to discipline its own employees like any other 5 employer can. But we all agree government as employer, 6 that Pickering standard, doesn't really work in the 7 context of regulation of political activity. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: What about the rules of 9 civility in the houses of Congress? There are things 10 that a member of the Senate, for example, cannot say 11 about another Senator, or make a personal attack. That 12 would be protected by the First Amendment if the Senator 13 stepped outside the door. Are those -- is there First 14 Amendment protection for that? Do they have -- do those 15 rules have to pass First Amendment scrutiny? 16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Within the chamber, Your 17 Honor, no, if it's just the chamber that's sanctioning 18 someone. And the reason is those are Roberts Rules of 19 Order that apply to everyone and that -- that 20 order the -- the debate. But I - 21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I don't understand 22 that. I mean, this rule applies to everyone, too. It 23 might apply to one person on one vote and to another 24 person on another vote, but everybody at every vote has 25 to look at these ethical rules and decide whether they
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 have to recuse themselves as a result. 2 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And -- and so this is a 3 rule, though -- we have to go back to what its effect is 4 outside of the legislature. This is a rule that takes 5 political associations and treats them as corrupting, 6 core political associations, volunteering of the sort - 7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, do you think that if 8 there were a statute -- let's take out the vagueness 9 aspect of this. If there were a statute that said you 10 can't vote on anything where you have yourself some 11 monetary gain attached to it or if a very close family 12 member or if a close business associate or campaign 13 manager of your campaign, do you think that would be 14 unconstitutional? 15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: It would not be vague, Your 16 Honor. But it would be unconstitutional, unless the 17 State demonstrates why a campaign manager is corrupting. 18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Because the -- the State - 19 what the State thinks is that a campaign manager is just 20 like a business partner. 21 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And -- and the answer to 22 that is no. A volunteer campaign manager is not just 23 like a business partner. There is no pecuniary gain to 24 the -- to the candidate or the legislator as there is in 25 a relationship with a business partner. There's
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 personal political loyalty. That's what the Ethics 2 Commission said was wrong - 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- no -- there's no -- I 4 thought this -- the -- the only reason that we have this 5 case is that the three-time campaign manager was -- did 6 have a financial stake in this vote because the project 7 was approved. 8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, that's not 9 why we're here. That's not why the commission said we 10 are here in the first instance. The commission is now 11 saying we're here because of that, but what the 12 commission said was it's the closeness of this 13 relationship, without regard to the financial gain, 14 which the commission accepted was zero for this 15 particular lobbyist. Regardless of the financial gain, 16 it was the political loyalty. This guy helped you win. 17 Because he helped you win, you will be beholden to him 18 and do him more favors. 19 Well, lots of political activists help a 20 candidate win. But on that - 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it -- it seems to me 22 that if you're going to make this argument -- and this 23 is the point we discussed with Mr. Elwood -- there are 24 two ways to do it. Number one, say this infringes the 25 right to vote, which is a First Amendment right; or you
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 can say that this impinges unduly on necessary rights of 2 association that preceded your election to the 3 legislative post. 4 It seems to me that the latter is the only 5 way that you can make your case and to avoid the force 6 of the argument that the Petitioner makes. 7 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it is certainly 8 correct that the latter is far narrower. This is an 9 outlier statute. No other legislature has ever adopted 10 a statute that says campaign manager or political 11 loyalty is corrupting. And so this Court could very 12 easily say, look, this is just different from all of the 13 other recusal statutes. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't seem to be 15 different from the ones that Mr. Elwood read to us. I 16 think he read probably one from New Jersey and - 17 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, he -- he cited 18 one case from New Jersey. The statute does not refer to 19 political loyalty. And in that case it was a close 20 friendship, and in the course of describing the close 21 friendship the court, after listing multiple factors, 22 said one of them was that they were both part of the 23 same political club. They also vacationed together. 24 That's a completely different application. 25 No State and no commission -- so far as we
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 know from the briefs, there's no case cited where any 2 commission has said this relationship between a 3 volunteer and a candidate is itself so corrupting that 4 we have to disqualify the candidate from casting the 5 vote, the vote that he ran on, that the voters elected 6 him to cast. 7 And if this -- if this is accepted, it 8 places an impossible drag on the associational rights. 9 The candidate will have to think twice before ever 10 hiring or enlisting a volunteer who is a political 11 activist. He will want to recruit the best, the most 12 talented, the most savvy, but he will always have to ask 13 himself: What will this person do 3 years from now that 14 might disqualify me from -- from embarking on my duty 15 that I was elected to engage in? 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's rather exaggerated. 17 I mean, you have to worry he's going to buy a casino 18 or -- or something like that? I mean - 19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. Let me 20 give you a concrete example from real life that happens 21 all the time. If the NRA or NARAL decide that they 22 believe strongly in a piece of legislation and they hire 23 a lobbyist, so there's benefit to the lobbyist from this 24 relationship, and that lobbyist says "I, too, am on 25 mission; I continually lose in the legislature because
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 it hangs in the balance, I'm going to work for 2 candidates who will tip the balance for me, the 3 commission's opinion says that that lobbyist, because 4 he's worked on that campaign and wins, will by that very 5 act invalidate the vote of the legislator. 6 That's just untenable, and there's no way to 7 interpret the -- the opinion that the commission 8 actually wrote to make that anything other than the 9 natural consequence of its -- of its opinion. 10 And worse yet, from the -- from the - 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's what it means, 12 you would think the legislature would change it, 13 wouldn't you? 14 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well - 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it doesn't just 16 hurt Mr. Carrigan. That -- you know, that -- that would 17 be something every legislator would -- would worry about 18 and say, oh, boy, we've got to change this. 19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor - 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: So why don't we let them 21 change it? 22 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. Yet the 23 legislature comes in with an amicus brief to this Court 24 and says that its interpretation of this statute is all 25 it needs to have is a relationship that is analogous or
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 parallel to those -- this is on page 32 of their amicus 2 brief -- analogous or parallel, and they are defending 3 the application of this statute to political loyalty. 4 But let's look at the other side of the 5 equation; that is the -- the Vasquezes of the world, the 6 NRA advocate. On that side of the equation, anyone who 7 deeply holds a view that's political -- let's say it's 8 Mr. Vasquez, he is pro-development. They will refrain 9 from joining campaigns out of fear that when they join 10 the campaign, they will get the candidate disqualified. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: So why -- I mean, what the 12 commission says is Mr. Vasquez has been a close personal 13 friend, confidante, and political advisor throughout the 14 years. So that doesn't sound like any volunteer. It 15 sounds like somebody sitting on a case where his best 16 friend is likely to gain millions of dollars. 17 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That - 18 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what it seems when I 19 read that opinion, that they're thinking all these 20 things combined is what causes this to fall within the 21 category of a reasonable person might have doubts about 22 the independence of judgment. 23 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, they gave a 24 gestalt at the end. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
37

Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. ROSENKRANZ: They lead with 2 "instrumental in the success of all three of Councilman 3 Carrigan's campaigns," and they go through a long 4 narrative about the political relationship. These were 5 not - 6 JUSTICE BREYER: That's part of it. But 7 my -- my basic question is, as you know, with judges, 8 and I guess you have a very vague statute which was 9 quoted to you, and what we have are subsidiary rules 10 with ethics commissioners. I have in my office - 11 they're not commissioners; they're committees of judges. 12 And I have in my office seven volumes which 13 I look at when there's a question, as others do, and 14 those seven volumes contain dozens of opinions of a 15 committee trying to apply vague statutes and vague 16 rules -- not constitutionally vague, but generally. 17 So what's wrong with Nevada doing exactly 18 the same thing here? 19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Because the difference, 20 Your Honor, is judges are a - 21 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, so you're saying that 22 the difference is that we're judges? 23 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: You mean Congress and 25 legislators and Executive Branch people couldn't have
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 exactly the same system? 2 MR. ROSENKRANZ: So - 3 JUSTICE BREYER: And they have general 4 rules? It's called the common law system. 5 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The answer is no, not when 6 it affects associational rights. So let me just 7 distinguish - 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did you argue 9 associational rights below? 10 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Oh absolutely, Your Honor. 11 And the commission - 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why do you think the 13 court didn't address it? Because it relied on the First 14 Amendment analysis? 15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I don't know why the court 16 didn't address it. It was front and center. It was a 17 section -- it was called overbreadth, but for eight 18 pages, from page 9 to page 18, there is extensive 19 discussion that what they meant by overbreadth is this 20 reaches too broad, this reaches relationships that 21 should not be reached. It was not in the cert 22 opposition, but it was front and center before the 23 Nevada Supreme Court. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any catch-all 25 that you would say would pass your constitutional test?
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 You told us that the four specific categories, member of 2 the household, employer, that those are all right 3 because they're specific. But you don't like the 4 "substantially similar." Is there any catch-all that a 5 legislature could adopt that would pass what you - 6 what's constitutional? 7 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- it's hard to imagine 8 one. Let me just point out, no -- it is very, very rare 9 for a legislature to do anything other than what's in A 10 through D. 11 And the problem with this catch-all, which 12 by the way is the term that was used by both the courts 13 below -- the problem with this catch-all is perhaps the 14 words are okay, maybe. I mean, I can imagine someone 15 interpreting those words so narrowly that they're okay. 16 But what this catch-all does is to add language to the 17 original four criteria, so it's not just family members 18 and business associates. It's now friends, close 19 friends. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: You didn't answer my 21 question, which is since the Judiciary uses what's 22 called the common law method, why is it impermissible 23 for the Executive Branch or the Legislative Branch also 24 to use a common law, case-by-case method of elucidating 25 through example what a general -- what a general
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 provision means? 2 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The answer, Your Honor, is 3 the Judiciary does not engage in political activity 4 outside - 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I -- so you're saying 6 that one who engages has to use a -- a definitive 7 rule-based method rather than a common law method? So 8 my question there would be, assuming your difference 9 between the branches is right, still why? 10 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And the answer is that the 11 candidate and the volunteer have to know ex ante whether 12 to engage in this relationship or not. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: But why do they have to know 14 ex ante? There was an advisory process that was set up 15 by the Nevada commission here. 16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And the - 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Carrigan chose not to 18 use it. But he could have gone to the commission, said: 19 What do you think about this relationship? Does it fit 20 or does it not fit? 21 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the advisory 22 process, the problem with it is that it comes too late. 23 The relationship was already in place. If you're -- if 24 the -- if the commission is going to invalidate the 25 result of an election, where everyone is talking about
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 this issue and everyone knows about this relationship, 2 they've got to tell them before they're engaged in the 3 relationship. Mr. Carrigan would have dropped Mr. 4 Vasquez. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, but that - 6 but that's unworkable to say, you know, that every 7 potential -- I think I might run for office next year 8 and so I'm going to get advice from some committee as to 9 who I can associate with? That just is unworkable. 10 MR. ROSENKRANZ: My point exactly, Your 11 Honor. You cannot -- you -- you don't know in advance, 12 because you can't know what's going to come out 3 years 13 later. You can't know what conflicts will arise, and so 14 you don't know in advance. You can't present the 15 question to the -- to the commission. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I've kind 17 of lost the thread of your argument. Is this a 18 vagueness claim or a First Amendment claim? I gather 19 your claim is going to be the same even if the statute 20 clearly said family members, you know, business 21 partners, and political consultants. 22 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Correct, Your Honor; and it 23 is both. There are basically two halves to it. One is, 24 even if statute were perfectly clear, this is a 25 relationship that the State is not allowed to view as
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 toxic, because it is not a toxic relationship in a 2 democratic process; and secondly, this is also vague, so 3 there was no notice up front as to the fact that the 4 commission would later invalidate the result of the 5 election on this basis. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your vagueness 7 argument, is that a First Amendment argument of its own? 8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: It is a baseline vagueness 9 argument on due process grounds, but it gets elevated 10 because of the First Amendment interest. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we can decide 12 your vagueness -- if we agree with you on vagueness, we 13 don't have to determine whether the First Amendment 14 applies in this type of situation? 15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Oh, that is correct, Your 16 Honor, absolutely. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the -- in the Nevada 18 court you argued overbreadth. That was the -- at least 19 how the court understood your challenge, and here 20 overbreadth takes a back seat, and vagueness is the 21 principle on which you rely dominantly. 22 So what accounts for the shift? You were 23 arguing overbreadth before the Nevada Supreme Court. 24 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The answer, Your Honor, is 25 that the Nevada Supreme Court shifted. So before the
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Nevada Supreme Court, everything was on the table. 2 There was vagueness, there was overbreadth, there was 3 extended relationships -- extending to a relationship 4 that's First Amendment-protected. 5 The two key pieces, first was vagueness and 6 then second was this overbreadth argument as I've 7 described it, which really was about the protected 8 relationship. The Nevada Supreme Court called it 9 overbreadth, but if you look carefully at what it 10 actually says, it is vagueness at every step of the way. 11 It is talking about -- this is on pages 14 to 15 on to 12 16 and 17. It is talking about the Constitution 13 demanding a high level of - 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the standard for 15 vagueness that we apply? We apply vagueness to First 16 Amendment prohibitions or restrictions on speech. We 17 apply vagueness to criminal statutes. This isn't a 18 criminal statute. It does have a civil penalty. What 19 is the case that I consult to see what standard of 20 vagueness I apply? 21 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Gentile, Your Honor. 22 Gentile is a case that is about sanctions. It's about 23 sanctions for First Amendment-protected activity. And 24 the standard really is -- I mean, it's articulated the 25 same way in all these circumstances, but it really is,
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 can a reasonably intelligent person know in advance that 2 they are going to be sanctioned for this? 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Here we're talking 4 about penalty for participating. What -- what if it's a 5 disclosure rule saying, you know, you can participate, 6 you can vote, you can advocate, you just have to 7 disclose interest of this sort. 8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I think - 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that problematic 10 under - 11 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Not at all, Your Honor. 12 That's perfectly appropriate. That is in fact what Mr. 13 Carrigan did right at the outset of - 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Well, 15 doesn't that burden his First Amendment rights? 16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: A lot, yes; but a lot less 17 so. And this Court has -- is very comfortable with 18 disclosure when you're talking about public officials as 19 lighter medicine, less severe medicine than an outright 20 ban or a punishment for that association. That's the 21 way it should work in the political process. Everyone 22 in this election was aware of Vasquez's role. It was 23 front page news when the hearing was going on. And so 24 for a commission - 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If the relationship
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 wasn't particularly special, no more special than any 2 other political volunteer, why did that become front 3 page news? 4 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Oh - 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if your client 6 didn't have a suspicion that he was on the edge of a 7 law, why did he bother going to the city attorney to get 8 an opinion? 9 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Because as he testified, 10 and the commission did not disagree, this guy is a Boy 11 Scout, Your Honor. He does everything to avoid any 12 appearance of impropriety. And he said: I did that 13 because I just wanted to make sure; I am not a lawyer. 14 And the city attorney, of course, gave an opinion 15 that gave him a clean bill of health, said: Yes, go 16 forth and do this. 17 Now, if the lawyer doesn't know and the 18 commissioners can't settle on which of these things the 19 relationship is most similar to, and the district court 20 can't choose one, how is it possible for someone in 21 Mr. Carrigan's position to know ex ante - 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How will we ever 23 write -- how will the Congress ever write a law that 24 would be so clear that clients would never have to go to 25 lawyers -

1 (Laughter.) 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- or that lawyers 3 couldn't disagree about? We would have to invalidate 4 virtually every law as vague. 5 MR.

In all the other contexts, the standards are 8 lightened - 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're not -- you're 10 not denying that most laws would be vague - 11 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under that definition? 13 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And there is a - 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That lawyers disagree on 15 the conclusion of what the law means? 16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And -- and there is a big 17 difference between ambiguity of particular words and 18 what the commission did here, which was to say we see 19 these four categories, we are not applying any of these 20 four categories. We're saying -- we're extracting a 21 principle. It's a principle of closeness. 22 Now, close enough for government work when 23 it comes to relationships that are First Amendment 24 protected just isn't good enough when it -- when you're 25 talking about that context.

1 So I did want to talk just for a moment 2 about the degree of burden that we're talking about 3 here, because the commission seems to be saying no big 4 deal, this is just a disqualification provision. It's 5 not actually a burden at all. 6 Now, I think we all agree that if the State 7 of Nevada declared that anyone who is a campaign manager 8 can never lobby the legislature, that would be 9 unconstitutional, and they'll fine them for it, where 10 the strict scrutiny would also apply if the State passed 11 a law fining a candidate for choosing a campaign manager 12 who lobbies the legislature. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm not sure I understand 14 that, Mr. Rosenkranz. There are many laws out there 15 that say people who serve in certain government 16 capacities, when they leave those jobs, can't lobby for 17 a certain number of years. How is that any different? 18 MR. ROSENKRANZ: It would be subject to 19 scrutiny for sure. It would be subject to First 20 Amendment scrutiny. And that would be justified on the 21 ground not of the closeness of relationships that are 22 formed, but on the ground that you don't want 23 legislators here and now as they are sitting in the 24 chamber thinking about generating business with their 25 future clients and changing their votes because of that.

1 That's the justification. 2 But there's no such justification here. The 3 commission has never articulated why political loyalty 4 is so toxic that it needs to be banished from politics. 5 And so, just on the -- on the directness of the burden 6 yet, for a political activist who is engaged in these 7 sorts of relationships, the burden of being told, you've 8 got to choose right at the outset, are you going to 9 represent -- are you going to help this candidate get 10 elected or are you going to lobby? That is worse than a 11 fine, because a political activist wants to do both 12 precisely because they care about the ultimate results. 13 And for the candidate himself who is 14 deciding right upfront which of the universe of players 15 am I going to take as volunteers, they need to know 16 upfront whether this relationship will be viewed as 17 toxic, and if it is, they will not engage in that 18 relationship. 19 This is no less direct than the burden that 20 this Court recognized as unconstitutional in the Davis 21 case, the Millionaire's Amendment Case, or in Burdick, 22 where the only burden was that the paid petitioner would 23 have to register to vote, which is a nominal burden, but 24 those whose consciences were affected by a registration 25 were kept out of the process.

1 If there are no further questions, I 2 respectfully request that the Court affirm the judgment. 3 Thank you. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 5 Mr. Elwood, you have 5 minutes remaining. 6 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. ELWOOD: Now, my colleague argues that 9 the Nevada recusal statute targets political 10 association, and that is simply not the case. Nothing 11 in the statute about politics. Mr. Carrigan was recused 12 because he had a business relationship with Mr. Vasquez. 13 Wholly apart from the personal relationship and the fact 14 that he was his three-time campaign manager, he was also 15 the firm -- the campaign's main outside vendor, and 89 16 percent of the Carrigan campaign expenditures were paid 17 through his advertising firm. That is - 18 JUSTICE BREYER: I think his argument is -19 I don't see -- that the Ethics Commission at least in 20 part relied upon the fact that he was the campaign 21 manager, and he is saying, I think, as I understand it, 22 or at least I have this question, that an ethics 23 commission cannot disqualify a legislator on the ground, 24 even in part, that an individual had a political 25 association with him previously.

1 MR. ELWOOD: I think that - 2 JUSTICE BREYER: It may be a new argument in 3 this Court, I don't know. 4 MR. ELWOOD: I think the fact that this 5 happened to be a political relationship was incidental. 6 If Mr. Carrigan -- Mr. Vasquez does two things, he's a 7 campaign manager, he's a -- he assists in development. 8 If Mr. Carrigan had had exactly the same relationship, 9 but had just been working with him on the development 10 side, it would have been exactly the same situation. If 11 he had helped him with past -- I think the fact that - 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that a new argument in 13 this Court, as I've stated it to you? 14 MR. ELWOOD: I -- I don't believe so. That 15 they've made that argument - 16 JUSTICE BREYER: You made that argument 17 below? 18 MR. ELWOOD: That -- right. What we have 19 here -- I don't know if they use the term that it was 20 incidental. But I mean they -- if you look at the 21 opinion at pages 105 to 106 of the Pet. App, it's clear 22 that they're looking at the business relationship. It's 23 relevant, certainly, to have helped him win three 24 elections, because that's relevant to the closeness of 25 their personal relationship, but -

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think Justice Breyer's 2 question -- he can tell me if I'm wrong -- is whether 3 that argument by them was actually raised below the way 4 he is stating today? 5 MR. ELWOOD: I'm sorry? I -- the argument 6 by the - 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Whether that 8 associational right of the political - 9 MR. ELWOOD: Oh. My understanding, the way 10 I view the briefs is there two references to an 11 associational right in the briefs, and the opening brief 12 before the Supreme Court, I think it's page 918 -- and 13 it was in the context of making a vagueness argument. I 14 looked through it, you can look through it and see what 15 you think, but I did not see that as an argument that 16 this is burdening our associational rights. But I 17 think - 18 JUSTICE ALITO: If they based their decision 19 solely on the -- on the fact that Vasquez had been the 20 campaign manager in the past and he was a great campaign 21 manager, and perhaps Carrigan would like him to be his 22 campaign manager in the future, would there be a problem 23 then? 24 MR. ELWOOD: I think that -- I think 25 probably not, because if the question is whether it -
52

1 it burdens associations so much that it's chilling, and 2 I mean, basically I think that's a -- an empirical 3 question. And because you have to have a particular 4 interest, a private interest in order to be recused, I 5 think that it wouldn't arise so frequently that it would 6 be a problem; but I think more fundamentally here, or at 7 least for purposes of this case, because it comes here 8 at least Respondent says this as an as-applied 9 challenge. 10 What we have here is a relationship that was 11 front page news, because this isn't just some plain 12 vanilla campaign volunteer. This is somebody with whom 13 he has a very intimate business relationship that - 14 that involved this expenditure of $46,000. 15 And I think another thing that is worth 16 noting is that in 10 years on the books this law has 17 never been applied to campaign volunteers. It's -- in 18 order -- campaign volunteers specifically come up in the 19 legislative history of the '99 Act, and they would say 20 would not, without more, be covered, because what this 21 covers is the same types of relationships that every 22 other recusal statute covers -- very close relationships 23 and relationships that give rise to a financial interest 24 in the public official. 25 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose somebody had
53

1 made extensive independent expenditures in support of 2 the -- the public officer's prior campaign, and the 3 public officer may hope that they -- similar 4 expenditures will be made in the future. Would that be 5 a basis? 6 MR. ELWOOD: I don't think it would be a 7 basis under the Nevada law. Because that's a law - 8 JUSTICE ALITO: Why not? 9 MR. ELWOOD: Because it's not a -- it's not 10 a personal relationship, it's not household, it's not 11 relative, it's not employer, and it's not a business 12 relationship. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there a way to get 14 advice as to -- I think you said he went to the county 15 attorney, he could have gone to -- to the ethics 16 commission, and they were told ethics commissions can 17 give advice only after the -- is in office, they don't 18 give -- they are not obliged to give advice to 19 candidates. So when Carrigan is running he apparently 20 has no access to the ethics commission? 21 MR. ELWOOD: I think that that's right. The 22 ethics commission only has authority to give opinions to 23 sitting candidates. 24 If there are no further questions - 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
