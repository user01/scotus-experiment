3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll now hear

4 argument in Lincoln Property v. Roche.

5 Mr. Frederick.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

7 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

8 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief

9 Justice, and may it please the Court:

10 This is a routine diversity case that went

11 seriously awry in the court of appeals. The

12 original defendants in -- named in the complaint,

13 Petitioners State of Wisconsin Investment Board,

14 which I'll refer to as SWIB, and Lincoln Property

15 Company, are completely proper and diverse parties.

16 SWIB owned the apartment complex, and Lincoln

17 managed it through agents. The Fourth Circuit,

18 nonetheless, embarked on a search for affiliates of

19 Lincoln that it thought would be more appropriate

20 party defendants, what the court deemed, quote,

21 "real parties in interest."

22 The Fourth Circuit's holdings are

23 fundamentally flawed, in two respects. First,

24 because the named defendants are proper parties, the

25 court erred in holding that Lincoln had not carried

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 its burden of proof by failing to establish that

2 some non-named putative defendants might possibly

3 destroy complete diversity, and that the remedy for

4 such a possibility was dismissal of the action from

5 Federal court. Second, the court erroneously

6 engrafted a, quote, "very close nexus" requirement

7 onto the test for require -- for determining the

8 citizenship of a limited partnership.

9 Now, with respect to the first issue, a

10 number of black-letter legal principles govern a

11 court's consideration of non-named parties.

12 Let's start with the statutory text. The

13 diversity statute, at section 1332(a), talks about

14 civil actions, and a "civil action" is defined as

15 the naming of a plaintiff and a defendant. A civil

16 action does not encompass those that are not named

17 in the lawsuit. That language is tracked in the

18 removal statute, section 1441(a), which also speaks

19 of civil actions, and in -- mirrored in 1441(b),

20 which says that a defendant may remove, where it is

21 properly joined and served.

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I thought (b)

23 simply enacted a special necessary condition when

24 you had a local defendant. I thought it was not an

25 eligibility provision. I thought it was a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 limitation provision.

2 MR. FREDERICK: It is, Justice Souter, but

3 what -- my argument is that that language, properly

4 joined and served, simply tracks the civil-action

5 requirement under the original diversity statute, as

6 well as the removal provision of 1441(a). But what

7 the court --

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's consistent

9 with it, but I -- it seems to me that it's a bit of

10 a stretch to say that anyone who is properly joined

11 and served, at least in a formal sense, is,

12 therefore, the only person who may be considered in

13 a -- in a diversity inquiry.

14 MR. FREDERICK: What the court of appeals

15 did, and where we think it got off track, was it

16 took the -- to -- the phrase "parties in interest,"

17 and it -- and it took cases from this Court that

18 have used the phrase "real parties in interest" to

19 determine what are proper party plaintiffs, and it

20 used that concept on the defendant's side of the

21 ledger. And none of the cases from this Court talk

22 about "real parties in interest" as being

23 defendants. The explanation given by the court for

24 doing it on the plaintiff's side is to ensure that a

25 defendant is not going to be subjected to multiple

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 suits. But there are many purposes --

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, I take it your

3 answer to Justice Souter is yes. In other words, if

4 the mistake that the court made was relying on

5 1441(b), it was a similar mistake for you, in your

6 opening brief, to put such weight on that language

7 in 1441(b).

8 MR. FREDERICK: Our position, Your Honor,

9 is that the phrase "parties in interest" -- we were

10 seeking to find out where the court could have

11 applied that phraseology on the defendant's side.

12 And the only place that we could find, in the

13 statutes or the rules, was in 1441(b) and the

14 explanation for removal, that we were not a "proper

15 party in interest." And that's why we focused on that.

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, what

17 about cases where a plaintiff sues two defendants --

18 one is diverse, and the other is not diverse -- and

19 there is a motion by the defendants to dismiss for

20 want of diversity? The plaintiff then says, "Oh,

21 but only one of those defendants is the 'real-party

22 whatever,' and I can drop the other one, because the

23 other one is not the 'real party in interest'"?

24 Now, that's a situation where courts, even if this

25 court has never had that problem, have said, "If the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 second defendant, the non-diverse defendant, is a

2 'real party,' you can't get rid of the case that

3 way, but if it's not -- if it's not, you can keep

4 the -- just drop it and keep the case going against

5 the 'real party in interest.'" There are such

6 cases.

7 MR. FREDERICK: There are, Justice

8 Ginsburg. And the analysis goes to whether or not -

9 - how far along in the proceeding the litigation has

10 occurred before the plaintiff makes that choice. Of

11 course, a plaintiff can voluntarily drop defendants,

12 without any consequences, and the courts have fairly

13 uniformly held that it -- that it is no

14 jurisdictional bar for a plaintiff to drop a non-

15 diverse defendant in order to ensure that diversity

16 would be present. Had this complaint been brought

17 in Federal court, there is no doubt that the court

18 would have had original jurisdiction, because, on

19 the face of the complaint, the two named defendants

20 were completely diverse.

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ah, but the plaintiff

22 said, "This is a complicated real estate business,

23 and I want to discover whether there is -- whether

24 the 'true defendant' is a Virginia citizen, as I

25 am." So, on the face of it, it looks like there's

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 complete diversity, but, in fact, the diverse

2 defendant is hiding the "real party." I think

3 that's the position that the plaintiff was taking.

4 MR. FREDERICK: And that position is

5 incorrect, both as a factual matter and as a legal

6 matter. As a factual matter, Lincoln is a

7 completely proper party. Its name is on the lease.

8 It was the employer of Mr. Roche, who was one of

9 the plaintiffs in the suit. It issued the mold

10 policies that are at issue in the case. All of its

11 advertising is alleged to have been fraudulent in

12 the original complaint. And it was the director and

13 manager of the agents whose acts were alleged to

14 have been negligent here. There's --

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The plaintiff --

16 MR. FREDERICK: -- no question --

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the plaintiff points

18 to two offices of the defendant, who's -- the

19 defendant is described by defendant as a Texas

20 corporation -- but there was one witness -- Chaney,

21 was it? -- who said that Lincoln is not a

22 corporation. It is a partnership. No corporate

23 board.

24 MR. FREDERICK: Well, Mr. Chaney's

25 testimony has to be viewed in contact -- in context,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Justice Ginsburg. He was not called as a 30(b)(6)

2 witness as a corporate -- for a corporate form and

3 structure. The testimony that was being elicited

4 was to see whether Lincoln had other entities and

5 ownership of properties in Virginia so that they

6 could attempt to prove that there was a problem that

7 the parent company, Lincoln Property Company, knew

8 about. There was a high degree of imprecision in

9 the deposition questions, and it's fairly clear, I

10 think, that the lawyer and the witness did not

11 understand what each other were talking about. Yet

12 in the discovery process, not a single question was

13 presented that would get at the organizational

14 structure of Lincoln. There was not any attempt to

15 get behind the management documents between SWIB and

16 Lincoln Property. It was one very small snippet of

17 a deposition which has been taken out of context

18 and, we would submit, blown out of proportion by the

19 Respondents in their submissions in this case.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they thought they

21 got closer with a witness named Franzen, who was a

22 Virginia resident, and who also described Lincoln as

23 a partnership, and himself as a partner.

24 MR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Ginsburg, as

25 the Real Estate Roundtable brief demonstrates, and

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 is unrebutted, the real-estate industry operates

2 through many very complicated structures for

3 perfectly legitimate finance and tax-related

4 reasons. And Mr. Franzen is a partner in some

5 deals, but the testimony that was provided in a

6 declaration -- and it is appended to our reply brief

7 -- demonstrates that Mr. Franzen was not a partner

8 in any deal that had anything to do with the

9 Westfield Village Apartments.

10 But what the court of appeals did was, it

11 erected a burden of proof that said that the

12 defendant has to prove a negative, that there is not

13 some affiliate corporation out there that is a

14 citizen of the Commonwealth that would be existing

15 to destroy diversity. And that type of burden, to

16 prove a negative, has never been authorized in this

17 Court's cases. Rather, what this Court's cases have

18 held is that, as the masters of their complaint,

19 plaintiffs have an opportunity to plead whichever

20 defendants they want to try to prove their

21 allegations against. If they want to try to prove

22 Federal claims, this Court has held that that kind

23 of case can be removed. If it wants to plead around

24 Federal claims, this Court's cases have said that

25 that would be respected, as well.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Frederick,

2 earlier you made the point that Lincoln was a proper

3 "real party in interest." I take it that's not

4 critical to your position. Your argument would be

5 the same if they weren't a real party in interest,

6 wouldn't it?

7 MR. FREDERICK: Well, we don't think,

8 Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, that the "real party

9 in interest" analysis even applies on the

10 defendant's side, but it is -- it would not apply

11 to this extent. It's not for the courts, once they

12 have a proper defendant, to be searching outside the

13 record for possible jurisdictional spoilers once

14 jurisdiction has been established. And this court's

15 cases --

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if they -- if

17 they don't have a proper defendant, they should do

18 that?

19 MR. FREDERICK: If they do -- if there is

20 no proper defendant, then I think --

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I presume, then --

22 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. It --

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that the

24 plaintiff loses, not that you get to have the court

25 find the proper defendant for the plaintiff.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. It would

2 be a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, where there is no

3 defendant who would be liable to the plaintiff.

4 But what the court of appeals did here

5 was, it imposed an obligation on the defendants

6 that, in effect, confuses the obligations that are

7 in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19, which looks

8 at whether there are necessary or indispensable

9 parties. And what the court did was, in effect, to

10 take an unnamed affiliated entity to Lincoln and

11 treat it as the --

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick --

13 MR. FREDERICK: -- functional equivalent

14 of an --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- will you just clarify

16 one thing for me? Did the defendant ever take the

17 position in this litigation, in discovery or

18 anywhere along the line, that they sued their own

19 defendant?

20 MR. FREDERICK: No. In fact, in their

21 answer, Justice Stevens, they admitted that they

22 were the manager of the apartment, that they had run

23 it through their agents. They acknowledged that it

24 was their policies that were in effect. There

25 wouldn't have been a basis that would have survived

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 rule 11 that would have given Lincoln Property

2 Company a basis on which not to defend the lawsuit.

3 And so, to that extent, we think it's quite clear

4 that they are a proper party defendant.

5 We've always taken the position that if we

6 are found liable, we would pay a judgment. The

7 issue is that we don't think we're liable, because

8 we think that the allegations in the complaint are

9 completely baseless. And that's what the district

10 court found when it held, on summary judgment, that

11 there was not a dispute of fact as to the core

12 allegations of the complaint.

13 Returning to the point I was trying to

14 make about rule 19, there is a mechanism for the

15 courts to consider whether there are indispensable

16 parties. And what the court did here was to take a

17 rule 19 kind of inquiry -- Is a non-named defendant

18 really an indispensable party, such that dismissal

19 of the action is warranted? -- and to engraft that

20 onto a jurisdictional inquiry. But the reason why

21 we have the Rules of Civil Procedure is, of course,

22 to follow them. And what the Fourth Circuit did

23 here was, it took that kind of analysis, but it

24 didn't follow the standards that the courts have set

25 out for applying rule 19 properly.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, plaintiff

2 certainly wouldn't want to say there's an

3 indispensable party missing, I take it, because then

4 that would put the plaintiff out of court. The

5 plaintiff is arguing that there's another defendant

6 who should be in here.

7 MR. FREDERICK: And, Justice Ginsburg,

8 they never sought to name or join that other

9 possible defendant. They never brought a joinder

10 motion. They never even conducted discovery as to

11 whether or not there was another possible defendant

12 that might be affiliated. And their theory of

13 liability made it unnecessary, because their theory

14 of liability was that Lincoln Property Company, the

15 parent, is responsible for all the acts of its

16 agents. And had they really wanted to be in Federal

17 court, they could have found plenty of Virginia

18 citizens that they could have sued. They could have

19 sued the plumber, they could have sued the installer

20 of a -- heating and air-conditioning equipment, they

21 could have sued the general contractors. There are

22 a lot of people they could have sued if they were

23 that intent on staying in Federal court. But,

24 instead, they made a tactical choice to sue the

25 deepest pockets. And the deepest pockets happened

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to be out-of-State citizens that have a right under

2 the statutes to remove the case.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And because you

4 represent the removing defendant, it is true, is it

5 not, that the removing defendant has the burden of

6 showing that proper diversity exists?

7 MR. FREDERICK: And we readily satisfied

8 that, both on the face of the complaint, which

9 identified Lincoln Property Company as a Texas

10 corporation, and in the remand notice, which

11 identified its principal place of business as Texas.

12 Even the court of appeals had no problem calling it

13 a "Texas parent," because the corporation documents,

14 which are part of the record, amply demonstrated

15 that Lincoln Property Company is, in fact, a Texas

16 corporation and satisfies those requisites under the

17 diversity jurisdiction provision.

18 The -- instead, what the Fourth Circuit

19 has done is to erect a standardless forum that will

20 increase litigation over jurisdiction by inviting

21 courts to make inquiry about parties and entities

22 that are not named in the lawsuit, solely for the

23 purpose of determining whether or not there are

24 jurisdictional spoilers.

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- I know you

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 contend that's not the case, but let's say there is

2 a in-State subsidiary that's completely responsible

3 for all the challenged actions, and the in-State

4 plaintiff sues an -- only the out-of-State parent.

5 What happens in that case?

6 MR. FREDERICK: Well, what the ninth

7 circuit, in a -- in an opinion by then-Judge Kennedy

8 that we have cited, called Simpson -- said you

9 respect the plaintiff's allegations. If the

10 plaintiff wants to sue the parent, and the parent is

11 an out-of-State corporation, the plaintiff is the

12 master of the complaint. And, in the Simpson case,

13 the Ninth Circuit held that it was completely proper

14 to remain in Federal court, even though it was

15 obvious to all that there was a subsidiary that was

16 an in-State subsidiary that, if it had been sued,

17 would be non-diverse. So, we think that's the

18 proper answer, Mr. Chief Justice.

19 Now, if I could turn to the second issue

20 that we have prevented -- presented, that concerns

21 how one would treat EQR, which is the management

22 agent of Lincoln Property Company. We read the

23 Fourth Circuit's opinion as engrafting onto this

24 Court's test in the Carden case an additional

25 requirement that, in addition to the citizens of --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, would

2 you clarify one thing for me? I don't know how we

3 even get to the second question, about partnership.

4 If you're right that Lincoln is a corporation --

5 it's a Texas corporation, with its principal place

6 of business in Texas, end of case; it's the only

7 named defendant -- so, how do we get to something

8 about a partnership?

9 MR. FREDERICK: If you agree with us on

10 question one, Justice Ginsburg, reversal is the

11 appropriate disposition, and the Court need not

12 reach question two.

13 We would submit, however, that, because

14 the error is so egregious and leads to the

15 difficulties that have been outlined by the Real

16 Estate Roundtable for nationwide business entities,

17 that the Court certainly ought to say that this was

18 error, as well, or at least to vacate that part of

19 the judgment, as well. And the reason is, in the

20 Carden case, what the Court held was that the --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I don't

22 understand it. We wouldn't vacate the judgment in

23 part. If we reversed, --

24 MR. FREDERICK: No, but you --

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that's the end of

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it.

2 MR. FREDERICK: -- expressed disapproval

3 with this very-close-nexus standard by which the

4 Fourth Circuit attempted to engraft onto the normal

5 citizenship rules for a limited partnership the

6 notion that its citizenship could be deemed, if its

7 activities had a very close nexus with the State --

8 and I'm referring now to the passage, Justice

9 Ginsburg, that's at pages 16(a) to 17(a) of the

10 petition appendix. There are four page -- four

11 sentences on those two pages that capture the error

12 of the Fourth Circuit. And, just below the bottom,

13 it says -- it says, "The real party in interest owns

14 land and operates a substantial part of its business

15 in Virginia, thus establishing a very close nexus

16 with the Commonwealth."

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but, Mr.

18 Frederick, before that -- you know, read back -- the

19 court -- the Fourth Circuit has said, "It appears

20 that the real and substantial party in interest is

21 this Virginia subsidiary, be it a partnership, be it

22 a corporation."

23 So, it's -- the thing about nexus is not

24 self-standing. The court is positing that there is

25 a Virginia corporation or a Virginia partnership in

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the picture, and then says, "And given that, not

2 only is it -- is it a Virginia entity, but it's got

3 this close nexus because of -- it's operating

4 substantially there, as well."

5 MR. FREDERICK: Well, all of the evidence,

6 Justice Ginsburg, in the record was that EQR was a

7 Delaware limited partnership, where it was

8 registered, composed of a Texas corporation as its

9 general partner, and a limited partner that had two

10 partners that were, themselves, Texas corporations.

11 So, the evidence in the record established that

12 EQR, which was the entity the Fourth Circuit was

13 alluding to here, was, in fact, a Texas citizen, and

14 its attempt to confuse the record by suggesting that

15 there was a way to look at the citizenship of that

16 entity through its, quote, "very close nexus with

17 the State," we submit, is also in error.

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct, though,

19 this entity we're talking about is not a party to

20 the case?

21 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct.

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: So --

23 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, Justice

24 Stevens, and that's where we think that the Fourth

25 Circuit went off.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 I'd just like to make one more point

2 before saving the remainder of my time for rebuttal,

3 and that is that if the Fourth Circuit was correct,

4 SWIB is a critical party here, which the respondents

5 never deny. It is the owner of the apartment

6 building. It is a completely proper defendant for

7 the acts of negligence in -- and other wrongdoings

8 that they allege. But they never mention that party

9 in their brief. So, if the Fourth Circuit is

10 correct that Lincoln, the parent, really is nominal

11 under this Court's decisions, its citizenship should

12 be completely disregarded. That was the holding of

13 this Court in Walden versus Skinner in 1879. On the

14 other hand, if a Lincoln affiliate at that stage in

15 the litigation is a proper defendant, but non-

16 diverse, the Fourth Circuit should have dismissed

17 it, under Horn versus Lockhart, which was decided in

18 1873.

19 If the Court has no further questions,

20 thank you.

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

22 Frederick.

23 Mr. Joseph.

24 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY P. JOSEPH

25 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. JOSEPH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

2 please the Court:

3 The judgment of the Fourth Circuit should

4 be affirmed for two reasons, one of which responds

5 to a question that the Chief Justice asked, and that

6 is that Lincoln Property Company was not a real

7 party to the controversy.

8 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was what?

9 MR. JOSEPH: Was not a real party to the

10 controversy.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why did you name

12 it, in the complaint, as the defendant?

13 MR. JOSEPH: Trial counsel named it,

14 because that was the understanding that he had. It

15 turned out, as Lincoln proved on remand, that it had

16 abandoned the apartment management business in 1991.

17 And that's at page 239 of the joint appendix.

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you'll be left

19 without -- if you've named the wrong defendant,

20 then you have a suit against no defendant. It seems

21 to me you are automatically dismissed. You didn't

22 substitute another defendant.

23 MR. JOSEPH: You're correct, Your Honor,

24 and that's because Lincoln said that it was the

25 manager. Lincoln, in its answer, paragraphs 13,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 paragraph 36, paragraph 5, said that it was the real

2 party in interest, when, in fact, it was not. And

3 that's what's led to the problem that we find

4 ourselves in, because when you have a non-real party

5 to the controversy, jurisdiction is determined by

6 the salient jurisdictional --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: I've never heard of that.

8 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought, if you sue A,

10 and then it turns out A doesn't own the building,

11 well, then you've got to sue B.

12 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, that is --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: And you didn't sue B.

14 MR. JOSEPH: We didn't sue B. We didn't

15 know B existed.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's too bad,

17 that, unfortunately, if you don't know who owns the

18 building, it's going to be hard for you to bring the

19 lawsuit. But we had, I thought, like, pages and

20 pages of discovery rules and -- I've never heard,

21 before, of a lawyer who has a -- you know, in this

22 kind of situation, can't find out who owns a

23 building there. There are records, there are all

24 kinds of things.

25 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, Lincoln

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 represented to the public and to the court that it

2 was, in fact, the manager. Discovery was, in fact,

3 served that would have adduced this information.

4 This issue came up in the reply brief, so it's not

5 addressed in our brief, but if any of your clerks

6 would care to look at the Fourth Circuit's

7 supplemental appendix, it --

8 JUSTICE BREYER: I've looked through the

9 appendix, actually. I read the joint appendix,

10 insofar as the opinion cited it. And it cited, in

11 the opinion, several -- five factors -- and I guess

12 there are no others, though you can bring them out

13 if there were -- that supported you. And the only

14 two that seemed to say that it had something to do -

15 - that seemed to have anything at all to do with

16 suggesting that there was no diversity -- was Mr.

17 Fred Chaney, which said that it was a partnership

18 and not a company. I read that. That didn't seem

19 to me to be what he said. And then somebody called

20 Mr. LeBeau, who said that Franzen is a senior vice

21 president and -- a Virginia resident -- and partner

22 in Lincoln Property. So, I looked up that, and it

23 was on, like, page 273 and, I think, 173 there. And

24 they asked Mr. LeBeau, and he says, "Lincoln

25 operates through many different structures, and I

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 don't know what they were using here." Am I right -

2-

3 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: -- or did I misread it?

5 MR. JOSEPH: -- you read that absolutely

6 correctly. There --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So --

8 MR. JOSEPH: -- are other --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- what is the evidence?

10 MR. JOSEPH: There are -- there is other

11 evidence on that issue, which I believe is a

12 distinct issue, but let me address that issue. In

13 lawyer-prepared documents that were submitted

14 specifically to rule 26(a)(1) disclosures and the --

15 and the supplemental interrogatory answers, which

16 we've cited in our brief, it was lawyers that

17 identified Mr. Franzen as a senior vice president

18 and partner of Lincoln Property Company, raising an

19 issue --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: Where is it in the

21 appendix? It said that he -- you sue person X, and

22 I take it the reason that you won this case in the

23 Fourth Circuit -- which was surprising to me -- was

24 that a person called Mr. Franzen, who is a resident

25 of Virginia, was a partner of the defendant. Now, I

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 would like -- and, indeed, it was a partnership of

2 which he was a partner. So, if a Virginia resident

3 is a partner of the defendant, which is a

4 partnership, then maybe you were right.

5 So, I'm interested in: What is the

6 evidence that Mr. Franzen was a partner of the

7 defendant, which is a partnership?

8 MR. JOSEPH: On page 179 of the joint

9 appendix, Your Honor, in Lincoln's supplemental

10 answers to interrogatories, Mr. Franzen is

11 identified in this affirmation as a senior vice

12 president and partner of Lincoln Property Company.

13 As I said, there are two issues. What is Lincoln's

14 characterization?

15 On the next page, page 181, in the

16 supplemental initial disclosures, Mr. Franzen is

17 again, in the middle of the page, identified as a

18 partner of Lincoln Property Company.

19 JUSTICE BREYER: What page --

20 MR. JOSEPH: I'm sorry, that --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: -- is that? Is that a --

22 MR. JOSEPH: -- that was joint appendix,

23 page 181.

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's better than

25 what is in the opinion. What is it? 181.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. JOSEPH: 181, Your Honor. The prior

2 one was 179. There was --

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how about joint

4 appendix 239 and 275, both of which say that Franzen

5 was not a partner in any entity responsible for

6 managing the apartments in question?

7 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, that evidence was

8 also in the record. The Fourth Circuit was not

9 comfortable that Mr. Franzen was being entirely

10 candid by not identifying which partnerships, in

11 fact, he was involved in. And I would note, Your

12 Honor, that this paragraph does not identify any

13 entity that actually managed the apartment building.

14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Mr. Joseph, I --

15 MR. JOSEPH: Yes, Your Honor.

16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- I thought we had to

17 decide whether an unnamed private party should be

18 considered for jurisdictional purposes.

19 MR. JOSEPH: Correct.

20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And do you have any

21 case supporting that proposition?

22 MR. JOSEPH: Yes, Your Honor. I'd cite

23 two cases, in particular, for a real-party-to-the-

24 controversy defendant, where his citizenship is

25 disregarded, even though he's named: Barney versus

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 City of Baltimore, 73 U.S. 580, and Little against

2 Giles, 118 U.S. 596.

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- it sounds to

4 me -- if I understood your answer correctly, you're

5 talking about cases in which the named party

6 citizenship is disregarded.

7 MR. JOSEPH: Correct, Your Honor.

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Where the question is,

9 Should an unnamed party citizenship "be" regarded?

10 MR. JOSEPH: Absolutely, Your Honor. And

11 that is the issue that we find in the Fourth

12 Circuit. The Fourth Circuit found that Lincoln

13 Property Company was a nominal defendant.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then there's no

15 defendant.

16 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, they defended the

17 case. And we'd submit that, on the basis of Barney

18 and Little, that what one does -- on the basis of

19 the State Highway Commission case, when you have

20 someone who is serving as a surrogate for another,

21 you look to the jurisdictional characteristics of

22 the other; otherwise, he can, by coming in to

23 defend, obtain a Federal forum to which he is

24 otherwise not entitled.

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but he didn't come

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in to defend; you pulled him in to defend.

2 MR. JOSEPH: It --

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: And the problem that I

4 have with your position is, I don't know of anything

5 in the record that indicates that he wasn't ready to

6 defend, that he wouldn't have -- or it wasn't ready

7 to defend, that it wouldn't have paid the judgment,

8 that you could have -- could not have gotten, from

9 the party you named, all the relief that you were

10 asking for.

11 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, it was definitely

12 a party to the controversy. We believe that the

13 point of the "real party to the controversy"

14 doctrine is that every party doesn't fall in that

15 category, and that is what the focus --

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But so far as the

17 Fourth Circuit -- tell me if I'm wrong here -- it

18 sounds to me that the Fourth Circuit took the

19 following position, that for purposes of determining

20 diversity, it is not enough to name a principal who

21 may be liable for the acts of subsidiaries, without

22 naming the subsidiary, or, if you name a -- I'm

23 mixing up principal and corporation --

24 MR. JOSEPH: Understood.

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- principal and --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 corporate parent and subsidiary, or principal and

2 business agent. And I don't know of any rule to the

3 effect that, for diversity purposes, a plaintiff

4 simply cannot choose to sue the parent, or to sue

5 the principal.

6 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, the facts, as

7 you've stated them, I believe, are not the facts in

8 this record.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Where would I be

10 wrong?

11 MR. JOSEPH: And let me explain. It's

12 certainly true that Lincoln identifies, at page 96

13 of the cert petition appendix, a chart of entities

14 that are salient. The most notable omission from

15 the chart is the relationship of any of those

16 entities to Lincoln. There is no evidence as to

17 what -- how attenuated that was or what the

18 relationship is, what indemnities existed, or

19 whether Lincoln actually had an interest in this

20 outcome. They now rely on an agency theory. That

21 isn't how the case was defended.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you named Lincoln

23 as the defendant. And I'm looking at your second

24 amended complaint, which says, "Lincoln," on

25 information and belief, "is a corporation with its

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 headquarters in Dallas, and it is the developer and

2 manager of the property." That's what you alleged

3 in your complaint. You allege that Lincoln was the

4 manager -- Lincoln, whose Texas corporation was the

5 manager of the property in question. Now, would you

6 -- you're saying that that was wrong, and you should

7 have sued somebody else, and the Court should cure

8 that for you? That's -- it's really bizarre.

9 MR. JOSEPH: Well, let me try to make it

10 less bizarre, Your Honor. What we're saying is, for

11 example, if I had a dispute with John Smith, the

12 son, who's not diverse, but I accidentally sue John

13 Smith, the father, who is diverse, and he comes in -

14 - he removes, and he comes in to defend, on the

15 merits, that he is not a real party to that

16 controversy, and that his citizenship, under the

17 opinions of this Court, would be measured by that of

18 the son to determine whether or not a Federal forum

19 is appropriate --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: He's a real party if you

21 sued him.

22 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just because you're going

24 to lose doesn't mean that he's not a real party.

25 MR. JOSEPH: It's one thing --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me anybody

2 you sue is a real party.

3 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, that cannot be

4 the case, or the "real party to the controversy"

5 case means that every defendant is a real party.

6 And it's true, in this sense, that --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they -- let me stop

8 you on that "real party," because, as has been

9 pointed out, the "real party in interest" concept,

10 as a procedural matter, comes out of rule 17, and

11 it's talking about plaintiffs, that suits have to be

12 brought in the name of the real party so that the

13 defendant isn't in a situation where he's sued one

14 day by plaintiff A, and is not home free when

15 plaintiff B comes in with the identical complaint.

16 So, it was originally designed with, Who is the

17 proper party, the assignee or the assignor? That's

18 what real party -- that's what the concept is

19 familiarly about. Who is the proper plaintiff, not

20 defendant?

21 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, it's certainly

22 true that rule 17 only deals with plaintiffs. But

23 in the cases we've cited, including two I just cited

24 today, it applies to defendants, as well, because

25 rule 17 doesn't confine the limits. In Navarro, the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Court said that it articulates the same principles,

2 but it's not completely congruent with the "real

3 party to the controversy" test.

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Rule 17 is about

5 joinder of parties; it's not about jurisdiction.

6 MR. JOSEPH: Exactly right. And we're

7 talking about the jurisdiction of the court under

8 the "real party to the controversy" test.

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, that's -- it's

10 something different. It's a -- it's a whole other

11 animal, because "real party in interest," as used in

12 the Federal rules, is a device -- is a joinder

13 device, is in the joinder rules. Now you're saying,

14 "Ah, but there's some other real-party concept out

15 there that has to do with jurisdiction."

16 MR. JOSEPH: Yes, Your Honor. And I

17 believe the Court's opinion, in Carden, identified

18 "real party to the controversy" doctrine in a recent

19 example. I believe it was mentioned again in the

20 Grupo Dataflux opinion. The concept is that the

21 real parties to the controversy must be before the

22 court.

23 And to respond to Justice Scalia's --

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Carden was

25 about: In a partnership, does every partner's

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 citizenship count?

2 MR. JOSEPH: Correct. And in -- it

3 identified --

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There wasn't any

5 question that -- that it was the right or the --

6 that the defendant was a wrong defendant or that --

7 MR. JOSEPH: The language I'm referring

8 to, in Carden, was in distinguishing the dissenting

9 opinion, in saying that if, in fact, the question

10 were, Which of the parties before the court should

11 be considered, for jurisdictional purposes? it would

12 be the real parties to the controversy.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: But to get the real

14 parties before the court, you have to sue them.

15 MR. JOSEPH: That's correct.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: And, apparently, you

17 didn't sue the right people until you replied to me.

18 Then I took your argument, because it seemed like

19 seven arguments, mixed up, and I took that argument

20 to be the following. I'm -- I, the plaintiff, sued

21 a defendant, who is called the Lincoln Property

22 Company. Now, I grant you, there is some evidence

23 that that defendant, the one I sued, is a Texas

24 corporation. One, they showed us the certificate of

25 incorporation, or they got a sworn statement. Two,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in my complaint, I said that's what he was.

2 However, there is some evidence the other

3 way. On page 179 and 181, we have a person named

4 Mr. Franzen who says, "I am the senior president, vice

5 president, partner for defendant Lincoln Property

6 Company," in which case, if that's your argument,

7 you're telling us -- is that your argument, that

8 there is some evidence the real defendant, whom I

9 sued, is not a corporation, despite the apparent

10 evidence to the contrary?

11 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: Rather, it is a partner,

13 and Mr. Franzen is a partner in it. Is that your

14 argument?

15 MR. JOSEPH: We did argue, and we do

16 argue, that the Fourth Circuit could reasonably

17 conclude, on burden-of-proof grounds, that it was

18 not satisfied that the Texas corporation was a

19 corporate entity. But the argument that I've been

20 using --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to make that

22 argument here, or are you going to give up on that

23 argument?

24 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, we're not

25 abandoning the argument, only because if you look at

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the corporate entity, itself, from the joint

2 appendix, 243, it began as Lincoln Property number

3 one. If we then look at the yellow brief, in the

4 addendum, we have thousands of Lincoln entities. We

5 have no doubt there is a corporation that is a Texas

6 entity.

7 Now, our argument today is that that

8 entity could not step in the shoes of another

9 potentially non-diverse entity without at least

10 identifying who the -- what the jurisdictional

11 characteristics of that entity were. Agency was not

12 argued. Agency was not argued below. Lincoln said

13 it was the manager. The district court found, in

14 three opinions, Lincoln was the manager. The

15 plaintiffs thought they were suing the entity

16 managing the premises. Lincoln was not that entity.

17 It had abandoned that business.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if they said they

19 were, then it seems to me -- why don't you just hold

20 them to it?

21 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, it was not the

22 plaintiff's choice.

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it seems very odd

24 that they -- they say, "We were," and you say, "Oh,

25 no, you weren't."

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 [Laughter.]

2 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: "We shouldn't have sued

4 you." Why don't you just take them at their word

5 and sue them?

6 MR. JOSEPH: There were significant

7 tactical advantages to Lincoln, whatever its

8 relationship with these entities, in being in

9 Federal court. The plaintiff preferred a State-

10 court venue where there was no Daubert and there was

11 no summary judgment permissible on the basis of

12 affidavits and deposition testimony.

13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it isn't up to the

14 court of appeals to make some kind of roving inquiry

15 of who would have been a better defendant. It just

16 seems to me the Fourth Circuit rule is totally

17 unworkable and unprecedented. I don't see how you

18 can possibly overcome that, because the plaintiff is

19 the master of its complaint, and it can decide who

20 to sue. And Lincoln was sued as a corporation, and

21 I don't see what business it is of a court to say,

22 "Oh, it should have been somebody else."

23 MR. JOSEPH: Let me attempt to articulate

24 a proposition, Your Honor, and that is that when

25 jurisdiction is challenged, the party asserting

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 jurisdiction, seeking the Federal forum, has to

2 defend it by proving diversity of citizenship, and

3 that means when its "real party to the controversy"

4 status is challenged, it has to adduce sufficient

5 evidence that it is, indeed, the real party to the

6 controversy.

7 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, you can move, as

8 a party to the case, to dismiss somebody who's sued

9 for some reason, but that isn't what happened here.

10 MR. JOSEPH: It is not what happened here.

11 And I would submit to you it is not what happened

12 here, because of a lack of candor on the part of the

13 defendant. Ordinarily, one would expect the

14 defendant to say, "Not me." In fact, this defendant

15 proceeded to litigate --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what if they did?

17 Suppose they did say, "Not me," and you proceeded

18 with your lawsuit.

19 MR. JOSEPH: They'd --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay? What would happen?

21 MR. JOSEPH: Your --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: They would win the

23 judgment. Would they be the real party in that

24 controversy?

25 MR. JOSEPH: And that --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course they would be.

2 Because you sued them. Even if they're innocent --

3 are you saying all innocent parties are not parties

4 to the controversy?

5 MR. JOSEPH: By no means --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think so.

7 MR. JOSEPH: -- Your Honor. And that was

8 -- that was a part of your first question, which I

9 want to respond to. Anybody who is a non-real party

10 to the controversy finds jurisdiction in the Federal

11 court to be able to establish that it is not the

12 party. But when it defends, by standing in the

13 shoes as a surrogate for another in order to obtain

14 a Federal forum, the jurisdictional characteristics

15 of that party are not germane. It is the

16 jurisdictional characteristics of the party in whose

17 shoes it stands.

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we don't know --

19 MR. JOSEPH: That is --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- who that party is.

21 Let's go back to your -- when you started

22 this case, you said that you would, on discovery --

23 this is what you said in -- at the time of your

24 initial complaint -- determine if there is an

25 additional defendant, or defendants, who should be

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 named as parties. What discovery did you pursue to

2 find out if there was an additional defendant, or

3 defendants, who should be named as parties?

4 MR. JOSEPH: Interrogatory number 3 in the

5 Fourth Circuit supplemental appendix, at page 35,

6 inquires about any person, which is defined to

7 include any corporate affiliate, that has any

8 knowledge of the tenancy of the plaintiffs. The

9 objections are not in the record. Again, this

10 issue came up in the yellow brief, but they did not

11 reply to that.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Has any knowledge of --

13 MR. JOSEPH: Documents --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the what of --

15 MR. JOSEPH: Of the tenancy of the --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.

17 MR. JOSEPH: -- lease relationship of the

18 Roches in the Westfield Village Apartment --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Joseph, can I ask

20 you to go back to the beginning for a second?

21 MR. JOSEPH: Yes, sir.

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: They filed a reply

23 brief. There are a lot of disputes about the facts.

24 Do you concede that the Lincoln Property Company

25 that you sued is a Texas corporation?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, we acknowledge

2 there is a Texas corporation. We sued the Texas --

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you acknowledge that

4 the corporation that you sued, Lincoln Property

5 Company, is a Texas corporation?

6 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, we do not, in the

7 sense that we accept the Fourth Circuit's

8 determination that the burden of proof to clarify

9 that entity's status, and the germane entity status

10 --

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understood them to be

12 arguing, in essence, that there's some other entity

13 that really is the real party in interest.

14 MR. JOSEPH: That is correct, Your Honor.

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you dispute, as a

16 matter of fact, that Lincoln Property Company is a

17 Texas corporation?

18 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, what we say is

19 that the Fourth Circuit found that there was

20 insufficient --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm asking you a --

22 MR. JOSEPH: -- proof of that point.

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- very simple "yes" or

24 "no" question.

25 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, we do not -- we

1 do not walk away from the Fourth Circuit's

2 conclusion, so we -- we know there is a Texas

3 corporation. We don't know that that is --

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is this corporation a

5 Texas corporation? The one you sued.

6 MR. JOSEPH: We so alleged, and they said

7 yes. So --

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: So, you say yes, it is.

9 MR. JOSEPH: It is. But whether or not

10 that is the entity, we can't be sure of, because --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'd like the -- these

12 are very expensive, this litigation. You're all the

13 way in the Supreme Court. It's costing people a lot

14 of money. And if there is a legal issue here, I'd

15 like to find out what it is.

16 I have exactly the same question Justice

17 Stevens had, which is where I started. Do you agree

18 that the company you sued, called Lincoln Property,

19 is a Texas corporation, yes or no?

20 MR. JOSEPH: Yes, Your Honor, we'll --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: All right.

22 MR. JOSEPH: -- acknowledge that for this

23 argument.

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Then that's out -- fine,

25 that's out of the case.

1 The next question is -- of course you

2 could sue a real company, called Lincoln Property or

3 Jolly Fisherman, and it could turn out that that

4 real company is a front, that it has no real

5 existence, its -- all its papers and everything to

6 do with it is signed by a totally separate

7 corporation. Are you saying that's what happened

8 here? And if that's what happened here, which is

9 the real corporation and people in interest?

10 MR. JOSEPH: It is -- the burden-of-proof

11 failure that the Fourth Circuit found was that we

12 could not --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not talking about

14 burden-of-proof failure.

15 MR. JOSEPH: We don't --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm asking you, Who is

17 the real corporation or person in interest that

18 Lincoln Property is a kind of sham or front for?

19 MR. JOSEPH: We do not have the answer to

20 that question. And that was the Fourth Circuit's

21 conclusion. We know that EQR is a part of that.

22 And that's why -- they put in an affidavit that said

23 that EQR was the only affiliate of Lincoln involved

24 in the management --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then you think --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. JOSEPH: -- and that's why we --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm getting there. I'm

3 not arguing with you. I'm getting there. Then you

4 think that whoever it is that they are the front for

5 has -- is a Virginia resident. Is that what you

6 think?

7 MR. JOSEPH: What we think, Your Honor, is

8 that they did not prove that that was not the case,

9 and the burden of proof to sustain jurisdiction was

10 theirs.

11 JUSTICE BREYER: Might be a Virginia

12 resident.

13 MR. JOSEPH: Correct. We don't know --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Might be.

15 MR. JOSEPH: -- who it is.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: You think there is a real

17 party there that might be a Virginia resident. And

18 do you have any idea whatsoever of what that real

19 party is called?

20 MR. JOSEPH: We do not, Your Honor.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: And what's the evidence

22 that there is a Virginia resident, in there?

23 MR. JOSEPH: That is the burden-of-proof

24 failure that the Fourth Circuit found. But the Real

25 Estate Roundtable brief, at page 11, identifies the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 fact that it's very common to have a special-purpose

2 entity that is property-specific, which gives

3 further rise to that inference. But it is a failure

4 of a burden of proof that was ultimately found by

5 the Fourth Circuit. And because of the failure of

6 the burden of proof, we're not in a position to

7 identify the party. Had --

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the failure of the

9 burden of proof is apparently a function of the

10 Fourth Circuit's assumption that if you sue the

11 parent, you have a duty to negate the possibility of

12 suing any subsidiary; or if you sue the principal,

13 you have an obligation to negate the possibility of

14 suing any agent. And I don't see where that comes,

15 except out of the sky somewhere.

16 MR. JOSEPH: Justice Souter, I believe, in

17 fairness to the Fourth Circuit, on page 16(a) of the

18 petition appendix, they said that they found Lincoln

19 to be a nominal defendant, not a real party to the

20 controversy. In that case, the relevance of the

21 subsidiary or other entity was to determine the

22 jurisdictional characteristics. And that is the

23 reason why the Fourth Circuit found a failure of the

24 burden of proof, because they could not identify, at

25 the time of that hearing, who was the appropriate

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 subsidiary and what the jurisdictional

2 characteristics were.

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, everything turned on

4 the nominal-party finding.

5 MR. JOSEPH: Yes, Your Honor.

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: On the nominal-party

7 assumption.

8 MR. JOSEPH: Correct. There's no dispute

9 that if Lincoln were a real party to the

10 controversy, they don't have to join every other

11 real party to the controversy.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if the Fourth Circuit

13 is wrong on nominal party, that's the end of the

14 case for your side.

15 MR. JOSEPH: Not quite, Your Honor,

16 because there's still the burden-of-proof issue.

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the burden-of-

18 proof issue, as you've just answered my question,

19 does not arise until the Fourth Circuit finds that

20 Lincoln is a nominal party. And if, in fact, that

21 conclusion is incorrect, then there's no burden-of-

22 proof issue that has -- or no burden of proof that

23 has not been satisfied.

24 MR. JOSEPH: That is correct only if Your

25 Honor makes that determination based on matters that

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 were before the Fourth Circuit. There are a series

2 of affidavits they rely on that were submitted after

3 the Fourth Circuit's determination which may affect

4 the determination as to whether or not Lincoln is a

5 real party to the controversy.

6 Specifically, in the blue brief, in

7 footnote 9, and in the yellow brief, in footnote 15,

8 they've adduced additional evidence. The Fourth

9 Circuit was ruling at a point in time as to what the

10 burden of proof was.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Joseph, do I take

12 it that the essence of your position is that a

13 removing defendant, if that removing party is a

14 corporation, must disclose all affiliates that may

15 have been involved in the -- in the occurrence that

16 the plaintiff might have, but failed, to name as a

17 defendant, that a defendant -- although, on the

18 surface, there's complete diversity, a defendant

19 corporation must, in order to remove, identify all

20 subsidiaries and affiliates who might have been

21 sued, as well?

22 MR. JOSEPH: No, Your Honor, that's not

23 our position. And the reason that's not our

24 position is that, at the time of removal, every

25 defendant that is, on the face of the complaint,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 diverse has the ability to remove in order to defend

2 on the grounds that it is innocent -- the innocence

3 grounds. But if it then steps, instead, to defend

4 the merits on behalf of another in order to invoke a

5 Federal forum -- instead of saying, "Not me," which

6 it could have done, but did not do -- had it said,

7 "Not me," then the plaintiff would have known that

8 it should be looking at other entities. In fact, it

9 said nothing of the sort.

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But defendant never

11 took the position, "Not me."

12 MR. JOSEPH: That is the --

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Defendant said --

14 MR. JOSEPH: -- entire issue.

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- "Yes, we are the

16 responsible party."

17 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, that is correct.

18 And they clearly were a party to the controversy.

19 But if they were not the real party to the

20 controversy, they managed, perhaps, to acquire a

21 Federal forum by virtue of stepping into the shoes

22 of the subsidiaries. And that is the argument, that

23 if they are not the real party to the controversy

24 because they're litigating the merits on behalf of

25 another, it's the jurisdictional characteristics of

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the other that are germane, and that's the burden-

2 of-proof failure.

3 The "real party to the controversy"

4 doctrine is not a new doctrine to this Court. It

5 goes back to at least 1809, Brown against Strode. I

6 mean, the -- it is a fundamental doctrine. And as

7 Justice Ginsburg pointed out, it goes back as far,

8 perhaps, as 1789, to the assignee clause in the

9 Judiciary Act, in section --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I also --

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- pointed out it's --

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question? Did

14 you engage in discovery trying to determine who the

15 real party in interest was?

16 MR. JOSEPH: Trial -- I wasn't trial

17 counsel, Your Honor. Trial counsel did, in the

18 Fourth Circuit supplemental appendix, at pages 35 to

19 38, make inquiries.

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, did he -- did he

21 do a thorough job of trying to find out who the real

22 party in interest --

23 MR. JOSEPH: No, and -- they did not --

24 and I --

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't it be his

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 burden, if he thought it was the wrong person?

2 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, he didn't think

3 it was the wrong person. He was being told it was

4 the right person, and shouldn't be faulted for lack

5 of diligence in accepting the representations that

6 they had the right person.

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah, but if you accept

8 the representation, then they sued the right people.

9 MR. JOSEPH: But, Your Honor, it only

10 turned out at the end that, in fact, that was not

11 correct. And these matters snuck in through

12 discovery, in the course of --

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: It would seem to me --

14 MR. JOSEPH: -- discovery that was a

15 merits discovery.

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- if there was a

17 dispute about this, it ought to -- there ought to

18 have been extensive discovery before you got to the

19 court of appeals.

20 MR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, there was --

21 there were discovery requests served. There was not

22 discovery forthcoming on the issue of affiliates.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you had no -

24 - I mean, you had no real reason to do it. You had

25 somebody there who accepted responsibility, in the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 sense that they were willing to defend on the

2 merits, right?

3 MR. JOSEPH: That's correct, Mr. Chief

4 Justice, which is the reason --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it's only

6 because you lost that you now question whether or

7 not they should have accepted -- you're saying they

8 shouldn't have accepted responsibility, and

9 shouldn't have defended on the merits.

10 MR. JOSEPH: There is no doubt, Your

11 Honor, this is a Hail Mary pass, because the court

12 had made clear what its decision was going to be.

13 But Hail Mary passes connect. And the question is

14 whether or not a real party to the controversy was,

15 in fact, litigating. And we believe that it was

16 not. And that -- we basically come to the argument

17 that limited jurisdiction means the limits must be

18 respected. "Real party to the controversy" doctrine

19 is an established limit. There are federalism

20 issues involved, and we submit that the fourth

21 circuit's judgments should be affirmed, because we

22 did not have the real party to the controversy.

23 Thank you very much, Your Honors.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

25 Joseph.

1 Mr. Frederick, you have nine minutes

2 remaining.

3 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

4 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

5 MR. FREDERICK: I would waive, but for the

6 clarification of two points in the record.

7 Number one, we take umbrage at being

8 accused of a lack of candor in this Court.

9 Paragraph 22 of their complaint says, and I'll

10 quote, "All the defendants, acting through Lincoln

11 and/or their obligations as owners of the property

12 through the lease and acting by and through their

13 agents, were responsible for one or more acts of

14 common law and/or statutory negligent conduct with

15 respect to Roche's apartment, including, but not

16 limited to," a long laundry list.

17 When the parent is sued for the acts of

18 its agents, and the parent comes forward and says,

19 "We will accept the responsibility for our agents,"

20 there's no cause to be accused of a lack of candor

21 simply because there's no effort later to identify

22 who those agents are.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: But I guess what he's

24 saying -- I'm trying to put the -- as good a light

25 on it as I can -- it's a -- that if, in fact -- if a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 big real-estate developer, which is a corporation --

2 what they do is, they organize a lot of deals, and

3 their deals would take the form of hundreds and

4 hundreds of limited partnerships, which are owned

5 buildings in various States. And I think he's

6 saying, "Well, for diversity purposes, we should

7 consider the citizenship of the parent corporation

8 to be the citizenship of the limited partnership

9 that happens to have control of the building that

10 we're complaining about."

11 MR. FREDERICK: And Lincoln had control.

12 It was acting through agents. That's undisputed.

13 But the lease says Lincoln Property Company is the

14 party, as agent, for the owner, SWIB. Lincoln

15 Property Company set the policies for the mold.

16 Lincoln Property Company hired Mr. Roche as an

17 employee. Lincoln Property Company directed the

18 actions of all of the people involved in this. And

19 so, there's not -- there's not any basis on which

20 Lincoln Property could come -- Company could say,

21 "We are not responsible." And when this was --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: No, he thinks --

23 MR. FREDERICK: -- put to us --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: -- you are responsible,

25 but he thinks you ought to have the citizenship of

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the intermediate entities that own, or manage

2 directly, the building.

3 MR. FREDERICK: There would be no

4 authority from this Court to so hold. And there --

5 the interrogatory that he points to, interrogatory

6 number 3, reads as follows, "Identify every person,

7 other than your attorneys, who is aware of the facts

8 and circumstances surrounding Mr. Roche's lease at

9 Westfield Village Apartments and repeat in detail

10 the substance of such person's knowledge."

11 Now, from that interrogatory, we are

12 supposed to infer that there are -- a question about

13 the citizenship of the affiliated entities through

14 which Lincoln is operating. We put forward all of

15 the names of the people that we could identify who

16 had some knowledge about this. But I would submit

17 to you that a response, as he is suggesting here in

18 this Court, is not a reasonable one.

19 Finally, with respect to Mr. Franzen, the

20 fact that his title may say "partner" surely cannot

21 transform the corporation documents that say that

22 Lincoln Property Company is a corporation in the

23 State of Texas.

24 Thank you.

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
