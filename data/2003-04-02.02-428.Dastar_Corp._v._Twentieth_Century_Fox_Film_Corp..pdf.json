  },
  {
    "speaker": "GERBER",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Dastar discovered that an old TV show made by Time Inc. was in the public domain because Fox neglected to renew the copyright. Dastar adapted the public domain show at considerable expense to make it into a war narrative as opposed to Eisenhower's story. Dastar's product did not refer to Time Inc. Dastar's product also did not refer to respondents who had their own competitive video of the same TV show."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Of the same what?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GERBER",
    "speech": "TV show. Because of the latter, that is, the omission of credits to respondents, and the finding that Dastar acted willfully in omitting those credits, the lower court awarded $1.6 million, substantially in excess of the $850,000 total gross of Dastar, in order to deter it. The lower courts departed from the Lanham Act in a very expansionary way in our view in six separate dimensions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Can we go back to your statement? As I -- as I understood it, it wasn't the omission of Fox, but the addition of your people. In other words, it wasn't the failure to give credit to respondents, but it was petitioner's taking credit for it that was what the lower courts thought was wrong."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GERBER",
    "speech": "Taking the lower courts in ascending order, on page 53a of the cert petition, the language is that the court finds that defendant's failure to identify the television series and the book is misleading to the public. And then at the Ninth Circuit level, on page 3a of the petition, the language is that Dastar copied, et cetera, and marketed it without attribution to Fox. Neither court, Justice Ginsburg, examined Dastar's credits, affirmative credits, for accuracy, for whether they registered with the consumers, for misleadingness or falsity in any way. I would suggest that the record indeed is that it was the omission of credits for their competitors that was, in fact, the basis for the double award."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GERBER",
    "speech": "Oh, yes. That's a reference to changing the title of the work. The entire phrase -- and pardon my truncation of it -- on page 3a is that Dastar copied substantially the entire Crusade in Europe series created by Twentieth Century Fox, labeled the resulting product with a different name, and marketed it without attribution. The name Dastar put on it, instead of Crusade in Europe, was World War II Campaigns in Europe. And you will, I believe, see that in neither opinion does either court take a look at the credits on Dastar's product and conclude that they were in any way misleading, nor does the court examine them at all. Our first --"

The judicial interpretations of the Lanham Act, under which this claim was born, were under a prior version that was substantially amended in 1988, and while no court has construed the '88 language, we think that the natural and plain meaning of it is that it encompasses only forward passing off."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GERBER",

    "speech": "Where -- where is that? Let's -- let's look at the statute and talk about it."

    "speech": "And if I may present our most sweeping argument, the language in particular in (a)(1)(A) requires a designation as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of Dastar's goods by another person. So that would naturally cover the situation in which Dastar's goods had the name of another person such as Fox on them, but it would not cover the situation in which Dastar's goods had its own name on them because of the by another person language. When Fox's name is on Dastar's goods -- and that is the normal passing off, forward passing off -- there is a designation that Fox sponsored Dastar's goods or approved it or was the origin of it. But you can --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Now, I mean, that's -- that's one reading of that. I mean, you could say -- and maybe -- maybe it's the more natural reading -- that as to the origin by another person means that some other person originated it. But it could mean as to the origin by another person, if I represent that I originated it, okay, when in fact another person originated it, I would be making a misrepresentation as to the origin by another person because I'm denying that that other person originated it. I'm saying that I did. Wouldn't that be a misrepresentation as to the origin by another person?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GERBER",
    "speech": "I don't think -- the -- the latter principle that Your Honor stated I think would be correct, but I would suggest that it's not illustrated by the example. I think Your Honor is perhaps looking at the as to language here. And in our view what that means is that a representation by Dastar that Fox did sponsor Dastar's work or that Fox did not sponsor Dastar's work would be covered."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

It's one thing to make a representation that the wrongdoer is the originator, with whatever implications that may have, and another to make a misrepresentation which -- which seems down the middle of the alley of the statutory language, that another person, Fox, originated the work."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Gerber, I'd like to go back to what the lower court did because I don't think that you were accurate when you said in the view of the lower court, this was a non-attribution case. I'm looking at page 53, and the court indeed does start out by saying that defendants failed to identify the series, but then there's a semicolon, and it goes on to say --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Excuse me. Where -- where is this? At what page -- what page are we on?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "53 -- 53a of the petition. I'm questioning Mr. Gerber's characterization that this case is simply a non-attribution one because after the semicolon, it says why that was a problem. It's -- it gives the false impression that the series contains only the work of those listed in the credits. So that was the problem that was central for the district court, not simply a non-attribution, but an incorrect attribution. And I don't see how you can ignore that clear statement by the district court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GERBER",
    "speech": "Well, in the district court, if one is talking about the -- the wheat and the chaff, on page 31a in which the district court introduces its lengthy discussion, the statement is that the lawsuit is based on defendant's distribution of a video series, which plaintiffs claim is an infringement of the protected material found in the book, and is an appropriation of the television series, Crusade in Europe, without proper credit. Now, the reason I think that is the correct interpretation of what the district court was doing --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Without proper credit could mean improper credit, but when the court is developing that point in full, it says there are two things. It was the failure to identify. Why was that a violation of the Lanham Act in the court's view? Because it gave the false impression that only those listed --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GERBER",
    "speech": "Yes. I would suggest that without proper credit means what it says. It doesn't mean improper credit. It means that the proper credits were not affixed. And then, of course, when you look at the Ninth Circuit -- Circuit --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It was an improper attribution case, not simply a non-attribution case. I'm simply questioning your original characterization which I do not think pays attention to what the district court, in fact, said."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GERBER",
    "speech": "I understand, Justice Ginsburg, but again I would urge that without proper credit, that phrase, is not a statement that there were improper credits. It's a statement that the proper credits were absent. And I would add that whatever ambiguity may lurk in the district court's findings, it's quite clear that at the Ninth Circuit level, which, of course, is what this Court is reviewing, the case is a non-attribution case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The Ninth Circuit had a rather quick, unpublished opinion --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So it didn't tell us very much. (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GERBER",
    "speech": "If -- if I may turn just for a moment to some of the -- to the question 2, the remedies issue. Here we would urge that the statutory language and legislative intent, to the extent that it is pertinent, coalesce. Subject to the principles of equity, means subject to the principles of equity. This Court, while the Lanham Act was being debated, applied equitable principles in an intellectual property case to define the circumstances under which profits may be disgorged. That's the Sheldon case. And it said equitable disgorgement of profits is permissible only for restitutionary purposes, only to restore to plaintiff something that he has lost. That by definition precludes a purely deterrent award which is not restitutionary in the slightest. If the Court has no further questions, I would like to reserve my remaining time."

  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The petitioner in this case did not make any false designation as to the origin of its good, a videotaped series on World War II, when it put its own label on that good. Petitioner manufactured the good at issue in this case, the video series. It produced it and it and it distributed it to consumers. Under this Court's decisions interpreting the Lanham Act and under the Lanham Act itself, petitioner is, therefore, the origin of the good at issue at this case and is the source of that good in the way that this Court has used that term. In 1990, Congress addressed the question of artistic attribution and it addressed it in the -- in the context of the copyright laws. And it --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Excuse me. Before you go on, suppose -- suppose they hadn't edited the -- the prior Crusade in Europe thing at all. They had not done anything to it, didn't have a -- a new introduction, didn't have the little snippets of addition that they had. However, they did, indeed, make the copies and they -- they made the -- the plastic cassette in which it was inserted and so forth. Would you take the position that -- that they were the origin of that -- of that product and therefore could represent that it was their product?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "We -- we would take that position, Justice Scalia, and I think that -- that would be consistent with the way this Court has consistently interpreted the term origin, if you look at the Wal-Mart case, the Qualitex case, and going back to the concurring decisions in the Two Pesos, which is to refer to the source of production or manufacture."

    "speech": "Do you think that this Dastar product could have been copyrightable as a derivative work on its own?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "We do think that it could be copyrightable as a derivative work to the extent that it's not subject to copyright protection. Of course, the -- the original television series was subject to a copyright, but that copyright expired in 1977 because respondent, Twentieth Century Fox, failed to renew it. And of course, if -- if the respondent had renew it, one suspects that we wouldn't be here today arguing about the -- an expansive interpretation of the Lanham Act. Now, Congress has addressed the -- the question of artistic rights of attribution. It did so in the context of the copyright laws, and it did so very carefully. It limited -- it recognized specific rights of artistic attribution in 1990, but it limited those rights to a small class of visual arts, made them personal to the author of those works, and limited the duration of the life -- limited the duration of the -- the rights to the life of the author. In this case, the Ninth Circuit recognized a general right of artistic attribution that is not limited in time, that applies to a work, an audiovisual work, that Congress specifically exempted from the scope of its 1990 legislation and that is not personal to the author of the work, which in this case was Time Inc. who initially produced the television series."

But suppose in addition the person says I produced this -- this physical object and, moreover, I -- I produced the show that is on this physical object. That is, I'm using produced in the Hollywood sense now. Is there -- is there -- when in fact I didn't. I just did a little bit and most of it was done by Fox."

They wouldn't mind that. But -- but what happened was that on the disk it said I am the artistic producer of this thing. That's what they're complaining about. Now, is there no remedy for that when they weren't?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "Two responses. First, when they labeled a good that they manufactured and produced as their own good, they didn't make any false designation of origin within the meaning of section (a)(1)(A) of the Lanham Act. Now, as we've discussed in our brief, section (a)(1)(B) of the Lanham Act, which the respondents in this case have never invoked and the courts below didn't address, isn't limited to false designations of origin. It applies to false designations that misrepresent the nature or qualities or characteristics of a good. So the second type of description that Your Honor characterized conceivably could fall within the scope of section (a)(1)(B), but of course section (a)(1)(B) was not raised in this case and it's also limited to the context of commercial advertising and protection. The purpose of the Lanham Act and the trademark laws -- and this is made clear in the definition of trademark that appears at 15 U.S.C. 1127, is to ensure that firms identify and distinguish their goods in order to prevent consumer confusion as to the source of goods."

Nothing in the Lanham Act, which is not an artistic credit statute, required the petitioner in this case to provide any attribution to the true creator of the television series that petitioner initially copied."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Or prevented him from -- prevented them from making a misattribution. You have to add that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "Well, we -- we think that -- that's true with respect to authorship because we don't think authorship or -- or the concept of invention is covered by (a)(1)(A). And, of course, the notion of attribution that respondents would urge this Court to adopt this case would have to apply to other types of goods like the sign stand in the TrafFix case. No one in TrafFix suggested that petitioner could go out and reverse engineer and copy the sign stand which had entered the public domain. But that when it did that, it had to go and give credit to Marketing Displays, the firm that initially had the -- the patent on that, or to the original inventor himself, Robert Sarkisian. Now --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Garre, before you finish, there was a reference in your brief that I didn't follow. It cropped up in another brief too, and it had -- it was a reference to the Berne Convention. Could you -- what is the relevance of that international treaty to this -- to this case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "May I answer that question?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Briefly."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GARRE",
    "speech": "It is relevant in that it's an international convention that -- that covers copyrights, but we explain our brief it -- we don't think that it affects the analysis in this case because it -- as -- as the Berne Convention Implementation Act states, it doesn't expand or reduce existing rights under -- under domestic law."

    "speaker": "GARRE",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Ms. Cendali, we'll hear from you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It's still too high. (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "Italians. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is not a case about copying. It's a case about deception. No one is disputing that someone has the right to copy works when they're no longer protected by copyright or patent, but as this Court has long recognized in decisions like Bonita Boats, Sears, and Compco, that doesn't give you the right to create consumer confusion in how you label such works. This, I should correct, is not a case about a work that's actually in the public domain. Since the Ninth Circuit decision, as we've explained in our brief, we retried the work for hire issue. The district court once again affirmed her previous summary judgment decision that the work was work for hire. So the underlying book by General Eisenhower is, in fact, still protected by copyright, though they intend to appeal. In any case, here Dastar violated the Lanham Act by advertising, packaging, titling, and crediting Crusade in Europe in a manner intentionally designed to give the false impression that it was an original product originally created by it. And Dastar knew, moreover, that consumer confusion was likely. Norman Andersen, Dastar's  President, admitted that a consumer would not be happy to have purchased a copy of Campaigns if he or she already had a copy of Crusade."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But the -- the issue is whether the Lanham Act creates a cause of action with respect to that particular unhappiness. What do you respond to the contention that the word origin in this provision simply means who manufactured it, not whose -- whose idea it was? And to put it in -- it applies in a patent context as -- as well. You know these -- these vise grips that you can have a pliers that will hold on automatically until you release it. Suppose the patent has -- has expired on that, and I produce an identical copy of -- of the vise grip and I sell it and I say, you know, manufactured by Scalia. Do I have to say, oh, but it's not my idea? I want you to know that, you know, Mr. Vise Grip is the guy that -- that originally did it. (Laughter.)"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I don't have to say that, do I?"

    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "Absolutely not, Your Honor, and we're not urging that, but --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And what if I say, and moreover it was my original idea? Would there be a cause of action under the Lanham Act?"
  },

    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "Yes, that would -- "

    "speech": "Oh, my. (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "If you hold yourself out falsely as the inventor of a product when you are not, that creates liability under the Lanham Act."
  },

    "speech": "Why? What does -- what does that have to do with -- all right. I don't see it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why is it -- I mean, why is it Lanham Act rather than Copyright Act?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "Well, the Copyright Act just deals with copying, people making copies of something and selling it. The Lanham Act deals with deception, and that's what -- that's what this is. It's not just that they made the copies, but by crediting themselves as the creator of Campaigns in Europe, they were able to jump start their video business and to be able to then get all the good will associated with that product and say, look, we can make these videos --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No. I -- I realize that, but you say, well, the Copyright Act is concerned with copying. It's -- it's concerned basically with -- with copying a certain intellectual content. That's what's -- that's what they're trying to protect."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "That's right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The Lanham Act, I thought, was not trying to protect intellectual content. It doesn't have to. There's another statute there. The Lanham Act, I thought, wanted to make it clear -- wanted producers to make it clear who is at fault if somebody buys the product and doesn't like it. There's no deception here about that, is there? They know they're going to go to Dastar and raise the devil if -- if they don't like it. Isn't that the point of the Lanham Act?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor. For one thing, if they don't like the content and they go to Dastar, they'll have no one to talk to. With regard to the purposes of the Lanham Act, as this Court has made clear in Inwood and in Qualitex --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but they will have somebody to talk to. Dastar will say -- I'm assuming they are honest people, and they will say, well, yes, we did that. You --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "But --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- you don't like the fact that we copied this other stuff and said it was ours? We're the ones to blame."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "But the purposes of the Lanham Act, as this Court has made clear numerous occasions, most -- very recently in Qualitex, is to let consumers be able to know when they're getting a product, if they want to get -- if they like it, they want to get other things from that product -- from that supplier, they can."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Dastar knows who to plagiarize. (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "When -- when I see the Dastar name, I'm getting good stuff. (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "Well -- well, Your Honor, you just don't know whether the next person they plagiarize is going to be as good as Twentieth Century Fox --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's why I'm relying -- yes, but I'm relying on them. (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "They -- they knew who to copy the first time. It seems to me that is just as much a -- a guarantee that they'll know who to copy the next time, as if they had made it themselves."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "Well, the other problem with it, beyond the fact that they are deprived, because you have no idea whether the next time they copy will be as good as the first time, you're also depriving the consumer of the ability to end up buying two of the same product, a very real possibility that they would recognize."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's right, and they -- and they can go to -- and they can go to Dastar and raise the devil. They said, you didn't tell us that you copied that other thing. We'll never buy Dastar again. But they know exactly who to blame."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "They don't know who to blame because if someone buys Campaigns and Crusade, they will not know who cheated them. They will not be able to tell. The products are lodged with the Court. The Court can look at them. If you bought them both, if I bought my dad one for Christmas and another one for him for his birthday, he's not going to be happy to find he has 2 hours of the same -- two copies of the same 7-hour videotape. And in page 205 of the record, it's clear that there are 7 hours of content in that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But the same point. Why can't he sue or you sue Dastar?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "You wouldn't know who to sue. And maybe he also would think --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You sue the person you bought it from."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "But it could have been Fox. He wouldn't have known who was the one telling the truth. Moreover, he also wouldn't know -- maybe he would think, you know what?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, he can sue -- he can sue them both and find out. (Laughter.)"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "I don't know if that's -- that's the -- the best way the law should deal with it. Going back to Justice Scalia's question, though, about origin, there's nothing in the Lanham Act to suggest that Congress wanted to limit the word origin to just the manufacture of a product. Now, in Justice Stevens' concurring opinion in Two Pesos, he specifically noted that the term origin has expanded over time from its original roots as denoting geographic origin, a concept that's now in (a)(1)(B) of the Lanham Act, to encompass origin of both source and manufacture. So just by this Court's own opinion, source is something different from manufacture. What is source? Going back to Justice O'Connor writing for the Court in Feist, in talking about origin, originator, author, the common reading of what --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, but there is -- there is a sort of an ambiguity or at least a debate over what the source is. I think your Traficante -- the -- the sign that stood up well in the wind -- what obligation did the -- did the second manufacturer have to say the idea was somebody else's?"

    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "Absolutely none. They could --"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why not? Why isn't it the same case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "It's not at all the same case. But when you're -- because you're simply selling a physical product -- if all Dastar did here was sell Crusade in Europe as Crusade in Europe, it would be a totally different case. But what they did here is they held themselves out as the maker of it, as the creator of it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but they didn't hold themselves out as the people who took all the pictures. A lot of them were secondhand pictures, you know, taken by news photographers and all sorts of people."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "They held themselves out by putting their names and only their names on the credits, by -- by having a special thanks to the National Archives right before their names, when they admitted they had no contact -- contact with the National Archives with regard to creating these products, by putting only a '95 copyright notice on it, by -- by listing only themselves as producers. The only conclusion one can reach --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I don't -- I don't readily see the difference between that and the sign situation. The sign manufacturer wants everybody to think what a brilliant builder of signs he is. He has a lot of other models in his catalog."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "But the sign manufacturer -- when we deal with products, we don't normally think, when you have a product, that someone is saying I invented this. We're accustomed to lots of people selling similar products. The commercial context is very different."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is what you're -- is what you're saying that when you buy the books or the videotape, you're buying it because you think it's going to be different and you're disappointed when you find out that it isn't. With -- with TrafFix you know if it's a sign that stands in the wind that --"

Why should this?"
  },

And as I say, when you're just simply saying I manufactured the product, you're not misattributing it. If Dastar said, Dastar -- I manufactured and distributed this product, that would not be reverse passing off. They are allowed to credit themselves for what they did.

Now, you -- you don't want to limit it to that. You want to say it also includes what the physical thing contains if it's a -- if it's an intellectual matter. But why do you cut it off at the last copyright owner? I mean, suppose the cassette contained Carmen Jones. Okay? Why -- why -- would I have to identify not only whoever was the author of the derivative work, Carmen Jones, Harry Belafonte -- I don't know who did it.

I thought, in answer to a question I put to you earlier, that you might be suggesting -- you did not come out and say it, but I thought you might be suggesting that there would be a different kind of analysis, depending on whether we were talking about an object like the sign on the two springs, on the one hand, and an object with intellectual content on the other. You said to me -- I -- I said, you know, they -- if they don't like what they get, they will know that Dastar is to blame. And your answer was, no, they won't because they won't know whether Dastar copied or Fox or Fox copied Dastar. And therefore Fox will suffer because there is confusion and Fox will get hurt. And -- and that seems to be a distinction based on the fact that you're buying intellectual content as opposed simply to buying a sign that either stays up or it doesn't stay up. Is -- is that an argument that -- that you would make?"

Dastar comes out with a series that is identical to it and calls it War and simply says at the bottom of -- of the cassette, cassette manufactured by Dastar. Is there a Lanham Act violation then?

That would not have been a problem under the Lanham Act or the -- or the Copyright Act if -- but for the fact that the work is not truly in public domain. If they had want -- they could have also said, new credits created by Dastar. They could have accurately credited themselves for that. They could have chosen not to credit anybody. There's no requirement of credit. Or they could have given credit to everyone. They could have listed the original creditors and they could have -- creators, and they could have added their name on it. All of these things they could have done which would have protected the consumer. The consumer would have known what he or she was getting and also not usurped for themselves unjustly in an unjust enrichment way the good will to which they do not deserve. This is --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "For several reasons, Your Honor. First, the -- what they -- the disgorgement is the normal remedy in cases like this because it's very difficult to establish actual damages of -- of any type. The statute is premised and works this way. You -- you establish your entitlement to profits. In other words, the plaintiff just simply, once they show liability, needs to show what their -- that they are -- what the sales were, and then the burden is on Dastar to come forward and establish what -- what deductions should be from that. Deductions have included the ability to argue apportionment, that only some of the sales should be attributed to the infringement, for example."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, but can I interrupt with -- with -- you got double profits in this case, didn't you?"

  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "Yes, we did. The court had --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And wasn't the theory of that to deter new violations, which I find strange when there's an injunction against new violations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CENDALI",
    "speech": "No, but -- but the issue here is the -- they -- this was undisputed. This was the first of 150 videos. And as Judge Posner in the Louis Vuitton opinion, discussed in our brief, discusses the enhanced damages, and, in fact, damages of any type, are particularly proper in cases such as this where there's a risk of surreptitious infringement. And it's not easy to detect reverse passing off. You could easily have a situation where someone would rather -- a rational, economic actor would rather lose the profits on a particular item if -- if they can get their entire stream of -- of business going forward. This is just such a case because this was their first video. They -- they were able to use this to get instant legitimacy in the video business, and get -- the injury to us isn't just with regard to this product, but the injury for us is the entire future diversion of sales that they've been able to get by suddenly using Twentieth Century Fox's work to march into the video business and get profits time immemorial. That is why Congress has enacted the kind of damages provisions it has under the Lanham Act which I think are singularly suited for just this type of case where it's difficult to show actual damages in any given way. I'll note, though, that the court in our case did specifically find that we did suffer actual damages and they did not appeal from that. The -- the record is -- is clear and they're bound with it, that we lost sales and that we also lost good will. They have not appealed from that. The court did not quantify that in any way, but the court then went on to award us profits and, in her discretion, to award us double profits. She was using her discretion. She could have awarded treble profits, but she chose in the -- in the principles of equity to make a rational decision as befitting the facts of this case. And I -- she also had the opportunity, after a damages trial, to see the demeanor in each of everyone of the witnesses and to assess the credibility of their various statements, and I'm sure she factored that into her analysis as well. And I think that the award should be upheld and we hope that the Court will affirm summary judgment. I note that even though the Ninth Circuit opinion was -- was short, given the fact it was a summary unpublished opinion, my understanding is that this Court has de novo review and has the ability, if it so chooses, to affirm the district court's opinion on any fact in the record. We think that the record amply supports the fact that there was reverse passing off here. It is a cause of action. I'm not aware of any court to ever suggest a reading of the Lanham Act that reads reverse passing off out of the Lanham Act the way that the Solicitor General and Dastar urges here. I'm not aware of a single court to ever make that suggestion. It just doesn't make sense in light of the plain language of the Lanham Act. It doesn't make sense in light of the fact that, as this Court again has recognized in Two Pesos, the '88 amendments were only designed to codify existing law. They weren't entitled -- intended to make any change, and there was absolutely no suggestion anywhere that anyone ever thought that reverse passing off should be eliminated. It's --"

Here Dastar took that right from the consumer. A consumer, if they liked Campaigns in Europe, they may go out --"

And you will see how deceptive they are on the inside and on the outside and how going back to the -- my -- the father getting the -- the Christmas and birthday presents that are identical, which is a very real possibility, that is not a happy situation for the consumer. Congress put in the competitor the -- the private attorney general role to stop it. And I note, moreover, that this was very targeted act -- misconduct on their part. Before they released Campaigns in Europe, they saw in a video catalog that Crusade in Europe in a boxed set was for sale. They didn't care. They targeted the competition and they continued.

Number one, Ms. Cendali contends that there is no textual support in the section of the Lanham Act at issue, 41(a)(1)(A), supporting our and the SG's interpretation of origin and excluding the authorship concept. I would suggest that she's wrong. The textual support is the word origin. Unlike the Copyright Act, which uses the word author, the Patent Act, which uses the word inventor, the Lanham Act uses a different word and the word is origin. And that is completely in accord with this Court's jurisprudence. I think perhaps as Justice Souter had suggested, the -- the purpose from a policy perspective is to render efficient purchasing decisions, as this Court stated in Qualitex."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "GERBER",
    "speech": "The -- the answer under the specific, myopic section we're looking at that it is correct. That would not be assertable. It would be redressable under, arguably, subsection (B) and we may differ from the SG with respect to commercial advertising and promotion and whether a point of sale labeling qualifies. And under a lot of consumer protection statutes in the States as well as the Federal Trade Act, the -- the second point that I promised responds, I believe, to Justice O'Connor. I wanted to add to the answer to the question yes, this would be a copyrightable derivative work, the observation that the copyright defines proper credits for derivative works. It tells owners of derivative works who may be designated as the copyright proprietor, and the law there is that the owner of a derivative work, such as Dastar, may use its name. It doesn't have to refer to the names of owners of preexisting works. So what we have with the suggestion of respondents is a kind of dual series of credits, proper credits under the Copyright Act, and then authorial credits. I -- I would suggest another example in response to Justice Scalia's question, it can become quite burdensome. You know, for a very highly complex, iterative product like a car, you might have 300 pages of credits in the owner's manual before you even get to how do you turn on the key under the alternative universe of credits that is completely different from the derivative work credits required by the Copyright Act. Unless the Court has further questions, then --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GERBER",
    "speech": "I'm not sure I will buy into that consequence. Where both parties state their names as manufacturer, the consumer could be quite happy. He could say Dastar's cost one-fifth of what Fox's did and recommend it to all of his friends. So while there might be confusion in the literal sense, it might actually be salutary. And the efficiency of that type of consumer decision is really what putting the name of the manufacturer on enables the consumer to do. It renders the transactions efficient."
