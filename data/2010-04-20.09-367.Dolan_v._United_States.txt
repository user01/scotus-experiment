1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:11 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument first this morning in Case 09-367, Dolan v. 5 United States. 6 Ms. Karlan. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MS. KARLAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 10 and may it please the Court: 11 The Mandatory Victim Restitution Act makes 12 restitution a mandatory part of a defendant's sentence 13 for certain crimes, and it sets out two paths by which a 14 district court can meet its responsibilities. 15 First, section 3663A(a)(1) authorizes 16 district courts to impose restitution when sentencing a 17 defendant; that is, at the same time that they impose 18 terms of imprisonment, fines, probation, or the like. 19 Second, section 3664(d)(5) of the Act allows final 20 determination of the amount of restitution to occur 21 during a period not to exceed 90 days. 22 Once those periods and the general deadlines 23 for correcting or appealing a sentence have passed, a 24 court's judgment is final, even if it fails to order 25 restitution. In this, the Mandatory Victim Restitution

1 Act is like all other mandatory sentencing provisions, 2 and as this Court confirmed 2 years ago in Greenlaw v. 3 United States, when a court fails to impose a mandatory 4 sentence, that error can be corrected only by following 5 what this Court called the dispositive direction 6 regarding sentencing errors. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Is your 8 argument that if the district court -- for whatever 9 reason, unlikely as it may be -- starts a hearing the 10 day after the rest of the sentence was imposed and has 11 to continue that hearing for 91 days before it can 12 render a judgment -13 MS. KARLAN: No. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that it's now barred 15 from entering that judgment? 16 MS. KARLAN: No. If I understand your 17 question correctly, the district court has imposed 18 sentence on day one announcing imprisonment. Any time 19 during the next 90 days, it has a power to set a date 20 and make final determination of the restitution amount. 21 Once that 90-day period has run -- in this case, on 22 October 28th, because the sentencing occurred on 23 July 30th -- the district court loses the authority to 24 impose restitution. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the sentence is not
4 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 final until then? 2 MS. KARLAN: That's our position. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and what if -- what 4 if the court does set a date for additional sentencing? 5 Then it's not final until then, right? 6 MS. KARLAN: No, Justice Scalia. It would 7 be that once a court has started the sentencing process, 8 it has 90 days within which to complete that process, if 9 it announces at the initial sentencing that it intends 10 to hold open the sentence for final determination of 11 restitution. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I'm not sure I 13 understood your response to my question. It must impose 14 that restitution order, complete all its proceedings 15 within the 90-day period? 16 MS. KARLAN: Yes, that's correct. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it can't hold a 18 hearing over from the 90th day to the 91st day? 19 MS. KARLAN: No, it cannot do that. And if 20 it were to do that in a case where restitution were 21 mandatory, the sentence would become final, the 22 government would file an appeal, and that appeal would 23 certainly succeed, because it's plain error not to have 24 to imposed the restitution. 25 JUSTICE ALITO: Your position is that if the
5 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 court puts off the order of restitution for 90 days, 2 during that period, the defendant cannot take an appeal? 3 MS. KARLAN: If the court has announced at 4 the initial sentencing that it intends to do so, no, then 5 it cannot. 6 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that dramatically 7 contrary to the way criminal appeals have been handled 8 for a long time? There's a very short period of time 9 for a defendant to file a notice of appeal in a criminal 10 case, and you're saying that that is dramatically 11 extended by the possibility of -- of restitution later 12 on or by the fact that the restitution order will be 13 entered later? 14 MS. KARLAN: No, Justice Alito. What I'm 15 saying is that a defendant can only appeal from a final 16 sentence, and until the restitutionary term is imposed 17 within the time period allowed by the MVRA, there is not 18 a final sentence. Then he has from the time that 19 restitution is -20 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, I understand that. But 21 you're saying the defendant is -- the defendant is 22 incarcerated, let's say; is convicted, is sentenced to 23 prison. The defendant wants to take a quick appeal. 24 The defendant thinks he's going to win on appeal. And 25 you're saying, well, no, you have to wait 90 days

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 before you can file your notice of appeal? 2 MS. KARLAN: I believe that's correct, 3 because he has to have a final judgment before he can 4 appeal. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what -- what do you 6 do about the further provision that at any time later, 7 if the government -- or the victim finds additional 8 basis for restitution, so long as after discovering it, 9 within 60 days after that, the victim can come to the 10 court and ask for restitution? What does that do? 11 Does that -12 MS. KARLAN: Well -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, doesn't that 14 necessarily mean that there are indeed two final 15 judgments? That -- that one has to be -- has to go up 16 on its own, doesn't it? 17 MS. KARLAN: That's correct, but section 18 3664(o) of the statute says that the initial restitution 19 amount constitutes a final judgment, even though there 20 can be amendment after it's been entered. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that? 22 MS. KARLAN: In our brief, it's on page -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. Oh -- "a sentence that 24 imposes an order" -25 MS. KARLAN: It's on page --

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- "is a final judgment, 2 notwithstanding the fact that" -3 MS. KARLAN: Yes, petition appendix 60a. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Got you. 5 MS. KARLAN: So that's why that has to be in 6 there, because otherwise the defendant really would be 7 in the position that Justice Alito -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any circuit 9 court who has addressed this issue of when an appeal is 10 timely, in a situation in which a restitution order has 11 not been entered at the initial sentencing? 12 MS. KARLAN: Not in precisely that way. 13 There are a couple of cases that are -- that kind of 14 circle around that. 15 So for example, Kapelushnik, which we cite 16 in our petition for certiorari and in our brief as the 17 wisest way of thinking about this, held that once the 18 90 days has lapsed, the judgment is final by operation 19 of law. 20 There's an opinion by Judge Posner in the 21 Seventh Circuit that's not on restitution but on a 22 related issue, which says that if you have several 23 components to the sentence, until that last component is 24 entered, the time for filing an appeal under F.R.A.P. 4 25 does not begin to run. And that's --

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In this -- when the 2 judge did not enter a date for restitution, did you 3 object to that? 4 MS. KARLAN: We were not required to do so, 5 so we did not. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why not? It 7 seems that that's when the violation occurred. The 8 statute said the court shall set a date if they're not 9 ready to calculate the restitution, and he didn't do 10 that. 11 MS. KARLAN: Well, that's correct, 12 Mr. Chief Justice, but the statute doesn't say when he 13 has to set the date. The statute simply says the date 14 has to be set so that final restitution will occur 15 during the period -- and here I quote again from the 16 statute -- "not to exceed 90 days." So he can set that 17 date once he gets the information from -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought it 19 says -- maybe I am misreading it. It says the court -20 this is at sentencing. When sentencing -- you look at 21 the previous provision -- what is it? 3663A(a)(1) -22 MS. KARLAN: Yes. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- talks about what 24 you do when sentencing it. 25 MS. KARLAN: Right.
9 Alderson Reporting Company

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the statute 2 says, "the court shall set a date for the final 3 determination" ... "not to exceed 90 days." And he didn't. 4 MS. KARLAN: That's correct, he did not set 5 it. But the statute -- I'm now looking at petition 6 appendix 55a, which is where section 3664(d)(5) of the 7 Act is set out. It says, "The court shall set a date 8 for the final determination of the victim's losses, not 9 to exceed 90 days after sentencing." 10 The 90 days modifies the final 11 determination. It doesn't modify the setting of the 12 date. So within that 90-day period, I think 13 that what was -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I think that's 15 right. I -- I agree with you that. 16 MS. KARLAN: Yes. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, the 18 final determination -- the date for the -- the final 19 determination can't exceed 90 days -20 MS. KARLAN: Right. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but that doesn't 22 mean that the provision saying the court shall set a date 23 can wait -- that he can wait 89 days to do that. 24 MS. KARLAN: No, I think it would be very 25 unwise for a district court to do that, but the court
10 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 can't really set the date until it receives the 2 information that it hopes to receive from the probation 3 office or from the victim. So that -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no -5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It can say 90 days. It 6 can say 90 days. 7 MS. KARLAN: It -- it could, yes. Or it 8 could say, as the district court did here, I'm going to 9 hold open the date. But it can only hold open that date 10 until the point at which it actually imposes the 11 restitution, within the 90 days. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a -- this is, in 13 one respect, Ms. Karlan, a technical argument, is it 14 not? Because it's true that this defendant, from the 15 probation officer's report, knew within the 90 days what 16 restitution was going to be recommended. 17 MS. KARLAN: Yes. He knew within the 18 90 days what the government's claim was going to be, but 19 the court did not hold the hearing and did not impose 20 the judgment. And so the August 8th judgment became 21 final by operation of law on October 28th, because that 22 was 90 days after the July 30th sentencing. 23 At that point, the government could have 24 filed an appeal in this case, and, quite frankly, they 25 would have won. As it was --

1 JUSTICE ALITO: How is your position -- how 2 is your position consistent with the thrust of the 3 victims' rights legislation that Congress has enacted in 4 recent years, including the statute that's before us 5 here? 6 Now, in this case, the victim -- the 7 victim's medical bills were paid by the United States. 8 But that isn't always going to be the case, and 9 sometimes victims are going to have a lot of lost 10 income. So you have the victim, like the victim here, 11 who is beaten to a pulp by a defendant and loses a 12 substantial amount of future income as a result, and you 13 say that if the judge makes a mistake, it's just too bad 14 for the victim. The victim gets nothing because the 15 judge waited too long. 16 MS. KARLAN: No, I don't -17 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that's what 18 Congress had in mind? 19 MS. KARLAN: I don't say that, and I don't 20 think that's what Congress had in mind. First, what 21 Congress had in mind was to strike the balance it struck 22 in this statute, which was to give victims the right to 23 receive restitution as part of a criminal sentence, as 24 long as it was done within 90 days of sentencing. 25 Second, the government can appeal if a court
12 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 doesn't follow the rules. 2 Third -3 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, but wasn't -- wasn't 4 the whole thrust of the victims' rights legislation that 5 up to that point, Congress thought prosecutors were not 6 sufficiently attending to the rights and the interests 7 of victims? They were doing their own prosecutorial 8 thing, but they weren't involving victims, making sure 9 they knew about court proceedings, and so forth. 10 And you're saying, well, if the court makes 11 a mistake and the prosecution falls down in its 12 responsibility, the person who suffers is the victim who 13 gets victimized again. 14 MS. KARLAN: No, that's not what I'm saying. 15 What I'm saying is Congress struck a balance. They 16 wanted to give restitution to victims. They also wanted 17 final sentencing for defendants. Congress struck that 18 balance by giving a 90-day extension. It didn't provide -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're not 20 really -- you're not really answering Justice Alito's 21 question. He says he understands that, as I understand 22 the question. We understand that argument. 23 But it doesn't address the fact that the net 24 result of your argument is (a) unfair to the victim and 25 (b) inconsistent with the whole design and thrust of the
13 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Victims Act. 2 MS. KARLAN: It's -3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you, it seems to me, 4 have to say: So be it; the technical rule prevails. 5 That's too bad. 6 I mean, that's your argument, it seems 7 to me. 8 MS. KARLAN: No, my argument is Congress 9 struck that balance, and in some cases, yes, too bad -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the same thing 11 would happen if the trial judge makes a mistake of law 12 which causes the -- the defendant to be acquitted, so 13 that he not only escapes the liability to the victim, he 14 escapes any -- any criminal punishment. It happens all 15 the time. The judge makes a mistake; society pays for 16 it. 17 MS. KARLAN: That's correct, and Congress 18 here has said 90 days. And they meant it. If they had 19 meant to say, at any time, a victim can receive 20 restitution, they would have said that. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: But Congress says -- to 22 paraphrase and not get it accurate -- that the 23 Department of Transportation shall enact a rule 24 governing tire safety within 9 months from the 25 effective date of this legislation. And the Department
14 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of Transportation fails to do that. It doesn't 2 promulgate its law for 18 months. Is that law invalid? 3 The rule? 4 MS. KARLAN: No, generally, under this -5 JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, it isn't. 6 MS. KARLAN: Because that's -7 JUSTICE BREYER: So how is this different? 8 MS. KARLAN: Well, this is a criminal 9 sentencing statute which is different than a civil 10 agency action. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that point. 12 I'm just asking what's a relevant difference? 13 MS. KARLAN: That is the incredibly relevant 14 difference, for the following reason -15 JUSTICE BREYER: Because? 16 MS. KARLAN: -- that finality in sentencing 17 is important, because otherwise a defendant cannot even 18 appeal his conviction. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Why couldn't he? 20 MS. KARLAN: Because he -21 JUSTICE BREYER: You just read us the 22 provision. 23 MS. KARLAN: It's not a final -24 JUSTICE BREYER: The judge enters a -- an 25 order, a final order. And that final judgment, as was
15 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 true here, says: I haven't decided restitution yet. He 2 can appeal. Then what it says is when you get around to 3 the restitution, then enter another judgment, and you'll 4 appeal that, as happens precisely in the case of 5 the 60 days -- you know, that extra stuff that Justice 6 Scalia was referring to. That's a possible 7 interpretation of the Federal Rules of Appellate 8 Procedure. I don't see, you know, the appeals thing. I 9 don't see anything -- I don't have in front of me the 10 language on filing an appeal, but I can't think of 11 anything that's contrary. 12 MS. KARLAN: What's contrary to that is 13 that the Federal courts of appeals only have 14 jurisdiction to decide cases that come up, in criminal 15 cases, on final judgment or under the collateral order. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: That's right. 17 MS. KARLAN: This is not -18 JUSTICE BREYER: It's a final judgment, and 19 because there is another provision that says an order of 20 restitution is itself a final judgment. 21 MS. KARLAN: No. With all respect, 22 Justice Breyer, there is no provision that says an order 23 of restitution -24 JUSTICE BREYER: You read it to us. I mean 25 the one you read to us.
16 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MS. KARLAN: No. That says -2 JUSTICE BREYER: What? 3 MS. KARLAN: -- that a sentence that 4 includes a term of restitution can be a final judgment, 5 even though that 60-day provision to which 6 Justice Scalia pointed is on the books. 7 But you can't have a final judgment in a 8 criminal case that involves several different components 9 of a sentence until those aspects of the sentence have 10 actually been imposed. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why isn't the -12 MS. KARLAN: Justice Scalia, I believe, was 13 referring to the 60-day provision. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, the same problem. 15 MS. KARLAN: The 60-day provision is 16 specifically immunized from the final judgment rule by 17 section 3664(o) of the statute. The 90-day provision is 18 not. So until a defendant -- perhaps I could -- perhaps 19 I could use a slightly different example, which is: 20 Suppose a defendant is supposed to be a sentenced to a 21 fine, a mandatory fine -22 JUTICE BREYER: I see. 23 MS. KARLAN: -- and a mandatory prison sentence. 24 If you sentence him to the mandatory prison sentence and 25 say I still need to calculate the fine -- there is no
17 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 final judgment. He cannot appeal that sentence. 2 JUSTICE ALITO: But isn't there a difference 3 between those two situations? A fine is a criminal 4 penalty. It goes -- it -- the prosecution is brought in 5 the same of the sovereign. The fine goes to the 6 sovereign. It's a traditional criminal penalty. 7 Restitution is not a traditional criminal 8 penalty. It's much like, arguably, attorneys' fees in a 9 civil case. It is -- it is like -- it is really a -- a 10 benefit for the victim. It is not something that inures 11 to the benefit of the sovereign. 12 And so why doesn't it make sense to view 13 that judgment of restitution as a separate judgment, 14 just as the award of an attorney's fees is a separate 15 final appealable order in a civil case? 16 MS. KARLAN: Well, because this judgment of 17 restitution is not a civil judgment. It is part of the 18 defendant's criminal punishment, and, therefore, it is 19 not like attorneys' fees, something that's separate. 20 As we point out in our reply brief, in order 21 to calculate the amount of imprisonment, in order to 22 calculate the fine, the Federal criminal sentencing 23 provisions -- and I should note that section 3664(a) 24 appears in Title 18 in the section under miscellaneous 25 sentencing provisions, not civil provisions. All of
18 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 those things interact. And so you can't calculate one 2 of those without knowing all of them. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, functionally, isn't 4 it a substitute for the remedy that the victim of a 5 crime might have? Wasn't what Congress was trying to do 6 was to spare the victim the necessity of suing the 7 defendant and having his kind of civil restitution 8 tacked onto the criminal proceeding? 9 MS. KARLAN: That's certainly Congress's 10 purpose, but they did it within the context of 11 sentencing. So, for example, Justice Ginsburg, if this 12 really were a civil penalty, defendants would not be 13 entitled to the assistance of counsel in challenging the 14 amount of restitution, because the Sixth Amendment would 15 not apply. The dates for filing an appeal would be 16 different. There would be a jurisdictional bar that 17 doesn't exist in criminal cases. 18 This Court said several times that 19 restitution under these kinds of circumstances -- in 20 Hughey, under the predecessor to this Act, and in Kelly 21 v. Robinson -- is a penal statute. Justice Sotomayor in 22 her opinion for the Second Circuit in Varrone said this 23 is a penal statute. 24 So there is no question here that this is a 25 substitute for a civil remedy or a supplement for a
19 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 civil remedy, but it is a criminal punishment. And 2 Congress has said that you have to order it at 3 sentencing or within 90 days, or else it is error that 4 can be corrected through Rule 35 or by appeal, but not 5 otherwise. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, what -- what can the 7 defendant do within that 90 days? He has to wait 8 90 days before he appeals the sentence that he has been 9 given; is that right? 10 MS. KARLAN: That's correct. There is not a 11 final judgment in his case. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's 3 months that -13 that he has to sit on his hands. 14 MS. KARLAN: That's correct. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that? 16 MS. KARLAN: Well, the final judgment rule 17 says that. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, this is a court-made 19 rule of what counts as a final judgment. 20 MS. KARLAN: Right. And -- and -21 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Is there 22 anything in the decisions of this Court interpreting 23 that rule? I mean, you could have collateral orders. You 24 could have all kinds of things. And doesn't it boil down 25 to the same question?
20 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 I mean, I agree with you that if Congress 2 wanted to make a 90-day deadline, you really have to do 3 it, and you can't restitute thereafter. All right. 4 That's one thing. But if they didn't, why didn't they 5 equally intend the judgment without the restitution 6 order to be a final judgment? 7 MS. KARLAN: Well -8 JUSTICE BREYER: And then later on, just as 9 in (o), if the judge does impose an order of restitution, 10 then of course, that's appealable, and that's a different 11 judgment. Is there -- what in the law prevents the -12 that interpretation? 13 MS. KARLAN: I think two things prevent that 14 interpretation. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 16 MS. KARLAN: One is this Court's precedent, 17 and let me talk about that. And two is a proper reading 18 of section 3664(o). So I'll turn first to the 19 precedent and then to 3664(o). 20 JUSTICE BREYER: So you have precedent. 21 MS. KARLAN: So the precedent is, for 22 example, this Court said in Parr v. United States, which 23 is cited on page 12 of the reply brief, among other 24 places, that "a judgment or decision is final for purpose 25 of appeal only when it terminates the litigation between the
21 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 parties on the merits of the case, and leaves nothing to 2 be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined." 3 Until restitution has been determined, a 4 case does not fit within Parr. Parr is, I believe, an 5 interpretation of 1291, 28 U.S.C. 1291, which is the 6 provision that gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you can -- under 8 your view, you can change the amount of jail time up to 9 the point at which you have to set the restitution. The 10 judge says: I'm going to sentence you to 3 years, and 11 I'm going to figure out the restitution. 12 He looks, and the restitution turns out to 13 be a lot more than he thought. So he says: Well, I'm 14 only going to give you 2 years. Or it's less, and he 15 says: I'm going to give you 4 years. 16 Because the judgment is still open, he can 17 do that? 18 MS. KARLAN: I believe, Your Honor, that he 19 can. And the reason for that is the sentencing statute 20 itself -- 18 U.S.C. section 3553, I believe it is -21 talks about how a court, in sentencing a defendant, is 22 supposed to be considering all of these penalties and 23 how they interact with one another. 24 So if a defendant can make restitution to a 25 victim by, for example, being put on community release
22 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 or probation rather than serving time in prison, a court 2 can take that into account in setting the sentence. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Must take it into account -4 MS. KARLAN: Yes. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you read 3553 the way 6 it's written. 7 MS. KARLAN: Yes, I think they must take it 8 into account. Now, whether -- how they'll actually 9 strike that balance is -10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there no -- is there 11 no possibility that a judge could say: I want to make 12 this analogous to 54(b) under the civil rules; that is, 13 I don't want to delay the time that the defendant can 14 appeal from the -- from the -- from the sentence. So 15 this order is final, and 3 months later, I'll take up 16 the question of restitution when all the information is 17 in. The court is prevented from doing that? 18 MS. KARLAN: I'm unaware of any criminal 19 rules analogue to Rule 54(b) in the civil context, because 20 in general, as I understand the way this Court's 21 precedents have worked, there have been what might look 22 like interlocutory appeals in criminal cases, but they've 23 always involved collateral issues. 24 And the problem here, for the reason that 25 Justice Scalia just pointed to, is restitution and the
23 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 amount of imprisonment are not collateral to one 2 another; that is, they may interact. And a fine 3 certainly isn't, because the statute itself says you 4 can't impose a fine to the extent that it will impair 5 restitution. So if -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the judge -- but the 7 judge could say -- once she thinks she needs -- that 8 they need time for more information: I'm going to 9 defer the whole sentencing. So, Defendant, you'll have to 10 wait 3 months to find out how much time you're going to 11 serve. That would be all right. You could use the 12 90-day period to extend the time for imposing the 13 sentence. 14 Well, in effect, you're saying the sentence 15 isn't final, so she could change it any time within the 16 90 days? 17 MS. KARLAN: There's a slight complication 18 there, but I think the answer to your question is yes; 19 that is, the judge could delay the entire sentencing 20 under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. 21 Look, we're not saying that you couldn't 22 get restitution in a case like this. We're simply 23 saying that you have to follow the rules. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, what about 25 that as a possible answer? If we accept -- the -- the judge,

It seems to me that if 3553, as -- as I said 6 -- maybe you shouldn't have agreed -- requires the 7 sentencing court to consider the totality of the 8 sentence it's imposing, including the restitution, 9 that would mean that the judge cannot impose a sentence 10 before the expiration of the 90 days; that is, has to 11 wait until the restitutionary issue is resolved to 12 impose the incarceration part of the sentence. No? 13 MS. KARLAN: I think the way that the 14 statute is written contemplates that the judge will do 15 the regular sentencing at which he imposes these other 16 terms, but may keep it open for 90 days. 17 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question 18 before you sit down? Are you aware -- maybe you cite 19 them in the briefs and I didn't catch it -- of any cases 20 in which the courts -- a court of appeals has 21 dismissed an appeal because it was taken before the -22 the civil remedy had been imposed? 23 MS.

HEYTENS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 6 and may it please the Court: 7 To begin by addressing the question just 8 raised by Justice Stevens, the government agrees that we 9 are not aware of any cases that directly confront this 10 finality question. There are, however, at least four 11 cases in the courts of appeals where one of two things 12 happened: Either the defendant took an appeal from the 13 original term of his imprisonment, then later took an 14 appeal from the order of restitution and the appeals 15 were consolidated. That happened, among other things, 16 in the Cheal case, which is the First Circuit decision 17 cited in our brief. There are at least two other 18 circuit court cases that do that as well. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was it within the 90 days? 20 MR. HEYTENS: No. It -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: The restitution sentence 22 was after the 90 days? 23 MR. HEYTENS: That's correct, 24 Justice Scalia. Now -25 JUSTICE STEVENS: In those -- in those -- in

I'm not aware of any case that directly 10 confronts this issue. Now -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under your view of 12 things, however, that's fortuity that the underlying 13 conviction was still in the appeal process, because 14 there is no statute of limitations under your reading. 15 A victim could come 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 100 years 16 later and say: I'm entitled to restitution. 17 MR. HEYTENS: The statute -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And absent prejudice to 19 the defendant, that would be okay? 20 MR. HEYTENS: Absent prejudice or some sort 21 of double jeopardy problem, that's correct. The 22 statute, by its terms, says as long as the victim comes 23 forward within 60 days of the discovery of his losses, 24 (d)(5) expressly says that the victim can do that. So I 25 think this --

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, that's 2 60 days after the restitution order has been issued. Am 3 I -4 MR. HEYTENS: I believe that's incorrect, 5 Your Honor. The provision that we're referring to, 6 subsection (d)(5), is reproduced on page 6A of the 7 appendix to the government's brief. It's the, I 8 believe, second sentence of (d)(5) that we're 9 discussing right now that states: "If the victim 10 subsequently discovers further losses, the victim shall 11 have 60 days after the discovery of those losses in 12 which to petition the court for an amended restitution 13 order." 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That 60 days says after 15 there has been an -- a restitution order. I'm positing 16 the situation where the victim comes 10 years later. 17 MR. HEYTENS: That's correct. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That says there's no 19 restitution order. It's the initial action. And 20 you're saying that's okay? It's an endless statute? 21 MR. HEYTENS: It is -- it is certainly not 22 okay, Your Honor. Congress has directed that this 23 determination must be made and that it must be made 24 within 90 days. And Federal district courts are 25 required to comply with that obligation.

And under your proposal, it 11 can be decided by some other judge who is just -- just 12 pulled in, because the -- the trial judge has -- has 13 been deceased. That doesn't seem to me to make any 14 sense at all. 15 MR. HEYTENS: Your Honor, I don't think it 16 is our proposal. Congress has not specified -- Congress 17 has certainly required this to be done within 90 days. 18 That meant Congress wanted it to be done within 90 days. 19 But Congress has not specified a consequence for -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the 21 consequence is the usual consequence when trial courts 22 make errors, which is to appeal. 23 MR. HEYTENS: Your Honor, I think this Court 24 said in Montalvo-Murillo what the consequence is in this 25 category of cases, which is when a trial court fails to

1 comply with a mandatory time limitation for doing 2 something that the court is required to do, the remedy 3 is -- unless Congress provides otherwise, such as it 4 does in the Speedy Trial Act, the remedy is not a loss 5 of the power on the part of the court to act. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't the statute 7 establish time limits for filing an appeal? 8 MR. HEYTENS: The statute does, Your Honor. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it -- does it state a 10 remedy for it? I don't think so. But if you don't 11 comply with the time limit, you're too late; you can't 12 file the appeal. 13 MR. HEYTENS: Justice Scalia -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Same thing here. 15 MR. HEYTENS: There's a critical difference 16 between a statute of limitations for filing a notice of 17 appeal and what's happening here that's illustrated by 18 the example given by Judge Gorsuch in his opinion for 19 the courts of appeals. 20 There can be two kinds of time limits. The 21 first kind can say, if you want to do something -- you're 22 not required to do it -- but if you want to do it, 23 you have to do it within a certain time. That's what a 24 statute of limitations is. 25 The second kind of time limit is to say you

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 must do something and you must do it within a second -2 within a certain amount of time. This case is the 3 second category, just as the statute at issue in 4 Montalvo-Murillo was in the second category of cases, and 5 just as -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that that was a 7 bail question, where there's not issues of finality at 8 play, and bail is a question that repeats itself 9 throughout the proceedings. Defendants are denied bail 10 and then make a different showing of other 11 resources or less danger or whatever, and they get out. 12 And vice versa, defendants are out and are put in. 13 That's it. There are no finality questions there. 14 What do you do in this situation when you're 15 dealing with a criminal sentence where there are 16 finality rules? 17 And I'm going to tie that back to my starting 18 point, which is I'm looking in your brief for the 19 precedent and/or legal basis for us to treat restitution 20 as not part of the final judgment in this criminal 21 action. What -- what other examples do we have in the 22 criminal context? 23 MR. HEYTENS: We cited the things we cite in 24 our brief. There is, however, also a statute; I 25 apologize to the Court, it is not cited in our brief,

1 but it is section 18 U.S.C. section 3582(b). That 2 provision is captioned Imposition of a Sentence of 3 Imprisonment. Subsection (b) -- subsection (b) of that 4 provision says Effect of Finality of the Judgment. It 5 then says, "Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence of 6 imprisonment can subsequently be" modified or altered in 7 certain ways, and then this is the critical language: "a 8 judgment of conviction that includes such a sentence 9 constitutes a final judgment for all other purposes." 10 In this case there was a judgment of 11 conviction. It was entered on July 3, 2007. And that 12 judgment of conviction imposed a sentence of 13 imprisonment on Mr. Dolan. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, now suppose -- now 15 we're getting to exactly the point where I thought your 16 co-counsel, your sister counsel had a good point that I 17 wasn't -- hadn't thought through, and that is what 18 happens now in -- on day -- we're finished the 19 trial. The sentencing is over. They got the 20 presentence report, and the judge enters -- suppose he 21 entered a judgment but didn't say anything about 22 restitution, because he says: I'd like to give you a 23 chance to appeal this.

HEYTENS: We think because of that 7 provision and because of general principles of law. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Whoa, whoa. What about 9 what the -- what -- what you just heard quoted, 10 forgetting this particular sentence in the code, was that 11 a judgment isn't final -- you can only appeal a final 12 judgment until all the parts that are there, and the 13 restitution is part of it. And so until it's final, you 14 can't appeal it. That's what -- that's what the case 15 Parr, which it quoted. What is -- what is your response 16 to that? 17 MR.

To the extent what he says is, I think the 18 district court needs to, when it imposes the sentence of 19 restitution, take into account the other aspects of the 20 sentence, at that time the issues become interrelated. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me see if I understand 22 this. He has 14 days to appeal that.

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 inextricably mixed up with the rules of appeals, which are 2 very important. 3 So unless I have in my own mind how -- how 4 this all fits together, I -- I don't know how to decide 5 this case. I don't want to say something in here that's 6 going to muck up the -- the rules of appealing from a 7 criminal case. 8 Now, what you've told me is I'm supposed to say 9 that within 14 days of a -- of a judgment imposing imprisonment, 10 he has to appeal, but of course if it's supervised release, 11 he doesn't, or I'm not sure. 12 MR. HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, first and 13 foremost, the Court doesn't need to say anything about 14 any of these issues. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? 16 MR. HEYTENS: For one very simple reason: 17 The only thing that this defendant has ever attempted to 18 appeal at any point is the order of restitution. He 19 never attempted to appeal from his guilty plea. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but if -- but I have 21 to be able to write my reasons, and in doing that I have 22 to respond to the argument of the other side, which is 23 that the strongest reason for thinking Congress intended 24 this to be final and not beyond 90 days is that if you 25 don't do that, you muck up the rules of appeal. Now,
38 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 explain to me why that isn't so. 2 MR. HEYTENS: A couple of reasons, Your 3 Honor: First of all, I think it's actually one of the 4 strongest arguments against their position, because it 5 creates the unlikely scenario where it will be 6 routinely -- we know that Congress has authorized these 7 determinations to be made up to 90 days after the 8 imposition of sentence. So their rule would create the 9 situation where it would be completely consistent with 10 Congress's intent to routinely create a situation where 11 a Federal criminal defendant has to wait 3 months after 12 sentencing until he can appeal. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: Which is just what you say 14 he has to do if the sentence is supervised release. 15 MR. HEYTENS: What I'm saying, Justice 16 Breyer, is I -- I -- I know there is a statute that 17 governs imprisonment. I believe there is a similar 18 statute that governs a sentence of probation. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: What was that statute on 20 imprisonment? 21 MR. HEYTENS: 18 U.S.C. 3582(b), Justice 22 Scalia. I know there is a statute that governs that. 23 We also know there is a statute governing a term of 24 restitution itself. That's the provision cited, 3664(o), 25 which is reproduced at 11a of the appendix to our
39 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 brief -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I've got it. 3 MR. HEYTENS: -- which is the rules 4 governing finality with regard to an order imposing 5 restitution. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Heytens, one problem 7 with the -- we have said that notice of appeal -- that 8 that time limit is jurisdictional, which means if the 9 defendant misses that deadline, no appeal. And we're 10 leaving this in a nebulous state if the judge says, 11 within -- this is -- this is a judgment of conviction 12 and sentence, but I'm still thinking about the 13 restitution. 14 The defendant has to know at that point, 15 must I appeal that first judgment? Because if I don't, 16 I'll never be able to appeal it. 17 But on your reading, the defendant can't 18 wait. When the judge imposes a sentence, the defendant 19 must meet the time clock for notice of appeal from the 20 sentence. 21 MR. HEYTENS: That's correct, 22 Justice Ginsburg. In our view, the defendant -- when 23 the judgment of conviction was imposed on this case, 24 which imposed a sentence of imprisonment on Mr. Dolan, 25 the time for appealing the judgment of conviction and
40 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the term of imprisonment began to run. 2 If I could go back to Justice Breyer's 3 question -4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- that would 5 mean even if the judge says, I'm going to impose the 6 restitution order 10 days from now, defendant's time 7 clock for notice of appeal would begin at -- at the time 8 the sentence is imposed, not 10 days later when 9 restitution is -10 MR. HEYTENS: That's correct. He files a 11 notice of appeal when the judgment of conviction 12 is entered, and then 10 days later he can file a second 13 notice of appeal, and courts of appeal can consolidate 14 that case in the ordinary course. 15 You don't -- to answer Justice Breyer's very 16 specific question about the supervised released, I have 17 been advised that a district court cannot impose a term 18 of supervised release unless it also imposes a sentence 19 of imprisonment. So that particular hypothetical that 20 Justice Breyer raised wouldn't arise. The court 21 can't just -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, let's -23 let's suppose there's no 3664(d)(5), and we're back to 24 just 363(a)(1), which says when sentencing a defendant, 25 the court shall order restitution.

HEYTENS: I don't think so, Your Honor. 4 I think what -5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think even 6 without 3664(d)(5), the judge can say: I know it says 7 when I'm sentencing I've got to order restitution. 8 But 2 months later, he can do it? 9 MR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, let me 10 amend my answer slightly. He -- the judge is required 11 to do it when sentencing -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but nothing 13 happens if he doesn't. Is that -14 MR. HEYTENS: Well, the question then 15 becomes one of a remedy. The court is required to do it, 16 and the question becomes what is the remedy when the 17 court does not. And what the Court said in 18 Montalvo-Murillo is that we presume that Federal 19 district courts will comply with the law, and that it is 20 inappropriate in situations where Congress doesn't 21 specify a remedy for courts to impose their own remedy. 22 That was exactly the situation in Montalvo-Murillo. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Why don't we go back to my 24 hypothetical -25 MR.

1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and just substitute the 2 word "fine" for "supervised release." 3 MR. HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, I'm -- I'm fairly 4 certain there is a statute that addresses the finality 5 when it comes to a sentence that imposes a term of a 6 fine, which is similar to the statute that addresses 7 finality of a judgment of conviction that imposes only 8 a term of imprisonment. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not -- I'm not an 10 expert in this area, as you can see. And -- and I need 11 to have a place to go to look so that I can see that 12 these things, in your view, all work out, and you're 13 not creating some odd appellate system. Do you have any 14 suggestions for me as to what I could go and read and 15 look at that would help me? 16 MR. HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, to address 17 your very specific fine question, there is in fact a 18 statute that addresses that as well. That is 18 U.S.C. 19 3572(c). It's structured very similarly to the -- the 20 section regarding judgments of imprisonment that I 21 quoted to the Court earlier, and Congress has addressed 22 that. It says: "Notwithstanding the fact that a 23 sentence to pay a fine can subsequently be altered in 24 various respects, a judgment that includes such a 25 sentence is a final judgment for all other" --

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Can the (o) -- you 2 remember -- you know what I'm referring to by (o)? 3 MR. HEYTENS: Yes, Justice Breyer. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Can that be 5 read to refer to initial -- an initial judgment of 6 restitution as well as an amended judgment? 7 MR. HEYTENS: Absolutely, Justice Breyer. 8 That's exactly what the First Circuit said in the Cheal 9 case, which is cited in our brief. The First Circuit in 10 that case addressed an initial judgment that said, 11 similarly, somewhat, to the judgment in this one -- the 12 original judgment, if you recall, in this case says the 13 Mandatory Victims Restitution Act is applicable; 14 however, the court does not have sufficient information 15 to calculate restitution at this time. What the First 16 Circuit reasoned in Cheal is that that can be 17 interpreted as a judgment imposing a restitution 18 obligation, which is thus final under subsection (o). 19 If you conclude that, you don't need to look at any 20 other statute to resolve -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though there's no 22 amount given? 23 MR.

HEYTENS: Well, Justice Scalia, the 11 district court is not permitted to do any of this. 12 Congress has required the district court to set the 13 amount -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but 15 district courts don't always do what they are supposed 16 to. And it seems to me a very strange result that 17 you're -18 MR. HEYTENS: It's true that, regrettably, 19 district courts sometimes don't do what they are 20 supposed to. What this Court has said, most notably in 21 Montalvo-Murillo, is that we should assume that they 22 will, and that it's inappropriate for courts to craft 23 legal rules that are based on the presumption that they 24 are going to violate their legal obligations. 25 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this

May he 4 raise the issues about guilt and innocence and error in 5 the trial in that appeal? 6 MR. HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, just to make 7 sure I understand -- I want to make sure I understand 8 the hypothetical -- it's that the district court 9 sentences him, enters a judgment of conviction, and then 10 90 days later imposes an order of restitution? 11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Correct. 12 MR.

HEYTENS: We think this makes it an 5 easier case, in terms of it establishes that there is no 6 conceivable prejudice to Mr. Dolan as a result of the 7 delay in this case. 8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you this 9 question: If we conclude there's a hole in the statute 10 that Congress has to amend, is it more likely that 11 Congress will cure the statute if we rule for you or if 12 we rule against you? It's pretty clear, the answer to 13 that, isn't it? 14 MR. HEYTENS: Yes, Justice Stevens. I think 15 Montalvo-Murillo supplies the answer to that. 16 Montalvo-Murillo says, where Congress does not supply a 17 remedy for violation of a statutory time obligation, it 18 is inappropriate for courts to invent their own in order 19 to coerce district courts into complying -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So this then becomes a 21 goal, not a time line -- a deadline? 22 MR. HEYTENS: I think -- at some point, it 23 becomes a debate over precise wording, Justice Ginsburg. 24 I think it is a deadline. I think Congress intended for 25 district courts to do this. I think district courts who

1 have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws 2 of the United States are required to do it. 3 The question is: What is the remedy in the 4 rare, regrettable situation where they do not do it? And -5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So a -- a defendant 6 who is sentenced to a week in prison, and he decides, 7 that's no big deal, I'm not going to appeal, and then 8 finds out, you know, 90 days later he has got to pay a 9 million dollars in restitution, is just out of luck, 10 right? 11 MR. HEYTENS: Well, that would be -- yes. 12 That would be our view, Mr. Chief Justice. Now, what I 13 would say is, it is, first of all, our view that the Court 14 doesn't need to resolve any of this. But, second of all, 15 one of the reasons is there is another way the Court 16 could resolve this, which is to follow the approach the 17 Court took in its decision in Corey v. United States, 18 which is cited in the blue brief. 19 Now, Corey involved a statute. It's 20 presentence -- it's pre-Federal sentencing guidelines. 21 It involves a statute that said if, at the time of the 22 sentencing, the district court feels like it needs more 23 information to decide how long to send the defendant to 24 jail for, it may commit the defendant to the discretion 25 of the Attorney General for a period of either 3 to
48 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 6 months; get, essentially, a PSR, before there were 2 PSRs; and then make a determination then. 3 The Court in Corey faced the question: When 4 the district court does that -- it says, I'm going to 5 give you to the Attorney General, and we'll come back in 6 6 months and decide what your sentence will be -- when 7 does the defendant have to appeal? That was the 8 question before the Court in Corey. 9 What the Court said in Corey is that the 10 defendant may appeal either at the time he is committed 11 to the discretion of the Attorney General or at the time 12 the district court imposes the final sentence. The 13 reason the Court said that -- this is the language 14 that's cited in the blue brief -- is the Court said it 15 would be extraordinary to tell a Federal criminal 16 defendant that he might have to wait up to 6 months in 17 order to take a notice of appeal from his judgment of 18 conviction. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Look, you straightened me 20 out, from your point of view. But now you've mixed me 21 up again. 22 (Laughter.) 23 MR. HEYTENS: Sorry. I didn't realize, 24 Justice Breyer. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Because I think you said
49 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that the defendant is just out of luck. But, previously, 2 you had said that (o) applies, so I thought what you 3 were saying was that the sentence of imprisonment is 4 immediately appealable and must be appealed within 5 14 days because of that 3582. 6 MR. HEYTENS: That's our -7 JUSTICE BREYER: And then you said (o) 8 applies, and (o) says that a sentence that imposes an 9 order of restitution is a final judgment. So if (o) 10 applies, when, 8 months later or 20 months later, 11 that restitution is made final and embodied in another 12 judgment, that is a final judgment which can't be 13 appealed. 14 So if you're right about (o) applying, then 15 the answer to the question is, no, he is not out of 16 luck. Now, don't just agree with me because I seem to 17 be on your side in this question. 18 (Laughter.) 19 MR. HEYTENS: No -20 JUSTICE BREYER: I've got to figure this 21 out. 22 MR. HEYTENS: I apologize, Justice Breyer. 23 The government's position is that at the time the 24 judgment of conviction and the sentence of imprisonment 25 are entered, that is the time at which the defendant has
50 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to appeal and, in our view, he may appeal. Later, when 2 the sentence of restitution is imposed, that is when 3 he appeals that. 4 What I was suggesting is that, to the extent 5 the Court has any concern about that, the alternative 6 way of resolving this issue would be the same way the 7 Court approached the issue in Corey, and you could say 8 that the defendant could appeal at either time. 9 Now, we think that would be incorrect, but 10 it would be open to the Court to do so to -- or to leave 11 the issue open in order to resolve this case. Because 12 as I said before, this defendant never attempted to 13 appeal his judgment of conviction or his original term 14 of imprisonment. So it's not, in this case, necessary 15 to decide what exactly would have happened had he 16 attempted to do so. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: This criminal judgment of 18 restitution -- I assume it's the judge who finds that the 19 victim suffered so much money? 20 MR. HEYTENS: That's correct, 21 Justice Scalia. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does he find that beyond a 23 reasonable doubt? 24 MR. HEYTENS: No, Justice Scalia. The 25 burden --
51 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just more likely than not? 2 MR. HEYTENS: That's correct. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it's a criminal -4 it's a criminal judgment? 5 MR. HEYTENS: That's what Congress has 6 provided. And in this Court's decision in Oregon v. 7 Ice, the Court, admittedly in dictum, stated that 8 restitution determinations are a category of 9 determinations that have been historically made by the 10 court, not by the jury. And regardless of what anyone 11 thinks is the answer to that question, it is certainly 12 not within the question presented. It has not been 13 raised at any point by the Petitioner in this case. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose that an answer to 15 the Chief Justice's concern about the 1-week sentence and 16 -- and he's not concerned -- is that all criminal 17 defendants know that an adjudication of guilt is 18 preclusive of later issues with -- with respect to civil 19 -- civil liability, and they take their chances. 20 But that -- that points up a difference 21 between this case and Montalvo-Murillo. In this case, 22 finality is central to the system, and that wasn't -23 that's not really -- wasn't really true in Montalvo. 24 MR. HEYTENS: That's certainly correct, 25 Justice Kennedy. That was by its terms a bail
52 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 determination, which by its nature is not a final 2 determination in the sense that a criminal statute is, 3 though the Court's language doesn't really suggest that 4 that would make any difference. And I would say that 5 some of the other cases in this same line of cases, 6 including some of the ones Justice Breyer mentioned, did 7 raise finality concerns. There was a very strong 8 finality concern raised in the Peabody Coal case. There 9 were finality concerns raised in Brock, that Congress 10 had said this needs to be done, and once it's done, it 11 needs to be done. And so, there are -- some of the 12 cases in this same line have also involved finality, 13 admittedly not in the criminal context. 14 But I think the -- the most important thing 15 that the Court said in -- the two most important things 16 that the Court said in Montalvo-Murillo, as are relevant 17 here, is that, first, when Congress doesn't specify a 18 remedy -- and Congress has not specified a remedy in 19 this case -- it's inappropriate for courts to impose 20 their own. 21 The second thing that the Court said is that 22 we should presume that Federal district courts are going 23 to comply with legal obligations, and we shouldn't make 24 rules based on the assumption that they won't. 25 And third is that when courts do impose
53 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 remedies, they shouldn't make -- impose a remedy where 2 there's a profound lack of fit between the violation that 3 occurred and the remedy that the defendant is asking 4 them to impose. 5 Let me give you an example on that. The 6 general rule in Federal criminal litigation is that the 7 Federal district court is supposed to impose sentence 8 without unnecessary delay. Now, say the district court 9 violates that obligation. It takes too long to impose a 10 sentence. I think it would be extraordinary to suggest 11 that the remedy of a district court's unnecessary delay 12 in sentencing the defendant means the defendant should 13 get off scot-free. 14 The remedy is to tell the district court you 15 have taken too long to impose the sentence; impose the 16 sentence forthwith. 17 The same thing is true here. Congress has 18 told the district court you need to impose restitution 19 in every case where the defendant is convicted of a 20 crime of violence. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your argument is 22 "not to exceed 90 days" means the same thing as "without 23 undue delay"? 24 MR. HEYTENS: We don't think it means the 25 same thing, Mr. Chief Justice. What we think it means
54 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 is the violation should have the same consequences. The 2 violation is to say if you don't do what you are 3 supposed to, the remedy is to do it immediately. The 4 remedy isn't to say you don't have to do it anymore. 5 If there are no further questions, the 6 government urges that the judgment of the court below be 7 affirmed. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 9 Ms. Karlan, you have 4 minutes. 10 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN 11 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 12 MS. KARLAN: I have three points -- excuse 13 me -- to make: The first goes to what the remedy is 14 here and what the error is here. The error here 15 occurred when the district court did not impose 16 restitution. The government should have filed a timely 17 appeal under Rule 4. They had 30 days to do so. The 18 government did not appeal the failure to make 19 restitution. 20 That error is not before this Court now. 21 What's before this Court is a second judgment. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They couldn't do that 23 until the end of the 90 days. If the judge has 90 days 24 to order restitution, that's a vicious cycle argument. 25 MS. KARLAN: No, Justice Sotomayor, because
55 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 had the -- had the government on October 28 looked and 2 said, there's no restitution order in this case, they 3 could have filed an appeal then under Rule 4, and they 4 would have won. They didn't do so. 5 Second -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's rather 7 theoretical because if that -- I mean, the -- the judge 8 surely would have acted before he could process an 9 appeal. 10 MS. KARLAN: Well, he lacks actually the -11 the power to do that. Once the appeal is taken, he 12 can't do that. And may I just say that here I think the 13 critical rule to understand is one sentence, one appeal. 14 So turning first -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's not true. I 16 don't know if you've had time to look at 3582 or 35 -17 MS. KARLAN: Yes, I have. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those do appear to say 19 that once there's a term of imprisonment, that that 20 constitutes a final judgment. 21 MS. KARLAN: But they do so in the context 22 of Section 3553(a), which is cited on page 6 of the 23 yellow brief, which says "the court shall impose a 24 sentence." 25 Now, the different components can each be
56 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 added together. But there is one sentence in a criminal 2 case on a particular charge, and that sentence can 3 include restitution, it can include a fine, it can 4 include imprisonment. That doesn't make it three 5 sentences. And only when all of those have been imposed 6 is there a final judgment. Until then, the judgment -7 JUSTICE ALITO: It can also include 8 forfeiture. What's -- what is the rule for forfeiture? 9 MS. KARLAN: I don't know the rule for 10 forfeiture. I do know the rule for all of the other criminal 11 proceedings, which is 3582(b), to which the government 12 refers; 3572(c) for fines; 3562(b) for community 13 release; and 3664(o) for restitution. All of those have 14 to make one sentence, and then there is one appeal. 15 Under our rule, which I think comports with 16 the plain language of the statute, we know when an 17 appeal takes place, and there will be one appeal. Under 18 the government's rule -19 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference -- in 20 response to the last argument that your opponent made, 21 what is the difference between the provision here and 22 Rule 32(b)(1) of the criminal rules, the court must 23 impose sentence without unnecessary delay? 24 MS. KARLAN: There, the question is, did it 25 do it without unnecessary delay? Here the question is,
57 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 did it do it within 90 days? When it didn't, the 2 government had to appeal. The government did not do 3 that. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: So if the -- I didn't 5 understand the answer. If the sentence is not imposed 6 without unnecessary delay, the consequence is that there 7 can be no sentence? 8 MS. KARLAN: No. This Court has never 9 decided what the rule means there. But this is a 10 statute. And if I could turn to the question of what 11 the statute -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Before you do that, tell me 13 what the government appeal would consist of. The 90 days 14 has expired -15 MS. KARLAN: And the judgment of August 8th 16 became final. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you -- you tell 18 me the court -- the court has no ability to impose 19 restitution after 90 days. 20 MS. KARLAN: That's right. The -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the use of appealing? 22 MS. KARLAN: Because on appeal you say the 23 court erred, and it imposed an illegal sentence -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the appellate court says 25 too bad --
58 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MS. KARLAN: No -2 JUSTICE SCALIA -- 90 days are up. 3 MS. KARLAN: No, Justice Scalia. In the 4 same way that if a court failed to impose a mandatory minimum 5 sentence and there was a final judgment, the government 6 could appeal. And the fact that the initial sentence 7 didn't do that doesn't mean anything at that point. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is no time limit on 9 the mandatory minimum. 10 MS. KARLAN: But the -- but -- but, Your 11 Honor, if the government appeals an illegal sentence, 12 that sentence can be corrected and the new mandate from 13 the court of appeals saying you erred in not imposing 14 mandatory restitution starts the 90-day clock again. 15 Now, this is -16 JUSTICE BREYER: Could you go back to -17 could you go back to Justice Alito's question, 18 because -19 MS. KARLAN: Yes. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- that was exactly the 21 same thing. I think what he may be saying, though, is 22 it makes more sense to read these statutes as saying 23 imprisonment or community -- or community service, a 24 form of supervised release, or fines -- I don't know 25 about forfeiture -- can be appealed as separate final

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 judgments, because then you don't have to wait for 2 90 days. 3 MS. KARLAN: No. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: And if you read it that 5 way, it's fairer to the defendant, and you don't have to 6 worry about the restitution appeal because of (o). 7 Now, what blocks the reading -- what blocks 8 the reading I just gave? 9 MS. KARLAN: The principle that there must 10 be one sentence that determines each of the punishments 11 for a particular crime. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 13 The case is submitted. 14 (Whereupon, at 11:08 a.m., the case in the 15 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
