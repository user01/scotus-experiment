3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Case 141406, Nebraska v. Parker.

5             Mr. Smith.

6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. SMITH

7               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8             MR. SMITH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10             For over a century, the following three

11 things have been true in the disputed area.

12             First, the nonIndian population has always

13 been greater than 98 percent.

14             Second, the Tribe never exercised

15 jurisdiction.

16             And third, by contrast, the State of

17 Nebraska has governed the disputed area.

18             The story of the disputed area is that of a

19 land that long ago lost its Indian character, if it ever

20 had any.  The three things I mentioned at the outset

21 happened for a reason.  They happened because it was

22 the  or the intent of Congress in the context of the

23 times of the 1882 Act that the disputed area would be

24 diminished from the reservation.

25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If I understand your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 position correctly, you're not asking us to overrule

4

2 Solem?

3             MR. SMITH:  No.  No, Your Honor.  We are not

4 asking you to overrule Solem.  In fact, what we are

5 asking the Court to do is to imply  apply the entire

6 Solem rule and, in particular, the compelling third

7 factor of the subsequent circumstances of the land's

8 jurisdictional history.  As 

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  From what  from what

10 you just said and from your brief, I gathered  perhaps

11 I was wrong  that you are arguing for a de facto

12 diminishment test; that is, you pointed out the area has

13 been overwhelmingly populated by nonIndians and they 

14 they  they haven't attempted before to exercise

15 governing authority.

16             MR. SMITH:  Your Honor, we think the

17 de facto diminishment does fit within the third element

18 of the Solem test, which is the subsequent circumstances

19 of  of after the enactment.  And so obviously we would

20 not be opposed to the Court concluding and reaching this

21 decision on the grounds of de facto diminishment.

22             But we also think this case fits within this

23 Court's precedent under Solem, which would involve 

24 in  in our view, the third element of the test is

25 particularly strong and compelling in this case, while

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
5 1 in Solem, in that particular case, it was  it was  I 2 guess I would call fairly easy to distinguish because, 3 as Solem talks about as far as the events, what took 4 place after the Act, the focus should be  if you're 5 looking at intent of Congress, you should be looking at 6 what Congress is doing after the Act that is reflective 7 of not understanding essentially that they've diminished 8 the reservation. 9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a different Congress. 10 I mean, to say, you know, a later Congress did thus and 11 so, and therefore the earlier Congress, when it enacted 12 a particular statute, must have diminished.  That 13 doesn't make any sense. 14             MR. SMITH:  It  15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And  and  and moreover, 16 if  if the third factor is dispositive, as  as you 17 assert, you would not  we would not need the  the  18 the de facto diminishment doctrine whereby, by a sort 19 of, you know, adverse possession, a jurisdiction, 20 whether it's Indians or  or even a State that used to 21 have a jurisdiction over a particular area has forfeited 22 it by long, longaccepted usage to the contrary. 23             If  if that is true and  and if  if 24 the third factor is as important as you say, we would 25 not need that doctrine.  We  we would just find

2             MR. SMITH:  Well, and that would be

3 consistent with the concept that, if a party just  if

4 they belatedly assert a claim to having sovereign

5 authority over this, as in this case it's over a hundred

6 and some years after the land was open for settlement,

7 that  there  at least the Sherrill case, some of the

8 principles in that case would be supportive of de facto

9 diminishment.

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  As far as 

11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That case didn't involve

12 the  the diminishment.  Diminishment was not an issue.

13             MR. SMITH:  That  that is true.  I  I 

14 what I was referring to was the  the principle at

15 least decided in the case as far as a longstanding

16 assumption of jurisdiction by the State over an area

17 that is primarily nonIndian in  in population land

18 creates justifiable expectations, and if they did have

19 any sovereignty over it, they had long since forfeited.

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's not what you're

21 arguing here.  I  I  I understand you're arguing

22 diminishment, not  not adverse possession, so to

23 speak.

24             MR. SMITH:  We are arguing that it's no

25 longer part of the reservation.  We are not saying it 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Court could not find it under the de facto, but we do

7

2 think the facts of this case does fit within Solem.  And

3 if  and if the Court applies the Solem test, the State

4 should prevail in this case, which 

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't  the

6 other side says you did not raise a City of Sherrill

7 argument.  Do you agree with that?

8             MR. SMITH:  We have  we have 

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  A lot of the  a

10 lot of the arguments you make seem to sound more in a

11 City of Sherrilltype proposition, but you haven't

12 raised that argument, have you?

13             MR. SMITH:  We, I  I believe in

14 paragraphs  or pages 22, I think it's 25 of our brief,

15 we are at least citing Sherrill as  as precedent for

16 the principle of loss of sovereignty, loss of sovereign

17 control by the fact that the State has long exercised

18 the jurisdiction.

19             But our focus 

20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's based on what

21 Solem said.  Solem did bring up a de facto diminishment.

22 This is on page 471 of the opinion.

23             It says "On a more pragmatic level, we have

24 recognized that who actually moved onto the open

25 reservation lands is also relevant to deciding whether a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 surplus land Act diminished a reservation.  Where

8

2 nonIndian settlers flooded into the opening portion of

3 the reservation and the area has long since lost its

4 Indian character, we have acknowledged that de facto if

5 not de jure diminishment may have occurred."

6             This was the theme that was picked up in

7 Sherrill, but it's stated in Solem.

8             MR. SMITH:  Yes.  Yes.

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And may I  may I ask a

10 preliminary question?  We're talking about a liquor

11 license or alcoholic beverage license and a sales tax on

12 alcoholic beverages.  Does the State itself impose such

13 requirements, that is, a licensing requirement and a

14 sales tax?

15             MR. SMITH:  The State itself does impose

16 liquor license requirements.  They  they can in 

17 State of Nebraska has sales taxes, yes, Your Honor.

18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This tax was not imposed

19 by the Tribe  Tribe.  This was a statute of Congress

20 that permitted the Indians to do this, correct?

21             MR. SMITH:  My recollection was the Interior

22 Department approved the Tribe's request to have such an

23 ordinance, and then  the Tribe's ordinance then was in

24  in effect.

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Without jurisdictions,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
9 1 Tribes can't tax at will.  They have to get approval for 2 taxation, correct, from the Federal government? 3             MR. SMITH:  Your  your point would be 4 correct, Your Honor.  The Tribe has to request it.  They 5 have to have an ordinance.  It has to be approved by 6 agency of the Federal government.  Yes, that  that is 7 true, but it still involves granting authority to a  8 another sovereign. 9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What  what else  10 what else do you lose if this ruling is against you? 11 We've already circumscribed the powers of the Tribes on 12 their own reservations greatly, so what powers do you 13 lose? 14             You've already ceded to the Federal 15 government criminal prosecution powers.  So you're not 16 losing out on that.  What are you losing out on? 17             MR. SMITH:  Well, Your Honor, I  I  I 18 take this  it would be in the context of what are the 19 justifiable expectations of those who live in the 20 disputed area?  What would be significantly disrupted as 21 far as their justifiable expectations? 22             I would start off with the first thing  23 principle is just who governs you.  Your  we'd be 24 introducing an additional sovereign, the Tribe, into an 25 area which, for over 130 years, the Tribe has not
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 exercised any sovereign authority at all.

10

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Smith, can  can I take

3 you back to Justice Scalia's question?  You know,

4 because usually, at least now, we don't think much of

5 subsequent history of any kind.  Now, maybe they thought

6 a little bit more highly of it in the days when Solem

7 was written, but now it would  it's  it's pretty

8 much of a stretch to use subsequent legislative history

9 or subsequent history generally when we're dealing with

10 interpreting a statute.

11             And I'm just wondering:  Is there a reason

12 why it should be more credited here than in any other

13 context?

14             MR. SMITH:  The Court's precedent, I

15 believe, recognizes in the area of land surplus acts

16 that Indian land surplus acts are a unique animal from

17 your normal legislative analysis.  And that would be

18 because in the context of the times back before the turn

19 of, I guess, two centuries ago in the 1800s, Congress

20 would be doing land surplus acts in which the concept of

21 are we diminishing or not diminishing a reservation was

22 really nothing that Congress thought of.

23             You put that on the basic principle that

24 only Congress can diminish a reservation, it then

25 becomes the problem of how do we determine what Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 intended when, frankly, the reality of the Court's

11

2 precedent is, it's something that Court  or Congress

3 generally did not think of.  They were inconsistent.

4 And so the Solem test really evolves out of an attempt

5 to determine what was the intent of Congress at the

6 time, which then is why legislative history, subsequent

7 or  subsequent circumstances takes on greater

8 significance.

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When did  when did this

10 diminishment idea as a legal concept  you said when

11 Congress acted, they weren't thinking in terms of

12 diminishment.

13             When did diminishment become the big

14 question?

15             MR. SMITH:  Well, it becomes  it becomes a

16 big question when the issue is is it part of the

17 reservation 

18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But at what point in

19 time?  Because you  I thought you just made this

20 statement that in 1882 Congress wasn't thinking in terms

21 of diminishment.

22             MR. SMITH:  It becomes a big issue when the

23 issue is who  frankly, who has authority to govern?

24 Is this still part of the reservation or not?  Does the

25 Tribe have any authority over this area at all?  And if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 it's part of the reservation, it has authority;

12

2 acknowledged, it is limited authority, but it would have

3 authority over it, because if it's part of the

4 reservation.  Now 

5             JUSTICE ALITO:  On that question, as a

6 practical matter, if the Tribe were to exercise  go to

7 the outer limits of its authority, what could it do in

8 the city of Pender besides opposing this liquor tax?

9             MR. SMITH:  Well, what it can do, it can

10 displace State jurisdiction over environmental

11 regulations that this is a rural farming area.  The

12 environment is very important.  State regulation is very

13 important.  It's what the people have expected.  And I

14 could give an example:  If you're a farmer, and the guy

15 across the road drops a load of manure in your pond

16 that's being used to feed cattle, you call the State of

17 Nebraska; you want them to come out and you want them to

18 do something.  Those regulations would be replaced.  You

19 call the State of Nebraska and the response is I'm sorry

20 you've called the wrong number.

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about municipalities?

22 What about selfgoverning  or more or less

23 selfgoverning municipalities?  Are there any of those

24 within this area?

25             MR. SMITH:  Yes.  There are selfgoverning

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 municipalities.  There are villages.  County,

13

2 obviously 

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What  would happen to

4 them?  Would they continue to  to exist?

5             MR. SMITH:  They would continue to exist,

6 but you're going to have, what I would say, the

7 ambiguity of the extent of their authority versus the

8 extent of the Tribe's authority.  You would have this

9 ambiguity in which is going to be  I mean, people for

10 130 years, if you've expected the State of Nebraska,

11 your city council to be exercising local control, and

12 you bring in this outside authority 

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why would they continue to

14 exist?  I mean, aren't they creatures of the State?  Can

15 the State create municipalities on Indian Reservations?

16             MR. SMITH:  I believe  I believe the State

17 can create the municipalities.  The issue is what

18 authority they have when you also have it on Tribal

19 land, because the Tribe 

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  The Tribe

21 has acceded to State sovereignty and the environment and

22 in all sorts of things.

23             Have they threatened to take away the

24 State's activities in this village?

25             MR. SMITH:  Not yet.  The issue is going to

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This Tribe is awfully

3 small.  You think they are going to have the power to

4 implement all of these things that you are fearful of?

5 To do substitute services to  they can't tax for it

6 without the government's permission.  So how are they

7 going to do all these, and why would they do all these

8 horrible things?

9             MR. SMITH:  Well, I don't think it's 

10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, it's nice to

11 have the power of taxation, but they still need the

12 government's approval.

13             MR. SMITH:  I don't think it's simply the

14 test of being what  what will they do.  I think the

15 issue is once they have the authority, what 

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the question of

17 the City of Sherrill says if they try to exercise their

18 powers in a way that's harmful to settled expectations,

19 they might have a remedy in law.  That's what City of

20 Sherrill says, but that didn't take away  the City of

21 Sherrill didn't say the Indians weren't sovereign.  It

22 just said they can't exercise the sovereignty.  It

23 didn't say it was a diminishment.  What they said is

24 they couldn't exercise it because of latches.

25             MR. SMITH:  Well, if you say we've

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 introduced a tribe that in theory has authority, but

15

2 because they've never exercised it, they really have no

3 authority that  that by itself, I would say, is the

4 inherent ambiguity of what is actually the limits of

5 their authority.  You get litigations that start

6 disputing whether  like under the Montana factors, as

7 far as they could regulate conduct that threatens, has

8 some direct effect on their tribe's integrity, economic

9 security, health and welfare.  That's very, very broad.

10 And I  to me, the  the answer would be simply to say

11 this is not part of the reservation, rather than every

12 case that comes up when we have litigation and then

13 decide well, you're stopped from doing that.

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if  does the

15 Tribe exercise authority in the part of the reservation

16 that's not at issue here?

17             MR. SMITH:  Yes.  The Tribe absolutely

18 exercises authority in the part that's not part of the

19 reservation.  They've stipulated to that, that on the

20 part that's not part of the reservation that they 

21 that they have ordinances, they provide services, that

22 they enforce their ordinances on the east  in the

23 eastern part of the railroad, which is the  clearly

24 within the Tribe and not on the west.  So they have had

25 no presence, and they've acknowledged that.  They have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 no Tribal offices, schools, industries, businesses.

16

2 They've admitted that all of these governmental services

3 are provided by state and local agencies, not the Tribe.

4 That's the public expectation.  That's what they expect

5 is 

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In the  in the

7 western part?

8             MR. SMITH:  In the western part.

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what about in

10 the eastern part?

11             MR. SMITH:  I'm sorry if I wasn't clear.

12             In our  in the eastern part, the Tribe

13 does have its ordinances.  It does provide services.  It

14 does enforce its ordinances and laws in the eastern

15 part, but not in the western part, and never has.  All

16 of those services are provided by the State of Nebraska.

17 The State of Nebraska, you name it in the form of

18 government services have been provided by the State of

19 Nebraska, its municipalities, not by the Tribe.  This

20 comes in  we come in; we're going to tax you; we're

21 going to take the money; and maybe you get services,

22 maybe you don't.  And, in fact, the idea of local

23 control is if the people in the disputed area are

24 unhappy about what the Tribe is doing, unlike if it's

25 their local city council, they don't get to vote.  They

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 don't get to remove them from office 

17

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Smith, I  I can

3 understand why people might be concerned, for all the

4 reasons that you're talking about.  We do have pretty

5 clear and settled law in this area with respect to

6 diminishment, that we've said only Congress can

7 diminish, that the idea is that we're supposed to look

8 to congressional intent.  And you say Congress didn't

9 really think in these terms.  And there's something

10 that's fair about that.

11             But Congress did use very different language

12 in different ones of these acts, and we've looked to

13 that language as a pretty good guide to suggesting which

14 ones diminish and which ones do not.  And it seems as

15 though the language here in  in the act in which we're

16 concerned  it's  it's none of the language that

17 would suggest that Congress diminished this act.

18             So I was wondering if you could talk to

19 that.  Is there anything in the language of this statute

20 that suggests a diminishment?  Any of the usual kind of

21 we cede everything, we relinquish everything?  Like,

22 what's the best you can do on that?

23             MR. SMITH:  Appreciate that, Your Honor.

24             And  and yes, the standard diminishment

25 test starts with looking at the Act.  Is there language

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
18 1 in the Act?  Hagen and Solem both specifically say no 2 particular form of words are required. 3             What we do have in this Act is we've got two 4 areas of the reservation.  The area west of the 5 reservation, it's a very welldefined area.  It doesn't 6 create a checkerboard effect. 7             What is significant is the different  the 8 Act treats the area west of the railroad different than 9 the area east of the railroad.  Specifically  and this 10 is a major distinction in Solem  there is nothing 11 reserved for the Tribe in the land on the west of the 12 railroad, the disputed area.  There's nothing reserved 13 for  in the bullpen, so to speak.  There is no 14 reservation of landuse rights.  There's no reservation 15 of landuse rights for schools, agency, Tribal religious 16 purposes, no reservation in mineral rights. 17             In Solem those were considered significant 18 factors because what you end up with is that the Tribal 19 headquarters, its governmental headquarters ended up in 20 Solem being in the disputed area. 21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Counsel, do you agree that 22 City of Sherrill did nothing more than deny particular 23 equitable relief and did not repudiate the proposition 24 of Indian sovereignty over the land in question? 25 Because if you agree with that, then I guess I'm more

2 But if you disagree with it, as I think you ought to,

3 then  then I don't see why we need the third factor.

4             MR. SMITH:  Well, City of Sherrill, it does

5 have the element of the Tribe trying to unilaterally

6 just 

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but it says the Tribe

8 doesn't have sovereignty, is what it says.

9             MR. SMITH:  It  well, it says the Tribe

10 doesn't have sovereignty just to buy land back and get

11 back sovereignty that it had long ago lost 

12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's right.

13             MR. SMITH:   and it applies equitable

16 Tribe does not have sovereignty.

17             MR. SMITH:  Yes.  Yes.  And I  and I think

18 it's perfectly reasonable for the Court to reach that

19 conclusion with a land which long ago it lost its Indian

20 character, long ago they've  they've never exercised

21 any sovereignty, and then show up after the public, the

22 descendants, everyone who's lived there, and after 130

23 years you suddenly find out we  we've got an Indian

24 Tribe that somehow has some governmental authority over

25 us.

If we don't like what 3 we're going to do, I guess we can complain to somebody, 4 but we can't recall members of the Tribal Council. 5 It's  it is a recognition that those things happened 6 because that's what Congress intended to have happen, 7 and as Solem looks in the context of the times. 8             As far as that legislative history or 9 what  what happened afterwards, Solem emphasizes the 10 decades immediately after the Act.  And in the decades 11 immediately after this Act, we don't have what Solem 12 talks about, the rife with inconsistencies.  What we 13 have is a total, one hundred percent consistent record 14 that everyone understood. 15             This land was diminished.  It's not part of 16 the reservation.  Congress in  eighty, ninetysix 17 years later, and I understand the point about subsequent 18 congressional intent, but at least they did not take an 19 action that would reflect Congress didn't understand 20 what they did. 21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Smith, on the City of 22 Sherrill point, the Chief Justice asked you before do 23 you agree whether this was  whether this is waived. 24 And you said, well, we cite City of Sherrill on page 25 25 or something like that.

SMITH:  The  in the lower courts, the 4 argument  the argument was made as far as that de 5 facto diminishment can be found.  The Eighth Circuit's 6 opinion is what I would call a  7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm not sure quite what that 8 means.  Does that mean de facto diminishment under 9 Solem, or does that mean  Solem  or does that mean 10 that you talked about City of Sherrill as an independent 11 ground? 12             MR. SMITH:  We talked about de facto 13 diminishment as an independent ground.  I didn't argue 14 it, but my  my recollection is Sherrill is not cited 15 for  as authority for that, but we did make the 16 argument that it was de facto because Solem does say we 17 have recognized de facto diminishment. 18             Mr. Chief Justice, if  if I may reserve 19 the remainder of my time if there's no further 20 questions. 21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you. 22             Mr. Clement. 23             ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 24           ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTS 25             MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
Alderson Reporting Company

1 please the Court:

Official

22

2             The question in this case is whether an 1882

3 Act of Congress diminished the Omaha Reservation and

4 redrew its boundaries.  We think multiple considerations

5 make clear that the Act of Congress did not diminish the

6 reservation, but simply opened up a portion of the

7 reservation for settlement within the existing

8 boundaries.

9             Now the first, and probably most

10 significant, factor is that the text of the statute uses

11 the classic language this Court has identified for

12 opening up a reservation for settlement without creating

13 a diminishment.

14             But secondly, and I think very telling and

15 specific to this statute, at the same time there is no

16 language in the statute that supports a finding of

17 diminishment.  I think there is language in the statute.

18 Specifically, the final proviso of Section 8 that is

19 very inconsistent with the idea that what Congress did

20 is draw a new western boundary to the reservation,

21 because the  that proviso gave Tribal members the

22 right to take their allotments east or west of the

23 rightofway.

24             And the record reflects that many  that 

25 that a number of members of the Tribe took their

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
23 1 allotments west of the rightofway.  And importantly, a 2 number of them took their allotments that actually 3 straddled the rightofway. 4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What number? 5 What  what is the number? 6             MR. CLEMENT:  There are 15  7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Nine? 8             MR. CLEMENT:  No, 15, I think  well, the 9 parties dispute  between 10 and 15, about 850 to 900 10 acres.  But I don't think  11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Out  out of how 12 many that took allotments? 13             MR. CLEMENT:  Out of how many Tribal 14 members?  I think there were roughly 300plus 15 allotments.  So it was, you know, three percent. 16             But I think the fact that they were allowed, 17 even though they're small numbers  I'm not trying to 18 make a  a volume argument here.  I'm making an 19 argument that if what Congress just did was draw a new 20 western boundary to the reservation, it would have been 21 very odd to allow Tribal members to take their 22 allotments off the reservation, and maybe odder still to 23 allow them to take an allotment that essentially was 24 bisected by the new boundary. 25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why would that be
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
24 1 odd?  They  they could have taken allotments anywhere, 2 couldn't they  3             MR. CLEMENT:  Anywhere  4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   within the area 5 that was opened up?  Couldn't they have chosen to 6 purchase their  7             MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think  8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   or take 9 allotments outside the reservation? 10             MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think that would have 11 been a logical assumption, given the conception of the 12 time, where I think Congress was thinking in the main 13 that Tribal ownership or Indian ownership went with the 14 reservation status. 15             And I think, again, if you think of this as 16 being a Surplus Land Act that simply opens the 17 reservation up, a portion of it to settlement, then it 18 makes perfect sense to say the Tribal members can take 19 their allotments anywhere on the reservation. 20             But if you think you've really drawn a new 21 boundary to the reservation, then I think it's more than 22 passing strange that you can take allotments to the west 23 of it, or you can take an allotment and the new border 24 is smack dab through the middle of it.  That  25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't understand the 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
25 1 your answer to the Chief Justice's question.  An Indian 2 who wanted to have an allotment off the reservation, and 3 allotments were generally available, could take that 4 allotment off the reservation if the Indian chose to do 5 so, correct? 6             MR. CLEMENT:  No.  My position is no, they 7 couldn't.  And they could take it west of the 8 rightofway, but I am saying that's how  9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Allotments were only open 10 to nonIndians? 11             MR. CLEMENT:  No, no.  Before any settlers, 12 nonIndians, came in, the existing Tribal members were 13 allowed to take their allotments. 14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right. 15             MR. CLEMENT:  And they were allowed to take 16 their allotments anywhere on the preexisting 17 reservation. 18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  So we're not 19 talking about allotments open to the general population? 20             MR. CLEMENT:  No.  No. 21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Thank you. 22             MR. CLEMENT:  And  and this is clear from 23 the proviso in Section 8.  It's the allotment only for 24 members of the Tribe.  And they can take, consistent 25 with the historical understanding, an allotment anywhere
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
26 1 on the reservation, including west of the rightofway. 2 And that seems to me to be very consistent with the idea 3 that the rightofway is an interesting thing that the 4 Tribe granted through their reservation, but it's not 5 some new boundary.  And I think the subsequent history 6 really supports that as well. 7             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you mean  8             MR. CLEMENT:  I mean, my friend on the other 9 side  10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what do you mean, 11 Mr. Clement, of the language that I read from Solem 12 itself which seems to fit this case? 13             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I take that language, 14 Justice Ginsburg, as Justice Marshal writing for the 15 Court saying that when you're in the third factor, when 16 you witness de facto immunity  I'm sorry  de facto 17 sort of diminishment, that that may ultimately support a 18 conclusion that there was in fact diminishment as a 19 matter of law. 20             I don't take him to be opening up an 21 entirely different route to finding immunity  22 diminishment, rather, that doesn't go through an act of 23 Congress.  And I think that's the only way to read the 24 opinion as a whole because when the Court starts the 25 opinion, it says the very first principle in this area
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 is that only Congress can diminish a reservation.

27

2             And it's perfectly compatible with that to

3 say that when we get to the third factor and we're

4 looking at all sorts of things, we'll look at settlement

5 patterns as part of that.  But I don't think it's

6 consistent with that world view to then say that,

7 actually, the third factor is a standalone alternative

8 route to find diminishment, not by congressional action,

9 but by market reaction to a surplus land Act.

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did  did  did we cite

11 Solem in Sherrill?  I  I don't really recall.

12             MR. CLEMENT:  I  I  I don't recall.

13 I 

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  If it held that, it would

15 have been  it would have been cited and Sherrill would

16 not have been any big deal.

17             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I  I  I think

18 that 

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought Sherrill was a

20 big deal.

21             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think  I think 

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Justice Ginsburg wrote it.

23 I think she thought it was a big deal.

24             (Laughter.)

25             MR. CLEMENT:  I'm not here to tell you it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
28 1 not a big deal.  I am telling  I'm here to tell you 2 two things, though. 3             One is that Solem went out of its way to not 4 decide the diminishment issue.  So it is clearly an 5 alternative way of thinking about the cases, and I don't 6 think they're coextensive.  Which is to say, I think 7 there could be a particular assertion of Tribal 8 authority that you might say violates City of Sherrill 9 principles, even within an undiminished reservation. 10             And I do think it's then critically 11 important that  my friend on the other side has not 12 raised this argument below.  I certainly did not 13 understand it to be an independent argument in this 14 Court.  It's all well and good to cite the case, but 15 that doesn't make it an independent argument. 16             Even his amici, who thought that they wanted 17 to bring before this Court the City of Sherrill 18 argument, admitted that the Petitioners hadn't made a 19 City of Sherrill argument. 20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But  but Solem did 21 talk about de facto diminishment.  And it seems to me 22 that you've got to recognize when they do that, they're 23 talking about something other than de jure, in other 24 words, pursuant to the law.  It's pursuant to the facts 25 on the ground.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. CLEMENT:  I understand,

29

2 Mr. Chief Justice, but I think there's two ways to talk

3 about de facto v. de jure.  One way to talk about it is

4 that they're two totally alternative routes.  Another

5 way is to say de facto diminishment means the settlement

6 patterns, and that's something that can inform the

7 ultimate conclusion of whether there's diminishment.

8             And I really think the Court in Solem was

9 using it in that passage in the latter respect.  And I

10 think that's the only way to make sense of the case as a

11 whole, because 

12             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Except that it's  it's

13 presented before the Court turns to apply the

14 principles.

15             MR. CLEMENT:  Exactly.  That's right.  It's

16 part of the general principles of the Court 

17             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's  it's not  it's

18 not tied to the third factor.

19             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I  I  I take,

20 though, that it actually is, in my view, tied to the

21 third factor.  I think Justice Marshall was laying out

22 all of the factors, starting with the first and

23 governing principle, being that only Congress can

24 diminish.  And he winds up the sort of general principle

25 section with this last thing about de facto/de jure 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
30 1 de facto diminishment, and then that ties up exactly to 2 his discussion of settlement patterns in the third 3 factor of Solem.  And I really think that's the right 4 way to read that opinion. 5             I would like to make one other very 6 important point here, though, is I think the Court 7 should understand that if you were to rule in favor of 8 Petitioners in this case, the parties would essentially 9 have to go back and reconstruct the rightofway because 10 the railroad is no longer there.  There's no 11 RailsForTrails program in Thurston County.  So if you 12 take a Google map and look at this area, you can't even 13 tell where the rightofway was. 14             Now, I think that's significant, because if 15 there really was a contemporaneous understanding in the 16 1950s and 1960s, when the railroad literally pulled up 17 its tracks and left, that the rightofway was the 18 boundary of the reservation, then I think there would 19 have been some effort to sort of preserve that 20 jurisdictional boundary. 21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well  well  well, 22 please correct me if I'm wrong from the record.  My  23 my understanding was in the west portion, the Tribe had 24 done  had exercised no jurisdiction until the Beverage 25 Control Ordinance recently, but on the east portion,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
31 1 that they had.  But then you say, well, we can't tell 2 the difference in east and west. 3             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I  I  I  4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I mean, is  is that 5 reading of the record mistaken? 6             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I  I think what there 7 is is a practical understanding  as Justice Sotomayor 8 indicated, this is not a wealthy Tribe that's looking to 9 assert jurisdictions in places that are impractical.  So 10 it's made a judgment that most of its efforts are 11 directed at the eastern portion of the reservation. 12             But what I'm saying is  13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What  what  but does 14 the fact that nothing, if  if the record is correct  15 let's assume the record shows that the Tribe exercised 16 no jurisdiction over the western portion until this 17 alcoholic Beverage Control Ordinance.  Is that relevant 18 to the case at all? 19             MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think it's 20 dispositive.  I think, yes, it's  21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it relevant? 22             MR. CLEMENT:  Yes, relevant. 23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why is it  why is it 24 relevant?  To what point? 25             MR. CLEMENT:  It  it  I think it could
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
32 1 be relevant to the third factor of Solem in a case where 2 the situation was very cloudy. 3             But one of the things also to keep in mind 4 is that even before Montana, the authority that a Tribe 5 would have over a principal nonIndian settlement on a 6 reservation is fairly limited.  And if you're  7             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Limited to what? 8             MR. CLEMENT:  What's that? 9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What  what  what does 10 it state beside the alcohol tax  sales tax?  What 11 else, on your theory, could the Tribe do in the way of 12 governance in this area? 13             MR. CLEMENT:  I think as a practical matter, 14 Justice Ginsburg, there's two other things that are at 15 stake here, and they both go to the equities of the 16 Indians on the reservation, not the nonIndians, because 17 the nonIndians on the reservation, the Tribal authority 18 is very, very limited. 19             So one thing that is at issue here is the 20 potential to continue the revenuesharing agreement with 21 the State.  And this is something that the State 22 actually came to the Tribe about.  And the theory of the 23 revenuesharing agreement for the fuel taxes is that 24 there are going to be transactions in the western 25 portion of the reservation where it's actually Tribal
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
33 1 members that are buying gasoline over there, which does 2 happen, because there are a lot of gas stations over 3 there.  And of course, the Tribe would have authority to 4 tax the Tribal members on the reservations for those  5 those transactions.  So what  6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You  you  7 Justice Ginsburg asked you a question, you said, as a 8 practical matter.  I thought  maybe I misinterpreted 9 her question here  as a legal matter.  As a legal 10 matter, if you prevail, can the Tribe cast any doubt on 11 the authority and the jurisdiction of the existing 12 municipality? 13             MR. CLEMENT:  No, not at all.  What they can 14 do is they can make cooperative agreements with the 15 State of Nebraska to tax Indians when they make 16 purchases in Pender. 17             And the other thing they can do is that, 18 when two Tribal members get in a scuffle in the village 19 of Pender, the Tribal authorities can be contacted, and 20 that matter can be handled in the Tribal courts  21             JUSTICE ALITO:  If the City of  22             MR. CLEMENT:   rather than the State 23 court. 24             JUSTICE ALITO:  If the City of Pender is on 25 a reservation, under what authority could the Town of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Pender regulate things that go on in Pender?

34

2             MR. CLEMENT:  Under  under its

3 authority  first of all  I  I mean, you know, let

4 me say two things:

5             One is:  I'm not even sure, because of the

6 retrocession under  after Public Law 280, it's not

7 even clear to me that Nebraska ceded its civil

8 jurisdiction that it enjoyed under 280.  The  the

9 retrocession, as I understand it, was criminal

10 retrocession with the exception of the motor vehicle

11 laws.

12             The second thing:  As a practical matter, I

13 think this is very important to understand.  The next

14 town east from Pender is the Town of Walthill.  It is

15 unambiguously in the reservation boundaries.  It is an

16 incorporated municipality of the  of sort of civil

17 government of Nebraska.

18             In the Winnebago reservation 

19             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, just educate me

20 because I  I don't know the law on this point.  Can 

21 excuse me.

22             Can a State incorporate municipalities

23 within the boundary of a Indian Reservation?

24             MR. CLEMENT:  Yes.  It can, and it does, and

25 it's quite common.  And what this Court  in fact, this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Court in  in  in the Seymour case, one of its

35

2 earliest diminishment cases, confronted a Federal

3 township, Omak, Washington, that had always been a

4 township.  There's civil authority there, but it's still

5 on the reservation.  And that is actually quite common.

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does that displace

7 Tribal authority in that area?

8             MR. CLEMENT:  No.  Because again, remember,

9 the Tribal authority over the nonIndians is so small.

10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the  the 

11 we're talking about the area.

12             Can Tribal  Tribal police patrol within

13 the municipality?

14             MR. CLEMENT:  I think they probably could.

15 The only, really  with an eye towards seeing if there

16 were Indians there who were, you know, needing

17 patrolling.  And there's some evidence in the record 

18 this is at Joint Appendix 371 and 372  that there were

19 occasional patrols of the Tribe into Pender.  There's

20 also a footnote in that same section that says that as a

21 practical matter, when a Tribal member was apprehended

22 in the Village of Pender, the police officer would call

23 over to the Tribal authorities and have them take over

24 the person.

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So there's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 overlapping jurisdiction?  The municipality and the

36

2 Tribe 

3             MR. CLEMENT:  Yes.

4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   within the city?

5             MR. CLEMENT:  Within the city.  And one

6 other aspect 

7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Doesn't that create

8 conflict?

9             MR. CLEMENT:  No.  It really hasn't created

10 significant conflict.  And what eliminates the conflict

11 is your Montana decision which substantially limits the

12 Tribe's authority over the non 

13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the  the liquor tax

14 that we're talking about is not imposed only on Indians,

15 right?  It's imposed on everybody who buys liquor in

16 Pender.

17             MR. CLEMENT:  It  it is, but that is the

18 exception that proves the rule, because alcohol on

19 reservations has been a unique Federal authority for as

20 long as there's been Indian Reservations.  In fact, this

21 Court had a case in 1911 arising out of the Omaha

22 reservation where it reaffirmed the Federal authority.

23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So on Indian Reservation

24 lands, I take it Tribal police have jurisdiction over

25 nonIndians as to minor offenses?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. CLEMENT:  I  I don't think that's

37

2 actually true on the ground in Nebraska, at least as to

3 the highways.  Because when they retroceded authority in

4 1970 

5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you  you have the

6 example of a scuffle.  Suppose an Indian and a

7 nonIndian are in a scuffle.  If  if there's a  a

8 minor criminal statute making this a minor offense, does

9 the Tribe have jurisdiction over the nonIndian?

10             MR. CLEMENT:  I  I don't think that it

11 would within the Village of Pender.  And I think that is

12 a reflection of the very limited authority that the

13 Tribe has over nonIndians 

14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's true with

15 reference to all Indian tribes?  Can you cite me any

16 proposition for that?

17             MR. CLEMENT:  Well, ultimately, it might

18 be  it might turn on the scope of the Montana

19 decision.  And obviously, this Court has the Dollar

20 General decision in front of it.  I want to make one

21 more point, if I could, about the overlapping

22 authorities here, cause the other authority here is

23 Thurston County, if I just finish this one point.

24             Pender is the County seat of Thurston

25 County.  Thurston County has  by State statute since

8               ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM

9            ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT

10             MR. KEDEM:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11 please the Court:

12             In Solem v. Bartlett, this Court explained

13 that once a block of land is set aside as an Indian

14 Reservation and no matter what happens to the title of

15 individual plots within the area, the entire block

16 retains its reservation status until Congress explicitly

17 indicates otherwise.  It has not done so here.

18             I'd like to start, if I may, with the

19 question:  What would change if this Court were to rule

20 that the reservation is still intact?  First of all,

21 with respect to services, States can provide services to

22 members of tribes and nonmembers alike anywhere within

23 the reservation.  And the State of Nebraska provides

24 services not only in the disputed area but on the east

25 side as well.

Alderson Reporting Company

1             Let me give you a very specific example.

39

2 There's a town called Bancroft, which is split in half

3 by the rightofway.  There's another town called

4 Rosalie, which is clearly within the eastern undisputed

5 part of the reservation.  There's a school district

6 called the BancroftRosalie School District, which is

7 administered under the auspices of the State of

8 Nebraska.  And that is true notwithstanding the fact

9 that much of the land is on the east side, and true

10 notwithstanding the fact that many members  many

11 students who go to that school are members of the Tribe.

12             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's what  what the

13 State can do, but the State wouldn't be obliged to do

14 that, wouldn't be obliged to provide schools?

15             MR. KEDEM:  I see no basis for the State to

16 refuse to provide services to its own citizens,

17 especially if they are not members of the Tribe.

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it would be a

19 question of sovereignty.

20             MR. KEDEM:  The State 

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This is  this is

22 the reservation.  That's your argument.  It's the

23 reservation, and that's not the  the State land, so

24 we're going to spend our money for schools or whatever

25 on the  in the State, not on the reservation.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. KEDEM:  The State retains regulatory

40

2 sovereignty to make laws with respect to its own

3 citizens and nonmembers on a reservation.  That's true

4 on the east side.  It's true on the west side.

5             I think you also may be left with the

6 impression, after my friend's argument, that the State

7 would stop issuing environmental permits and all of a

8 sudden the Tribe would start issuing them.  That is not

9 correct.  First of all, the Environmental Protection

10 Agency has been administering on the west side of the

11 reservation, including providing permits for animal feed

12 lots.  There's also a permit for wastewater 

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The Environmental

14 Protection Agency, which  the State or Federal?

15             MR. KEDEM:  Federal.  Federal.

16              including a permit for a wastewater

17 treatment facility, although I believe it discharges

18 into Logon Creek on the east side; so it may not tell us

19 all that much about the jurisdiction.

20             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But our  our questions

21 have been, suppose that you prevail, what can the State

22 do?  And we say, oh, it's a practical matter.  Don't

23 worry.  They won't do  the Tribe won't do anything.

24 The Tribe won't do anything.  What could the Tribe do?

25             MR. KEDEM:  What could the Tribe do?

Alderson Reporting Company

41 1             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, to regulate nonTribal 2 members. 3             MR. KEDEM:  So the things that the Tribe 4 could do would be any express delegation of authority 5 from Congress.  The only one that we've heard about is 6 the alcohol ordinance.  Beyond that, the State and Tribe 7 could go back  8             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We heard about the 9 fuel  the revenue sharing of the fuel. 10             MR. KEDEM:  That's right.  There was an 11 agreement to share revenue fuel, although that was 12 something that the State entered into voluntarily with 13 the Tribe.  Beyond that, the Tribe would have to fall 14 under one of the two Montana exceptions, which are, as 15 this Court is aware of because of the Dollar General 16 case, very limited. 17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose one reason 18 the Tribe might  might not provide services is because 19 the area is 98pointwhatever percent nonTribal, right? 20             MR. KEDEM:  I think that's absolutely 21 correct. 22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So they would be  23 any services would be for the  how many?  Nine  nine 24 Indians in the area or 15? 25             MR. KEDEM:  Pardon?

42 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How many nonIndians 2 own land in the western part? 3             MR. KEDEM:  It's almost entirely nonIndian 4 in the western part.  And for the  5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Couldn't the Tribe enact 6 ordinances that govern the Indians in the  in the 7 western part? 8             MR. KEDEM:  They could, but if we're talking 9 about the effect on nonmembers, they would have to fall 10 under the one  one of the two Montana exceptions. 11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  But at least as to 12 Tribal members in the west  13             MR. KEDEM:  That's right.  Tribal members on 14 the reservation  15             JUSTICE SCALIA:   they would be subject to 16 the Tribe's jurisdiction which they otherwise would not? 17             MR. KEDEM:  I think that that's accurate. 18 If I could go to the City of Sherrill argument, which 19 got brought up a lot today.  I think this case is 20 extremely different from the City of Sherrill for a 21 number of reasons, but let me give you two big ones. 22             In the City of Sherrill, this Court held 23 that principles of equity restrained the Tribe from 24 trying to resurrect a claim of inherent sovereign 25 immunity.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             In this case by contrast, first of all,

43

2 we're not just talking about the Tribe's jurisdiction.

3 We're talking about the jurisdiction of the United

4 States as well.

5             And second of all, we're not talking about a

6 claim of inherent authority.  This is authority

7 exercised pursuant to a Federal statute, 18 U.S.C. 1161.

8 And it  for that reason, principles of equity simply

9 don't apply here.

10             Moreover, in City of Sherrill 

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand that.

12 Try  try it again.

13             MR. KEDEM:  Sure.

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Principles of equity do not

15 apply here?

16             MR. KEDEM:  They don't apply in the same

17 way.  So in City of Sherrill the Court applied a

18 latchestype reasoning.  But latches would not apply to

19 prevent the exercise of authority under a Federal

20 statute, an express delegation of authority under

21 Federal law.

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why not?

23             MR. KEDEM:  Because that's what the Court

24 said, for instance, in the copyright decision that

25 Justice Ginsburg recently wrote, which is that when you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
44 1 have background principles of equity, they are presumed 2 not to be  apply and be displaced when there is a 3 substantive law that Congress passes to deal with the 4 same issue. 5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The law that 6 authorized the imposition of these taxes in the western 7 part of the reservation. 8             MR. KEDEM:  The law authorizes the exercise 9 of this authority if there is a reservation and if the 10 Tribe applies to the Department of the Interior, which 11 has to approve the ordinance. 12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, doesn't that 13 beg the question?  The question was whether or not this 14 reservation has been diminished.  So it's not the 15 reservation. 16             MR. KEDEM:  Well, that's the question with 17 respect to the application of the statute.  But when 18 we're talking about City of Sherrill, we're talking 19 about background equitable principles.  And I'm simply 20 making the point that those principles don't apply when 21 you have an express congressional statute dealing with 22 the same issue. 23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If the City of Sherrill 24 did apply  25             MR. KEDEM:  Pardon?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If the City of Sherrill 2 did apply, hypothetically  I'm not naysaying all the 3 differences you're pointing out  would you lose? 4             MR. KEDEM:  No.  Because again  5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Explain why not. 6             MR. KEDEM:   we're not talking about just 7 what the Tribe can do.  We're also talking about the 8 jurisdiction of the United States as well.  And there's 9 certainly nothing in the City of Sherrill which suggests 10 that the jurisdiction of the United States pursuant to a 11 congressional creation of a reservation can be curtailed 12 by the Tribe's failure to exercise authority in the 13 disputed area. 14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Frankly, I'm more  I'm 15 more inclined to vote your way if the City of Sherrill 16 does apply than if the City of Sherrill doesn't apply. 17 What you're telling me is, unless you get there through 18 Solem, it doesn't matter whether the State and 19 nonIndians have for generations viewed this land as 20 their own.  That's what you're telling me, right? 21             MR. KEDEM:  Well, I'm telling you that to 22 the extent City of Sherrill applies, it applies to a 23 very different question, not the question as to where 24 the borders of the reservation are.  It applies to the 25 question what can the Tribe as a basis of its inherent
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 sovereignty do?  Now, it might under different

46

2 circumstances if the Tribe tried to repurchase a bunch

3 of land 

4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not what city 

5 that's not what Sherrill said.  Sherrill said the Tribe

6 had no jurisdiction.  It said it had no sovereignty over

7 the area anymore.

8             MR. KEDEM:  Again, the diminishment question

9 goes not just to the Tribe's sovereignty but the

10 jurisdiction as well of the United States.

11             And if we're talking about expectations,

12 another point that I would make is that the single best

13 evidence of what these parties could have expected is

14 the retrocession, because that was a unique moment in

15 which the State of Nebraska and the United States talked

16 directly and officially to one another about the burdens

17 and responsibilities for exercising jurisdiction in the

18 reservation.  And the United States in the Federal

19 register, as official as can be, said the entire

20 reservation remains intact.

21             And the State of Nebraska, as we point out

22 in our brief, had exactly the same understanding.  The

23 assistant attorney general for Nebraska came and

24 testified before Congress that all of Thurston County is

25 within the Winnebago and within the Omaha Reservation.

Alderson Reporting Company

47 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That determines the meaning 2 of the 1882 statute. 3             MR. KEDEM:  Not in the least.  It goes to  4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what I think. 5             MR. KEDEM:  I was simply responding to the 6 point that the expectations here might be all in the 7 same direction. 8             I would also point to 30 years of Nebraska 9 revenue rulings, all of which say, point blank, Pender 10 is still part of the reservation.  I would also point to 11 the definition of Thurston County. 12             As my friend pointed out, Pender is the 13 county seat.  I think it's implausible to know that 14 the  to assert that the State of Nebraska wouldn't 15 know that its own law specifies that all of Thurston 16 County is within the reservations of the Omaha and the 17 Winnebagos. 18             I would also like to address, if I could, 19 the tipping point theory that I think emerges from 20 Petitioner's reply brief, and that's the idea that in 21 1872, Congress tried but failed to diminish the 22 reservation because there were only about 300 acres 23 sold.  But in 1882, it succeeded because a lot more land 24 was sold.  I think there are a lot of problems with this 25 theory.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
48 1             First of all, if that was what Congress had 2 in mind, presumably it would have specified some way to 3 know when the tipping point had been reached:  Some 4 percentage of land sales, some other measure of success. 5 There's nothing about that in the text.  There's nothing 6 about that in the legislative history. 7             Second of all, the concept that Congress 8 could attempt but fail to diminish a reservation, as my 9 friend said that it did in 1872, is a concept that is 10 wholly foreign to this Court's jurisprudence, which 11 makes clear that Congress has plenary power. 12             And finally, I think this Court should be 13 very reluctant to assume that Congress implicitly 14 transferred any part of its authority to change the 15 borders of an Indian reservation to private parties and 16 made it contingent on what this Court in Dakota referred 17 to as uncertain future sales. 18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, is that saying 19 there's no such thing as de facto diminishment? 20             MR. KEDEM:  I think that de facto 21 diminishment, if you think of it as some sort of 22 freestanding alternative path to change the boundaries 23 of a reservation, I do agree that it doesn't exist. 24             But if you're talking about it  25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How is that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 consistent with the language in Solem that

49

2 Justice Ginsburg read?

3             MR. KEDEM:  I  I think it's a little bit

4 hard to know exactly what the court meant.

5             This Court has never found de facto

6 diminishment.  All seven of its surplus land cases were

7 decided on the basis of congressional intent.  And then

8 there were sometimes a few sentences thrown in about how

9 the status quo wouldn't change very much.

10             I want to leave you with one more point.

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about Sherrill?

12             MR. KEDEM:  Pardon?

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about Sherrill?

14             MR. KEDEM:  Sherrill is very explicit, but

15 it is not a diminishment ruling.  There's a footnote in

16 City of Sherrill which makes very clear that it is not

17 deciding the diminishment issue or the jurisdiction of

18 the United States.

19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What's  what's

20 vague about the language where nonIndian settlers

21 flooded into the opened portion of a reservation and the

22 area has long since lost its Indian character, we have

23 acknowledged that de facto, if not de jure diminishment

24 may have occurred.

25             MR. KEDEM:  I think you have to read that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
50 1 sentence in light of Yankton Sioux, which says that when 2 you're talking about the subsequent treatment of the 3 area and the pattern of settlement, those are relevant 4 only insofar as they bear on the touchstone of the 5 inquiry, which is congressional intent. 6             If I can make one final  7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I think if you 8 look at the passage, it goes on, then, to discuss in 9 addition to that, then we look to subsequent demographic 10 history as an additional clue as to what Congress meant. 11 I  I read those as the two different paragraphs as 12 making two different points. 13             MR. KEDEM:  I think you could definitely 14 read it that way if you just had Solem.  I think if you 15 read Solem in light of Yankton Sioux, you reach a 16 different result. 17             If I could make one final point about 18 unsettling expectations.  There are more than 300 19 Federallyrecognized Indian reservations all throughout 20 the United States.  The single most unsettling thing 21 that this Court could do would be to suggest that the 22 borders of those reservations depend not on what 23 Congress said about them, but on shifting demographic 24 patterns or who provides what services where. 25             If there are no further questions.

52 1 this was committed by an Indian; this was committed by a 2 nonIndian.  You have a lot of whodoneits in which the 3 question is who's supposed to investigate, and you have 4 this overlapping jurisdiction where law enforcement 5 itself is confused as to who's supposed to be 6 investigating when they don't even know, maybe, who the 7 perpetrator is. 8             The idea that a Tribal member of a State 9 governmental authority is somehow shows  10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  Wouldn't  11 wouldn't the latter be the case with respect to any 12 municipality that's within a reservation?  We've been 13 told there are a lot of those.

It  it  I 21 mean, that exists. 22             What's different in this case is the history 23 is 130 years of people who believe and chose.  And they 24 are not living on an Indian reservation; they are living 25 in the State of Nebraska.  I call the State patrol.  The

It's the justifiable 3 expectations of the people who live there. 4             JUSTICE BREYER:  Their point is, the 5 government says, fine, make that argument.  Make it 6 under the rubric City of Sherrill.  Maybe you make it 7 when you go down on remand or something, but it is 8 workable to divide the issue into two parts. 9             The first issue is what's the reservation, 10 and the second issue is what can you do on the 11 reservation? 12             When you get to question two, if the Tribe 13 has made no assertion of jurisdiction, nobody even knows 14 about it for 150 years.  Maybe it's basically unfair to 15 let them do what they want to do.  And that depends on a 16 lot of factors, such as what Congress says. 17             So what do you think of that argument? 18 Let's leave it for later.  Nobody's argued it. 19             MR.
