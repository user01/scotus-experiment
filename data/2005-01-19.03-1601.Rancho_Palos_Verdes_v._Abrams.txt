3 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in the

4 City of Rancho Palos Verdes against Abrams.

5 Mr. Lamken.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8 MR. LAMKEN: Thank you, Justice Stevens. May it

9 please the Court:

10 This case concerns whether Congress, in enacting

11 section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act, intended to

12 expose local governments and State and local officials to

13 expansive section 1983 liability with the tens of

14 thousands of wireless antenna zoning decisions they must

15 make each year.

16 Entitled preservation of local zoning authority,

17 section 332 provides for State and local agencies in the

18 first instance to implement specific Federal substantive

19 and procedural requirements, together with preserved State

20 zoning laws, in passing on applications to build or modify

21 wireless towers. It then provides a highly distinctive,

22 independent cause of action for accelerated judicial

23 review of the decisions, including a short limitations

24 period and mandatory expedition. That tailored process is

25 sufficiently comprehensive to evidence Congress' intent

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 for enforcement to occur --

2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Mr. Lamken, it's not as

3 comprehensive as other schemes where the Court said, on

4 that basis, we would not find a section 1983 cause of

5 action, is it? I mean, it's -- it's more spare.

6 MR. LAMKEN: It -- it is unusual in its unique

7 focus on private enforcement, but there was a reason for

8 the focus on private enforcement. In other provisions of

9 the Communications Act, the Congress chose -- for example,

10 section 253, Congress chose to eliminate enforcement at --

11 at the FCC level because it was concerned that State and

12 local governments often wouldn't have enough -- excuse me

13 -- local governments in particular --

14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what -- what --

15 MR. LAMKEN: -- wouldn't be able to -- I'm

16 sorry.

17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What would you think of a

18 case where the plaintiff alleges that the antenna zoning

19 was the -- was caused by racial discrimination against the

20 applicant? Would there be a 1983 cause of action, do you

21 suppose?

22 MR. LAMKEN: Yes. That would still be available

23 because the -- the section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) only provides

24 for a cause of action for violations of the Communications

25 Act. Violations of the Constitution continue to be

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 enforceable directly under section 1983.

2 Section -- section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) is

3 comprehensive in the relevant sense in that for every

4 violation of section 332(c)(7), for every person adversely

5 aggrieved, it provides a mechanism for private judicial

6 enforcement. In addition --

7 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what about -- it -- it

8 -- section 332 speaks of an award of all appropriate

9 relief. What does that include? Could it include

10 punitive damages? Could it include attorney's fees, do

11 you think?

12 MR. LAMKEN: In that respect, it is

13 indistinguishable -- for example, the statute that was at

14 issue in Smith v. Robinson, and it doesn't specify the

15 precise forms of relief available. In our view in this

16 case, appropriate relief would mean specific relief, the

17 type of relief that is traditionally given on review of

18 zoning decisions and on review of judicial review of

19 agency action. That's supported by a number of

20 considerations.

21 I should point out, in the first instance, that

22 in this case respondent never did seek damages, or

23 punitive damages for that matter, under section

24 332(c)(7)(B)(v) itself.

25 But that's supported by a number of

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 considerations. 


2 First is the structure of the act, which


3 presents it as a form of judicial review of agency action.

4 The act is structured much as you have -- much as you

5 would when a Federal agency enforces or implements Federal

6 requirements and are subject to judicial review. The only

7 difference is that Congress swapped in, effectively, State

8 and local agencies with the initial implementers in place

9 of the Federal Government. In that respect, it shares

10 some of the characteristics of sections 251 and 252 of the

11 Communications Act which are also implemented by local --

12 by -- excuse me -- by State governments as opposed to the

13 FCC.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. -- Mr. Lamken, the

15 argument has been made that 4 years before the

16 telecommunications act we're talking about was adopted,

17 Congress adopted the Cable TV Consumer Protection Act.

18 And in that act, it specifically limited the remedies to

19 declaratory and injunctive relief. Here we face silence.

20 Isn't that an indication that when Congress wants to limit

21 relief to declaratory and injunctive, it will say so in

22 the -- in the measure?

23 MR. LAMKEN: Justice Ginsburg, that -- that's an

24 example where Congress, for a broad range of statutes that

25 could be potentially used to enforce the Cable Act, chose

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to restrict the forms of relief available. And it is an

2 example, in the words of Sea Clammers, where Congress has

3 made its intent explicit in the text of the statute.

4 Congress can also by implication limit the forms

5 of -- excuse me -- limit the mechanism for relief that's

6 available, and that's our position here, that Congress by

7 providing --

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: What's the -- what's the source

9 of the implication?

10 MR. LAMKEN: Pardon?

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: You say by implication.

12 MR. LAMKEN: The implication -- Congress has

13 provided a specific mechanism for judicial relief here,

14 section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) itself, and that is a highly

15 adapted mechanism which includes unique characteristics

16 such as a very short limitations period.

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so the -- the

18 implication, I -- I guess, is that unless it specifically

19 provides for damages, it implicitly does not.

20 MR. LAMKEN: I'm sorry. In terms of Congress

21 making damages available under 332(c)(7)(B)(v), our view

22 of the damage -- mind you damages are only one of the

23 differences we think that exists here, but our view is

24 supported by a number of considerations, in addition to

25 the structure of the statute. For example, appropriate

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 relief is often -- is the traditional form of relief

2 available. In this context traditional relief was always

3 specific relief. Congress also included a specific

4 savings clause that extends not merely to Federal

5 statutes, but prohibits the impairment --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Where -- where are

7 you getting the term, appropriate relief, from?

8 MR. LAMKEN: This -- that comes from this

9 Court's decision in Franklin, that where Congress doesn't

10 specifically identify the specific forms of relief

11 available --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. But that's --

13 that's not in the -- that's not in the text of this

14 statute, is it?

15 MR. LAMKEN: No, it isn't. It is an inference

16 the Court draws from silence. When the Court -- when

17 Congress provides an express cause of action and does not

18 identify the specific forms of relief available, the Court

19 will infer that Congress intended to provide all

20 appropriate relief. But the term, appropriate relief, is

21 that relief which Congress would have intended, and when

22 the Court is determining that, it takes a look at what the

23 traditional forms of relief are and it will look at things

24 such as the savings clause in 601(c), which expressly says

25 that the statute should not be read, unless it expressly

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 provides, to supersede, impair, or otherwise modify State

2 and local law, as well as Federal law. And in order to

3 put damages into the statute, if it doesn't provide

4 damages expressly, one would have to impair myriad

5 municipal immunity laws that otherwise protect

6 municipalities and State and local officers implementing

7 zoning requirements from liability.

8 Finally, the FCC has --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and 1983 is not subject

10 to that limitation.

11 MR. LAMKEN: Well, 1983 is expressly preemptive

12 under this Court's decisions, and it is -- it would

13 preempt the State laws by its own force. But we believe

14 that that also supports Congress' decision not to provide

15 -- or supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend

16 to provide section 1983 relief here because the effect of

17 making the Communications Act enforceable under section

18 1983 would be to expand the categories of claims for which

19 -- that -- those immunities are unavailable, and it would

20 thereby impair those immunities.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: But are they only immune from

22 damages action or are they immune from suit?

23 MR. LAMKEN: No. They're generally immunities

24 -- immune from damages actions, not from suits.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, I mean, that proves too

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 much because they -- the statute obviously intends to

2 eliminate that immunity. The immunity from suit is -- is

3 clearly --

4 MR. LAMKEN: Oh, I think -- I think you may have

5 misunderstood. The immunity is not from suit. It's an

6 immunity from damages and the impairment would be the

7 immunity from damages. Section 332 is not designed to

8 impair the municipal immunity statutes, and they are not

9 immunities from suit. They are generally from damage

10 liability. The officers are subject to suit because these

11 are subject --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it allows suit against

13 either municipalities or States, State or local

14 governments. Right?

15 MR. LAMKEN: Yes.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the States have immunity

17 not just from damages but from suit.

18 MR. LAMKEN: As a constitutional matter, they

19 have an immunity from suit, but --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless they have chosen to

21 waive it, which --

22 MR. LAMKEN: Right.

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- one must assume in this area

24 they haven't.

25 MR. LAMKEN: Right.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you have to regard this

2 provision as intentionally overriding some provisions of

3 State law in -- inasmuch as they apply to -- to immunity.

4 MR. LAMKEN: Well, first of all, I don't think

5 it would be read to -- to override the State's

6 constitutional immunity to suit.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. That's --

8 MR. LAMKEN: But it would be read to -- it would

9 be read to override immunities to suit that exist under

10 State law because otherwise it couldn't be affected.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: In for a penny, in for a pound.

12 MR. LAMKEN: Right.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: If they've -- if they've

14 waived --

15 MR. LAMKEN: But I'm not --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if you acknowledge that

17 it was intended to affect their immunity from suit, why --

18 why would we suspect that it was not intended to affect

19 their immunity from damages?

20 MR. LAMKEN: Well, because it would be -- it

21 would be a provision with no effect whatsoever if it

22 didn't override immunities to suit.

23 But I'm not sure there are provisions that are

24 providing for -- I mean, that there are myriad damages

25 immunity laws that provide municipalities absolute

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 immunity from suit. It's fairly common, at least under

2 California and other State law, for municipalities to be

3 subject to suit for review of their -- of the actions that

4 they make. And that is the typical fashion that this --

5 this statute simply incorporated that typical fashion of

6 providing judicial review of agency action.

7 Another consideration that supports the view

8 that section 1983 has been displaced is that the act

9 provides an entire process for the implementation of the

10 Federal statutes. It establishes Federal substantive

11 requirements that identifies the agencies to implement

12 them. It provides Federal procedural guarantees, APA-

13 like guarantees, like the requirement of substantial

14 evidence, like the requirement of a written decision, like

15 the requirement of a decision with a reasonable period of

16 time.

17 It then follows up with a mechanism, an adapted

18 mechanism for judicial review. In that sense, it is very

19 much like the statute at issue in Smith v. Robinson.

20 That elaborate process is particularly

21 significant given the pattern of the Communications Act as

22 a whole. The Communications Act repeatedly matches

23 specific regulatory requirements such as, for example, the

24 common carrier requirements in 202 and 203, with

25 corresponding mechanisms for private enforcement, such as

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 an action for suit -- I mean, an action for damages in

2 court or an enforcement action in the commission in

3 sections 206 and 207.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does this action have to be

5 brought in Federal court? It says any court of competent

6 jurisdiction. Could --

7 MR. LAMKEN: Yes. The action can be brought in

8 State court and often is. There are about 50 reported

9 decisions that we have found where the suit has been

10 brought in State court. I haven't seen a particular

11 pattern between the choice, but Congress gave the option.

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would a State court be free to

13 award damages or would that be preempted under the view

14 you take of the statute?

15 MR. LAMKEN: The State -- because there's an

16 express preservation of State law in this context, I think

17 that State -- States would be free to award damages under

18 their own laws. They wouldn't -- whatever relief is

19 available under the Federal statute would be available

20 under the available under the Federal statute, and State

21 courts wouldn't be free to second-guess Congress' judgment

22 as to what relief should be provided under Federal

23 statute.

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the State court allowed

25 damages -- if -- if the State system allowed -- State law

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 allowed damages, would the Federal court, in an action

2 under this section, be allowed to award damages under that

3 -- under the State statute?

4 MR. LAMKEN: Your Honor, I think since the --

5 the provision, the savings clause, says that the statute

6 should not be construed to impair State law -- and there

7 are so many municipal immunity statutes and you would only

8 have one construction of the statute -- I believe that the

9 construction would be an across-the-boards construction,

10 that this act does not provide damages and you would not

11 vary from State to State.

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: What if the State law

13 authorized the recovery of attorney's fees? Would they be

14 recoverable?

15 MR. LAMKEN: Pardon?

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: What if the State law

17 authorized the recovery of attorney's fees?

18 MR. LAMKEN: Well --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: What would you do then?

20 MR. LAMKEN: If the State law provides for

21 recovery of attorney's fees for State violations, then

22 that would control for State violations. For violations

23 of Federal law, the -- the remedies that Congress chose to

24 provide would control and the States would not be

25 permitted to second-guess the -- the remedies --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not sure why that would be

2 if you, in fact, see the statute as trying to impose an

3 APA-like structure, saying to the States, you decide the

4 substance, we'll give you minimum elements of form, which

5 helps your position. Then if the minimum elements of form

6 are not specifically stated in the statute, there's no

7 reason to interfere with the States. Let them do what

8 they want. Only those minimum elements are what you can't

9 do. That works perfectly for you.

10 MR. LAMKEN: Justice Breyer --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: It's strongly supported in the

12 history. It may lose your client the money. I don't

13 know.

14 MR. LAMKEN: Well, in fact, California provides

15 a municipal immunity for permitting decisions, and so my

16 client --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: So then you're only --

18 MR. LAMKEN: -- would be fine with your

19 position. But that is a potential inference. My -- the

20 normal view would be that where Congress provides a -- a

21 statute, one would normally presume that Congress intended

22 a particular set of remedies to accompany it. You could

23 say that the silence is meant to -- meant to reflect the

24 fact that Congress knew that these would be enforced in

25 State courts, as well as Federal, and it would allow State

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 courts --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Congress didn't care.

3 MR. LAMKEN: -- to use whatever --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Congress wanted to substitute a

5 Federal judgment for the judgment of the States where it

6 said so. And the reason you know that is because that is

7 what is consistent with the purpose of the act and other

8 things are either neutral or negative. Don't interfere

9 with the State unless you have to.

10 MR. LAMKEN: That is one of our principal

11 contentions, Justice Breyer, which is --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what, Mr. Lamken, would

13 be the normal procedure in the State? You make an

14 application for a permit to a zoning board. What is the

15 standard operating procedure under State law? Suppose we

16 don't have any telecommunications act in the picture.

17 MR. LAMKEN: The normal procedure is either

18 under a uniform State law or California law. If you have

19 a -- an entity which is -- excuse me. If you have either

20 a planning commission or sometimes there's another entity

21 that does the initial review and makes a determination

22 whether to grant the permit. It is then appealable either

23 to a zoning board of adjustment -- that's the -- the model

24 act -- or in California, States -- localities have the

25 option of having the appeal go to the local legislature.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 That appeal is then reviewed -- is then determined. And

2 finally, once you've gone through that process, under

3 California law it's generally reviewable by a writ of

4 mandate, although other -- other States provide review by

5 writ of certiorari, by mandamus, or by various other

6 procedures, almost always subject to a short limitations

7 period, almost always short -- requiring finality, a final

8 decision, exhaustion through the State process.

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the remedies being

10 injunctive and declaratory.

11 MR. LAMKEN: A -- a form of specific relief.

12 Generally they have the authority to effectively go in and

13 revise the decision below, but the remedies ordinarily do

14 not include monetary or compensatory relief I should say.

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying that it's

16 parallel to what APA review of an agency decision would

17 be?

18 MR. LAMKEN: It's very much like that. The

19 remand rule that this Court normally requires in the APA

20 context is not so strictly observed in the context of --

21 of review of -- judicial review of zoning decisions, but

22 it is very much like APA review. That is what prevails.

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it seems to me that the

24 30-day provision is inconsistent with the award of

25 damages, but after I say that, I can't tell you why.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 (Laughter.) 


2 MR. LAMKEN: Well, actually this Court's


3 decision in Burnett v. Grattan actually tells you why, and

4 that is that 30-day provisions, which are typical for on-

5 the-record review of decisions below, are often

6 insufficient to allow somebody to develop a whole new

7 record such as their proof of damages, to make important

8 decisions if they're going to have, for example, a jury

9 trial, or to prepare for discovery. And that's why 30-

10 day provisions are not entirely uncommon in the area of

11 judicial review of agency action, but they're wholly

12 unprecedented, for the most part that I know of, in the

13 area of tort-like remedies like section 1983.

14 If I -- if there are no further questions, I

15 would like to reserve the remainder of my time for

16 rebuttal.

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, you may.

18 Mr. Feldman.

19 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

20 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

21 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

22 MR. FELDMAN: Justice Stevens, and may it please

23 the Court:

24 Where Congress creates a special cause of action

25 for -- for a violation of a Federal law that necessarily

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 carries with it its own features and incidents, Congress'

2 decisions about the appropriate mechanisms for dealing

3 with that violation of Federal law should not be

4 frustrated or overridden by allowing a 1983 action in

5 addition.

6 In this case, section 332(c)(7)(B)(v), which

7 creates a cause of action for violation of the specific

8 standards in (i) through (iv) is an independent,

9 standalone cause of action. If 1983 didn't exist,

10 332(c)(7)(B)(v) would, undoubtedly, still provide

11 plaintiffs with a mechanism to get into court and attain

12 redress for the legal wrongs that they claim.

13 Where Congress has taken that step and has

14 thought about what the appropriate remedy should be for a

15 violation of a particular Federal statute and has created

16 a judicial remedy, then it would only frustrate --

17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it -- the statute,

18 though, is silent on the question of damages or attorney's

19 fees, isn't it?

20 MR. FELDMAN: It is. It doesn't say anything

21 expressly about either of those things, but I think it has

22 long been --

23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Can we infer all appropriate

24 relief? Do we?

25 MR. FELDMAN: As a matter of damages, I think

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 all appropriate relief would be the standard. But as a

2 matter of attorney's fees, I think is a good example of

3 why there shouldn't be a 1983 action here because the law

4 is 100 percent clear, from this Court's decision in

5 Alyeska and other cases, that where Congress hasn't

6 provided for fee-shifting, there simply is no fee-shifting

7 authorized. That's what they intended.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Attorney's fees are never

9 appropriate, in other words.

10 MR. FELDMAN: Are never appropriate unless

11 Congress specifically provides for them.

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it has provided for them

13 for a 1983 action, and if it's a 1983 action, it takes

14 care of it.

15 MR. FELDMAN: That's right.

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: And this is kind of circular.

17 MR. FELDMAN: I don't think it's circular

18 because I think when Congress created the specific cause

19 of action here in (B)(v), it didn't provide for attorney's

20 fees and therefore intended that attorney's fees not be

21 provided. If respondent's view in this case were

22 accepted, the -- the presumption would be exactly flipped,

23 and Congress would have had --

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feldman --

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose Congress said

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 specifically 1983 applies. That's all it says. Would

2 that carry with it attorney's fees in your view?

3 MR. FELDMAN: Yes, I -- yes, I think it -- I

4 think it would.

5 The question here, though, is where Congress has

6 thought about what kind of remedy it wants for violation

7 of a Federal statute and created a judicial cause of

8 action for every wrong that's -- that -- that can exist

9 under that statute, then the incidents and features of

10 that cause of action should govern, not the incidents and

11 features of 1983 which almost inevitably and in this case

12 are different. And attorney's fees is just the best

13 example of that.

14 If -- under respondent's view -- when Congress

15 was fashioning this statute, it certainly was aware of

16 this Court's decisions that have repeatedly said that

17 attorney's fees are not available unless they're expressly

18 provided for. And indeed, elsewhere in the Communications

19 Act --

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I take -- you -- you

21 take the position that 1983 doesn't apply at all. It's

22 not just attorney's fees. It's damages.

23 MR. FELDMAN: That's right. But it's just an

24 illustration. There's other differences between the

25 provision here and 1983, but I think the basic point is

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that where Congress has given thought to the remedy for a

2 particular violation -- type of violation of Federal law

3 and has provided for a judicial cause of action, with

4 whatever features and incidents it -- it wants, 1983

5 shouldn't be allowed in. It should be assumed that

6 Congress didn't want to have its decisions frustrated by

7 also allowing a 1983 action.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about damages?

9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you -- do you think that

10 any other provisions of the Communications Act are

11 enforceable under 1983? I mean, we're talking about 332,

12 but it's a big, complicated act. Are any of the other

13 provisions enforceable?

14 MR. FELDMAN: I think -- I think the same rule

15 would apply to any of the provisions where Congress has

16 specifically provided for a cause of action for the same

17 reason, otherwise Congress when -- here, for example, just

18 to return to attorney's fees for a second. When Congress

19 was framing this legislation, they knew that they weren't

20 giving attorney's fees and this 332(c)(7)(B)(v) would be

21 construed not to give attorney's fees, but not --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this is really a more

23 general proposition you're urging upon us then, that

24 whenever Congress creates a cause of action that is --

25 what -- in any respect more limited than section 1983, the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 background action of section 1983 is not available.

2 MR. FELDMAN: That -- I -- I think that's

3 correct.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: No. How could that be?

5 Wouldn't it depend on whether -- when you look at the

6 particular statute, the particular set of remedies that

7 Congress has included in that statute could be absolutely

8 independent of 1983 or dependent upon 1983 or leaning in

9 favor or leaning against. It would depend on the

10 particular statute. Why in general?

11 MR. FELDMAN: I think in -- I think the rule

12 would be in general because, first of all, it's not just

13 remedies. There's other incidents of a cause of action

14 such as statute of limitations, the provision here for

15 expedition, and other things. And really when Congress

16 has given thought to what remedy it wants for a violation

17 here of (i) through (iv), for a violation elsewhere in the

18 Communications Act of other Federal standards, it

19 shouldn't be assumed that they all -- that -- to allow a

20 1983 action would just frustrate Congress' intent in

21 fashioning that particular remedy.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how would you ever have

23 a statute that -- 1983 provides for relief when there's a

24 violation of Federal law, statutory or constitutional.

25 One of the briefs in this very case says that your broad

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 reading means that you were doing away with statute as a

2 basis for 1983.

3 MR. FELDMAN: I -- I think that that's

4 completely wrong. When Congress has created -- has

5 recognized a right, as this Court has found is essential

6 for a 1983 action, and it hasn't done anything about

7 providing a remedy for that right, hasn't created a cause

8 of action in court in particular, then that's the function

9 of 1983, is to serve -- it provides a cause of action for

10 people who suffer a violation of that wrong, a statutory

11 violation.

12 But where Congress has given thought to what

13 kind of a relief it wanted and it said we want a cause of

14 action with these such-and-such incidents, no attorney's

15 fees, 30-day statute of limitations, expedition, whatever

16 the other ones are here, then it would just frustrate

17 Congress' intent to say, oh, and also you get a 1983

18 action to undo all of the things that Congress provided

19 for.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there -- there are two

21 situations. I mean, one can supplement without

22 frustrating. I mean, you -- you could say that in, you

23 know -- in some respects the 1983 will contradict the

24 action that was provided, but one can conceive of a

25 provided action that -- that grants relief which 1983

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 would not grant.

2 MR. FELDMAN: That's right. And -- and I --

3 whatever -- I guess the general point would be whatever

4 remedial decisions Congress made, those should be

5 respected, but I would add in this case it's not just --

6 it's a question of attorney's fees, which they would have

7 had to -- Congress would have had to do something very

8 unusual here, which is particularly put in this statute no

9 -- there shall be no fee-shifting because otherwise you

10 can always go to 1983 and get it. In fact, even if they

11 had done that in 332(c)(7)(B)(v), respondents would still

12 argue, well, we still have our 1983 action.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what about damages? Do

14 -- do you take any position on whether the Communications

15 Act provision enables damages to be collected?

16 MR. FELDMAN: We don't have a position on

17 whether it does. I think there's arguments both ways. I

18 would point out --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think it's unnecessary to

20 decide this case.

21 MR. FELDMAN: I think it is unnecessary, and in

22 fact, I think it shows a problem with -- a reason why our

23 view, which is if Congress creates a cause of action, that

24 should be respected -- why that should be respected.

25 Under other views, you have to look at the 1983

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 action and figure out all of its incidents. You have to

2 look at the 332 action and figure out all of its incidents

3 in the abstract as here, not where -- in connection with a

4 particular claim for damages, and then see whether they're

5 consistent with each other.

6 I think the much better rule would be to say

7 where Congress has created a specific cause of action,

8 that's what it wanted, and whatever you get under that,

9 you get. Whatever you don't get under that, you don't

10 get. But 1983 shouldn't be used to -- to frustrate

11 Congress' intent and give you things that that cause of

12 action wouldn't to give you a longer statute of

13 limitations, which would be, I think, the case here, to

14 give you -- eliminate the provision for mandatory

15 expedition, to have any differences in damages.

16 Another way to put it would be under the Court's

17 decision in Franklin, this statute gives you any

18 appropriate relief. All that 1983 could do here -- it

19 maybe gives you the same thing in which, as far as that

20 goes, it doesn't matter. But all it could do otherwise

21 would be give you inappropriate relief, i.e., relief that

22 Congress didn't want.

23 And instead of construing the two statutes in

24 that way, they should be construed harmoniously and in

25 accord with this Court's decisions which have set forth

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the line of cases where you have a right to get into court

2 in Wilder -- I'm sorry -- in -- in Sea Clammers and Smith

3 against Robinson and said there we want to take Congress'

4 remedy, however simple or complex it is. It gives you a

5 complete right to get into court and gives you whatever it

6 gives you. And that should govern.

7 And then the other line of cases, which is

8 Wilder where -- and -- where it says -- and the Wright

9 against Roanoke where Congress didn't give you a right to

10 get to court -- get into court. In those cases, that's

11 the function of 1983.

12 The same thing would be true in -- in a number

13 of other this Court's cases that have recognized you have

14 a 1983 action when Congress gave you a right and didn't

15 think at all about the remedy because that's the function

16 that 1983 was supposed to serve.

17 If there's no further questions.

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Feldman.

19 Mr. Waxman.

20 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

21 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22 MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it

23 please the Court:

24 In -- by its clear text, section 1983 promises

25 redress for the depravation of any Federal right in any,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 quote, proper proceeding. And that expansive language,

2 this Court has recognized, dictates a heavy presumption

3 that its remedies apply to all violations of Federal

4 rights, a presumption which this Court has said is

5 rebutted only in the, quote, exceptional case in which the

6 statute that creates the right is accompanied by an

7 enforcement scheme that is, quote, incompatible with or

8 inconsistent with 1983's remedies. That's --

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Waxman.

10 MR. WAXMAN: -- the background principle.

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Waxman, it seems to me that

12 the -- the best argument we've heard about incompatibility

13 is the one -- or at least I think the best -- is the one

14 that Mr. Lamken touched on at the tail end of his

15 argument, and that is, he said there's -- there's a 30-

16 day provision in there, which in effect says Congress

17 wants this litigation conducted fast and over with fast.

18 And that is incompatible with a damage action because if

19 you get into a damage action, you are going to get into

20 the panoply of -- of damages litigation, including

21 depositions, and -- and the one thing you can guarantee is

22 that it is not going to be over expeditiously.

23 What is your argument? What is your response to

24 that incompatibility argument?

25 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think that the way this

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Court has interpreted incompatibility before -- in the two

2 instances in 25 years since Maine v. Thiboutot was

3 decided, the only instances in which this Court has found

4 incompatibility has been where use of 1983 would create an

5 end run around limitations in the statute. That is, in

6 the -- in Sea Clammers and in Smith v. Robinson, you had

7 statutes that forestalled an individual's access to court

8 via an administrative regime and then expressly limited

9 the judicial remedies that would be available once they

10 got there by requiring, for example, only injunctive

11 relief.

12 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the other word is

13 inconsistent, and is it -- sorry. Were you -- is it

14 inconsistent if Congress didn't want it? And if that's

15 insufficient to be inconsistent, then here, as I look at

16 the statute, to get out my thinking, I think that it

17 sounds like an administrative law statute. If I saw the

18 maintenance and cure words, I'd think it was an admiralty

19 statute.

20 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: I see an administrative law

22 statute. It sounds like that's the system they're

23 imposing and therefore a system that is not consistent

24 with the administrative law system fails and 1983 seems to

25 fail.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. Now I have two points. I --

2 I don't want to forget these. I have to deal with the --

3 the question of whether a 30-day requirement is

4 inconsistent and whether damages would be inconsistent

5 with what -- with what my colleagues posit as an APA-like

6 administrative review model.

7 A 30-day requirement is simply a reflection of

8 Congress' -- Congress confirming expressly that somebody

9 who -- who is aggrieved under the rights provided to him

10 under 332(c)(7) and wants any judicial remedy, whether

11 it's from 1983 or otherwise, has to go to court promptly.

12 It's precisely what 1983, this Court said in Patsy and

13 Felder, guarantees and requires. It does not require --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it also requires

15 expeditiousness on the part of the court.

16 MR. WAXMAN: It requires that the court proceed

17 expeditiously and courts can proceed expeditiously where

18 damages are sought or are not sought.

19 One of the interesting things about damages --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: But do you -- do you agree with

21 this much, that if -- if damages, in fact, are going to be

22 allowed, what is going to count as expeditious is going to

23 be a lot slower than what is going to count as expeditious

24 if damages are not allowed.

25 MR. WAXMAN: I don't think that's true. In

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 fact, I think this case is a pretty good example. The

2 court separated it -- I mean, acting under a requirement

3 of expedition at the request of the city. This -- the

4 court didn't even begin to address this case until 18

5 months after it had been filed. But what it said was --

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. And -- and that --

7 MR. WAXMAN: -- the first issue --

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that was a violation of the

9 statute, wasn't it?

10 MR. WAXMAN: Well, it first issued an order

11 saying, okay, I've construed the statute and I've

12 determined that the statute is violated. Now we will have

13 a separate proceeding. Then the city will conduct itself

14 accordingly. Now we'll have a separate proceeding in

15 order to determine whether damages or attorney's fees are

16 available. And that is available in any of these cases.

17 What --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: So they turned the damage issue

19 basically just into a separate remedial hearing at the end

20 of the case.

21 MR. WAXMAN: It could or could not be, and there

22 may -- may be many cases when damages aren't appropriate

23 but --

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that was just to

25 decide in -- in the -- in the court of first instance --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that tail end was not to decide whether in this specific

2 case damages or attorney's fees were due. But the

3 district court was deciding a question of law, that is,

4 whether in this kind of review proceeding anyone could

5 have damages, anyone could have attorney's fees.

6 MR. WAXMAN: What he said, Justice Ginsburg, was

7 we'll deal with what other remedies, if any, are available

8 and to what extent in a separate proceeding. As it turns

9 out, he concluded in an --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But was not making a rule for

11 this case only. He was making a ruling of law.

12 MR. WAXMAN: For sure. He said that I don't

13 think you're entitled to this because I think that the

14 statute doesn't allow it. And therefore, he didn't get to

15 this question.

16 But the point about damages -- I think there are

17 two points that are very important that not be obscured.

18 First of all, the Government -- the fact that

19 the Government and the petitioner can't agree on whether

20 the statute itself provides damages relief under the

21 principle of Bell v. Hood and Franklin v. Gwinnett County

22 certainly shows that Congress did not speak expressly on

23 this subject.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they don't necessarily

25 disagree. The Government just says the -- the issue

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 doesn't have to be reached in this case.

2 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think -- I think that --

3 what the Government says in its papers is they may well be

4 available and what Mr. Feldman -- I don't want to misquote

5 him, but he said that under Franklin -- he agreed, I

6 think, with what Judge Posner wrote for the Seventh

7 Circuit, which is where no remedies -- where no specific

8 remedies are specified -- and that's the case here -- you

9 apply a rule of judicial implication, announced in Bell v.

10 Hood and applied to an implied right of action in

11 Franklin, to apply that all appropriate relief is

12 available. And damages are the paradigm.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman.

14 MR. WAXMAN: And the irony here --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, how do you -- how

16 do you get a reading of the 30-day limitation, which is

17 applicable to the cause of action under the Communications

18 Act, sucked into the cause of action under section 1983?

19 I mean, if the suit is under 1983, it's under 1983.

20 There's no 30-day limit there.

21 MR. WAXMAN: I have -- I have two different ways

22 to get to that.

23 First of all, section 1983, by its terms,

24 provides redress in any appropriate cause of action. It

25 also supplies a cause of action where no other cause of

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 action is available, but by its express terms, it doesn't

2 exclusively limit its remedies to causes of action that

3 are brought under 1983.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, it doesn't.

5 MR. WAXMAN: But more broadly --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't require you to --

7 to establish a cause of action under some other statute

8 either.

9 MR. WAXMAN: That's right. It provides a --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: It does not at all. It's --

11 it's self-contained. And do you know any case where we

12 have read into, or indeed, it's even been urged upon us to

13 read into, section 1983 limitations that somehow come from

14 the statute that was violated and which forms the basis

15 for the 1983 action?

16 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I don't, but I do know that

17 this Court -- first of all, Congress has now enacted

18 section 1658 which provides a -- a 4-year Federal default

19 statute of limitations, where -- where a statute like 1983

20 doesn't provide it, but includes an -- an introduction

21 that says, except where otherwise provided by Federal law.

22 And there's certainly nothing in that language that says

23 when you're looking at whether a statute of limitations is

24 otherwise provided by Federal law, you look to the very

25 statute that creates the substantive right that 1983 is

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 enforcing.

2 And even before that, when your -- your decision

3 in Wilson v. Garcia made the point that when you try to

4 figure out what statute of limitations applies to a

5 freestanding 1983 action, there are -- there is a

6 tripartite rule of construction that section 1988 requires

7 you to engage in. And the first part is to see whether

8 there is any, quote, suitable Federal statute of

9 limitations.

10 Now, in constitutional cases, like the one that

11 was at issue in Wilson v. Garcia or under the Social

12 Security Act, which is what was addressed in Maine v.

13 Thiboutot, there were no express causes of action, much

14 less any express statute of limitations. And so this

15 Court said you then go to the second rule, which is what's

16 the most appropriate State limitations, as 1988 requires.

17 But the anomaly of the argument here is we have

18 a background principle that 1983 is available and there is

19 a heavy presumption that it will be available unless it is

20 explicitly incompatible or inconsistent with --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's --

22 MR. WAXMAN: -- and --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: -- that's why I'm approaching

24 it differently, and I -- I want to get your view on it.

25 I'm taking the word inconsistent and I'm using that as a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 guide back into the purpose of the statute. And once I do

2 that, I find Congress here anxious, I think, to engage in

3 what I'd call cooperative federalism. They could have run

4 the whole show, but they said we don't want the FCC. We

5 want each city and town to do what they want, subject to a

6 few minimal procedural requirements.

7 If that's right, that means all these damages

8 questions are open. All kinds of things are open, but --

9 and we'll decide them in a variety of ways, maybe

10 deferring to the State, but one thing is true: 1983

11 doesn't apply because that is a different set of remedies.

12 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, this is not the APA

13 model. This is not a model of administrative review for a

14 number of reasons.

15 Number one, it is a background -- there -- there

16 -- it is established, for purposes of this case, that this

17 statute creates individual Federal rights and those rights

18 were violated. And the background rule is uniformly --

19 and this Court has -- has -- in Owens v. City of

20 Indianapolis and many other cases has reinforced the

21 principle that damages are available and 1983 is available

22 where Federal rights are violated by municipalities,

23 whether it's under the Takings Clause or the Due Process

24 Clause or the Equal Protection Clause or in statutory

25 cases. What is more --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman -- Mr. Waxman, one

2 of these provisions gives you an option to go to the FCC,

3 the one having to do with emissions. Now, if you sought

4 review from the local decision to the FCC, you petition

5 for FCC relief, would the FCC have authority to give you

6 attorney's fees?

7 MR. WAXMAN: The FCC has said that it does not

8 if you do that. In -- in 2000, when the FCC last

9 reported, one person had chosen to go that route rather

10 than go to Federal court. It --

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, isn't that an

12 incongruity that Congress would say you have your choice?

13 Complainant, you can go to the Federal agency, the FCC, or

14 you can go to court.

15 MR. WAXMAN: You can't go to the -- excuse me.

16 I didn't --

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if -- if you have that

18 choice, when you're dealing with the radio emissions, to

19 go the -- why would any litigant ever do that? Why would

20 any attorney ever do that if you don't get fees at the FCC

21 and you do get fees in court? Wouldn't the presumption be

22 that it would work the same way whether you go to the

23 agency, Federal agency, or Federal or State court, that

24 you're in the same situation as respect to fees?

25 MR. WAXMAN: The -- the FCC alternative for a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 declaration by the FCC applies to only one of the five

2 rights that are provided here, and even if it applied to

3 all of them, I don't think you could possibly infer

4 that --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take the one,

6 that -- that one. Are you saying no attorney's fees there

7 because you couldn't get them at the FCC, therefore you

8 shouldn't get them in court?

9 MR. WAXMAN: Absolutely not. If -- if there

10 were an instance in which a local zoning official said,

11 you know, I know I'm not supposed to take radio

12 frequencies emissions into account, but I'm going to, it's

13 denied, I would have the right either to go to the FCC and

14 say, tell them no, or to file an action under 332 and/or

15 1983 and say that violates my rights. And actually your

16 example --

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't --

18 MR. WAXMAN: If I just may finish.

19 Your example, I think -- the example of this

20 particular provision points out that what -- the balance

21 of what I was going to explain to Justice Breyer, which is

22 that another reason why this isn't the APA model is that

23 this statute includes in little (i) and little (ii)

24 substantive provisions, not just procedural provisions.

25 You can't discriminate, to give Justice O'Connor's first

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 example, among providers. The -- that was a complaint in

2 this case. There is de novo review, it is clear, on those

3 claims. It's not administrative APA review in any

4 respect. And in fact, the district judge in this very

5 case, Judge Wilson, says it looks like, in fact, you were

6 discriminated against, but I don't need to reach that

7 because it's clear that there was no substantial evidence.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they didn't provide for

9 the normal administrative review because they were quite

10 aware that under the State zoning systems, there would

11 always be State administrative review before the issue

12 even comes up.

13 MR. WAXMAN: And this --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: And so what this provides is

15 what kind of judicial review there will be after the

16 anticipated administrative review before the zoning board

17 and whatever appeal from the zoning board exists.

18 MR. WAXMAN: I -- I have to respectfully

19 disagree. This Court, in -- in Williamson County and

20 Darby and many other cases, has distinguished carefully

21 between final -- final action and exhaustion of

22 administrative review or judicial review. And all this

23 statute requires is that if you are aggrieved by an action

24 or inaction of a State or local government or an

25 instrumentality thereof --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Final. Final action or failure

2 to act is what --

3 MR. WAXMAN: That's correct.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Final action or failure to.

5 MR. WAXMAN: And final action, this Court has

6 explained, does not import into it exhaustion of either a

7 State administrative or judicial remedies. What it means

8 is that once you have been injured, it's a -- it's a

9 ripeness requirement that's familiar under --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: You haven't been injured until

11 you've exhausted your --

12 MR. WAXMAN: That is --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you really think that

14 when there is a State provision available for review of

15 the zoning board, you can commence an action under 1983

16 without even going through the administrative appeals?

17 MR. WAXMAN: I am entirely certain of that, and

18 in fact, the -- the local ordinance -- I mean, the

19 question of what is final agency action is surely a

20 Federal question, but --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is really respecting the

22 States, which is what the -- the purpose of this -- of

23 this whole provision was.

24 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, when Congress

25 addressed this problem in 1996, as the Government points

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 out in the very first page of its brief and as the

2 legislative history reflects, it was confronting a

3 situation in which intransigent, entrenched zoning

4 authorities were acting arbitrarily to frustrate the

5 creation of a national wireless network. And it was so

6 concerned about this that the House actually passed a

7 provision that removed this paradigmatic local authority

8 to the FCC. The FCC was --

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Which would be more

10 burdensome? That enactment or subjecting municipalities

11 nationwide to damages? Which would be more intrusive and

12 burdensome on federalism --

13 MR. WAXMAN: I think --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and the abilities of local

15 governments to function?

16 MR. WAXMAN: Oh, I think the former, for sure.

17 I mean, the notion that zoning decisions, siting decisions

18 would be removed entirely from localities is unbelievably

19 intrusive.

20 And what happened in the conference committee

21 was a compromise was reached whereby Congress' objective

22 was going to be achieved by creating -- by leaving it, in

23 the first instance, Justice Kennedy, to local --

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm not so sure

25 because you're arguing that even the smallest municipality

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 can be liable for hundreds of thousands of dollars of

2 attorney's fees.

3 MR. WAXMAN: Well --

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I --

5 MR. WAXMAN: -- let me just say this, with

6 respect to the --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Plus other -- plus other

8 damages.

9 MR. WAXMAN: I think this case, Justice Kennedy

10 -- I have three things to say about this.

11 Just this case is every bit as -- as paradigmatic

12 as the parade of horribles that they suggest. And here's

13 my proof. It has been since 1997 that courts have been

14 ruling that 1983 and damages are available under this

15 statute. There is no evidence in any of the briefs on the

16 other side or any of their amici that there has either

17 been a flood of litigation or inappropriately large

18 awards.

19 And if that happened, Congress would do -- would

20 be attentive to it in the way that Justice Ginsburg

21 pointed out when the local cable authorities came to --

22 came to the very same committees 4 years before and said,

23 we're being hit -- there's an express right of action in

24 555 of the -- the Communications Act. We're being hit

25 with very large 1983 awards. Please do something about

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it. And the very same committees 4 years before enacted a

2 provision that said you may get only injunctive and

3 declaratory relief, thereby creating an incompatibility

4 with 1983, as the legislative history expressly provides.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, cable -- cable media

6 companies may -- may have Congress' ear more readily than

7 -- than -- you know, than the municipality of whatever

8 this is or any --

9 MR. WAXMAN: State and -- than State and local

10 governments? I hope not. But here's -- here's the

11 additional --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: But I -- I wouldn't put a lot

13 of money on it.

14 (Laughter.)

15 MR. WAXMAN: The point is that Congress --

16 Justice Kennedy, the point is not that Congress was being

17 inattentive to State and local budgets. What it wanted to

18 do what was this -- the point this Court the addressed in

19 -- in Stakura and -- and Owens v. City of Indianapolis,

20 which is to enforce a Federal statute through privately

21 enforceable Federal rights, which would include a damages

22 remedy that both provides a deterrent against conduct that

23 had provided entrenched resistance to a Federal program

24 and provide compensation where reasonable and appropriate.

25 Now, this Court has made clear, with respect to

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 damages, in -- in Carey v. Piphus and other cases, that

2 there may be very many cases in which there's a violation

3 of a procedural right but only nominal damages are

4 available. And in Buckhannon --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But with respect to --

6 MR. WAXMAN: If I may just finish this sentence.

7 And in Buckhannon and Farrar v. Hobby, this Court has --

8 has recognized that in order to get attorney's fees, you

9 have to have substantially prevailed and a court, under

10 1988(b), may award attorney's fees in its -- may award --

11 in its discretion insofar as they are reasonable. And --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. -- Mr. Waxman.

13 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is in this legislative

15 record a concern expressed by a Senator from California

16 when there was a proposal on the table to make the FCC the

17 Federal review forum. And that was rejected, if I

18 understand correctly, because there was a concern that

19 municipalities would have to travel all the way to

20 Washington, D.C. to defend in the FCC's forum. And

21 Congress did not want to saddle municipalities with the

22 cost of transporting their representative to D.C. Well,

23 that cost would pale compared to attorney's fees that

24 would be awarded.

25 MR. WAXMAN: First of all, Justice Ginsburg, I

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- the reference to those two Senators -- what those two

2 Senators were talking about is not, as my colleague's

3 brief suggests, this provision. They were talking about

4 another provision of the Telecom Act. I think it was

5 section 253, but I may be wrong.

6 But even if that's the case, the fact of the

7 matter is that whether it was going to cost them -- I

8 agree. It would cost -- look, a regime in -- which left

9 all of these siting decisions to the FCC is breathtaking,

10 and it certainly would impose lots of costs not only on

11 local municipalities to have to come to Washington to

12 justify these decisions, but certainly on the FCC, which

13 would have to send an army out to example -- I mean, it

14 would sort of like be the -- the television commercial,

15 you know, where the guy is walking around saying, you

16 know, can you hear me now, can you hear me now? The fact

17 is it made great sense to continue to leave the initial

18 decisions with local authorities.

19 But Congress had -- was frustrated, expressly

20 frustrated with the fact that the prior regime, in which

21 they had let local authorities do it under their normal

22 routines and applying the normal remedies, was not getting

23 the job done. That was the imperative of this statute.

24 And in the -- in the absence of any evidence, even now 11

25 years later -- or I guess it's 10 years -- 9 years later.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 In the absence of any evidence of a flood of litigation or

2 inappropriate awards, I think given the very heavy

3 presumption that this Court has recognized over and over

4 and over again, that 1983 is there.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: That isn't the only --

6 MR. WAXMAN: 1983 is the background principle

7 against which Congress legislates. And this statute

8 either -- neither provides nor excludes any remedies, and

9 all it does is confirm that when you go -- when you are

10 injured, you can go to court. And --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: The other -- the other harm is

12 there any evidence of because it's -- it would also be

13 harmful if local zoning boards, when faced with quite

14 difficult decisions, because the -- the antenna -- they

15 bristle up and you put them in the wrong place. They're

16 environmentally harmful. They -- there are a lot of bad

17 things, as well as good things about them. And of course,

18 it would be a bad impact if we discovered that the zoning

19 boards were erring too much on the side of granting

20 everybody's application, as well as too much on the side

21 of not granting them.

22 MR. WAXMAN: To be sure.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: And so I -- I don't know how --

24 what the -- there won't be evidence. How can we get

25 evidence on such a thing?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. WAXMAN: The -- the -- you -- the evidence

2 will be either in the decided cases or by local municipal

3 governments coming to Congress and saying, this is too

4 heavy a thumb on the scale. But what we know is that if

5 you afford only prospective relief, which is the -- the

6 ancien regime that Congress was -- that Congress felt

7 wasn't doing the job, it provides no deterrent, no

8 incentive to accomplish what Congress said was --

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- I don't think we --

10 MR. WAXMAN: -- a compelling national objective.

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't think we usually think

12 of -- of judicial review of agency decisions in the

13 ordinary course as being a deterrent.

14 MR. WAXMAN: We --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's an opportunity to

16 elaborate reasons. It's a safeguard. It's not a

17 deterrent. And you're saying it has to be a deterrent.

18 And as Justice Breyer indicates, it -- it means that

19 there's -- there's another voice in that -- in that

20 administrative hearing room. They're terrified of

21 damages.

22 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Kennedy --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's going to skew the

24 decisions.

25 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Kennedy, it -- under their

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- under the regulations of this municipality, which is --

2 is perfectly representative, it is final agency action

3 when the city planning commissioner says no, unless you

4 choose to appeal it to the city council.

5 And there is -- not only is there nothing

6 peculiar about applying 1983 damages awards to the

7 violation by a State and local government of an express

8 Federal right, assuming you can prove not only that the

9 right was violated but also that you were really damaged.

10 It's -- I'm not suggesting that -- that Congress had

11 damages in mind specifically and only to deter conduct.

12 You have said in a variety of instances -- I mentioned

13 Stacura in particular -- that 1983 damages do serve as a

14 deterrent to violation of Federal rights by municipal

15 local officials.

16 But what Congress had -- Congress had to come up

17 with some way to confront this problem in which there were

18 sort of local parochial --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, Mr.

20 Waxman? I don't know if it's really a legal question

21 exactly, but I have the impression that most of the

22 plaintiffs in this type of litigation are well-financed,

23 large companies rather than the typical 1983 plaintiff.

24 And therefore, you don't need the attorney's fee incentive

25 to be sure these rights are protected. Is that a correct

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 impression or is it incorrect?

2 MR. WAXMAN: I -- I don't know whether it's a

3 correct impression or not. Our brief points the Court to

4 an authority that at least 9,500 of the entities that have

5 -- have created antennas or tower facilities have 10 or

6 fewer facilities.

7 And one thing we know for sure is that when

8 Congress enacted the Telecom Act of 1996, it specifically

9 wanted to encourage small operations, start-up companies.

10 It had specific provisions in the law to give special

11 treatment to small entrepreneurs in order to foster

12 diversity and competition. But in the event that you --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I can't imagine -- I can't

14 imagine, Mr. Waxman, that Congress wanted to impose

15 damages plus attorney's fees upon municipalities without

16 even giving the municipalities the chance to correct their

17 mistakes, which is what you're saying.

18 MR. WAXMAN: Well --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying the

20 municipalities' appeal system, which is there for people

21 to take advantage of, is just washed out. One mistake at

22 the lowest level and you get damages and you get

23 attorney's fees. That -- that is extraordinary.

24 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, the -- the -- 1983

25 -- and your jurisprudence shouts this as clearly as it

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 does any other principle -- stands for the proposition

2 that it's there unless, in the explicit language of the

3 statute that creates the right, there is a demonstrated

4 incompatibility. And that's the background rule.

5 There are many instances in the Telecom Act and

6 elsewhere in which Congress has said you can only get

7 injunctive relief. You may not get 1983 damages. I mean,

8 go back to Adickes v. Kress where this Court said in title

9 II of the Public Accommodations Act, Congress expressly --

10 expressly precluded damages in order to avoid invocation

11 of 1983.

12 And I'm not saying that Congress had in mind my

13 client, who is an individual, a sole entrepreneur, who was

14 subject to, I think what the record shows is, prolonged

15 and entrenched intransigence by this particular

16 municipality, any more than it had Judge Posner's example

17 in the Seventh Circuit where it was, you know, Verizon v.

18 the Village of Mequon.

19 But this Court has recognized, as have the lower

20 courts, that you only get damages if you prove that you

21 really have been damaged. And in an instance where

22 there's some procedural violation and a remand to correct

23 it, this may very well be the instance of Carey v. Piphus,

24 where the damages are purely nominal. The agency is given

25 the opportunity.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 In this case, the city never said, give us the

2 opportunity to go back and correct it. And Judge Wilson,

3 a very level-headed district judge, said there's nothing

4 to go back and correct because the only thing -- the only

5 reason that the city gave was it didn't like this antenna

6 and tower in the first place. It -- we concede that it

7 makes no difference to anybody which frequencies are being

8 broadcast from this tower that we approved 10 years ago

9 and have no right to modify. And therefore, there was a

10 substantive violation, not just, you know, you -- you may

11 have had substantial evidence but you didn't lay it all

12 out or you gave your reasons at length and orally but not

13 in writing, I'll give you the opportunity to go back.

14 There's a line of cases this Court has decided

15 under the Social Security Act where there have been

16 remands to correct procedural errors or small errors, and

17 in those instances, Carey v. Piphus says you don't get

18 damages. And under Buckhannon and Farrar v. Hobby, you

19 probably don't get attorney's fees either.

20 If there ever is the sort of parade of horribles

21 that they protest about, even a small parade of horribles,

22 Congress will be as attentive as it was in 1992 when the

23 cable --

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Lamken, you have about 4

2 minutes left.

3 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

4 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

5 MR. LAMKEN: I'd like to make only two brief

6 points.

7 First, that the imposition of the -- of damages

8 and fees under section 1983 from a decision in this Court

9 for even good faith mistakes in the implementation of the

10 antenna siting rules, which are often complex and

11 uncertain, would be a welcome mat for extensive and

12 aggressive litigation and the imposition of extensive fees

13 on municipalities which simply cannot afford to enforce

14 their zoning rules, the rules that Congress expressly

15 attempted to preserve in the statute itself.

16 It is -- in this case alone, for example,

17 respondent's most recent estimate of his damages and fees

18 -- and this was before he retained Mr. Waxman, I might add

19 -- is -- is $15 million, essentially the city's entire

20 budget for a year. And respondent claims to be a

21 relatively small operator. That sort of -- with that sort

22 of liability in an uncertain area of law, very few

23 municipalities could ever afford to stand on their rights

24 to enforce local zoning even when they're relatively

25 certain that they are right.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Section 332(c)(7) is entitled and has one of its

2 purposes as the preservation of local authority. It

3 should not be construed to provide for that authority's

4 evisceration.

5 The second point I wanted to hit is that when

6 Congress established the mechanism for review in 332, it

7 provided a very adapted mechanism with an unusual pair of

8 characteristics: a very short limitations period and

9 mandatory expedition. This Court's decisions in Novotny

10 makes it clear that neither of those requirements can be

11 simply transferred over to section 1983. Novotny had very

12 similar language, a 90-day limitations period. The Court

13 did not transfer that over to section 1983. Instead it

14 understood that the general rule, the general Federal

15 principle of law, that in the absence of an express

16 limitations period, that State law would control. Wilson

17 then confirms that rule, as an interpretation of section

18 1988, that the governing Federal principle is that State

19 law controls unless there's an express Federal cause of --

20 statute that addresses that particular cause of action.

21 If there are no further questions, we ask only

22 that the judgment of the Ninth Circuit be reversed. Thank

23 you.

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Lamken.
