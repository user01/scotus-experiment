    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As of this morning, it is exactly 70 years ago to the day, minus 4 months, that this Court heard argument challenging the new Federal Declaratory Judgment Act of 1934, in an action to construe an insurance contract. And exactly 25 years -- 25 days later, in a unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice Hughes, joined by Justices Stone, Brandeis, and others, the Act was held fully consistent with Article III of the Constitution. This morning, you are here because an action was brought for a declaratory judgment that a biomedical manufacturer need not play -- pay large sums, under a license as patent royalties, under a patent it contends is invalid, unenforceable, and not infringed, but is paying royalties under protest in the meantime. That complaint was ordered dismissed by the Federal Circuit as outside the Article III judicial power of the United States. In detail, the Petitioner, MedImmune, is a biotech company, formed in 1988. During the 1990s --"

    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, but as a matter of policy, we, at some point, either in this case or some later case, may have to address the question of whether or not such a provision is enforceable. If it is, we may be -- not be talking about much. It's just going to be boilerplate in every license agreement, and that's the end of it. And it --"
  },

    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "And so --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",

    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "And those reasons, I would suggest, Justice Kennedy, were taken care of in Lear, for the most part, in 1969. Provisions in license contracts that prevent challenges to the contracts are not enforceable under the patent laws of the United States. But then, I -- as I was saying, that is a matter of patent law. That's not a matter of jurisdictional law. We're here --"
  },

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "The patentee could be paying his royalties. The patentee could also be putting ads in the paper saying, \"This is not a valid patent.\" It could -- it could have acquired a lot of publicity. And, in the end, there could be reasons, and there have been such cases -- which we cited, 47 of, our brief -- where such suits have been brought. But --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "If it -- if the -- if the -- if the licensee came into court and said, \"I'm not contesting this patent,\" that would be the end of it, wouldn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "If the licensee said, \"I am not contesting that patent,\" that could be."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Oh, but the patentee would just say, \"Look, we have a license. I think the patent's valid, and you owe me a dollar a unit.\" The licensee said, \"Well, I don't think they're -- it's valid, so I owe you nothing.\" And they settle on a license for 50 cents. Why can't the patentee say, \"You know, if I get a judicial decision establishing that the patent is valid, I can charge a higher license, either when this agreement expires or for other licenses\"?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "That -- I agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice. But the practicality is that a patentee starts out with, essentially, a judgment that the patent is valid. There is a presumption of validity. And to challenge that patent -- that presumption of validity, is a very difficult undertaking. Most of them don't bother. Why would they? If they are receiving -- if they're receiving --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "I'm trying to see how far you want -- are willing to push your argument that just because there's been an agreement, or perhaps even a settlement, that that somehow or another doesn't moot the controversy, the underlying legal dispute. And it -- I gather your answer to me is that Genentech, or a patentee, can sue, even though they have an existing -- they're getting royalties from the licensee, they can still sue the licensee."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "A settlement does not deprive a Federal Court of subject-matter jurisdiction. That's the narrow point that is before this -- before this Court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Why aren't you -- you said, \"The only question before the court is jurisdictional.\" If that's so, why isn't your position that the Federal Circuit put the wrong label on this, that license is listed in 8(c) as an affirmative defense; so, whatever the outcome should be, the wrong label should -- is -- was used. It shouldn't be a subject-matter jurisdiction, shouldn't be 12(b)(1); it should be an 8(c) affirmative defense. And then the -- you're out of the jurisdiction box, but you're left with the same underlying question."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "But not the same underlying question, Justice Ginsburg, with respect, because then you are in a situation like the business forms case in the Seventh Circuit, which came out shortly after the Lear. There was a settle -- settlement, and the -- and it was argued that the settlement was not effective because of the Lear decision, and parties can't settle themselves out of the Lear decision. But that is all under 12(b)(6), and not 12(b)(1). This case involves a 12(b)(1) motion, not a 12(b)(6) --"
  },

    "speaker": "GINSBURG",

  {
    "speaker": "KESTER",

  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "-- good would it do? Suppose we said, \"Federal Circuit, you put the wrong label on it. It should be 12(b)(6), not 12(b)(1), or perhaps even 8(c), affirmative defense\"? Then you go back to the Federal Circuit, and they'll come up with the same decision, that, as long as you are licensed and are paying your royalties, you have -- and they just put a different label on it -- you have --"

  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "That would be effectively overruling Lear, which is what, I think, is what many of the parties in this case actually seek to do. Lear does not allow inhibitions of challenges to patent licenses. A licensee can challenge the validity, the enforceability of the patent. That's because there's a public interest in this, as well.  Parties cannot simply contract with each other and prevent a challenge to a -- to a patent --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But then --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "-- license."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "-- the Federal Circuit distinguished Lear, and said what -- in Lear, the licensee had stopped paying royalties. Isn't that so?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "That -- those were the facts of Lear. But -- it happened that way in Lear, but that wasn't the reasoning of Lear. Lear would not totally cover that situation, but we would submit to this Court, it shouldn't make any difference. The reasoning of Lear is the same. The licensee cannot, by contract, be estopped, licensee estoppel, from challenging a patent."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "So, there's no way, I -- under your view, that a patent holder can protect itself from suit through any license arrangement or any agreement of any kind."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "I suspect there are many ways, Mr. Chief Justice, but not by throwing them out on a jurisdictional basis at the very first moment of the lawsuit."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "How about --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "There may be ways this could be arranged at the second level, through --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Well, what are those ways -- I mean, the ones that have been mentioned as possibilities in the Government brief -- one, you rejected, and the other that was mentioned was: if you sue -- if the licensee sues, then the royalty fees will be upped. Would that be effective?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "That is a question that would arise under Lear against Adkins. And the question before this Court in that situation, if it got to this Court, would be, Is that kind of a provision compatible with the policy that was so firmly expressed by Justice Harlan in Lear, and has been reiterated in so many subsequent cases of this Court?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "So, you have rejected both of the Government's suggestions on what the patent holder might do to protect itself. Do you have anything concrete that you would concede the patent holder could do?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "I don't think that I have rejected both the Government's suggestions. I've said that they raise problems on -- as to the scope of Lear."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "With respect to -- whether we are talking about a jurisdictional defense or whether we are talking about an affirmative defense, assuming jurisdiction, is there any -- is there any reason for us to accept your position, other than the reason that you have mentioned a number of times, and that is the adoption and encouragement of a public policy that allows patent challenges freely? Is that the nub of our reasoning, if we were to support your position, either jurisdictionally, in this case, or in recognizing -- or the -- in dealing with the affirmative defense in another case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "Not quite, Justice Souter. I would say the nub of your position is the Altvater case, the Aetna case, the Maryland --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "Well, Altvater is difficult for you, isn't it? Because there was an injunction in Altvater, wasn't there?"

    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "That -- but that -- but was --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "Which raises an entirely different policy issue?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "Well, I would say what it -- what it raises is simply an extra fact, but it wasn't a necessary fact. Because this Court, in Altvater, specifically pointed out that even if there weren't an injunction there, there would be -- there would be the danger forced on the licensee, of an infringement suit; and an infringement suit means, possibly, an injunction of the patent, treble damages, any number of sanctions. An injunction suit can put a company out of business, especially like a company like my client here. And --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "But that is -- that is a good reason. And, I take it, it's your logic that that is a good reason to recognize a fairly broad right on the part of the licensee to challenge."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "Right."

    "speaker": "SOUTER",

    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "No, I realize that. But, I mean, what we've got in this case, and in any of these cases, is a question of line-drawing under Article III. And your argument is, you want to draw the line where you want it drawn primarily because there are practical reasons to favor a public policy of free challenge."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KESTER",
    "speech": "What we are presenting in this case is a dispute about money. It's not abstract. It's not hypothetical. It's not conjectural. It is concrete, immediate. All the facts are in. It's definitely adversarial. It's legal."

And, in fact, the judges below, in this series of cases, all said, \"We thought it was settled law the other way.\" All this case represents, from our point of view, is, \"Let's go back to the way it has always been.\" I'd like to reserve the balance of my time."

I think, as a policy matter -- so, moving off the question before the Court right now -- as a policy matter, the -- it's not clear from this Court's cases exactly what types of agreements would be enforceable.

And the Government thinks there's a spectrum. One -- at one end of the spectrum would be licenses like those in Pope, and at the other end of the spectrum would be a consent decree entered after settlement of a bona fide patent infringement suit where the -- which included an agreement not to settle. Now, that's clearly not what we have here."

  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "Now, is -- if -- I guess there are three possible positions on the question of whether a licensee can attack a contract, a patent where he has a license and wants to keep the contract. One, he can never do it. Two, he can always do it. Three, it depends on what the contract says. Now, do any of those questions have anything to do with the question before us, which is whether it is a case or controversy?"

    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "All right. So, basically, though, you're not certain. The Government's view would be, it is a matter as to whether you can sue claiming the patent is invalid, whether the licensee can do it, that probably -- but you're not certain, and you haven't made up your mind definitely, because it is not in this case -- but you think it's going to be something they could regulate themselves by contract."
  },

    "speaker": "MAYNARD",

The first one is styled as a -- contractual relations claims. The other three are styled as patent law claims. And it's important to emphasize, at the outset, that this Court, in Skelly Oil, in Calderone, and in, really, all of the cases, has said it's very important to look behind the labels that a Declaratory Judgment Act plaintiff puts on their claims. We need to actually see what is the cause of action they're trying to adjudicate so we can do an accurate assessment of justiciability -- standing, ripeness, Federal-question jurisdiction. I want to start by explaining why there is no contract claim at issue here. You heard today, they're trying to salvage this, say that there's a contract dispute, a dispute about the terms of the contract. They didn't argue that below, and with good reason. And I'd just point you to the briefs in the Federal Circuit. Roman numeral I, which is all about the improper dismissal of the Declaratory Judgment Act claims, refers to the fact these are, quote, \"patent-law claims,\" end quote, at page 27. Nowhere do they say that there is a dispute about the proper interpretation of the contract terms. And let me explain why. The contract terms, which were just read to you, is Section 110 of -- 1.10 at JA-399 of the license -- says that there is an obligation to pay royalties for Synagis on any claim -- not any valid claim, any claim -- that has not been held invalid by a court or other competent jurisdiction from which no appeal has, or may, be taken. Now, they never said, below, \"That clause means that we can come to court and have the court decide whether this patent is valid, and, depending on whether we win or not, then we can stop paying.\" And the reason they didn't make that argument is, it was rejected by this Court a hundred years ago, in United States versus Harvey Steel. Very similar clause. The United States says, \"This means that we don't have to pay if the patent is invalid.\" And, in an opinion by Justice Holmes, this Court rejected it out of hand by -- and said, \"This was a conventional proviso. We don't even need to look to evidence of the party's intent, because this is the standard proviso. It does not mean\" -- and they said it was a \"twisted interpretation\" that the Government was offering -- it doesn't mean that the licensee, quote, \"thought the patent bad and would like to have the Court say so now,\" end quote.

Indeed, the very purpose -- as I -- we've just heard the SG say, of this act, the Declaratory Judgment Act, seems to be to allow people who -- a contract -- who are in a real concrete disagreement, to get a declaratory judgment without getting rid of the contract.

And, just like in Steffel, if you're trying to adjudicate, on an anticipatory basis, an enforcement action, you have to show that you would reasonably fear that enforcement action. And, in fact, Steffel uses that language, and Poe versus Ullman dismisses a case for failure to establish a genuine fear of prosecution. But then, you have to go one step beyond, and that is to say, Are they -- is the cause of action not ripening because the declaratory judgment plaintiff is forfeiting their legal rights in order to avoid some very severe harm that would be cognizable coercion?

It -- the law -- by the time that this license was executed in the Federal Circuit, there was a case, called Shell Oil, where the Court specifically held that a licensee cannot take advantage of the protections of Lear until it has repudiated the license, stopped paying, and said that it wants to challenge validity.

I think -- I think, Mr. Chief Justice, you were, a while ago, putting the horse in front of the cart, which was right where it belongs. The contract claim is clear in the record. It's at page 136 of the joint appendix. I don't think more needs to be said about it. Harvey Steel, on which Respondents rely, was, of course, overruled --"

    "speech": "I believe it was. I'd have to go back and -- you mean in terms of the oral argument. It was certainly in the briefs. It was certainly not waived. There was never, of course, any -- anything in the license, or anyplace else, where Petitioner gave up the right to sue. Petitioner doesn't need permission in the license to sue. And as for the shock in the lower courts when this case was decided, I would call to your attention what the Federal Circuit, in 1983, itself, said, and it quoted the Warner-Jenkinson case, which was the Second Circuit case that my friend dismissed somewhat. The C.R. Bard case -- this is Federal Circuit, early -- starts out, the opening line -- it says, and I quote -- this is 716 F.2d 875 -- \"We hold that a patent license need not be terminated before a patent licensee may bring a Federal declaratory judgment action,\" close quote. And the last words of the same opinion, at 882 of 716 F.2d, are, \"We hold that a patent licensee may bring a Federal declaratory judgment action to declare the Federal -- to declare the patent subject to the license invalid without prior termination of the -- of the license.\" That was 1983. Gen-Probe was 2004. Something happened in the interval. Finally, the discussion of settlements here strikes me as, indeed, strange, because if this -- if a license were to be redesignated as a settlement, we would have the situation here where -- a license was signed in 1977; the only patent at issue in this case was not even issued until 2001."
