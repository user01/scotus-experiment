2 (10:03 a.m.)

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument in the

4 case of Rousey against Jacoway.

5 Ms. Karlan.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8 MS. KARLAN: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

9 it please the Court:

10 Yesterday in Koons Buick against Nigh, this

11 Court emphasized once again that statutory interpretation

12 is a holistic process based on common sense, that the

13 reading of the statute should look at all the words to

14 avoid a passing strange or an anomalous result when the

15 text does not dictate it and the statutory history

16 suggests otherwise.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: That was a case I dissented in,

18 wasn't it?

19 MS. KARLAN: Yes, but actually, Justice Scalia,

20 I think even you will find our case more appealing.

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but -- but it is true you

22 have a strong textual --

23 MS. KARLAN: We have an excellent textual

24 argument.

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was a little bit surprised

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 at your opening because it seems to me you have a strong

2 textual argument you're now defending.

3 MS. KARLAN: We do. A holistic reading of the

4 text shows that section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy

5 Code --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What does a holistic reading

7 mean? Can you stay within the --

8 MS. KARLAN: Absolutely.

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- text and still be holistic?

10 MS. KARLAN: I'm not going to look outside the

11 text at all.

12 A holistic reading of section 522(d)(10)(e) of

13 the Bankruptcy Code, which is on -- in the petitioners'

14 brief at pages 1 through 2 --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: What does the word holistic

16 mean?

17 (Laughter.)

18 MS. KARLAN: I think it means read all the words

19 in the sense that makes the most sense to you rather than

20 plucking words at random or rather than looking at a word

21 artificially. For example, when you look at a phrase like

22 on account of in the Bankruptcy Code, as the Court did in

23 North LaSalle, account means a lot of different things,

24 but there it clearly meant because of, as it does in this

25 statute.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the antonym would be

2 parsimonious or something like that?

3 MS. KARLAN: I think it'd be partial, but I'm

4 not sure.

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let -- let me ask --

6 MS. KARLAN: Sure.

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- ask you this. The -- the

8 statute does say that the right to receive a payment is on

9 account of age, and that seems to me to be an argument

10 somewhat in respondent's favor because the -- the payment

11 has to be triggered by the age, if you read it that way,

12 and it seems to me that's a fair way to read it.

13 MS. KARLAN: Yes, and I think payments are

14 triggered by age because section 522(d)(10)(e) is a

15 statute eminently about the protection in bankruptcy of

16 retirement payments. For individuals --

17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the problem for the

18 court below was that the person covered can ask for it in

19 a lump sum and pay a penalty.

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right, and that's not --

21 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And -- and that isn't then on

22 the basis of age. Am I right? Is that -- that was the

23 problem the court had below.

24 MS. KARLAN: Yes, that's the problem the court

25 had below. I think it's an illusory problem for the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 following reason.

2 It's clear that the right to receive full

3 enjoyment of payments under an IRA does not attach until

4 one of the triggering events occurs. The trigger events

5 are age 59 and a half, disability, illness, or for the

6 estate, death. And that's the right that we're talking

7 about here, and that's why --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, when you say full

9 enjoyment, you -- you think when -- when I'm taxed on

10 something, I -- I don't have full enjoyment of it? The

11 only thing triggered by age, as far as I can tell -- the

12 only thing triggered by age -- is your obtaining of a tax

13 benefit. That's all. Once you reach a certain age, you

14 can withdraw it without -- without paying the 10 percent

15 tax.

16 MS. KARLAN: That's correct, but the 10 percent

17 tax here is designed and does, in fact, operate as a

18 deterrent and a penalty.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm sure it does, but --

20 but it's -- it's hard to accept the notion that simply

21 because after a certain age I get a tax benefit, I'm

22 receiving the money on account of my age. That doesn't

23 make any sense to me.

24 MS. KARLAN: Well, Justice Scalia, the way that

25 I would view that is prior to age 59 and a half, you pay a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 penalty. And Congress put that penalty in there because

2 the holistic sense, the full reading of section

3 522(d)(10)(e) is it is designed to protect retirement

4 savings, replacement income of the elderly, the disabled,

5 or ill people, once they get to the point where those

6 triggering events, which are in 522(d)(10)(e), occur.

7 Those are the same triggering events --

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Karlan, the -- as long as

9 this money was in the plan, it was shielded from

10 bankruptcy, and there are -- there was not unlimited

11 access even with the penalty when it was in the plan. One

12 thing that I don't know and may be of some significance,

13 did the Rouseys have a chance, even though they lost their

14 employment, to keep their money in the plan where it would

15 be shielded from bankruptcy or did they have to roll it

16 over?

17 MS. KARLAN: Northrop Grumman's policy is to

18 require individuals who leave the company's employment to

19 roll their pension plans into an IRA. The Rouseys tried

20 to get work in Arkansas when they moved there. Had they

21 gotten a job there that they were able to keep, which they

22 were unable to do because of their health, they could have

23 rolled that money back into an undeniably, completely

24 exemptible.

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Another employer's plan.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. KARLAN: That's correct.

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they could not have kept

3 it in this employer's plan?

4 MS. KARLAN: No. This employer did not permit

5 individuals to keep the money in the plan. They were told

6 they had to remove the money when they lost their jobs.

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was a term of the plan

8 that it -- you can remain in it only so long as you're

9 employed?

10 MS. KARLAN: Apparently so.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are there any other plans that

12 are -- are entities clearly covered by the statute in

13 which the only effect of age is to enable you to avoid a

14 tax?

15 MS. KARLAN: Yes, Your Honor.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Well, then --

17 MS. KARLAN: Let me give you a couple --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- then you might persuade me.

19 MS. KARLAN: Let me give you a couple of

20 examples --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

22 MS. KARLAN: -- that I think will be quite

23 familiar. A 401(k) plan allows you to get access to money

24 before you turn 59 and a half on account of hardship, and

25 you pay a 10 percent tax penalty if you do so.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 The Federal Government's thrift savings plan for

2 Federal employees allows you to take a loan out of the

3 plan and to pay the interest back into your own account

4 before you turn 59 and a half, thereby essentially giving

5 you free use of the money. If you don't pay the loan

6 back, it's then treated as a -- as a distribution, and you

7 pay the 10 percent tax penalty on it.

8 So that if you read this statute to -- not to

9 include IRA's, to deny exemption to IRA's, you read this

10 statute to deny exemption to virtually all of the modern

11 forms of defined contribution pension plans or savings

12 plans.

13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. That was what I was

14 going -- aren't most of the pension profit-sharing, stock

15 bonus plans, and annuities similar to the IRA's in terms

16 of allowing withdrawal on the payment of a penalty?

17 MS. KARLAN: Absolutely, Your Honor.

18 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I thought they were all

19 in the same boat. So what the effect of this rule is --

20 of the Ninth Circuit is that they would all fail to

21 qualify --

22 MS. KARLAN: Yes, that's correct. You would

23 render section 522(d)(10)(e) essentially a nullity.

24 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Oh, it's the Eighth Circuit.

25 Excuse me.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. KARLAN: Yes. I -- I can see why you might

2 have thought it was the Ninth Circuit.

3 (Laughter.)

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it might be wrong anyway.

5 (Laughter.)

6 MS. KARLAN: Yes, yes.

7 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the percentage amount

8 of the payments that are taken out of all IRA plans before

9 people are 59 and a half?

10 MS. KARLAN: Well, in the Cilek case from the

11 Seventh Circuit, which is cited in our brief, the court

12 there cited statistics that suggested it was between 1.2

13 and 1.7 percent of funds in IRA's were removed early under

14 the penalty process.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: And the -- the payment here --

16 it says -- the statute uses the word payment. So suppose

17 you simply have an IRA plan but you don't take money out

18 of it. Then is it exempt from bankruptcy?

19 MS. KARLAN: It would be because it's the right

20 to the future payments and not just the present payments,

21 Justice Breyer.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so -- but I'm trying --

23 what I'm trying to figure out is if a person were to take

24 -- just reading it in English, it sounds as if a person

25 were to take the plan out before he's 59 and a half and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 pay the penalty, that that amount that he took out would

2 not be a -- a payment because of age, but one that he took

3 out after he's 59 and a half and didn't pay the penalty

4 would be.

5 MS. KARLAN: That's correct, Justice Breyer.

6 But in order to protect the ability to take money out

7 after someone turns 59, you have to protect the corpus of

8 the IRA now because otherwise, when he turns 59 and a

9 half, there won't be any money there for him to take out.

10 And that's why the exemption extends not just to present

11 payments, as the Third Circuit erroneously held, but also

12 to the corpus when it is necessary for the support of the

13 debtor. And I can't emphasize --

14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Ms. Karlan, let me ask

15 something about that very point because the statute says

16 that to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of

17 the debtor it's allowable.

18 MS. KARLAN: Yes, Justice O'Connor.

19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are you aware of cases where

20 the bankruptcy court has said, well, you don't need all

21 that money? That's a big plan. You don't need all that.

22 We'll just let you deduct X amount.

23 MS. KARLAN: Absolutely, Justice O'Connor. We

24 cite a number of them in both the opening brief and in the

25 yellow brief on pages 19 through -- to 20, I think is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 where we -- where we talk about --

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we take this concrete

3 case? Hers was something over $12,000; his, something

4 over $42,000.

5 MS. KARLAN: Yes.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the claim here as to

7 -- was part or all of that -- it would be some $54,000.

8 MS. KARLAN: The claim was all that all of that

9 was necessary. If I could give an example that I think

10 Justice O'Connor might find instructive here. When a

11 debtor, for example, is 40 years old, they generally

12 require turnover of the entire IRA because people have

13 time to earn the money back again. When the debtor has

14 other retirement savings, for example, in a case from

15 Virginia called Abate, because the person also had a

16 401(k) plan, they were required to turn over the entire

17 IRA. When a debtor is able to work, even if the debtor is

18 in his or her 50's, courts will often require exclusion of

19 at -- will also require turnover of at least part of the

20 IRA. In this case --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what do the courts do

22 if they say, well, my client might be ill or something

23 like that? It seems to me --

24 MS. KARLAN: Well, if the client is ill now,

25 they get to keep it --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. They -- they say my

2 client is able-bodied now, but we -- we need something

3 because -- I don't know -- there's a history of family

4 illness or something.

5 MS. KARLAN: There isn't a reported case that

6 talks about the possibility of future illness as a reason

7 of exempting the money.

8 JUSTICE BREYER: It's -- I'm trying to figure

9 out how -- how -- what the theory is. Is -- you say I

10 have a right to receive payments because of age. And you

11 say, well, here I have a body of money and 99 percent

12 comes out of it after you're 60. 1 percent comes out

13 before. So it's very tempting to say that that corpus

14 there, of course, is a body of money that you're going to

15 have a right to receive because of age because the

16 practical effect of the 10 percent is -- is -- stops the

17 -- the younger person getting the money.

18 So does the case then turn on that? I mean,

19 suppose -- suppose it were a 3 percent penalty and 40

20 percent of the people took out the money before they were

21 60 or a 1 percent penalty and 80 percent did it. Then

22 should I reach the other result? I'm just trying to think

23 of how does this analysis work. What's the right

24 analysis?

25 MS. KARLAN: I would say at the 1 percent and 80

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 percent of the people are taking the money out, it

2 wouldn't operate really as a retirement plan anymore.

3 But if I can give another statistic that might

4 be helpful in thinking about this. 18 percent of the

5 participants in large 401(k) plans who are under the age

6 of 50 are taking loans out against those plans today.

7 JUSTICE BREYER: What percent?

8 MS. KARLAN: 18 percent in one of the surveys.

9 And yet, those plans are undeniably, absolutely exempt

10 under the bankruptcy --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they're taking out loans

12 against it. They're -- they're not withdrawing the money.

13 MS. KARLAN: Well, but the loans because -- for

14 example, in the Federal thrift savings plan, the interest

15 is being paid back into your own account, it's essentially

16 as close to taking out the money as you can get.

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I still don't have your answer

18 to the problem that bothered me at the first. How -- how

19 do you reconcile your positions with on account of

20 language? If the -- if your clients can take the money --

21 just take the money out of the IRA at any time, then why

22 is it on account of age?

23 MS. KARLAN: It -- it's not the -- if you look

24 at the statute -- and let me just work my way through it

25 with you. It's the right to a payment under a stock

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 bonus, profit-sharing, annuity, or similar plan on account

2 of illness. And the question is what does on account of

3 modify there. I think the most natural and sensible

4 reading of the statute is a plan that is because of age, a

5 plan that is because of disability, and the like.

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you say that payment

7 doesn't -- on account of doesn't modify payment.

8 MS. KARLAN: I don't -- I don't think you need

9 to read it that way, and I think the most sensible reading

10 here, especially given that the statute --

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I think the logical

12 reading is that it -- it modifies payment.

13 MS. KARLAN: Well, I -- I'm not sure that it

14 does, but even if it did, Your Honor --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Holistic for me. What

16 -- what does it -- what does it modify? I mean, if you

17 had to diagram it, on account of goes to what noun?

18 MS. KARLAN: Well, this is again -- I know you

19 dissented yesterday, but this is a less than meticulously

20 crafted statute.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I thought I was being

22 holistic yesterday, to tell you the truth.

23 (Laughter.)

24 MS. KARLAN: Okay. Okay.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: But --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. KARLAN: Well --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- but what does on account of

3 modify?

4 MS. KARLAN: I think what on account of modifies

5 here is the kind of plan out of which the payment is

6 coming.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is that noun?

8 MS. KARLAN: There are a variety of plans, stock

9 bonus, pension --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: The right to receive a payment

11 under a stock bonus, pension --

12 MS. KARLAN: Yes.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- profit sharing, annuity, or

14 similar plan or -- or contract. It's a plan on account of

15 illness, an annuity?

16 MS. KARLAN: Plans --

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why isn't it a right on

18 account of?

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the right on account of.

20 MS. KARLAN: Well, I think you can read it

21 either way and you'll get to exactly the same result. So

22 let me read it the way that you've been reading it, which

23 is if you want to protect the ability of people who have

24 IRA's to withdraw money on account of age, you have to

25 protect the IRA now or there will be no money in it for

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 them to exercise their right to withdraw on account of

2 age.

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but -- but there still is

4 a right to take payments at any time.

5 MS. KARLAN: Justice -- Justice Kennedy, we

6 don't believe --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so then you're --

8 you're --

9 MS. KARLAN: -- that that's actually a right.

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under that, you're giving the

11 -- the language that follows it no meaning.

12 MS. KARLAN: No, Justice Kennedy, I don't think

13 that's what I'm doing here, and the reason I don't think

14 that's what I'm doing is because this statute clearly

15 refers to IRA's by name as one of the plans that's

16 entitled to exemption.

17 JUSTICE BREYER: But as purely English -- as

18 purely English, I read it as saying it's a right. What is

19 that right? The right is a right to receive a payment on

20 account of age. That's the -- a plan. That's the right.

21 Now, your argument, I take it, was -- is that

22 yes, it's true you also have a right under certain

23 conditions to take it without respect to age. So what we

24 have here is a plan that gives you both kind of rights.

25 MS. KARLAN: That's correct.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: It's a kind that gives you a

2 right to take it with a penalty and a right to take it

3 because of age without a penalty. And thus, the question

4 is, is that kind of plan which gives you both kind of

5 rights covered? And the language doesn't answer it.

6 So --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But under Justice Breyer's

8 hypothetical, that's just like a savings account.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

10 MS. KARLAN: No.

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, because the savings account

12 doesn't have -- I mean, the savings account doesn't have

13 the -- the penalty. Isn't your argument that you've got

14 to read the right as meaning a right without penalty,

15 because if you don't read it that way, then every one of

16 these other retirement instruments is likewise going to

17 fail? Isn't that your -- your strong point?

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's your strong point.

19 MS. KARLAN: That's correct. That's -- that's

20 our strong point and we're sticking with it.

21 (Laughter.)

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Right -- it's not a

23 right if you have to pay a penalty for it.

24 MS. KARLAN: That's correct. It's not a right,

25 as we say in the reply brief, to park on the sidewalk

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 because if you pay the parking ticket, you can park there.

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

3 MS. KARLAN: And I think no matter how --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a good argument. I like

5 that.

6 MS. KARLAN: Thank you.

7 (Laughter.)

8 MS. KARLAN: No matter how you read the statute,

9 it's designed to cover IRA's, and any reading of the

10 statute that ends up not covering IRA's will also not

11 cover many of the other --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't Congress just put

13 in IRA's along with the other things?

14 MS. KARLAN: They did, Justice Ginsburg. They

15 did in the last line of the statute.

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but that's sort of an

17 oblique way to get it there. I mean, why didn't they put

18 it together with the other string of plans?

19 MS. KARLAN: Well, my best guess as to why they

20 didn't do that is they started drafting the exemptions

21 statute in 1973 and they enacted IRA's in 1974, so they

22 stuck it in at the end of the list. That's my best guess.

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: What --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: What your -- what your

25 opponents say is that the -- the thing at the end doesn't

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

1 prove anything because they're willing to acknowledge that

2 some IRA's can be so structured that you cannot withdraw

3 until -- until you reach a certain age. And if they're

4 structured that way, they would be covered. So you had to

5 mention 408 in the -- in the exceptions. What's wrong

6 with that argument?

7 MS. KARLAN: Well, what's wrong with that,

8 Justice Scalia, is that all IRA's are designed and they're

9 administered on forms that the Internal Revenue Service

10 sets out and you buy the forms to allow for early

11 withdrawal. So under their theory, there has -- there is

12 not now and there has never been a single IRA anywhere in

13 the United States --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --

15 MS. KARLAN: -- that had that inability to take

16 the money out subject to penalty prior to the age 59 and a

17 half.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do -- do we know that? I mean,

19 couldn't someone -- I -- I don't think this is a very

20 plausible basis for construing the statute, but just as a

21 technical matter, couldn't someone go to the bank or

22 brokerage firm and say I want to set up an IRA, but I want

23 the IRA to be, in -- in effect, like an irrevocable trust

24 in which withdrawals can only be made on certain, specific

25 conditions? And couldn't someone, using both the IRA

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 mechanism and a State irrevocable trust document, create

2 an IRA that would be as restricted as -- as the circuit

3 suggested it might be?

4 MS. KARLAN: I don't necessarily think so for

5 the following reason. IRA's are off-the-rack products.

6 They're a basic consumer product that 40 million people

7 buy. People don't usually negotiate the terms.

8 If you did negotiate the terms, though, here's

9 the second problem. Anytime you deviate from the form

10 that the Internal Revenue Service gives you, which also

11 gives you these rights to withdraw early subject to

12 penalty, you run the risk that your plan will then be held

13 to be a nonqualifying plan under section 408 of the tax

14 code. You then lose the ability to deduct the

15 contributions going in. You then lose the ability to

16 defer the payments on the income as it accrues in the

17 account.

18 Now, to answer the last part of your question,

19 one of the things that has occurred over the last, say, 5

20 to 10 years is more and more States are passing laws that

21 essentially protect IRA's in bankruptcy and out, as a

22 matter of State law, from any attachment by creditors.

23 Why do they do that? Because they recognize that IRA's

24 are a fundamental piece of the retirement system today.

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And some don't. And the --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and the State systems vary.

2 MS. KARLAN: That's correct, but only four

3 States offer no protection to IRA's from creditors as

4 opposed to --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: As opposed to how many who

6 do?

7 MS. KARLAN: 46 States offer some kind of

8 protection. 23 States protect them without limit in

9 bankruptcy and out. 6 of them protect them inside of

10 bankruptcy using the State exemptions as long as the

11 amount is reasonable and necessary for the debtor's

12 support.

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's what -- with the

14 purpose that we're talking about now --

15 MS. KARLAN: That's correct.

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if it's only 6 that, faced

17 with a bankruptcy, would shelter the IRA.

18 MS. KARLAN: No. No. 23 of them would protect

19 all IRA's. 6 would protect all IRA's if the money in them

20 is necessary to the debtor's support, an additional 6. 6

21 more would protect all the money in an IRA as long as it

22 was deposited 120 days or a year or 3 years before the

23 debtor filed for bankruptcy. 3 of them will protect all

24 IRA's up to a dollar amount. In Nevada, the dollar amount

25 is $500,000. 8 States use, as their State exemption law,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 an IRA that -- a statute that has exactly the same

2 language as the Federal statute. 6 of those State

3 statutes have been interpreted by Federal courts to

4 protect IRA's.

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But here there was no choice

6 of picking up on the State?

7 MS. KARLAN: There's a -- there's a weird

8 anomaly in Arkansas, Your Honor, which is Arkansas law

9 does, in fact, protect IRA's, but the Federal bankruptcy

10 courts in Arkansas have interpreted that law only to

11 protect the IRA up to $500 because of a provision in the

12 Arkansas constitution, article 9, section 2, that means

13 that you can only save up to $500. So any bankrupt person

14 in Arkansas who wants to keep any money in his -- in his

15 IRA has to elect the Federal exemptions rather than

16 electing the State exemptions.

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And one train that we didn't

18 finish before. You were explaining that in this case the

19 entire $55,000 -- that entire sum would be needed -- would

20 be necessary for the support of the debtors.

21 MS. KARLAN: That's correct. The bankruptcy

22 court did not rule on our claim that it was all reasonably

23 necessary because they decided first that IRA's didn't

24 come within the meaning of section 522.

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- that was your

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 claim, and I --

2 MS. KARLAN: Yes, Your Honor.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How did you come to that

4 conclusion, that the entire amount?

5 MS. KARLAN: Well, if you take, say, $55,000 and

6 you ask what sort of annuity could you purchase when you

7 hit age 59 and a half with that money, it will be an

8 annuity that, I would guess -- you know, I -- I hate to do

9 math in my head like this. I'd guess it would throw off a

10 couple of hundred dollars a month in additional income.

11 And so if you ask will the Rouseys need that

12 money for their support, I think the answer is yes because

13 their only other support --

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well. Oh, yes.

15 MS. KARLAN: -- is Social Security and a $2,000

16 a month defined benefit plan that will never go up and

17 against which their Social Security will be offset. So

18 when they start becoming eligible, as Mr. Rousey is about

19 to be, for Social Security, that defined benefit plan

20 reduces their benefits. So if the Rouseys are to have an

21 old age in which they can afford to live in any kind of

22 reasonable circumstance at all, they need this money.

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back and just nail

24 down one lose end in -- in an answer that you -- you gave

25 to my question, can you set up a kind of irrevocable? I

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 assume clearly from what you say is that there is not only

2 no statute, but no IRS reg or ruling to the effect that

3 you can make your IRA terms more restrictive without

4 jeopardizing your qualification.

5 MS. KARLAN: I was unable to find one, Your

6 Honor.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

8 MS. KARLAN: I'd like to reserve the remainder

9 of my time.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't the Government come

11 in here, just as a matter of curiosity? We don't have an

12 amicus brief here from the Government, do we?

13 MS. KARLAN: I -- no, we do not have one, and I

14 don't --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Government has no position

16 on the matter.

17 MS. KARLAN: Well, I -- I don't think they've

18 taken a position here. I will say that in Patterson

19 against Shumate, they referred to IRA's in a footnote in

20 their brief, I believe, as pension plans under section

21 408.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: There -- they never go

23 bankrupt, so the position they usually take is against

24 any exemption from the --

1 MS. KARLAN: Well -- well, that's correct. The

2 United States trustee may have wanted them to -- I'd like

3 to reserve the remainder of my time.

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. McKiever.

5 ORAL ARGUMENT OF COLLI C. McKIEVER

6 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7 MS. McKIEVER: Justice Stevens, may it please

8 the Court:

9 Pursuant to section 522(d)(10)(e) of the

10 Bankruptcy Code, a debtor's right to receive a payment is

11 not exempt unless two requirements are met. First, the

12 right to receive the payment must be on account of

13 illness, disability, death, age or length of service, and

14 the right must come from a specified similar plan or

15 contract. Because neither of those elements is satisfied

16 in this case, the petitioners' IRA's are not exempt.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it the case that

18 other plans that are clearly covered by the text of this

19 statute also permit early withdrawal for certain reasons?

20 MS. McKIEVER: Yes and no, and let me explain

21 that. Yes, they do permit withdrawals based upon certain

22 factors. Those are enumerated based -- based upon each

23 individual plan. However, they do not permit withdrawals

24 for any reason at any time for any purpose.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not a single one of them.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. McKIEVER: Not a single one of them. Now,

2 of course, I've not read every plan ever created, but none

3 of the plans that I have ever seen, as the specified

4 plans, the pension plans, the profit-sharing plans, any of

5 those, allow withdrawal for any reason at any time.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you'd say that if one of

7 them did, it would also not be covered.

8 MS. McKIEVER: That's correct. It -- it is

9 thought --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what --

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: I take it -- in -- in answering

12 Justice Scalia, I take it from what you didn't say that

13 none of the -- we'll call them kind of the paradigm

14 example plans are, however, as -- as restricted as the

15 language in this -- this statute would suggest that it had

16 to be if you read it in a -- in a very literal way.

17 MS. McKIEVER: There are --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, they're all a

19 little bit sinful, at least, even if they're not as sinful

20 as -- as you say the -- the 401 -- the -- the IRA is.

21 MS. McKIEVER: That -- that is correct. The --

22 there probably are plans out there -- once again, there

23 are so many plans. And those are created by financial

24 institutions, by employers, by different entities. So

25 therefore there are thousands of variations of those.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, why? Okay. Once you're

2 down that road, you have conceded, as you must, that a

3 plan that says you get the money because of age but you

4 also can get the money without respect to age in certain

5 circumstances can be a plan covered by the act. Now,

6 that's the kind of a plan that's right in front of you.

7 So, therefore, literally it falls just as much within the

8 language as the other that you want to say even though

9 that is literally true, this plan is very different from

10 the others in terms of the purposes of the act. That's

11 what I would like to hear because to me, I'm not so moved

12 by holistic as I am by purposes, which is part of

13 holistic.

14 So -- so the -- the point that I would like to

15 know is why, since ordinary people think of IRA's as

16 pensions -- I do. I think of it that way. I don't know

17 much about it. It's designed to help in the future, help

18 when you're old and sick. But there is this extra thing

19 in it which you point to. So why, in terms of purposes is

20 this different from the others?

21 MS. McKIEVER: This is different because this is

22 the only kind of plan where you can access the funds at

23 any time for any purpose. It is also --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: I know that, but -- but -- and

25 you do it with a penalty. We agree about the facts.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. McKIEVER: That's correct.

2 JUSTICE BREYER: But I want to know why that

3 difference makes a difference in a world where only 1 or

4 less 2 percent of the people do access it before they're

5 60, 59 and a half.

6 MS. McKIEVER: Because the right to -- to

7 receive the payment, the right to access the money at any

8 time exists no matter if it is exercised or not, and it

9 does not meet the language of the statute. The statute

10 very specifically --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I -- you've missed my

12 point and I'm sorry. I put you on the wrong track with my

13 following up. I shouldn't have.

14 MS. McKIEVER: I'm sorry. Yes.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: My question is we all agree

16 that there can be plans where you can get the money not

17 having to do with age, and they fall within the language

18 of the act, and indeed, you say some are covered. But

19 this one you say is worse than the others in terms of the

20 purposes of the act, and that's what I want to hear why.

21 MS. McKIEVER: Because there is no causal

22 connection between any of the factors that are enumerated

23 in the statute and the right to receive the money. And

24 that is --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?

2 Supposing instead of a 10 percent penalty, there was an

3 absolute prohibition, would you agree -- on getting the

4 money before you're 59 and a half, would then that

5 qualify?

6 MS. McKIEVER: Absolutely, yes, it would.

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: Now, what if there were a 50

8 percent penalty?

9 MS. McKIEVER: Clearly, there's a point at which

10 it would qualify as a prohibition more than just --

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: And what is it that makes it a

12 prohibition? Is it -- is it because the purpose is to

13 deter withdrawals, or it is that it becomes economically

14 unacceptable? What -- what is the reason for drawing the

15 line somewhere above 10 percent?

16 MS. McKIEVER: The reason for drawing the line

17 is because at 10 percent, as the Eighth Circuit has stated

18 in -- in the Huebner case, it -- it said that it's a

19 minimal penalty. However, there is still the unfettered

20 access that's available.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: But what is the purpose of

22 imposing any penalty at all?

23 MS. McKIEVER: I would assume as a disincentive

24 to -- to withdraw, but it's clearly not a prohibition,

25 such as the -- the parking --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: But 50 percent would not be a

2 prohibition and neither would 90 percent.

3 MS. McKIEVER: It would not be a prohibition,

4 but it would operate more as a prohibition than 10

5 percent.

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: So it's a matter of degree

7 rather than a difference in kind.

8 MS. McKIEVER: Clearly that -- it's a very

9 difficult line to draw. I -- I can't make that call at

10 this moment, but --

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me the easiest

12 black letter rule is no tax or some tax. I mean, if it

13 was totally free like an ordinary bank account, then you'd

14 be dead right. But the fact that for a -- an important

15 purpose there is a 10 percent penalty put in seems to me

16 puts it into the category of things that are -- you're not

17 supposed to have an absolute right to get.

18 MS. McKIEVER: But the -- the hallmark

19 difference here is that it -- it is the only type of

20 account that you can access paying the penalty for any

21 reason --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume --

23 MS. McKIEVER: -- regardless of the specified

24 reason.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that -- that your answer to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Justice Breyer as to why that makes a difference with

2 regard to the purpose of the statute is that the purpose

3 of the statute is to make sure that people have money for

4 their retirement, and that if you can withdraw it for any

5 reason whatever, there is no security that that money will

6 be there for their retirement; whereas if you limit the

7 reasons to sickness and -- and a certain other number of

8 emergency reasons, the chances the money will be there for

9 the retirement are much higher.

10 MS. McKIEVER: Well, that -- that's --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that the answer?

12 JUSTICE BREYER: But if that's the answer,

13 excellent. So now we have --

14 (Laughter.)

15 JUSTICE BREYER: -- let's say --

16 MS. McKIEVER: Thank you, Justice Scalia.

17 JUSTICE BREYER: Let's try -- let's try a

18 million percent tax and nobody in history has ever

19 withdrawn the money. Now, would -- that you would say

20 would fall within this.

21 MS. McKIEVER: Yes.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine, yes.

23 MS. McKIEVER: Yes.

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, if that would fall

25 within this, going back to Justice Stevens, because that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 operates as a bar to prevent the bad world that Justice

2 Scalia mentioned, why doesn't a tax that operates as a bar

3 that's good enough to stop 98.5 percent of the people from

4 withdrawing their money and having nothing left for old

5 age -- why isn't that just as good as the million percent

6 tax in a world that is imperfect?

7 MS. McKIEVER: Because clearly the -- the access

8 of money and the ability to use it prior to retirement,

9 just as -- as Justice Scalia just stated, that allows the

10 -- the debtors to -- to access freely for any purpose,

11 clearly not showing that -- that it would be for

12 retirement purposes.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: But attachment of the --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right, but it's acquired.

15 Say -- say retirement, not old age. I mean, you know, 60

16 -- it's not that bad --

17 (Laughter.)

18 JUSTICE BREYER: 93.

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if that is going to be

20 your criterion, the -- the total freedom for any purpose,

21 then why, if we accept your argument, why -- why don't we

22 face sort of a daunting run or the courts face sort of

23 daunting future? Because the -- the question then is

24 going to be, well, what purposes are sufficiently close to

25 old age to -- to allow for a continued exemption and how

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 free may the purposes be before a plan falls into the IRA

2 category. You told us a few moments ago -- and I'm sure

3 you -- you were right -- that the kind of the paradigm

4 example plans vary enormously depending on the terms in

5 which employers set them up. So if -- if we say that the

6 -- the dividing line is going to be between plans under

7 which withdrawal can be for any purpose versus plans in

8 which withdrawal is going to be somehow limited, then

9 we're going to have to litigate an awful lot of plans.

10 Aren't we?

11 MS. McKIEVER: Not necessarily. The -- the line

12 that we're really looking to is that there has to be a

13 direct causation factor between one of the five specified

14 factors such as on -- on account of factors, age,

15 disability, death, length of service, and the right to

16 receive the payment.

17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but typically these

18 plans like 401(k) plans permit hardship withdrawals, and

19 other plans that are mentioned in the act allow

20 withdrawals for medical reasons or to buy housing or

21 something like that. I mean, you -- we would just have

22 endless cases trying to figure out what qualifies and what

23 doesn't. It seems like such a hard line for you to try to

24 draw here.

25 MS. McKIEVER: Well --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And every plan that I know of

2 allows withdrawal if you terminate employment.

3 MS. McKIEVER: And that's typically --

4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: In fact, that's what happened

5 to these people.

6 So I just don't see how your argument is going

7 to --

8 MS. McKIEVER: Well, the -- the ability to

9 access the funds, oftentimes with termination, has to do

10 with the length of service, the years in service because

11 they accumulate and oftentimes are not payable at the full

12 percentage. They're not fully vested until that time.

13 Also, with the -- when there are multiple

14 factors existing in the right to receive the payments,

15 each multiple factor can be a cause of the -- of the

16 ability to reach the money. When there are no meaningful

17 factors imposed, though --

18 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Isn't it simpler to just

19 recognize that these plans are covered despite the right

20 to withdraw and then rely on the provision in the statute

21 that only permits the deduction to the extent reasonably

22 necessary for the support? I mean, that -- that seems to

23 me a fall-back position that's provided for in the

24 statute.

25 MS. McKIEVER: I understand that -- that may

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 appear to be correct, but the problem with that is that as

2 -- taxpayer status is not the hallmark in this case of if

3 it is or is not exempt. Therefore, all types of accounts,

4 whether they are truly retirement accounts or -- or if

5 they're just savings accounts, could potentially qualify

6 under this statute. If -- if you want to open it up and

7 -- and allow all kinds of accounts to be exemptible under

8 522(d)(10)(e), the problem is that there is no limit on

9 what can be potentially exempt under that statute.

10 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: No. Well, obviously, it's --

11 it's governed by the statutory provision that it has to be

12 a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, annuity, or

13 similar plan or contract on account of, and so on.

14 MS. McKIEVER: That's correct.

15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And it includes IRA's

16 apparently because of the last provision in the statute

17 referring back to individual retirement acts under section

18 408 of the Internal Revenue Code.

19 MS. McKIEVER: The section 408 reference is --

20 does not in any way expand the exemption. In fact, it is

21 a further condition to place on the -- the exemption.

22 First of all, section 408 sets out only the minimum

23 requirements for an IRA to qualify as a -- as a tax-

24 favored plan. That --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. -- Ms. Karlan says she

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 doesn't know of any -- of any IRA that did place a -- a

2 restriction which would bring it within that exemption

3 even though the ordinary IRA wouldn't be within the

4 exemption. Do you know of any IRA, a single IRA that --

5 that has a provision in it restricting withdrawal?

6 MS. McKIEVER: Absolutely. Those are

7 customizable plans. Any person can go into --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: They can, but do -- do you know

9 that there's -- there's one out there? I don't know --

10 MS. McKIEVER: I -- I do know of several out

11 there.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: You didn't just draw one up for

13 this case, did you?

14 (Laughter.)

15 MS. McKIEVER: I did not create one for this

16 case. No, I did not.

17 But they -- they definitely exist. In fact, in

18 the Andersen case out of the Eighth Circuit Bankruptcy

19 Appellate Panel, the debtor had an annuity and prior to

20 the filing of the bankruptcy petition, she elected that

21 she would only receive periodic payments based upon her

22 age, and that was found to be exempt by the Bankruptcy

23 Appellate Panel because that qualified. The payments were

24 based upon her age, and it was then a similar plan because

25 she could not access the funds at any time but only for

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the specified reason such as age.

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was that -- was that an IRA

3 that she had? It was an IRA?

4 MS. McKIEVER: My understanding is, yes, it was

5 under section 408(b) was -- that's my understanding based

6 upon that case.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me ask you.

8 Maybe this is irrelevant, but were -- were these

9 restrictive IRA's that you're aware of set up under those

10 terms in contemplation of bankruptcy? If the answer is

11 no, why would anyone so restrict his -- his IRA?

12 MS. McKIEVER: I -- I do not know if that one

13 specifically was, but no. These have not been set up

14 through --

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: But why -- why would anyone do

16 that? They're -- they're qualified without these

17 restrictions. Why would anyone want to cut off his -- his

18 rights to -- to withdraw?

19 MS. McKIEVER: Clearly to protect the money

20 potentially for retirement and -- and just as --

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, like setting up

22 a personal spendthrift trust?

23 MS. McKIEVER: That's --

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I want to make it tough so

25 that I -- I will not be tempted to withdraw. Is that the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 motivation?

2 MS. McKIEVER: Well, that would potentially be a

3 motivation because clearly the money is there readily

4 accessible at any time to -- to buy anything that the

5 debtor chooses throughout their life. So someone who's 30

6 or 40 years old can liquidate their -- their IRA account,

7 whereas with a pension or profit-sharing plan, they don't

8 have that kind of access --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: Should we put any weight on the

10 title, on the name? I mean, I -- I can't but thinking

11 it's an individual retirement account. Was Congress

12 trying to fool people?

13 (Laughter.)

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Was the Federal Trade

15 Commission? Should they investigate? What -- I mean, the

16 -- the -- I think of it as an account that's basically

17 aimed, at least Congress thought it was aimed, at

18 retirement, which has usually to do with age.

19 MS. McKIEVER: Well, the -- the name is clearly

20 not determinative.

21 Also, Congress in the -- in the --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm reading the statute and if

23 I were voting on it and put in the 408 reference and think

24 of the word individual retirement account, is there any --

25 I would have thought, knowing not that much about it, that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of course, they'd be included. Now, is there any

2 indication, when people passed this, that they didn't

3 think they would be? Any -- any reference in the terrible

4 words, legislative history, that might shed light on it?

5 MS. McKIEVER: Yes. First of all, Congress did

6 historically reject, first of all, just tax-favored status

7 overall, such as what an IRA account is. An IRA account

8 is set up just for tax-favored status. Congress set

9 forth, instead, the (d)(10)(e) -- 522(d)(10)(e)

10 requirements that -- that are much more stringent in the

11 requirements of the traditional IRA.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, are they? Because

13 there was one statement -- I think it was in Ms. Karlan's

14 brief -- that the Fifth Circuit said profit-sharing plans

15 permit participants to withdraw up to the entire amount on

16 payment of the penalty. So a profit-sharing plan, which

17 was one of the ones on the list, seems to be substantially

18 identical if you can also take out, whenever you like, as

19 long as you're willing to pay the penalty.

20 MS. McKIEVER: That's a misnomer that that's a

21 -- a right to payment. That is rather the right to borrow

22 as a loan. And a loan is very different than a right to

23 payment. They have the right to borrow the funds.

24 However -- for example, in the New York Police Department

25 pension plan, which she referenced in the reply brief, the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 police officers can borrow up to 90 percent of their

2 pension plan funds. However, they -- as long as they're

3 employed there, they have to continue to repay that.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what if they don't

5 repay it? What's the sanction?

6 MS. McKIEVER: There is a 10 percent penalty.

7 However, as the bankruptcy --

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: But what -- where -- where

9 would the -- where would the principal repayment come

10 from? I assume it would come from deducting whatever the

11 balance was from the -- the person's account.

12 MS. McKIEVER: That would be correct.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, we call it -- the --

14 the loan feature then boils down to a -- a withdrawal

15 subject to a periodic repayment obligation, but if that

16 obligation is not satisfied, the bottom line will be

17 exactly like a withdrawal because they will simply deduct

18 whatever the balance is from the person's rights under the

19 plan.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Plus 10 percent you say.

21 MS. McKIEVER: That's correct. However --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's just -- just like an

23 IRA.

24 MS. McKIEVER: But -- but this is in the

25 bankruptcy context, which makes it completely different.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 The bankruptcy filing of a chapter VII bankruptcy is a

2 picture in time. At the time that the debtor files the

3 bankruptcy petition, you look to the assets that the

4 debtor has possession of and the interest that the debtor

5 has at that moment. There's also, for some things, a 1-

6 year look-back period. But because it's a picture in

7 time, it's what the -- the debtor can reach is what the --

8 the bankruptcy trustee looks to, the types of assets that

9 -- that the debtor owns. This is very different than the

10 pension plan which, of course, the debtor could not have

11 -- have exhausted to pay the creditors prior to filing the

12 bankruptcy, but any other type of account would be there,

13 would be present at the retirement. But because they

14 could have liquidated their IRA's to pay off their

15 creditors prior to filing the bankruptcy, the bankruptcy

16 trustee steps into the shoes of that debtor and has the

17 ability to reach the funds that the debtor can potentially

18 reach.

19 There are other exemptions, of course, set forth

20 in -- in section 522(d), you know, for a home or jewelry,

21 but the assets that are not exempt are readily available

22 to repay creditors, for -- for the benefit of the

23 creditors. Therefore, that -- that makes it

24 significantly --

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Subject to the 10 percent if

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the bankruptcy trustee does that?

2 MS. McKIEVER: That's correct. That's correct.

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: The -- the penalty still has to

4 be paid even if it's the trustee who takes money out to

5 pay the creditors, on your view.

6 MS. McKIEVER: That's correct. Yes, they do.

7 They do.

8 Additionally, the petitioners' IRA's are -- by

9 allowing unfettered access, are unlike any of the other

10 plans because the petitioners' standard IRA is much more

11 like a savings account. It's not any form of deferred

12 compensation. They can't look to that to fill a salary

13 void after they retire because the money may not be there.

14 Unlike in the pension plans or a profit-sharing plan, they

15 could have liquidated those funds prior to their reaching

16 any age or any illness that -- that may befall them.

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there -- there is no

18 penalty attached to withdrawing from a savings account,

19 and there's also no limit on the annual contribution.

20 MS. McKIEVER: That's correct. That is correct.

21 That is correct.

22 But the -- the key here --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me just get -- get straight

24 what -- what the -- what the universe of plans we have in

25 front of us here. Do you assert that there are no other

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 plans, clearly covered by this statute, that permit

2 withdrawal for any reason but with a penalty?

3 MS. McKIEVER: That's correct. None of the

4 specified plans listed, the -- the ones enumerated.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would permit withdrawal for any

6 reason whatever provided that a penalty is paid.

7 MS. McKIEVER: That's correct.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: None of them is like that.

9 MS. McKIEVER: None of them is like that. They

10 all have specific factors. There has to be a causal

11 connection between the ability to access the money.

12 Additionally, it's very important that -- that

13 an account or plan that qualifies under the statute -- it

14 has to be determined on a case-by-case basis. And there's

15 no question that there are definitely IRA's that -- that

16 could and do qualify for this exemption. It is, instead,

17 that --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do -- do you disagree with

19 Ms. Karlan that this is -- this is a standardized product

20 so the people, the Rouseys of this world, really couldn't

21 get a tailor-made IRA? They would have to take the

22 standard product.

23 MS. McKIEVER: That's not -- that's not correct.

24 There are many customizable products that are -- are out

25 there. In fact, for example, when employers set up

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 different kinds of plans for their employees, they go and

2 they can choose from many different options. For example,

3 they can choose if they even have a -- a loan provision

4 built into a -- a 401(k) or a pension plan, just like the

5 IRA. They -- they can be customized because section 408

6 only sets forth the minimum requirements for it to qualify

7 for tax-favored status. That -- that is an Internal

8 Revenue Code section, and it does not in any way prohibit

9 additional factors being placed into the plan. Rather, it

10 allows the -- the individual or the employer because some

11 -- there are two different types of IRA's that can be set

12 up by an employer -- to go and customize those so that

13 they could potentially meet the statutory requirements.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: These -- these other plans that

15 allow you to withdraw for certain reasons but not for any

16 reason -- what happens if you withdraw for any reason?

17 MS. McKIEVER: That --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the sanction against --

19 I mean, you just go in. You withdraw the money for -- for

20 a reason that is not allowed by the employer plan. What

21 -- what is the sanction?

22 MS. McKIEVER: My understanding is that -- is

23 that you cannot access the funds for a reason not allowed

24 by those plans, that that is prohibited. And that -- that

25 is similar to Ms. Andersen's IRA in the Bankruptcy

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Appellate Panel case. She could no longer reach the funds

2 in the -- she could no longer reach the corpus of the

3 account. The -- the lump sum of money was there for her

4 retirement years. Whereas, in the IRA situation, the

5 money is not protected at any time. There's no

6 prohibition at all whatsoever on withdrawing the funds

7 from the account other than the payment of the penalty.

8 But whether an account or plan qualifies under

9 the statute, it -- it -- you look at the language of the

10 plan on a plan-by-plan basis. The petitioners' argument

11 renders the terms of the statute superfluous because,

12 first of all, it is dissimilar from the enumerated plans,

13 and secondly, it is not on account of any factors that the

14 money can be reached. The right to receive the payment is

15 not based upon any factor other than the -- the account

16 holder wanting to withdraw the funds.

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: The right to receive

18 100 percent is -- is dependent on a factor, isn't it?

19 MS. McKIEVER: Yes, it is.

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. At least as to the 10

21 percent that would be penalty, there's no right to get

22 that money unless you have a certain age.

23 MS. McKIEVER: That's correct. Unless you have

24 -- or another factor such as for education or for a home

25 loan, something like that. There are several different

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 reasons that you can -- you can reach the money and not

2 pay a penalty.

3 However, the penalty is not -- is not the

4 deciding factor. It's their ability to access the funds

5 at any time that -- that makes that a right of payment.

6 It's not a right of payment without a penalty. It's just

7 that the right to payment exists at all times.

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You don't dispute that --

9 that it's a very small percentage of people who have IRA's,

10 in fact, exercise the right to withdraw, given the penalty.

11 MS. McKIEVER: That -- that -- that is --

12 appears to be correct. I don't have those exact

13 statistics, but yes, that -- that appears to be correct,

14 that they have -- that they may not exercise that at -- in

15 great numbers.

16 First of all, going back to the causation factor

17 about the -- the ability of the debtors to withdraw the

18 funds for any reason or no reason, this Court in the 203

19 North LaSalle case determined that on account of must mean

20 because of, and that -- that is a key point here because

21 if the debtors can reach the funds for any reason, it is

22 not because of any other factor. And in the LaSalle case,

23 this Court found that that reading, the because of

24 reading, absolutely applies to this section of the -- the

25 Bankruptcy Code, that means that the result is that a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 direct causal connection is required between the right to

2 receive the payment in the on account of requirements. In

3 -- in this case there is no causal connection whatsoever

4 between the right to receive the payments and -- and any

5 of the factors enumerated in the statute.

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: The words, on account of, in

7 this -- this statute are sort of unusual, no matter how you

8 construe them, because really the payment is on account of

9 the years of service or it's on account of a lot of things.

10 You may become eligible at a certain time. It would be

11 better if it said a payment for which you became eligible

12 for one of these reasons because the payment isn't really on

13 account of all of these things. You may get the same amount

14 whether you're disabled or not depending on what the terms

15 of the plan are.

16 MS. McKIEVER: That's correct. There are, of

17 course, always some other factors, such as you have to

18 first deposit the money, you have to become eligible. But

19 once those barriers are passed, then -- then the right to

20 receive the payment has to be at least -- one of the

21 causes must be one of these factors. And it has to be

22 enumerated in the plan. It cannot be for any reason, but

23 must be an enumerated reason in the plan.

24 And the -- with the penalty, only the avoidance

25 of a penalty is based upon the -- the age of the debtor or

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the -- or any of the factors. It's -- section

2 522(d)(10)(e) is void of any reference to the tax status

3 or to the right to receive the payment without penalty.

4 It's only the right to receive the payment overall.

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does your argument draw a

6 ring around IRA's? It was suggested that if your argument

7 prevails, then these other plans would be affected as

8 well.

9 MS. McKIEVER: Only to the extent that -- that

10 they are not payable for any of the reasons enumerated in

11 the statute. If -- if they are available for payment at

12 any time for any reason, then -- then they would not

13 qualify. But the specified accounts, so long as they're

14 payable for -- for one of the factors and that there's a

15 direct nexus between the right to receive the payment and

16 -- and the factors, then -- then they would qualify for

17 the exemption. It is not, by any stretch, all IRA's. It

18 is just the types that -- currently that the petitioners

19 would have or that people would have that would allow the

20 access at any time for any purpose. So it's not that the

21 trustee is looking to have IRA's not be eligible for

22 exemption. It's just the types of accounts from which all

23 the funds can be withdrawn at any time for any purpose.

24 There are many qualifying IRA's that do exist,

25 that can exist. It's just that people have set these up

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 from standard plans allowing them access. Whether they

2 access the funds or not is not the key, but the ability to

3 access the money because it doesn't meet the statutory

4 requirements. There are several IRA's, though, that can

5 and do meet the statutory requirements. It's just that

6 the petitioners' don't.

7 The case law in the Eighth Circuit was well

8 settled, prior to the filing of this bankruptcy, that for

9 approximately 12 years, that the definition of similar

10 plan or contract did not include IRA's such as this, and

11 that the on account of factors had to be satisfied to

12 claim this exemption. The -- the debtors knew or -- or

13 potentially should have known that -- that their IRA's

14 were likely not exempt out of Eighth Circuit at the time

15 that they filed because of the way that -- that these had

16 been construed for a long period of time. So that they

17 could have set up accounts that did qualify for such

18 exemption, but -- but they did not restrict their access

19 in that way.

20 Thank you.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. McKiever.

22 Ms. Karlan, you have about 7 minutes. You're

23 not required to use it all.

24 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

25 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. KARLAN: I'm going to retire early.

2 (Laughter.)

3 MS. KARLAN: The -- the first point is that

4 there are two rights under IRA's: the right after age 59

5 and a half or upon death or disability or illness to

6 withdraw the money without any kind of penalty; and

7 there's a second little exercise, an entirely subsidiary

8 right, which is the ability to withdraw money subject to a

9 penalty earlier. The existence of that second entirely

10 subsidiary, almost never used right -- and the statistic

11 on this is in the green brief at page 23 -- means that the

12 real essence of an IRA is it is a plan on account of age.

13 The second point. As this Court said last

14 year --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't really have a right

16 to receive it on account of age. You have a right to

17 receive it without a penalty on account of age.

18 MS. KARLAN: Well, at the age of --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't the right to receive

20 the money that depends on your age. It's the right to

21 receive the money without paying a tax.

22 MS. KARLAN: Well, that's a right that's very

23 important because let me give you just a mathematical

24 example of the difference.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is a right that's important,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 but it's not what the statute says. The statute says --

2 MS. KARLAN: The statute gives that right.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the right to receive a

4 payment on account of, among other things, age.

5 MS. KARLAN: And you do have that right. You

6 also have another right. But the existence of that second

7 right doesn't negate the first right. The statute doesn't

8 here, for example, as section 522 or section 365 of the

9 Bankruptcy Code does, use the word solely to say you -- a

10 plan is eligible only if you have solely the right to

11 receive on this --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it lists the other

13 reasons: on account of illness, disability, death, age,

14 or length of service. And -- and, you know, when you have

15 a list like that, you would think that the right to

16 receive the money for some other reason doesn't -- doesn't

17 qualify. I mean, I would think that that's --

18 MS. KARLAN: That might be your first thought,

19 but then --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or -- or at least -- at least

21 some other reason that isn't closely related to those.

22 MS. KARLAN: Oh, but I think even if that were

23 your first thought, you would then get to the implication

24 that many of the Justices have been pressing today, which

25 is the implication of that for all plans is tremendous

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 because all plans give -- well, I shouldn't say all plans,

2 but I should say the vast majority of other plans, 401(k)

3 plans, profit-sharing plans, and the like, do give you

4 early access to your money, and that's valuable to you.

5 That's why in section --

6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is it true that none of them

7 give unfettered access? They're all qualified in some

8 fashion. Do you agree with that?

9 MS. KARLAN: Well, the qualification of hardship

10 has been interpreted by many employers to say, you want to

11 buy a house and you can't otherwise? That's a hardship.

12 You want to sent your kid to school and you can't

13 otherwise? That's a hardship. You have huge, you know,

14 consumer loans and you could consolidate that? That's a

15 hardship. So it's not as if IRA's operate differently

16 from everything else in the system. That's why --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, yes. You -- you don't

18 have to make up a hardship. You just say I want the

19 money. Okay, you want the money? Here's the money.

20 MS. KARLAN: I think that's --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't even have to lie about

22 the hardship. I mean --

23 (Laughter.)

24 MS. KARLAN: I need the money. I don't have the

25 money. That's a hardship. If you -- if all you have to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 say is the magic word hardship, I think that's why we

2 would say IRA's are similar plans or contracts because

3 this Court has made it clear similar is not the same thing

4 as identical. So if similar reasons allow you to

5 withdraw, that's enough.

6 And that's why in section --

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: In any of these other plans,

8 can you get the money so long as you're willing to pay a

9 penalty?

10 MS. KARLAN: As I read the New York City --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Without any qualification for

12 disability, illness. No. I just want the money. Give me

13 the money and I'll pay you 10 percent. Is there any plan

14 that works like that?

15 MS. KARLAN: I don't know, but the New York City

16 Police Department plan appears to work like that. You can

17 take the money out if you pay the 10 percent penalty.

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Has any judge ever taken the

19 view that -- adopting Justice Scalia's approach, that

20 while you can't put the whole IRA -- exempt the whole IRA,

21 but you can exempt 10 percent of it?

22 MS. KARLAN: Not to my knowledge.

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: At least you ought to get that

24 much, it seems to me, under his -- his analysis.

25 MS. KARLAN: We'd be happier with 10 percent

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 than nothing, but no judge has ever read the statute that

2 way.

3 The second point is a point that comes out of

4 this Court's decision last year in the Till case where the

5 Court said, look, you want to pick a manageable line, a

6 line that's straightforward and familiar. And here's one

7 that I'll give you that comes directly from the text of

8 section 522(d)(10)(e), which is you should hold that

9 section 522(d)(10)(e) permits the exemption of all plans

10 or contracts that qualify under section 401(a), section

11 403(a), section 403(b), or section 408 of the Internal

12 Revenue Code, which IRA's do.

13 And this may have led to some of the confusion,

14 I think, between counsel in this case, which is in the

15 Andersen case, although Ms. Andersen was receiving money

16 under section 408, it was not a 408 individual retirement

17 account. It was, instead, under section 403(b), an

18 individual retirement annuity. So there are, as far as we

19 know, no individual retirement accounts, the things you

20 put money into while the money accumulates before you're

21 ready to retire and you transfer it into an annuity that

22 are customizable.

23 And indeed, for the kinds of debtors who need

24 the protections of section 522(d)(10)(e) the most, the

25 unsophisticated people who are putting their money away in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 an IRA because their pension plan either doesn't exist at

2 all or isn't adequate for their retirement, the idea that

3 they would understand to go in and negotiate at a bank for

4 a customizable IRA strikes me as quite implausible.

5 That's why we think the most sensible reading of

6 the statute here is to exempt IRA's when the money in them
