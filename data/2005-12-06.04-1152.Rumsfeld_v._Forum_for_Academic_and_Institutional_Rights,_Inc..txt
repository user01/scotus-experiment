4 first this morning in Rumsfeld versus Forum for

5 Academic and Institutional Rights.

6 General Clement.

7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

8 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

9 GENERAL CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief

10 Justice, and may it please the Court:

11 The Solomon Amendment conditions the Federal

12 funding of educational institutions on receiving

13 something that any donor would expect, the opportunity

14 to recruit students educated at the funded

15 institutions. That opportunity allows the military a

16 fair shot at recruiting the best and the brightest for

17 the military's critical and vital mission.

18 The Federal Government does not insist on any

19 predetermined level of access; rather, it simply asks

20 what other employers receive. Likewise, the recipient

21 schools remain free to criticize the military and its

22 policies, and, of course, they remain free to decline

23 Federal funds altogether. As a result of these

24 circumstances, the Solomon Amendment comports with both

25 the Constitution and with common sense.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: When you say that it asks

2 what other employers receive, but these institutions, I

3 gather, would not allow other employers, who have the

4 same policy against the hiring of homosexuals, to

5 interview at their institutions. So, you're receiving

6 what other employers in the same situation would

7 receive.

8 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think, Justice

9 Scalia, that you have to look at the -- I think, the

10 statute in two steps. One is, I think it's quite clear

11 that it gives the military a right to gain access to

12 campus as a condition, that it has -- that they have to

13 gain access to campus in order to perform their

14 military recruitment.

15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but it says -- I

16 thought it says that the military must have equal

17 access with any other employer. Now, every other

18 employer is subject to the same policy, presumably, of

19 the law school.

20 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Justice

21 O'Connor, I think there's several points to be made in

22 response to that. First of all, I think the Solomon

23 Amendment itself is a recognition that the military is

24 not like any other employer for purposes of its policy

25 and its treatments of homosexuals. And I think that,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 unlike any other employer, the military's policy is a

2 result of a congressional mandate. And --

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's fine, but you

4 were the one that made the argument that they want the

5 same access as other employers. That's --

6 GENERAL CLEMENT: And what --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- when you -- I just --

8 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- what I would say --

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- want to make sure what

10 the calculus is, at the outset.

11 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and Justice Kennedy,

12 I think the point I would say is, in terms of gaining

13 access to campus, we want to gain access at a level,

14 and under circumstances, that perhaps some other

15 employer would be excluded. Well, once access is

16 gained, then the question arose under the prior version

17 of the statute, all right, if access is gained, what

18 level of access suffices? And on that second-order

19 question of what level of access suffices, then you

20 look to what is provided to any other employer. And

21 so, that's why, when I say that we don't ask for any

22 predetermined level, we don't ask for seven meetings a

23 year, we don't ask for entrance into the public-address

24 system or the e-mail system. We simply say, "Once you

25 let us on campus, just give us, and extend to us, an

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 opportunity to recruit on the same terms as others."

2 And that obviously reflects the commonsense judgment

3 that the military is competing for the same pool of

4 students that the other employers are competing for.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: The constitutional argument,

6 I guess, is, "Does the Constitution require access --

7 is -- does it permit a statute which says you have to

8 give access to the military, when you wouldn't give

9 access to any other employer?"

10 GENERAL CLEMENT: That's exactly right,

11 Justice Breyer.

12 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now --

13 GENERAL CLEMENT: And, of course, we take the

14 --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: So, then what you're saying,

16 it --

17 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- position that --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and then what's the

19 answer to that question, "Does the Constitution" -- how

20 does the -- what's the answer?

21 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think there's -- I mean,

22 there's -- the Constitution is -- has no difficulty

23 with such a statute. It is this statute. As I say,

24 there's -- if you want to think about it being

25 preferential entry into campus, and then, at that

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 point, equal access on terms of the -- the terms that

2 are extended -- however you want to think about it,

3 though, there's no difficult constitutional question

4 here.

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, your argument --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it seems me you've

7 got us off galloping in the wrong direction. The

8 statute doesn't require simply giving the same access

9 that you give to other employers. It requires much

10 more than that. It requires that they -- it prohibits,

11 or cuts off, funds if an institution either prohibits

12 or, in effect, prevents the Secretary of a military

13 department from gaining access to campuses for purposes

14 of military recruiting in a manner that is at least

15 equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses

16 and to students that is provided to any other employer.

17 So, it seems to me that the statute demands more than

18 simply you give the same access as all other employers.

19 If you allow any other employer, you have to give it

20 to the military in the same manner.

21 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's right,

22 Justice Scalia. I'm -- and I'm sorry if I got us off

23 on the wrong foot.

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General --

25 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think there is this

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 debate --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but it is an important

3 question, because the -- there is an amicus brief that

4 says, "Go read the statute." And, really, the statute

5 was not about homosexuals in the military, it was a

6 statute about universities in Vietnam not letting

7 military people on campus. So, in the -- at the heart

8 of the statute was a matter which was unique to the

9 military. Now, this is a matter that isn't unique to

10 the military. So, why not interpret the statute in the

11 way that the amicus brief suggests in order to avoid a

12 difficult constitutional question?

13 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, a couple of points,

14 Justice Breyer. I don't think there is a difficult

15 constitutional question to be avoided here, and I'll

16 get back to that whenever I can.

17 As to the statutory-interpretation question

18 itself, I think that in -- the proper frame of

19 reference here is probably not the original 1969

20 version of this, which conditioned only NASA's fund.

21 The original starting point is probably about 1996,

22 when the first version of the modern Solomon Amendment

23 was introduced. And there have been a couple of

24 iterations of it, but I think one important reference

25 point is the version that was in force at the start of

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 this litigation, and that's actually reproduced at page

2 88(a) of the petition appendix in the District Court

3 opinion. And if you look at that against 88(a) of the

4 petition appendix, there would be no question that what

5 is at stake here is access to the campus, and the

6 amicus argument that's being raised is not even

7 available; because the statute at that point is, I

8 think, in fairness, materially identical, except for

9 that last clause, which says "in a manner equal in

10 scope to -- in character to that of any other

11 institution." So, it's clear that when this litigation

12 starts, there's no argument available to the amicus

13 that the statute effectively accomplishes nothing.

14 Now, what happens under this version of the

15 statute is, a second-order question arises. Okay, the

16 -- in order to comply with the Solomon Amendment,

17 universities have to give access, they have to allow

18 the military to gain entry and gain access to the

19 students in the terms of the then-extant statute. The

20 --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt with one --

22 GENERAL CLEMENT: Sure.

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- brief question? Would

24 that be true if the university didn't allow any access

25 whatsoever to any employer?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 GENERAL CLEMENT: As a regulatory matter, the

2 military took the position that if they simply barred

3 access to --

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: No --

5 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- anybody --

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- not the regulatory

7 matter. The statute.

8 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think you could read the

9 statute either way on that question, Justice Stevens.

10 They interpreted it to say that there was no equal --

11 there is no obligation to give entry if no employer was

12 on campus at that time.

13 The other thing they interpreted in the

14 statute as a regulatory matter, though, was this

15 second-order question of, "All right, if they get some

16 access, is unequal access enough?" And as a regulatory

17 matter, they said, "No. We need access that is equal

18 in character and scope to that provided to any other

19 employer." And then what Congress did in the iteration

20 of the statute that's at issue here, which is

21 reproduced starting at page 185(a) of the petition

22 appendix is they effectively codified and ratified that

23 regulatory interpretation by adding the phrase "in a

24 manner that is at least as equal in quality and scope

25 to the access to campuses and to other students that is

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to -- provided to any other employer."

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General --

3 GENERAL CLEMENT: But I think --

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Clement, do I

5 understand, with respect to that brief that offered a

6 statutory interpretation to avoid a constitutional

7 question, your answer is, that would be an unreasonable

8 interpretation of the statute that we now have? And if

9 we're talking about a predecessor statute in 1968, from

10 the Vietnam days, that -- this would have been a highly

11 academic question, because there weren't any such

12 policies in any law schools with respect to recruiting.

13 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, that's true, Justice

14 Ginsburg. That's why I said, in response to Justice

15 Breyer, that I think that the proper point to start to

16 focus on is the -- these -- is the 1994 Solomon

17 Amendment. And, at that point, there is a question

18 about this policy. At that point, the American

19 Association of Law Schools does have its recruiting

20 policies beginning in place, and I think the provision

21 has been amended a number of times in the years since

22 1994. There have been changes in the scope of the

23 funding that's covered. First, student-aid funds were

24 put in, then they were taken out. And then, this is

25 the most recent iteration of the provision.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 There's no question that what's at issue here

2 is more than just the Vietnam-era concerns about ROTC

3 presence on statute, because that's addressed in a

4 different subsection of the statute. That's addressed

5 in 10 U.S.C. 983(a). So this provision, 10 90- -- 10

6 U.S.C. 983(b) is specifically addressed at the problem

7 of access to campuses for recruiting. And, I think,

8 especially when you read the statute in light of the

9 relevant history of the prior administrative

10 interpretation, and that being codified and ratified by

11 Congress, it's very clear that this phrase "in a manner

12 that is at least equal in quality and scope to the

13 access provided to any other employer," is just that,

14 it's a regulation of the manner of access, once access

15 is granted. And it addresses this difficult question

16 of, If you allow some entry and access onto campus,

17 what level of access is sufficient? And so, I think

18 that --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does Title X of the

20 United States Code deal with?

21 GENERAL CLEMENT: It deals with the military.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you chose to defend

23 this principally on the basis of the Spending Clause,

24 and not on the basis of what it -- what it was, seemed

25 to me, enacted in order to achieve, and that is the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 congressional power to raise and support armies.

2 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I

3 think the statute is clearly supported under both

4 provisions, under the spending authority and the

5 Article I authority to raise and support armies. I

6 think, in answering your question, we tended to focus

7 on the fact that it was a spending condition, because

8 we thought, under this Court's precedence, that made it

9 an even more straightforward case. We certainly think

10 it would be constitutional, even if it were a direct

11 imposition, and we certainly think the fact that this

12 is an exercise of Congress's undoubted authority to

13 raise and support an army, is relevant to the

14 constitutional analysis.

15 And if I could move over to the

16 constitutional question and address that for a minute,

17 I think one of the arguments that's raised on the other

18 side is that there's an interference with associational

19 interests in this case, and I think there are other

20 statutes that, frankly, have much more of an

21 interference with a university's associational

22 interest. I mean, Title VII, for example, regulates

23 who can be members of the university. And I raise that

24 also because another provision in Title -- in terms of

25 this same area of the military, requires that there not

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 be discrimination against veterans in hiring and

2 employment. And you could easily see that a university

3 could take their position to its logical conclusion and

4 say, "In order to show just how much we don't like the

5 military's policy, we're not only going to not let

6 military recruiters on campus, but we are going to not

7 hire former military people, veterans, and we're not

8 going to admit them to our classes." Now, who's in the

9 classroom, and who's a member of the university --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would --

11 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- seems --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- be rather farfetched.

13 The pitch that's being made is an equality pitch, that

14 we are teaching our students equality, the equal

15 stature of all people. So, I think that your example

16 does not fit --

17 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Justice

18 Ginsburg, I'm not sure I understand why not. It's the

19 same idea. In order to teach equality, that there

20 should be no discrimination against homosexuals, we're

21 going to exclude, (a), military recruiters, and, while

22 we're at it, the former military, as well, because they

23 voluntarily joined the forces knowing that they had a

24 discriminatory practice. It's no stretch of the

25 imagination to think that the principle that's being

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 articulated by Respondents, would stretch well beyond

2 simply a direct antidiscrimination motive.

3 For example, NYU -- this is in the joint appendix,

4 at page 153 -- NYU, for 3 years, had a policy of

5 excluding recruiters from the State of Colorado, simply

6 because Colorado had passed Amendment II, which this

7 Court dealt with in the Romer case. And so, it's not a

8 matter of saying that, "Well, you know, the only think

9 that's at issue here is excluding employers that are,

10 themselves, discriminatory." The free-speech interests

11 that are articulated on the other side, would extend to

12 any basis for criticizing the military, whether it was

13 not liking the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, or

14 the discriminatory hiring policies.

15 I also think, with respect to the issue of

16 discrimination, it's worth pointing out here that

17 there's more than one way to understand whether or not

18 the military's policy is discriminatory. Certainly

19 respondents are entitled to view it as being

20 discriminatory. But the Congress that mandates this

21 same policy towards homosexuals, I think, is equally

22 entitled to look at it and say, "No, there's no

23 discrimination going on here, because you have to take

24 into account the special role of the military."

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but even if you do

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that, you're still left, it seems to me, with the

2 problem -- whether you characterize the problem as

3 discriminatory and antidiscriminatory university policy

4 or not, you're still left with a speech problem that

5 they raise, that, in effect, you are forcing them, in

6 effect, to underwrite your speech, up to a point, and

7 you are forcing them to change their own message.

8 You're forcing them into hypocrisy, in one alternative.

9 And those arguments don't depend upon the -- sort of,

10 the discriminatory character of what may be at stake.

11 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's exactly

12 right Justice Souter, and I think those arguments would

13 be the same even if what was going on here was a

14 concern about the military's other policies. You would

15 still have a concern that the military is being forced

16 onto campus to make its own speech, and you would still

17 have the concern that that interferes with the message

18 --

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, discrimination --

20 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- the university --

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- or no discrimination,

22 you've got a speech issue that you're going to address.

23 GENERAL CLEMENT: I agree. I mean, I think,

24 ultimately, that cuts in our favor, because it shows

25 that the other side's position is not limited to this

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 narrow context, but is a much broader first-amendment

2 claim.

3 Now, turning to that first-amendment claim, I

4 think what's wrong with that claim is several things.

5 I think, with respect to what the military itself

6 wants, it simply does not want a -- primarily a speech

7 activity to take place, it wants access for recruiting,

8 which is a traditional commercial enterprise, it is an

9 activity that is something that is regulated by Title

10 VII in other Federal statutes. Sure, there may be some

11 incidental speech involved in that, but primarily it is

12 an instrumental activity designed to get --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: It happens, in this case, to

14 be specifically authorized by the Constitution.

15 GENERAL CLEMENT: It does, indeed, Justice

16 Scalia, and I think, though -- I mean, there is this

17 sense in which we certainly concede that there maybe

18 some incidental speech involved; certainly,

19 military recruiters are engaged in speech. I'm --

20 we're not sure that's really the relevant speech. But

21 even the university itself --

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're making a --

23 if I understand what you're saying, you are making a

24 kind of O'Brien argument that the -- that the burden on

25 speech, whatever it may be, is an incidental burden to

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 something else. Well, that -- I think we have to draw

2 this line between recruiting, on the one hand, which is

3 what the military wants to do, and the Solomon

4 Amendment, on the other hand. As I understand it, the

5 Solomon Amendment is directed, or is responsive,

6 entirely to positions taken by law schools on, among

7 other things, first-amendment expressive grounds, so

8 that if we are going to address the Solomon Amendment,

9 I think we are addressing an exclusively first-

10 amendment-speech expression issue.

11 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, I

12 guess -- I'm inferring that you're drawing that

13 conclusion from some of the statements of some of the

14 floor sponsors about their purposes enacting the

15 Solomon Amendment. I mean, if you look at the text of

16 the Act alone --

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't --

18 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- I don't think --

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- know of any other reason

20 for the Solomon Amendment.

21 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think the reason

22 for the Solomon Amendment is to ensure that military

23 recruiters, in fact, have an equal opportunity to

24 recruit the same pool of individuals that all the other

25 employers are trying --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: But --

2 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- to recruit.

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: But they're -- but the

4 Solomon Amendment, in order to accomplish that, is

5 addressed to a particular expressive problem which

6 occurs for the military -- and for the law schools, for

7 that matter -- in law-school recruiting. So, it seems

8 to me that -- for -- I mean, my only point is that the

9 Solomon Amendment seems to have one objective.

10 Whereas, the "don't burn your draft-card rule," in

11 O'Brien, had two -- or had a -- let's say, had a

12 primarily nonspeech objective with an incidental-speech

13 burden. Here, the sole objective, in the real world,

14 seems to be an expressive objective.

15 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, if by -- "the

16 expressive objective" you're talking about is the

17 military's own recruiting, I guess --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, this express --

19 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- I agree with you.

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the expressive

21 objective is, the law schools are taking a position on

22 first-amendment grounds. That position is interfering

23 with military recruitment. No question about it. I

24 don't know how much, but I will assume that there is no

25 question about it. The Solomon Amendment is addressed

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 solely, as I understand it, at the expressive

2 activities which have, as you say, this interference.

3 Its sole objective is expressive.

4 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, I would disagree,

5 Justice Souter. If the -- if the law schools were

6 denying access to military recruiters, for any reason,

7 be it a first-amendment reason that they'd say it's a

8 first-amendment reason, or just because they couldn't

9 be bothered, the Solomon Amendment would be written

10 exactly the same way, which would say, "Look, the

11 military has an opportunity to get onto campus, and,

12 once it gets there, it ought to get the same basic

13 opportunities as other employers."

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: You cannot convert a law

15 into a law directed at the first -- at first-amendment

16 rights, can you, by simply saying, "The reason I am

17 disobeying it is to express -- whatever, disaffection

18 with the war, my objection to homosexuality, or

19 anything else -- or to homosexual discrimination -- or

20 anything else"? Does that convert it to a law directed

21 against the first amendment?

22 GENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely not, Justice

23 Scalia. And I would go further and say it's also not a

24 problem, if, in the real world, the conduct that

25 Congress sought to regulate was, in fact, in practice,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 generated by first-amendment concerns. I think that

2 describes O'Brien.

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in --

4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let me ask another

5 question that may shed a little light on it. Does the

6 Solomon Amendment pose any restrictions on the extent

7 to which the law schools can distance themselves from

8 the military's views? Can there be signs up at every

9 recruitment office, saying, "Our law school doesn't

10 agree with any discrimination against gays"? I mean,

11 can they come forward with their position on this in

12 every recruitment office without violation of the

13 amendment?

14 GENERAL CLEMENT: Yes, they can, Justice

15 O'Connor. I think they would be, in fairness -- I want

16 to be clear -- I think there might be a line where

17 there would be -- the recruitment office could conduct

18 itself in a way that would effectively deny access.

19 But I think, with that caveat, there is --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: But --

21 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- nothing in the Act that

22 prevents the universities --

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you --

24 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- from disclaiming --

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question, to follow

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 up on Justice O'Connor's thought. Can -- are you

2 saying that the school can engage in speech expressing

3 its views about the military policies, can it engage in

4 symbolic speech by affording access, which is equal in

5 all functional requirements, but yet sends a message

6 that they are really disagreeing with what's going on

7 by, say -- let a law school say, "Well, for -- most

8 employers will let you use the regular law-school

9 placement facilities, but, for the military, we will

10 require you use the college facilities to send a

11 message that we disapprove, if the college facility is

12 equally of -- good, as a matter of functioning"?

13 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I

14 would say, to the -- I think, the main thrust of your

15 question, no, which is to say that if what you have in

16 mind is really forcing them to go to the undergraduate

17 campus, I think the military would take the position

18 that that's not equal in scope. Now, if there's a way,

19 though --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: But is it not equal because

21 of the message it sends or because it denies the

22 opportunity to recruit as effectively?

23 GENERAL CLEMENT: It's the latter, Justice

24 Stevens, and only the latter --

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: What if I had an example

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 where they were equal -- equally effective as

2 recruitment avenues. Could they -- could they make the

3 military take one that was equally effective, but it

4 sent a message, "Well, we really don't like what you're

5 doing"?

6 GENERAL CLEMENT: I mean, my own --

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sort of like a

8 separate-but-equal.

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

10 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean --

11 [Laughter].

12 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- I guess I'm -- I'm

13 resisting a little bit just because I'm not -- I think

14 it would depend on the --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: So, the --

16 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- hypothetical.

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- the point I'm trying to

18 make is, Does your agreement, that you can engage in

19 speech by posting banners or handing a note, apply to

20 symbolic speech --

21 GENERAL CLEMENT: It could --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- the kind of conduct that

23 is symbolic speech?

24 GENERAL CLEMENT: It could apply to some

25 symbolic speech, I believe. It's just -- I'm having

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 trouble, because, in a practical matter, if you look at

2 the record here, I think it's telling. If you look, at

3 joint appendix, at pages 215 and 219, describes the

4 real situation at Boston College. And they want to say

5 that, "Well, it's not really much of an imposition on

6 the military, because all you have to do is get the

7 recruiting list from the reserve desk at the law

8 library, and then go to" --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, that's a functional --

10 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- the main campus, which

11 is a mile and a half away.

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the --

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's a functional

14 difference.

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the resistance to any

16 statute, I assume, could be justified as symbolic

17 speech.

18 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and I think -- I

19 mean, I'm -- I think that some resistance by some parts

20 of the university might be fine. I think if the

21 recruiting office -- this is the caveat I tried to give

22 Justice O'Connor -- if the recruiting office engages in

23 conduct that effectively negates the access that

24 they're providing, then I think you would have a

25 different situation.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, can you

2 be affirmative now? Because we have an example, from

3 Justice Stevens, which is the Yale example. The -- it

4 was the main campus, instead of the law school. What -

5 - the recruiter is there. He's in the same room that

6 other recruiters use. What can the law faculty do to

7 disassociate itself from -- to say that, "We don't

8 tolerate discrimination of any kind"? What can the law

9 school do, concretely, while the recruiter is in the

10 room?

11 GENERAL CLEMENT: I mean, concretely, they

12 could put signs on the bulletin board next to the door,

13 they could engage in speech, they could help organize

14 student protests. I would draw the line, though, at

15 saying that they have to go to the undergraduate

16 campus, because I think, as a practical matter --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean, they could

18 organize a student protest at the hiring interview

19 rooms, so that everybody jeers when the applicant comes

20 in the door and the school could organize that?

21 GENERAL CLEMENT: The school could --

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: As -- when it's --

23 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- organize --

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- when it's, say, a job

25 fair, and all the employers are there, but then they

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 jeer just the -- and the school organizes a line

2 jeering the -- both the recruiters and the applicants,

3 that's equal access?

4 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think that would be equal

5 access. I think you have to draw a practical line --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm surprised that --

7 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- here between --

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you think that --

9 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- between access and

10 allowing the speech, but I think it -- you have to be -

11 -

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're not going to be an

13 Army recruiter, are you?

14 [Laughter.]

15 GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think the military

16 and the Army recruiters -- and I -- and I won't be one

17 of them -- but I think the Army recruiters are not

18 worried about being confronted with speech, they're

19 worried about actually not being allowed onto the same

20 law schools --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: They're worried about having

23 students driven off. And if you have jeering and

24 picketing, do you really think that that fulfills the

25 purposes of this amendment?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't know if it would

2 fulfill every purpose, but I think the amendment has to

3 accommodate the first-amendment --

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think if you --

5 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- interests at --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- have jeering --

7 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- a university.

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- jeering and picketing if

9 a black person came to recruit and people didn't -- and

10 a school faculty didn't like blacks?

11 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think that would --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that that's an

13 extraordinary position you're taking.

14 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, but, Justice Kennedy,

15 I think you have to distinguish what the Constitution

16 would allow the Government to do and what this statute

17 does, which is to say -- I mean, what you have in mind

18 is a --

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We're talking --

20 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- race example --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- about the practical

22 meaning of "equal access."

23 GENERAL CLEMENT: Right, but in -- the

24 practical meaning has to turn on the statute at issue.

25 And Title VI, for example, in the race context,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 forbids all discrimination because of race. And so,

2 some of the conduct that you have in mind may well

3 violate that statute. And if Congress wants to write a

4 different statute that provides more rights to the

5 military, we would be here defending it as valid first-

6 amendment legislation. But this statute gives, not a

7 right to be free of any discrimination, but a right to

8 equal access. And we think that the right way to frame

9 that inquiry is say, "Access, yes, but be respectful of

10 speech."

11 And the last thing I would say, if I could

12 reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal, is simply

13 that it's worth remembering that the recruiting office

14 is not the heart of first-amendment activity on campus.

15 And if the recruiting office acts in a way that

16 ensures access, and the rest of the university engages

17 in speech, that's a common sense way to accommodate the

18 interest of the military recruiters and the first

19 amendment.

20 If I may reserve.

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.

22 Mr. Rosenkranz, we'll hear now from you.

23 ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

24 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor. Mr.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

2 This case is not about whether military

3 recruiters will be barred at the campus gates.

4 Congress had a law on the books that guaranteed entry

5 to campus, but that was not what Congress really

6 wanted. So, it passed a new law. What Congress really

7 wants is to squelch even the most symbolic elements of

8 the law schools' resistance to disseminating the

9 military's message, which is why it gave us the current

10 version of the statute. The current version isolates

11 for regulation the most communicative aspects of the

12 law schools' resistance. The law schools --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's --

14 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- -- are saying --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, but the

16 most communicative aspect is saying what you think

17 about a particular policy. This is conduct, denying

18 access to the military recruiters.

19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, this is a

20 refusal to disseminate the messages of the military

21 recruiters. It is a refusal to send e-mails, post

22 bulletins, and make arrangements for mutual exchange of

23 ideas. It is "conduct" only in the sense that they are

24 moving molecules, but it's speech that they are being

25 forced to engage in. And I have to emphasize, this

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 case is not about entry. The Solomon Amendment does

2 not require schools to give entry to military

3 recruiters, it requires them to give entry to a

4 recruiter only if they provide entry to some --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no that --

6 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- other employer.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if you had a

8 policy that, "We're going to deny any employer that

9 uses tanks," do you think that would pass muster under

10 the Solomon Amendment?

11 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, for a

12 pacifist religious institution, absolutely.

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about Yale Law

14 School?

15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, because it has no

16 morally-based, conscious-driven reason for refusing to

17 disseminate that message.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, where do you find that?

19 In -- it has to be a morally-based, conscience-driven

20 --

21 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought we were talking

23 about freedom of speech, not the religion clauses.

24 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, what I'm

25 saying is, under the -- under this Court's

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 jurisprudence in the first amendment, it's actually

2 relevant whether the reason for refusing to disseminate

3 the message lies at the heart of the first amendment.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is -- what about

5 Hurley? Is there something deeply moral or conscience-

6 driven about the position to exclude the gay-rights

7 contingent in the parade, in Hurley?

8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, it was

9 certainly a reason that they gave, and it was based

10 upon a political view of the legitimacy of

11 homosexuality.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, you're --

13 MR. ROSENKRANZ: But I hasten to add, I'm not

14 arguing that that is a required element of a compelled-

15 speech claim. I'm simply arguing that when someone has

16 a reason for resisting disseminating a message, that

17 situates it further -- closer to the heart of the first

18 amendment. Congress came back, after it --

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --

20 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- had a --

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Excuse me, that -- I

22 understand that, so far as the associational claim may

23 go. But so far as the speech claims may go, I don't

24 understand it.

25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: I can say, or refuse to say,

2 anything I want to, for any reason I want to, however

3 bad that reason, however nonmoral that reason is. And

4 I don't see how, in the speech -- on the speech claims,

5 we get into moral basis at all.

6 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I accept that as

7 a proposition of the compelled-speech doctrine,

8 absolutely. And what I'm trying to point out is that

9 in this case what Congress has done is to engage in the

10 most viewpoint-oriented regulation of speech. The

11 reason Congress does not -- the reason Congress is

12 insisting that the law schools disseminate the

13 recruiting messages is because of the message of the

14 law --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it doesn't --

16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- schools themselves --

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it doesn't insist

18 --

19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- in providing --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't insist

21 that you do anything. It says that, "If you want our

22 money, you have to let our recruiters on campus."

23 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, and, under

24 the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, the

25 analysis is exactly the same.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under -- what about

2 South Dakota against Dole? South Dakota had a

3 constitutional right, under the twenty-first amendment,

4 to set whatever drinking age it wanted, and yet we

5 upheld the Spending Clause condition that if they

6 accepted Federal funds, they had to set their drinking

7 age at 21.

8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. And in

9 subsequent cases -- and, in fact, in Dole itself --

10 this Court pointed out that all bets are off when there

11 is a superseding constitutional right. Here, we're

12 talking about the Bill of Rights and the first

13 amendment. I mean, Rosenberger and Rust --

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's the right to

15 -- in the Constitution, to raise a military.

16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, that is a Government

17 interest, for sure. All Government interests --

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What --

19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- can be --

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What you're --

21 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- traced --

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What you're arguing is that

23 what is, for all intents and purposes, "conduct" can be

24 infused by the school, at its option, with a first-

25 amendment quality. Yet your argument would allow

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 schools to exclude anybody in uniform from a cafeteria.

2 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Absolutely not, Your Honor,

3 because --

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why not?

5 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- because --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the point?

7 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- what the law schools are

8 engaging in --

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's an express -- it's an

10 -- it's solely for an expressive purpose.

11 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, there's a

12 difference between refusing to abide by a universally

13 applicable regulation of conduct, on the one hand, and

14 the Solomon on -- Amendment, on the other hand, which

15 is refusing to assist the dissemination of a message.

16 Recruiting is all about speech. Yes --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you --

18 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- it has --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you do about the --

20 about the cases where we have required colleges to

21 allow some student activities to put forward their

22 views on campus, when other student activities are

23 allowed to do that? It seems to me that that flatly

24 contradicts the proposition that when you compel an

25 institution to permit somebody else to speak, you are

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 violating that institution's first-amendment rights.

2 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, that is

3 for public schools, and public schools are subject to

4 the first-amendment rights of those who want to enter

5 their forum. But there is a critical difference

6 between that forum, Your Honor, which the schools

7 opened up to everyone, and the forums in career

8 services, which the schools filter on the basis of one

9 very important --

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but, Mr. Rosenkranz,

11 isn't the -- I thought the distinction was that in

12 determining the forum for recruiting, the university is

13 speaking. The university isn't creating a forum from a

14 lot -- for a lot of third parties; it's speaking,

15 itself. And I understand the essence of your claim to

16 be that its speech is being affected, either by being

17 mixed with something it doesn't want to say or by

18 being, in effect, forced to support it doesn't --

19 something it does not want to say.

20 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it's important

21 to keep in mind that there are two messages going on

22 here, and they are clashing. There is the military's

23 message, which the schools are interpreting as, "Uncle

24 Sam does not want you," and there is the school's

25 message, which is, "We do not abet those who

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 discriminate. That is immoral." And --

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you would take, Mr.

3 Rosenkranz, that same position. If this was not

4 special to law faculties -- I mean, we're told that the

5 recruiters could go to the main campus; most of these

6 places, the restriction is limited to the law

7 faculties. Suppose it was universitywide policy that

8 we do not give equal access to military recruiters. I

9 think your argument says it doesn't matter if it's

10 special to the law school or the whole university. Do

11 I understand it correctly?

12 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. If the

13 university had such a policy, then the university would

14 be able to enforce it. But I hasten to add --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so for members --

16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- the university --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- for medical schools, we

18 can't get medical schools for our Armed Forces --

19 chaplains, the same way, because it -- schoolteachers

20 who teach on military bases -- in order to make the

21 point.

22 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, at this point,

23 and for some --

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's --

25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- several --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's all for an

2 expressive reason.

3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Justice Kennedy, for several

4 decades, law schools have had these policies and

5 applied them to career-services offices. No other

6 schools within the --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: But that isn't --


8 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But --


9 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- universities. 


10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- that isn't relevant. 


11 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But the Government takes 


12 the position that the law school is entirely free to

13 convey its message to everyone who comes.

14 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Justice O'Connor, and -

15 -

16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So, how is the message

17 affected --

18 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well --

19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- in that environment?

20 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- let me answer in two

21 parts. First, of course, under the compelled-speech

22 cases, the ability to protest the forced message is

23 never a cure for compelled-speech violation, but --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But --

25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- what's going on --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, but, on

2 compelled speech, nobody thinks that these -- law

3 school is speaking through those employers who come

4 onto its campus for recruitment. Everybody knows that

5 those are the employers. Nobody thinks the law school

6 believes everything that the employers are doing or

7 saying.

8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That's correct, Your Honor,

9 but, again, endorsement is also not an element of

10 compelled-speech claim. But let me -- let me bring

11 those two questions together on a factual point. The

12 law schools are disseminating a message that they

13 believe it is immoral to abet discrimination. When --

14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But --

15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- they --

16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- they can say that to

17 every student who enters the room.

18 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And when they do it, Your

19 Honor, the answer of the students is, "We don't believe

20 you. We read your message as being that there are two

21 tiers. There's a" --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, there are --

23 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- "double standard" --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: -- students --

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The reason they don't

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 believe you is because you're willing to take the

2 money. What you're saying is, "This is a message" --

3 [Laughter.]

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- "we believe in

5 strongly, but we don't believe in it, to the tune of

6 $100 million."

7 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That's right, Your Honor.

8 And the problem with this Solomon Amendment is that the

9 unconstitutional-conditions doctrine says that you

10 can't put a private speaker to that crisis of

11 conscience.

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just be sure I have

13 one thing straight? The content of the compelled

14 speech, as I understand it, is you're aiding in the

15 recruitment of the Armed Forces, right?

16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That's correct --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: And so, it --

18 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- Your Honor.

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- would still have been

20 compelled speech if, 25 years ago, Congress passed a

21 statute saying, "University, you must allow our people

22 on campus to recruit," and they some -- for some

23 reason, didn't want to help. But that would have been

24 a violation of the first amendment of the school if

25 there were no other debate, just they didn't want the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Army on because they had to provide facilities that

2 would aid recruitment.

3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. If it was

4 -- certainly, if it was against their conscience to do

5 so --

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: So that it would have

7 violated the first amendment during World War II when

8 the -- whenever they are trying to raise an army, if

9 they had compelled an unwilling university to provide

10 recruitment facilities to the military.

11 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, yes, Your Honor,

12 unless there is a compelling need. And the difficulty

13 with the Solomon Amendment --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that be compelled

15 speech, though, in your view. That's the kind of

16 speech we're talking about, anything that helps the

17 military raise an army.

18 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Anything that -- not

19 anything that helps the military raise an army; any

20 communication that a school is required to engage in.

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: So, why isn't --

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that the point? I

24 mean, your point is not that -- as I understand, that,

25 for any reason, if the -- if the university, for any

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 reason, during World War II, had excluded recruiters,

2 and there had been the equivalent of the Solomon

3 Amendment, that there would have been a first-amendment

4 problem. As I -- is -- maybe I don't understand your

5 argument, but I thought your argument was, or is, that

6 if they do it for some purpose of conscience, which

7 implies a message -- e.g., if it is a pacifist college

8 -- there would be a first-amendment problem. But if

9 they're doing it simply because space is short and they

10 would rather provide one more biology classroom, there

11 wouldn't be a first-amendment problem, World War II or

12 today, would there?

13 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That is absolutely right --

14 correct, Justice Souter, which is why I answered your

15 very early question with --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you --

17 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- an answer that is --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- are saying that --

19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- by conscience --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that every time somebody

21 gives as his reason for violating a law that he wants

22 to send a message that he disagrees with that law --

23 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that raises a first-

25 amendment question.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. Every time

2 --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --

4 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- someone says that as a

5 reason for refusing to host a message of an unwelcome

6 messenger, that's a compelled-speech violation.

7 JUSTICE BREYER: So, in fact, to be clear,

8 you also think schools that are angry at the military

9 because they're too favorable to gays in the military,

10 they have the same right.

11 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Absolutely, Your --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

13 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- Honor, because --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: And also the same right Bob

15 Jones University, because they disapprove of social

16 mixing of the races?

17 MR. ROSENKRANZ: If -- to answer the first

18 hypothetical first, if that's a matter of conscience,

19 absolutely --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, so --

21 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- if we're talking --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: -- so, what -- and there are

23 a lot of people in the country, they may -- there's

24 few, anyway -- may not believe in either affirmative

25 action, they may not believe in -- they may not believe

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in diversity, they may not -- they may even believe in

2 racial segregation, for all I know. I hope there are

3 not too many --

4 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: -- but there might, and

6 those people all have the same right.

7 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, they have the same

8 first-amendment right.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay. So, if that --

10 MR. ROSENKRANZ: But --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: -- if that's the case, then

12 of course it's going to be pretty tough --

13 MR. ROSENKRANZ: But, Your Honor, the --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: -- for the military to get

15 people on campus. And I just wonder, if that's an

16 important need, why you don't have here what I'd say is

17 normal in the first-amendment area, that the remedy for

18 speech you don't like, is not less speech, it is more

19 speech.

20 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the problem with

21 the Solomon Amendment is that the Government is

22 demanding absolute parity. We have a statute before us

23 that demands exactly the same services, without regard

24 to whether the military actually needs them. In order

25 for Congress to justify the parity requirement, which

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 is the only statute before this Court, Congress has to

2 state a need. It has to say why it needs what --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Here's a need. How about

4 this? We have said in our opinions -- and I am quoting

5 from Rostker versus Goldberg -- "Judicial deference is

6 at its apogee when legislative action under the

7 congressional authority to raise and support armies and

8 make rules and regulations for their governance is

9 challenged." And that's precisely what we have here.

10 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, this Court

11 defers to Congress, in matters of the military, when

12 the military or the Congress is especially expert and

13 this Court is especially naive. This Court has never

14 deferred to a congressional statute about military when

15 --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it has to do

17 with expertise. I think it has to do with immense

18 national importance.

19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it has to do

20 with expertise, as well. That's precisely what this

21 Court --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: But I would --

23 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- said in Rostker.

24 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I would like the answer

25 to my question, because I'm thinking, as you correctly

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 say, if you have that right, so do all the worse

2 segregationists you can imagine, et cetera.

3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And the --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: And here -- yes, and here

5 there is a need of some kind to get the military in.

6 And what the Government in this statute asks you --

7 because I, personally, couldn't find anything in the

8 record that finds that student who thinks, by letting

9 the military person in, that that school, which

10 basically is completely against the military in this

11 area, suddenly becomes for it. And I haven't even

12 found in the record an instance where there was a

13 recruiter who told people that they couldn't join the

14 military if they were gay.

15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: So, we have not a tremendous

17 demonstration there of a need on the university side.

18 And my question was, What's wrong with the Government

19 saying, "University, you disapprove of what we do. The

20 remedy for such a situation is not less speech, it is

21 more speech."

22 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: Go and explain it.

24 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- the direct answer to that

25 last question is that all bets are off when what the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Government is doing is compelling the speech of a

2 private actor, because the Government is not allowed --

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does it compel the speech

4 of a private actor when the Government says, "Colleges

5 and Universities, you are not going to get Federal

6 money if you discriminate on grounds of race or gender.

7 And we don't care what your private attitude may be,

8 we will refuse to contract, we will debar you from

9 future contracts, if you don't -- not only say, 'We

10 won't discriminate,' but have an affirmative action

11 plan." You know that is not hypothetical. This was

12 the U.S. policy in the early '70s.

13 GENERAL CLEMENT: Yes, Your Honor. I

14 understand the hypothetical, at least -- especially as

15 to the first half, which links to Justice Breyer's

16 earlier question. There is an enormous difference,

17 under this Court's jurisprudence, between

18 antidiscrimination laws and the sort of law we have

19 here, the Solomon Amendment. And the difference is,

20 the Government -- it is both on the need side and on

21 the infringement side. On the need side, the

22 Government has a compelling interest that is different

23 from just regulating the conduct. The compelling

24 interest that the Government has is a completely

25 separate interest in seeing to it that not a penny of

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Federal money ever goes to support an institution that

2 taxpayers would not be in a position to go to. That's

3 Bob Jones and Norwood.

4 And, on the infringement side, this Court has

5 said, that the act of discriminating against

6 individuals is entitled to no first-amendment

7 protection, regardless of whether there's a first-

8 amendment right at stake. And I should add, also, that

9 the vast majority of schools that are subject to Title

10 VI or to Title IX have no such expression that is at

11 stake. They are not articulating a message, "We really

12 need to discriminate on the basis of race or on the

13 basis of gender."

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Rosenkranz, could you

15 tell me which elements of your argument rest upon

16 compelled actual speech and which rest upon compelled

17 symbolic speech? Because the latter, I have to tell

18 you, I'm not very fond of. What compelled actual

19 speech is imposed on the -- you mentioned something

20 about e-mails, they have to send e-mails to say where

21 the recruiter will be located --

22 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- is that the compelled

24 speech you're worried about?

25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: It is -- Your Honor, it is

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the forced hosting of a messenger-based decision --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's symbolic

3 speech. I'm talking about actual speech. What

4 expression is the university -- real, you know, words -

5 - words -- is the --

6 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, but --

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- university --

8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- with the --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- compelled to utter by

10 this legislation?

11 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Under the parity

12 requirement, what the university is compelled to do is

13 sit down with the employers and help counsel them on

14 what their students are interested in and how best to

15 shape the message. The Third Circuit went out of its

16 way to point out that, and the National Association for

17 Law Placement brief is very compelling on that. They

18 also have to disseminate literature, post bulletins on

19 bulletin boards, help the recruiter -- or, excuse me,

20 the law firm develop cocktail parties --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I suppose when you --

22 when the police knock at the door and say, you know, "I

23 have a warrant," I suppose somebody has to say, "Come

24 in." Is that compelled speech? Does that --

25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, there are --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does that -- does that raise

2 a first-amendment problem?

3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: It does not. And there are

4 many circumstances in which words are used that are

5 incidental to an action. These are not words used that

6 are incidental to the action.

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's happening here is

8 the perspective employers, the recruiters, are

9 proposing a commercial transaction. And it seems to me

10 quite a simple matter for the law schools to have a

11 disclaimer on all of their e-mails and advertisements

12 that say, "The law school does not approve -- and, in

13 fact, disapproves -- of the policies of some of the

14 employers who you will meet."

15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the end of it.

17 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- no matter what the

18 Government does, it cannot convert the career-services

19 enterprise into a value-neutral proposition. For the law

20 school, from its perspective, it's especially value-

21 driven. Yes, the --

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do law schools have an

23 interest in the Constitution that other people don't?

24 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I'm not claiming

25 any exceptionalism for the law schools. The AAUP brief

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 does --

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Well, I --

3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- a brilliant job --

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I suppose, under your

5 view, law schools really shouldn't permit firms -- law

6 firms on campus if those firms, say, oppose -- take

7 litigation positions opposing gay marriage.

8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, as Dale points

9 out, it's up to the private institution to decide what

10 its metrics --

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's --

12 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- are going to be.

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's your position. Your

14 position is, the schools could, and probably should, do

15 that to make their message known.

16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: My position, Your Honor, is

17 that the schools are entitled to make their own

18 judgments about what messages they will disseminate.

19 And even --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Dale is -- Dale --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even with reference to

22 commercial -- proposed commercial transactions?

23 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. But, I

24 would hasten to add, that is not what recruiters are

25 doing. It is no more commercial than what United Foods

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 was doing in an -- advertising, saying -- or resisting

2 the message, "Mushrooms are good."

3 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you agree with the

4 Government, that the statute, as fairly interpreted, is

5 violated when a school which uniformly applies to all

6 employers the rule, "You can't come in if you have the

7 discrimination against hiring gay people"?

8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: You agree that it is

10 violated.

11 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. The

12 statute focuses on the manner of providing access; and

13 the manner of providing access is through the career-

14 services --

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you require any

16 accommodation -- I mean, you have said, "It's up to the

17 faculty to choose which causes to assist" -- I think

18 you put it that way, or one of the amici did -- "and

19 which to resist." And you've already told me that this

20 happens to be the law school, could be the whole

21 university. Could the law faculty, or the university,

22 take the position, "We're not going to -- we don't like

23 your message, and we are not going to let you have any

24 of our facilities. We're not going give you the room

25 on the main campus. Just a total bar"?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, we're certainly

2 not advancing that position here. The Solomon

3 Amendment requires no such thing. The Solomon

4 Amendment does not require that schools give entry to

5 military personnel.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, but a school --

7 MR. ROSENKRANZ: It says you must do it only

8 if the other guy does it.

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- a school, as a matter

10 of its own policy says, "We don't like discrimination,

11 and we're not going to give discriminators access to

12 any of our facilities, period."

13 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, are -- you're

14 asking me what I would be arguing for my clients if

15 they were actually making --

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking --

17 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- taking that position?

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you, Is there any

19 obligation, since you've said there is a compelling

20 State interest -- compelling Government interest in

21 recruiting, is there some obligation to accommodate, or

22 could the faculty just say, "We choose the causes that

23 we assist and the ones we resist"?

24 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And that is as to entry to

25 campus, Your Honor? You're --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

2 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- asking if -- we are not

3 pressing this point to the Court. If the Court is

4 asking what my opinion would be if I --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking --

6 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- were a judge --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- is the -- if it

8 logically follows, from your position, about "choosing

9 the causes we resist and the ones that we assist."

10 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, if I were

11 advancing that argument, it would be, this is a

12 viewpoint-discriminatory statute which is subject to

13 strict scrutiny. The Government is advancing a single

14 message, and, even when the first-amendment rights that

15 are at stake are minimal under this Court's opinion in

16 R.A.V., strict scrutiny would apply. The Government

17 has never come forward which a shred of evidence that

18 it actually needs to be on campus, as opposed to

19 directly off campus, or as opposed to publishing

20 notices in student publications, or advertizing. But -

21 -

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: When you --

23 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- we are not advancing --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- were talking about --

25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- that argument.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- the government's

2 message, the message is, "Join the Army." Is that

3 right?

4 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. The

5 message is, "Join the Army." What the schools hear is

6 --

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: And that's a viewpoint-

8 discriminatory message.

9 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, I'm sorry. The

10 viewpoint discrimination, Your Honor, is in the

11 congressional statute that says, "We will force you to

12 host a single speaker with a single message," just as

13 in Pacific Gas --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: The single message is,

15 "Join the Army."

16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I'm sorry, Justice Stevens,

17 I didn't --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: The single message is,

19 "Join the Army."

20 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The single message is, "Join

21 the Army," that is correct. And the Government is

22 promoting only that one message. But this --

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: I thought your argument was,

24 the single message is, "Join the Army, but not if

25 you're gay."

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

54
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor --

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: And --

3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- that is --

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- which leads me to the

5 question, in response to your answer to Justice

6 Ginsburg a moment ago, in your view is the compelling

7 interest on the part of the Government recruitment or

8 the refusal to accept gays?

9 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The compelling interest on

10 the Government's side is the recruitment interest.

11 We're not arguing that the Government has a compelling

12 interest in excluding anyone. That's precisely why --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but, are you --

14 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- the law --

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- are you saying that the

16 Government -- that the only compelling-interest

17 argument that the Government can raise here is the

18 discriminatory argument? Since nobody denies that, if

19 the Government were recruiting without the

20 discrimination, that there would -- there would --

21 there would be no problem with it. Everyone would

22 agree with -- that that was a compelling --

23 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well --

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- interest. But, I thought

25 your argument on compelling interest was that the only

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

55
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 compelling interest that the Government can assert is

2 the discriminatory interest.

3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, what I'm

4 saying is, if the Government wants to assert a need, it

5 has to identify the need. It has to say, "We need more

6 than contact information. We need more than a room --

7 entry to campus -- a room on campus, a posting on a

8 bulletin board. We need everything."

9 The story of the Solomon Amendment, Your

10 Honor, is the story of private institutions trying

11 desperately to accommodate the Government's need, even

12 in light of their own moral scruples.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the speech is on their

14 side. The Government just says, "Let our recruiters

15 in." So, why isn't it sort of like, "Pay the property

16 tax"? "I don't want to. I hate the government."

17 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: -- "I'm withholding the

19 money because I want to express my message."

20 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The speech is on both sides,

21 because the schools are being forced to host the

22 Government's message. The --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: The message is, "Join the

24 Army." The --

25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The message --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

56
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- message of the property

2 tax is, "Pay the -- pay for the" --

3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The message --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: -- "Government's expenses."

5 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The message that the schools

6 are hearing is, "Join the Army, but not if you're gay."

7 And the schools have been trying desperately to

8 accommodate the Government, up until the point where

9 Congress says, "We don't actually want any of those

10 things. We want them only if you supply them to

11 someone else. We want them only if you have viewpoint-

12 based reason that you don't want to give it to us."

13 There's some reason in the law school's conscience, or

14 the academic institution's conscience, that it wants to

15 treat this category of employers differently from any

16 other. Congress's --

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you -- and you're

18 perfectly free to do that if you don't take the money.

19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, Congress, here,

20 is imposing a sanction, which this Court has treated as

21 exactly the same as a penalty. When --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose that a law-school

23 faculty could decide that it does not favor a

24 particular war, and use that as the basis for excluding

25 recruiters, "By allowing this recruiter to come on

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

57
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 campus, you are making me speak, in effect, to our

2 students, saying, 'Join the Army and fight the war that

3 we're now engaged in.'"

4 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, again, we're

5 not --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: "And I don't want to do

7 that." Now --

8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: We are not talking about --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- what would be the

10 difference?

11 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- coming on campus. We are

12 talking about affirmative assistance to the highest

13 degree --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, okay --

15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- in disseminating the --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- fine. I'm saying the

17 same thing.

18 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The answer is yes, Your --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: But I'm saying --

20 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- Honor.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you would say that the

22 same situation would apply if the university faculty

23 does not favor the particular war that the United

24 States is --

25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

2 therefore, obstructs the effort to raise --

3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- an army --

5 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- it's very --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- by not allowing them to

7 come on campus.

8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: It is very important to

9 distinguish obstruction from refusal to subsidize,

10 which, at the Government's instance, this Court has

11 been doing for 30 years, both --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's obstruction when you

13 refuse to give them what you give what you give

14 everybody else.

15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: It is refusal to treat them

16 the same as everyone else, because they are not the

17 same as everyone else in the law schools' estimation.

18 And the Government --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- fighting a war.

20 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, the Government has to

21 identify precisely what its need is, why it needs Yale

22 college personnel rather than Yale -- excuse me -- why

23 it needs Yale law-school personnel rather than Yale

24 college personnel --

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you --

1 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- to make the appointments.

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question, with that

3 very point in mind? Does it necessarily follow, if

4 there are occasional applications of this statute that

5 might be invalid, that the whole Solomon Amendment

6 needs to be struck down?

7 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the -- this is

8 not about application of the statute in one

9 circumstance. The whole statute has to be struck down,

10 because the Government is demanding absolute parity and

11 there's no way for this Court to rewrite the statute.

12 We don't know whether Congress would go back and go to

13 the entry requirement, just bear entry, to entry-plus,

14 or to a parity requirement, which is -- which it has

15 now shifted to. So, there is simply no way to know

16 exactly how Congress would rewrite the statute. But

17 this is, at its heart, an as-applied challenge. It's

18 about law schools with nondiscrimination policies.

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you --

20 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you --

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- Counsel.

22 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- Your Honors.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General Clement, you

24 have 4 minutes remaining.

25 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

60
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

2 GENERAL CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief

3 Justice. I'd like to make just a few points in

4 rebuttal.

5 First of all, in starting with the compelled-

6 speech problem, there are only two kinds of speech that

7 are at issue here. First, there is the compelled

8 speech of the military recruiters. And no one thinks

9 that that speech is being misattributed to the schools.

10 Even in the secondary-school context, in Mergens, this

11 Court understood that secondary students could

12 distinguish between the school's message and that of

13 school groups.

14 Now, the second piece of speech that's at

15 issue is that of the university, when they incidentally

16 send an e-mail around telling the students where the

17 military recruiters are going to be on a certain day.

18 And certainly in the context of recruiting, that kind

19 of incidental speech does not implicate any compelled-

20 speech doctrine. In the Title VII context, for

21 example, if an employer says that there's a job

22 opening, and says that to a white applicant, it has to

23 say the same thing to an African-American applicant.

24 Nobody would think that that other -- saying that to

25 the African-American applicant, which is, of course,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

61
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 compelled speech by Title VII, violates the

2 Constitution.

3 I would also say, just as the last point on

4 compelled speech, that it's something of a stranger in

5 a strange land in the context of this case, since we

6 are talking about a funding condition, not a

7 compulsion.

8 Second, let me move to the argument that the

9 Respondents have about trying to distinguish this case

10 from Justice Stevens' World War II hypothetical. And,

11 as I understand it, it boils down to the argument that

12 the way that the legislature was reacting here to this

13 problem and observing what it observed on campus

14 somehow implicates different constitutional issues,

15 different first-amendment issues. And I think the

16 O'Brien case stands as an obstacle to that argument.

17 In that case, if you look at it, the argument was

18 exactly the same. There already was a prohibition that

19 required you to have your draft card with you.

20 Congress then passed a second statute that prohibited

21 burning your draft card.

22 Now, what did the Representatives say about

23 that? Well, Representative Bray, of Indiana, said that

24 this was an effort to get at "communist stooges and

25 beatniks." Now, this Court did not strike the statute

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

62
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 down on that basis. It looked at the text of the

2 statute and upheld the statute as a reasonable statute.

3 Let me also, then, move to what you could

4 call the "Bob Jones problem." And I think you have to

5 have be cautious about interpreting this statute in

6 applying a rule and having it come back in the context

7 of other statutes that even the law schools like, like

8 Title VI and Title IX. I don't think it's enough to

9 simply say that race is going to be different. For one

10 thing, Federal statutes also prohibit, as a condition

11 on funding, universitywide discrimination on the basis

12 of disability and on the basis of age. Now, those

13 aren't things that trigger heightened scrutiny, and I

14 think one has to be worried about converting this rule

15 in this case to something that's going to threaten

16 those statutes.

17 This Court, in Hishon, for example, made the

18 point that all discrimination can be recharacterized as

19 somebody simply saying -- exercising their

20 associational rights, "I don't want to associate with

21 you, because you're female," in Hishon. You have to be

22 leery of that kind of recharacterization.

23 The last point I would make is that there's

24 simply no limit on Respondent's argument in this case.

25 I don't think their matter of conscious limitation is

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

63
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 going to be enforceable by the courts. And, beyond

2 that, I think, even in this case, there is more at

3 issue here than just the military's policy on

4 homosexuals. If you look at the original statement of

5 the American Association of Law Schools -- which is in

6 the joint appendix at 246 and 249 -- they were

7 concerned, first and foremost, about the military's

8 policies on homosexuals, but also about the

9 discrimination in sex, on what kind of combat roles

10 that women could have, what they call career-advancing

11 positions. So, even if Congress changed "don't ask,

12 don't tell" tomorrow, the -- presumably, the law

13 schools would still be here protesting the military's

14 position on gender, or perhaps the war in Iraq, or

15 perhaps the war in Afghanistan.

16 And the last point in showing there is no

17 limits on their position is, as Justice Kennedy pointed

18 out, any conduct can be imbued with communicative force

19 just by saying, "We're opposed to this, and, therefore,

20 we're going to engage in this conduct." That's simply

21 not enough to generate a significant first-amendment

22 interest.

23 Thank you.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.

25 The case is submitted.
