2 (10:03 a.m.)

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

4 first today in Whitman versus Department of Transportation.

5 Ms. Karlan.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8 MS. KARLAN: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,

9 and may it please the Court:

10 The Government now concedes that the Ninth

11 Circuit erred in holding that the negotiated grievance

12 procedure of the Civil Service Reform Act strips

13 Federal courts of their jurisdiction to hear

14 constitutional claims by Federal employees.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: We're not bound by that

16 concession. If that's a jurisdictional question,

17 doesn't matter whether the Government conceded it or

18 not, does it?

19 MS. KARLAN: No. That's correct, but the

20 Government correctly conceded perhaps I should have

21 said.

22 So I think that the --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different question.

24 MS. KARLAN: Yes. So the question before the

25 Court is not whether, I think, Mr. Whitman can receive

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 constitutional judicial review, but rather, where and

2 how he is supposed to do so.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I still think it's whether

4 because I don't agree with the Government. Can I do

5 that?

6 MS. KARLAN: Of course, you can.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: So that is the question. I

8 mean, the question is open whether there --

9 MS. KARLAN: Yes. I -- I think, obviously,

10 the Court has an obligation to satisfy itself of the

11 jurisdiction. But I'll point out then that you would

12 have had that obligation as well in NTEU against Von

13 Raab in which this Court addressed precisely the same

14 kind of case, litigated in precisely the same posture.

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was it raised? Was that

16 objection, the jurisdictional question, raised in the

17 briefs and --

18 MS. KARLAN: It was raised in the district

19 court and the Government chose not to raise it in the

20 court of appeals or here. But, of course, you have, as

21 Justice Scalia said, an independent obligation to

22 satisfy yourself of your subject matter jurisdiction.

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: But our cases say that where

24 we don't speak to a jurisdictional question, it is not

25 regarded as having been decided.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. KARLAN: No. I'm not saying that you

2 decided it in NTEU against Von Raab, Justice Scalia.

3 I'm just saying that given that you were apparently

4 satisfied with the theory, you should be satisfied here

5 too as well.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even -- even if you assume

7 that Von Raab decided it, you have a quite different

8 situation here. The issue isn't whether there will be

9 any judicial review. The issue is whether there will

10 be judicial review for the minor grievances, even if

11 they happen to involve a constitutional issue, that are

12 -- that are not -- for which judicial review was not

13 provided. Any major employee action -- judicial

14 review, as I understand it, is available, and it is

15 only relatively insignificant actions for which

16 judicial review is not available. Isn't that right?

17 MS. KARLAN: No. With all respect, Justice

18 Scalia, I think that's incorrect.

19 The Civil Service Reform Act provides for

20 judicial review of personnel actions, and if you go

21 back to the opinion for the Court that you wrote in

22 Fausto, you'll see that you repeatedly referred to them

23 as personnel actions there.

24 Now, a warrantless search of a Government

25 employee, as this Court's opinion in Bush against Lucas

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 says at note 28, is not a personnel action, and

2 therefore, there is no way of obtaining review of it

3 through the Civil Service Reform Act. But it is not in

4 any sense here a minor violation of Mr. Whitman's

5 rights.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: He could have refused -- he

7 could have refused the search, in which case if there

8 was any significant personnel action taken against him

9 for refusing it, he would have had judicial review of

10 whether the search was constitutional or not.

11 MS. KARLAN: Yes, Justice Scalia, but he

12 would have to bet the ranch to do it. And I think --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's often the case where

14 -- where, in -- in order to challenge a governmental

15 action, you -- you have to be willing to -- to go to

16 court by resisting it.

17 MS. KARLAN: Justice Scalia, I think that's

18 incorrect when it comes to Government agency actions of

19 this kind. That's what the Abbott Laboratories case

20 that we cite in our brief makes quite clear.

21 And I think last week, just last week, this

22 Court understood precisely that problem in talking

23 about the doctor who faces the abortion statute in

24 Ayotte. And several members of the Court pointed out

25 that to risk your license there or to risk, in this

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 case, a job that our client has held for 20 years in

2 order to challenge whether his Fourth Amendment rights

3 are violated is not normally how judicial review should

4 be accomplished.

5 And so the question here really is how

6 judicial review should be accomplished, and we've

7 maintained all along that the way judicial review

8 should be accomplished here is the way that it's

9 accomplished in all sorts of cases, by bringing an

10 action in the Federal district court seeking injunctive

11 relief.

12 Now, what the Government --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though if -- if

14 -- do you concede that if he had, for example, refused

15 the testing and been fired and it was a major personnel

16 action, he would have to go through the statutory

17 procedures before bringing that -- the constitutional

18 claim on review of those administrative procedures?

19 MS. KARLAN: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't it seem

21 odd -- and this is sort of the logic of -- in Fausto

22 and some of the other cases -- that when you have a

23 major action, you have to exhaust before you can go

24 into court, but if you have something that doesn't

25 qualify as a major adverse action, you get to go to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 court right away?

2 MS. KARLAN: I can see why that might seem at

3 first a little strange to you, Your Honor. But the

4 point of the CSRA is to deal not with major versus

5 minor actions. It's true that minor actions you get

6 administrative review and not judicial review, but

7 that's about personnel actions. Mr. Whitman is not

8 challenging a personnel action here. He's challenging

9 a warrantless search. The warrantless search was the

10 non-random, arbitrary urinalysis and breathalyzer to

11 which he was subjected.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that search was a

13 consequence of his employment. It -- this wasn't a

14 search of a -- of a citizen who had no connection with

15 the Government. It was a search that he was required

16 to submit to as an employee. So to -- to describe it

17 as unrelated to employee action seems to me

18 unrealistic. The only reason he submitted to it was

19 that if he didn't, he would have -- he would have been

20 subject to an employee action.

21 MS. KARLAN: No, Justice Scalia. He was

22 required, as a condition of his employment, to submit

23 to constitutional drug testing. And his allegation in

24 this case is that this drug test was unconstitutional

25 and --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think it becomes

2 unconstitutional when -- when you have one more test?

3 What did it become unconstitutional? The first test

4 was not unconstitutional.

5 MS. KARLAN: No, Your Honor. It became

6 unconstitutional when it became clear that at the

7 Anchorage air traffic control facility, they were not

8 complying with the requirements both of --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: How many tests did he have?

10 MS. KARLAN: Well, he alleges in his

11 complaint that he was subjected to 13 tests, and then

12 when he complained --

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Over what period of time?

14 MS. KARLAN: Over a period of time of

15 approximately 5 years in which other employees were

16 subjected to no more than one or two.

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: So it's maybe three --

18 three a year? Is that what it was?

19 MS. KARLAN: Yes, but he was picked --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: And that's

21 unconstitutional?

22 MS. KARLAN: No, Justice Stevens. His

23 allegation is he was picked seven times in a row for

24 random drug testing.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, somebody will be if

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it's random. If you have thousands of people, somebody

2 will be if it is random. If there were nobody who was

3 picked seven times, that would show it wasn't random.

4 So, you know --

5 MS. KARLAN: Right, and --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: -- whether he has a good

7 constitutional claim here I guess is rather doubtful --

8 MS. KARLAN: Well, he may well not. He may

9 well lose on his constitutional claim, Justice Breyer,

10 and that's not the issue before this Court. The

11 question is whether a district judge should decide,

12 should listen to the facts and decide whether this was

13 random or not.

14 I tried once to calculate what are the

15 chances of --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: What are they? How many

17 people are there? How many people are tested if you

18 try to calculate it? How many --

19 MS. KARLAN: I -- I tried to do it and I

20 couldn't do it.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: -- in the Federal

22 Government?

23 MS. KARLAN: Well, it wouldn't --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: All you do is you get a bell

25 curve and you ask the Library of Congress and they'll

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 do it --

2 MS. KARLAN: Well, right, but it would be --

3 I -- I know. You know, I -- it -- my calculator

4 doesn't go that high.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: No. It's -- it's not hard

6 to do.

7 MS. KARLAN: But it's high.

8 JUSTICE BREYER: But it's not hard to do.

9 You just ask someone at Stanford. They'll do it for

10 you.

11 (Laughter.)

12 JUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the --

13 MS. KARLAN: It's the undergraduates that

14 know how to do that.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Regardless, this

16 is beside the point.

17 I -- all right. Can I -- I just want you at

18 some point to get to not just the constitutional

19 question. Maybe he can go in and raise his claim. I

20 don't know if he should have exhausted or not, et

21 cetera.

22 MS. KARLAN: Right.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: But I find it hard, in

24 reading this, to believe the following. Like any other

25 worker, I mean, normally you have a collective

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 bargaining agreement, and the union takes up your minor

2 thing. And here, what you're saying is although if

3 it's a major thing, like a personnel action, there's a

4 special thing where you get in -- you know, you -- you

5 get into court way down the road. It's very

6 complicated. This individual, even though he

7 classifies it as a grievance where the union is

8 supposed to take it up and the union tells him we're

9 not going to take it up, we don't believe in your

10 claim, that then he can run in to a Federal judge.

11 Now, that -- that I find surprising, and I'd like you

12 to explain how in your theory that works.

13 MS. KARLAN: Yes, Justice Breyer. The

14 problem with assuming that a union will take a claim

15 like this to arbitration is the following. Unions

16 generally do not take individual employee grievances to

17 arbitration, especially if you look at this collective

18 bargaining agreement, which requires the union to pay

19 the costs if they lose.

20 Now, on a claim like this, for the very

21 reason that you suggested earlier, it may be difficult

22 to figure out what the facts are.

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your position,

24 Ms. Karlan, was that he doesn't even have to ask the

25 union. Justice Breyer is presenting a scenario where

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 he asks the union and the union says we've got better

2 things to do with our money.

3 MS. KARLAN: That's right.

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I think your position

5 is he doesn't have to ask at all. He can go directly

6 into Federal court under 1331.

7 MS. KARLAN: That's correct. Just as, for

8 example, the employees did in the NFFE against

9 Weinberger case on which you sat in the court of

10 appeals where the Government again there tried to argue

11 there was no subject matter jurisdiction, and the court

12 really gave that argument the back of its hand because

13 traditionally the way that someone who wants to allege,

14 someone who is an employee or not who wants to allege,

15 that there -- that he's seeking injunctive relief for a

16 constitutional violation, goes to the Federal district

17 courts under 28 U.S.C. 1331, not to a negotiated

18 grievance procedure that was not intended and cannot

19 operate in the way that the Government seems to hope --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why -- why can't he?

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not? Because my --

22 when I first looked at this, I thought, well, this is

23 the kind of thing that should have been -- should have

24 been resolved at the grievance level, it shouldn't have

25 even have to get to arbitration if he's right. He

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 wants a survey to see if he's being picked on. If he

2 is, there would be redress. So it seemed like this was

3 the kind of complaint that was best handled in that

4 kind of procedure.

5 MS. KARLAN: Well, I have two somewhat

6 different answers to your question, Justice Ginsburg.

7 One, which I'll turn to in a moment, is about the

8 specifics of this case, but I want to give the more

9 general one first. And that is, that the negotiated

10 grievance procedures that unions set up are for the

11 benefit of employees who believe that that is the best

12 way of seeking to resolve their complaints, and most

13 complaints, quite honestly, will be done that way.

14 Most people are not going to go into Federal court,

15 especially not if all they can seek is injunctive

16 relief and they have to pay a filing fee and it's going

17 to take a long time to go there.

18 Now, Mr. Whitman had two problems that made

19 it unlikely he was going to go through the grievance

20 process here. The first of these problems is that the

21 grievance process, as it sets -- as it's set out in the

22 joint appendix, the two stages of which he has control

23 -- and I can return in a moment to what happens after

24 that. But the two stages at which he has control are

25 to talk to his supervisor and to talk to the facility

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 manager.

2 When it comes to drug testing of the kind to

3 which Mr. Whitman was subjected here, his supervisor

4 does not have authority over that. It's done from

5 outside the facility. So talking to his supervisor

6 will not get him anywhere.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but that simply means

8 that the grievance procedure is more valuable in this

9 case than merely talking to his supervisor. And -- and

10 the -- the issue -- maybe -- maybe we're missing it,

11 but the issue is why isn't there a very good reason to

12 require him to go through the grievance procedure,

13 number one, to -- to cut down on needless Federal court

14 actions and, number two, under the -- sort of the

15 general policy of favoring what collective bargaining

16 agreements negotiate.

17 MS. KARLAN: Well, if his union had

18 negotiated a collective bargaining agreement that

19 required exhaustion, then it would be appropriate to

20 make him go through it, but they didn't do that.

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but -- no -- no

22 question. That would be an easier case. But why

23 shouldn't we require an exhaustion for those two

24 reasons and maybe others?

25 MS. KARLAN: Well, if I could go through the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 grievance process, I think you'll see why this

2 grievance process cannot be turned into an exhaustion

3 process without this Court, in words that Justice

4 Ginsburg used last week, inserting a lot of carets into

5 the statute.

6 That is, there are two stages of this

7 grievance process over which Mr. Whitman has control.

8 He can go to his -- his supervisor in an informal

9 conversation. There will be no factfinding. There is

10 no right to call witnesses. There is no right to

11 present evidence.

12 If he doesn't like that -- and he has only 15

13 days to do it -- he can then appeal to the -- to the

14 supervisor of the facility. Again, he has no right to

15 present evidence. He has no right to any kind of

16 factfinding. He has no right to a reasoned decision.

17 Those are the --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: He may not have any right to

19 it, but in fact, he may get some relief.

20 MS. KARLAN: Well --

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: The union may say, okay,

22 we're going to take this one up.

23 MS. KARLAN: They may and I'll turn to that

24 in just a moment, but let me add one more thing to the

25 answer I was giving a moment ago to Justice Ginsburg,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 which is one of the problems here is that our client

2 alleges in his supplemental complaint that when he

3 first complained about this, he was singled out yet

4 again for retaliatory testing. And so this is

5 precisely the kind of case in which someone who is

6 being subjected repeatedly to retaliatory tests would

7 be worried.

8 Now let me turn to the question of --

9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Ms. Karlan, let me

10 put one other element in here. Was -- was your client

11 specifically told by the FLRA to bring a grievance

12 under the collective bargaining agreement?

13 MS. KARLAN: He was -- he wasn't told. He

14 was advised by someone who said the FLRA has no

15 jurisdiction here because this isn't an unfair labor

16 practice. Now, of course, what the Government wants

17 him to do is to exhaust by going back to the FLRA which

18 has already told him that it has no expertise on this

19 matter.

20 So let me turn to that third stage of the

21 grievance process now, which is now he invokes

22 arbitration, or at least he asks his union to because

23 under section 7121(b)(1)(C)(iii) of the statute, only

24 the union can invoke arbitration. Now, this Court

25 noted, as long ago as Vaca against Sipes, that unions

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 invoke arbitration in only a minuscule handful of

2 cases, so that in Vaca against Sipes, it was 1 out of

3 900.

4 There was a recent study, the most recent

5 study I could find that was published, about Federal

6 Government employees, dealt with civilian employees of

7 the Army, and it looked at how often did the 31

8 different unions that represent civilian employees of

9 the Army actually invoke arbitration vis-a-vis the

10 number of grievances that were filed. And it found

11 that in the years it looked at, no more than 6 percent

12 got arbitration.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why isn't the thing to

14 do here -- I -- I see that you are raising a

15 significant question in respect to -- at least in my

16 view, in respect to the -- an action that violates a

17 regulation that violates a statute. Leave the

18 Constitution aside, but it might violate a number of

19 practices, good practices, et cetera. But why isn't

20 focusing on that the thing for the plaintiff here to do

21 is he goes to the union -- I'm just reading from page 6

22 and 7 of your brief -- and he says, I would like you to

23 invoke arbitration? And they might do it. Now, if

24 they do it and it comes out a way they don't like,

25 he then -- they might file exceptions and they might

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 win.

2 But what you're worried about is if they

3 don't win or if they don't do it, they can go to court

4 only if it involved an unfair labor practice or a major

5 adverse personnel action. That's what's worrying you,

6 I take it.

7 MS. KARLAN: Yes, Your Honor.

8 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why isn't it, at that

9 stage if he doesn't get into court, you then say that

10 that isn't true? They should be able to come to court

11 in other instances as well, making the same kinds of

12 arguments that you're making now.

13 MS. KARLAN: Well, there are two reasons for

14 that I think.

15 One is he suffers an irreparable bet-the-farm

16 injury every time he's searched unconstitutionally.

17 The second is that the statute simply doesn't

18 say that. I can understand -- honestly, I can -- why

19 this Court is in favor of exhaustion requirements. And

20 if the statute contained one, it would be eminently

21 sensible for you to apply it.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: You -- you -- I -- I believe

23 that there are millions of instances, perhaps. Now,

24 I'm -- when I think something like this, I'm quite

25 often wrong. But I thought that the reason that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 exhaustion is required is not always because statutes

2 require it. It's partly because of the word final in

3 the APA, which applies here as well, and it's also

4 because of the common law of administrative law that

5 requires people to exhaust their remedies.

6 MS. KARLAN: Absolutely, and I think if you

7 used this Court's opinion in Madigan against McCarthy

8 as your template for thinking about whether to impose

9 an exhaustion requirement here, because I think, quite

10 frankly, that's what you would be doing -- you would be

11 imposing one that doesn't exist now.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but the -- the --

13 MS. KARLAN: The Court --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the whole right to -- to

15 go into court with a constitutional claim is absent

16 from the statute. And -- and so we may as well get

17 hung for a sheep as a lamb. If -- if we're going to

18 recognize the one, I don't see that we're going too

19 much further in -- in saying it's got to be conditional

20 on the other.

21 MS. KARLAN: I -- I don't think so, Justice

22 Souter, because I think this Court has traditionally

23 allowed individuals who are bringing constitutional

24 claims for injunctive relief to seek that relief.

25 Nothing in the CSRA changed that, and if I can explain

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1 why for just a moment, I think it'll be helpful.

2 If you look at this Court's opinion in Fausto

3 or you look at this Court's opinion in Bush against

4 Lucas or the opinion in Karahalios, which I think are

5 the three leading cases from this Court construing the

6 Civil Service Reform Act in -- in this kind of fashion,

7 you'll notice that they repeatedly refer to those

8 acts as being comprehensive with regard to personnel

9 actions.

10 Personnel actions is not a casual phrase. It

11 is a defined term in the CSRA. It's defined in section

12 2302(a), which is -- was discussed in the Government's

13 brief at page 5, note 5. And you will notice there, if

14 you read it, that they do include -- indeed, Congress

15 in 1994 amended the statute to add to the list of

16 personnel actions orders for psychiatric testing.

17 There was nothing here that turns a drug test into a

18 personnel action.

19 Now, the CSRA is absolutely comprehensive in

20 its field, but its field is personnel actions. And

21 this case is not a personnel action.

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the grievance procedure

23 covers it, and you took pains to point out to us that

24 when you go to the grievance procedure, you're not

25 necessarily entitled to findings and -- and written

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 conclusions, et cetera. But there's a reason for that.

2 The reason for that is that these things can be very,

3 very minor. So now you're saying that just because of

4 -- the grievance procedure doesn't entitle you

5 necessarily to findings, et cetera, that you can go

6 into court. But the only reason you don't get those

7 findings is because we know, going in, that they're so

8 minor. So now the most minor things go to court. That

9 seems very anomalous.

10 MS. KARLAN: Justice Kennedy, all sorts of

11 personnel actions might be minor and they might be the

12 kind of thing that the CSRA wants to have decided

13 administratively only or through exhaustion. This is a

14 Fourth Amendment violation. It is not minor. As this

15 Court held in Von Raab, the only thing that makes this

16 kind of test constitutional --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: I have to interrupt you.

18 What is the Fourth Amendment violation?

19 MS. KARLAN: The Fourth Amendment violation

20 here is this Court said that warrantless, suspicionless

21 drug testing of Federal employees is acceptable only if

22 it has safeguards that ensure that there is no

23 discretion exercised in the field and that it's truly

24 random.

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: As I understand, the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 allegations are that there was random procedure in

2 effect, and he thinks maybe he's been tested more

3 frequently than some other people. That's all.

4 MS. KARLAN: No, Your Honor. He alleges that

5 they are not, in fact, following the random procedures,

6 that instead, when it's more convenient for them to

7 test him -- and I can understand why they want to test

8 him. Every time they test him he passes the test. So

9 why not ask Mr. Whitman who is a compliant, sober

10 employee, if you need another person to just round out

11 the numbers to --

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but as I understand

13 it, the -- the system as a whole is not challenged as

14 violating the Fourth Amendment.

15 MS. KARLAN: No. The operation of the

16 system, as it applies to Mr. Whitman in Anchorage.

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: By having him take more

18 tests than would be produced by a purely random

19 selection.

20 MS. KARLAN: That's correct. And then by

21 retaliating --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Have we ever said that's a

23 Fourth Amendment violation?

24 MS. KARLAN: Of course it is, because you

25 can't conduct a random --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: If the computer

2 malfunctions, that's a Fourth Amendment violation?

3 MS. KARLAN: No. And if the Government --

4 the Government in its answer in the district court does

5 not say there was a computer malfunction. They say we

6 don't really even keep records back as long as he --

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the relief that he

8 requested was to do a little more testing to see

9 whether he was being tested more than the average

10 person, as I understand it.

11 MS. KARLAN: Well -- well, yes. Of course,

12 he was proceeding pro se in the district court.

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which is not -- did not

14 seem to me to be alleging a violation of the Fourth

15 Amendment.

16 MS. KARLAN: No. He -- he did. He said it

17 is not random, and then in his supplemental complaint,

18 he alleged that he was retaliated against for

19 complaining the first time around and was selected out

20 when he wasn't on the list to be tested yet again.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. -- Ms. Karlan, if this

22 is indeed serious, are you sure that it's not a

23 personnel action?

24 MS. KARLAN: Yes.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is a residual category

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in the definition of personnel action which says, any

2 other significant change in duties, responsibilities,

3 or working conditions. That's the residual category.

4 But one of the specifically named categories,

5 before you get to that, is a decision to order

6 psychiatric testing. Now, if that kind of a decision

7 could be a personnel action, why couldn't a decision to

8 conduct -- to conduct a drug test be considered a

9 personnel action?

10 MS. KARLAN: Well, two answers to that. One

11 is the fact that Congress -- in 1978 they first gave

12 the entire list of personnel actions. In 1994, they

13 amended that list to add psychiatric testing. This is

14 after the Government has already been engaged in urine

15 testing of Federal employees. If they wanted to say

16 drug testing, they would have said it. And for you to

17 add that is really --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not adding it. There's

19 a residual category at the end: or any other

20 significant change in duties, responsibilities, or

21 working conditions. I consider this -- you consider it

22 a significant change in working conditions.

23 MS. KARLAN: With all respect --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: And he thought he didn't

25 have to undergo drug testing, and what do you know?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 He's being picked on for drug testing all the time.

2 MS. KARLAN: Well, with all respect, Your

3 Honor, I think you would have to overrule the Fort

4 Stewart School against FLRA case that the Court decided

5 in 1990 to define working conditions to include a drug

6 test because there -- and it's cited at page 28 of the

7 NTEU's brief -- the Court says that the term, working

8 conditions, refers to, quote, circumstances or states

9 of affairs attendant to one's performance of a job.

10 Now, drug testing is not attendant to his

11 performance of his job. It is the condition of his

12 holding the job in some sense that he pass the test.

13 And if he failed that test, he would, indeed, have to

14 go through the CSRA. But because he passed the test,

15 he has no way of getting into court.

16 Now, if I could turn --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why then would a decision to

18 order psychiatric testing qualify? Because it says, or

19 any other. Right?

20 MS. KARLAN: That's --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Significant change in

22 duties, responsibilities, or working conditions. The

23 implication is that a decision to order psychiatric

24 testing is a significant change in duties,

25 responsibilities, or -- or working conditions.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. KARLAN: But if the -- but if Congress,

2 Justice Scalia, had thought that that catchall phrase

3 covered psychiatric tests, it would not have amended

4 the statute in 1994 to add them specifically.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's always good to be safe.

6 MS. KARLAN: Well, yes, and it's good for the

7 FAA to comply with the Constitution. And that's why we

8 think he should be allowed to go to Federal court.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. -- Ms. Karlan,

10 you have a -- a statutory claim that essentially

11 mirrors the constitutional claim. The statute requires

12 the testing to be random and impartial. If we think

13 there's a difference between the constitutional claims

14 and statutory claims with respect to their treatment

15 under the CSRA, how do you handle that? Does he have

16 to exhaust the statutory claim but not the

17 constitutional one?

18 MS. KARLAN: I don't think that there would

19 be a difference with respect to exhaustion on those two

20 claims. The Government simply says he can never get

21 review of the statutory claim. So I don't think anyone

22 here is arguing that there should be a differential

23 treatment with respect to exhaustion. It's with

24 respect to whether you can get into court --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you -- you agree with

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the Government on that, that he can never get review of

2 the statutory claim.

3 MS. KARLAN: Oh, no.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, well.

5 MS. KARLAN: We spend rather a bit of time in

6 our brief explaining --

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, don't -- don't appeal

8 to them on a -- on a point on which you don't agree

9 with them. I mean --

10 MS. KARLAN: What can I -- what can I say?

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I still don't

12 understand how they proceed. Does he have to bring --

13 can he go right into court on the constitutional claim

14 even if the statutory claim has to go through the

15 grievance procedure?

16 MS. KARLAN: The answer to that would be yes.

17 He might end up being precluded, if he lost in Federal

18 court on the constitutional claim, from coming back on

19 the statutory claim.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the identical

21 claims have to proceed under two different routes.

22 MS. KARLAN: No, Your Honor. We don't think

23 there is exhaustion required with respect to either set

24 of claims.

25 If I may, I'll reserve the balance of my

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 time.

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

4 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

5 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

6 MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

7 please the Court:

8 Although Congress has not clearly expressed

9 an intent to foreclose all judicial review of

10 petitioner's constitutional claim, such review should

11 be conducted in a manner that is as consistent as

12 possible with the text and structure of the CSRA.

13 Because petitioner failed to invoke the grievance

14 procedures of the applicable collective bargaining

15 agreement, his suit was properly dismissed.

16 And if I may, just in a -- a moment or two,

17 summarize the Government's position as to the steps

18 that an individual in petitioner's position would have

19 to take in order to obtain judicial review of a

20 constitutional claim like this one.

21 First, the employee must make all reasonable

22 efforts to utilize the available administrative

23 remedies under the CSRA itself, including any

24 applicable collective bargaining agreement. So in this

25 instance, the first two steps of the grievance process,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 talking to the immediate supervisor and then to the

2 facility manager, would have been within petitioner's

3 control. And if those steps had proven unavailing,

4 petitioner should have requested that the union take

5 the case to arbitration, and then, if necessary, to the

6 FLRA.

7 Second, if at the end of the administrative

8 process an avenue of judicial review is available under

9 the CSRA itself, the employee must seek relief pursuant

10 to that provision.

11 And I think petitioner really concedes that

12 point to be true; that is, if petitioner were raising a

13 constitutional challenge to a major adverse action,

14 such as dismissal, petitioner concedes not only that he

15 would have been required to exhaust administrative

16 remedies by -- by appealing to the Merit Systems

17 Protection Board, but petitioner also concedes that we

18 -- he would have had to seek judicial review in the

19 manner specified by the CSRA, that is, by filing a

20 petition for review of the MSPB's decision in the

21 Federal Circuit, rather than proceeding directly to

22 district court.

23 And finally, our position is that if at the

24 conclusion of the administrative process, judicial

25 review is unavailable under the CSRA, the employee may

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 then obtain review of his constitutional challenge

2 alone in district court, pursuant to the Administrative

3 Procedure -- Procedure Act.

4 Now, in some sense, there is an element of

5 untidiness in our position because what we're trying to

6 do is reconcile Congress' intent to adopt --

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, can I just ask

8 one question? Because I didn't quite follow it. I

9 thought you were describing a major personnel action in

10 -- in your description of the administrative review.

11 But if this is a minor or whatever, a lesser review,

12 would there have been an avenue through the

13 administrative agency?

14 MR. STEWART: There would have been, at least

15 for this employee, by virtue of the fact that he was

16 covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Through the collective

18 bargaining --

19 MR. STEWART: Yes.

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: But then supposing the

21 union is unwilling to grieve or take it up or he fails,

22 then what happens?

23 MR. STEWART: If -- if he requests that the

24 union take the grievance to arbitration and then to the

25 FLRA and the union refuses, our position would be that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 he could then file suit in Federal district court under

2 the Administrative Procedure Act on his constitutional

3 challenge alone. That is, we think on the one --

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: And it would be in the

5 district court.

6 MR. STEWART: That would be in the district

7 court --

8 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, that is if -- if the

9 union doesn't agree to arbitration?

10 MR. STEWART: That is if the union does not

11 agree to take the case to arbitration and then to the

12 FLRA. If --

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So your difference --

14 what's separating you and Whitman, it seems, is a

15 question of timing. The action that you're describing

16 that would come at the end, after he's used the

17 administrative process, is the same one that he is

18 seeking to bring at the front end. That is, it's a

19 1331 action --

20 MR. STEWART: I think --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and -- and it's based

22 on the Government's waiver of sovereign immunity for

23 nonmonetary claims.

24 MR. STEWART: It is in part one of timing,

25 but it's not one of timing alone. That is, our

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 position is if Mr. Whitman had been successful in

2 prevailing upon the union to take the case to

3 arbitration and then to the FLRA, the position we've

4 taken in the brief is that judicial review, if the FLRA

5 had rendered an unfavorable decision, would most

6 appropriately be accomplished in the court of appeals

7 pursuant to the CSRA.

8 But our position is if the union is unwilling

9 to take the grievance to the point where the ruling can

10 be reviewed under the provisions of the CSRA itself,

11 that the APA remains available as a fallback.

12 But the -- the fact that it's one of timing

13 doesn't make it an insignificant difference. That is

14 --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stewart, you know, you

16 have here a statute in which Congress, with malice

17 aforethought, very clearly provides for judicial review

18 of any major personnel actions and does not provide for

19 judicial review of what it had regarded as

20 insignificant personnel actions. I can understand the

21 position, although I don't agree with it, that the

22 constitutional provision which says Congress can -- can

23 make exceptions to the jurisdiction of the Federal

24 courts should not be interpreted to exclude significant

25 constitutional claims. But when Congress has gone to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the trouble of providing for judicial review of any

2 claims that are significant and just saying any other

3 insignificant action, even though a constitutional

4 violation is alleged in connection with it, if in fact

5 it does not harm you that much, we're not going to

6 allow judicial review, what is -- what is wrong with

7 that? It seems to me that's what Congress has said and

8 -- and you're creating a scheme that simply contradicts

9 what Congress plainly said.

10 MR. STEWART: I mean, first, certainly if

11 Congress had said with absolute clarity that district

12 court review of claims like this is precluded, we would

13 defend the statute as constitutional.

14 Second, I agree with you that the fairest

15 reading, the most likely interpretation of Congress'

16 intent is that claims of this nature -- that is,

17 complaints about aspects of the employment relationship

18 that don't rise to the level of personnel actions. The

19 fairest reading of Congress' intent is that such suits

20 would be precluded.

21 However, this Court in a number of prior

22 decisions has required something more than that before

23 inferring that Congress has barred all judicial review

24 of a colorable constitutional claim.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did any of them involve a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 situation in which Congress took the pain to separate

2 significant actions from insignificant actions?

3 MR. STEWART: I mean, in some sense the CSRA

4 --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, some of them involve

6 deportation and, you know, major -- major actions.

7 This is a case where Congress has -- has carefully

8 tried to say these are major actions for which you

9 should be able to get into the courts. And these other

10 things -- you -- you have these administrative

11 remedies, but that's the end of it.

12 MR. STEWART: But I -- I think the flip side

13 of it is that some of those cases involved statutes

14 that appeared on their face to function as express

15 preclusions of judicial review. Here, we don't have

16 that. Here, the argument as to why Administrative

17 Procedure Act review is precluded is not based on the

18 text of any CSRA provision standing alone. It's based

19 --

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm -- I'm not sure

21 what the congressional intent would be to bifurcate the

22 constitutional and the statutory claims, especially if

23 they're the same thing.

24 MR. STEWART: I don't know that there was

25 necessarily an intent to bifurcate, but I think we had

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the same --

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's what -- that's

3 what you're asking us to say.

4 MR. STEWART: I think the Court had the same

5 situation in Webster v. Doe. That is, in Webster v.

6 Doe, the Court concluded that given the limits on

7 review of the CIA director's employment decisions and

8 given the great sensitivity of hiring and firing

9 matters within that agency, the Court concluded that

10 there was simply no law to apply in review of the --

11 the claimant's complaint under the Administrative

12 Procedure Act. Nevertheless, the Court concluded that

13 judicial review of the constitutional challenge

14 remained available.

15 And the idea was not so much that Congress

16 itself had manifested an intent to differentiate

17 between the two types of claims. It was that Congress

18 had treated the two types of claims the same but that

19 the type of evidence that will suffice to eliminate

20 judicial review of a non-constitutional claim is --

21 it's less demanding than the type that the Court would

22 require before eliminating judicial review of a

23 constitutional claim.

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if -- if -- under --

25 under your explanation of how the system works, you go

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to district court with a constitutional claim. He's --

2 he -- the district court doesn't have to reach the

3 statutory claim first?

4 MR. STEWART: No. The statutory claim

5 wouldn't be before the district court. Again, if -- if

6 the --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's what I mean.

8 This is a very odd system where you have to immediately

9 go to the constitutional claim and you're foreclosed

10 from looking at the statutory claim.

11 MR. STEWART: I -- I agree that it's an

12 unusual system, but I think it -- and in a sense the

13 same situation would have been present in Webster v.

14 Doe, that is, the Court, when it came to review the

15 merits of the constitutional challenge, wouldn't have

16 had any possibility of deciding the case on a non-

17 constitutional basis because non-constitutional

18 challenges would be foreclosed.

19 Now --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your position on

21 the statute was that it doesn't afford a right of

22 action, that it was just an instruction to the

23 Secretary. Maybe I misread your position on the

24 statute. We're talking about 45-1048?

25 MR. STEWART: Yes.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the

2 Government's position was there's no right of action

3 under that statute.

4 MR. STEWART: There's no private right of

5 action conferred by 45-108 itself. Now, in the

6 ordinary case, when a Federal statute places limits on

7 agency personnel and a particular category of

8 plaintiffs falls within the zone of interest that was

9 intended to be protected by that provision, then even

10 if the statute that limits agency discretion itself

11 doesn't provide a private right of action, the

12 Administrative Procedure Act would entitle a claimant

13 to get into court and argue that the agency's decision

14 was contrary to law, namely the relevant statute. So

15 if there were no question of CSRA conclusion, we would

16 agree that the claimant could go into court raising a

17 statutory challenge notwithstanding the absence of a

18 private right of action in 45-108 itself.

19 Here, we think that the evidence from the

20 comprehensive congressional scheme is sufficient to

21 divest the courts of jurisdiction over the statutory

22 claim. We don't think that Congress has spoken with

23 the clarity that this Court has required to divest the

24 courts of jurisdiction over the constitutional

25 challenge.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, as to that, if -- if

2 there were a petitioner with some constitutional claim

3 -- let's not get into the debate about significant or

4 non-significant -- covered by the collective

5 bargaining agreement, you say the petitioner can't go

6 to court with the constitutional claim unless he first

7 persuades the union to seek arbitration.

8 MR. STEWART: No. We're saying that he first

9 has to attempt to persuade the union to seek

10 arbitration. That is, he has to make all reasonable

11 efforts to utilize the full range of administrative

12 remedies. But it -- our -- our position is if the

13 union declines that request, then judicial review would

14 be available at the end of the day in Federal district

15 court.

16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: All right. Now, did you

17 raise the exhaustion claim? Did the Government raise

18 it in the lower courts?

19 MR. STEWART: We didn't characterize it as an

20 exhaustion argument. That is, the district court

21 alluded to the petitioner's failure to exhaust in

22 dismissing the suit. However, we -- this is not a case

23 in which we have, up to this point, litigated the

24 merits of the Fourth Amendment dispute and then

25 switched to a threshold objection to adjudication.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 We've always argued that the suit was barred by the

2 CSRA scheme, and we've always pointed out that the

3 petitioner did not take advantage of the administrative

4 remedies that were available to him.

5 Really, the only change in our position is

6 that we have been in the -- in this Court have been

7 willing to acknowledge that in the hypothetical case

8 where someone in petitioner's position did make -- take

9 full advantage or make reasonable efforts to take full

10 advantage of the administrative processes, that

11 judicial review would be available.

12 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So I guess

13 you're saying, as to the constitutional claim, it's

14 obvious they have to exhaust.

15 There's no reason why they don't have to

16 exhaust in respect to the 12th test, which has already

17 occurred, and in respect to the 15th, which might be

18 threatened, if it does come about that it's threatened,

19 they can go in, I guess, under 705 of the APA and ask

20 for an injunction. Any reason they couldn't do that?

21 MR. STEWART: Well, they would first have to

22 get into court first. They would first --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. What they do is

24 they follow, like any other agency action. An agency

25 action has taken place. I think it's unconstitutional

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 or you do. We exhaust our remedies and then get to

2 court at the end of the day and make our claim.

3 An agency action is threatened. I am

4 threatened with irreparable injury. I can go to court,

5 I think, at the time it's threatened, and say I want a

6 protective order. I think 705 provides for that

7 specifically. And -- and, therefore, I'm protected. I

8 can't imagine why they couldn't do that if they have a

9 -- not just a plausible, but a -- a good claim that it

10 does violate the Constitution and they need the

11 protection. Is there any reason they couldn't?

12 MR. STEWART: I -- I mean, again with the

13 caveat they would first have to avail themselves of the

14 administrative --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: No, they wouldn't. Their

16 point is that the very -- availing myself of the

17 administrative remedy will work irreparable harm of --

18 in violation of my constitutional right. Now, maybe

19 that's not true, but let's imagine it's true. Then

20 couldn't they go in and ask for a protective order? I

21 thought that you could do that, but I might be wrong.

22 MR. STEWART: I mean, I think you're --

23 you're correct that you could do that in the general

24 run of cases under the administrative --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. And is there any

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 reason that they shouldn't be able to do that here?

2 Because they are going to say that -- I don't know they

3 ever can make it out in this case, but they are going

4 to say that my having to go ahead with the number --

5 test number 15, which, by the way, may never be

6 threatened, but if it is, it will, the very fact that I

7 have to do it, violate an important constitutional

8 right that I need to have protected before undergoing

9 the text -- the test.

10 MR. STEWART: No. In -- in our view, in

11 harmonizing the -- the principle that judicial review

12 --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

14 MR. STEWART: -- will ordinarily be available

15 for a constitutional claim with the remedial scheme

16 established by the CSRA --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: You think they could not do

18 that under 705. So there is a difference between you

19 on that.

20 As to the statutory claim, I mean, I find --

21 but others may disagree with this. It's my personal

22 view that the notion of private right of action in this

23 area simply mixes things up. It's apples and oranges.

24 It has nothing to do with anything. That if a person,

25 in fact, is adversely affected or aggrieved by a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Government action, he usually, almost always, indeed,

2 can get judicial review eventually. But what you're

3 saying there I take it is that may be so, but this

4 impliedly says no.

5 MR. STEWART: That's correct.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, my question is do we

7 have to decide that. Because, after all, this

8 individual may get relief through the statutory

9 procedures that you admit are provided by asking for

10 grievance arbitration. He may, the first time he asks

11 for it, be given a piece of paper that shows him he

12 wasn't hurt. Or he may have been hurt, and they'll say

13 we don't it again. There are a lot of things that can

14 happen.

15 Do we have to decide the issue today of

16 whether if he goes to the union, the union says we

17 won't arbitrate, or they say we will and they lose and

18 it isn't as an unfair labor practice -- do we have to

19 decide that issue as to whether a person in those

20 circumstances can then subsequently go into court?

21 MR. STEWART: No. I think you could

22 certainly decide the case on the ground that an

23 individual who has made no effort to utilize the

24 grievance procedures that are available under the

25 collective bargaining agreement, can't bypass those

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 procedures entirely by filing suit into -- in Federal

2 district court. And it wouldn't be necessary for the

3 Court to resolve --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: So we have to say the easier

5 matter is it's clear that as to such matters, you must

6 exhaust. It's so clear that there is no reason for us

7 to decide whether there is an implied repeal of the

8 right at the end of some days to -- to judicial review,

9 a matter which is disfavored in the law.

10 MR. STEWART: Well, certainly to -- I mean,

11 that is, justifiably to impose an exhaustion

12 requirement, the Court would have to find that the --

13 the exhaustion principle is in some sense implicit in

14 the CSRA.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: I might. My -- so I don't

16 know why it wouldn't be.

17 MR. STEWART: And I think that there's ample

18 basis for the Court to do that -- that is, one of the

19 noteworthy features of the CSRA is that the act

20 authorizes judicial review of a wide category of

21 Government actions in different courts under different

22 circumstances. But there's no provision of the CSRA

23 that ever gives a plaintiff a right of immediate access

24 to a Federal district court. That is --

25 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, is -- is -- should

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it be a little bit of a concern to us that the lower

2 court didn't address it? Should it be sent back to

3 look at this exhaustion notion?

4 MR. STEWART: I mean, I think it's clear --

5 it -- it is clear and undisputed that the plaintiff was

6 advised by the FLRA that the grievance procedure was

7 his available remedy and declined to invoke even the

8 initial step of the grievance procedure, and therefore

9 --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was on the view

11 that it was an exclusive remedy. The -- the statute is

12 not written in -- in any way as an exhaustion

13 requirement. It says you've got a minor grievance --

14 issue. You go through the grievance procedure. There

15 is no judicial review at the end of the line. So you

16 would be converting something that Congress wrote to be

17 an exclusive remedy into an exhaustion requirement.

18 MR. STEWART: But I think -- I think that's

19 why I said earlier that there was some element of

20 untidiness to our position. That is, we're not

21 contending that this was precisely the scheme that

22 Congress envisioned.

23 But our -- our -- the Court's task, I

24 believe, is to reconcile Congress' apparent intent --

25 attempt to construct a comprehensive scheme that --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you -- you have picked

2 one way to do that. You say go through the grievance

3 procedure. If there's a constitutional question

4 remaining, if you haven't been satisfied, then you

5 bring the action in court.

6 Another way to say is, well, as long as we're

7 making this up, why not allow the -- the action to

8 proceed at once in court, but then the court to say,

9 I'm going to abstain while you go through the grievance

10 procedure.

11 MR. STEWART: I -- I mean, I guess we would --

12 we would resist the notion that we're making it all up.

13 That is, whenever Congress -- whenever this Court

14 attempts to harmonize two distinct statutes to make

15 them -- in order that they would make sense taken

16 together, the result is likely to be that neither

17 statute will be read in precisely --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, I --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the second statute?

20 There's no second statute here. There -- there is your

21 concession of the fact that there has to be judicial

22 review. That's what's driving all of this. And -- and

23 generally speaking, when we find something to be

24 unconstitutional, we don't rewrite a statute so that it

25 will be constitutional. We just say, you know, there

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 has to be judicial review.

2 MR. STEWART: There is a -- a second statute,

3 and it's the Administrative Procedure Act, which would

4 generally allow an individual who is aggrieved by

5 Federal Government action to file suit in court. And

6 the question is whether Congress has manifested with

7 sufficient clarity its intent to divest the court of

8 jurisdiction under the --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, if you assume

10 the APA is the remedy -- we're talking about a district

11 court procedure -- how would you describe the final

12 agency action that would be challenged in that lawsuit?

13 MR. STEWART: I mean, it really depends upon

14 the extent to which -- it really depends on where the

15 administrative procedures go. That is, the APA is --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let's assume that the -- he

17 seeks a grievance, and the union refuses to grieve.

18 And then he then goes into -- into district court under

19 the APA. What would the final agency action be in your

20 view?

21 MR. STEWART: The final -- it's -- it's a

22 little bit hard to define. It would in some sense be

23 --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Very hard to define. 


25 MR. STEWART: It -- it would in some sense be 


1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the allegedly unconstitutional drug test that he's

2 already been required to take.

3 One of the things that makes this --

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: So what would his relief

5 be? He can untake it.

6 MR. STEWART: Exactly. And one -- one of the

7 --

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because he can't damages

9 under the APA.

10 MR. STEWART: One of the things that makes

11 this tricky is that under this Court's decision of City

12 of Los Angeles v. Lyons, if an individual is subjected

13 to allegedly unconstitutional conduct but has no reason

14 to believe that it will happen to him again and damages

15 are unavailable, then the -- there is no standing to

16 seek injunctive --

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but here, that's

18 not this case because he said, and when I complained,

19 they did it again.

20 MR. STEWART: That's right. And I think in a

21 sense what you could say is the -- the agency action

22 that he would be complaining about in the APA suit is

23 not so much the past drug test, it would be the

24 threatened or ostensibly threatened drug test. And his

25 basis for believing that they were, in fact, likely to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 occur is that he had been subjected to unconstitutional

2 drug tests in the past.

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's not a final

4 agency action. The threat of another test isn't a

5 final agency action, is it?

6 MR. STEWART: I would certainly think that if

7 -- if there were no question of CSRA preclusion, if we

8 were just looking at the APA standing alone, and an

9 individual said they've done this unconstitutional

10 thing to me time after time, my supervisor has

11 ransacked my office time and again or FBI agents have

12 shown up at my door every day and have insisted on

13 searching, I think even if damages were unavailable for

14 the prior unlawful actions, at some point we would say

15 the likelihood of repetition is sufficiently imminent

16 that a right of action should be available in court.

17 And -- but again, I think all of these are

18 perhaps potential alternative bases on which this

19 complaint could have been dismissed, but it doesn't

20 alter the fact that an adequate basis for dismissal was

21 the failure to invoke the grievance procedures

22 available under the CSRA and the collective bargaining

23 agreement.

24 And I think it's not simply a -- to say that

25 it's simply a question of when the individual can file

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 suit is to presuppose that the grievance procedures

2 won't work. And there's no reason to assume that that

3 will happen. That is, Congress manifested -- Congress

4 in the CSRA enacted congressional findings to the

5 effect that collective bargaining and -- and union

6 activity in the public sector are in the public

7 interest. It specifically required that collective

8 bargaining agreements under the CSRA should contain

9 grievance procedures for the resolution of disputes,

10 and I think --

11 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: If the dispute were to go

12 to arbitration -- there are very limited provisions for

13 judicial review in the event there is a decision --

14 could the constitutional claim still go to court?

15 MR. STEWART: The constitutional claim could

16 go to court, and what -- what we've sketched out in the

17 brief is two alternative routes for judicial review in

18 the event that the grievance was processed to its

19 conclusion, that is, a finding by the FLRA.

20 On the one hand, it would be possible to

21 invoke the provision of the CSRA that specifically

22 refers to judicial review of FLRA decisions generally,

23 and that provides for review either in the regional

24 courts of appeals or in the D.C. Circuit.

25 However, it -- there is a difficulty with the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 statutory language in the sense that that provision

2 that authorizes court of appeals review specifically

3 excludes FLRA decisions on grievances. And therefore,

4 if the Court felt like that sort of tweaking of the

5 statutory language was just too much to tolerate, then

6 the available remedy would be in the Federal district

7 court.

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I right that the

9 statute as written says you don't have any judicial

10 review for these kinds of actions? You go through the

11 grievance procedure, win or lose. That's it. There is

12 no judicial review.

13 MR. STEWART: It doesn't say you have no

14 judicial review. It -- the -- the provision that would

15 otherwise authorize judicial review in the courts of

16 appeals of FLRA actions is made inapplicable to

17 grievance procedures.

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The statute does not

19 provide for judicial review --

20 MR. STEWART: Exactly, but the --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- as it does in the case

22 of major actions.

23 MR. STEWART: But the statute -- the CSRA

24 does not say -- does not purport to divest the courts

25 of the authority that they would otherwise have under

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 different statutes to adjudicate challenges to

2 employment decisions. Now --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stewart, if -- if we're

4 going to tweak the statute, isn't the least possible

5 tweak -- and perhaps not a tweak at all -- simply to

6 consider this a personnel action?

7 MR. STEWART: If the Court --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if a decision to order

9 psychiatric testing can be one, why can't a decision to

10 require drug testing be one?

11 MR. STEWART: That -- that would be a

12 possible tweak. I'm not sure if it would --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure it's a tweak at

14 all. It -- it just depends on -- on what you consider

15 to be working conditions. And in -- in many contexts,

16 we've given the broadest possible interpretation to

17 working conditions.

18 MR. STEWART: I think that would be a basis

19 for dismissal in this case. I was going to say I'm not

20 sure whether that would solve the problem from

21 petitioner's standpoint because --

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it would mean

23 you don't get into court at all then. Right?

24 MR. STEWART: It would -- the -- the remedy

25 for a -- an alleged prohibited personnel practice --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and, I think, an unconstitutional personnel action

2 would be a prohibited personnel practice under the

3 statute. The remedy for that is to complain to the

4 Office of Special Counsel. Now, if the Office of

5 Special Counsel seeks corrective action with the Merit

6 Systems Protection Board and the MSPB issues a decision

7 unfavorable to the employee, then the employee, under

8 the terms of the CSRA itself, can seek judicial review

9 of the MSPB's decision in the Federal Circuit. So

10 there would be a potential route --

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even in the -- even

12 if it's not a major personnel action?

13 MR. STEWART: Yes, if -- again, if the OSC

14 asked for a corrective action in the MSPB. Now, if the

15 OSC processes the complaint and concludes either that

16 the factual allegations are unsubstantiated or that the

17 allegations, even if true, wouldn't constitute a

18 prohibited personnel practice and terminates the

19 investigation on that basis, there's no avenue for

20 judicial review under the terms of the CSRA of the --

21 the OSC's decision to dismiss the complaint. So I

22 think that the -- the route you've sketched out might,

23 at the end of the day, lead to judicial review without

24 any tweaking of the statute. But if the OSC dismissed

25 the complaint, we would still be left with the problem

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: What their brief says is

3 that they can go on a personnel, as opposed to major

4 personnel, to the OSC if, and only if, the complaint

5 has to do with whistleblowing.

6 MR. STEWART: That's correct. And that --

7 that's --

8 JUSTICE BREYER: And this doesn't have to do

9 with whistleblowing.

10 MR. STEWART: That -- that's correct.

11 JUSTICE BREYER: And therefore, even if this

12 were a personnel action, that route to the OSC is not

13 open to them.

14 MR. STEWART: That -- that is the position

15 that they've taken in the brief. The position of the

16 --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that true? What do you think?

18 MR. STEWART: -- the position of the OSC and

19 the Department of Justice is that OSC's jurisdiction

20 over FAA employees is not limited to whistleblower

21 complaints.

22 Now -- now, it's clear that in the run of

23 complaints, with respect to employees of other Federal

24 agencies, I don't think there's any dispute between the

25 parties that OSC's jurisdiction would extend beyond

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 whistleblower complaints. The -- the only point of

2 dispute is with respect to the FAA.

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, let me just be

4 sure I understand. In the Government's view, is it a

5 personnel action or is it not?

6 MR. STEWART: No, it's not. And indeed, in

7 footnote 28 of this Court's decision in Bush v. Lucas,

8 the Court specifically identified warrantless searches

9 as an example of conduct in which an employer might

10 engage towards its employees that would not constitute

11 a personnel action. And we think that's good authority

12 for the proposition that an allegedly unconstitutional

13 drug test is not a personnel action.

14 Now, if the employee had refused to take the

15 test and been dismissed or disciplined, that would be a

16 personnel action.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I --

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in those circuits

19 which allow these cases to go to courts, has there been

20 any indication that the courts are flooded with a

21 number of these cases or --

22 MR. STEWART: Not -- no, not that I'm aware

23 of. Obviously, in -- in other circuits, we prevailed

24 on the -- the theory that the CSRA precludes review

25 even of constitutional claims.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And again, if I could return just for a

2 moment to the -- the point I was making earlier about

3 the grievance procedure. Congress has clearly

4 manifested a preference for the inclusion of grievance

5 procedures in collective bargaining agreements, and --

6 and given that express congressional preference, it

7 doesn't seem right for this Court to assume that the

8 grievance procedures won't work.

9 And this seems to be an ideal example of a

10 case that potentially implicates constitutional issues

11 but that still falls squarely within the expertise of

12 the union, the arbitrator, and the FLRA. That is, the

13 dispute here concerns whether, in fact, petitioner was

14 tested more frequently than his colleagues, and if so,

15 what was the explanation? Was it simply random

16 deviations? Was it potentially a -- a glitch in the

17 computer program that was used to generate a random

18 list of names, or was there some invidious motivation

19 as -- as petitioner has suggested? The resolution of

20 those types of questions falls entirely within the

21 expertise of the participants in the grievance process

22 even though constitutional law per se is not what labor

23 arbitrators are best at.

24 And so, I guess to -- to return for a second

25 to -- to Justice Scalia's question about why shouldn't

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

56

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the CSRA be read to preclude judicial review of

2 constitutional claims altogether. I mean, we certainly

3 think that if -- in a sense, that's -- that's a debate

4 we would be happy to lose. That is, the Government has

5 not suggested that we have an affirmative interest in

6 preserving judicial review of those claims, and if the

7 Court were looking for a -- the simplest solution to

8 the problem, that solution would be -- have just as

9 much to recommend it as petitioner's solution, which is

10 that you go straight into Federal district court.

11 However, we don't think that Congress has

12 spoken with the degree of clarity that this Court's

13 decisions demand to preclude all judicial review of

14 constitutional challenges, and we think the best way of

15 reconciling that presumption of judicial review with

16 the comprehensive nature of the CSRA scheme is to

17 provide that claims -- constitutional claims are

18 reviewable if, and only if, the plaintiff has made all

19 reasonable efforts to utilize the available

20 administrative remedies.

21 If the Court has no further questions.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

23 Stewart.

24 Ms. Karlan, you have 4 minutes remaining.

25 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

57
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

2 MS. KARLAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

3 please the Court:

4 I -- I think it's clear at this point that

5 the Government really is asking this Court to rewrite

6 the CSRA on the fly. As late as page 48 of their brief

7 on the merits, they wouldn't tell us whether our client

8 should go to Federal district court or to the court of

9 appeals. Then in response to Justice Scalia's

10 question, they say, well, you could rewrite

11 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi) and (x). And I think the CSRA is a

12 sufficiently detailed and comprehensive statute that

13 this Court has resisted rewriting several times.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: But it's not rewriting. I

15 mean -- I mean, it's perhaps.

16 MS. KARLAN: It is.

17 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. You think --

18 fine.

19 The -- the -- but the -- the issue it seems

20 that could be dispositive of this, in respect to the

21 non-constitutional claims -- and this is why I want to

22 get your response -- is simply that it is a fair

23 implication from Congress having set up on non-

24 constitutional matters a system of arbitration to

25 require your client to go through that system before

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

58

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 seeking to get review of the non-constitutional matters

2 in a Federal district court. Now, that's the normal

3 rule in administrative law. What is the argument that

4 it wouldn't apply in your case?

5 MS. KARLAN: That the system of collective

6 bargaining negotiated grievance processes here is set

7 up in a way that does not filter it into judicial

8 review. And therefore -- in 1994, when Congress

9 amended section --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: Now you want us to hold you

11 don't have judicial review --

12 MS. KARLAN: No, no.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: -- under the statute.

14 MS. KARLAN: No, Your Honor. We think that

15 that goes straight under the APA.

16 Now, here's the real problem with the

17 Government --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but the answer --

19 please, I didn't mean to cut off your answer.

20 MS. KARLAN: I know.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: I want to hear your answer

22 to the question that if I agree with you that on non-

23 constitutional matters, if this system doesn't work for

24 your client, he gets review in a Federal district

25 court. Suppose I agree with you on that. What is the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

59

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 argument against requiring him to exhaust the remedy

2 that is there, namely a request for arbitration --

3 MS. KARLAN: The argument against it --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: -- as an implication from

5 the statute?

6 MS. KARLAN: The argument against it in this

7 case, which stems, from among other things, this

8 Court's decision in Zipes against TWA and in Heckler

9 against Day, is the Government waived any claim that

10 our client should have been required to exhaust. They

11 never raised that issue below, and this Court has

12 repeatedly held that a failure to raise a non-

13 exhaustion defense is waiver of that defense. You

14 should wait until you have a case where there has been

15 briefing and factfinding.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, is there

17 any other claim -- any other answer to the argument

18 other than they waived it?

19 MS. KARLAN: Yes.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: What?

21 MS. KARLAN: And that is that when Congress

22 amended 7121(a) in 1994, they amended it to make clear

23 that it had no effect on judicial causes of action that

24 arose from elsewhere. That's what the insertion of the

25 word administrative there was done. It was not done in

1 order to create an exhaustion regime, but rather, to

2 eliminate a preclusion regime. And we set this out

3 quite carefully in our brief, as do the two union

4 amici, as to what the purpose of the grievance

5 procedure is here. It is not to create an exhaustion

6 regime and certainly not to create an exhaustion regime

7 with what the Government, at least, concedes under the

8 statute, as now written, is not a personnel action.

9 That is, the CSRA is quite comprehensive with

10 regard to personnel actions, but it leaves to

11 traditional sources of judicial enforcement things that

12 are not personnel actions. And as this Court's opinion

13 in Bush against Lucas makes absolutely clear, a

14 warrantless search of the kind to which our client was

15 subjected is not a personnel action and, therefore, is

16 not within the comprehensive scheme of the CSRA for

17 dealing with personnel actions.

18 Thank you.

19 JUSTICE BREYER: Did I -- could you give --

20 give the same answer --

21 MS. KARLAN: Absolutely.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: -- in respect to your

23 constitutional claim? Why, given the presence of

24 section 705 of the act --

25 MS. KARLAN: Well, we --
