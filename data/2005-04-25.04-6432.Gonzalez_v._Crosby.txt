2 (11:05 a.m.)

3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument

4 now in Aurelio Gonzalez v. James Crosby.

5 Mr. Rashkind.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. RASHKIND

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8 MR. RASHKIND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10 We confront today the Eleventh Circuit's

11 categorical and jurisdictional prohibition of rule 60(b)

12 in habeas corpus cases absent fraud. That is a rule that

13 has been rejected by nearly all of the other circuits and,

14 in fact, has been rejected by the United States in its

15 amicus brief filed in this case.

16 We urge the Court to adopt instead the approach

17 of the other nine circuits that have commented on this

18 issue, the functional approach, in which a court is deemed

19 to examine each motion individually to determine whether

20 or not the motion comports with both rule 60(b) and AEDPA.

21 I think the test we proposed here is a fairly

22 simple one, although I'm not sure in the briefing it comes

23 across as being as simple as it really is, but the test we

24 are proposing, as opposed to the test proposed by the

25 United States, is the one being used in nearly all of the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 other circuits and it has percolated through the system as

2 one that seems to work very well. It's a two-part test

3 and it's very simple I think.

4 First, does the motion that's filed challenge

5 the Federal judgment on a ground cognizable under one of

6 the six prongs of rule 60(b)? If not, if it's really a

7 new claim, if it is not within one of the six prongs of

8 rule 60(b), then simply the district court denies it.

9 If, on the other hand, the motion is a true

10 60(b) motion, as ours was in this case, then the court

11 goes to step two, which is to examine which is the six

12 prongs is implicated, what is the jurisprudence regarding

13 the six -- that particular prong, and how would it apply

14 in this particular case. That's the functional approach

15 that most of the circuits have been using.

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: At that point when the court

17 makes that examination under your rule and it comes to

18 point six --

19 MR. RASHKIND: Yes.

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- does it refer at any point

21 or in any circumstance to AEDPA?

22 MR. RASHKIND: It does not but -- but point six

23 has been cabined by jurisprudence. Although point six

24 appears to be a wide-open door for any motion to be filed

25 and granted, the courts, even before AEDPA, have treated

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 category six as one that requires extraordinary

2 circumstances.

3 We have been able to quantify. Both an amicus

4 who filed on behalf of the petitioner and the United

5 States and the respondent have quantified the number of

6 cases that have gone through the rule 60(b) process.

7 There have only been, since AEDPA was passed, 28

8 successful motions that we can quantify, that are

9 published in any way. And we would like to think, at

10 least, that if the State or the Federal Government thought

11 there was an inappropriate application, it would have been

12 raised on appeal and we'd have that statistic. 28 in the

13 9-year history of the statute means fewer than 3 per year

14 -- or slightly more than 3 per year for the whole country,

15 a fraction for circuits.

16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if we were to make

17 clear that 60(b) is widely available, even category six,

18 don't you think -- and as a result the AEDPA restrictions

19 don't apply, don't you think that number would increase

20 rather dramatically?

21 MR. RASHKIND: I do not. And I do not because

22 at this point apparently nine circuits are following the

23 rule we propose, and so the statistics that both the

24 respondent that we bring to you are that small, are that

25 infinitesimal because the courts have always treated 60(b)

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 as a last ditch, extraordinary circumstances required.

2 One can go through each of the six prongs and easily

3 hypothesize examples that are appropriate, (b)(1),

4 (b)(2) --

5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, there's no language in

6 category six referring to extraordinary circumstances, any

7 other reason justifying relief.

8 MR. RASHKIND: The Court in the Ackermann

9 decision -- there were two early decisions construing

10 60(b). The first was the Klapprott decision in which the

11 Court recognized that 60(b) is intended to correct the

12 kind of errors that might occur that are important. The

13 Ackermann decision followed a year later and said,

14 however, this is not a wide-open door. Extraordinary

15 circumstances are required.

16 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But it's still very

17 vague.

18 MR. RASHKIND: It is but it isn't. It's vague

19 in terms of reading the simple rule, but it's not vague if

20 one considers the jurisprudence that surrounds the rule.

21 One cannot ignore a half-century of -- of decisions, which

22 have rejected 60(b)(6) and other 60(b) --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: All that is true, but I think

24 that the court below and the other parties say -- almost

25 everybody is on your side. However, they also note a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 problem, and the problem is that given the very rigid

2 structure of AEDPA and the imagination of lawyers, that if

3 60(b) hasn't proved an escape hatch for getting around the

4 AEDPA restriction, it will, and that what the lawyers will

5 do is they will reconstruct what they'd like as a second

6 habeas and put it in the form of a 60(b).

7 And so I can accept everything you say, but if

8 that in the back of my mind is a concern running around

9 Congress in this way, what form of words could you put in

10 to restrict 60(b) to its domain which is the domain in

11 which it's been used so far?

12 Now, the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation filed

13 a brief in which they tried to do that. I thought that

14 was a constructive effort. So what's your opinion --

15 MR. RASHKIND: Well, I would --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: -- about how best to do that?

17 MR. RASHKIND: I would prefer to rely upon the

18 Court's principles in this regard.

19 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but that's --

20 MR. RASHKIND: Rhines -- Rhines v. Weber is of

21 good help here. Rhines v. Weber, that the Court delivered

22 just very recently, considered the interaction of a rule

23 and of AEDPA, and I thought it very clearly set forth

24 three principles which work well within the test here.

25 First, that there has to be good cause and good

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 cause, of course, is clear in the jurisprudence here, that

2 we're talking about extraordinary circumstances, not a

3 simple legal error. In this case, for example, the

4 extraordinary circumstance is that, for all intents and

5 purposes, my client has been denied his first petition of

6 right because the court foreclosed the issues erroneously.

7 So good cause is the first thing that I learned from

8 Rhines.

9 Secondly, that there have to be potentially

10 meritorious underlying issues. Now, that's going to

11 filter out a lot of the cases because you can't come into

12 court with another issue that might not be good, it

13 mightn't be an unexhausted issue, it might be --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's pretty flabby.

15 MR. RASHKIND: -- one procedurally defaulted.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's pretty flabby.

17 Potentially meritorious? Not probably, potentially.

18 MR. RASHKIND: Well, it is -- it is the

19 terminology used in Rhines. And what I'm trying to do

20 here for the Court is to draw upon your own authority, the

21 words you've spoken, as opposed to the test proposed by

22 the Criminal Justice Foundation and by the United States,

23 which are interesting tests but in no way depend upon the

24 Court's own jurisprudence. I'm trying to offer the Court

25 its own tests that have worked.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But this is going to

2 be taken up by some 800 district judges and a couple

3 hundred appellate judges, and they're the ones who have

4 the final say in most of these cases just because we

5 decide so few.

6 MR. RASHKIND: And I think that's why this test

7 works.

8 The third point would be that there be

9 timeliness.

10 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, aren't we dealing here

11 with a time bar issue?

12 MR. RASHKIND: We are.

13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I mean, there -- there was

14 not a determination below, but an extraordinary amount of

15 time expired before the application was made. Why would

16 that count as some extraordinary circumstance? Why

17 shouldn't the petitioner be stuck with the time bar? I

18 don't see how this fits even under your proposed rule.

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to ask the same

20 question. It's about as pedestrian an issue as you could

21 get. It comes up all the time. I mean, this is not a

22 cosmic legal issue.

23 MR. RASHKIND: It really isn't as pedestrian as

24 it may have seemed. We underwent a change in the law, in

25 AEDPA, that the Court has recognized is not fully clear.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And so this was one provision the Court had to clarify in

2 Artuz v. Bennett, and there was a very small number of

3 cases. I think we totaled eight in which relief was

4 granted because district courts had incorrectly barred a

5 petitioner from the first petition because it really

6 wasn't a violation of -- of the statute of limitations.

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- why did Florida deny

8 relief in -- in the post-conviction? I mean, one reason

9 that looks like it might apply is that Florida had a 2-

10 year statute of limitations and this was brought up 14

11 years later.

12 MR. RASHKIND: Well, it wasn't a 2-year statute

13 of limitations, Your Honor. In fact, it was slightly

14 different from the Federal statute of limitations as well.

15 There is a provision that allows for newly discovered

16 evidence to bypass the standard 2-year statute of

17 limitations, which by the way, the Florida statute of

18 limitations wasn't even adopted until well after my client

19 was convicted.

20 As you know, he says that he was told at his

21 sentencing proceeding, you'll serve 13 years, thereabouts,

22 on a 99-year sentence, and that induced his plea of guilty

23 in this case. And when 13 years came about, he inquired

24 what's happening and they said, no, that's not going to

25 happen. You have a release date of 2057.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And as I think the Court knows from its decision

2 in Linz v. Mathis, Florida -- Florida statutes really

3 changed in that way. Gain time was reduced gradually and

4 then much more quickly so that someone who might have

5 served 13 years in 1982 is really looking at serving the

6 99.

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying that counsel

8 -- what -- what he alleges counsel told him was, in fact,

9 accurate at the time counsel said it, that somebody who

10 got a 99-year sentence wouldn't have to serve more than 13

11 years?

12 MR. RASHKIND: To be clear -- and -- and I want

13 to be clear about his allegation is -- because he does not

14 speak English -- that the interpreter told him this, and

15 this was not during a plea colloquy. This was during

16 discussions between the lawyer and the client through an

17 interpreter in advance of the plea itself. And so his

18 allegation has consistently been that that's what the

19 interpreter told him his lawyer said.

20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But has that been

21 determined --

22 MR. RASHKIND: No.

23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- by some court? That's the

24 allegation --

25 MR. RASHKIND: Correct.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- pure and simple --

2 MR. RASHKIND: Correct.

3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- yet to be determined.

4 MR. RASHKIND: And it's never been.

5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And so we have to know how

6 the time bar element folds in here, and in an ordinary

7 civil case, a time bar would be an adjudication on the

8 merits. I mean, that -- that would end the case, and why

9 would it be a different, more liberal rule in habeas?

10 MR. RASHKIND: It is because that's the way the

11 Court has treated the rule. The Court has always --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're -- you're saying it

13 is extraordinary.

14 MR. RASHKIND: In a different sense I'm saying

15 it. In terms of computing whether a time bar is on the

16 merits, the Court has not used that concept, which does

17 relate to some sort of civil proceedings. Plaut would

18 make it appear first to money judgment type cases. But

19 the Court has not used that standard, for example, in

20 Martinez-Villareal, has not used it in Slack v. McDaniel.

21 Instead, the Court has not looked at the

22 nomenclature of the order that dismissed the case or

23 denied this case. Instead, the Court looks to did the --

24 the court below address the claims of the petitioner. And

25 of course, a claim of statute of limitations is not a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 claim of a petitioner. That's an affirmative defense of

2 the State.

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Counsel, what -- that --

4 that brings me to a question that I don't understand about

5 your argument. It seems to me you're biting off more than

6 you have to bite off here. Would you win on the following

7 argument? And I will tell you in advance that it looks to

8 me as though you would. But maybe there's some reason

9 you're not making it.

10 Number one, your statute of limitations claim is

11 not the kind of claim that AEDPA is concerned with when it

12 deals with limits on second and successive petitions.

13 Number two, although a statute of limitations

14 issue is on the merits, it is not on the merits in the

15 second or successive petition category. In this case, you

16 don't have to worry about making a -- an -- an AEDPA end

17 run so far as second or successive goes, and therefore,

18 60(b) can be used simply not as a wide-open door, but as a

19 door that could be opened when your claim is a claim about

20 a rule that barred you from getting into Federal court,

21 which is what the statute of limitations rule does.

22 That's all you're asking for.

23 MR. RASHKIND: That's right.

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: And finally, you have an

25 extraordinary situation here because you have a later

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 determination in Artuz which declared the law not as a

2 change in the law, but as what the law presumably meant

3 from day one.

4 As I understand it, if we accepted that

5 argument, you would win. Do you agree?

6 MR. RASHKIND: Yes, sir.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why don't you make that

8 argument?

9 MR. RASHKIND: I do make that argument, and to

10 the extent -- and -- and I make that argument, but that

11 argument was rejected in the court below which addressed

12 it with a completely different approach. And so I begin

13 in this Court by having to address where I was in the

14 Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you go back to the

16 district court before the Eleventh Circuit? You've now

17 told me that the ground on which the Florida court denied

18 relief was not based on the statute of limitations.

19 Right?

20 MR. RASHKIND: Correct.

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the Federal court, what is

22 the ground on which relief was denied and how would Artuz

23 affect that decision?

24 MR. RASHKIND: In the Federal court, the

25 district judge said that the tolling provision would not

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 apply here because it was the district court's

2 determination that it was untimely when filed in the State

3 court. That was not, however, the position of the Florida

4 courts.

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but your -- your immediate

6 concern is how do I get into a Federal court. Whether you

7 win or lose once you get in there is another problem, but

8 I -- as I understand it, that's not what we're dealing

9 with here. And -- and the -- you -- you were kept out of

10 the district court on a statute of limitations issue. If

11 you can say -- if you argue all I've got in front of you,

12 us, is a statute of limitations issue, that's all I want

13 under -- to raise under 60(b) and I have an extraordinary

14 claim here because of the subsequent Artuz decision, that

15 will get you into Federal court, if we accept that

16 argument. Whether -- whether you win or lose, once you

17 get there, I don't know, and I don't know that that's

18 before us.

19 MR. RASHKIND: And it is not clear. I wish it

20 were because that's precisely what my pro se client wrote

21 in his rule 60(b) motion. He said I have been denied my

22 right to a first petition because of an incorrect

23 determination on the statute of limitations, that the

24 Artuz decision makes clear that I was entitled to a

25 tolling period that I was not awarded, and I would like

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the judgment modified or reopened. And that's as clear as

2 a pro se litigant can make that claim. That's what the

3 claim has been from the very beginning, long before I was

4 ever his counsel.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: You -- you had a question.

6 Remember my -- you were giving me the three principles to

7 prevent the end run.

8 MR. RASHKIND: Yes.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: And the first was good cause.

10 The second was potentially meritorious underlying issues,

11 and the third is?

12 MR. RASHKIND: No indication of dilatory tactics

13 by the plaintiff.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.

15 MR. RASHKIND: And this is very helpful I think

16 because it gives those three rules, which the Court has

17 given us in Rhines, helped us and helped the district

18 court to sort out the things that shouldn't be stopping or

19 reopening proceedings.

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: May -- may I ask you a

21 question that may be a little bit collateral? There was

22 disagreement on the court of appeals, as I remember it, as

23 to whether or not a COA requirement applies to a denial of

24 a 60(b) motion. What is your view on that issue?

25 MR. RASHKIND: Well, I actually argued and I do

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 believe that it shouldn't require a COA. And the reason

2 is because -- part of the reason is because this case

3 began before Slack v. McDaniel and continued after. And I

4 think that's where Judge Tjoflat's opinion came from. How

5 can someone whose case is dismissed procedurally ever get

6 a COA? It's impossible because there's never going to be

7 a constitutional issue. By virtue of the procedural

8 ruling, the constitutional was not addressed.

9 And Judge Tjoflat continued that dissenting

10 position through the en banc decision, and I share the

11 view that it is virtually impossible, if not completely

12 impossible, in the typical case of a procedural resolution

13 of the case, to ever get a COA.

14 In this case, majority would point to the

15 fact the my client did receive a certificate of

16 appealability, but I don't think there are many others who

17 will every get it because the question presented was, is a

18 rule 60(b) still viable post AEDPA? And that question

19 won't recur, certainly not after the Court rules here.

20 And I think the very genuine concern that Judge Tjoflat

21 had was and that he -- that he articulated is it's

22 virtually impossible to get appellate review.

23 One of the things we know about habeas corpus

24 is --

25 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, we're not

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 talking about ordinary appellate review. We're talking

2 about an appeal from an adverse decision by a Federal

3 habeas court.

4 MR. RASHKIND: Correct.

5 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: So that isn't quite

6 as strange as you make it sound.

7 MR. RASHKIND: It is for this reason, Mr. Chief

8 Justice. Before, you could file successive applications.

9 In the early days of habeas corpus, you could file

10 successive applications. And the reason given was there

11 was no appeal. And so you could go from one judge to the

12 next judge because there were no appeals. Then, of

13 course, we had appeals, and the reason for having

14 successive petitions would diminish.

15 But what has happened to the appeal in a habeas

16 corpus case is it has become so constrained that in many

17 respects it doesn't exist, and that's what happened here.

18 Here's my client who faces a situation in which he has

19 clearly been thrown out of court improperly, and he goes

20 to the court of appeals to have that decision reviewed and

21 can't get past the gateway of the certificate of

22 appealability. And so he has no opportunity to really

23 have an appellate review. He has none.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, but maybe that's

25 what Congress wanted.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. RASHKIND: I don't think Congress did intend

2 that. When we looked --

3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But why isn't that always the

4 case if it's time-barred?

5 MR. RASHKIND: If it is time --

6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: If it's time-barred, you

7 never have your chance to have the merits argued.

8 MR. RASHKIND: Well, that's one of the ways in

9 which a case could be dismissed procedurally, but it's not

10 time-barred if the court rules it was erroneously. And

11 that's the concern that I think my client has here.

12 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But at what point do we bring

13 this all to a halt? I mean, there's always one more argument

14 to make that the last court to rule against me was wrong.

15 MR. RASHKIND: One of the nice things about rule

16 60(b) is it really is a disciplined approach to a court

17 examining its own mistakes. It isn't a wide-open door in

18 any respect. It is a disciplined approach. There are six

19 specific grounds, and even though the sixth one looks like

20 it's wide-open, it certainly isn't under the jurisprudence

21 of the Court.

22 And so what this does is provide a very

23 important opportunity for a judge to be able to look at an

24 intervening decision from the Supreme Court of the United

25 States and say, I have denied this person what Congress

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 wanted them to have. There's no question. One reads

2 AEDPA and one thing is very clear. They -- Congress

3 intended for a person who has exhausted claims, not

4 procedurally defaulted them in State court, and has filed

5 a timely petition, that person under 2254 is entitled to

6 have the claim entertained. And when a court makes a

7 mistake, a procedural mistake, that forgoes or eliminates

8 the opportunity for review, and that's barely reviewable on

9 appeal, depending on how the certificate of appealability

10 may be phrased -- and often these folks are pro se -- I

11 think what happens is 2254 has failed and what Congress

12 intended to happen isn't going to happen. The person was

13 entitled to one petition, one bite at the apple and never

14 receives that bite at the apple.

15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, now, the Federal

16 Government has a different proposed rule than yours. Are

17 you going to comment on their proposal?

18 MR. RASHKIND: I will. With due deference to my

19 colleagues, it's 177 words long, over two pages. And

20 that's why I thought that the approach that we brought to

21 the Court from the other nine circuits is a simpler --

22 what I would call a simple two-step.

23 Their approach actually can be read, as we did

24 in our reply brief, to fit within our own rule, but I

25 think the problem with the Government's rule is it is so

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 broad and it does not rely upon any of the Court's

2 precedents in -- in its writing. And so what you do, if

3 you adopt a rule like that, first of all, is create

4 confusion. And secondly, what you do is you make a whole

5 new set of rules that are separate and apart from what you

6 -- the Court has previously done in its AEDPA

7 jurisprudence.

8 To be able to touch upon Slack v. McDaniel, to

9 be able to draw upon Martinez-Villareal, to be able to

10 take from Rhines v. Weber, create a formula and a package

11 that's familiar to the courts, to take a rule that's 177

12 words long that the Government puts together that I

13 interpret as being favorable to my client and they

14 interpret as being unfavorable to my client, I think just

15 puts the kind of difficulty in the courts that this case

16 should try to avoid.

17 So my comment on it is that it may well, if it's

18 read as we did in our reply brief, be the same thing that

19 we're saying and what I refer to as a simple two-step

20 test. And if not, it's just going to be a source of great

21 confusion.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the -- you -- you

23 said 60(b) fits this like a glove because it's the

24 district court correcting its own errors. But it isn't

25 usually -- 60(b) was framed with the idea of the district

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 court being the very first instance court. And here you

2 will have the district court as the third going up the

3 ladder. So -- and -- and given that the habeas rules say

4 that -- that civil rules are applicable but have to be

5 modified to be compatible with habeas jurisdiction.

6 MR. RASHKIND: I think it's very important to

7 realize that both rule 81 of the Federal Rules of Civil

8 Procedure and rule 11 of the rules of habeas procedure,

9 which the State would have us use as a constraint, really

10 are the first things that tell us that there's supposed to

11 be a functional approach. Both of those rules tell us

12 that the rules apply to the extent that they're

13 compatible, and so that's certainly not a categorical

14 approach. That is a functional approach.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the Government, by

16 the way, seems a broader rule than yours. The only thing

17 it rules out is new legal claims or new evidence. I don't

18 see anything in your -- tell me if I'm wrong, but I don't

19 see anywhere where you say we should be able to bring a

20 60(b) motion based on new legal claims or new evidence.

21 MR. RASHKIND: New legal -- this is the part

22 that I think we have to look both at 60(b) and the

23 statute. New claims -- new claims -- are brought under

24 2244(b)(2). Same claims are either going to be barred by

25 (b)(1) or, if heard at all, under 60(b).

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I said. I don't

2 see how the Government hurts you. I think -- I think if

3 you the Government's, you're even better off.

4 MR. RASHKIND: Well, I think that they're --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it's even -- but I want

6 to know why -- why -- there's some reason you don't like

7 the Government, and -- and -- other than fact that they

8 must hurt you in some way. I don't see how it hurts you.

9 MR. RASHKIND: Well, I don't think it does, but

10 they do. So that troubles me.

11 (Laughter.)

12 JUSTICE BREYER: -- make us --

13 MR. RASHKIND: They make an argument that under

14 their test, my client should not prevail. I can make an

15 argument under our test my client prevails.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: And under their test too, you

17 say it's applying the same rule of -- it's not a new

18 claim. It's the same claim as -- as -- just that they --

19 shows that the district judge got it wrong.

20 MR. RASHKIND: I think the heart of the

21 Government's position is it requires a much more radical

22 departure from general procedure than a simple change of

23 law. But I don't think it's a simple change of law, for

24 example, when it is an intervening decision that

25 interprets a statute that was in effect and that the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 mistake of not interpreting correctly is to effectively

2 bar the first bite at the habeas apple.

3 Now, the Government does not give that ground in

4 their test, and I think it's important that the Court

5 leave that door open. And that's why I think our test is

6 better and theirs in inadequate.

7 I think ultimately we come down to three issues

8 that support the position that we're taking. Chief Judge

9 Edmonson made note of this in his concurring and

10 dissenting opinion. He was troubled that we were not

11 giving effect to both laws that Congress had approved,

12 60(b) and AEDPA. By virtue of the majority rule, 60(b)

13 had been categorically eliminated. And I think the

14 position we take before the Court today is that the Court

15 should honor both provisions that Congress has adopted.

16 May I reserve the balance of my time?

17 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr.

18 Rashkind.

19 MR. RASHKIND: Thank you.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Kise, we'll hear

21 from you.

22 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER M. KISE

23 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

24 MR. KISE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

25 it please the Court:

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 This case presents a fundamental inconsistency

2 to this Court. Congress said through AEDPA that a habeas

3 petitioner is to take all their claims, put them in one

4 basket, bring them to court within 1 year, and a sovereign

5 State is going to defend that judgment in Federal court

6 one time. Rule 60(b) says, petitioner, use as many

7 baskets as you need, take as long as you like, and the

8 State, you're going to have to keep coming back over and

9 over and over again.

10 And this case here presents that -- that very

11 problem.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that an exaggeration of

13 how 60(b) works in practice? It isn't that every civil

14 judgment can come back and back again with 60(b) motions.

15 The district courts have been rather disciplined in

16 handling 60(b) motions. So I think you have exaggerated

17 what 60(b) does in the ordinary civil rules context.

18 MR. KISE: Well, respectfully, Justice Ginsburg,

19 I -- I would disagree with that in this sense. I would

20 disagree with it in the sense that as Justice O'Connor

21 pointed out, if this Court were to open that door, I think

22 you would see that sort of abuse. I think you would see

23 that sort of manipulation of the process. I think you

24 would see that sort of --

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: But have we seen it in the --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there are other circuits who do adopt that rule, aren't

2 there? And have we seen the abuse you're describing?

3 MR. KISE: We have not yet, but I would submit

4 to Your Honor that that is because there is still this

5 uncertainty because this case is here before this Court,

6 and -- and because this has not yet been approved. If

7 this is approved by this Court, then you're going to see

8 sovereign States like Florida dragged back in here nearly

9 25 years later --

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that depends --

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I had the same comment

12 or the same reaction as Justice Ginsburg. Forget about

13 the habeas area. Just in -- with general civil judgments,

14 have there been Law Review articles saying that rule 60(b)

15 undermines finality? People kept going back, back, and

16 back. I -- I thought quite the opposite, that we were

17 living very well with rule 60(b).

18 MR. KISE: Well, in -- in the ordinary civil

19 context, that's perhaps correct, Your Honor, but -- but

20 this isn't the ordinary civil context. This is the habeas

21 context. And Congress has said that this is the structure

22 that we want to take. This is the rule that we want to

23 take. And as this Court has recognized that -- that AEDPA

24 was passed with -- with this enduring respect for

25 finality, this respect for the sovereignty of States.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 State, you're only going to have to come back here one

2 time. You're only supposed to litigate one time, one --

3 all the claims in one basket. They're brought within 1

4 year, and the State is to defend its judgment one time

5 because --

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But his -- his whole

7 argument is you, State, get exactly what you're entitled

8 to if I win on 60(b) because what I was entitled to and

9 what you were entitled to was the 1-year statute but

10 subject to the rule in Artuz. That's all you get, State.

11 And what he is saying is, I want to get back into court so

12 that I can have the statute of limitations -- the benefit

13 of the statute of limitations as Artuz construed it. That

14 means you, State, get what you want and I get my one

15 chance. How is that an open door to the abuse that you're

16 talking about?

17 MR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, again, there --

18 there has to be some finality to the process, and -- and

19 here what the petitioner got was at the time a

20 perceptively correct view of the law.

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: He got what Artuz said was an

22 erroneous view of the statute of limitations.

23 MR. KISE: 2 years after the district judge made

24 his ruling in this particular case. And it -- it was in

25 this particular case 2 years. It could be 10 years. It

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 could be 15 years, and that's the problem that we see is

2 that if --

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: And do you -- do you think that

4 there is -- that there is this -- this sort of tidal wave

5 of -- of erroneous statute of limitations determinations

6 that, if Artuz is applied, will suddenly be coming 5, 10,

7 and 20 years into Federal court? I mean, it -- it -- your

8 argument, in relation to his particular claim seems

9 exaggerated.

10 MR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, it's not

11 exaggerated when you look at it from the standpoint that

12 -- that Congress intended us to be in court one time to

13 defend this judgment in Federal court. We were there. He

14 received a --

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you were there for the

16 purpose of getting him booted out. I mean, you didn't --

17 you didn't get into the merits of anything.

18 MR. KISE: Well, he received a -- a final

19 disposition on the non-technical procedural basis which

20 was the applicable law at the time. He received that

21 adjudication and --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it was not the

23 applicable law at the time. The decision related back to

24 before that hearing.

25 MR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, then that would,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 respectfully, eviscerate any -- any notion of -- of the

2 statute of limitations --

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. Sometimes there are law-

4 changing decisions, but this was not a law-changing

5 decision. It's a decision interpreting what the law was

6 from the date of its enactment.

7 MR. KISE: But based on that, Your Honor, then

8 there would be no statute of limitations. If -- if that

9 decision came out 10 years from now, we would then be back

10 in this Court on a 60(b) motion, which I would submit is

11 fundamentally inconsistent with what Congress intended.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: If there had been an Artuz

13 violation and not every statute of limitations

14 determination implicates Artuz.

15 MR. KISE: That's correct, Your Honor. But at

16 the same time, there may be some other mistake or some

17 other excusable neglect or some other issue that comes up.

18 I mean, what Congress intended to prevent is not

19 just the successful filing of a 60(b) or the successful

20 revisiting, if you will, of the judgment. It -- it

21 intended to prevent the actual attempt itself. I mean,

22 the idea is -- is that once this judgment is adjudicated,

23 once we've had this adjudication, you are not to come

24 back. You are not to --

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what -- what Congress was

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 principally concerned with -- Congress was concerned with

2 two things. It was concerned with second and successive.

3 That's not what is before us. Congress was also concerned

4 with a 1-year statute of limitations. What is before us

5 on that point is that this guy did not get the benefit of

6 the statute of limitations that he had a right to get the

7 benefit of, that there was a flat mistake of law. So by

8 -- by recognizing his statute of limitations claim, we do

9 not open the door to second and successive litigation. We

10 open the door simply to Artuz problems on statute of

11 limitations rulings and that's a pretty narrow category it

12 seems to me.

13 MR. KISE: But I would -- I would respectfully

14 disagree with Your Honor's premise that -- that he -- he's

15 not seeking to revisit an adjudicated petition. He did --

16 he is seeking, as -- as we see it, to --

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. Sure, he does. And if

18 it's second and successive, he's going to get thrown out

19 again.

20 MR. KISE: And we would submit that it is second

21 and successive because it's seeking to revisit that

22 adjudication, an adjudication that was had on a non-

23 technical procedural basis.

24 JUSTICE BREYER: So that's the --

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: You may -- you may be right,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 but that's what district courts are there for.

2 MR. KISE: But -- but the Congress intended to

3 take that discretion away from the district courts.

4 2244(b)(1) says you will not look at it again, and

5 2244(b)(3) says, in fact, that when you do go back to

6 potentially revisit an issue, when you do go back to

7 potentially look at a second or successive, that it's not

8 even the same district judge that makes that

9 determination. As in 60(b), you go back to the same

10 judge. 2244(b)(3) says, no, a three-judge panel of a

11 circuit court of appeals must first determine whether or

12 not you even have a right to get in --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: That's also true of (b)(3).

14 MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: And not even the Eleventh

16 Circuit said (b)(3). And therefore, you want to say

17 absolute, or are we really talking about which 60(b)

18 motions escape the strictures of AEDPA?

19 MR. KISE: Well, I -- I think we're talking

20 about which 60(b)(3) motions -- or 60(b) motions do escape

21 the strictures of AEDPA.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: And you're prepared to defend

23 the -- the Eleventh Circuit.

24 MR. KISE: I -- I am , Your Honor.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: Correct, though you're alone on

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that because even the Government doesn't and nor does the

2 criminal justice.

3 But if you're prepared to defend them, I guess

4 you'd say why is it that they will allow (b)(3), fraud on

5 the court by the adverse party, to escape, but should your

6 own witness turn out to have been committing his own fraud

7 for whatever set of reasons, you can't.

8 MR. KISE: Well, I would -- I would say why

9 fraud -- to answer your question, Your Honor, why fraud --

10 let me back up first to the premise that -- that our

11 position and the Government's position are that far apart.

12 I would respectfully say that -- that we are not that far

13 apart. I do not see that much light between the

14 positions, although I know their brief leaves some room --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, under I guess the

16 Government, you can bring everything under 60(b). By the

17 way, if they do bring a motion to reopen under 60(b)

18 because of change of law, they're almost bound to lose.

19 There are hardly any cases which find that an adequate

20 ground under 60(b).

21 But they let you do anything under 60(b), I take

22 it, as long as the claims presented do not -- as long as

23 they are not trying to obtain relief on the basis of new

24 legal claims or new evidence.

25 Now, I just noticed there's another one here.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Do not support habeas relief. Maybe that's the problem.

2 MR. KISE: Perhaps I --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: You explain. I -- I thought

4 when I first read this, that this was quite broad, but I

5 may not have read it perfectly.

6 MR. KISE: Well, and I don't want to pretend to

7 speak for the United States because -- because that --

8 that might cause me to misspeak.

9 But to answer your question about why fraud is

10 different, I -- I have three bases for why fraud is

11 different and why we think that that exception is the

12 right exception.

13 One, this Court has said in the past that fraud

14 is different than other things. In the Hazel case that's

15 cited in Calderon, this Court has said that tampering with

16 the administration of justice through fraud involves more

17 than an injury to a single litigant. It is a wrong

18 against the very institutions designed to safeguard the

19 public, institutions that cannot tolerate fraud.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: So is that also true if his own

21 witness has committed the fraud?

22 MR. KISE: Well, I -- I would -- our fraud

23 exception that -- that we -- we are delineating here is

24 material, intentional conduct that subverts the process.

25 And it can't be just anyone, Your Honor.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

2 MR. KISE: It needs to be someone in a position

3 to subvert the process for -- for a purpose like the

4 Government or the court if you -- if -- a judge that's

5 been bribed in the unusual example of that, or -- or the

6 -- the subornation of perjury in the Hazel sense. Those

7 examples -- that would be fraud that I think is what this

8 Court was talking about in Hazel --

9 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What about a claim

10 that a witness perjured himself, a witness for the

11 government, during trial?

12 MR. KISE: Well, a witness for -- a -- a claim

13 that a witness for the government perjured himself during

14 the trial would certainly implicate material, intentional

15 conduct designed to subvert the process. And one of the

16 advantages to using fraud is -- is that it is a familiar

17 bright line, workable standard for district courts. And

18 with fraud, you have to plead a little bit more

19 particularly, and so you would avoid in some respects some

20 of the question marks that would come up --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: And all I'm saying is exactly

22 whatever criteria is met, that it happens to be his own

23 witness, and sometimes your own witnesses do have their

24 little games, you know, with prisoners, and so it's the

25 same thing.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KISE: Well --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Does that not count too?

3 MR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, I think that would

4 leave so much room for mischief, it would not be possible

5 to contain the potential for -- for abuse. I mean, if

6 every jailhouse snitch were -- were subject to -- to the

7 -- the 60(b) exception that we're -- we're articulating

8 here, if every -- every petitioner could simply say, well,

9 my own witness that I put up on the stand -- that -- that

10 witness perjured himself or herself, then -- then the

11 opportunity for mischief would abound, and we would be

12 back in the same position that we would be in general with

13 -- with States having to respond again.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kise, this may be

15 important. Do you agree with Mr. Rashkind that in the

16 Florida court the dismissal or the denial of relief was

17 not on the Florida statute of limitations --

18 MR. KISE: No, Your Honor. We -- we would

19 submit that it is on the statute of limitations, that --

20 that rule 3.850 provided the petitioner with 2 years

21 within which to apply, and both of his petitions were

22 dismissed on statute of limitations grounds. And I don't

23 know that that matters --

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not -- not clear

25 from --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KISE: -- to the end result here, but -- but

2 that -- that's our position.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not what the -- this

4 is -- the -- the form of dismissal in the Florida Supreme

5 Court doesn't tell us that. It just says something about

6 allegations contained therein do not constitute legal

7 grounds for granting the new trial.

8 MR. KISE: Your Honor may be referring to the

9 second 3.850 dismissal, and that second 3.850 didn't meet

10 the requirements of the successive rule. There -- there

11 was a first --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The first one was on the

13 statute of limitations?

14 MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor, and then the second

15 one was also on the statute of limitations in addition to

16 the fact that it did not meet the requirements of -- of

17 the successive rule because it was essentially the same

18 claim raised again. He raised the same claim a second

19 time.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have that anyplace at

21 -- in the papers before us, the first -- the first

22 dismissal in the Florida -- in the Florida trial court?

23 MR. KISE: I'm not sure exactly where it is in

24 the appendix, Your Honor. Let me see. I -- I don't know

25 that we do. I know we have reference to it, but I don't

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 know that we have the actual language.

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said --

3 MR. KISE: It is -- it is in the Eleventh

4 Circuit opinion, I believe, Your Honor.

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that it was based on the

6 Florida 2-year statute of limitations.

7 MR. KISE: Yes. I believe -- when I said

8 opinion, I'm sorry. The Eleventh Circuit record, Your

9 Honor. It is in the Eleventh Circuit record, the -- the

10 decision of the Florida court. But it is not in the

11 appendix before this Court.

12 But returning again to Justice Breyer, because I

13 don't think I finished my three reasons.

14 The first was because this Court said and says

15 fraud is different.

16 The second is because there never was a first

17 review in that sense. I mean, they never obtained the

18 first review that they -- they were seeking.

19 And the third is -- is the State's finality

20 interest, which this Court has -- has recognized as -- as

21 near paramount under certain circumstances, must yield

22 where you have the presence of fraud. And -- and so

23 that's why Florida maintains that this is the correct and

24 -- and only exception. And -- and there are several

25 reasons that we maintain that this is the correct and only

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 exception.

2 The first and -- and most important, and -- and

3 as I started this presentation, is that this is the only

4 exception that preserves congressional intent.

5 The second is -- is that AEDPA and rule 60(b)

6 cannot coexist except in very narrow circumstances because

7 they address the same subject matter in fundamentally

8 different ways.

9 And the third is, as I mentioned before, because

10 the court --

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: But is it correct that they

12 address the same subject matter? Isn't 60(b) directed at

13 the integrity of the habeas proceeding, whereas AEDPA is

14 directed at the integrity of the original conviction?

15 MR. KISE: Well, I -- I would respectfully

16 disagree with Your Honor because 2244(b)(1) does deal with

17 the -- the revisiting of the Federal habeas petition. The

18 2244(b)(1) specifically applies to the revisitation of the

19 Federal habeas petition. And in -- in terms of how they

20 deal with the same subject matter in different ways, as I

21 began, AEDPA's whole purpose is to provide one basket of

22 claims within 1 year so the State has to defend one time,

23 and 60(b) allows for the potential -- and -- and I would

24 submit to you more than just the potential if this Court

25 were to approve a standard -- for -- for repetitive

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 claims, many baskets, many -- many years, and -- and many

2 times that the State has to come back.

3 And as I say, in this case the -- the principle

4 of finality is all but abolished in this case and all be

5 eviscerated simply by the fact that nearly 25 years later

6 Florida is still in this Court defending this judgment

7 that was based on a guilty plea, not even a -- a

8 conviction. And -- and as this Court recognized, albeit

9 not as part of the holding, but -- but mentioned in -- in

10 Calderon with respect to the enduring respect for

11 finality, this is something that has survived both direct

12 and post-conviction review in the State court system.

13 I mean, this is -- this is Federal review of a

14 sovereign State's determination as to the application of

15 its criminal laws, and Congress has made a policy

16 determination that -- that that Federal review must be

17 limited because State -- State exercise of its -- of its

18 police power and -- and the enforcement of its judgments

19 is something that needs to be respected.

20 And Congress -- because the power to grant

21 habeas is given by written law, Congress has the power to

22 make that policy determination. And while the petitioner

23 argues that 60(b) somehow strikes a balance, I would

24 submit to this Court that Congress has already struck that

25 balance. Congress has already made that determination.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 There isn't another balance to be struck by the use of

2 60(b), but that a balance has already been struck by

3 Congress and Congress has made a determination that in

4 most circumstances finality is going to trump.

5 And this isn't a perfect system. There are

6 going to be exceptions with any bright line rule. With

7 any bright line rule that this Court has ever carved

8 out --

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't Congress rule -- rule

10 out 60(b) in -- in death cases?

11 MR. KISE: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Specifically

12 rule out 60(b) --

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, yes.

14 MR. KISE: -- in -- in capital cases.

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

16 MR. KISE: I don't know -- under the statute?

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. I may be wrong about

18 having --

19 MR. KISE: I'm not certain. We -- we're

20 submitting that the Congress under -- under AEDPA ruled

21 out 60(b) in all cases with the exception of -- of the

22 fraud.

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was a special

24 provision for capital cases.

25 MR. KISE: I don't believe so, Your Honor.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 But with respect to the bright line rule that --

2 that we submit is necessary to effectuate congressional

3 intent, as I was saying, that it's not a perfect system.

4 And the petitioner can come up with all manner of examples

5 that -- that seem to implicate various policy

6 determinations about what should or should not happen in a

7 given situation.

8 But -- but our position -- and we believe the

9 position of the Eleventh Circuit is -- is that Congress

10 has already weighed that now. Congress has already made

11 that determination. Congress has already told us where

12 the line is going to be drawn and it's going to be drawn

13 on the side of finality and it's going to be drawn on the

14 side of respect for State sovereignty.

15 And I would -- would also submit that -- that

16 the Sixth Circuit test and the functional equivalent

17 approach test that's advanced by the petitioner ignores

18 really both the statute and it ignores reality. It

19 ignores the statute because AEDPA tells us you can't

20 revisit an adjudicated habeas petition unless there are

21 certain limited circumstances that are met. And it

22 ignores reality because the only reason to revisit a

23 habeas petition is to ultimately revisit the underlying

24 State court judgment. And the only purpose for being

25 there is to ultimately get at that State court conviction

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that is -- that is under siege.

2 With respect to the coexistence, the petitioner

3 made a point about this case is somehow like the Rhines

4 case that was decided recently by this Court. But in the

5 Rhines case, this Court was balancing the exhaustion

6 requirements with the statute of limitations provisions.

7 Here there's nothing to balance. Here this is just simply

8 a prohibition. Congress says you cannot revisit except in

9 these isolated, limited circumstances. And so rule 81,

10 habeas rule 11, and this Court's decision in Pitchess all

11 say that 60(b) does not trump if the habeas statute holds

12 differently.

13 And finally, the courts do need a bright line

14 that's not subject to variance, as I mentioned earlier.

15 This is a workable standard. They're familiar with fraud.

16 It's well defined in the case law. It requires more

17 particularized pleading which makes less room for

18 mischief, and it -- it gives the courts an easily

19 identifiable standard by which they can effectuate that

20 congressional policy, that congressional policy of one

21 basket of claims within 1 year and the State will come

22 into this Federal court one time to defend its sovereign

23 judgment.

24 If there are no further questions, thank you.

25 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Kise.

1 Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you.

2 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT

3 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

4 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

5 MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

6 please the Court:

7 Justice Breyer, let me assure you that our

8 position is, if not as strict, only marginally less strict

9 than the State of Florida's.

10 JUSTICE BREYER: On page 24, I read the or

11 wrong.

12 MS. MILLETT: Okay.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: It's -- you meant the things on

14 both sides of the or.

15 MS. MILLETT: It's very --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: And I was thinking the first

17 side you'd allow, the second side you wouldn't. But if

18 it's very, very strict, which now I understand it, because

19 I read the or correctly when I went back.

20 MS. MILLETT: All right. I wanted to make

21 sure --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: My question would be why.

23 MS. MILLETT: Yes. And -- and if you want a

24 shorter statement -- I mean, a brief is a brief -- a short

25 statement of what our test is, Justice Breyer, it's quite

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 simple, and that is a rule 60(b) motion that seeks to set

2 aside a denial of habeas relief on the grounds that it was

3 incorrectly decided is barred. That is the territory that

4 AEDPA occupies. That includes, Justice Souter, not just

5 determinations on the --

6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would you say that again?

7 MS. MILLETT: A rule 60(b) motion that seeks to

8 set aside a final judgment denying Federal habeas relief

9 on the grounds that it was incorrectly decided is a second

10 or successive petition under AEDPA. It can proceed only

11 under AEDPA's terms, which change not only the standards

12 for a second decision, but the decision-maker, the

13 gatekeeper.

14 Justice Souter --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that a statement of when

16 it's not available? I want to be sure I -- are you

17 stating it positively or negatively?

18 MS. MILLETT: It --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: It is not available in the

20 circumstance you described. Right?

21 MS. MILLETT: That's right. It is -- it is --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Now, would you state -- tell

23 us when it is available?

24 MS. MILLETT: Okay. The flip side of that, if I

25 can -- the -- the title of section 2244 is finality of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 determination. If you are seeking to upset a final

2 determination, you are governed by 2244 not 60(b).

3 If you are not seeking to upset a final

4 determination, let me give you the two -- the two

5 circumstances that come to mind right away.

6 One is the fraud exception recognized by the

7 court of appeals, and there could be similar errors like

8 that -- and this is what we talk about in our brief -- that

9 essentially vitiate the existence of a determination in

10 the first place. They are that profound and that

11 rudimentary. Then you are not upsetting what our system

12 recognizes to be a determination and what Congress wanted

13 you to have.

14 The other exception is essentially 60(a),

15 clerical -- you're not -- errors. You're not really

16 upsetting anything. You're actually trying to implement

17 or effectuate the actual ruling by the court of appeals.

18 The only gap -- I'm not sure it's a gap at all

19 after the argument here -- is that we don't limit it to

20 fraud. We recognize that there are some other

21 foundational, rudimentary, fundamental errors that

22 conceivably could occur. I'm not aware of them happening,

23 but something like a biased judge addressed by this Court

24 in Toomey v. Ohio.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: But now you're into -- I mean,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you can use a tone of voice. You know, it sounds very

2 strong. But I thought 60(b)(6) is weird things happen,

3 and 60(b)(1) is there are all kinds of mistakes. You

4 know, some of them can just be accidental. The lawyer was

5 hit by a trolley. And in fact, all of 60(b) is meant to

6 capture that kind of thing.

7 So it sounds like what you're saying is, sure,

8 follow 60(b), maybe not the evidentiary, maybe not the new

9 evidence part, follow it, but be sure you do so strictly.

10 Are you saying more than that?

11 MS. MILLETT: I am saying a lot more than that,

12 and that is, first of all, because the vast majority of

13 things that are covered by 60(b) do not qualify as

14 tantamount to fraud or a biased judge.

15 And -- and the second incredibly important thing

16 is that Congress changed the decision-maker. Under 60(b),

17 you have 645 individual district court judges applying the

18 historic equity power to -- to overturn final judgments.

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Where -- where do you disagree

20 with Judge Carnes?

21 MS. MILLETT: With Judge?

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: With -- with the majority of

23 -- in -- in the Eleventh Circuit.

24 MS. MILLETT: If that opinion is read -- and I

25 think fairly it has to be -- as saying only fraud and not

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 errors of similar magnitude like a biased judge or some

2 other complete breakdown so that our system doesn't

3 recognize that to be a judgment -- it's not what Congress

4 thought it was giving you -- then that would be -- I can't

5 tell you there's cases where this happens, but that -- but

6 the -- the rationale for including fraud would exclude --

7 include some other similar errors of magnitude. That's

8 our only --

9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, how do you apply it in

10 this case, the Artuz problem?

11 MS. MILLETT: In -- in this case, the Artuz

12 problem is only an argument, and I -- we're not even

13 accepting that it's accurate, but only an argument that

14 the court made a mistake of law. A mistake of law is not

15 a fundamental breakdown in our system. It does not mean

16 the court didn't act as a court. This Court reverses in

17 -- or vacates in about 75 percent of its cases. It doesn't

18 mean all the lower courts were not operating as courts as

19 we recognize them as at the same level of fraud. It's

20 routine to have mistakes of law --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose Artuz had been

22 decided and it was in the mail and the judge forgot to

23 open his advance sheets that day. And so he goes back to

24 his office, says, oh, my God. You know, I mean, a weird

25 thing like that. And of course, he says nobody has been

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 hurt yet. I'll reopen it. Okay? Is that all right?

2 MS. MILLETT: If he does it within 10 days under

3 rule --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's 10 days and a half.

5 MS. MILLETT: 10 --

6 (Laughter.)

7 MS. MILLETT: Then, Justice Breyer, the nature

8 of lines is somebody falls on the other side sometimes.

9 There's an appeal process to deal with exactly that.

10 JUSTICE BREYER: And the reason that it's

11 happened is because all the lawyers were hit by four

12 trolleys.

13 (Laughter.)

14 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, you see what I'm doing?

15 I'm simply trying to find cases that fit within the

16 language, but they're very weird and justice cries out for

17 a reopening. Now, that's what it seems to me one is

18 about. Two is about. Three doesn't really. Three you

19 agree applies. Two may not apply. Three you agree

20 applies. Four I think you probably agree applies or not

21 at all. Five doesn't apply at all, and six is anything

22 under the sun.

23 MS. MILLETT: Justice Breyer, the problem is --

24 and -- and Justice Souter, you referenced this. There

25 have been many references to this, that 60(b) is not a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 problem. It's already cabined out there. In fact, it's

2 not. It's abuse of discretion review in courts of

3 appeals.

4 We cite a case, Hamilton v. Newland, from the

5 Ninth Circuit where they used 60(b)(6). The -- the

6 petitioner filed his claims. They were clearly barred by

7 the statute of limitations, not an Artuz problem. So he

8 said, all right, I'm going back to Federal court with a

9 60(b)(6) claim. I'm actually innocent. That puts me in

10 60(b)(6). I admit actual innocence. It's -- it's a very

11 weak claim. I can't been get relief on it. But the

12 district court said, come on in. I'm going to decide your

13 claims.

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe --

15 MS. MILLETT: And the -- and the --

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- maybe the district court

17 shouldn't have done that, but whatever -- whatever was

18 wrong there, it was merely a classic application of -- of

19 review of a statute of limitations point. There -- there

20 was much else involved and maybe it was improper.

21 My question, I guess, is why do you say that the

22 -- why do you assume that the policy animating applying

23 60(b) to a gatekeeping issue like statute of limitations,

24 where there is an unusual circumstance as in Artuz, should

25 be the same policy that animates applying 60(b), let's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 say, when there is an attempt to -- to make an end run

2 around the second and successive rules?

3 The latter I think we can all understand pretty

4 readily. I mean, it's very important. You've got the --

5 the -- AEDPA if you allow that.

6 With respect to this kind of a statute of

7 limitations problem, what the guy is asking for is what he

8 was entitled to under AEDPA as a matter of timing and

9 gatekeeping. Why is the policy under 60(b) the same in

10 those two cases?

11 MS. MILLETT: Justice Souter, there's two

12 answers to that. The first is that this won't be -- it

13 will be hard to limit this to a statute of limitations

14 because the next argument is going to be procedural

15 default, and the next argument is going to be

16 misapplication of Teague's non-retroactivity principle,

17 and the next one is going to be mistake in applying

18 adequate, independent State grounds.

19 The -- a bulk -- a huge percentage of Federal

20 court decision-making in habeas cases is procedural rules

21 because Federal habeas is not a roving commission for

22 error correction. You have to -- at -- in the same breath

23 that you establish a constitutional violation, you have to

24 show it's proper for Federal courts to act. Procedural

25 default and statute of limitations are as much your job to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 show to have Federal relief as it is to show that

2 something went wrong under the Constitution. It's a --

3 there's a dual character to Federal habeas relief. So

4 this, in fact, is exactly part of the habeas -- this is

5 part of the second or successive determinations that --

6 applications that Congress wanted to bar.

7 And we have to step back and think about what

8 would happen here. What we have is the State of Florida

9 coming up 23 years after a guilty plea not because to

10 defend -- once again, it's judgment. It's conviction not

11 because of anything they did in the conduct of the trial,

12 not because the guy claims to be actually innocent, but

13 because almost 2 decades after the plea, a Federal court

14 allegedly made a mistake of law that wasn't cleared up

15 through the appellate process. That's not the point of

16 Federal habeas corpus. That's not what it's supposed to

17 be about.

18 But if we open the door, if we let the camel's

19 nose in the tent, a camel is going to come behind it, and

20 it's going to be procedural default, non-retroactivity of

21 Teague, and all of the multiple other grounds on which

22 Federal habeas decisions are made by courts.

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the Federal court make a

24 mistake of -- of law if the -- if the Florida court

25 dismissed under the Florida 2-year statute of limitations?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. MILLETT: Did -- did the Florida make a

2 mistake of what --

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, no. Did the Federal

4 court. And suppose that the --

5 MS. MILLETT: No. I guess -- I think this Court

6 is going to tell us. I think the -- the Pace v.

7 DiGuglielmo case that this Court heard -- I think it was

8 last month --

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's sub judice, before us

10 now.

11 MS. MILLETT: Right.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But do you agree with Mr.

13 Kise that the first dismissal in the Florida court, the

14 first denial was on the Florida 2-year statute of

15 limitations?

16 MS. MILLETT: My -- the order from the court, my

17 understanding, simply denied it on the grounds of legal

18 insufficiency, and it didn't give a further explanation.

19 It doesn't say what exact grounds was, but if you look to

20 what was argued by Florida, they were arguing on

21 timeliness.

22 Thank you.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.

24 Millett.

Washington, DC 20005

1 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. RASHKIND

2 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3 MR. RASHKIND: Thank you, Your Honor.

4 If I may begin by correcting what I think are

5 two inadvertent mistakes, but important ones.

6 Justice Ginsburg, in answer to your question

7 about the first State habeas, these are -- these documents

8 are contained in -- in your record. They're noted at

9 joint appendix 2-5.

10 The first State habeas was dismissed because it

11 was not notarized. That's the sole basis for its

12 dismissal: it was not notarized.

13 The second one was brought and denied, and the

14 court specifically notes, as we note in the yellow brief,

15 footnote 7 on page 12, it set forth the -- the court's

16 grounds. It says the motion does not state grounds for

17 relief.

18 At no point does Florida ever adopt the State's

19 position that either of the petitions was untimely. The

20 State court addressed them directly on the merits.

21 Justice Breyer, if I may, I can actually

22 hypothesize several examples under subsection (5), of

23 subsection (4), and perhaps even subsection (2) of rule

24 60(b), which would be permissible. For example, under

25 (5), a judgment that should no longer have continuing

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 effect might be that the district court entered an

2 alternative writ of habeas corpus, tried the defendant

3 within 60 days or 90 days, or set him free. And when

4 everyone gets back to State court, it becomes plainly

5 apparent that can't be done within 60 days, and either the

6 State or the defendant might go back and say, please,

7 amend that order out of time. It's a final order. Please

8 amend it to make it 180 days.

9 We can come up with examples, I think, for each

10 of the provisions, and I think that's really what's

11 interesting about this rule. It is written in a way

12 that's durable against AEDPA, and it conforms nicely with

13 AEDPA. And it does not take a lot of extra thought, it

14 does not take a lot more than adopting the Court's

15 previous holdings for us to be able to make it workable

16 within AEDPA.

17 The fact that this case is now in its 25th year

18 is a result of law and not of delay. Mr. Gonzalez alleges

19 -- and no one has ever been able to say otherwise because

20 we've never had a hearing -- that it took him 13 years to

21 find out about the newly discovered evidence. He

22 exhausted his claims for 4 years. He was only in Federal

23 court for 1 year before the State raised a bar, a statute

24 of limitations bar, which turns out to be incorrect. In

25 the last 7 years, there's been litigation both in the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 court of appeals and now before this Court caused by the

2 State's argument that the case should have been dismissed

3 on the statute of limitations.

4 My client is not responsible for the fact that

5 it's the 25th year, but what we do know about this case is

6 he has approximately 76 years remaining on his 99-year

7 sentence. And unless he gets one bite at the habeas

8 apple, he has not gotten what Congress directed he

9 receive. Congress made one thing clear in AEDPA, and I

10 think it's a good thing, and that is, if a defendant goes

11 through and does what he's supposed to do in State court,

12 he does not procedurally default the issues, he exhausts

13 fully, and he timely files a petition, that was the

14 candidate Congress wanted to have to get habeas review.

15 In this case Aurelio Gonzalez did all of those

16 things, and he sits on the outside, having been told you

17 get no bite at the apple, it's too late. And that's just

18 plain wrong. And there's something wrong about that, and

19 that's why there's rule 60(b).

20 60(b) is nothing but a coalescence of many great

21 writs that were designed for one purpose and one purpose

22 alone and that was to correct mistakes in extraordinary

23 circumstances. There can be no more extraordinary
