  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals held that respondents could bring this suit under the Administrative Procedure Act to challenge the Bureau of Land Management's ongoing management of vast tracts of public land in Utah divorced from any specifically identifiable agency action that BLM had taken or that BLM was obligated to take but had not. The court of appeals relied on section 706(1) of the APA which authorizes a court to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed. The court of appeals decision is contrary to the text of 706(1) which is limited to compelling agency action, not ongoing agency conduct. It is contrary to the roots of 706(1) in mandamus, which has historically been limited to the performance -- compelling the performance of what this Court termed in its seminal Kendall decision precise and definite acts. It is contrary to the APA's generally applicable limitation of judicial review to final agency action, not the sort of evaluation and planning activities at issue here."

Certainly an action can be discrete and be compellable under old mandamus rules without being final agency action in the narrow -- in the narrow sense. Let's assume a -- a requirement under -- under the statute that the agency promulgate its regulations by a certain date. Okay? Now, I -- I'm -- I'm not sure that that would constitute a failure -- the -- let's say these regulations are -- are general plans of the sort that are at issue here so that they would not give rise to any immediate right of action in that they're not final agency action. But if the statute says that the agency plan will be promulgated by a certain date, wouldn't there be a cause of action to require -- you know, 6 months after that date the agency still hasn't come out with the plan.

I -- I think it's much more useful to the Government to -- to say that -- that a lawsuit can't be brought as soon as the plan is adopted, which it could if you call that final agency action, than it is to say that the failure to promulgate it can be -- cannot be sued upon because the promulgation is not final agency action."

  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Just because something is final agency action doesn't mean it's ripe for judicial review. And that -- that's basically what this Court held in the Ohio Forestry case where it was a challenge to a comparable general land use plan that the Forest Service had promulgated. The plan itself was final agency action, but the Court said it was not ripe for judicial review because it did not have any immediate consequences on the behavior -- behavior of persons. But the court of appeals in this case allowed 706(1) to be used to compel certain conduct that is certainly not -- probably not even agency action, but certainly not final agency action, for example, monitoring. Some of these plans contemplated that -- that BLM personnel would -- would go out and monitor various activities, not surprisingly in -- in the vast tracts of land, and the court said that that could be compelled under 706(1)."

I don't find that implausible at all. I -- I don't understand the role of the courts to be to oversee executive action. You have congressional oversight committees that do that. I understood the role of the courts to be to vindicate individual rights when they have been violated. And what the Government is saying here is that no individual right has been violated until there has been final agency action. Final agency action is what confers -- it's -- it's an action that changes the law, that establishes requirements. And until that happens, there's no individual right. I'm not willing to accept your proposition that -- that the role of courts is to make sure that agencies tow the line. That's -- that's the President's role. It's not ours at all."

And it's no -- there is no argument here that the plaintiffs lacked standing under this Court's decisions to enforce this mandatory obligation of the agencies to avoid impairment. And so I think that that's the right way to think about it. And if you look at the -- the finality concept and the right role it should be playing here, it's the inaction that has to be final, not the action that you're seeking to compel. It's -- their -- their reading of the statutory text puts the word final in the wrong section. Finality comes up under section 704 which says final agency action is subject to judicial review. Agency action, in turn, is defined as including failure to act. So as the courts, since the APA has -- was first brought out, have consistently said you look at whether the inaction is sufficiently final to decide this is the right time to bring a lawsuit."

  {
    "speaker": "SMITH",
    "speech": "Well, two points, Your Honor. First of all, I don't disagree that the concept of harm is a key part of how you decide whether or not the inaction is sufficiently final to bring a lawsuit. We want to look at several things, whether the Congress imposed a deadline or a continuous duty, as they did here, whether there's irreparable harm, whether the agency is operating under a misunderstanding of the statute that is involved. The courts say in those situations, the practical concept of finality is used to decide this inaction is sufficiently serious that we're going to allow review now."

What the BLM regulations say is that when the BLM official on site finds that off-road vehicles are causing considerable adverse impacts on a list of things, including wilderness suitability, which is what we're talking about with the wilderness study areas, quote, the agency, quote, shall immediately close the areas affected to the types of vehicle causing the adverse effect until the adverse effects are eliminated and measures implemented to prevent recurrence, unquote. So the -- the rule is if there's -- if there's impairment being caused by off-road vehicles, you close it on an emergency basis and then you consider whether or not you're going to take other steps to -- to deal with it down the road when you open it up again."

Why wouldn't that be the right procedure rather than to come into court and say we want a judge to do it first in the first instance?"

This is the -- we're looking for the orange op cert, Your Honor, not the -- the joint appendix. And 52 is an example of what was done in the effort to get the BLM to act on -- in -- in accordance with its own statutory and regulatory obligations. And it says, we just wanted to point out to you there's all this irreparable harm going on. There's ORV's rampant in these wilderness areas, and as you well know -­ this is in the middle of the first paragraph -- 43 C.F.R., section 8341.2 -- that's the one I was talking about before -- directs BLM managers to immediately close areas suffering considerable adverse effects from ORV use and abuse. So we brought it to the agency's attention, and they, as -- as they have done throughout the period, simply didn't do anything."

They then come back with a thing that says, well, we don't think that ORV use is so bad after all and so we're just not going to do anything.

Circuit said, well, we have jurisdiction under that, under 706(1), but we're not going to order that because there are 16 other drugs over there that are in the same situation. They don't have the capacity to get this done, and we're not going to put them at the head of the line because they brought the lawsuit first. The courts do have a lot of power in considering things like finality and then deciding about what kind of equitable discretion to exercise -- and the D.C. Circuit case law is quite sophisticated on this subject -- to decide whether they want to enforce in the way that is being requested. All we're saying is if there's a duty under the statute or under the -- the plan, the plan isn't amended, it ought to be something that you can get into court and let the judge look at and decide whether this is an appropriate duty to enforce at this time."

It's -- it's got a very clear, specific duty and severe irreparable harm that will happen if the BLM doesn't make it a priority. In those situations, the Federal courts are much more likely to say we are going to grant some relief in this -- we are going to force the BLM, or whoever it is, to follow the statutory obligations. In many other kinds of situations, when the agency comes in and says, well, we have 66 other things like this we should be doing, the courts are much less likely to do that. We're just saying that there has to be a power in the Federal courts at some point to compel adherence to the law when all of the other requirements are set, standing, finality, a clear mandatory duty which is perhaps better defined in the regulations, as you have here, all of these things, that if you don't have the -­ the residual power in the courts to take action at some point when the violation gets sufficiently serious and harmful, then the -- the provision really isn't enforceable at all.

    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. We think that this case is really controlled by Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, which really was the mirror image of this case. It was a situation in which plaintiffs sought to challenge again conduct of BLM on a programmatic basis, saying that BLM, with respect to vast tracts of land, had not taken action that -- that the plaintiffs thought it should take. And this Court held that, no, such a suit must focus on not only agency action, discrete action, but final agency action, and you can't bring about wholesale change in an agency program under 706(2). It follows, we think, a fortiori under 706(1) that that cannot be done because 706(1) is essentially ancillary to 706(2). It is designed to require the agency to disgorge final agency action if it has a legal obligation to do it so that once that final agency action is issued, it can be reviewed under the central provision of the APA, section 706(2). 706(1) is limited to compelling that sort of action and putting the courts in the position where they can then review final agency action in the way the Administrative Procedure Act contemplates, which is on the basis of the agency's decision, the agency's finding of fact, its application of law and policy to fact and its rationale. So this is not just a matter of form. We think that the difference between the lawsuit that plaintiffs have brought and the lawsuit that the APA contemplates is critical to the relationship between agencies and courts under the APA and under the separation of powers under the Constitution. Plaintiffs' vision would put the courts in the position in the first instance of finding whether there's been compliance with the statutory standards. Our view and the way the APA requires is to submit a request for a particular order or regulation, let the agency act, and then review that discrete controversy. All three of the claims in this case that the plaintiffs have brought would reflect a radical departure from that view. The first is to compel compliance with a general statutory standard to manage lands in a particular way. Management is not agency action. It's like a program, which this Court said in Lujan could not be reviewed. The claim to require NEPA statements is independent, not tied to any proposed major Federal action. They're claiming an ongoing duty to update NEPA programs. And with respect to the land management program -- plans, no court has ever held since FLPMA was enacted and these plans have been utilized that they impose on BLM a duty owed to members of the public to comply with schedules, tentative, anticipated schedules, as this document says, of what will be carried out in the future. This is not just a question of standing and zone of interest which private people might be able to sue. It's more fundamental than that. These plans do not impose any duties owed to any member of the public because they are designed for internal management by the agency. We are in no way saying that what BLM does is beyond judicial review, but the plaintiffs are required to follow the right procedures."

And SUWA never challenged that. Justice O'Connor, you referred to pictures in the -- in the joint appendix.
