But at the time, ex ante, no company, when it gets an adverse event report, can possibly know whether that's enough information for the FDA to act. So the prospect that the FDA may some day act on the basis of additionally accumulated information would require disclosure of all reports all the time, and that, we submit, cannot be the standard."

But the question is, again, ex ante, before you know what the FDA might do, before there's sufficient evidence to justify the FDA to act. Remember, the FDA didn't act for 5 years. The FDA didn't act on the basis of what Matrixx was aware of at the time, and so that can't be the standard, the idea that the FDA may some day act. Statistical significance -- the question of statistical significance is presented in this case to the extent the courts below were arguing about and the plaintiffs were arguing about whether or not the small number of raw adverse event reports tell you anything meaningful. The real standard -- the -- the case got developed in the briefing here when the plaintiffs came back and said, well, there's more to it and there can be more to it, and that, of course, is true, but the standard has to be reliability."

In Tellabs, the Court said that whether or fact the other side has litigated this case on the basis that no one would have thought within the company, based on the adverse event reports, that there was a basis for thinking there was information. We plead the other way by saying that when you have three medical specialists in three distinct periods where the last wants to bring findings to the leading ear, nose, and throat medical society suggesting that, based on studies that go back as far back as the 1930s, there is a scientifically plausible link based on the zinc ions, that's something that the company should have taken seriously and disclosed to investors."

So, I do think that, to the extent there is any was it not only articulated the general standard, but it laid out some factors. And in laying out those factors, that's where the Court deferred to the SEC's brief. And it laid out factors that a reasonable investor might find relevant. In that case, it was the merger context.

    "speech": "Sure. Two responses to that. One, the PSLRA does have a safe harbor for companies once they make forward-looking statements, that if they add in meaningful cautionary language -- and this is in the PSLRA itself, section 5(c)(1)(A) -- that if they add that no reasonable investor would care if it tanked, then that might be a circumstance where a motion to dismiss would be appropriate. Thank you, Your Honor."

    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to return to Justice Kennedy's question about the role of scienter here, which I think absolutely is critical, as this Court emphasized recently in the Merck v. Reynolds case. Mr. Frederick correctly, I think, conceded that there has to be a scientifically plausible basis. And what you're talking about here is a company's knowledge of a scientifically plausible basis. And he has to make that concession in this case because of what's alleged to be the material omission. The material omission is not knowledge of so there has to be a basis for believing that -- there has to be allegation in the complaint that's sufficient to establish that Matrixx actually knew that Zicam causes anosmia and yet willfully refused to tell investors that fact. And there's nothing in the complaint like that. There's not -- you're not talking about a case where there was a failure to disclose the doctor's completely dubious untested claim. It's not a case -­ it's not the Satan case where you're talking about a media splash, a known fact that there's going to be a major media splash, and the company knows for a fact that that splash is going to have the adverse effect on the stock. There's not even a claim here -­"

    "speech": "Well, two points, Your Honor. First, if the claim was about, you know, the consumer sales, you would need an allegation in the case that consumer product sales were actually affected. There's no allegation like that, and the truth is they weren't. And so you're not talking about falsifying any prior claim. There's not even an allegation that that happened, Your Honor. And, second, with respect to the -- the statement, as I was discussing with Justice Ginsburg in the beginning part of the argument, the statement was -­ what the scientific panel was addressing primarily was Jafek's claim that Zicam causes anosmia, and the company said accurately that that is completely unfounded and misleading because there's no scientific support for it. You can't go out and claim that Zicam causes anosmia unless you have a scientific basis for that. And the scientific panel was saying that isn't true. So the question is whether you can draw an inference of scienter from the fact that -- from what's Counsel. The case is submitted."
