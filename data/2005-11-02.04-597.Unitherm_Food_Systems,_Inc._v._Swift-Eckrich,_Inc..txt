3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

4 first today in Unitherm Food Systems versus Swift-Eckrich.

5 Mr. Bailey.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BURCK BAILEY

7 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8 MR. BAILEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10 In 1947, this Court stated, in Cone versus West

11 Virginia Pulp & Paper Company, 330 U.S. at 216, quote,

12 "Determination of whether a new trial should be granted,

13 or a judgment entered under Rule 50(b), calls for the

14 judgment in the first instance of the judge who saw and

15 heard the witnesses and has the feel of the case, which no

16 appellate printed transcript can impart." That language

17 was repeated verbatim the following year in Globe Liquor

18 versus San Roman. And, in the year after that, both Cone

19 and Globe Liquor were cited for the same proposition in

20 Fountain versus Filson. And, in 1952, in Johnson versus

21 New York Railway, this Court again reiterated the

22 requirement -- is the word the Court used -- of submitting

23 a post-verdict motion, or JNOV, to preserve sufficiency of

24 the evidence for appellate review.

25 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, was there a Rule 59

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 motion made here after the verdict?

2 MR. BAILEY: No, Your Honor. There was a motion

3 for a remittitur --

4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right.

5 MR. WOLFMAN: -- of damages.

6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Had a Rule 59 motion been

7 made, would it preserve a sufficiency-of-the-evidence

8 argument in connection with the motion for new trial?

9 MR. BAILEY: Not a sufficiency-of-the-evidence

10 argument, Your Honor. And that -- this Court spoke to

11 that in footnote 9 of the Weisgram opinion. But a Rule 59

12 motion contesting the weight of the evidence would have

13 been appropriate. No such motion was filed.

14 Eight of the Circuit Courts of Appeals have held

15 that in the absence of a post-verdict Rule 50(b) motion,

16 the appellate court cannot review for sufficiency of the

17 evidence. And that language is in black letter law in the

18 standard treatises on Federal practice, in Moore's and in

19 Wright & Miller, that it is absolutely required. Here --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do any of those circuits allow

21 an exception for plain error?

22 MR. BAILEY: Several of them do --

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

24 MR. BAILEY: -- Your Honor. Some do not, but

25 most, I think it would be accurate to say, do. And, Your

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Honor, we feel that those cases are mistakenly decided,

2 because the court's ruling on a 50(a) motion -- that is, a

3 pre-verdict motion -- is always interlocutory. I mean,

4 indeed, the trial court is encouraged to deny that motion,

5 pending the jury verdict, because if the jury comes back,

6 obviously, with a defendant's verdict, that's the end of

7 the case. And if the Court, on the other hand, grants

8 it, and the appellate court concludes that there was a

9 jury question, then it has to go back for a whole new

10 trial. So --

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just while I have you, I'm --

12 just while I have you here -- it's not --

13 MR. BAILEY: Yes.

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- probably, directly relevant

15 to this case. On that one point, when I was in practice,

16 it used to irritate me sometimes that the judge should

17 grant the motion and then he'd just sit on it. But I see

18 the wisdom for the rule now, and the judge reserving it,

19 in the event the jury comes out the right -- the, quote,

20 "right way," anyway. What if there's a very long trial?

21 What if, after the plaintiff rests, there's a good grounds

22 for granting the motion for judgment as a matter of law,

23 the judge doesn't do it, and then there's a 3-month trial?

24 Do the judges ever take that into account?

25 MR. BAILEY: Your --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Three more months for the

2 defense to --

3 MR. BAILEY: Yes. Your Honor, I think my answer

4 to that is, not infrequently holes in the plaintiff's case

5 are filled when the defendant's case is put on. That

6 happens, as I say, rather frequently, through cross-

7 examination and -- and it's just extremely iffy to say

8 that won't occur. And, in any event, Your Honor, it

9 raises the specter of this problem that we've just talked

10 about, that that long trial that you -- that you

11 envisioned in your hypothetical would have to -- if the

12 appellate court finds that there is a jury question there

13 --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

15 MR. BAILEY: -- has to try it all over again.

16 Not a -- not a very good consequence.

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: On the issue that's before us

18 now, I can understand why, if the, what we used to call,

19 JNOV is not requested after the jury verdict, the

20 appellate court could not then enter judgment -- direct

21 the entry of judgment as a matter of law. But I don't see

22 why it couldn't say, just as we would be reluctant to

23 affirm a decision when there was no claim for relief, so,

24 if there's insufficient evidence, we can remand for a new

25 trial. But you would say that that is not possible

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 either.

2 MR. BAILEY: I would, Your Honor. That's not

3 authorized. There's no way to ask for a new trial in a

4 50(a) motion. I mean, it doesn't provide for that. The

5 trial is still going on. By definition, you can't seek a

6 new trial until the trial is --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But --

8 MR. BAILEY: -- concluded.

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you haven't asked for it,

10 but the appellate court said, "We don't want to affirm a

11 judgment when there was insufficient evidence, so we are

12 going to" -- there was -- the judge was tipped off by the

13 -- by the directed-verdict motion, that the -- who turned

14 out to be -- the one who turned out to be the verdict

15 loser thinks the evidence is insufficient. That's enough

16 at least to say that the Court of Appeals could grant a

17 new trial.

18 MR. BAILEY: Your Honor, it's our position that

19 you can never ask for -- move for a new trial for -- on

20 the ground that the evidence is against -- the weight --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I'm not --

22 MR. BAILEY: -- of the evidence --

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- talking about "against the

24 weight," because a trial judge would rarely be -- if it --

25 if a trial judge said, "It's against the weight of the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 evidence," it would go back for a new trial, and you

2 couldn't raise that issue, at least not til you go through

3 the whole second trial. But why isn't it like -- I think

4 there are decisions that say there was a judgment, but

5 the Court of Appeals determines there was never a claim

6 for relief to begin with, even though a motion wasn't made

7 to that effect. The idea of a court affirming a judgment

8 that is without sufficient legal basis is troubling.

9 MR. BAILEY: Well, Your Honor, I -- my response

10 to that is that these matters, pursuant to this Court's

11 jurisprudence in Cone and Johnson and other cases, simply

12 mandates that the trial court be asked to pass in the

13 first instance on this issue of sufficiency of the

14 evidence.

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, it -- but it was asked

16 by the -- by the pre-verdict motion. What -- the only

17 thing that wasn't done is, it -- the request wasn't

18 repeated after the verdict. I can see your point if there

19 had never been a motion for directed verdict at the close

20 of all of the evidence. But there was that. And so, all

21 that we're missing is a repetition of the same words after

22 the jury comes in.

23 MR. BAILEY: Well, Your Honor, the -- if I may,

24 the standard of review is radically different. I mean, if

25 motion for a JNOV is asked for and granted/denied, the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 review is de novo. The issue about a new trial, under 59,

2 is an abuse of discretion.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's -- the new trial

4 comes in, by the courts that have said this, only --

5 they'd say, "We would direct the entry of judgment for the

6 verdict loser, but we're powerless to do that." And that

7 is all wrapped up in the Seventh Amendment. So, the next

8 best thing is, we grant a new trial.

9 MR. BAILEY: Well, that's certainly what the

10 Tenth Circuit jurisprudence provides, Your Honor. And the

11 Federal Circuit adopted that.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

13 MR. BAILEY: And we think that that's totally at

14 odds with this Court's rule in Cone and Johnson, that it

15 is out of step with the law in eight Federal Circuits,

16 that it simply is illogical to say, someone who never

17 asked for a new trial -- Your Honor, if they had -- if

18 ConAgra had sought a new trial on sufficiency of the

19 evidence in Federal Circuit, presumably, the Federal

20 Circuit said, "You didn't ask for that below. It's gone.

21 It's waived. What's your next argument?" By not asking,

22 they say, in effect, "Since you didn't ask for it, that's

23 what we're going to give you." And that simply is, Your

24 Honor --

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, couldn't one regard a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 new trial as, sort of, subsumed under the request for

2 judgment as a matter of law? That is, that's the larger

3 thing, but at least a new trial. Don't let -- the

4 judgment as a matter of law says, "Don't let this verdict

5 stand." So, one could say, "We won't give you a judgment,

6 but we will order a new trial."

7 MR. BAILEY: And, Your Honor, I -- my response

8 is simply that those are two very different motions and

9 call for two very different standards of review, and it

10 cannot, I respectfully submit, logically be administered,

11 when there's been no request for a new trial. There's no

12 authority to request a new trial in a 50(a) motion. It

13 leads to the kind of confusion that, I submit --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you refresh my

15 recollection? In the cases you cited at the outset of

16 your argument, where the judgments were reversed, am I

17 wrong in thinking, in those cases, there was, in fact, a

18 new trial afterwards?

19 MR. BAILEY: There -- Your Honor, they had moved

20 for a new trial in those cases. That is, the defendant

21 moved for a new trial. And that -- and this Court --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the judgment of this Court

23 was simply reverse, wasn't it?

24 MR. BAILEY: It was reverse.

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: There were --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BAILEY: Of the appellate court -
-

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.


3 MR. WOLFMAN: -- of the Eighth Circuit. Yes, 


4 Your Honor, that's right. It was -- this Court simply

5 reversed, in Cone and Johnson. Those cases went back for

6 retrial. Yes.

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't understand your

8 response to me about vastly different standards of review.

9 I would think it would be harder for a verdict loser to

10 get judgment as a matter of law than to get a new trial.

11 MR. BAILEY: At the trial or the appellate

12 level, either one --

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

14 MR. BAILEY: -- Your Honor? Yes. Well, one

15 would -- I quite agree.

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's why --

17 MR. BAILEY: But --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I'm suggesting --

19 MR. BAILEY: -- but the --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that one is kind of a

21 lesser included.

22 MR. BAILEY: Yes, Your Honor. And the response

23 I have to make is that the reviewing court would determine

24 the issue of new trial on an abuse-of-discretion standard,

25 not on a de novo review of sufficiency of the evidence.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They go to different

2 things, don't they? I mean, if you -- you get a new trial

3 when there are -- you know, evidence is admitted that

4 shouldn't have been admitted, or something like that. I

5 mean, they're -- they're, sort of, different grounds.

6 They're not overlapping, are they?

7 MR. BAILEY: They -- very different grounds most

8 -- most commonly, Your Honor. That is, you can -- there

9 can be completely sufficient evidence to support the jury

10 winner's verdict --

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --

12 MR. BAILEY: -- but the Court can still --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- this is a --

14 MR. BAILEY: -- grant a new trial.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. I meant -- I'm

16 not sure. I mean, is it a -- is insufficient evidence a

17 typical ground for asking for a new trial?

18 MR. BAILEY: Well, not insufficient evidence,

19 but the --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No.

21 MR. BAILEY: -- the verdict is against the

22 weight of the evidence. That is the distinction that this

23 Court pointed out in footnote 9 of Weisgram, that if

24 you're talking about the weight of the evidence -- the

25 verdict is against the weight of the evidence; very

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 subjective proposition, but that it is -- then you proceed

2 under Rule 59.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that determination of what

4 was the weight of the evidence is typically left to the

5 trial judge, rather than to the Court of Appeals. It

6 would be --

7 MR. BAILEY: Well, you can --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- somewhat novel for the Court

9 of Appeals to be reviewing a trial judge on the basis of

10 what it thought the weight of the evidence was. It's one

11 thing to say, "If he's denied or granted a motion for a

12 new trial on that basis, we'll look for abuse of

13 discretion," but for the appellate court to do that de

14 novo and assess the weight of the evidence, it seems, to

15 me, quite unusual.

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's --

17 MR. BAILEY: I --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't think any appellate

19 court has claimed that authority. We're talking about a

20 new trial in lieu of J- -- a judgment as a matter of law.

21 And the -- one of the whole rationales in Cone and Globe

22 and all of the others were saying you should make the

23 post-verdict motion -- is that then the trial judge would

24 have the option. The trial judge might think, "Well,

25 technically, you deserve JMOL, but maybe there was a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 witness who was out to sea, so I want to exercise my

2 discretion to grant a new trial." Those two are closely

3 linked. I mean, lawyers usually, as a -- just a matter of

4 -- just automatically ask for JNOV or, in the alternative,

5 a new trial.

6 MR. BAILEY: Your Honor, I think it shows

7 respect to the trial judge to require that the trial judge

8 be required, in the first instance, to review this

9 evidence that the trial judge saw, heard, and has the same

10 opportunity, as this Court has observed in cases going

11 back over a century, to see, just like the jurors saw, and

12 provides a perspective on it that is available to the

13 trial judge, alone.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --

15 MR. BAILEY: Your Honors, if --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it seems --

17 MR. BAILEY: -- I may, I'd --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it seems to me that if the

19 Court of Appeals is going to grant a new trial, it must

20 say one of two things. It must say either, number one,

21 "There was not sufficient evidence to go to the jury, but

22 the conclusion of that determination ought to be -- and,

23 therefore, you know, the case is over"; but to say that

24 and then say, "And, therefore, we give a new trial," it

25 seems very strange. Or else, the Court of Appeals has to

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 say, you know, "The weight of the evidence was not in the

2 plaintiff's favor." And if it says that, it's making the

3 kind of a determination that I find unusual for a Court of

4 Appeals.

5 MR. BAILEY: Yes, Your Honor. But circumventing

6 the application to the trial judge --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But --

8 MR. BAILEY: -- in the first instance --

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- in fact, that's not what

10 the Courts of Appeals have said. They have all said, "We

11 would grant judgment as a matter of law, but we're

12 powerless to do that under this case -- Court's case law.

13 We think the evidence is insufficient, not that it's

14 against the weight of the evidence. We think it's

15 insufficient. If we had the power to do it, we would

16 direct the entry of judgment. We can't do that, so we do

17 the next best thing."

18 But in all of the -- including the Tenth

19 Circuit, whose law is relevant here -- the Court of

20 Appeals is saying, "We think the judgment -- there was

21 insufficient evidence to support that judgment. And if we

22 had the power, we would instruct the entry of judgment.

23 We don't have that power."

24 MR. BAILEY: That's exactly what they said, Your

25 Honor. And we say they had no authority to do that. In

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the absence of taking it in the first instance before the

2 trial court. May I reserve --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose they could make the

4 same -- if -- I mean, if that follows, they should be able

5 to do the same thing when there has been no motion made,

6 neither before nor after, right? They could say, "Well,

7 there's no motion made. We really have no authority to

8 reverse this judgment."

9 MR. BAILEY: That's --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: "But" --

11 MR. BAILEY: -- that's certainly --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you know, "we certainly

13 think there was not enough evidence, and, therefore, we

14 grant a new trial." Does any court do that?

15 MR. BAILEY: I may have missed, Your Honor --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where no motion has been made

17 --

18 MR. BAILEY: Yes.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- neither before the verdict

20 nor after the verdict, does any appellate court say,

21 "Since no motion was made, we have -- we have no power to

22 reverse the judgment here, but our examination of the case

23 indicates that there was really not sufficient evidence to

24 go to the jury. And, therefore, we will do the lesser

25 thing and grant a new trial"? Does any court of --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 appellate court do that?

2 MR. BAILEY: Your Honor, I know of no case where

3 an appellate court would do such a thing when there's no

4 motion of any kind that's ever been made contesting the --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the trial court could

6 do that, pursuant to Rule 59(d), couldn't it?

7 MR. BAILEY: I'm sorry.

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: I say, the trial court could

9 have done that pursuant to Rule 59(d) without a motion

10 being filed.

11 MR. BAILEY: I quite agree, Your Honor. Yes.

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you --

13 MR. BAILEY: May I reserve the rest of my time?

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Bailey.

15 Mr. Stewart.

16 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

17 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

18 IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER

19 MR. STEWART: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

20 may it please the Court:

21 It's a well established principle of Federal

22 appellate practice that the litigant must adequately

23 preserve a claim in the trial court in order to raise it

24 on appeal. The disputed issue in this case is whether a

25 claim of insufficient evidence is adequately preserved for

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 appeal through the filing of a pre-verdict Rule 50(a)

2 motion or whether a renewed post-verdict motion under Rule

3 50(b) must be filed, as well. The text of Rule 50, the

4 practical considerations that underlie contemporaneous

5 objection rules, and this Court's decisions construing

6 Rule 50 all indicate that a post-verdict motion is

7 necessary for adequate preservation of the claim.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think it may be --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the usual practice with

10 regard to the pre-verdict motions? Are -- is the initial

11 one made at the close of the plaintiff's case --

12 MR. STEWART: It often is. It can be made --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and then renewed at the --

14 at the end of all of the evidence?

15 MR. STEWART: I think that's a very typical

16 practice.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

18 MR. STEWART: It doesn't -- it doesn't have to

19 be made at the close of the plaintiff case, but it can be

20 made at any time after the opposing party has had an

21 adequate opportunity to be heard. And so --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they're really different

23 things to be reviewed at those two times. I mean, at the

24 end of all the evidence, there may be some matter that the

25 defendant inadvertently puts in that makes up the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 deficiency in the plaintiff's case. So, it's really a

2 different motion, isn't it?

3 MR. STEWART: It is requesting the same sort of

4 --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of relief.

6 MR. STEWART: -- relief, but it -- different

7 considerations would affect the trial judge's decision

8 whether to grant the motion. And I think -- in a sense,

9 this goes to Justice Kennedy's question -- that is, one of

10 the reasons that, at least with respect to the motion

11 that's filed at the conclusion of all the evidence, that

12 these motions are almost uniformly not granted, the case

13 is almost always submitted to the jury, because the

14 thought is, very little is lost by submitting the case to

15 the jury, because the suit has been tried already, and

16 there may be substantial gains in efficiency from pursuing

17 that course. I think if a motion was made at the

18 conclusion of the plaintiff's case, and the judge thought

19 it clearly had merit and thought that a substantial

20 savings in cost and time would ensue from granting the

21 motion, the trial judge could take that into account in

22 deciding whether the motion should be granted or not. But

23 I think -- I think it's important to look at the text of

24 Rule 50. And it's reprinted, among other places, at page

25 57(a) of the appendix to the certiorari petition. And in

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- at the beginning of Rule 50(a)(1), it says, "If, during

2 a trial by jury, a party has been fully heard on an issue

3 and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a

4 reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the

5 Court may determine the issue against that party." Again,

6 the word "may" is permissive.

7 So, while the judge may take into account

8 potential savings in time and expense, the judge is never

9 required to grant a Rule 50(a) motion, even if the judge

10 is firmly persuaded that the evidence on the other side is

11 insufficient.

12 And then, at the very bottom of the page, the

13 first sentence of Rule 50(b) says, "If, for any reason,

14 the Court does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter

15 of law made at the close of all the evidence, the Court is

16 considered to have submitted the action to the jury,

17 subject to the Court's later deciding the legal questions

18 raised by the motion."

19 And the significance of that sentence is that it

20 says, "No matter what stated rationale the District Court

21 gives" -- whether the District Court simply says, "I'm

22 reserving the motion," or says, "I'm denying it, because

23 the evidence is, in my view, clearly sufficient" --

24 "whatever stated rationale the Court gives, the action

25 will be treated as a reservation of the legal questions."

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And I think one of the reasons that it would be

2 inappropriate to allow appeal of a sufficiency claim

3 without a renewed post-verdict motion is that in order to

4 attain reversal on appeal, regardless of whether the

5 remedy is entry of judgment or a new trial, the Court of

6 Appeals has to be able to point to an erroneous ruling by

7 the District Court. And the reservation of a ruling on

8 the 50(a) motion, by its nature, can't be erroneous. That

9 is, the judge is specifically authorized to submit the

10 case to the jury --

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Stewart, just let me

12 clear up one thing of confusion. Is it not true that if

13 the District judge denies the motion before submitting the

14 case to the jury, within 10 days after the jury verdict,

15 if no further motion is made, he would still -- the judge

16 would still have authority to change his mind and grant

17 the motion?

18 MR. STEWART: We don't believe that that's the

19 case. That is, at this point, the rule has been amended

20 so that the time for filing a post-verdict motion is 10

21 days after entry of judgment, rather than 10 days after

22 verdict, as it used to be. But this Court said, in

23 Johnson, that, in the absence of a renewed verdict post-

24 -- a renewed motion post-verdict, neither the District

25 Court nor the Court of Appeals may order entry of judgment

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in the favor of the verdict loser. And I think that the

2 text of Rule 50(b) bears that out. If you look farther

3 down that paragraph, on page 58(a), the rule says,

4 "Submission of the case to the jury is to be treated -- or

5 considered to be a reservation of the legal question."

6 And then it said, "The movant may renew the request." And

7 then that sentence says, "In ruling on a renewed motion,

8 the Court may, if a verdict was returned, allow the

9 judgment to stand or grant a new trial or order entry of

10 judgment." And I think that phrase, "in ruling on a new

11 -- renewed motion," is significant, because the only

12 express authority that the District Court has, post-

13 verdict, to grant judgment as a matter of law is that the

14 court may do so in ruling on a renewed motion. The rule

15 doesn't contemplate a situation --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: So, you're saying that if the

17 judge wants to do what I -- what I hypothesized, the judge

18 should say to the losing party, "Renew your motion, and

19 I'll grant it."

20 MR. STEWART: That's correct. And the judge

21 could do that, either pre- or post-verdict. That is, pre-

22 verdict, the judge could say, "I think your motion may

23 very well have merit, but, in the interest of overall

24 efficiency, I'm going to submit the case to the jury.

25 But, in the event that the jury comes back against you, I

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 would encourage you to renew that motion." There's

2 nothing wrong with the judge encouraging the litigant to

3 file something like that, or signaling that the judge has

4 doubts about the sufficiency of the evidence. But the

5 rule makes the renewed post-verdict motion a prerequisite

6 to entry of judgment as a matter of law, post-verdict.

7 And it --

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me, if we adopt

9 your position, what should a trial court do if he,

10 alternatively, would grant a new trial? Should he go

11 ahead and make that determination? He grants judgment

12 NOV. And then he really is thinking, "Well, I would have

13 granted a new trial." Should he go ahead and cover

14 himself against reversal by granting the new trial in the

15 alternative, or --

16 MR. STEWART: He should. And, indeed, this

17 Court, in -- as early as Montgomery Ward, have said that

18 was the better practice, and that requirement has since

19 been codified in what is now Rule 50(c), which says that

20 if the Court grants the motion for judgment as -- the

21 renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, and there

22 is also an alternative motion for a new trial, the judge

23 should rule on that, as well, and should basically say,

24 "In the event that my ruling on the JNOV -- or the JMOL"

25 --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: "Shall." It does say "shall.

2 MR. STEWART: Yes, "shall."

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It says "shall." Thank you.

4 MR. STEWART: So, "In the event that my ruling

5 on the sufficiency question is reversed on appeal, the

6 Court of Appeals will know how I would have ruled on the

7 new-trial motion, and the processing of the case can be

8 expedited."

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a -- it's a conditional

10 ruling on the new-trial motion.

11 MR. STEWART: That's correct.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because if it were a ruling

13 on the new-trial motion, you would never get up to the

14 Court of Appeals.

15 MR. STEWART: That's correct. But the Court --

16 this Court, in Montgomery Ward, noted that there may be

17 inefficiencies if the District Court rules on the JNOV

18 motion, but doesn't rule on the conditional motion for new

19 trial, because if the JNOV -- if the ruling on the JNOV

20 motion is reversed on appeal, then there's a need for

21 remand for further proceedings, and it's inefficient.

22 But to return to the point about taking an

23 appeal from a Rule 50(a) motion, I think it would put a

24 District Court in an untenable position to say, "You can

25 reserve ruling on the 50(a) motion, even if you think the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 evidence is insufficient," and, indeed, it's usually the

2 better practice to do so, but, if you do that, and the

3 jury comes back against the movant, the movant can take an

4 immediate appeal, and you can be reversed on the ground

5 that your ruling on the Rule 50(a) motion was erroneous.

6 There's simply no -- by its -- by the terms of the rule

7 itself, the submission of the case to the jury, in the

8 face of a Rule 50(a) motion, is considered to be a

9 reservation of the sufficiency question.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, I don't know that

11 you have to read it that way. I mean, you can say that

12 the -- when the -- when the rule says that it -- that it

13 is deemed to have been reserved, it also implies that the

14 question that was reserved is implicitly resolved when the

15 court does not -- does, later, not act. It's an implicit

16 denial. Why can't you read the rule that way?

17 MR. STEWART: I mean, conceivably you could have

18 read the rule that way at the time of Johnson, but first

19 we have this Court's decision in Johnson, which says the

20 submission of a post-verdict Rule 50(b) motion is an

21 essential prerequisite even for the District Court to act

22 on the motion. And, therefore, if the motion is not

23 renewed, the District Court is entitled to treat it as

24 abandoned. And, second, the rule, in its current form,

25 limits the authority of the District Court to enter a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 judgment as a matter of law post-verdict to the situation

2 where the court is ruling on a renewed motion. The rule

3 doesn't contemplate a situation in which the motion is not

4 renewed and yet the District Court purports to rule on the

5 50(a) motion that was left hanging by the submission of

6 the case to the jury.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the plain-

8 error question?

9 MR. STEWART: I think we would say, for some of

10 the same reasons that Mr. Bailey has identified, that

11 plain-error review would be inappropriate, because in

12 order to have plain error, there has to be error. And if

13 the gravamen of the appeal is that denial of the pre-

14 verdict Rule 50(a) motion was plain error, it can't be

15 right, because the pre-verdict -- the submission of the

16 case to the jury is treated, as a matter of law, as a

17 reservation of the legal questions, and it can't be plain

18 error to reserve those questions for later decisions.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr. Stewart.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I understood. Sorry. Just

22 -- I'm not sure I understood. Did you say that even when

23 it's reserved, the judge cannot go back to the reserved

24 motion and grant it unless the motion is renewed?

25 MR. STEWART: That's correct. That was -- that

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 was the fact in Johnson, that the District Court expressly

2 reserved its ruling, and the court, nevertheless, held

3 renewal as essential.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Stewart.

5 Mr. Schroeder.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. SCHROEDER

7 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

8 MR. SCHROEDER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10 Before getting to some of these questions that

11 have been discussed this morning, I think it's helpful to

12 ground ourselves a little bit in the fundamental decision

13 made by the Federal Circuit that is not within this

14 Court's grant of certiorari, and, therefore, is the

15 foundation from which we proceed. And, rather succinctly,

16 the Federal Circuit said, "Unitherm never presented any

17 evidence that could possibly support critical factual

18 elements of its claim. In particular, Unitherm failed to

19 present any facts that could allow a reasonable jury to

20 accept either its proposed market definition or its

21 demonstration of antitrust injury."

22 Building on that foundation, Unitherm wants a

23 judgment entered in its favor for $19 million for the

24 injury that they have never proven. And, to get there,

25 they have to accomplish each of three things. First --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just stop you with that

2 point? Because one of the things that Unitherm said about

3 that argument -- which, as you prefaced, is not before us

4 -- is, the Court of Appeals was looking to a truncated

5 record to see whether there was sufficient evidence that,

6 in fact, the record was much larger than the piece of it

7 that the Federal Circuit examined, so that the Federal

8 Circuit, when it says there was no evidence, was looking

9 to the appendix that was before us, but that was not the

10 whole picture.

11 MR. SCHROEDER: Your Honor, in the Federal

12 Circuit, each party had the -- had the ability to put any

13 part of the record, or the entire record, before the

14 court, and, under the Federal Circuit's own rule, they

15 were also entitled to go back to the District Court

16 record, whether it was in the appendix or not. So, the

17 entire record --

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if they had

19 been on --

20 MR. SCHROEDER: -- was --

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- if they had been on

22 notice that insufficiency of the evidence was going to be

23 an issue, they might have put more in the record about the

24 sufficiency of the evidence.

25 MR. SCHROEDER: When the case was appealed to

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the Federal Circuit, Your Honor, insufficiency of the

2 evidence was presented as an issue at that time. And so,

3 that was --

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But under this Federal

5 Circuit's own law, it could not be, because there had not

6 been the post-verdict motion.

7 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, that --

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Federal Circuit is

9 borrowing Tenth Circuit's law for this purpose, but the

10 Tenth Circuit's law, as I understand it, has -- is the

11 position that was just presented to us by Mr. Stewart.

12 That is, if you don't make what used to be called the

13 JNOV, even if you made the directed verdict, you can't

14 raise the sufficiency on appeal.

15 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, going to the

16 Federal Circuit, of course, the meaning of Rule 50 was in

17 dispute. And it was certainly, at that point, ConAgra's

18 position that the evidence was sufficient -- was

19 insufficient, and that was the issue before --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't --

21 MR. SCHROEDER: -- the court.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that the Federal Circuit's

23 own rule? It -- it was, I thought, pretty clear what it

24 told us in that footnote, that if we were ruling -- making

25 the ruling -- the Federal Circuit law is, if you don't

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 make the 50(b) motion, you cannot get a reversal on appeal

2 for insufficient evidence.

3 MR. SCHROEDER: That is the Federal Circuit rule

4 in patent infringement cases. It was not the rule that

5 the Federal Circuit would apply in this case, because the

6 Federal Circuit would apply --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Borrow --

8 MR. SCHROEDER: -- apply the rule of --

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the Tenth Circuit rule.

10 MR. SCHROEDER: Yes.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But that's -- in

12 respect to the Chief Justice's question, the -- Unitherm

13 could have thought, "Well, the Federal Circuit is not

14 going to deal with sufficiency; therefore, I don't have to

15 beef up" --

16 MR. SCHROEDER: Well --

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- "what I put in the

18 appendix."

19 MR. SCHROEDER: -- certainly, they did have to

20 deal with that, Your Honor, because one of the grounds for

21 appeal was that there as no antitrust standing. So, this

22 issue was before the Federal Circuit, no matter how you

23 view the question. But I think in addition to that,

24 certainly everyone knew, when this case went to the

25 Federal Circuit, that it was ConAgra's position that Tenth

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Circuit law applied, and that the evidence should be

2 reviewed for its sufficiency --

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the -- the antitrust

4 standing issue is not the same as the relevant market

5 issue that was decided, is it?

6 MR. SCHROEDER: No, it's not, but it certainly

7 is the same with respect to antitrust injury, and the

8 Federal Circuit found there was no evidence of antitrust

9 injury. So, there, the entire record should have been

10 before the Federal Circuit. And, in fact, it was. And

11 so, when they made the determination that there was no

12 evidence of antitrust injury, they did that in the

13 presence of a full record on that issue. There was no way

14 that anyone could have thought that that issue was not

15 before the --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or as much of the record as the

17 other side wanted to produce.

18 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, we have to assume they

19 covered their bases, Your Honor, yes.

20 Now, let me talk a little bit about some of

21 these issues that have come up.

22 First, with respect to the motion for a new

23 trial, there was a motion for a new trial, under Rule 59,

24 filed in this case. The grounds for that motion were not

25 sufficiency of the evidence; but, under Rule 59, when a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 motion is made for a new trial, on any grounds, it is

2 before the District Court on all grounds.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm looking at the motion

4 that you made, which was not in the first instance for a

5 new trial; it was for a remittitur. This is on page 34(a)

6 of the joint appendix. And you made a motion, in the

7 alternative, for a new trial on antitrust damages, not

8 liability. So, I was really struck by the statement in

9 your brief that you had, indeed, made a motion for a new

10 trial. You made it a motion for a remittitur and, in the

11 alternative, a new trial, limited to damages. You said

12 nothing about a new trial on liability.

13 MR. SCHROEDER: That's correct, Your Honor. I'm

14 merely pointing out that, under Rule 59, once a motion for

15 a new trial is made, all issues relating to a new trial

16 are before the court.

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: A new trial on damages --

18 that's all you asked for -- not a new trial on liability.

19 MR. SCHROEDER: That's correct, Your Honor. But

20 I certainly would refer the Court to the Cone case, which

21 I think is very similar to this case, procedurally. In

22 Cone, there was a Rule 59 motion. There was no Rule 50(b)

23 -- excuse me, a Rule 50(a) motion, no Rule 50(b) motion.

24 There was a motion for a new trial on the grounds of newly

25 discovered evidence. Nevertheless, in the Cone case, the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Court remanded the case for further proceedings, and the

2 -- and the court below considered the question. And, in

3 the end -- the published opinions indicate, that case went

4 back to the Fourth Circuit, and --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It --

6 MR. SCHROEDER: -- in the end --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- it was -- the new trial

8 request had to do with liability --

9 MR. SCHROEDER: Yes.

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- whether it was for newly

11 discovered evidence or something else. But you -- your

12 motion was limited to damages. And I really don't think

13 that you can get where you want to go from a motion that

14 is limited to damages, when you didn't need to. You could

15 have made a motion for a new trial on the whole case.

16 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, of course, Your Honor, if

17 there were no proof of damages, the whole antitrust claim

18 would fail. But I would also say that it seems to me that

19 when a motion is made under Rule 50(a) for judgment as a

20 matter of law, that certainly permits the District Court

21 to grant a new trial, because it's a lesser remedy. And

22 we see situations all the time --

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why -- it's -- why

24 is that a lesser remedy? It's just different. I mean,

25 remittitur is a lesser remedy, too, but you don't say,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 "Well, if you've made a motion for a new trial, and then

2 that falls by the wayside, you -- the court can do

3 remittitur." The approach seems to be, "Something's wrong

4 here, and we have to do something, so what is it that we

5 can do?" And you look around, "Well, maybe we can give

6 them a new trial, or maybe we can have a remittitur." But

7 there are different motions for all these different

8 things, and, if they haven't been made, they seem to be

9 off the board.

10 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, certainly, Your Honor --

11 let's take another example. Suppose a litigant asks, as

12 sanctions, that the case be dismissed. Well, the District

13 Court certainly could say, "Well, you have a point,

14 sanctions are in order. But I'm not going to dismiss the

15 case, I'm going to give you something else." There are

16 many situations like that, where a particular remedy --

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the problem there is

18 still the same. Whatever it is that gave rise to the

19 motion to dismiss as a sanction -- the misconduct by

20 counsel -- you're still addressing that same problem. But

21 a new trial addresses different issues than a judgment as

22 a matter of law, and remittitur addresses different issues

23 than a new trial.

24 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, it seems to me that it is

25 the principal point of the trilogy that when a motion is

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 made for entry of judgment based on insufficiency of the

2 evidence, that raises the question of whether there ought

3 to be a new trial. That was the principal point discussed

4 in the trilogy, that you really can't have one without the

5 other.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The principal point was that

7 the Court of Appeals could not enter -- direct the entry

8 of judgment as a matter of law if a 50(b) motion had not

9 been made. That's what those three cases --

10 MR. SCHROEDER: That's --

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- invoke.

12 MR. SCHROEDER: -- absolutely correct, Your

13 Honor, the trilogy stands for that proposition. But in

14 all three cases of the trilogy, even though there was no

15 Rule 50(b) motion, those cases were all remanded. In no

16 case was the verdict winner who had insufficient evidence

17 allowed to prevail. They just remanded the cases. So,

18 the Solicitor General relies on stare decisis, but he's

19 asking the Court to do something radically different from

20 what happened in any of those cases of the trilogy.

21 They're asking that judgment be entered for the party that

22 failed to --

23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Had Rule 59 motions been made

24 in those cases?

25 MR. SCHROEDER: It's not clear from the record,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 I don't believe, as to all of the cases, Your Honor, but

2 certainly it is clear in the first case, the Cone case,

3 that there was a motion for a new trial, but it was

4 based on different grounds. It was based on newly

5 discovered evidence.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: So far, you're halfway into

7 your argument. I thought the basic question here was,

8 first, whether a Court of Appeals, or anybody, can grant a

9 J- -- what used to be called a JNOV without your making

10 its -- whatever it's called now -- and without somebody

11 making it a motion. And from your not opposing that, I

12 guess the answer to the question is, of course not. Of

13 course you have to make a motion. You have to make a

14 motion for everything. The judge is not a genius. He

15 can't -- is not a mindreader. And if you don't make a

16 motion, you lose. Okay? Now, is there any argument

17 against that?

18 MR. SCHROEDER: When you say "that," Your Honor,

19 you mean with respect to the -- to the new trial or with

20 respect --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I -- I mean, I thought --

22 there are two parts to this. Question one is, Can you

23 possibly get a judgment -- what used to be called a JNOV

24 or a JMOL or whatever -- from the Court of Appeals, when

25 you didn't make a motion for it, after the jury came in,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in the District Court?

2 MR. SCHROEDER: The --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: They say, "Of course you have

4 to make a motion." And, so far, I've heard no response

5 whatsoever to what I'd think is a fairly basic question in

6 this case. And I'm assuming: of course you have to make a

7 motion.

8 MR. SCHROEDER: Yes, Your Honor. I'm glad you

9 raised that point, because it is the fundamental point of

10 the case. Rule 50(a) provides that a motion for judgment

11 as a matter of law can be made, and specifically says that

12 the judge can grant that motion. And then the rule goes

13 on to say that that motion is deemed to continue to be

14 pending. There is nothing in Rule --

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, it doesn't say it -- it is

16 deemed to continue to be pending. The issue is deemed to

17 be reserved.

18 MR. SCHROEDER: Yes, Your Honor.

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Which is a very different

20 issue. In other words, it's not waived and over with at

21 that point, but it says nothing whatsoever, in express

22 terms, about pending motions.

23 MR. SCHROEDER: Oh, I agree, Your Honor. I

24 paraphrased the rule. But the point is that the motion is

25 still pending. In --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, the issue is reserved. The

2 motion has been ruled upon. The judge says, "No, I'm not

3 going to grant this motion before submitting the issue to

4 the jury." That's the end of the motion. The issue isn't

5 over with, because it can be raised again after the

6 verdict. Isn't that what the rule provides?

7 MR. SCHROEDER: That's certainly not the way I

8 would read it, Your Honor, because in this case --

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about a --

10 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: That's the way this Court has

11 read it. That's the problem.

12 MR. SCHROEDER: I don't believe so, Your Honor,

13 because if the Court -- if the rule says that the Rule

14 50(a) motion can be granted; conversely, it can be denied.

15 If it can be granted or denied, those decisions are

16 appealable under section 2106, which is the general

17 provision that orders of the court can be appealed. I do

18 not see anything in Rule 50 that says that denial of the

19 50(a) motion is not appealable. What Rule 50(b) does is

20 --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it can't -- it can't be

22 -- it would be interlocutory at that stage. It couldn't

23 be raised until final judgment is entered.

24 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, I think that

25 would be a most peculiar rule. Entering judgment in a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 case is one of the most fundamental and important things

2 that a court does.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you don't go up on

4 appeal with a final judgment rule, a firm final judgment

5 rule, as there is in the Federal system, from the denial

6 or refusal to act on a 50(a) motion.

7 MR. SCHROEDER: Well --

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The trial isn't over. There

9 is no judgment. You can't appeal til you have a final

10 judgment.

11 MR. SCHROEDER: That's certainly correct, Your

12 Honor, there can be no appeal without a final judgment.

13 But what I'm saying is that an interpretation of Rule 50,

14 as a whole, which says to the trial court judge that a

15 judgment should be entered without resolving the question

16 of whether there is sufficient evidence, and then take

17 that up later, under Rule 50(b), isn't a very good way to

18 proceed.

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there is, you know -- I

20 mean, this truly is a case where a page of history is

21 worth much more than logic. The reason for that somewhat

22 strange language is, at common law, it was thought, once

23 the jury came in with a verdict, that was it, the judge

24 had no power to overturn it, because of the Seventh

25 Amendment's Reexamination Clause, "no fact tried by a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the

2 United States, than according to the rules of common law."

3 And the rule of common law that is embodied in this

4 somewhat strange language in Rule 50 is that there could

5 be a reserved question so that after the jury comes in

6 with the verdict, the judge would be deciding the pre-

7 verdict question by this post-verdict motion. I mean,

8 there's -- none of this is in doubt, where this language

9 in 50 comes from. It comes from a need to adjust to the

10 Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment. Isn't that

11 so?

12 MR. SCHROEDER: Yes, that's all correct, Your

13 Honor. But if there were no provision of the rule that

14 reserved decision under 50(a), I would still say that the

15 denial of the 50(a) motion should be appealable when the

16 judgment is entered, because the -- all of the prior

17 orders of the court merge into that judgment when it's

18 entered.

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't get it out of

20 that language, because that language is there for the

21 specific purposes of allowing a judge, after their

22 verdict, to enter judgment NOV.

23 MR. SCHROEDER: Yes, Your Honor. It certainly

24 is there for that purpose. But the rule doesn't mandate

25 that the court -- that the case proceed by that route.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 What I'm saying is that once the 50(a) motion is made and

2 denied, the stage is set for an appeal pursuant to section

3 2106. The Rule 50(b) route is merely there to allow a

4 litigant, who does not believe that the issue has been

5 fully heard, briefed, considered by the court, to raise

6 the issue again, but not to put us in the position where,

7 in the normal course, the judge follows the usual

8 procedure of submitting the case to the jury, because the

9 jury may resolve the problem by deciding the case in favor

10 of the party that should win on the evidence, but then, at

11 that point, the judge merely has to enter -- has to enter

12 judgment in order to trigger the 50(b) motion. That

13 doesn't seem to be a good way to proceed, and I don't

14 believe that's what's contemplated by the rule. And, in

15 fact, it is a common practice among --

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He doesn't enter judgment to

17 trigger the 50(b) motion. The 50(b) motion is made in

18 between the verdict and the entry of judgment.

19 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, the rule says

20 that it can be made up to 10 days --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.

22 MR. SCHROEDER: -- after the entry of judgment.

23 So, from the point of view of the District Court, if the

24 court ever wants to get to the end, wants to put a time

25 limit on this, the only way to do it is to enter judgment.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 That forces the moving party to get a 50(b) motion --

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I don't --

3 MR. SCHROEDER: -- on account of the defendant.

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I don't follow that,

5 because you -- you know, I'm sure, that it's almost

6 routine that -- yes, you have the 10 days, the extra 10

7 days, under the rules -- but isn't it almost routine, at a

8 trial, that the verdict loser will say, "Judge, please

9 give me JNOV, or, if not, a new trial"? They don't wait

10 til after the judgment is made -- entered. They could.

11 But it's just -- well, in the trials I've seen, it's

12 almost by rote that lawyers who lose, where the jury comes

13 in for the other side, will renew the judgment-as-a-

14 matter-of-law motion and ask, in the alternative, for a

15 new trial. Isn't that the common practice?

16 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, I think it's a common

17 practice in those circuits which have indicated that a

18 50(b) motion is required to preserve all rights to

19 appellate review. Whether or not it is the common

20 practice in other circuits where that is not required, I'm

21 not sure. Certainly --

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it's not a question of

23 what is required or what is permissive, but isn't it to

24 the lawyer's advantage, to the client's advantage, to say

25 to the judge, sooner rather than later, "Look don't enter

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 judgment. Give me -- give me judgment NOV or at least a

2 new trial"?

3 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, this case may

4 be a little different from some, in that the precise issue

5 that was presented to the Federal Circuit, the failure of

6 proof, was something that was identified very early in the

7 case. And it was presented numerous times to the District

8 Court by a way of a summary judgment motion, by way of the

9 pretrial briefs. And the issue had not changed. And, in

10 fact, when the 50(a) motion was made, at the end of the

11 trial, the Court may have noticed that it was made in a

12 rather peculiar way, an attorney attempting to persuade

13 the court that that motion should be granted wouldn't

14 begin the motion by saying, "For the record." But that's

15 what happened here. It was known, at that point, that the

16 judge had made up her mind as to this issue, and wasn't

17 going to change it, and, in fact, declined, on several

18 occasions, to even listen to argument on the point. So,

19 the filing of a 50(b) motion would seem to be contrary to

20 the generally accepted practice that attorneys are not --

21 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if -- should we

22 disagree with you, Mr. Schroeder, on that, you seem to

23 fall back, at the end of the day, on a plain-error notion.

24 Is --

25 MR. SCHROEDER: Well --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- that right?

2 MR. SCHROEDER: -- there are several things that

3 we would fall back on, Your Honor. When you say "fall

4 back," I assume that that means if the Court were not to

5 follow the precedent of the trilogy --

6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: If we don't agree with you on

7 the --

8 MR. SCHROEDER: On the meaning of --

9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- need for a --

10 MR. SCHROEDER: -- the trilogy.

11 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- 50(b) motion.

12 MR. SCHROEDER: Okay. Under those

13 circumstances, there were two questions. One is, of

14 course, plain error, and the other is retroactivity.

15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Have we ever said that plain

16 error would preserve this, in the civil context?

17 MR. SCHROEDER: No, Your Honor. We have found

18 no case, either way --

19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: No, I --

20 MR. SCHROEDER: -- on that.

21 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- haven't either.

22 MR. SCHROEDER: It's -- there's no precedent

23 that --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: But even if there were, how

25 could this kind of error ever be plain?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SCHROEDER: Well --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Ever?

3 MR. SCHROEDER: Your Honor, I --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: If there's no evidence at all.

5 You have a patent, and a patent is a monopoly. And so,

6 what -- obviously, it monopolizes a market, it monopolizes

7 the market of the patent. And you'd have to be a genius in

8 antitrust law to know something's wrong with that

9 argument. And so, how could it all be plain?

10 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, there was

11 another claim in this case on which Unitherm did recover,

12 which is not before this Court, which was a claim for --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: That has nothing to do with my

14 question.

15 MR. SCHROEDER: Sure.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: You were saying that the

17 mistake was that there was not sufficient evidence that

18 there was injury of an antitrust kind, and that there was

19 a market. So, I'm saying a person who knows a little, but

20 not a lot, of antitrust law would think, "Obviously,

21 there's a market here. There's the market covered by the

22 patent."

23 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, there's not --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Obviously, there's injury,

25 because a patent allows you to raise the price. End of

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the matter. Now, that's naive, but somebody who doesn't

2 know antitrust law thoroughly couldn't possibly think that

3 there is plain error here. What's the response to that?

4 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, I think, Your Honor, first

5 of all, in determining plain error, it's necessary to put

6 it in the context of this case, where that very issue had

7 been raised repeatedly and had, in fact, been ruled on by

8 the court in denying the summary judgment motion. So, we

9 weren't dealing with someone who was naive in this

10 respect. We were dealing with someone who had faced this

11 precise issue, and the very closely related issue of

12 antitrust standing, which focuses on antitrust injury.

13 So, we got to this point in the trial. We had a great

14 deal of history --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm worried about, to put

16 all my cards on the table -- if we were to say there is

17 even a possibility of plain error in this case, the plain-

18 error exception in the rules would become a monster,

19 wherein complex cases, people who hadn't made the proper

20 motions would all be arguing plain error just as if they

21 had.

22 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, certainly the plain-error

23 argument is always, in a sense, available, Your Honor.

24 But I do think this is an extreme case, and I think that's

25 reflected by what the Federal Circuit said, that I read at

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the beginning of my argument. But that's extremely

2 strong.

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's an extreme case,

4 because there's insufficient evidence?

5 MR. SCHROEDER: It's an extreme case for a

6 number of reasons, and that's certainly one of them.

7 There isn't just insufficient --

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's --

9 MR. SCHROEDER: -- evidence, but --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- not going to be plain

11 error in every insufficient-evidence case.

12 MR. SCHROEDER: No, but in -- this is a -- an --

13 a case in which the insufficiency of the evidence was

14 extremely apparent. These parties --

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right, let's assume it's

16 extremely apparent. Isn't -- and assume, just for the

17 sake of argument, that we have a simple case, not a

18 complex case, so it's easy to see that, in fact, the

19 evidence falls short. It's still the case that this Court

20 has discouraged, or has certainly -- has either

21 discouraged the granting of motions at the close of the

22 plaintiff's case, or at the close of all the evidence --

23 in any event, has put its imprimatur on denying those

24 motions, subject to renewal after verdict. How can we

25 possibly find that there is plain error when a court does

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 exactly what we have encouraged them to do in order not to

2 waste a lot of trial time and jury time? How could we

3 ever find there is plain error, except with respect to the

4 renewed motion after the verdict?

5 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, certainly

6 where the motion has been made and has, in fact, been

7 briefed, and has been considered by the court, and where

8 you have a situation in which --

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: And we have said, "Don't grant

10 it."

11 MR. SCHROEDER: I'm sorry, Your Honor?

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: And we have said, "Don't grant

13 it."

14 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, I guess we'd

15 go back to the proposition that -- I believe that the

16 District Court could grant the 50(a) motion later; it did

17 not have to wait for a 50(b) motion. And, in fact, it is a

18 very common practice --

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: It could do that even after it

20 had ruled upon it and had denied it?

21 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, certainly in situations

22 where the Court simply enters judgment and doesn't deny

23 the motion first, that would be true --

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I --

25 MR. SCHROEDER: -- would be true. But --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- I --

2 MR. SCHROEDER: -- even here --

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- I will -- I will grant you

4 that, were it not for our cases, textually, the argument

5 you make is possible. But I don't see how you can make

6 that argument without our overruling a lot of law.

7 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, I -- when it

8 comes to "overruling a lot of law," I think that the

9 fundamental fact here is that, in the trilogy, the case

10 was always sent back for a new trial. Never was judgment

11 entered in favor of the party that had failed to prove its

12 case. So --

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Sent back to -- for a new

14 trial because the Court of Appeals ordered a new trial, or

15 sent back to the trial court for that court to decide as a

16 matter of that court's discretion, whether to order --

17 MR. SCHROEDER: That's correct. Sent back --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- a new trial? The latter.

19 MR. SCHROEDER: -- to the District --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it --

21 MR. SCHROEDER: -- Court.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- it was not -- but, here,

23 you're asking us to affirm something that a Court of

24 Appeals did.

25 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, the -- the Court of

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Appeals ruled that the case should go back to the District

2 Court. We are asking this Court to affirm that and send

3 the case back to the District Court, as a Federal Circuit

4 ruled.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not even sure your argument

6 is so strong on the text, frankly. I don't know why 50(b)

7 says -- it sets forth what can be done when the renewed

8 motion is made. You can, if a verdict was returned, allow

9 it to stand, order a new trial, direct entry of judgment.

10 If no verdict was returned, order a new trial, direct --

11 Why does the rule only say, "In ruling on a renewed

12 motion, the Court may"?

13 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't it say, "In ruling

15 on a renewed motion or in acting upon the motion

16 previously reserved," comma, "the Court may"?

17 MR. SCHROEDER: Well --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, where --

19 MR. SCHROEDER: -- I --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and where does it get the

21 power to do these things, in ruling on a motion previously

22 reserved, if it's not set forth there?

23 MR. SCHROEDER: If you look at 50(a), Your

24 Honor, it specifically says that the 50(a) motion can be

25 granted. Now, that would be inconsistent with a view of

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the rule that says that the only remedies available are

2 set forth in section (b) and triggered by the renewal of

3 the motion.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm talking about the only

5 remedy available after the motion has been reserved, after

6 --

7 MR. SCHROEDER: Well --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the court has declined to

9 rule on it once.

10 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, if the motion is reserved,

11 and the court has declined to rule on it, then the -- it

12 would seem to me that it follows that the court can grant

13 that motion.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's all.

15 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, it can also enter

16 judgment, which constitutes another denial --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can it order a new trial?

18 MR. SCHROEDER: Yes. Most certainly. Because

19 --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does he get that power,

21 under (a)?

22 MR. SCHROEDER: It is a --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless --

24 MR. SCHROEDER: It is a lesser remedy --

25 than the one requested, that was --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, well, then it shouldn't

2 have been set forth in (b). You didn't have to say it.

3 You could have just said, you know, "Allow" --

4 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, Rule 50(a) doesn't

5 literally say that the motion can be denied. It simply

6 says that it can be granted. But I think we have to infer

7 from that, that it can be denied. And I would equally

8 infer that a lesser remedy is possible once the 50(a)

9 motion is made. But I don't think it's possible to read

10 the rule as saying that the only way these remedies are

11 available is through a 50(b) motion, because that's

12 inconsistent with the provision that the motion can be

13 granted under 50(a).

14 The -- it, further, seems to me that if the --

15 if the motion is -- if decision on the motion is deemed to

16 be had -- to have been deferred, then that motion is still

17 before the court, even if the court has denied it. And

18 the court can grant it later on --

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the --

20 MR. SCHROEDER: -- instead of interjecting --

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- rule doesn't deem it to have

22 been deferred. A judge may, in fact, not rule on it,

23 although he does not grant it. But the rule does not say

24 that the motion is deemed to be deferred. The rule talks

25 about the issue being reserved, which is a different

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 thing. And the issue may be reserved whether the judge

2 rules on the motion or simply says, "I will take it under

3 advisement and you can renew it after the verdict if you

4 want to." Isn't that correct?

5 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, I would have stopped

6 sooner, Your Honor. I would have said, "I will take it

7 under advisement." That is really the essence of the

8 rule, that the Court has this under advisement. And it is

9 a very common --

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be, but it's

11 still the case that the rule does not deem the -- this

12 rule does not deem, in my terms, the ruling on the pre-

13 verdict motion to have been deferred.

14 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, it is

15 certainly a common practice that, while the --

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm asking you about what this

17 rule says. Did I just get the rule wrong?

18 MR. SCHROEDER: Well, Your Honor, I think that

19 if ruling on that motion --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: If you don't --

21 MR. SCHROEDER: -- had been inferred --

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- want to answer the question,

23 just say so.

24 MR. SCHROEDER: No, I'm -- I'm very pleased to

25 answer the question, Your Honor. I believe that the rule

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 permits the judge to decide the 50(a) motion at any time

2 prior to entering judgment. And the judge can change his

3 or her mind on that at any time, because the issue is

4 still before the court.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can a judge grant a new trial

6 on a 50(a) motion?

7 MR. SCHROEDER: Yes, Your Honor.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.

9 MR. SCHROEDER: Thank you, Your Honor.

11 minute remaining.

12 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BURCK BAILEY

13 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

14 MR. BAILEY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree on the answer --

16 with the answer to the last question I asked? Can -- on a

17 50(a) motion, can a judge grant a new trial instead of

18 granting judgment?

19 MR. BAILEY: No, Your Honor.


20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't.


21 MR. BAILEY: The result ConAgra contends for 


22 here, may it please the Court, leads to some really bad

23 results. It requires the rejection of longstanding

24 precedent by this Court. It overrules the jurisprudence

25 of eight circuits. It offends the special competency of

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

54
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the trial court. It deprives the appellate court of the

2 trial court's evaluation, an impartial evaluation of the

3 sufficiency of the evidence, so the appellate court is

4 left to sift through the record, an entire record,

5 searching for points that have never been joined below.

6 And it creates confusion, subjectivity, and differing

7 legal standards nationwide.

8 Thank you.
