1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:18 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 09-1279, Federal 5 Communications Commission v. AT&T, Inc. 6 Mr. Yang. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG 8 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS 9 MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 The court of appeals has held that FOIA's 12 statutory protection for personal privacy in 13 Exemption 7(C) extends beyond the privacy of individuals 14 and protects the so-called personal privacy of 15 corporations. That holding is inconsistent with the 16 text of Exemption 7(C), FOIA's broader context, and the 17 statute's drafting history, and would lead to anomalous 18 results. 19 The word "personal," standing alone, refers 20 to individual -- an individual human being. "Privacy," 21 standing alone, and even more so in the context of the 22 phrase "invasion of privacy," invokes purely individual 23 concepts. And the sum of those terms -- that is, the 24 statutory phrase used in FOIA, "personal privacy" -- is 25 greater than the sum of its parts. It's long been well

1 settled that corporations have no personal privacy. 2 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it true that there are 3 contexts in the law in which the word "personal" is used 4 to refer to a corporation? For example, you could refer 5 to personal jurisdiction over a corporation, couldn't 6 you? 7 MR. YANG: There are -- the term "personal" 8 is sometimes used as a term of art, and I think personal 9 jurisdiction is one of those. It is the modern, shorter 10 term of art for jurisdiction in personam and reflects a 11 distinction drawn still in the law between cases brought 12 in personam and cases brought in rem. 13 That -- the evolution of that term in the 14 law as a term of art does not reflect what the ordinary 15 meaning of "personal" is. It's just the same as the 16 term "personal property," which also invokes 17 long-established traditional distinctions between 18 property that could be recovered in rem or in real 19 actions versus property that might be recovered in 20 actions in personam. 21 So -- and, in fact, I think it -- it's 22 important to note that there are -- although maybe there 23 are some instances that -- I think there's one instance 24 that AT&T cites in its brief. Nothing -- it never cited 25 any use of the term "personal" to mean corporate or
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 pertaining to a corporation. And when -- when you - 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- what about 3 personal appearances? 4 MR. YANG: A personal appearance, I think 5 that -- that supports our position as well. If you're 6 making a personal appearance, it's not something that a 7 corporation does. A corporation is a -- a legal 8 construct. It doesn't exist as a thing that can make an 9 appearance. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in ordinary speech, 11 the term "personal" is not -- the term "person" is not 12 used to refer to a corporation. That's -- that's 13 legalese. But in -- but since the -- the Administrative 14 Procedure Act defines a person to include a corporation, 15 why is it relevant here or dispositive here to look to 16 the ordinary usage of term "personal" as opposed to the 17 way it's -- it's used in the law? And in the law, it is 18 sometimes used to refer to a corporation. 19 MR. YANG: Well, I think that -- that point 20 actually reinforces our position, because although 21 "person" is used in certain legal contexts to refer 22 to artificial persons and corporations and the like, 23 "personal" is not. 24 And "personal," as we explain in our brief, 25 is not simply a grammatical alteration, an inflection of
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the term "person." It has existed in its own right 2 since the late 1300s and has developed meaning that is 3 unique to the term "personal," which - 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yang, can we go back 5 first to this -- the request came in and, as I 6 understand it, the Commission said there are two 7 exemptions: The one for trade secrets, commercial, 8 financial confidential information; and then there was 9 one with Exemption 7 itself but as to the employee. 10 MR. YANG: Correct. There was an additional 11 exemption, Exemption 5, which protected internal 12 government communications. But - 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does the -- does the 14 Commission, unaided by AT&T, go through the papers and 15 decide what would be embarrassing for an AT&T employee, 16 as distinguished from the corporation? 17 MR. YANG: How does it do that? 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 19 MR. YANG: Well, I -- I don't think the 20 touchstone is necessarily embarrassment. What the 21 government does, following this Court's decision in 22 Reporters Committee, is tries to determine whether there 23 is a personal privacy interest about individuals, and 24 that is information that pertains to particular 25 individuals.

1 For instance, in this Court's decision in 2 DOD v. FLRA, the Court explained that, although an 3 agency released the name of individuals, it could 4 properly withhold the addresses, the home addresses, of 5 those individuals, even though that might be publicly 6 available in phone books, because individuals have at 7 least some small personal privacy interest in that. 8 So what the agency will do is try to 9 identify information pertaining to individuals and then 10 will conduct -- if there is certain information, will 11 try to conduct a balancing to determine whether there is 12 a public interest in disclosure, that is, whether 13 revealing this would disclose information against the 14 government. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in that instance, 16 does the corporation have standing to raise that 17 objection on the employee's behalf? 18 MR. YANG: Well, I think the corporation to 19 the -- in a reverse FOIA case, for instance, which is 20 what we have here, where the corporation is alleging 21 that the government's decision-making process is 22 arbitrary and capricious, it has Article III standing to 23 resist the disclosure of documents. If you're using 24 standing kind of like a Fourth Amendment concept of 25 standing, I don't think that -

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as an administrative 2 matter, can the corporation make a FOIA objection on 3 behalf of its employees? 4 MR. YANG: It can make an objection on its 5 own behalf, which is to say that the government has not 6 properly gone through the decision-making process by 7 not - 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. That's the 9 next -- that was going to be my next question: So the 10 corporation can raise FOIA on its own behalf? 11 MR. YANG: It's actually -- let me take a 12 step back. FOIA actions are actions which seek to 13 increase the amount of documents that the government has 14 released pursuant to a FOIA request. 15 We have also reverse FOIA actions, which are 16 actions under the APA and here under the Hobbs Act's 17 review provisions, that would give the court of appeals 18 jurisdiction. When there's a reverse FOIA action, the 19 claim is that the agency's final agency action is 20 somehow arbitrary, capricious, and not -- or contrary to 21 law. And so in this case, the FCC has certain 22 regulations which govern its processing of FOIA 23 requests. And AT&T's claim, as we understand it, is 24 that the FCC did not comply with its regulations, and, 25 therefore, its decision was arbitrary capricious because
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 its regulations required that it consider the personal 2 privacy interest of individuals. 3 And I should note that, with respect to 4 Exemption 6 or Exemption 7(C), the government itself 5 invokes personal privacy of individuals. That's what we 6 do when we process FOIA requests, because individuals 7 normally don't get any notice that there has been a FOIA 8 request. The government simply processes it and asserts 9 those rights, in a sense that they're rights, asserts 10 those interests on behalf of corporations -- on behalf 11 of individuals. 12 Going back to the text of the statute, the 13 term "privacy," and particularly an invasion of privacy, 14 invokes concepts that back to Warren and Brandeis's 15 right of privacy, the -- their article which explained 16 that or identified in the law certain human dignitary 17 interests that they gave the label "privacy." 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, privacy 19 certainly isn't as limited as you argue "person," 20 "personal," is. Corporations have private property. 21 They have private documents. The concept certainly 22 applies in the corporate context as it does in the 23 individual. 24 MR. YANG: I think the term "privacy," its 25 ordinary meaning, not the only meaning but the ordinary
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and the commonly used meaning, does invoke individual 2 concepts. When corporations or other entities are at 3 issue, normally the more appropriate word would be 4 "confidentiality" or "secrecy." Those concepts - 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have 6 confidential property or secret property. You have 7 private property. 8 MR. YANG: Well, true. But it's is not 9 privacy. When we're talking about the right of privacy, 10 those -- that word we think -- again going back to 11 Warren and Brandeis and up through the fifties and 12 sixties when Prosser was elaborating the law of torts in 13 his groundbreaking article on privacy, those concepts 14 apply only to individuals, and particularly when you 15 combine the terms. 16 I mean, the Restatement makes clear, and 17 back to Prosser it was clear, that corporations have no 18 right of personal privacy. So when Congress in 1974 was 19 enacting Exemption 7(C), there would have been no basis 20 for it to conclude that the rights that it was 21 conferring through the phrase "personal privacy" would 22 confer rights not -- beyond individuals, to 23 corporations, and by necessarily implication, if AT&T is 24 correct, foreign governments, State governments, local 25 governments. There's no predicate for those types of
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 entities having personal privacy in the law. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yang - 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Our cases assert, do they 4 not, that the exceptions to FOIA should be narrowly 5 construed? 6 MR. YANG: There are cases - 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: And we've said that on a 8 number of cases. 9 MR. YANG: In certain contexts, this Court 10 has indicated that exceptions are to be narrowly 11 construed. We think that, when read in context, those 12 cases and other cases of this Court explain that FOIA's 13 exemptions are to be given meaningful reach, because 14 what Congress was trying to do in FOIA -- and this is 15 somewhat against our interest in this case, and we 16 explain it more fully in our brief in Milner, which is 17 currently pending to the Court -- what Congress was 18 trying to do in FOIA was to establish a general 19 principle of disclosure, but in the exemptions it 20 identified very important interests that warranted an 21 exception from those general rules. And to narrowly 22 construe the exception, we think, would distort rather 23 than advance congressional purpose in enacting FOIA. 24 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose Congress had used 25 the phrase "privacy of a person," "privacy of any
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 person." Would you make the same argument? 2 MR. YANG: Our argument would be a little 3 different, particularly in the context of Exemptions 6 4 and 7(C), where the phrase would be "an invasion of 5 privacy of any person." 6 We think, particularly when we're talking 7 about invasions of privacy, even though a corporation 8 might have a broader definitional meaning in context, 9 Congress in that case would still, we think, be 10 referring to individuals. But, of course, that's not 11 this case. That would make it a little bit more 12 difficult. We think we would probably still prevail on 13 that reading. But - 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the Privacy 15 Act? The Privacy Act undoubtedly concerns individuals, 16 human individuals - 17 MR. YANG: Correct. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- not artificial beings. 19 But it uses the words "individual privacy" - 20 MR. YANG: Well, it actually uses both 21 phrases. It uses, as we explain in our brief, the 22 phrase "personal privacy" to explain that that's what 23 the Act was protecting. And then within the operative 24 portions of the Act, it uses "individual," but it does 25 so for a very specific reason. Congress was intending
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to protect a subset of individuals, and it defined the 2 term "individual" to mean U.S. citizens and lawful 3 permanent residents. 4 So not all individuals would be protected by 5 the Privacy Act. Now, Congress did that, not because 6 had it used the phrase "personal privacy" it would have 7 been extending rights to corporations and foreign 8 governments, but because personal privacy would have 9 been too broad in that it would have -- even though it 10 would have been limited to individuals, it would have 11 included a set of individuals that Congress wanted to 12 exclude, that is, everybody who is not a U.S. citizen or 13 lawful permanent resident. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask you a 15 question? I'm not sure I understood your response to 16 Justice Scalia. If there is ambiguity, if a term can be 17 given two meanings, and it's not clear -- and I know 18 you're challenging the clarity question here -- I 19 thought that Congress's intent to have full disclosure 20 would necessarily mean that where there's ambiguity as 21 to the meaning of an exception, then we should change 22 the narrowest meaning. 23 MR. YANG: Well, I think we disagree, and I 24 think this is why: No legislation pursues its primary 25 goal at all costs, and the FOIA exceptions that are at
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 issue here protect very important values that Congress 2 deemed to warrant exceptions from the rule. And so if 3 the Court were to put a thumb on one scale of that 4 balance that Congress has tried to strike, after using 5 all the normal tools of construction, we think that 6 would distort rather than advance the intent of 7 Congress. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that. 9 We're not putting a thumb on the scale. Taking account 10 of the fact that -- that Congress has many objectives in 11 any legislation and that the limitations are as 12 important as the -- the substantive end, nonetheless, 13 when, having applied all of that, you end up with, gee, 14 I don't know, it's ambiguous -- you say, even in that 15 situation, we don't apply the rule that - 16 MR. YANG: Well, if you were to -- after 17 using all the normal tools that the Court does and 18 you're - 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that's what 20 ambiguity means. It does -- it means - 21 MR. YANG: That's usually a very rare 22 instance, that you're exactly at equipoise. And -- and 23 we certainly aren't relying on narrow construction in 24 this case, Justice Scalia. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. The Government wants
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to abandon the principle that we've set forth in our 2 cases - 3 MR. YANG: Well, we think - 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that exceptions to FOIA 5 are to be narrowly construed. The Government does not 6 support that. 7 MR. YANG: We do not embrace that principle. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yang - 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though we did? I 10 mean - 11 MR. YANG: Well, we think that those 12 cases -- there are -- there are two lines of this 13 Court's decisions. Sometimes the Court explains that 14 exceptions are narrowly construed, and sometimes the 15 Court explained that its decision has given -- its 16 decisions have given the exceptions practical reach in 17 order to strike the appropriate balance that Congress 18 has tried to strike in FOIA. 19 Now, let me just say, our narrow 20 construction, to the extent the Court would want to 21 reaffirm it here -- we're not advancing that -- would 22 only help the Government's position. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your argument is based on 24 a case that will come before us. So -- but in this 25 case, it's to your interest to say, yes, that has been
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 -- that has been the Court's precedent, that FOIA 2 exceptions are to be narrowly construed. 3 MR. YANG: Well, the Government has broader 4 interests beyond a single case, and we think that, 5 again, we're not embracing strict construction in this 6 case. But, again, that would only help the Government's 7 position if you were to disagree. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not going to help 9 the Government's position if the Government doesn't want 10 to be helped. 11 (Laughter.) 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm happy to leave you 13 where you put yourself. 14 MR. YANG: And we -- we accept that in this 15 case, and we think that the language of the text, 16 particularly when read in context in light of the 17 statutory history, and particularly when you take a look 18 at what's gone on since 1974 -- I mean, in the more than 19 35 years since, there has been uniform agreement that 20 Exemptions 6 and 7(C) apply only to individuals. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose -- I 22 suppose families have rights of personal privacy, don't 23 they? 24 MR. YANG: Well, in certain contexts, family 25 members, as this Court decided in Favish, can have a
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 right to personal privacy. But the Court in Favish 2 recognized that that was a very, you know, significant 3 departure from the prior understanding that the right of 4 personal privacy in FOIA protects information about the 5 individual, him- or herself, and recognized that there 6 was another strain of personal privacy, which from 7 longstanding tradition in terms of -- within our 8 society, the Court could draw on in saying that personal 9 privacy should also protect, at least in the context 10 of - 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So in some 12 contexts -- in some contexts, personal privacy does go 13 beyond the individual? 14 MR. YANG: No, still it is individual. I 15 mean, those are individual members of the family. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Aggregations of 17 individuals? 18 MR. YANG: Well, no. I think an individual 19 member of the family has a personal privacy interest by 20 virtue of the relationship to the decedent in Favish. 21 Let me go back. Just -- I think I would be 22 remiss if I didn't remark upon this Court's decision - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. To go back to 24 the Chief's question, you do not deny that the 25 individuals who form the corporation, the officers and
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the employees, are protected by the right of personal 2 privacy, and, indeed, you will -- you will edit any FOIA 3 responses to protect those individuals, even though 4 there are many of them, right? 5 MR. YANG: Correct. If there were - 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: But as individuals, not as 7 -- not as the corporation. 8 MR. YANG: As individuals, because the 9 information pertains to them. 10 Now, going to the American Express case, 11 which we explain in our reply, I think that is fatal to 12 the proposition that -- the proposition of AT&T that 13 there's a grammatical imperative that adjectives take 14 the meaning of a related noun. 15 In American Express, the Court construed the 16 Truth in Lending Act, which includes the definition of 17 "person" to include, for instance, corporations. It 18 then went on to construe a term, "consumer," which 19 concerns transactions primarily for personal, family, 20 household, or, at the time, agricultural purposes. The 21 Court explained that a transaction -- the transaction 22 that was conducted for a corporation's business 23 purposes, that it could not -- there was -- "it did not 24 fall within any of the purposes specified" -- that was a 25 quote -- in the definition of "consumer." That is, it
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 did not concern personal purposes. We think that's 2 fatal. 3 The Court, in fact, said it was the only 4 possible conclusion and that there was no other possible 5 interpretation of the statutory phrase, after repeating 6 the enumeration of those four factors three times and 7 then on the very next page saying corporate -- a 8 transaction for corporate business purposes could not 9 be fit within that definition. 10 Finally, I'd like to remark upon the 11 anomalies that this Court would set us forth upon if it 12 were to decide that corporations have personal privacy. 13 At least in the context of individuals, 14 there's an established body of law and societal 15 understanding of what a person, an individual, might 16 have a personal privacy interest in. But if we expand 17 personal to include corporations, foreign governments, 18 State governments, local governments, defining what 19 would be personal privacy of those institutions would 20 require an extraordinary exercise, a simple policy 21 judgment on the part of the agencies first and then the 22 Court. 23 And this Court in Favish was careful to 24 explain that that type of decision making would be 25 improper in that appropriate guides to -- to limit and
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 make objective a court and agency's decision making is 2 required. 3 Congress provided no benchmarks, never 4 addressed corporate, foreign governments, or any other 5 non-human entity in the context of personal privacy. 6 And, again, for 36 years, there's been 7 uniform agreement that personal privacy applies in this 8 context only to corporations. 9 If there are no further questions - 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, if an 11 individual has been -- individual human being has been 12 investigated by the FBI and a FOIA request is made for 13 records related to that investigation, would the name of 14 the individual not be turned over? 15 MR. YANG: Well, if someone is asking for an 16 investigation of Tony Yang - 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. 18 MR. YANG: -- our -- I don't -- I can't say 19 definitively, but I think I can probably answer that 20 that even -- even answering the question of whether 21 there is a responsive record answers the question. So 22 I - 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the point. 24 So really your adversary is saying that the same harm 25 that occurs to an individual -- putting aside the
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 difficulty of defining privacy more broadly, but the 2 same harm that occurs to an individual who is disclosed 3 to have been the target of an investigation is an 4 identical privacy right of a corporation, that a 5 corporation has the same negative effects as the 6 individual. 7 MR. YANG: I think - 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I think they would 9 concede that privacy might need to be defined 10 differently for corporations. They're simply saying 11 this privacy interest is not. 12 MR. YANG: Well, the key point is that we 13 don't deny that corporations have some interest in 14 confidentiality that exists out there. For instance, 15 AT&T has relied upon the common law of defamation where 16 a corporation's business interests, business reputation, 17 is implicated. But even - 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, parts of -- they 19 pled guilty already. So it is hard to imagine how much 20 exponentially more damaging - 21 MR. YANG: Well, to be fair to AT&T, there 22 was a settlement agreement in which they did not admit 23 any wrongdoing. So - 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that presupposes 25 some sort of investigation. So that's public knowledge
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 already. 2 MR. YANG: That is public knowledge. But I 3 think the key point is that the corporate -- a 4 corporation's interests in maintaining its business 5 reputation has been not regarded as a personal privacy 6 interest. It's true that they have interests, and FOIA 7 protects those interests, for instance, interests in 8 confidential commercial or financial information under 9 Exemption 4. 10 And so what really the -- we come back to 11 the key point, which is when Congress used the phrase 12 "personal privacy," it would have had no reason in 1974, 13 or even now, to think that term would have referred to 14 corporations. The fact that corporations have other 15 interests and other rights that might be legitimate is 16 kind of beside the point because those interests are not 17 referred to in the law or otherwise as personal privacy 18 interests. 19 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Yang. 21 MR. YANG: Thank you. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Klineberg. 23 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEOFFREY M. KLINEBERG 24 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 25 MR. KLINEBERG: Thank you,
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 2 The question in this case is whether any 3 organization, including not only business corporations 4 like AT&T but also nonprofit organizations and political 5 associations, should be categorically excluded from 6 protection under Exemption 7(C), such that this 7 exemption will now offer less protection for privacy 8 interests than the Constitution and the common law. 9 This Court has consistently held that the 10 privacy protections under FOIA are broader. And the 11 text supports that position. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you include in this 13 the people, the persons that you say are shielded by 14 this privacy exemption, as Mr. Yang said, foreign 15 governments, State and local governments? Those have 16 all -- those all fall under the APA definition of 17 person. 18 MR. KLINEBERG: Justice Ginsburg, they do. 19 And we would agree that, as a matter of statutory 20 construction, the concept of personal privacy does apply 21 to those -- those other categories of actors. Now, 22 whether once that privacy interest is balanced against 23 the public's interest in disclosure, that balance may 24 well be different with respect to public or foreign 25 entities, but -- but certainly they -- they have a right
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to personal privacy under the terms of the statute. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you give us an idea 3 of -- the corporation has been shielded by Exemption 4 4 for its confidential financial information, trade 5 secrets; and its employees have been protected under 6 Exemption 7. 7 What is it, what would be -- would fall 8 within this privacy exception that would not be 9 confidential business information or relate to employees 10 of the corporation? 11 MR. KLINEBERG: Justice Ginsburg, we -- I 12 could give you two categories or kinds of examples. One 13 is, for example, a series of e-mails among corporate 14 officers -- granted, whose own personal names and 15 identifying information have been redacted, but in those 16 e-mails, they may engage in a frank exchange about the 17 competence and intelligence of a would-be regulator of 18 the corporation or a -- disparaging comments about 19 potential - 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Why does that 21 relate to their privacy? I don't understand that. Why 22 does that relate to the corporation's privacy interest? 23 Anything that would embarrass the corporation is -- is a 24 privacy interest? 25 MR. KLINEBERG: Well, Justice Scalia, the -
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the answer is simply that these were communications, 2 conversations, that were occurring with an expectation 3 of privacy by the individuals involved on behalf of 4 their employer, and to the extent that they could be 5 used to harm the reputation or the customer goodwill of 6 -- of the company, they do, indeed, have a -- a personal 7 privacy interest in - 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Anything that hurts the - 9 the -- the image or the goodwill of the company? 10 MR. KLINEBERG: Your Honor, everything that 11 with -- that is intended to be private is certainly 12 subject to the balancing that we're asking for under 13 Exemption 7(C); indeed, that Congress provided, that if 14 it's -- it's an interest in personal privacy, then it is 15 to be balanced to determine whether the disclosure of 16 that document is unwarranted. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Klineberg, can you give 18 me any example of -- your -- your brief talks a lot 19 about the adjective "personal." But we're not talking 20 just about the adjective "personal." What about the 21 phrase "personal privacy"? 22 "Personal," yes, can indeed apply to 23 corporations sometimes, but there are certain phrases 24 where it clearly does not. For example, you talk about 25 personal characteristics. That doesn't mean the
25

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 characteristics of General Motors. You talk about 2 personal qualities. It doesn't mean the qualities of 3 General Motors. You talk about a point of personal 4 privilege. It's not a privilege of a corporation. 5 And I think personal privacy is the same 6 thing. Can you give me any examples in common usage 7 where people would refer to the personal privacy of a - 8 of a corporation? It's a very strange phrase to me. 9 MR. KLINEBERG: Well, Your Honor, as 10 Justice Alito asked my -- my colleague earlier, the - 11 the whole concept of -- of "person" as including a 12 corporation would surprise many people, the proverbial 13 person on the street. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. I'm not talking about 15 that. I'll grant you that -- that "personal" could 16 sometimes refer to a corporation, although the 17 Government distinguishes it by etymology and so forth. 18 Never mind that. I'm talking about personal privacy. 19 Do you have any examples from the New York Times, from, 20 you know, Boswell, from anywhere, that anybody refers to 21 the interests of a corporation as the "personal privacy" 22 of General Motors? 23 I cannot imagine somebody using the phrase 24 like that. 25 MR. KLINEBERG: Your Honor, we're not aware

1 of that phrase being used certainly in any statutory 2 context - 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you were about to 4 give a second example of where, even though it hasn't - 5 personal privacy hasn't been used in -- but you said one 6 example is the two officials who are saying unpleasant 7 things about a regulator. And what was your other 8 example? 9 MR. KLINEBERG: Well, there's a -- there's a 10 sub-example within that category which is the 11 disparaging of an important customer, some unpleasant 12 comments about an important customer of the corporation 13 that could then be used quite -- quite clearly by a - 14 by a competitor to -- to harm the goodwill of the -- of 15 the corporation with respect to that customer. 16 But there is indeed another whole category 17 of documents that goes beyond the -- the context of 18 AT&T's interest here, and the example is internal 19 documents within, say, an environmental nonprofit 20 organization talking about their political strategies 21 for defeating an amendment to the Clean Air Act. 22 As an example, those political strategies 23 that were shared internally by -- by members of the 24 organization without any intent to -- to have them 25 become public would become subject to -- to automatic

1 disclosures, categorical disclosure, were the Government 2 to prevail in this case. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think it's - 4 how does that work? If you have -- the president of the 5 environmental organization says something about whatever 6 it is -- we can lobby this guy to get this change -- is 7 he able to protect that on the grounds of his personal 8 privacy, even though the embarrassment would go to the 9 -- the organization as a whole? 10 MR. KLINEBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, I believe 11 the answer is in most cases "yes," that in -- that the 12 identity of the -- the specific speaker and any 13 identifying information corresponding to him or her 14 would be protected. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why is it such 16 a big deal, then, to extend that to the organization as 17 a whole, if the individual's privacy is already going to 18 be protected? 19 MR. KLINEBERG: Indeed, Your Honor, I think 20 that is -- that is our position, that -- that the 21 personal privacy of the corporation is -- is affected by 22 such disclosure. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I mean 24 you're -- you're already protected, at least to a 25 significant extent, because the individual officers
28

1 would be able to assert a privacy interest, to the 2 extent at least that what you find embarrassing to -- to 3 the corporation is also individually embarrassing to 4 them. 5 MR. KLINEBERG: Right. But the -- but the 6 redactions that would occur would in all likelihood 7 simply be redactions of their names and perhaps their 8 titles, but their -- the substance of their comments 9 would certainly be -- would be disclosed under the 10 Government's view. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Are there any examples that 12 you have? That is, in the last 35 years, has there been 13 any instance where the Justice Department or some other 14 law enforcement agency compiled a file for law 15 enforcement purposes, that in that file there were, for 16 whatever reasons, a bunch of conversations about the 17 organization's strategy, and it did not interfere to 18 release it with -- with anybody's personal privacy, but 19 it might interfere with that organization's strategy, 20 and so the organization, whatever it was, the NRDC or 21 something, was very upset about it? 22 Did you find a single example or a thousand 23 examples? Or how many examples did you find of that 24 happening? 25 MR. KLINEBERG: Well, Justice Breyer, one of
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the -- one of the things that has puzzled us in this 2 case is why -- why it has taken 35 years - 3 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, one reason might be 4 that this has really never been a problem because all 5 the legitimate -- or most of them, anyway -- that these 6 organizations that have interests in privacy are 7 actually taken care of by the other 17 exemptions here. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Another reason might be 9 that personal -- nobody ever thought that personal 10 privacy would cover this. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: This may be the first one. 12 That's why I want to know, is there -- one of the things 13 you would have looked for is an example of a real 14 problem of the kind you're talking about. I'm not 15 saying you don't have one. I would just like to know if 16 you found any, and what they are, so I could read them. 17 MR. KLINEBERG: Your Honor, we haven't found 18 anything specific to the -- in response to your 19 question. 20 But I -- I will say that one of the 21 explanations for why this issue has become more 22 important today than maybe it has been in recent past - 23 there really are three reasons. One is that Exemption 24 4, which Mr. Yang discussed, has been increasingly 25 narrowed by the courts of appeals to the point where
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 they specifically say, and, indeed, the Government 2 concedes, that -- that the reputational concerns and the 3 harm to customer goodwill is not the sort of harm that 4 Exemption 4 guards against. 5 And so that has become increasingly clear 6 among the courts of appeals, that the interests in 7 confidentiality that we're talking about under exception 8 7(C) are not - 9 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, one possible reason 10 you don't find them is because it's very rare that a law 11 enforcement agency is going to try to subpoena the top 12 strategy of the -- of the NRDC, confidential strategy. 13 There might not be too many such records. 14 It -- another reason might be is that they 15 don't really care. Another reason might be -- I don't 16 know. 17 But if you haven't found any examples, what 18 we're back to -- or -- and maybe there are actual 19 examples of that -- of what you said to Justice Ginsburg 20 of the other instance, where the -- what was that first 21 one? 22 MR. KLINEBERG: Right. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: I'd like to know about the 24 example. What was the first one again? 25 MR. KLINEBERG: Well, the -- the first one
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 was comments -- comments about a regulator or - 2 JUSTICE BREYER: They're worried about 3 saying something mean about a regulator. Okay. Yes, 4 fine. Are there examples of that? Is this the first 5 one, and what's the empirical state? 6 MR. KLINEBERG: Your Honor, it's a -- I 7 cannot point you to specific examples. They're - 8 they're sort of hard to -- hard to find in the -- in the 9 sense that they are -- that they're not typically 10 litigated, and they certainly haven't been litigated 11 under -- under this -- under this exemption before. 12 But -- but I think the other explanation for 13 why this matters today in a way that it might not have 14 mattered so much before, two -- two other reasons: One 15 is that -- that increasingly, FOIA is being used by - 16 by competitors and legal adversaries to obtain 17 information, not about what the government is doing, not 18 about what the government is up to, but about what 19 evidence the government might have gathered from private 20 parties. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that a reason to 22 change what was the understanding of Exemption 7? One 23 of the items that doesn't work in your favor was the 24 Attorney General's memorandum at the time of the '74 25 amendments.

1 MR. KLINEBERG: Well, actually, Justice 2 Ginsburg, at the time of the '74 amendments the only 3 existing Attorney General memorandum was that of 4 Attorney General Clark, which read "personal privacy" - 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm talking about the -6 Attorney General Levi. 7 MR. KLINEBERG: Right, and that -- that was 8 issued subsequent to the amendments in 1974, and that 9 was an -- an interpretive gloss on the recent 10 amendments. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, that's what I meant. 12 MR. KLINEBERG: Right. And so at the time 13 that Congress enacted the amendments, both under the 14 Privacy Act as well as Exemption 7(C), the -- the only 15 existing statement about what personal privacy might 16 mean would be -- would have been Attorney General 17 Clark's understanding that personal privacy can in fact 18 incorporate interests of corporations. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: But if Attorney General 20 Levi's description, which was -- which was issued for 21 the purpose of telling all the agencies of the Federal 22 Government what this new statute meant -- and it had a 23 lot of ambiguities in it -- if that was wrong about - 24 about this subject, you'd have thought somebody would 25 have objected.

1 I mean, did some members of Congress who - 2 who had passed FOIA say this is outrageous; what about 3 the personal privacy of General Motors? I'm not aware 4 of any objections along those lines. 5 MR. KLINEBERG: Well, Your Honor, the -6 Attorney General Levi's memorandum did not go into a 7 long discussion or description of the -- of the 8 analysis. It simply said it does not appear or does not 9 seem to apply to -- to corporations. And it's 10 absolutely true. There -- this is not -- this issue 11 hasn't -- hasn't really been litigated and presented. 12 But our position is that there is nothing in 13 the plain language that would indicate that Congress 14 intended to categorically exclude corporations. It is 15 certainly true that the legislative history at the time, 16 as the Government spends quite a bit of time exploring, 17 does suggest that what was -- what was in most people's 18 minds was protection of individual privacy. But there 19 is no indication that they intended to exclude - 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it the burden of the 21 Government to show that they intended to exclude 22 corporations, or is it your burden to show that this 23 exception was meant to include corporations? I would 24 think the latter is where the burden lies in this case. 25 MR. KLINEBERG: Well, Justice Scalia, our -
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 our burden is to -- is to defend our view of the 2 statute. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but if you're asking 4 the Government to show that the -- there was an intent 5 to exclude corporations, I don't think that's their 6 burden. I think it's your burden to show that this 7 exemption was intended to include corporations. 8 MR. KLINEBERG: I agree, Your Honor, that we 9 are -- our burden is to demonstrate to you why the words 10 "personal privacy" in the statute apply to corporations. 11 I think one of the background facts is that there is no 12 indication that anyone thought that it was not to be 13 included. But let me - 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your 15 central argument is that because "person" is defined to 16 include corporation, "personal" in the same statute must 17 include corporate. 18 I tried to sit down and come up with other 19 examples where the adjective was very different from the 20 root noun. And it turns out it's not hard at all. You 21 have "craft" and "crafty." Totally different. "Crafty" 22 doesn't have much to do with "craft." "Squirrel," 23 "squirrelly." Right? 24 (Laughter.) 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, "pastor" -
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 you have a "pastor" and "pastoral." Same root, totally 2 different. 3 So I don't understand -- I don't think 4 there's much to the argument that because "person" means 5 one thing, "personal" has to be the same relation. 6 MR. KLINEBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, let me 7 try to explain precisely what our proposed rule of 8 construction is, because I think there's been some 9 confusion, and I -- and I think the Government has - 10 has not properly characterized it, and certainly in 11 their reply brief. 12 We do not agree -- or we do not sign on to 13 the term "grammatical imperative," because our concern 14 with that phrase is that it might suggest that the rule 15 is to be applied regardless of the consequences, and 16 that is not our position. 17 Our position is that where the adjective 18 means "of or relating to" a term that Congress has 19 expressly defined, that definition should be applied, so 20 long as it makes sense to do so in light of the text and 21 structure of the statute as a whole. 22 So, in this case, Your Honor, "personal" 23 does -- is defined -- when you open up the dictionary, 24 the very first definition is "of or relating to a 25 particular person." "Person" is, then, defined by
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Congress as -- to include not only individuals, but - 2 but corporations and other associations. 3 So in this particular context, it makes 4 perfect sense to look to - 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Klineberg, you have 6 read the brief of the Project on Government Oversight, 7 where they give dozens and dozens of examples to show 8 that, overwhelmingly, "personal" is used to describe an 9 individual, not an artificial being. And it is the 10 overwhelming use of "personal." 11 MR. KLINEBERG: Justice Ginsburg, we do not 12 dispute that personal is often, even many, many times, 13 used to describe an individual and can only be 14 understood in that context. Indeed, the Truth in 15 Lending Act argument that the Government made in its 16 reply brief is a perfect example. The word "personal" 17 there is -- is mentioned alongside "personal," "family," 18 and "household." 19 And, indeed, even in that very same 20 statutory definition of "consumer," the word is referred 21 to as "a natural person." So, in that context, it would 22 be absurd or inappropriate to -- to borrow the concept 23 of the definition of "person." 24 All we're saying is when it is not absurd, 25 when it is not -- does not do violence to the statute,
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 under those circumstances, it makes perfect sense to 2 borrow the definition that Congress provided. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would be similar to 4 medical files and such, under Exemption 6, that uses the 5 same phrase, "unwanted invasion on personal privacy"? 6 So what would your reading do to Exemption 6, and how 7 would we create or even make sense of Exemption 6? 8 MR. KLINEBERG: Your Honor, we don't believe 9 our reading does any -- any damage to this Court's 10 jurisprudence in Exemption 6, and the -- and the simple 11 reason is that while the words "personal privacy" in 12 Exemption 6 do mean -- and we agree with the Attorney 13 General Clark in this -- do mean that -- that -- the 14 same thing as it means in Exemption 7(C), but because - 15 precisely for the reason you said, Justice Sotomayor - 16 the personnel and medical and similar files limits the 17 likely scope of that privacy interest to individual, 18 natural -- natural persons. And that's simply not 19 because of the words "personal privacy," but because of 20 the company that those words keep in that -- in that 21 particular exemption. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why? I mean, if you're 23 saying that personal privacy has some overlap with 24 individual privacy -- obviously, it has to if you're 25 going to give meaning to personal privacy -- don't we
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 have to give meaning to "and similar files"? And so 2 what would those be? 3 MR. KLINEBERG: Well, Your Honor, as this 4 Court said in the Washington Post case, the 5 understanding of "similar files" is defined by the two 6 benchmarks that are expressly provided, right? 7 Personnel and medical. So the kinds of files are 8 limited to the sorts of files in which individual 9 information is likely to be contained. In that case, it 10 was a passport file. 11 Again, our -- our argument is simply that 12 it's that part of Exemption 6 that does the limiting 13 work in terms of its scope. The words "personal 14 privacy" mean the same thing in Exemption 6 as -- as 15 they do in Exemption 7(C). 16 The -- the other point that I -- I certainly 17 want to make clear is that our position is that personal 18 privacy is only the first step in the determination 19 whether or not a particular document is disclosed, 20 because if the Government prevails, there will be no 21 need even to articulate a public interest in the 22 disclosure of potentially harmful documents. Instead, 23 they will be automatically available to any competitor 24 or legal adversary. 25 And all we are asking for and, indeed, all
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that Congress provided for is that the privacy interest 2 be weighed against the public interest in disclosure. 3 And what the -- what the FCC did here was to 4 categorically exclude corporations from the protections 5 of Exemption 7(C). And -- and all we are saying is that 6 those interests are legitimate and just need to be 7 balanced. And what the government's obligations under 8 these circumstances are is that they need to weigh the 9 private interests in -- in the documents against the 10 articulated public interest in disclosure. And that 11 interest, of course, has to do with what the government 12 is up to. What do these documents tell us about what 13 the government is doing? 14 And if, as the amici on the Government's 15 side suggests, there are lots of public -- lots of 16 public value and public interest in the disclosure, then 17 that balance is more likely to be weighed in favor of 18 disclosure. And all we are asking for, though, is that 19 that balance take place. And what's happened here is 20 that -- is, as I said; it's a categorical exclusion that 21 simply is inconsistent with the terms that Congress laid 22 out in exemption 7(C). 23 Congress did not intend for FOIA to be a 24 tool for an organization's adversaries to obtain access 25 to harmful or embarrassing documents compiled for law
40

1 enforcement purposes where such documents do nothing to 2 open agency action to public scrutiny. If the 3 Government has its way in this case, the result will be 4 what this Court decried in Favish, which was that it 5 would be the failure to protect the privacy of citizens 6 against the uncontrolled release of information compiled 7 through the power of the state. 8 If there are no further questions, I urge 9 that the -- that the Third Circuit be affirmed. Thank 10 you. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 12 Mr. Yang, you have 6 minutes left. 13 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG 14 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 15 MR. YANG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 16 AT&T appears to have changed or at least 17 modified its position somewhat from the position 18 articulated at page 14 of its brief. There AT&T 19 says, "By expressly defining the noun 'person' to 20 include corporations, Congress necessarily defined the 21 adjective form of that noun -- 'personal' -- also to 22 include corporations." 23 Now, AT&T has given up on the grammatical 24 imperative that guided exclusively the court of appeals' 25 decision in this case. There's nothing left. AT&T can
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 provide no example where the term "personal privacy" has 2 ever been used to refer to a corporation, much less a 3 foreign government or State or local government in any 4 context, whether it be FOIA, the law generally, or even 5 in common usage. 6 AT&T can provide no example of any problems 7 that have arisen in over 35 years of the government's 8 consistent administration of this provision. In fact, 9 all indications point in simply one direction. Personal 10 privacy applies only to individuals. The terms 11 "personal" and the terms "privacy" do that alone. And, 12 together, "personal privacy makes" that clear. 13 The legislative history, the decisions of 14 this Court pointing to the balance applying only to 15 individuals, individual rights. All point in the same 16 direction. 17 We would ask that the Third Circuit be 18 reversed. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 20 Counsel. 21 The case is submitted. 22 (Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the 23 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 24 25
