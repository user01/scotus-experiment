1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:02 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 10-699, Zivotofsky v. 5 Clinton. 6 Mr. Lewin. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. LEWIN: Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice, and 10 may it please the Court: 11 In its recent decisions in Medellin v. Texas 12 and in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, this Court approved and 13 applied the familiar tripartite scheme that Justice 14 Jackson articulated in the Steel Seizure case. When the 15 President takes measures incompatible with the expressed 16 or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest 17 ebb. In that instance, said Justice Jackson, his claim 18 to a power at once so conclusive and preclusive must be 19 scrutinized with caution to preserve the equilibrium 20 established by our constitutional system. 21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Lewin, what power 22 is Congress exercising here? 23 MR. LEWIN: Justice Kagan, Congress has 24 exercised its power over passport -- the issuance of 25 passports under the immigration, naturalization, and
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 foreign commerce powers that Congress has. It has 2 enacted passport legislation back in 1856, in 1926. It 3 can control what the contents of a passport ought to be, 4 what its duration may be, how the application is to be 5 made. And we say this is an identification - 6 JUSTICE ALITO: But do you think - 7 MR. LEWIN: -- portion of the passport. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think it's relevant 9 that the title of section 214 is "United States Policy 10 With Respect to Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel"? 11 MR. LEWIN: Well, we think -- and we've 12 cited I guess in footnote 2 of our brief a number of 13 recent cases of this Court that have said that you take 14 each statutory provision independently and determine its 15 constitutionality. True, Congress has a broader view 16 with regard to the policy of Jerusalem being part of 17 Israel than the executive branch has had since 1948. 18 However, that purpose is not determinative of what the 19 constitutionality is of subsection (d). Moreover - 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you say, Mr. Lewin, 21 that -- you're not claiming exclusivity in Congress. 22 You say foreign relations is a shared power. So, if it 23 is a shared power, why does Congress trump the 24 executive? 25 MR. LEWIN: Because -- precisely because
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 under the standard of the Steel Seizure case and this 2 tripartite scheme, if Congress determines that what the 3 President has done -- and this is a statute which is 4 really very narrow and deals with past conduct by the 5 executive branch, as it were. It does not hobble the 6 President in terms of future foreign policy. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under your -- under 8 your theory -- and this is just following on Justice 9 Ginsburg's question, I think. Under your theory, what 10 foreign relations determinations are for the President 11 alone to make? 12 MR. LEWIN: Foreign relations determinations 13 are not left to the President alone. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there any foreign 15 relations determinations that are for the President 16 alone to make under your theory of the case? 17 MR. LEWIN: Yes, Justice Kennedy. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And those are? 19 MR. LEWIN: Those are diplomatic 20 communications. In other, it's the President who 21 makes - 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, who gets 23 the telegram or something? 24 MR. LEWIN: Well, who issues the 25 communication to the foreign government, who
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 determines -- there are certain things that the 2 President alone does because he's the one who implements 3 foreign policy. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there any treatise 5 writer or decision of this Court that supports such a 6 narrow, crabbed interpretation of the President's 7 foreign affairs power? 8 MR. LEWIN: Well, with all respect, 9 Justice Kennedy, we don't think it's crabbed. We think 10 that that is exactly what Justice Jackson was referring 11 to, and that's what this Court has said in the Medellin 12 case and -- and in Hamdan as well, that if - 13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course - 14 MR. LEWIN: Congress does not authorize - 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in part the Jackson 16 tripartite division, this famous division he had, I 17 think assumes the validity of the congressional statute 18 at the first step of inquiry. And here that's the whole 19 question. 20 MR. LEWIN: I don't know whether it's 21 limited to the assumption with regard to the 22 congressional statute. If Congress says, as it did in 23 this case, we disapprove of the State Department's view 24 that passports should not contain the -- the 25 identification of Israel for people who were born in
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Jerusalem, that is Congress disapproving of what the 2 State Department and past State Department policy has 3 been. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Lewin, you were cut 5 off earlier when you were saying this reading doesn't 6 hobble the President in the future. 7 It says anybody born in -- in Jerusalem can 8 have Israel listed, correct? What happens if there's a 9 peace accord tomorrow, and Israel gives up any claim to 10 sovereignty over Jerusalem? Is the President free to 11 stop listing Israel on the passport? 12 MR. LEWIN: If - 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or does he have to wait 14 for Congress to change the law? 15 MR. LEWIN: I think he does have to wait for 16 Congress to change the law. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, you are hobbling the 18 President with respect to situations that occur 19 frequently - 20 MR. LEWIN: Well - 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- as happened in Egypt, 22 sometimes overnight. 23 MR. LEWIN: No, but it may in some way, in a 24 very remote possible way -- I mean, I think under those 25 circumstances, if there were a peace treaty and if
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Jerusalem were handed over to a Palestinian state, I 2 think Congress would repeal the statute. 3 That's the point. Congress has the power, 4 has the authority under the Constitution to enact laws, 5 and it is Congress that makes the decision even with 6 regard to foreign policy issues. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Constitution 8 requires ambassadors to be appointed with the consent of 9 the Senate. It gives Congress the power of the purse. 10 So, why don't -- why isn't the better view that we let 11 Congress express its approval and disapproval in the 12 mechanism set up by the Constitution to do so? Meaning, 13 if the President recognizes a country that Congress 14 doesn't want it to recognize, it can withhold approval 15 of an ambassador. It could refuse to fund the embassy. 16 It could do many other things. 17 But what entitles Congress to trench on a 18 presidential power that has been exercised virtually 19 since the beginning of the country? 20 MR. LEWIN: With all respect, Justice 21 Sotomayor, I think history demonstrates that that's 22 simply not true, that in fact Congress has had equal, 23 quote, "recognition power," if in fact that's a power 24 rather than a ceremonial duty. We have in our reply 25 brief gone through the fact that from Presidents Monroe,
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Jackson, Taylor, Lincoln, and even at the time of 2 President McKinley, Congress said: We have the 3 authority to be recognized -- to recognize. 4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Lewin, this gets back to 5 the question of exactly what congressional power you're 6 basing your argument on. You started by saying you were 7 basing it on Congress's passport power, which is a 8 function of its control over immigration issues. Now 9 you're saying Congress has a co-equal recognition power. 10 Which is it, or is it both? 11 MR. LEWIN: No. It's in the alternative, 12 Justice Kagan; it is both. We submit first of all there 13 is no exclusive recognition power in the President, if 14 there is a recognition power, and we spell that out. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that go the full 16 length of saying if Congress passed a law that says the 17 United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of 18 Israel and Jerusalem must be designated as the capital 19 of Israel in all official documents -- suppose that were 20 the law. I take it, from everything you've argued, your 21 position would be, yes, Congress has that authority. 22 MR. LEWIN: We say Congress has that 23 authority, but I have to add, Justice Ginsburg, that 24 Congress has been very careful in the past and we 25 believe it will be in the future to give the President
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 broad authority. To the extent Congress has tried to do 2 that, Congress has consistently said that the President 3 can waive the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem, 4 because Congress recognizes -- this is one of these very 5 rare situations where Congress has said what the 6 President has done and what the Department of State has 7 done is simply wrong. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Lewin, you're -- it 9 seems to me you're not arguing for a co-equal 10 congressional power; you're arguing for a superior 11 congressional power. You're saying whatever Congress 12 says, the President has to comply with. Now, that's 13 quite different from saying that they both have 14 authority in the field. And if they both have authority 15 in the field and they're exercising it in different 16 fashions, I frankly would not be inclined to intervene. 17 I would let -- I would let them conduct the usual 18 inter-branch hand wrestling that goes on all the time, 19 which probably means that if Congress cares enough, 20 Congress will win because, as you say, it has an 21 innumerable number of clubs with which to beat the 22 executive. 23 But if -- if the power is a co-equal power 24 and they're both exercising it in a -- in a different 25 way, why don't we just, you know, let them go at it?

1 Why is it any of our business which is the better 2 foreign policy position? 3 MR. LEWIN: We are not -- the Court is not 4 being asked to determine what is the better foreign 5 policy position. Congress has determined and - 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Congress is supreme, then? 7 That is your position. Not -- not that Congress has 8 co-equal authority with the executive, but Congress is 9 supreme. 10 MR. LEWIN: No, there's two aspects to this, 11 Justice Scalia. One is the recognition power. As to 12 the recognition power, if it exists, Congress has it 13 together with the President. But with regard to foreign 14 policy and with regard to the question of whether 15 Congress can trump the President, this is not a new 16 proposition. The Court determined it in the Steel 17 Seizure case. The Court more recently, in -- in 18 approving Justice Jackson's tripartite scheme, approved 19 it in Medellin v. Texas. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Medellin 21 involved a situation where the President's purported 22 exercise of authority changed domestic law, and not 23 simply domestic law, but domestic State law. That seems 24 to me to be quite a distinguishable circumstance. 25 MR. LEWIN: But what -- again, what Justice
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Jackson said was that when there -- the two are 2 incompatible, then you look, the Court looks and 3 scrutinizes, "subjects to scrutiny" -- those words are 4 in Justice Jackson's standard -- scrutinizes what the 5 President has done. 6 And we submit in this case, if the Court 7 were to look at the answers to the interrogatories in 8 this case, what is the basis for the President's policy, 9 if one scrutinizes it, we say in our brief, it's -- we 10 call it trivial because what happens is the Department 11 of State has said -- and, again, this is important in 12 terms of this statute. All that happens with this 13 statute is that 50,000 American citizens have the same 14 passport as 100,000 other American citizens who were 15 born in Tel Aviv or Haifa. It just says "Israel"; it 16 doesn't say "Jerusalem, Israel"; it just says "Israel." 17 And the State Department says that's justified because 18 Arab countries or Palestinians may be upset if they 19 misperceive - 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- so, you're 21 suggesting that the outcome of this of case would be 22 different, from your perspective, if Congress said you 23 have to say "Jerusalem, Israel." 24 MR. LEWIN: I say it's a different case, 25 yes, absolutely. In this case, what -- the important
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 thing about this case and this statute is that it gives 2 the individual passport holder a choice. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is it -- why is 4 it a different case? 5 MR. LEWIN: It's a different case because if 6 it were to say "Jerusalem, Israel," there would be more 7 of an argument. Again, I'm not saying I would be here 8 acknowledging that that's impermissible. But there 9 would be more of an argument that it appears to be some 10 official approval of Jerusalem being in Israel. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, would there be 12 -- there would be a greater concern -- the concern on 13 the part of the executive that there would be adverse 14 political reaction would have a greater degree of 15 credibility? 16 MR. LEWIN: Somewhat greater degree. 17 Again - 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so, we're 19 supposed to decide whether or not the executive is 20 correct in saying that it's a significant problem. And 21 he says, well, he says that, but we know foreign policy 22 better; we don't think it's going to be a big deal. 23 MR. LEWIN: No, I don't think the Court is 24 being asked to decide a question of foreign policy. 25 Congress has decided that saying "Israel" alone does not
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 present a foreign policy issue. Congress recognized 2 that, with moving the embassy, there might be a foreign 3 policy issue. So, they said that the President can 4 waive that. 5 With regard to this provision, Congress has 6 said, no, there's not likely to be any foreign policy 7 harm. And all that the Court is being asked to do is 8 it's being asked to enforce the congressional 9 conclusion, which is, we submit, exactly what the third 10 level under Justice Jackson's test is: That if, in 11 fact, Congress decides that what the President has 12 concluded or the executive branch has concluded is 13 wrong, it may -- and it has the constitutional power to 14 say -- with regard to foreign policy, we can exercise 15 our determination. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't see Justice 17 Jackson's analysis -- what he's saying -- and I guess I 18 don't think it's as controlling as others might. He's 19 saying when there's a conflict, it's a harder case. 20 MR. LEWIN: Yes. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When there's -- when 22 they agree, it's an easy case. When you can't tell, 23 it's sort of a middle case. I don't see how that's very 24 helpful in resolving the dispute before us. 25 MR. LEWIN: Well, because he says that when
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 it's in the third category, the Court has an obligation, 2 under those circumstances if it's going to keep the 3 equilibrium of the balance of powers, to look at what 4 the President's justification is. 5 The word "scrutiny" is in there. That's not 6 simply a phrase that Justice Jackson has taken out of 7 the air. He says you're supposed to scrutinize it. And 8 if you scrutinize it in this case, there's nothing other 9 than the possibility that there would be a misperception 10 by Palestinians. That's what the State Department is 11 saying. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what were we 13 scrutinizing in the Steel Seizure case? 14 MR. LEWIN: I think in the Steel Seizure 15 case, the Court was scrutinizing whether - 16 notwithstanding the fact that Congress did not give the 17 President the power to seize steel mills, nonetheless 18 whether there could be some justification that, even in 19 -- contrary to Congress's wishes, the President would be 20 able to exercise that power. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: And what presidential power 22 would have supported that, the war power? 23 MR. LEWIN: Well, possibly the claim that as 24 Commander in Chief under -- in the time of the Korean 25 War he would be able -
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right, because he was 2 claiming that the Korean War - 3 MR. LEWIN: Entitled him - 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- required that these - 5 that these companies remain in business. And I guess we 6 did scrutinize that. What did we conclude, that that 7 was - 8 MR. LEWIN: And I think the Court concluded 9 that, no, that that did not justify the exercise of the 10 President's power even though it was - 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: But - 12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that wasn't a case - 13 that wasn't a case in which the Congress had said you 14 may not seize mills. And that's what your case is. So, 15 there's a difference. 16 MR. LEWIN: Well, but that's -- that's an a 17 fortiori situation, Justice Kennedy. If Congress didn't 18 even say you may not seize steel mills, but simply 19 because they didn't give the President affirmatively the 20 authority - 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it is if you assume 22 that the statute is valid. 23 MR. LEWIN: Well, but the statute in this 24 case -- again I come back to the fact that the statute 25 in this case is a passport statute.
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the statute is -- if 2 the statute is invalid, we're in category one. 3 MR. LEWIN: Yes, but - 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or two. 5 MR. LEWIN: But the statute in this case is 6 a -- on its face, a passport statute. There's no 7 reason - 8 JUSTICE KAGAN: But it's a passport statute 9 that - 10 MR. LEWIN: It's an identification. 11 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry. It's a passport 12 statute that seems to have nothing to do with the 13 immigration functions that passport statutes usually 14 serve. It seems to have everything to do with 15 Congress's declaration of a foreign policy, as opposed 16 to Congress's exercise of power relating to immigration 17 control. So, convince me that I am wrong on that. 18 MR. LEWIN: I think you are wrong on that, 19 Justice, and let me explain why. 20 (Laughter.) 21 MR. LEWIN: Let me explain why. Because it 22 is clear from the history of this line on the passport 23 that it is purely an identification of the individual; 24 it is not an exercise of any foreign policy. Indeed, 25 the passport statute itself says that a passport is "any
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 travel document issued by competent authority showing 2 the bearer's origin, identity, and nationality." And in 3 this case, the history of this line on the passport 4 demonstrates, I think conclusively, and the State 5 Department has acknowledged it, that it is purely a 6 means of identification. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: Are you suggesting - 8 MR. LEWIN: And what Congress has said is, 9 with regard to these citizens, we will permit them to 10 identify themselves, like Congress permitted the 11 Taiwanese to identify themselves. 12 JUSTICE ALITO: But are you suggesting 13 Congress enacted this because they thought that if these 14 individuals' passports simply said "Jerusalem," there 15 would be an identification problem? 16 MR. LEWIN: Not be -- Justice Alito, it's 17 not because there would be an identification problem. 18 But there was -- Congress recognized that with regard to 19 the 50,000 people who have a passport that says 20 "Jerusalem," they are being denied a certain sense of 21 self-respect that they feel they should be able to have 22 in terms of their own identification. 23 This is not a statute that's designed to 24 create some political brouhaha or -- or make a foreign 25 policy statement. It's a statute that, frankly, fits in
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 with what the State Department does in accommodating to 2 individual passport holders. The State Department says 3 if you're a Palestinian or an Arab and you were born in 4 Haifa and you don't like seeing "Israel" on your 5 passport, we'll allow you to eliminate "Israel" from 6 your passport. And all that Congress has said is - 7 JUSTICE KAGAN: That might be true, Mr. 8 Lewin. I think you would have a better argument if this 9 statute said if you were born in Jerusalem, you can pick 10 anything you want in your passport; you can pick 11 Jerusalem, you can pick Israel, or you can pick 12 Palestine. But the statute in fact doesn't say that. 13 It says you can pick Israel. 14 So, why isn't that a statement of foreign 15 policy as to recognition that Jerusalem is the capital 16 of Israel, as opposed to what you're characterizing it 17 as, which is a freedom of -- you know, a sort of choice 18 provision? 19 MR. LEWIN: I think that's -- what you said 20 the statute doesn't say, Justice Kagan, is exactly what 21 the statute does say. The statute does say that the 22 individual passport holder can choose to say "Israel" or 23 can keep it as "Jerusalem," and if he's born before 24 1948, he can say "Palestine." So, it is an individual 25 choice.

1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you have to be very 2 old to say "Palestine." 3 MR. LEWIN: Pardon? Pardon? 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not all that old. 5 (Laughter.) 6 MR. LEWIN: It's -- I guess it's a 7 reflection on my own seniority that - 8 (Laughter.) 9 MR. LEWIN: -- it's my generation that fits 10 into that. But -- but the fact is exactly; our point is 11 that that's all that the statute does. The statute is a 12 means of permitting self-identification by an American 13 citizen who says: My birth in Jerusalem, indeed in West 14 Jerusalem, which has always been recognized to be part 15 of Israel -- I want to call -- I want my passport to say 16 "Israel." 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's recognizing 18 that principle only with respect to a particular 19 jurisdiction. An American citizen born in Northern 20 Ireland doesn't have this option, because he thinks 21 that's part of Ireland. 22 MR. LEWIN: No, but an American citizen born 23 in Taiwan apparently does have that option, even the 24 though the United States says we don't recognize Taiwan 25 as an independent country.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And your -- and your 2 friend on behalf of the United States says that's 3 because of a State Department judgment that in one 4 situation, it's significant; in the other, it's not. 5 MR. LEWIN: Well, it's -- no, it's not just 6 because. It's because what happens is there is a 7 recognition in both cases that it is a personal 8 identification choice with regard to what goes on the 9 passport. Sure, in that case, the State Department 10 didn't take it to litigation, although I submit that had 11 they chosen to litigate that case, they would have a 12 stronger position than they have in this case. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: But a personal 14 identification choice can also have significant foreign 15 policy implications, can it not? Is -- is that an 16 either-or situation? 17 What the State Department is saying is to 18 allow this particular personal identification choice may 19 antagonize some foreign nations that we don't want to 20 antagonize. 21 What if they gave them the choice of saying 22 "Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East"? Okay? 23 That's their choice. They can have that on their 24 passport. Would that be okay? 25 MR. LEWIN: I have to say that, given this
21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Court's view about Congress's power with regard to (a) 2 passports -- and again, I go back to the fact that in 3 Zemel v. Rusk, in Haig v. Agee, in Kent v. Dulles, in 4 all these passport cases, this Court said we look to see 5 whether what the President does is authorized by 6 Congress, whether implicitly or otherwise. So that, I 7 submit, that with regard to passports, you need the 8 congressional authority, whether it's implicit or 9 express. 10 And with regard to your question, 11 Justice Scalia, yes, Congress could in an exercise of 12 its passport authority say here is what the passport has 13 to say. It would be a foolish statute. But this Court 14 has said, and I think you, Justice Scalia, have said it 15 many times, it's not the Court's job to determine 16 whether Congress is foolish or not. If Congress decides 17 that, look, somebody born in Israel, a passport should 18 say "Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East," 19 Congress can say that. Congress has passport authority. 20 And this - 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Lewin, I take it from 22 what you - 23 MR. LEWIN: -- and this has to do with the 24 contents of the passport. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What you've argued is
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that you're skipping over the question that the D.C. 2 Circuit decided. I take it your view is it's not a 3 political question; so, the Court should resolve the 4 merits. 5 MR. LEWIN: Our view is it's not a political 6 question because it is like many other questions that 7 affect foreign policy. And the Court said in Baker v. 8 Carr, not every decision that touches on foreign affairs 9 or foreign policy is a political question that can't be 10 determined. It -- it -- arguably, according to the 11 Government, this affects foreign policy. We say it is 12 simply Congress having passed a statute which either is 13 unconstitutional -- we say it is constitutional - 14 either is unconstitutional or the Court should simply 15 enforce it, like in the Japan Whaling case. 16 In the Japan Whaling case, this Court 17 rejected the claim that the outcome of a determination 18 by the Court might very well affect foreign relations, 19 and it said it's not a political question. 20 I'd like to reserve the remaining time for 21 rebuttal. Thank you. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 23 Lewin. 24 General Verrilli. 25 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 2 GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and 3 may it please the Court: 4 The executive has determined that the 5 passports it issues should not identify Israel as the 6 place of birth for persons born in Jerusalem. 7 Petitioner seeks relief under section 214(d) that would 8 countermand that executive judgment. But under the 9 Constitution, that is an exercise of the executive's 10 exclusive recognition power. The Constitution commits 11 that power exclusively to the executive, and neither a 12 court nor the Congress can override that judgment. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend - 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What of all the - 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend 16 documented contrary history at some length in his reply 17 brief, where from the beginning at least, as he says, 18 through the McKinley Administration, the two branches 19 acted as if they had co-equal authority. 20 GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, if I 21 might spend a minute or two on that history, because I 22 don't think it shows what my friend suggests that it 23 does. 24 Before getting to the starting point of that 25 story, which I think is the Monroe administration, I
24

Alderson Reporting Company

1 would like to point out that in the Washington 2 administration, the President confronted the question 3 with respect to whether to recognize the revolutionary 4 government of France. And President Washington 5 consulted with his cabinet, and, of course, his cabinet 6 included Jefferson and Madison and Hamilton and Jay. 7 And they decided that this was a power that was 8 exclusive to the President to such an extent that they 9 didn't even need to send a message to the Congress that 10 they were going to recognize the new revolutionary 11 government in France. 12 Now, the second fact that I think is 13 critical as a matter of history is that there is not a 14 single piece of legislation that has passed both houses 15 of Congress and come to the President purporting to 16 recognize a foreign nation or a territorial boundary of 17 a foreign nation. 18 JUSTICE ALITO: Has there ever been an 19 instance in which the President has recognized a foreign 20 government over Congress's sustained objection? 21 GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't -- I can't think of 22 an instance of Congress's sustained objection. I think 23 probably the closest we would come is the revolutionary 24 government of Mexico, which President Wilson first 25 recognized on a de facto basis in 1915 and a de jure

1 basis in 1917. Congress indicated displeasure with 2 that. President Wilson sent his message to Congress 3 saying that this is an exclusive executive function. 4 Congress backed down. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: What are then the reasons 6 that -- because your friend says that this is an a 7 fortiori case from everything, because all of these 8 words -- every time the word "exclusive power" has 9 appeared in any source -- I think that's what you're 10 saying -- it is meant that the President can act without 11 supporting authority from Congress. But there never has 12 been a case or a suggestion that the President can act 13 where Congress has legislated to the contrary. Now, I 14 think that's the -- that's the argument. And so, what 15 -- I would like to hear what you have to say about that 16 argument. 17 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. Yes, I will answer 18 that question directly. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh. 20 GENERAL VERRILLI: It is true that the Court 21 has never before, with respect to the recognition power, 22 confronted the question of whether the President is free 23 to act in a manner different than a congressional 24 command because Congress has never purported to issue a 25 command. That does not mean, however, that my friend is
26

1 correct that this is a situation in which Congress has 2 the authority to countermand or direct the decision of 3 the President. 4 This is, we submit -- even if one thinks 5 about this as a Youngstown category three case, this is 6 a Youngstown category three case of the kind that 7 Justice Jackson identified in footnote 4, where he cited 8 Myers v. The United States. The kind of case in 9 category three of Youngstown, in which the President's 10 judgment can prevail even over a contrary judgment of 11 Congress, is a case in which the President has exclusive 12 authority. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now - 14 GENERAL VERRILLI: And that is this case. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: But my question is, what 16 leads you to that conclusion? 17 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, let me - 18 JUSTICE BREYER: What are -- there are very, 19 very few cases I can ever think of where -- where the 20 President -- where the Court has said the President can 21 act contrary to a statute. And so, the point of my 22 question was to get you to talk about - 23 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: -- why, even though this is 25 a fortiori.

1 GENERAL VERRILLI: So, I do think, if I 2 could -- I think it would be helpful in answering your 3 question, Justice Breyer, if I could return to the Chief 4 Justice's question about history. Moving beyond that 5 initial recognition by Washington that this is an 6 exclusive power, which I think is quite significant, 7 when we get to the Monroe administration, there is a 8 fight between Clay and Monroe about whether the 9 President has exclusive authority to recognize the new 10 South American republics. 11 Now, a couple of points there. I think the 12 -- what -- the only thing that one could point to as an 13 action by the Congress that even implicates the 14 recognition power is one house of Congress passed an 15 appropriations measure for an ambassador. What the - 16 the history treatise, the Goebel treatise that my friend 17 cites, says on page 133, the very page that he cites in 18 his reply brief, is that Clay's effort to contest the 19 President's exclusive authority came to a, quote, 20 "inglorious end," unquote. 21 He then goes on to say -- my friend goes on 22 to say, well, but a year later when President Monroe 23 sought to actually recognize these South American 24 republics, he asked -- he asked the Congress to join him 25 in it. What he asked Congress for was an appropriation
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 for an ambassador. But it was not the sending of an 2 ambassador to the Republic of Colombia that was the 3 recognition. It was when President Monroe received an 4 ambassador from Colombia that constituted the 5 recognition, and that was an exclusive act that he 6 undertook without any consultation with Congress. 7 Now - 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The two examples that are 9 given in the brief, one of Texas, where Petitioner says 10 there was a case where Congress went first -- Congress 11 recognized and the President acquiesced, and the same 12 thing with Taiwan; it was a statute and the President 13 implemented it. So, if the -- Congress thought it had 14 the authority, the recognition authority, in those two 15 measures, and the President acquiesced. 16 GENERAL VERRILLI: I'd like to address Texas 17 because I do think that's probably the most significant 18 example that my friend's identified. But even there, I 19 think if one works through the history, we'll see that 20 it's an exclusive executive power. 21 President Jackson, in his first letter in 22 1836 to the Congress, says essentially: I hear you; you 23 think we should recognize Texas. And then he says: 24 It's an open question as far as I am concerned whether 25 there's exclusive authority or not. It's not been
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 something that the legislature has ever studied, but as 2 a matter of expediency, he says, we don't need to 3 resolve that question, because I want to work with you. 4 He then goes on to caution the Congress to not move too 5 quickly for fear of precipitating war with Mexico, which 6 I think, Justice Breyer, I'll try to return to a 7 functional analysis later, and that's, I think, an 8 important point. 9 What -- then -- but I think what's 10 important, Justice Ginsburg, is that what Congress did 11 next was to pass two appropriations measures, one in the 12 House, one in the Senate. Each of those measures 13 appropriates funds for an emissary to the Republic of 14 Texas, but each includes language that says: At such 15 time that the President determines that it's appropriate 16 to do so. 17 If one looks at the page in the 18 Congressional Globe that my friend cites, one will see 19 that that language was added because, as originally 20 introduced, the appropriations riders were objected to 21 by members of Congress on the ground that they infringed 22 on the President's exclusive recognition authority. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if I could 24 stop you and just have you address the political 25 question doctrine.

1 GENERAL VERRILLI: Sure. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say this is 3 exclusively committed to the President, and, therefore, 4 it is a non-justiciable political question. How is that 5 different from saying it's our job to decide cases, it 6 is justiciable, and then you can argue that the answer 7 of that analysis is that it's exclusively committed to 8 the President? I don't understand why labeling it a 9 political question advances the analysis much. 10 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think we agree, 11 Mr. Chief Justice, that there isn't a very great deal 12 of difference. We acknowledge that in conducting the 13 political question analysis, that it is for the Court to 14 decide whether there's a textual commitment to the 15 executive; it is for the Court to decide the scope. We 16 think that's what Nixon v. United States says; it's what 17 Powell v. McCormack says; and that in answering those 18 questions, we think that the Court will have gone a very 19 long way to determining the question of the - 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not all the way? I 21 mean, if the Court decides that the Constitution commits 22 this authority exclusively to the President, then it's 23 all over. That's the merits of the case: Does the 24 President have this authority? So, the political 25 question label seems to be kind of a -- a subterfuge
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 because if there is a textual commission -- commitment 2 to the President, that's the end of the case. 3 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, the -- I do think 4 that with respect to the first Baker v. Carr factor, 5 textual commitment is a factor that the Court has 6 indicated is one that can lead to the conclusion that 7 it's a political question. 8 I do think that the Court has to go through 9 the analysis. And so, at the end of the day, there may 10 not be very much of a difference --  11 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, doesn't it depend on 12 what the question is? In order to decide whether it's a 13 political question, you have to identify the question. 14 Now, if the question is whether the President has 15 exclusive authority with respect to the formal 16 recognition of a foreign country, that might be one 17 thing. But what if the question is whether the 18 President has exclusive jurisdiction with respect -- has 19 plenary authority, unreviewable authority, with respect 20 to anything that the President thinks has a bearing on 21 the question of recognition. 22 Now, if that's the question, is that 23 committed exclusively to the President? 24 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, Justice Alito, we 25 don't -- we think Powell v. McCormack and Nixon say
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that the question of -- not just the question of 2 commitment, but also the question of scope, are questions 3 for the Court to decide. 4 And we do think, with respect to the 5 question here, that even though it's for the Court to 6 decide, it's for the Court to decide with a very 7 significant measure of deference, because when -- the 8 decision by the executive with respect to how it's going 9 to handle the status of Jerusalem in passports is a very 10 sensitive and delicate matter. This position was 11 arrived at after very careful thought, and it is 12 enforced very carefully. And I think from that should 13 come the lesson that this -- and the reason is because 14 the executive believes that the statement on the 15 passport has to be understood as a manifestation of the 16 President's exercise of the recognition power. 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose this, General 18 Verrilli: Suppose that this statute -- there was the 19 section that's there now, and then there was another 20 section, and the section said: The recording of Israel 21 as a place of birth on a passport shall not constitute 22 recognition of Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem. 23 Would that be constitutional? 24 GENERAL VERRILLI: I -- I don't think it 25 would change the analysis, Justice Kagan. I -- I think
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 -- of course, that is not this statute, which has a title 2 which says "United States Policy With Respect to 3 Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel." But - 4 JUSTICE KAGAN: No, my statute has a title 5 which says "Identification of Persons Born in 6 Jerusalem." 7 GENERAL VERRILLI: I still -- I still think 8 that would be within the scope of the executive's power 9 to decide because the content of the passport, insofar 10 as the Executive believes that it constitutes an 11 expression of -- of an incident of recognition, is a 12 judgment that the executive makes. 13 Now, the Court can review that, but the 14 Court's review of it should be done with a significant 15 measure of deference as the Court suggested in Regan v. 16 Wald. Now - 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, what is - 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That seems to me different 19 than the rationale of the D.C. Circuit. It seems to me 20 you're not defending the rationale of the D.C. 21 Circuit - 22 GENERAL VERRILLI: No - 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that there's no 24 jurisdiction. 25 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, we -

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And, you know, it's - 2 it's always awkward for us to tell counsel what's in 3 their best interest, but - 4 (Laughter.) 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it does -- it does 6 seem to me that your position would be much stronger if 7 you said there is jurisdiction, and the President wins. 8 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, we think -- we do 9 think that if there is jurisdiction, the President wins. 10 But we do think that the D.C. Circuit acted 11 appropriately in finding that - 12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because if this -- if this 13 rationale remains the law and is the law, then you have 14 the specter of constant legislative determinations that 15 are not clearly -- not clearly invalid. And it seems to 16 me that's, again with all due respect, not in the best 17 interest of the ultimate argument you're making. 18 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, we appreciate that, 19 Justice Kennedy. We do think that in resolving a 20 political question -- in conducting a political question 21 analysis, the questions that the Court would need to 22 decide under Nixon and Powell would go a very long way 23 to clarifying that problem. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if - 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General -

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if Congress's 2 statute said what you must put on the passport, if 3 requested, is "Israel," parentheses, ("Disputed"), close 4 parentheses? Which would seem to take care of your 5 objection that people are going to look at this and draw 6 a false conclusion. 7 GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't think that changes 8 the analysis, Mr. Chief Justice, because I think that 9 that -- the -- to the -- because it would -- that would 10 be again Congress seeking to direct a judgment of the - 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is the position 12 of the administration, isn't it, that the status of 13 Jerusalem is disputed? 14 GENERAL VERRILLI: That's correct, Mr. Chief 15 Justice, but it -- what the United States says about 16 that in official communications -- and remember, a 17 passport is not a communication by the passport holder. 18 It's an official United States document that 19 communicates the position of the United States. 20 That's - 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what if Congress 22 says, in the place that you have it, this person has the 23 choice of whether or not to put "Jerusalem" or "Israel"? 24 This doesn't affect whether the United States recognizes 25 Jerusalem as part of Israel or not; it's just his

1 choice. Same problem? 2 GENERAL VERRILLI: Same problem, Mr. Chief 3 Justice. This is - 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Really? 5 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 7 argument was that someone's going to look at that and 8 say that -- that offends me, that you're calling this 9 part of Israel. That was the foreign policy 10 significance. And I tried to give you a hypothetical in 11 which nobody could reasonably draw that conclusion, and 12 you say still, same thing. 13 GENERAL VERRILLI: I do think that this is an 14 area in which the executive's got to make the judgment 15 because it's of paramount importance that the nation 16 speak with one voice. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then -- General Verrilli, 18 then you are taking the position that this is not a 19 shared authority; it's an exclusive authority, that 20 there is no role for Congress. Am I right? Or is there 21 some role in recognition for -- for Congress? 22 GENERAL VERRILLI: Our position, Justice 23 Ginsburg, is that the recognition power is exclusive to 24 the President. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if the

1 recognition of a breakaway province of a foreign country 2 by the United States will clearly provoke a war with 3 that country. Would Congress have the power to decree 4 that the President shall not recognize that breakaway 5 province, knowing -- knowing that if he does recognize 6 it, that country will declare war on the United States? 7 GENERAL VERRILLI: I think, Justice Scalia, 8 that's a situation in which the President would exercise 9 that recognition power very carefully - 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no. We have a foolish 11 President. 12 (Laughter.) 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Contrary to our entire 14 history, we have a - 15 (Laughter.) 16 GENERAL VERRILLI: I think -- although I 17 don't -- I just don't think that in a situation like 18 that, the President would exercise a recognition power, 19 but if -- but if the President did, it's the President's 20 judgment to make. 21 And I -- Justice Breyer, if I could get back 22 to your question, in addition to the - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Please stay on this. 24 GENERAL VERRILLI: I'm sorry. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I am -- I am willing -

1 (Laughter.) 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Our cases say repeatedly 3 that the President is the sole instrument of the United 4 States for the conduct of foreign policy, but to be the 5 sole instrument and to determine the foreign policy are 6 two quite different things. To say he's the sole 7 instrument simply means that congressmen traveling 8 abroad or globetrotting ex-presidents -- nobody except 9 the President of the United States pronounces the 10 foreign policy. But it doesn't necessarily mean that 11 the President determines everything in foreign policy. 12 He's the instrument, but there is certainly 13 room in those many cases for saying that Congress can 14 say what the -- what it's -- what the country's 15 instrument is supposed to do. 16 GENERAL VERRILLI: I -- I think with respect to 17 the question of recognition, Justice Scalia, that it is 18 a power that rests with the executive. And I think in 19 addition to the history, in that we do -- now in 20 220-plus years in our Constitution, do not have a single 21 example of Congress actually exercising the power, and I 22 think in addition to the history, there are very good 23 functional reasons why that is so. 24 And I think, Justice Breyer -- in answering 25 your earlier question, I think those are significant.

1 The exercise of the recognition power depends, we think, 2 on three things that make it clear that it needs to be 3 exclusive. The first is timing; the second is 4 expertise; and the third is a need for secrecy. 5 Timing - 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't hear the third. 7 GENERAL VERRILLI: The need for secrecy. 8 Timing is -- I think the Israel example 9 shows, is of critical importance. But it's not just 10 speed. Of course, Congress can't act with the dispatch 11 needed in a situation like the recognition of Israel. 12 But the -- but apart from that, recognition -- a 13 recognition that occurs too soon could send events in a 14 direction that could be very disadvantageous to our 15 foreign policy. A recognition that comes too late 16 could -- could squander an important opportunity in the 17 national interest in the foreign policy realm. 18 JUSTICE KAGAN: General Verrilli, is the 19 textual basis for your argument that the President has 20 exclusive power here? Is it the Receipt of Ambassadors 21 Clause alone, or is it something else? Because I was 22 frankly a little bit surprised that your brief put so 23 much weight on that Receipt of Ambassadors Clause, which 24 arguably was meant to give the President a purely 25 ministerial function and so little weight on any other
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 power that the President has. 2 GENERAL VERRILLI: So -- here's our position on 3 that, Justice Kagan: We do think that the Reception 4 Clause is the source of the recognition power. Hamilton 5 identified it as the source of the recognition power in 6 the Washington administration. I think it's now 7 understood that it's hornbook law that that's the 8 textual source, but to the extent that - 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's the best there 10 is. 11 GENERAL VERRILLI: But - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if you've got to 13 cast about for something, I suppose -- I don't know what 14 else you'd -- you'd land upon. 15 GENERAL VERRILLI: It is there. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it is there. It 17 doesn't say a whole lot. 18 GENERAL VERRILLI: And in addition -- I would 19 say in addition, to the extent there is a question, we 20 do think, as I think we indicated in our brief, that - 21 that one can see this power as part of what the Court in 22 Garamendi described as the vast share of responsibility 23 that the Constitution assigns to the executive. Now, we 24 don't think all of that shared responsibility is 25 exclusive to the executive, but we think this
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 responsibility is exclusive. 2 JUSTICE KAGAN: So, if that provision were 3 not in the Constitution, would you be making the same 4 argument you are now? 5 GENERAL VERRILLI: If the Reception Clause 6 were not in the Constitution, but we had the same history 7 that we have now and the same functional considerations 8 about the need for it being in the control of the 9 executive, yes, we would. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: There are many things that 11 Congress could do to frustrate the President's decision 12 to recognize another country. Now, would you say all of 13 those are unconstitutional? They all infringe the 14 President's exclusive recognition authority? 15 Suppose the President decides to recognize a 16 country, and Congress refuses to appropriate any money 17 for an embassy there or refuses to confirm any U.S. 18 ambassador to that country. Those presumably would not 19 be unconstitutional, would they? 20 GENERAL VERRILLI: The -- I think that there 21 would be a difference between -- I -- I think that - 22 that Congress has authority over appropriations. 23 Congress has authority to appoint ambassadors. It's 24 entitled to exercise that authority, and it's entitled 25 to exercise that authority even if it's in tension with
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the President's recognition decision. 2 It is the position of the executive, though, 3 that there could be circumstances in which Congress 4 could try to exercise its appropriations authority in a 5 way that would preclude the executive from exercising 6 its -- its recognition power, and that -- the executive 7 would in some circumstances believe that it had the 8 authority to move ahead despite those actions by 9 Congress. 10 But, of course, this is not a situation in 11 which Congress has passed a sense of the Congress 12 resolution about what it thinks. It's not a situation 13 in which Congress has exercised attaching conditions to 14 its spending power about what private parties do. This 15 is an effort by Congress to regulate the content of a 16 passport, which, as the Court recognized in Haig v. 17 Agee, is a core instrument of diplomatic communication. 18 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that's an 19 exclusive power, to -- to determine of the contents of 20 passports? Hasn't Congress exercised that authority - 21 GENERAL VERRILLI: We - 22 JUSTICE ALITO: -- for a long time. 23 GENERAL VERRILLI: We don't think that the 24 entire content of passports is an exclusive power. I 25 would -- and I'll explain, Justice Alito, where we think
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the line is. But before doing so, I do want to push 2 back a little bit on the notion that Congress has for a 3 long time exercised authority over the content of 4 passports. 5 The first Passport Act was in 1856. What 6 this Court said in Haig v. Agee was that the enactment 7 of that statute merely confirmed a power that everyone 8 understood to be inherent in the executive. That 9 statute did not purport to regulate the content of 10 passports. It, in fact, said that passports shall be 11 issued under such rules as the President shall 12 proscribe. And -- and in Haig, that was that language, 13 I think, that led the Court to conclude that this was a 14 confirmation of the executive's authority and an action 15 in aid of that authority. Now - 16 JUSTICE BREYER: I just want -- I don't want 17 the time to elapse. You can finish that if you'd like. 18 I'd just like somewhere a few words about the political 19 question, which you don't believe in. From reading your 20 brief, I would say you don't believe in it much. And my 21 question on the political question for either of you is 22 this: that -- that this is an area of foreign affairs. 23 It's an area of -- of, you know, recognition. We know 24 that. Never has this Court or anyone else held that 25 Congress can go ahead in this area over a law passed by
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Congress. But it is passports, which both regulate. 2 And our real problem is these are words that are 3 officially said and they are detailed words, and those 4 words may really disrupt coherent foreign policy. 5 Viewed that way, there are billions of words that might 6 have the same effect. And do we know that these words 7 will and some other words won't? No, judges don't know 8 that. 9 And, therefore, when you get into this area, 10 the best thing to do is avoid multifarious 11 pronouncements by various departments of government on 12 one question; do not respect the views of other 13 branches; and, judges, stay out of it. Let them work it 14 out by themselves. 15 I just want a word from either you and 16 really Mr. Lewin on -- on that. 17 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. Well, we do think - 18 that's what -- we think that the appropriate inquiry for 19 political question purposes is into the relief that the 20 Petitioner is seeking and if the relief the Petitioner 21 is seeking would invade the kinds of judgments that the 22 Constitution commits exclusively to the executive. And 23 the reason it commits these kinds of judgments 24 exclusively to the executive is because this is a 25 situation in which multifarious voices are inimical to
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the national interest. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that is still - 3 that's a merits determination. The whole question is, 4 who has the authority? And whatever label you put on 5 it, if you decide that the President has, as you just 6 said, the exclusive authority, that's the end of the 7 matter. It -- it's not leaving it -- it is not leaving 8 it, as Justice Breyer said, to the political branches to 9 fight it out between them. It is saying the President 10 has the exclusive authority. 11 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I -- I think in - 12 in -- let me try to put it this way, Justice Ginsburg: 13 In the absence of section 214, I think it would be clear 14 from Pink and Belmont that this -- that the judgment on 15 recognition is exclusively committed to the executive, 16 and it would be a political question, if a party came in 17 and said I want my passport to say something different 18 about Jerusalem than it says, that - 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, the tension 20 that I see here, and I think it's what Justice Breyer 21 is getting at, is the label's important, because if we 22 call this a political question and don't address the 23 merits, the outcome is that the President is saying that 24 he's entitled to ignore the Congress. I don't know what 25 kind of message that sends, but it's a little unsettling
46

Alderson Reporting Company

1 that a Court charged with enforcing the laws passed by 2 Congress are basically saying we're not going to 3 determine whether this law is constitutional or 4 unconstitutional.

And where does that 6 stop? 7 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I - 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In what situations? 9 Only in foreign policy do we decide not to - 10 GENERAL VERRILLI: I think, Justice Sotomayor, 11 it's actually quite narrow, and the problem isn't a 12 significant one in the case of textual commitment, 13 because the Court does -- in reaching the conclusion, as 14 the D.C. Circuit did, that it's a political question, 15 the Court does have to decide whether there is a textual 16 commitment to the executive here. So, the Court would 17 resolve that question. The Court would resolve the 18 question of whether the conduct at issue here is within 19 the scope of that textual commitment. So, the Court 20 would issue those rulings. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what you told - 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's not what the 23 D.C.

It would 6 be -- it would be a commitment that one would read as 7 the historical gloss on the vesting power, which is what 8 Garamendi said. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That sounds to me 10 like not in the text. 11 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think it's the 12 historical gloss on the vesting power. It is -- it 13 functions as the equivalent of the specific textual 14 commitment. Of course, we do have the specific textual 15 commitment here, the - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: This textual commitment 17 applies when somebody comes to the Court and asks for 18 the Court to make the decision. If the plaintiff here 19 had come in and -- without a congressional statute to 20 rely upon, and had said, it is -- it is wrong for the 21 State Department not to let me say "Israel" on my 22 passport, then we would say, you know, textually 23 committed to the executive. 24 But this is a different situation where you 25 have a -- a dispute between the two branches, and where
48

1 that happens, I find it hard to say, well, you know, we 2 can't get into it because why? Because it's textually 3 committed to one of the branches? It seems to me we 4 have to resolve that question. 5 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, as I said earlier 6 or I tried to say, we think that the -- the analysis 7 under the political question doctrine goes a very long 8 way towards answering that question, Justice Scalia. We 9 do think that this could be seen as a case like Gilligan, 10 in which looking at the relief that the petitioner is 11 seeking, the plaintiff is seeking, leads the Court to 12 conclude that this -- that -- that entertaining the 13 claim would embroil the Court in decisions that are 14 supposed to be made by another branch; and that, in 15 fact, I think you can understand section 214(d) as 16 precisely that, an effort to try to draw the Court into 17 this dispute between Congress and the executive over 18 whether section -- over whether Jerusalem should be 19 recognized as part of Israel. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I will give you a 21 couple more minutes. If my colleagues have any 22 questions? 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I -- I wanted to 24 follow up on that. Does -- does that mean you're 25 content to have this Court not say whether it's the
49

1 exclusive executive power or -- or there's some 2 congressional participation? I mean, if we just 3 abstain, if we just say it's none of our business, it's 4 none of our business; let you two guys fight it out - 5 that's not what you're asking us to do, is it? 6 GENERAL VERRILLI: That's correct, Justice 7 Scalia. It's not what we're asking - 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're asking us to decide 9 the question that it is exclusively the presidential 10 power. 11 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. That is correct. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't sound to me 13 like -- you know, like abstaining because it's a 14 political question. It seems to me like deciding the 15 case. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you want to 17 answer? 18 GENERAL VERRILLI: We -- we do think that 19 the -- whether the Court is looking at it as a political 20 question or whether the Court is looking at it as a 21 judgment of the merits, the issue is textual commitment. 22 This is -- there is textual commitment. This is a 23 situation in which the country has to speak with one 24 voice, and the executive has determined what the country 25 should say.

1 Thank you. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 3 Mr. Lewin, we'll give you 6 minutes. 4 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN 5 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 6 MR. LEWIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 7 Let me begin my rebuttal by echoing really 8 what Justice Alito said during my colleague's argument. 9 The question is whether anything that the President 10 thinks bears on recognition, it forecloses this Court or 11 any court from making that determination? 12 This is not in our view a recognition case. 13 This is a passport case. The question is, what goes on 14 the passport, and may somebody self-identify? This 15 is -- again, if one looks at the statute, if one even 16 looks at the Foreign Affairs Manual, a passport is not 17 today considered a diplomatic statement; it's an 18 identification of a person in order to enable him to 19 travel abroad. 20 Now, again, let me also echo what the Chief 21 Justice and Justice Kagan asked during my colleague's 22 argument. If in fact the statute had said we don't say 23 Jerusalem is part of Israel, but you can identify 24 yourself as being in Israel, my -- we submit that result 25 can very easily be achieved and was achieved in the case
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 of Taiwan by a public statement by the executive. 2 Congress -- this law can be enacted. People 3 who were born in Jerusalem can have their passport say 4 either "Jerusalem" or "Israel." That's their choice. 5 Congress hasn't said it has to say "Israel." And then 6 the Department of State can issue, as it did in the case 7 of Taiwan, a public statement saying this is not 8 official American policy. 9 Nobody's asking this Court to decide what is 10 official American policy. Nobody is asking the Court to 11 decide what, as Justice Scalia said, would happen if 12 there were no congressional statute. In that case, it 13 would be a political question. 14 If my client had decided he wanted to have 15 his passport say "Israel" and he had no congressional 16 statute, and we brought the case to a court, the court 17 could say, no, you're asking us to decide what the 18 President should decide, what the Department of State 19 should decide. 20 But other than that, Congress has enacted 21 the law. The -- the fact is that with regard to this 22 legislation, it is a statute which determines personal 23 choice with regard to a passport. The case can be a 24 vehicle -- this case can be a vehicle for an 25 authoritative clarification of the roles of Congress and
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the President in conducting the nation's foreign 2 affairs. If so, then we submit Justice Jackson's 3 statement, which acknowledges that Congress has the 4 final word in the third category, is one that should 5 control. But there are narrower grounds for enforcing 6 section 214(d) that do not implicate separation of 7 powers issues. 8 It's a passport law. It's within Congress's 9 constitutional authority on the cases that have 10 recognized that the President may not deny or restrict 11 passports without the express or implied approval of 12 Congress. That doesn't require the recognition or 13 involve the recognition of foreign sovereigns. 14 And the State Department's justification for 15 a policy that Congress has disapproved does not 16 withstand scrutiny. The Court merely has to look at the 17 record in this case in which the State Department has 18 said, look, we're concerned that there may be a 19 misperception of what this means. A misperception. 20 And it's extraordinary that on the basis of 21 the fact that there's an alleged misperception, American 22 citizens who have been authorized by Congress to say - 23 identify themselves on their passports as being born in 24 Israel will now find that statute nullified. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me -
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 let's assume that a dozen nations said this designation 2 on the passport is -- we view as an act of war; if the 3 United States is going to do this, we're going to view 4 it as an act of war. Would that then permit the 5 President to ignore Congress's statute - 6 MR. LEWIN: I think Congress has to weigh 7 that; and if Congress determines that in any event this 8 is what the passport should say, then that is 9 Congress - 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, it's not the 11 misperception that's at issue. 12 MR. LEWIN: Well, in this case - 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That misperception has 14 nothing to do with your argument. 15 MR. LEWIN: I -- I don't think that's true 16 because - 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're going back to 18 Justice Scalia's point, which is what you're saying is 19 Congress dictates foreign policy in the end. 20 MR. LEWIN: In the end, if Congress 21 determines that what the President has said in this 22 context is wrong, yes. We live in a system under which 23 Congress passes the law, and the President has the 24 duty -- and I think Justice Scalia has said it, has the 25 duty to be the sole instrument of foreign policy. The
54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 President speaks for the foreign policy that -- when 2 Congress authorizes him to do it, he may formulate it. 3 When Congress does not authorize him to do it, he may 4 formulate it. But when Congress disapproves of what he 5 does, then under Justice Jackson's test in the Steel 6 Seizure case, Congress prevails. 7 The fact that there is dictum in cases - 8 particularly Curtiss-Wright, which has not come up in 9 the course of the argument, but Justice Sutherland's 10 opinion in the Curtiss-Wright case in which he spoke 11 broadly of the President as being the sole organ of 12 foreign policy -- one has to say that the Harvard 13 professor Thomas Reed Powell, who used to tell his 14 students that just because Mr. -- Justice Sutherland 15 writes clearly, you must not suppose that he thinks 16 clearly. 17 (Laughter.) 18 MR. LEWIN: And we submit that is really 19 what it is all about. 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have just -- I have just 21 one question on -- on Washington's recognition of 22 revolutionary France. You cite in the reply brief the 23 fact that the administration was simply following what 24 it deemed to be a dictate of international law. Do you 25 want us to infer from that that he was not exercising a
55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 real discretion there? 2 MR. LEWIN: Correct. The -- historians 3 who've studied that have determined that he was just 4 following Mr. Vattel, who said you had have to recognize 5 any country that has de facto control; and, therefore, 6 since the French revolutionists were in de facto control 7 of the French Government, Washington had no choice. He 8 was not exercising any kind of discretion. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 10 MR. LEWIN: Thank you. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is 12 submitted. 13 (Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the 14 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
