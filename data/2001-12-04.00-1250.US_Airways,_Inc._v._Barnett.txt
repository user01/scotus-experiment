 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 next in Number 00-1250, U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Robert
 5 Barnett.
 6 Mr. Dellinger.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER, III
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 9 MR. DELLINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 10 please the Court:
 11 Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act
 12 does more than merely prohibit hostile discrimination
 13 against individuals with disabilities. Congress
 14 recognized that an additional kind of discrimination is
 15 the failure of employers through indifference or whatever
 16 to undertake reasonable accommodations to the physical or
 17 mental limitations of otherwise qualified individuals. As
 18 a result, this act does affirmatively require businesses
 19 to lift barriers that inhibit employment opportunities for
 20 those with disabilities.
 21 The question here, though, is whether, in one
 22 particular respect, the act goes beyond a requirement that
 23 obstacles be cleared away. The issue is this. Where an
 24 employee is unable, because of a disability, to continue
 25 in his job, is that employee entitled to be placed in

3 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 another position instead of a more senior fellow employee
 2 who would be entitled to the job under the normal
 3 operation of a bona fide seniority system?
 4 Now, this is not an easy question, but we
 5 believe that in the end a clear answer necessarily emerges
 6 from the act, and that is this, that the act simply does
 7 not require an employer to override neutral selection
 8 criteria wholly unrelated to disability in choosing among
 9 applicants for a position, and in particular it does not
 10 require the employer to set aside the normal operation of
 11 a bona fide seniority system.
 12 QUESTION: Mr. Dellinger, are you suggesting by
 13 that argument that the express exception for bona fide
 14 seniority systems in title VII was surplusage, that it
 15 wasn't needed, because there would have been -- it would
 16 have been counted as a neutral rule?
 17 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. In fact, I
 18 think the presence of that provision in title VII is part
 19 of a background assumption in which neither title VII nor
 20 any other Civil Rights Act has ever taken what would be a
 21 fairly substantial step of requiring an employer to prefer
 22 someone for a position over an employee who is entitled to
 23 it under a seniority system or, indeed, to prefer any
 24 applicant over a more qualified employee.
 25 QUESTION: But your answer is that it wasn't

4 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 necessary to put that in title VII, title VII would apply
 2 just the same way without it?
 3 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. I do not
 4 believe that --
 5 QUESTION: Is there any indication that that's
 6 what Congress thought when it didn't -- I mean, it does
 7 seem a rather conspicuous absence, that the model statute,
 8 the basic one has an express exception for bona fide
 9 seniority systems, and this one doesn't.
 10 MR. DELLINGER: Title VII took especial care to
 11 do that, but if you look at the more relevant statute, the
 12 Rehabilitation Act, it also does not contain any express
 13 exception and, moreover, it was interpreted not to require
 14 that, but most importantly under title VII, is this
 15 Court's decision in TWA v. Hardison, where the Court said
 16 it would reach the same result as the principle we argue
 17 for here, even without, even before you get to the portion
 18 of the act about bona fide seniority systems.
 19 The Court in Hardison held that the reasonable
 20 accommodation language of that act for religious
 21 adherence, the same reasonable accommodation undue
 22 hardship language does not require displacing the rights
 23 of more senior employees under a seniority system in order
 24 to accommodate a religious adherence need to avoid working
 25 on a Saturday shift.

5 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: But are there any instances in which
 2 the seniority clause has to be ignored in favor of a
 3 reasonable accommodation? Suppose there are two positions
 4 and they pay the same thing, but a senior employee wants
 5 position A, and that's the only one that the disabled
 6 person can fulfill? The seniority provision trumps there?
 7 MR. DELLINGER: Yes, it does, Justice Kennedy,
 8 and let me acknowledge that, of course, whenever you have
 9 a clear rule like the rule here that an employee, that an
 10 employer may apply a neutral standard unrelated to
 11 disability, such as a merit standard or a seniority
 12 standard, any time you have a clear rule, and that's the
 13 way seniority systems operate, you're going to have
 14 individual cases where, if you had a different kind of
 15 system involving individual assessment, you might reach a
 16 different conclusion in the very particular instances, but
 17 that -- that notion that you look and see whether in one
 18 particular case favoring the interest of the less-senior
 19 employee would in some social sense be better, that system
 20 is fundamentally incompatible with the nature of how a
 21 seniority system operates.
 22 This is a system that, for US Airways, there are
 23 14,000 customer service employees. Seniority is a system
 24 that gets rid of the potential of favoritism --
 25 QUESTION: Would you talk about what the system

6 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 is here, because I found it a little hard to understand. 
 2 Is it that a policy of the employer, the airline, that
 3 every so often all positions in the category in which this
 4 person worked are declared vacant?
 5 MR. DELLINGER: I think that terminology is not
 6 used, Justice O'Connor. The effect may be the same. What
 7 happens under US Airways' system is that periodically,
 8 basically once a quarter, all positions are put up for
 9 rebidding.
 10 QUESTION: All positions throughout the company,
 11 or in certain categories of jobs?
 12 MR. DELLINGER: All through the entire category
 13 of customer service employees, which would be 14,000. I
 14 don't think they rebuild the --
 15 QUESTION: Customer service jobs, once a
 16 quarter, are all declared open?
 17 MR. DELLINGER: That's right. Each different
 18 division would -- well, they're not so much declared open,
 19 as simply put up for rebidding. That is, the way the
 20 system operates is that there is a -- it's a very simple
 21 system. There's a list kept in order of seniority. 
 22 Everybody can rely upon where they are in the pecking
 23 order of that list. When there are positions eliminated,
 24 the people who are in those positions are not necessarily
 25 the ones who lose their job.

7 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 If two positions are eliminated in the freight
 2 area, the two juniormost employees have to leave, and
 3 the --
 4 QUESTION: Well, we're not talking about job
 5 elimination. I thought we were talking about an existing
 6 job that continues but it's declared open.
 7 MR. DELLINGER: No. There is no -- there's
 8 no -- if you gained the impression from respondent's brief
 9 that Mr. Barnett's position was somehow singled out to be
 10 declared vacant --
 11 QUESTION: No. No, all customer service jobs,
 12 every quarter, are essentially declared open. Is that the
 13 policy?
 14 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. That is
 15 correct.
 16 QUESTION: And at that -- is it also true, as I
 17 think you allege, that the seniority policy does not
 18 create legally enforceable rights in any employee? No
 19 employee wanting to come in would be able to sue to get
 20 that enforced.
 21 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. The
 22 company's --
 23 QUESTION: So what kind of a seniority plan is
 24 that? I mean, on the one hand you say, we have to apply
 25 our seniority plan, but on the other hand, it isn't

8 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 enforceable.
 2 MR. DELLINGER: Yes, and I'm glad you asked
 3 that. Of course, the company's consistent position in
 4 court, whenever someone wants to have a court review how a
 5 seniority plan is applied, is it relies upon the fact that
 6 it does not create legal rights enforceable in court, but
 7 no one has challenged the fact that it is a bona fide
 8 program. It's not a --
 9 QUESTION: I know, but what would be the
 10 situation if there were truly a vacant position at US
 11 Airways in customer service? Would you think the ADA
 12 would say that it would be a reasonable accommodation to
 13 consider a disabled employee for placement in one of those
 14 slots?
 15 MR. DELLINGER: Yes, absolutely. We believe
 16 that the reassignment aspect of reasonable accommodation
 17 does have considerable bite and does considerable work. 
 18 It requires you not only to consider, but actively
 19 consider whether there are any other vacant places in
 20 which you could place an employee.
 21 QUESTION: I mean, there is a provision in the
 22 act itself, is there not, that speaks to a vacancy and
 23 that can be a reasonable accommodation?
 24 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct, and we believe
 25 that what that means, Justice O'Connor, is that an

9 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 employer must, unlike the situation under the
 2 Rehabilitation Act, where you could simply say you can't
 3 do the job --
 4 QUESTION: Yes.
 5 MR. DELLINGER: -- we're letting you go, we
 6 can't accommodate that job, they have no obligation to
 7 consider other places in the company.
 8 Here, they have to actively consider. You have
 9 to actually go out, you're obligated to go out and try to
 10 find a vacant position.
 11 QUESTION: Okay, so why isn't the sort of thing
 12 that US Airways does here, declaring all these jobs open
 13 once a quarter, create the kind of thing that US Airways
 14 has to consider a vacant position?
 15 MR. DELLINGER: Well, you are exactly right that
 16 when the quarterly rebidding process comes up, yes, they
 17 have to consider, and they did, indeed, consider Mr.
 18 Barnett's request to be transferred into that position. 
 19 Moreover, if they needed to make adjustment or
 20 accommodations on how that second position functioned,
 21 they would be obligated to do that as well.
 22 What they were not obligated to do at this
 23 point, after they've identified available positions,
 24 overridden any arbitrary rules that say, you know, some
 25 people can't have that position, altered the position,

10 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 they then consider whether there's any good reason not to
 2 place Mr. Barnett in that position and, in the absence of
 3 a good reason, they are required by this provision to do
 4 so. At this point, we believe that the better reading of
 5 the act does not require the employer to override neutral
 6 selection criteria wholly unrelated to disability in
 7 choosing among applicants --
 8 QUESTION: May I ask, do you mean any neutral --
 9 any neutral selection criteria would trump the statute? 
 10 Say they had a criteria that they used brand new employees
 11 for certain ticket-selling jobs as a training mechanism,
 12 and they always took people who hadn't worked for the
 13 company for more than 90 days or something, that that was
 14 their regular practice, would that practice always trump
 15 the interest of the disability -- disabled person?
 16 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. I believe that an employer
 17 is entitled, under the statute -- you've got to have a
 18 good, neutral reason unrelated to disability, but the
 19 bright line --
 20 QUESTION: Now you've added the word good. I
 21 thought it only had to be neutral.
 22 MR. DELLINGER: I mean good in the sense that it
 23 has to be legitimate, bona fide business reason.
 24 QUESTION: Something they always do.
 25 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. You've got to, because the

11 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 act requires you to make this appointment, but where
 2 we --
 3 QUESTION: Suppose you have a seniority system
 4 that's riddled with exceptions.
 5 MR. DELLINGER: Where you have a seniority
 6 system that's riddled with exceptions, it is perfectly
 7 open to someone who challenges that to say, you don't
 8 really have a neutral policy unrelated to disability.
 9 QUESTION: No, no, you do. I mean, here you
 10 happen to have just one exception. Well, suppose there
 11 were five or six, and so the argument would be, well, if
 12 you can make an exception for the hardship, the
 13 catastrophic illness, for this special situation in that
 14 one, what we want you to do is also make an exception for
 15 the handicapped person.
 16 Now, nobody's doubting the employer's good
 17 faith. The question is, well, why not make na exception
 18 for us. You have a lot of others. Let's have a trial on
 19 it to see how open to you that is.
 20 MR. DELLINGER: The answer to your question is,
 21 no, you are not required to do the reassignment merely
 22 because your seniority policy is one that applies
 23 seniority in some circumstances and not others.
 24 QUESTION: All right, then at that point I'd
 25 become uncertain what exactly -- why we should hold what

12 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 you want, from my point of view. That is, I can easily
 2 see this act simply requires the employer to act
 3 reasonably, and now you could say, where there's a
 4 longstanding seniority system, and there's nothing special
 5 about it, and there are zero or very few exceptions, it's
 6 automatically a reasonable thing to not stir up enormous
 7 trouble in the workplace by saying, we're going to start
 8 making exceptions. I could see that. I'm not saying I
 9 agree, but I understand it.
 10 But now, why is it, if there are, however, quite
 11 a few exceptions, that it isn't even open to the
 12 handicapped person to argue, make another, it's not
 13 unreasonable to make another?
 14 MR. DELLINGER: Let me preface my answer by
 15 saying that for decades US Airways has had an established
 16 seniority policy that covers all of these positions, which
 17 has been regularly followed, with one exception for
 18 catastrophic illnesses and one revision of how you
 19 calculate the time of seniority, so that that issue is
 20 not, you know, raised or put before the Court as to
 21 whether you would think that not a good reason.
 22 But it seems to me that under -- if you look at
 23 the sequence from the title VII through the Rehabilitation
 24 Act, through Hardison, the background principle that our
 25 civil rights laws have simply not restricted the ability

13 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 of an employer to make a good faith determination about
 2 how to fill positions, and that nothing in the ADA itself
 3 seems to question that bedrock assumption. That is to
 4 say, no one suggests, though it would be a perfectly --
 5 not unduly costly that you need to add positions. 
 6 Everyone seems to concede and agree that you don't need to
 7 transfer an employee to a position that would constitute
 8 a, quote, promotion, unquote, even though that might --
 9 the employee might be qualified to do that position. No
 10 one suggests that you have to bump an employee who was
 11 actually sitting in a position.
 12 Here, what you have is the defeated expectations
 13 under a seniority system, and if that system is bona fide,
 14 the way it works is to allow each employee to determine
 15 what his or her most important desires are, and that is
 16 what you gain through seniority. If you lose to --
 17 QUESTION: Mr. Dellinger --
 18 MR. DELLINGER: Yes.
 19 QUESTION: -- one of the reasons that I find
 20 this particular statute puzzling is that it's not like
 21 title VII. Title VII says, thou shalt not discriminate. 
 22 It says, you don't prefer -- you don't just redress
 23 imbalances. It's a straight nondiscrimination statute.
 24 This one isn't. This one is driven by a concept
 25 called, reasonable accommodation. It makes reasonable

14 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 accommodation -- if you don't reasonably accommodate,
 2 you're discriminating, and so it seems to me that this
 3 statute has reasonable accommodation, if it's undue
 4 hardship, then it would be unreasonable, but there's
 5 nothing like that in title VII. This disabilities act
 6 gives a starring role to reasonable accommodation, which
 7 it truly doesn't have in title VII, so to give that
 8 effect, couldn't you look at this and say, well, this man
 9 was already in the job, and no body is going to be out of
 10 work, so the accommodation is reasonable. If he were
 11 seeking to bump somebody else, it wouldn't be reasonable. 
 12 Why isn't that an appropriate way to look at this act
 13 that's driven by the idea, reasonable accommodation?
 14 MR. DELLINGER: Let me acknowledge that what
 15 makes this an interesting case is the fact that the ADA
 16 does go beyond merely prohibiting hostile discrimination,
 17 so you're right that there are things that an employer
 18 affirmatively has to do that it doesn't have to do for
 19 other employees under this act.
 20 The general language of the act, though, in my
 21 view is not sufficient to change the landscape that
 22 existed under the Rehabilitation Act, where the Courts had
 23 uniformly held that reassignment was never required. It's
 24 now a possibility, but you're never required.
 25 QUESTION: But did the statute have the word,

15 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 reassignment in it, as this one does?
 2 MR. DELLINGER: It did not have in it the word,
 3 reassignment, but we don't think that that word is
 4 intended to change -- in the Hardison case under title VII
 5 it was a reasonable accommodation case, and yet the Court
 6 said, no, there's a bright line. We're never -- even
 7 though the religious part of title VII requires a
 8 reasonable accommodation, we're never going to require
 9 another employee to sacrifice his or her standing under
 10 the seniority policy.
 11 Now, the other part of your question, I think
 12 the question asked by Justice Breyer was, but what if it's
 13 really reasonable in a particular instance, and here's
 14 where I need to suggest why that approach is fundamentally
 15 inconsistent with how a seniority system operates. You
 16 are introducing an element of judgment and discretion
 17 which will unsettle settled expectations in a way that is
 18 completely unpredictable. What happens is, you simply
 19 can't know what the domino effect will be of substituting
 20 for a seniority system.
 21 This is a system that is now operated by lower
 22 level managers who need to keep a posted list where every
 23 employee knows what the position is. If someone -- it
 24 would be a fundamental alteration of the system to require
 25 the employer no longer to utilize this neutral basis. For

16 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 example --
 2 QUESTION: I notice that one of the amicus
 3 briefs suggests -- on behalf of labor unions suggests that
 4 that might well be true if it were the subject of
 5 collective bargaining and an agreement, but not for an
 6 ordinary employer plan. Is that how you read the brief?
 7 MR. DELLINGER: That is how you read that brief,
 8 and I see that is not a distinction which Congress made in
 9 title VII when it chose there to protect seniority
 10 plans,and it is not one that seems to make a great deal of
 11 sense here. That is, in many States, in spite of the
 12 language put in by US Airways, in many States the
 13 provisions of a company plan are legally enforceable in
 14 court.
 15 Moreover, I don't think there's any intent on
 16 Congress to weigh in on the question of whether the
 17 workforce should be unionized or not unionized by giving
 18 the disabled lesser rights --
 19 QUESTION: Then if that's true, then what
 20 meaning do we give to reasonable accommodation in the ADA?
 21 MR. DELLINGER: I think what reasonable
 22 accommodation --
 23 QUESTION: It has to be something different, I
 24 assume, than undue hardship, because that's a separate
 25 defense.

17 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DELLINGER: Undue hardship, that's right,
 2 really goes to cost on an employer. I think the
 3 reasonable accommodation language here requires an
 4 employer to take affirmative steps to try to enable a
 5 person with a disability to continue in the workplace, and
 6 in particular with respect to reassignments, to look for
 7 vacant places to make second job accommodatable, for
 8 example, but not to cross a very major line --
 9 QUESTION: But in a situation where the
 10 employer's policy is just to create open positions every
 11 quarter, that aren't enforceable anyway on behalf of any
 12 employee, is it unreasonable to say the employer has to
 13 accommodate this disabled worker?
 14 MR. DELLINGER: Yes, it is unreasonable for the
 15 following reason. The reassignment, the sort of quarterly
 16 declaration of vacancy to which you refer is simply how a
 17 system operates where every employee accumulates seniority
 18 and then gets to choose the position and the shift, so
 19 that if you gain seniority, you get enough, you say thank
 20 goodness I can now get off the graveyard shift, I can go
 21 on the swing shift or the day shift position, I've gained
 22 all of this, and that is rebid every quarter. People
 23 rebid on positions, and that seems like a perfectly
 24 reasonable thing to do.
 25 It is a -- there's nothing -- what is the bright

18 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 line, I think, here is that Congress has -- would have
 2 fought long and debated hard before it took the major step
 3 of saying an employer could not, at the end of the day,
 4 once all accommodations had been made, choose a person for
 5 a position based on who was the best-qualified or who was
 6 the most senior.
 7 Now, let me say again what --
 8 QUESTION: Your argument for that, as I
 9 understand it, is the argument that you've repeated in a
 10 couple, or your claim that you've repeated in a couple of
 11 instances that there would be something fundamentally
 12 unhinging to the seniority system to allow a disabilities
 13 exception, and that seems to me in part sort of an
 14 empirical question.
 15 I mean, if a company like yours was going to
 16 have 100 disability exceptions a month at every terminal,
 17 yes, I can see it, but is there any reason to believe that
 18 the magnitude of the possible disabilities exceptions
 19 under reasonable accommodation would be so great as to
 20 have that kind of cataclysmic effect on the general
 21 reliance that employees can place on seniority?
 22 MR. DELLINGER: Justice Souter, that is a good
 23 question that I think would go to whether it was an undue
 24 hardship.
 25 QUESTION: Well, it would go to that, but

19 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 wouldn't it -- you know, it would go to --
 2 MR. DELLINGER: But here, on the question of
 3 unreasonableness, I think we're looking at a question of
 4 principle. As Judge Posner said in the Seventh Circuit
 5 decision, it is a difference not just of cost but of
 6 principle, and here the principle at stake is the interest
 7 of other employees, so --
 8 QUESTION: There's no question, to the extent of
 9 the exceptions, their interest is going to be discounted
 10 in some way.
 11 MR. DELLINGER: And even -- even though we don't
 12 know the numbers, because we don't know ultimately how
 13 broadly the court will interpret the phrase, disability,
 14 which you have sub judice in other cases, and even them
 15 would take some working out. We don't know the numbers,
 16 but we do know how it would disrupt the expectations of
 17 employees.
 18 Here, for example, even though we have a bright
 19 line rule -- we have a bright line rule with promotions. 
 20 Even though promotions are a reassignment to a vacant
 21 position, you never have to promote, and that's because
 22 there's a good reason, it is thought, that promotions are
 23 not a reasonable accommodation. There's an even better
 24 reason, in my view, not to trump the rights and interests
 25 of other employees who have earned a right to a position,

1 and to try to look, as several of you have in questions,
 2 as to whether it might be reasonable in a particular
 3 instance, I don't know how you place this burden on
 4 managers in a system that is a seniority system to make
 5 those complex social judgments not knowing what the domino
 6 effect is. You could have --
 7 QUESTION: Well, one thing is easy to see is
 8 that if you bump somebody, it's no good. That's not
 9 reasonable. If somebody, as in this case, is already in
 10 the job, you let that person remain in the job, so it's
 11 not as though every exercise of seniority rights is of
 12 equal magnitude. If somebody is trying to bid for that
 13 job and some senior person otherwise would be laid off,
 14 then you say it's unreasonable, but here there isn't such
 15 a situation.
 16 MR. DELLINGER: That could well be. We don't
 17 know what the effect is, because someone will be bumped if
 18 they don't get their desired position. For example --
 19 QUESTION: I thought we know on the facts of
 20 this case that it's only a question of, that nobody is
 21 going to be bumped. The question is whether he stays in
 22 that job. There were jobs he could have done in cargo, if
 23 he weren't disabled.
 24 MR. DELLINGER: We don't know what the
 25 consequences will be, because what Mr. Barnett is

21 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 asking -- and this is from his declaration, which is not
 2 in the joint appendix, but is at page 3 of his declaration
 3 of February 28, he says, the intent and potential effect
 4 of my request was to have the employee who is going to
 5 displace me in the mailroom go around me and bump the next
 6 less senior position.
 7 You could have the following situation. You
 8 could have the person who's claiming the job in the
 9 mailroom could be an older single parent who's finally
 10 worked out child care arrangements and is entitled by
 11 seniority to the mailroom position, but who finds out,
 12 when, though she is senior in position, or he is senior in
 13 position, that Mr. Barnett is insulated from the normal
 14 operations system, would have to bump the next position
 15 down, which might well be a graveyard shift position, or a
 16 position in cargo, which the person was too old to handle
 17 the effects of, so you simply --
 18 QUESTION: What it boils down to, though, is, I
 19 think as Justice Ginsburg is suggesting, it means that no
 20 one can bump up, but it doesn't mean that anybody gets
 21 bumped down, and that, there's a -- I mean, she suggests
 22 there's a qualitative difference between those two.
 23 MR. DELLINGER: And I think we don't know that,
 24 Justice --
 25 QUESTION: Well, why don't we know that as a

22 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 matter of logic?
 2 MR. DELLINGER: Because it could well be that
 3 the more senior employee who needs to be in the mailroom,
 4 she needs -- her position is being eliminated. She needs
 5 to be in the mailroom, which has a day shift. She's
 6 senior and entitled to it. She can't get it. The next
 7 senior position, which she has to take, could be a
 8 graveyard shift, or a graveyard shift in cargo. She might
 9 not be able to work --
 10 QUESTION: That's true, but it's still the fact
 11 that we know that the effect of following Justice
 12 Ginsburg's suggestion is that no extra person gets bumped
 13 down. It's merely that one person doesn't bump up and
 14 bump the disabled employee down. That we can say with
 15 certainty, can't we?
 16 MR. DELLINGER: It may well be in many instances
 17 the bottom-most person will lose their job, and it could
 18 be that the more senior person would get a job that
 19 they -- that doesn't work out for them.
 20 QUESTION: But that's going to be a wash no
 21 matter how it works.
 22 MR. DELLINGER: Not necessarily.
 23 QUESTION: If you have zero-sum -- I mean, if
 24 you have a finite number of employees and you're laying
 25 somebody off, that's --

23 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DELLINGER: Under our plan, it won't be that
 2 more people will lose jobs, or get their less desired
 3 accommodation. It will be that the more senior employees
 4 do not get the position to which they are entitled, which
 5 for complex reasons may be very important to them.
 6 I'll reserve the remainder of my time.
 7 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Dellinger.
 8 Ms. Center, we'll hear from you.
 9 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLAUDIA CENTER
 10 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 11 MS. CENTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 12 please the Court:
 13 There are four points that must be made in this
 14 case. First of all, the petitioner's proposed definition
 15 of the term, reasonable accommodation, as meaning fair,
 16 proper, fit, appropriate, not extreme, not excessive, et
 17 cetera, et cetera, must be rejected, because that
 18 construction eviscerates all of the statutory defenses, is
 19 contrary to all of the regulations, and it is contrary to
 20 the listed reasonable accommodations, including
 21 reassignment.
 22 Second, the term reasonable accommodation in the
 23 ADA means a modification that enables the disabled
 24 employee to participate that is reasonable to the disabled
 25 employee.

24 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Third, even if you --
 2 QUESTION: You're -- stopping you at the second
 3 point, there, so from your point of view, reasonable
 4 relates only to its effect on the employee, not on anybody
 5 else?
 6 MS. CENTER: That's correct.
 7 Third, even if you disagree with my proposal for
 8 the definition of reasonable accommodation, the term must
 9 include the listed reasonable accommodations. Where it
 10 says reasonable accommodations may include, those
 11 accommodations listed, which include reassignment to a
 12 vacant position, are reasonable accommodations by
 13 definition.
 14 QUESTION: But the statute says may include. It
 15 doesn't say must include. Your definition says must
 16 include?
 17 MS. CENTER: The may include relates to the
 18 case-by-case individualized analysis that must take place. 
 19 All of the accommodations won't be necessary in every
 20 cases. The may include relates to the specific needs of
 21 the specific individual employee.
 22 And finally, reassignment to a vacant position
 23 means an actual reassignment to a job that is not
 24 currently occupied or that has not already been filled.
 25 QUESTION: Would you -- Ms. Center, why is it --

25 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 it has been conceded, I gather -- you didn't contest this
 2 anyway, in your brief, that reasonable accommodation would
 3 never include appointment to a promotion to a more -- a
 4 position that pays slightly more, even though the amount
 5 it pays more is negligible, so it's not -- you know, it's
 6 not a hardship on the employer. Why is that?
 7 MS. CENTER: Well, I think there are several
 8 reasons that the agency, the EEOC has come to that
 9 conclusion, which I agree with. First of all, the listed
 10 accommodation is reassignment to a vacant position. 
 11 Congress did not say promotion, and reassignment describes
 12 a lateral transfer, ordinarily.
 13 QUESTION: Well, but this is a vacant higher
 14 position. They didn't exclude that. This is a vacant
 15 position at a higher level. Why wouldn't that be
 16 included?
 17 MS. CENTER: Further, the EEOC regulations
 18 explain that the purpose of the reasonable accommodation
 19 is to enable the disabled employee to enjoy the privileges
 20 of employment along with similarly situated disable -
 21 nondisabled employees, to enjoy equal benefits, and if
 22 there's a promotion it's sort of -- it's contrary to that
 23 principle.
 24 QUESTION: Oh, but so is what you're urging
 25 here, this -- you're ending up giving the person here

26 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 seniority rights, which exceed those of other employees
 2 who have been there a certain amount of time.
 3 MS. CENTER: Well, in this case the job that Mr.
 4 Barnett ended up with was equal in terms of, a) he would
 5 have been employed, and b) at the same pay and, et cetera,
 6 the same level --
 7 QUESTION: I understand, but --
 8 MS. CENTER: -- as he would have gotten but for
 9 his disability.
 10 QUESTION: But you can't urge that your system
 11 assures that the disabled not be given any benefits that
 12 other employees would not get. You're giving him a
 13 benefit that they wouldn't get. They wouldn't be allowed
 14 to stay in that job, so why can't you do the same thing
 15 for a promotion?
 16 I mean, the other side has a criterion. Their
 17 criterion is, it is -- reasonable accommodation is limited
 18 to accommodation to the disability, so you provide him
 19 with a working space that will accommodate the fact that
 20 he can't stand up for too long, or you put him in another
 21 job at the same level that's vacant which doesn't require
 22 him to stand up. All of this accommodates the disability,
 23 they say.
 24 Whereas the accommodation you're urging here has
 25 nothing to do with accommodating the disability. It has

27 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to do with, I don't know, giving him a different job.
 2 MS. CENTER: Right, the accommodation is --
 3 QUESTION: They have a criterion. I don't
 4 understand what your criterion is, except, you know, do
 5 what is reasonable. Why isn't it reasonable to promote
 6 the disabled person if it -- it just costs a few more
 7 bucks. That's the only vacant job left. It's not
 8 hardship to the employer, so promote him. Why isn't that
 9 reasonable?
 10 MS. CENTER: Well, it's -- in addition to the
 11 reasons I already gave you, the agency has construed
 12 reassignment to a vacant position to not include
 13 promotion, and --
 14 QUESTION: Well, never mind the agency. Maybe
 15 the agency was unreasonable.
 16 (Laughter.)
 17 MS. CENTER: In this case, though, the
 18 accommodation that Mr. Barnett sought was not more
 19 seniority. The accommodation was reassignment to a vacant
 20 position and not --
 21 QUESTION: I'm not talking about him, though. 
 22 I'm asking for your theory of the case. What is it that
 23 makes an assignment not reasonable, or an accommodation
 24 not reasonable?
 25 MS. CENTER: An accommodation --

28 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Once you cut it loose from
 2 accommodating the disability, which is what the other side
 3 wants to do, once you cut it loose from that, why isn't
 4 everything up for grabs, including a promotion?
 5 MS. CENTER: It's not cut loose from the
 6 disability. The reasonable accommodation has to be made,
 7 by the clear a statutory language has to be made to the
 8 physical or mental limitations of the disabled employee. 
 9 Here, the reassignment enabled Mr. Barnett to retain --
 10 would have enabled Mr. Barnett to retain his employment. 
 11 It was because of his disability that he was unable to
 12 perform the job that he was relegated to when the
 13 positions were put up for bid, so it was through his
 14 disability --
 15 QUESTION: Well, it can -- it can be a
 16 reasonable accommodation. The question is, is he entitled
 17 to it in the face of an employer's seniority plan that
 18 would put somebody else there instead?
 19 MS. CENTER: Well, I think that he --
 20 QUESTION: I think that's the question.
 21 MS. CENTER: Well, there are -- I think he is
 22 entitled to that reasonable accommodation if all other
 23 possibilities are exhausted. If all of the prerequisites
 24 are met for reassignment, such as there is a vacancy, the
 25 disabled employee is qualified, and no statutory defense

29 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 such as undue hardship applies, I think he is entitled to
 2 the reassignment.
 3 QUESTION: Even though some other employee on
 4 the basis of greater seniority than the respondents under
 5 the plan could take that slot?
 6 MS. CENTER: Yes. I think he's entitled to that
 7 slot at that point.
 8 QUESTION: And you don't equate that with the
 9 situation of a promotion?
 10 MS. CENTER: No, it's not a promotion. It's a
 11 lateral transfer.
 12 QUESTION: Let me be sure of one thing. The
 13 case arises on a summary judgment, and I thought the court
 14 of appeals held that you were entitled to a trial, not
 15 that you were entitled to summary judgment. Are you
 16 claiming you are entitled to summary judgment?
 17 MS. CENTER: No, I'm -- I think that the
 18 employer is free to try and present a defense to our claim
 19 of failure to accommodate. Their defense would be undue
 20 hardship, or one of the other statutory defenses.
 21 QUESTION: Does reasonableness go the jury, or
 22 is there a jury, do you think?
 23 MS. CENTER: There would be a jury. I think in
 24 this case because reasonable accommodation -- because
 25 reassignment is one of the listed reasonable

30 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 accommodations, the judge could state that reassignment is
 2 a reasonable accommodation, but if you disagree with my,
 3 you know, construction of reasonable accommodation, then
 4 it could go to the jury, I suppose.
 5 QUESTION: In your summary judgment proceeding,
 6 did you challenge, at all, the employer's description of
 7 the seniority system?
 8 MS. CENTER: Yes, there was a challenge to that
 9 description.
 10 QUESTION: I didn't see it. That is, as far as
 11 I could see there's an affidavit on the employer's side,
 12 and Rule 56(e) requires you to point to specific, you
 13 know, record evidence or affidavits, et cetera. I didn't
 14 see any.
 15 MS. CENTER: Well, there wasn't -- I -- maybe I
 16 misunderstood the question, but there was in the record an
 17 effort to point out that they had made exceptions to the
 18 seniority system, that they had amended it --
 19 QUESTION: As far as I could tell, what I have
 20 to assume about the system is that it's widespread, it's
 21 longstanding, it governs 14,000 employees, the only
 22 exception is an exception for catastrophic medical
 23 transfer, and the -- they say, I guess we have to take it
 24 as given, that it would require your view would require US
 25 Air to weigh and balance conflicting claims and personal

31 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 desires of all US Air agents, and it would interfere with,
 2 I guess, the alternative child care arrangements,
 3 educational endeavors, and the ability of other, the other
 4 employees to continue working for the company.
 5 Now, those seem to me the facts. I didn't see
 6 any refutation of them --
 7 MS. CENTER: There are additional facts --
 8 QUESTION: -- and therefore I assume, for
 9 summary judgment purposes, I take those as a given, and if
 10 I'm not supposed to, I'd like to know right now.
 11 MS. CENTER: There are additional facts, in
 12 addition to the catastrophic illness exception there is a
 13 significant modification to how to calculate furlough
 14 seniority. There is a change from department seniority to
 15 company seniority. In addition, as the petitioner has
 16 conceded, the personnel policy guide containing the
 17 seniority policy states on its face that it's not a
 18 contract, it's merely a --
 19 QUESTION: No, that's given. I assume it's not.
 20 MS. CENTER: And the grievance procedure, where
 21 by employees would bring these seniority matters to the
 22 company's attention, that grievance procedure says, you're
 23 not allowed to grieve something that's required by Federal
 24 law, and we get to decide what's required, so in that
 25 circumstance it seems to me not reasonable for an employee

32 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to believe that the job assignment policy is going to
 2 trump a legitimate need for reasonable accommodation under
 3 a Federal law.
 4 QUESTION: Given that statement, to get to
 5 this -- what I think of anyway as the heart of this
 6 matter, assuming I don't accept your view of reasonable
 7 accommodation, assuming that I accept the view that
 8 reasonableness includes the interest of other workers and
 9 perhaps the interest of management as well, all right,
 10 given that view of it, when you come up with the
 11 characteristics that I've mentioned and that you added to,
 12 why isn't it reasonable for the employer to say, look, if
 13 I give this person the job, there's an alternative chain I
 14 have to bump that really causes disruption in the company. 
 15 It throws everything up for grabs.
 16 I can't enforce a seniority system under that
 17 kind of regime, but even if I could, all these other
 18 workers here are going to be disrupted, too, and that's
 19 what makes my seniority system reasonable in the
 20 circumstance. Now, your reply to that is precisely what?
 21 MS. CENTER: The sort of domino effect has been
 22 vastly overstated by this case by the petitioner. The
 23 actual impact of this sort of accommodation in this case
 24 and in other cases is to permit the disabled individual to
 25 have one assignment, and then replacing, on the list of

33 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 possible jobs for people to bid on, replacing that
 2 assignment would be the job that the person left, so each
 3 reassignment leaves a vacancy to be put on the list of
 4 jobs --
 5 QUESTION: I don't understand that part of your
 6 answer, though I want to hear the rest, because if there
 7 are 7,000 jobs missing, then it will be 7,000 people at
 8 the end of the day without a job, and either you go down
 9 one chain and bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, or you go down
 10 a different chain and bump, bump, bump, bump, bump. The
 11 harm is precisely the same. It's a question of which
 12 people suffer it, so I don't see why there isn't a domino
 13 effect. It's this chain, or that chain.
 14 MS. CENTER: Right, but in terms of the
 15 particular chain, there's a list of jobs upon which the
 16 nondisabled employees can bid, and those would include all
 17 of the jobs that remain vacant after the reassignment, as
 18 well as the job that the disabled individual left, so the
 19 actual impact is modest. It's removing one job on the
 20 list and adding a different job on the list.
 21 QUESTION: Well, isn't it like musical chairs in
 22 a way? I mean, someone is going to lose out to the
 23 disabled person.
 24 MS. CENTER: Someone may get a bob that they
 25 would -- a job where they would have preferred another

34 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 job.
 2 QUESTION: Yes.
 3 MS. CENTER: That's correct, but no one would
 4 lose their job because of the reassignment.
 5 QUESTION: Well, it may be a job -- I mean, it
 6 depends. It may be a job that the person can't take, such
 7 as the person who had arranged from child care, and
 8 simply, the only other job available is one that the
 9 person cannot do. I mean, that's possible.
 10 Why isn't it -- as I read this statute, I don't
 11 see anything in it which says that if -- there's plenty in
 12 it that says we're going to sacrifice some of the
 13 convenience of the employers to the needs of the
 14 handicapped, but I don't see anything in it that says
 15 we're going to sacrifice the expectations of coworkers to
 16 the handicapped. Why isn't it a perfectly feasible
 17 reading of reasonable accommodation to mean an
 18 accommodation that, among other things, does not defeat
 19 the reasonable expectation of fellow employees?
 20 MS. CENTER: Well, you could conclude that, but
 21 I think it's -- if you look at the statutory structure, if
 22 you looked at the list of reasonable accommodations, if
 23 you look at the governing regulations, all of these
 24 provisions explain how the equities are weighed in the
 25 statutory --

35 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: What is there in any of them that
 2 shows that Congress envisioned not just putting some
 3 burden on the employer, but putting some burden on fellow
 4 employees?
 5 MS. CENTER: Well, the --
 6 QUESTION: I mean, it mentions vacancy only. I
 7 mean, it mentions vacancy because nobody's hurt if there's
 8 a vacancy, but somebody is hurt if there's a vacancy to
 9 which somebody has seniority entitlement.
 10 MS. CENTER: Well, the plain language of the
 11 statute requires that the employer provide reasonable
 12 accommodation, and the defense is undue hardship, and so
 13 that's how the statute works. If there's no other
 14 possible accommodation --
 15 QUESTION: Yes, but if I reject that view of the
 16 statute on the one I was taking, I'd still like to know
 17 what the response is to what I think is the main point,
 18 which is not the domino effect. If I paraphrase it, life
 19 is very difficult in a big company when you lay off 7,000
 20 people. It's terrible, and the one think that the 7, the
 21 14,000 who remain have to be certain about is that there's
 22 a fair system in place, and once we open it to this kind
 23 of argument, well, it's over.
 24 Your client has a very bad back. I might think
 25 that's somebody that this act should protect, but when we

36 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 get to the reasonable accommodation stage, at that point,
 2 if all those people are in the act, I can't run my system,
 3 says the employer, because the claims for special
 4 exemption in the bumping will be endless.
 5 Now, your response to that is what?
 6 MS. CENTER: Well, if you disagree with our
 7 reading of the term, reasonable accommodation, the term
 8 still would require a case-by-case individualized analysis
 9 of whether it was reasonable in this situation, and what
 10 the petitioner wants is a per se rule for bona fide
 11 seniority policies, and that's completely contrary to the
 12 way that the statute works, which is case-by-case
 13 analysis.
 14 QUESTION: -- say that your client could be
 15 bumped by someone who's more severely handicapped if he
 16 were in that position?
 17 MS. CENTER: I think that each of the
 18 handicapped employees would be entitled to reassignment to
 19 a vacant position. If my client was in that position
 20 already, it would not be a vacancy, so it wouldn't be
 21 available.
 22 QUESTION: Well, but I -- it's my understanding
 23 that these positions are deemed open at some point.
 24 MS. CENTER: Well I think, then, that the client
 25 would be -- the more disabled individual would be entitled

37 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to reassignment. They both would be entitled to
 2 reassignment.
 3 QUESTION: Well, that's -- I think you've missed
 4 my point. Why wouldn't that person be as entitled to the
 5 position that your client occupies temporarily, when as a
 6 part of his or her reassignment or accommodation,
 7 reasonable accommodation?
 8 MS. CENTER: There could be conflicting requests
 9 for accommodation, that's correct.
 10 QUESTION: Would that person be entitled to that
 11 position --
 12 MS. CENTER: There would be a number of ways
 13 to --
 14 QUESTION: -- using your argument?
 15 MS. CENTER: I don't believe that the more
 16 disabled employee would be entitled to bump the less-
 17 disabled employee. I think that --
 18 QUESTION: Why?
 19 MS. CENTER: Why? Because the employee that
 20 needs the accommodation continues to need the
 21 accommodation. The other employee also needs the
 22 accommodation.
 23 QUESTION: But you could say that about the
 24 people who have the job in the first instance, couldn't
 25 you?

38 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. CENTER: Excuse me.
 2 QUESTION: The person who had that position and
 3 had his or her life worked out, day care, et cetera, et
 4 cetera, also needed that position.
 5 MS. CENTER: That's correct.
 6 QUESTION: So the argument's the same.
 7 MS. CENTER: But the argument is that there's a
 8 Federal law in this case that requires reasonable
 9 accommodation, including reassignment.
 10 QUESTION: Let me ask you this. What is your
 11 client's disability?
 12 MS. CENTER: He has a back impairment.
 13 QUESTION: What does that mean?
 14 MS. CENTER: He has an orthopedic disability. 
 15 He has pain, he has problems in his disks.
 16 QUESTION: Has it been established that he in
 17 fact qualifies as disabled, or is that something we're
 18 just assuming arguendo at this stage of the case?
 19 MS. CENTER: It's disputed. A summary judgment
 20 motion was denied on that issue, and so at this point I
 21 imagine we're assuming arguendo.
 22 QUESTION: May I ask about a hypothetical that's
 23 running through my mind. Under your opponent's view, as I
 24 understand it, it would be at least theoretically possible
 25 that the job your client has occupied up to now, and he

39 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 wants to move because of his disability, would be the job
 2 most people on the seniority list would want if it were
 3 available, but they could nevertheless say they don't have
 4 to accommodate. Am I right on that?
 5 MS. CENTER: Could you ask it one more time? 
 6 I'm sorry.
 7 QUESTION: It seems to me theoretically possible
 8 that he is -- because of his disability, he's leaving a
 9 job that is a very attractive job for a nondisabled
 10 person, and that everybody on the seniority list, if given
 11 the choice of jobs, would pick his job, that under your
 12 opponent's view it would nevertheless -- they could
 13 nevertheless refuse to accommodate him.
 14 MS. CENTER: That's correct, and my client, Mr.
 15 Barnett's goal is not to get the plum job. Mr. Barnett's
 16 goal is to get a job that he can do despite his
 17 disability, so the purpose is not to prefer the disabled
 18 employee. The purpose is to enabled the disabled employee
 19 to retain employment and to accommodate their limitations.
 20 QUESTION: But it does have the effect of giving
 21 a preference. That whole list of reasonable
 22 accommodations -- let's forget a seniority system. One of
 23 the accommodations is part-time. Suppose somebody who has
 24 an exhaustion problem, can't work a full day, and then
 25 there's somebody else who says, but I'm a single mom, and

40 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 I've got children at home, and they don't have to
 2 accommodate to me, I don't understand it.
 3 Your answer is, well, there's a Federal law and
 4 it doesn't protect you, but that would create the same
 5 kind of friction in the workforce. People feel that they 
 6 have been disadvantaged for no just reason, so -- but all
 7 those, what the statute lists as reasonable
 8 accommodations, every one of those could adversely affect
 9 someone who has in that person's view an equally good
 10 reason to get the break. It is a preference system.
 11 MS. CENTER: That's correct. The petitioner
 12 concedes that the reasonable accommodation mandate
 13 requires employers to do certain things for disabled
 14 employees that they may choose not to do for nondisabled
 15 employees.
 16 QUESTION: Sure, but preferring one -- I mean,
 17 giving someone a benefit that someone else doesn't get,
 18 such as allowing them to do a certain job sitting down
 19 when everybody else has to do it standing up, or what-
 20 not, that doesn't disadvantage the others. That doesn't
 21 destroy any of their expectations when they took the job,
 22 and the same thing with allowing somebody to work part-
 23 time. It doesn't help me any that somebody can work part-
 24 time now.
 25 Sure, I'm not allowed to do it, just as I'm not

41 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 allowed to do the job sitting down, but it doesn't hurt
 2 me, whereas what happens here is that the person who had
 3 an expectation of seniority entitlement to a certain job
 4 has been frustrated in that expectation. It seems to me
 5 that's quite different. I mean, we're not talking about
 6 whether one employee can be preferred over another. 
 7 Certainly, the disabled employee can be.
 8 But the question is whether it's a reasonable
 9 accommodation when it requires you to harm another
 10 employee in that employee's job or in that employee's
 11 legitimate expectations, and I think that's really what's
 12 at issue here, whether it's just the employer that's going
 13 to be inconvenienced by this statute, or other employees
 14 as well. Why isn't it reasonable to say you cannot
 15 destroy the expectations of other employees? What in the
 16 statute shows that you can?
 17 MS. CENTER: Well, it's true that in certain
 18 cases providing the reassignment to a vacant position ends
 19 up giving a priority to the employee over a nondisabled
 20 employee. That can happen, but that's not the purpose of
 21 the accommodation. The purpose of the accommodation is to
 22 enable the disabled employee to retain their employment,
 23 which directly serves the vocational and the equality
 24 goals of the act, and the reverse --
 25 QUESTION: Yes, but to the extent that you think

42 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 reasonable, the word reasonable and reasonable
 2 accommodation requires what happens to other employees as
 3 well as a result of the accommodation, then you have a
 4 different question. If you approach it the way you do,
 5 that it refers only to what's reasonable for the disabled
 6 person, that's different, so we have to decide what
 7 reasonable accommodation really means, don't we?
 8 MS. CENTER: And if you do decide that
 9 reasonable takes into account other employees, in this
 10 case the equities really favor Mr. Barnett, because Mr.
 11 Barnett is the one that faced job loss. The person who
 12 came in and bid on Mr. Barnett's job had no compelling
 13 need for the job. He was perfectly able to continue doing
 14 his existing job, and Mr. Barnett, by contrast, because
 15 the accommodation was denied, became inevitably
 16 unemployed, so the equities will frequently favor the
 17 disabled employee who faces job loss, even if you pull out
 18 reasonable separately like that.
 19 QUESTION: I hate to belabor the point, Ms.
 20 Center, but the more disabled employee, someone who's
 21 severely disabled, if that person has to be accommodated
 22 and we only have to look at that person's needs in making
 23 our reasonableness determination, I don't understand why
 24 your client can't be bumped if he were in that position.
 25 MS. CENTER: If you pulled out reasonable?

43 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: And only -- and you limited that
 2 determination to the disabled person who has to be
 3 accommodated.
 4 MS. CENTER: Well, if you pulled out reasonable
 5 in that way, I think there'd be a difficulty arguing it
 6 would be reasonable to disrupt another effective
 7 accommodation that's already in place. It might be
 8 reasonable to do some other things --
 9 QUESTION: But that's -- then your argument is
 10 only different in -- slightly from the argument that you
 11 have to take into consideration the disruption that's
 12 caused in others' lives when you disrupt the seniority
 13 system.
 14 MS. CENTER: Well, I think that the disruption,
 15 as we state in our brief, can be considered in the undue
 16 hardship defense. It's a detailed defense that's drafted
 17 to consider all of these factors.
 18 QUESTION: Well, could we consider the
 19 disruption to your client in the undue hardship category?
 20 MS. CENTER: No. I think the disruption to my
 21 client in the job loss is the harm that results from the
 22 failure to accommodate.
 23 QUESTION: But aren't you saying that in the
 24 case that Justice Thomas poses you do consider the
 25 disruption to your client as well as the interest of the

44 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 more --
 2 MS. CENTER: Correct. I misunderstood.
 3 QUESTION: Okay. Then why don't you do that
 4 across the board? In other words, why doesn't -- why
 5 shouldn't -- why don't you have to concede that
 6 reasonableness always takes into consideration the
 7 interest of other employees?
 8 MS. CENTER: Because I think that's contrary to
 9 the structure of the statute. I think it's contrary to
 10 the description of reasonable accommodations. It's
 11 contrary to the regulations.
 12 QUESTION: Yes, but can you find any textual
 13 basis in the statute that says when you're dealing with
 14 comparative interests of two disabled people you consider
 15 the interests of both in determining what is reasonable,
 16 but when you're considering the comparative interests of a
 17 disabled person and others, you don't consider both?
 18 MS. CENTER: I was --
 19 QUESTION: Is there any textual basis for that?
 20 MS. CENTER: Perhaps I'm still misunderstanding,
 21 but I was answering the question assuming that my reading
 22 of the statute was rejected and that we were looking at
 23 equities in the word reasonable.
 24 QUESTION: I see. You weren't conceding -- all
 25 right, just for argument.

45 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. CENTER: Yes.
 2 QUESTION: Do I misunderstand? I thought you
 3 had agreed earlier that it would never be reasonable to
 4 bump another employee.
 5 MS. CENTER: That's correct.
 6 QUESTION: Okay. So you're always talking about
 7 transfer to a vacant position. I don't understand the
 8 competition between two disabled persons. Each of them
 9 has to be given a vacant job. If the job's already
 10 filled, it doesn't matter whether it's filled by another
 11 disabled person or by a perfectly healthy person.
 12 MS. CENTER: That's correct. It will often, I
 13 think, just be the chronology, who requests accommodation
 14 first, who gets reassigned, and then you go on to the next
 15 disabled employee if there is one and deal with their
 16 accommodation.
 17 QUESTION: And the reason you can't bump another
 18 employee is that that's unreasonable, is that --
 19 MS. CENTER: No. The reason is that the
 20 accommodation listed is reassignment to a vacant position,
 21 and that vacant language was put in there to prevent
 22 bumping an occupied position, bumping an individual.
 23 QUESTION: Well, if you -- what you've said,
 24 you're making of this statute in this respect something
 25 different from, in title VII, where you have past proven

46 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 discrimination, so the employer may have to give a remedy,
 2 that remedy may adversely affect other people, and the
 3 calculus that the Court has to make is, yes, they can be
 4 hurt, but not too much, and isn't that exactly what is
 5 going on here?
 6 If we reject your client-centered interpretation
 7 of reasonable, it's just the same thing. 
 8 Nondiscrimination, this statute goes beyond
 9 nondiscrimination. It requires reasonable accommodation. 
 10 What's reasonable? Of course, you always have to take
 11 into account the interests of other people.
 12 MS. CENTER: That's correct. If we -- if the
 13 Court rejects my view of the term, reasonable
 14 accommodation, you'd have to take into account all of
 15 those considerations, but you could not adopt, I don't
 16 believe, the per se rule suggested by the petitioner that
 17 neutral, you know, selection criteria are always going to
 18 trump the ADA.
 19 For example, your part-time working scenario,
 20 that could be eliminated by a neutral rule that no one can
 21 work less than full-time, so that can't be the rule. If
 22 it's reasonable, pulled out and looked at in the different
 23 criteria, then it has to be case-by-case. It can't simply
 24 be deference to a neutral selection criteria.
 25 QUESTION: When I got the case by case, I look

47 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 at the record here, and it doesn't seem to me as if your
 2 client wants to prove anything. They'll accept what the
 3 other side says about it as we discussed, and then we just
 4 have to decide in this case, is that enough or not. Is
 5 that right?
 6 MS. CENTER: Well, I think there are a number of
 7 items in the record that show that the actual disruption
 8 to the employer, as well as the impact on other employees,
 9 would have been extremely modest, and that retaining Mr.
 10 Barnett in the job he'd been successfully performing for
 11 years was -- would have been an entirely reasonable
 12 accommodation, if you want to pull out reasonable.
 13 QUESTION: It's not a matter of proof. We're at
 14 the pretrial stage.
 15 MS. CENTER: Well, that's true, and there's
 16 certainly sufficient evidence under Reeves for our client
 17 to have a trial on that issue, should --
 18 QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Center.
 19 MS. CENTER: Thank you.
 20 QUESTION: Mr. Dellinger, you have 2 minutes
 21 remaining.
 22 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER, III
 23 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 24 MR. DELLINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, when it comes
 25 to filling positions, which is fundamentally different, I

48 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 think, than adding other elements, there's nothing
 2 anomalous about a per se rule, nor is that inconsistent
 3 with giving individualized considerations. The rehab act
 4 and title VII both said that you don't displace seniority
 5 systems.
 6 In Hardison v. TWA, this Court did not say you
 7 have to ask whether the more senior employee's reason for
 8 needing the Saturday off was either trivial or serious. 
 9 When it comes to positions, there is a good reason for
 10 letting the more senior employee choose the more desirable
 11 position. I don't think either the line managers or the
 12 Ninth Circuit engaging in an individual case-by-case
 13 assessment could possibly make that a workable system.
 14 The notion that there's no one who's going to be
 15 hurt reduces to this, that when the more senior employee
 16 claims the position under the regular operation of the
 17 statute, their response is to say, well, that more senior
 18 employee can always go and be a cargo handler on the night
 19 shift. We don't know that. We don't know if that would
 20 work.
 21 In effect what you're doing when you promote
 22 somebody to a greater seniority priority is that you are
 23 promoting, and we do know that however reasonable it might
 24 be in a particular case, if you did an intensive case-by-
 25 case thing to say, why don't we promote this person to the

49 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 secretarial supervisor, that itself is never required,
 2 because we think that in a sense you're really going to
 3 lose your way in trying to manage a company if you move
 4 away from bedrock proposition that an employer is never
 5 required to choose the less-qualified or the less-senior
 6 person once they've made all the other accommodations. 
 7 That would be a major social change.
 8 There is an argument that someone who loses one
 9 position because of a disability ought to have a priority
 10 claim for another position even over someone who is more
 11 qualified or more senior for it. That would be a major
 12 policy change that we -- for which there are arguments for
 13 and against. The Congress --
