6             Mr. Dvoretzky.

7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY

8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9             MR. DVORETZKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10 it please the Court:

11             Congress amended the discharge bar in 1978

12 to add actual fraud as an additional ground for barring

13 discharge.  That amendment must be given meaning.  Our

14 interpretation is the only one that does so.

15             Consistent with the commonlaw understanding

16 that Congress codified, "actual fraud" is a term of art

17 that includes a recipient's knowing participation in a

18 deliberate fraudulent transfer.  By contrast, the Fifth

19 Circuit's holding that actual fraud invariably requires

20 a misrepresentation makes Congress's amendment

21 superfluous because it equates actual fraud with the

22 preexisting terms, "false pretenses" and "false

23 representation."

24             Respondent's interpretation is even worse.

25 It merely restates a preexisting scienter requirement.

Alderson Reporting Company

1 And in any event, Congress could not plausibly have

4

2 added "or actual fraud" to the discharge bar in order to

3 modify the previous terms to mean intentional false

4 pretenses or an intentional false representation.

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You'd  you'd

6 acknowledge, wouldn't you, that if the language we used

7 in Field against Mans is applicable, or if we meant it,

8 that you lose?  Some degree of reliance is required to

9 satisfy the element of causation inherent in the phrase

10 "obtained by"?

11             MR. DVORETZKY:  I don't think that language

12 is applicable here, because that language has to be 

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no. I

14 understand, and I understand your argument there.  But

15 if it is, if we think that language does apply across

16 the board, you certainly lose.

17             MR. DVORETZKY: Yes, if you believe that

18 "obtained by" invariably requires reliance, but it does

19 not.  The  the language in Field was in the context of

20 a misrepresentation case.  What obtained by requires is

21 causation.  In the context of a fraudulent transfer

22 where the recipient knowingly participates in a

23 deliberate fraudulent transfer, centuries of common law

24 established that he commits actual fraud himself.  He

25 therefore obtains the property by actual fraud.  That's

2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you would have to 

3 you would have to show down the road that the  the

4 money was obtained by Ritz.  Because as I understand it,

5 it was transferred from the first company to a bunch of

6 other companies, not to Mr. Ritz himself.

7             MR. DVORETZKY:  That  that's correct,

8 Justice Ginsburg.  Down the road, we would need to show

9 that our State law veilpiercing theory is correct.

10             That, however, is not the basis on which the

11 Fifth Circuit rejected our claim.  The Fifth Circuit

12 rejected our claim on the sole ground that it thought

13 actual fraud invariably requires a misrepresentation.

14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you have to show

15 under State law not only the veilpiercing   that

16 there's veil piercing, but that there is fraud under

17 State law?

18             MR. DVORETZKY:  Correct.  We would need to

19 show two things under State law:  First of all, that

20 Ritz orchestrated a fraudulent transfer by transferring

21 assets from Chrysalis to his other entities in order to

22 hinder creditors.

23             Second of all, we would have to show that he

24 perpetrated that fraud for his own personal benefit,

25 which is what would then allow us to pierce the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 corporate veil and hold him personally liable for the

6

2 fraud that he committed.

3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Are you piercing the

4 corporate veil as to the first company, or as to the

5 transferee companies?

6             MR. DVORETZKY:  We are piercing the  it

7 could be either, but  but I think we are piercing the

8 veil as to the transferee companies because we're

9 pursuing this on a recipient theory.

10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  Because  because I

11 understood your whole brief to be pursuing this on a

12 recipient theory.

13             MR. DVORETZKY: Correct.

14             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And your brief, you know,

15 makes some sense as that.  But then when you look back

16 to your complaint, it suggests that the veilpiercing

17 actually was attempted as to the transferor company,

18 which doesn't do you any good under your theory.

19             MR. DVORETZKY: So the complaint fully spells

20 out all of the details related to the transfers.  And

21 generally  this is at Joint Appendix 97  asks for

22 avoidance of all fraudulent transfers to the extent

23 necessary to satisfy plaintiff's claims.  Throughout the

24 litigation, the claims were then pursued on a transferee

25 theory.  The Fifth Circuit understood the claim that way

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 and rejected it solely because, again, the lack of a

7

2 misrepresentation.

3             The problem with the Fifth Circuit's

4 interpretation is that it nullifies Congress's

5 amendment, or actual fraud.  It makes it meaningless

6 simply by restating the previous terms, "false

7 pretenses" or "false representations."  When Congress

8 added "or actual fraud" to the discharge bar, it was

9 legislating against the backdrop of hundreds of years of

10 commonlaw usage of that term.

11             For centuries, courts had used "actual

12 fraud" to refer to fraudulent transfers.

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  I  I know.  And I'm

14 rather slightly selfregarding the statement.  But, I

15 mean, 20, 30 years ago, I had a case on fraudulent

16 conveyance where my law clerk looked up every single

17 case in sight, poor man.  And we went back to Queen

18 Elizabeth, and I wrote down what I thought it was.

19 Well, obviously, that affects my  my  my thinking on

20 this.  And I don't have any way of knowing that it's

21 still  what I wrote was correct.  It's called

22 Burnazos, if you want to look at it.  But not now.

23             The  but the point of the classical

24 examples that we found  let's take one of them  is a

25 person knowing that he's about  has creditors.  He has

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to know that he has creditors.  Maybe he knows of the

8

2 insolvency, and he transfers money to his wife rather

3 than to the creditors.  And she knows it too, and this

4 is a way of getting the money away.

5             That's a fraud classic, right?

6             MR. DVORETZKY:  Yes.

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So now when I look

8 at the statute, I see these words:  To the extent that

9 it's a debt, it's a debt obtained by actual fraud.

10             Now, wait.  Whose debt are we talking about?

11 We're talking about Creditor C, who was a creditor of

12 the transferor.  And it's the transferee, the  the

13 wife who obtained  she's the one who's got the money.

14 And so it sounds like the bankruptcy statute is saying

15 she's the one in her bankruptcy.  Now, that can't be

16 right.  And so  so how is this supposed to work?

17             I mean, now you're  the obvious question

18 to ask you is the question, if it doesn't mean

19 representation, give me one example of what it does

20 mean.  Well, I just gave you one, and as you can see,

21 I'm  I'm quite confused as to how that works.  And I

22 haven't seen another one.

23             MR. DVORETZKY:  I think the way your

24 hypothetical works, Justice Breyer, is that the

25 recipient in that instance, the wife 

Alderson Reporting Company

1             JUSTICE BREYER:  Uhhuh

9

2             MR. DVORETZKY:   commits actual fraud

3 herself.

4             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.

5             MR. DVORETZKY:  And when she commits actual

6 fraud herself, she incurs her own debts.

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  So for the fee  the

8 problem with her is she is not trying to deceive a

9 creditor of hers.  She is not  she is not trying to

10 deceive her creditor, it's the transferor whose

11 creditors are being fraudulently deceived.

12             MR. DVORETZKY:  True.  But if she is

13 conspiring, in effect, with the transferor, she is

14 facilitating his fraud.

15             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So you're

16 saying in a bankruptcy of the wife, this is money

17 obtained by fraud, which it is.  And the fact that she's

18 helped him defraud his creditors is sufficient to bring

19 us under the 1924 Massachusetts Statute.  It's copied

20 from the UCC, which ultimately is traced back to the

21 Statute of Elizabeth.  That's how it works?

22             MR. DVORETZKY:  Yes.

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  Thank you.

24             MR. DVORETZKY:  She  she commits  she

25 commits fraud.  In the course of committing, fraud she

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1 obtains money.  She then has a debt for that money, and 2 it's nondischargeable under 523(a)(2)(A). 3             JUSTICE BREYER:  Thank you. 4             MR. DVORETZKY:  That understanding is 5 consistent with the commonlaw understanding of actual 6 fraud, which is what Congress codified in order to add 7 an additional ground for discharge.  The legislative 8 history of the 1978 Code makes clear that Congress was 9 adding an additional ground for discharge, so it was 10 expanding  an additional ground for barring discharge, 11 excuse me.  So it was expanding the scope of the 12 discharge bar. 13             JUSTICE KAGAN:  It does make the language 14 "false pretenses" or "false representations" completely 15 superfluous, yes? 16             MR. DVORETZKY:  It does, but the key point 17 here is that it also expands upon that language, whereas 18 the Fifth Circuit's  the Fifth Circuit's 19 interpretation also makes "false pretenses" and "false 20 representations" superfluous without giving Congress's 21 amendment any additional work to do. 22             So too for Respondent's interpretation, 23 which first of all, merely restates a preexisting 24 scienter requirement, so it gives the amendment no 25 additional broadening scope.  And second of all, is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1 grammatically indefensible because "or actual fraud" is 2 not a narrowing phrase that modifies what comes before 3 it. 4             Congress could perhaps have simply replaced 5 "false pretenses" and "false representations" with "or 6 actual fraud," but that might have led to an unwarranted 7 negative inference by the deletion of terms "false 8 pretenses" and "false representations" that had been in 9 the statute for a very long time. 10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you  you would like 11 the Court to  to hold that "actual fraud" means 12 something other than false pretenses or 13 misrepresentation; that it's  it's a broader term, it 14 includes things that were not already included, period, 15 and then whatever other issues would be  to be 16 resolved on remand? 17             MR. DVORETZKY:  That's  that's correct, 18 Justice Ginsburg. 19             With respect to Respondent's interpretation, 20 first of all, as we established in our reply brief, 21 false pretenses and false representations already 22 required intentional fraud.  No court had interpreted 23 those terms in the discharge bar before 1978 to apply to 24 innocent conduct, and so there is no basis to think that 25 when Congress added "or actual fraud" to the statute, it
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 was simply restating an existing rule.

12

2             This Court has, in the past, refused to

3 infer  to interpret congressional amendments simply to

4 restate existing rules when there is a plausible 

5 indeed, settled, in light of the commonlaw 

6 understanding, like the one that we offer that gives the

7 amendment an additional function.

8             The other problem with Respondent's

9 interpretation, of course, is grammatical.  "Or" is a

10 disjunctive term that expands on what comes before; it's

11 not a term that limits what comes before.

12             And moreover, "actual fraud" is a noun

13 phrase that in  that represents both conduct; fraud,

14 and the way in which it is carried out, intentionally.

15 It's not simply a mens rea.

16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why did Congress

17 take the term "fraud" out of the Bankruptcy Act in 1903?

18             MR. DVORETZKY:  The legislative history

19 doesn't tell us why Congress did that.  What we do know

20 is that when Congress took out that term in 1903, at

21 least one legislator expressed concern that this was

22 leaving a category of frauds outside the discharge bar,

23 and that that was a mistake because the  the purpose

24 of the discharge bar has long been to afford relief only

25 for the honest but unfortunate debtor and not to allow

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
13 1 the Bankruptcy Code to be used for an engine for fraud. 2             In 1978, Congress closed that gap by adding 3 the additional ground for discharge back in. 4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So all  all you've 5 got in 1903 is one  one legislator. 6             MR. DVORETZKY:  Yes.  We have one legislator 7 expressing the concern  8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I have a big  this 9 isn't necessarily hostile to your position, but it's 10 kind of a big change to take fraud out of a bankruptcy 11 statute.  I mean, nobody seems to know why. 12             MR. DVORETZKY:  Nobody seems to know why. 13 We don't dispute, of course, that typically, most 14 commonly frauds will involve misrepresentations, and so 15 those frauds were still covered.  And of course, as a 16 result of Congress's drafting, there are other discharge 17 bars that apply to narrower types of  narrow and 18 different types of fraud. 19             And so Congress didn't completely forget 20 about fraud in 1903.  It did, however, take it out of 21 this particular discharge bar, over the concern 22 expressed by at least one  one legislator. 23             In the interim period, between 1903 and 24 1978, courts did note that the discharge bar in effect 25 at that time covered only false pretenses and false
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1 representations, and that there was in fact a gap.  And 2 then in 1978, as part of a comprehensive overhaul of the 3 Bankruptcy Code, Congress closed that gap. 4             And so we submit that this Court should 5 interpret the  the discharge bar in a way that gives 6 full effect to Congress's amendment.  Our interpretation 7 is consistent with the plain commonlaw meaning of the 8 words "actual fraud."  It does not require grammatical 9 distortions, and it accords with the purpose of the 10 discharge bar, which is, again, to provide relief only 11 for honest debtors and not to allow the Bankruptcy Code 12 to be used as an engine for fraud in the way that 13 occurred in this case. 14             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Murphy points out that 15 there are lots of other provisions in 523(a), which have 16 a lot of overlap on this provision on your reading.  And 17 then also the fraudulent conveyance provisions, if you 18 would talk a little bit about those. 19             MR. DVORETZKY:  Sure.  Let me address the 20 fraudulent conveyance provisions first. 21             The fraudulent conveyance provisions are 22 targeted at the transferor, not the transferee.  And so 23 our reading of 523 complements those provisions rather 24 than conflicts with them. 25             727 provides that there is no discharge at
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 all if a debtor transfers assets to  to hinder

15

2 creditors within a year of the bankruptcy filing.

3             548 allows the trustee to pursue claims for

4 transfers within two years, but nothing about our

5 reading of 523 is inconsistent with that.  It simply

6 provides that, in addition to those things, creditors

7 may pursue fraud claims where there is a fraudulent

8 transfer against the  the transferee.  And if the

9 transferee ends up in a double bankruptcy situation, so

10 to speak, then at that point, 523 complements the other

11 provisions.

12             With respect to the other discharge bars

13 that address fraud, there is inevitably some overlap

14 among these discharge bars.  Partly that's a result of

15 Congress's drafting.  Congress chose to use the word

16 "fraud" in multiple places, and so you're going to have

17 overlap as a result of that.  Partly it is a result of a

18 beltandsuspenders approach to effectuate the policy of

19 ensuring, again, that fraudulent debtors don't get away

20 with their fraud.

21             Our reading, however, does not lead to any

22 more overlap than Respondent's reading does.  Either

23 way, there is going to be overlap between the false

24 pretenses and false representations type of fraud, which

25 Respondent thinks (a)(2)(A) is limited to.  And

16

2 fiduciary fraud takes the form of a false pretense or a

3 false representation.

4             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  My question, so

5 I better ask  no.  Go.  You go.  I'll ask  I don't

6 want to take your time.

7             MR. DVORETZKY:  So the overlap is

8 inevitable.  That's not a reason to prefer Respondent's

9 interpretation when our interpretation also gives

10 Congress's amendment additional work to do.

11             Briefly, with respect to (a)(6), it's not at

12 all clear that this  this conduct would fit within

13 (a)(6), which has a higher standard, willful and

14 malicious injury, not just reckless disregard, which is

15 sufficient to establish actual fraud.

16             If I may, I'll reserve the remainder of my

17 time.

24             MS. HARRINGTON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief

25 Justice, and may it please the Court:

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
17 1             The Court of Appeals erred in holding that 2 Section 523(a)(2)(A) always requires proof of an 3 intentional misrepresentation in order to prove actual 4 fraud.  There are three main reasons why Petitioner and 5 the government are right about our interpretation of 6 Section 523(a)(2)(A). 7             The first is that this Court has said many 8 times that when Congress uses a term that has an 9 established commonlaw meaning, courts should give it 10 that meaning when it's used in a statute. 11             For centuries, the term "actual fraud" has 12 been used at common law to refer to schemes that are 13 in  that  that where property is transferred with 14 the  with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a 15 creditor.  There is no reason to give that text any 16 different meaning than in Section 523(a)(2)(a). 17             The second is that our view is the only 18 thing that  the only interpretation that gives any 19 meaning to the 1978 amendment. 20             And the third is that our view is consistent 21 with Congress's overarching purpose and the Bankruptcy 22 Code, that  that dishonors creditors  excuse me  23 dishonors debtors, not be permitted to use the Code to 24 get rid of their debts. 25             Now, Respondent offers a competing textual
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
18 1 interpretation of the term  of the phrase "or actual 2 fraud."  I think Petitioner has explained well why that 3 interpretation doesn't make any sense as an  as a 4 grammatical matter.  It also wouldn't give any effect to 5 the 1978 amendment. 6             Petitioner also relies on the  on the word 7 "obtained," which Justice Breyer was referring to as 8 well.  Excuse me.  Respondent does  Respondent 9 suggests that our interpretation doesn't give any 10 meaning to the word "obtained," if obtained doesn't mean 11 that a false representation was directed at a creditor. 12             But under our view, the word "obtained" 13 actually does two things:  The first thing it does is 14 the work that this Court described it as doing in 15 Cohen v. de la Cruz, which is it requires a causal 16 connection between the fraudulent act and the debtor's 17 acquisition of  or possession of the property or 18 money. 19             But the second thing it does, in the 20 fraudulent transfer context, specifically, is it sort of 21 screens out the innocent recipient of a fraudulent 22 transfer.  And so if Congress had instead used the 23 phrase "obtained as a result of actual fraud," then 24 argue  arguably, that could have brought in an 25 innocent recipient of a fraudulent transfer, because as

1 a result, I would suggest that you focus on the

2 transaction that caused the transfer of property.

3             But "obtained by" really focuses on the

4 action of the recipient.  And so it really just gets at

5 the recipient's mental state and  and fraudulent

6 activity.

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the part  you see,

8 it's still gnawing at me is I wish you had read this

9 case.  Because  because when we went through it,

10 this  this sentence, fraudulent  and I wouldn't

11 raise this, except the only example other than the

12 misrepresentation that you've come up with is the

13 fraudulent conveyance.

14             And what I said, after reading all 

15 "fraudulent conveyance law permits creditors to recover

16 money that a debtor has disposed of in a manner

17 similar," and then I described three paradigm cases.

18             All right.  So what they're thinking of is a

19 transferor has creditors.  And what he did well before

20 going into bankruptcy, but he knew he was likely to be

21 insolvent, the transferor transfers money to his friends

22 rather than the creditors, to a place that it's hard to

23 get at, you know, to somebody who is going to  all

24 right.

25             Now, looking at this statute, it seems to me

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that the person whose debt is going to survive

20

2 bankruptcy is not the transferor, because normally,

3 fraudulent conveyance law permitted his bankruptcy judge

4 to claw back the money.  But that's not what you're

5 talking about.  You're talking about the transferee, and

6 you're saying here, the transferee's participation in

7 the transferor's effort to defraud his creditor is

8 something that also survives.

9             And at that point I ask, of all the bad

10 things that people can do that might survive, why in

11 heaven's name do they pick on this one in respect to the

12 transferee?  I mean, after all, maybe the transferee

13 robbed a bank.  I mean, there are all kinds of bad

14 things that might survive, and  and don't.

15             So was  so am I  something's wrong with

16 my analysis, as you understand it, and that's what I've

17 got to get into my head.

18             MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, see, there are all

19 kinds of debts that  that do survive a bankruptcy,

20 including the debt for the transferor.

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  If I got what I'm

22 talking about right, in terms of the debt.

23             MS. HARRINGTON:  Well  so I think it is

24 important to realize there are two distinct debts:

25 There's the original debtor  there's original debt

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
21 1 from the creditor to debtor one.  Debtor one transfers 2 his property to a friend.  If the friend  with the 3 intent to defraud his creditor.  If the friend shares 4 that intent, then the State law or some Federal law 5 gives the creditor a cause of action to go after the 6 recipient, to go after the friend. 7             If that  if that is successful, then 8 there's a new debt that's created from  to the 9 creditor from the  from the friend.  And that's the 10 debt we're talking about here. 11             With respect to why that wouldn't be 12 dischargeable, when  if you're outside the time limits 13 that are covered by 548 or 727, the transferors 14 wouldn't  it's because the transferee, the recipient, 15 is the person who ends up with the money or the 16 property, right? 17             So the second overarching purpose of the 18 Bankruptcy Code is to let creditors get their money back 19 when they can.  And so it makes sense that Congress 20 would have wanted to give maybe a stronger remedy  21             JUSTICE BREYER:  I see. 22             MS. HARRINGTON:   against the person who 23 actually has the stuff at the end of the day. 24             And so I think that's why our  our reading 25 is consistent with the purpose of the  of the Code in

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is  is the veil

3 piercing that's going on here with respect to Chrysalis

4 as well, or just the companies to which Chrysalis's

5 assets were shifted?

6             MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, you know, Mr.

7 Dvorestzky suggested that it's  with  with respect

8 to the recipients, recipient corporations, I think that

9 there  there are many questions about the State law

10 cause of action that would need to be resolved on remand

11 if the Court were to reverse.

12             And I would just point out, on  on the

13 final page of our brief, we have the text of the veil

14 piercing  the Texas veil piercing, such that in  in

15 order  in order to prevail under that section, the

16 Petitioner is going to have to prove it says an actual

17 fraud for the direct personal benefit of the holder.

18 And so they're basically going to have to prove that

19 Mr. Ritz obtained money or property by actual fraud, in

20 order to prevail under the State law cause of action.

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So how does that

22 work in the bankruptcy case?  We say this debt can't be

23 discharged, but maybe it will turn out that it could

24 have been, depending on how  how the State law claim

25 goes?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
23 1             MS. HARRINGTON:  There's  so what happens 2 is there's an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy  3 in the larger bankruptcy proceeding itself.  And so 4 instead of having parallel litigation in State court, 5 that action was stayed when the bankruptcy petition was 6 filed.  And basically, all the action is transferred to 7 the bankruptcy court. 8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the bankruptcy 9 court will decide the question under State law? 10             MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes, yes. 11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay. 12             MS. HARRINGTON:  And the bankruptcy court 13 held that it  it wasn't satisfied in this case, 14 because the bankruptcy court viewed those Texas laws as 15 requiring a misrepresentation, and also as 523(a)(2)(a) 16 is requiring misrepresentation. 17             And so I think there  there are a lot of 18 things that would need to be sorted out about the State 19 law cause of action on remand. 20             I just want to say one last thing on 21 redundancy, if I could.  There's a couple of 22 specific provisions in 523 that the Respondent suggests 23 are redundant.  One of them is 523(a)(4), and Respondent 24 suggests that  and that's the  that covers fraud in 25 a fiduciary capacity, such that if we're correct that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
24 1 anything that would be covered by (a)(4) would  would 2 also be covered by 523(a)(2)(A). 3             But that's not correct, because 523(a)(4) is 4 not  is not limited to situations in which money or 5 property was obtained by fraud.  And so it could cover a 6 fraud where a fiduciary caused one of your properties to 7 go to a third party.  And  and so that would be 8 covered by (a)(4) and wouldn't be covered by (a)(2)(a). 9             And just in general, one last thing on 10 redundancy, I think Congress is trying to be 11 comprehensive in preventing dishonest debtors from 12 discharging their debts in bankruptcy.  And so Congress 13 used broad words like "fraud," and instead of sitting 14 down and thinking  trying to think up every different 15 fraudulent scheme that people might come up with, 16 Congress just wanted to be comprehensive and say 17 "fraud," and it uses the same word "fraud" in multiple 18 places.  That's going to create overlap.  But that's a 19 feature of the system, and not a flaw in the system. 20             Thank you. 21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 22             Ms. Murphy. 23              ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIN E. MURPHY 24                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 25             MS. MURPHY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
Alderson Reporting Company

1 please the Court:

Official

25

2             Section 523(a)(2) applies to a specific type

3 of debt, a debt for something with which the debtor has

4 fraudulently induced the creditor to part.  That

5 conclusion follows from the text of the statute for at

6 least three reasons:  First, because the statute

7 expressly says that the debt has to be for something

8 obtained by the debtor's conduct; second, because the

9 statute explicitly and repeatedly talks about forms of

10 conduct where the debtor obtains something by inducing

11 detrimental reliance; and third, because the statute

12 makes clear on its face that it's the creditor whose

13 detrimental reliance has to be induced.

14             Because Section 523(a)(2) applies only when

15 the debtor induces the creditor to part with something,

16 it does not apply to a debt for receiving money through

17 a fraudulent conveyance.  That may be a form of fraud.

18 It may well be a form of actual fraud, but it's not a

19 form of fraud that gives rise to a debt that is subject

20 to exception from discharge under 523(a)(2).

21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what  what would

22 Congress have to write to cover a scheme like this?

23             MS. MURPHY:  Well, I think 

24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You say it's not covered

25 under (a)(2).

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
26 1             MS. MURPHY:  Sure.  I think the most natural 2 way to do it would be by saying "fraudulent conveyance" 3 or "fraudulent transfer" or a "fraud that involves 4 intent to delay, defraud or  or hinder a creditor." 5 Those are the terms that Congress uses when it's 6 legislating about fraudulent conveyance, which Congress 7 has done repeatedly and pervasively for a hundred and 8 fifty years. 9             If you look at the fraudulent conveyance 10 statutes, not a single one of them uses this term 11 "actual fraud."  So this is not a term that's 12 associated, particularly with  13             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you have the 1924 14 Massachusetts statute copied from the Uniform Commercial 15 Code, which, in referring to fraudulent conveyance in 16 Section 7, uses these words:  "Each conveyance made with 17 actual intent as distinguished from intent presumed in 18 law to"  da, da, da  "hinder, delay, or defraud 19 present or future creditors is fraudulent." 20             MS. MURPHY:  Sure. 21             JUSTICE BREYER:  I grant they did use the 22 word "actual intent," rather than "actual intent to 23 hinder delay, defraud," and then they said it is 24 fraudulent.  That sounds an awful lot like the words 25 "actual fraud."
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MS. MURPHY:  And  and to be clear, we

27

2 don't dispute that fraudulent conveyance is a form of

3 actual fraud.  It's just not a form of actual fraud that

4 falls within the scope of this particular exception

5 because this exception says more than just the words

6 "actual fraud."  It says that you have to have a debt

7 for money, property, services or credit to the extent

8 obtained by false pretenses, false representations and

9 

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, a 

11             MS. MURPHY:   actual fraud.

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  The  the friend who

13 obtained the $40,000 which the friend knew was owed to

14 the creditor of the transferor has obtained money, money

15 through  it is a debt.  She owes the debt.  She now

16 owes the debt to the creditors of the transferor because

17 she has the 40,000 knowing that it's wrongly conveyed.

18 So she now owes the debt to the creditors, and her debt

19 was obtained by actual fraud.

20             MS. MURPHY:  I don't think it was.

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  Because?

22             MS. MURPHY:  Because she didn't use the

23 fraud to obtain the money.  And this gets back to what

24 you were talking about when you were giving the

25 hypothetical.  The fraud in a fraudulent conveyance is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the first debtor concealing or misrepresenting the

28

2 nature 

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true.

4             MS. MURPHY:   of the conveyance to the

5 creditor.

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  But it doesn't say 

7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We're not limited 

8             JUSTICE BREYER:  Sure.

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We're not limited to

10 fraudulent conveyances here.  You want to read the

11 statute and say something like for money obtained from

12 the innocent party in the first instance by.  And

13 that  that  but fraud can continue through 

14 through a whole chain.

15             MS. MURPHY:  Sure and  and 

16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And  and if it continues

17 through the whole chain, the person on the end of the

18 chain may have never had any relation with the innocent

19 party at all.

20             MS. MURPHY:  Well, I think that what you

21 need to have the fraud that comes within (a)(2) is

22 inducement.  Now, the inducement, the fraudulent

23 inducement, it doesn't have to be direct.  It's not our

24 position that, you know, unless the misstatement is made

25 expressly to the creditor, the debt doesn't count.  You

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 can have, you know, a misstatement that you cause to be 2 made, that the statute actually uses that language 3 causing a misrepresentation to be made that the victim 4 at the end, the creditor ultimately relies upon. 5             So we're not saying there has to be a direct 6 relationship here. 7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm totally confused 8 because I think  I was following you up until that 9 last statement. 10             MS. MURPHY:  Okay. 11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right? 12             I was following you up to when you said that 13 it has to be a debt you obtain by fraud from the person. 14             MS. MURPHY:  Yes. 15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Whether I agree with you 16 or not, that's a different issue because I'm not sure 17 that you fully answered Justice Breyer.  But I don't 18 understand where the inducement comes into this.  Why  19 why did  you can commit fraud against a person 20 directly in a variety of different ways that don't 21 require a misrepresentation.  And we know that actual 22 fraud doesn't, as a matter of fact, require a 23 misrepresentation. 24             MS. MURPHY:  Well, as far as I can tell, and 25 Petitioner hasn't suggested otherwise, there's really
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 only two forms of fraud here.  There is  there is

30

2 misrepresentation or fraudulent conveyance.  They really

3 haven't pointed to anything else.  So, you know, the

4 question, I think, really is:  Is fraudulent conveyance

5 supposed to be in this statute?  And in this particular

6 statute, I think fraudulent conveyance sticks out like a

7 sore thumb.

8             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, you just said you're

9 not contesting that fraudulent conveyance is a form of

10 actual fraud; is that right?

11             MS. MURPHY:  When it's done with intent, you

12 know, the necessary intent to make it actual fraud.  But

13 yes, that's right.

14             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, now, this language  I

15 mean, the language just seems a lot more simple than

16 you're making it, because you add inducement to the

17 language, you add from the creditor to the language.

18 But the language doesn't say any of those things.  It

19 just says is there a debt?  And we know that there is a

20 debt here.  The debt is for money.  The language says,

21 well, what has to be true of that money?  It has to be

22 obtained by actual fraud.

23             And here, the money, the allegation is, was

24 obtained by fraudulent concealment.  So whether or not

25 the creditor has been induced and whether or not the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
31 1 money has come from the creditor seems to be irrelevant 2 under this very simple statutory phrase. 3             MS. MURPHY:  I think that there is two  4 two problems with that, in our view. 5             First, I don't agree that the fraud is how 6 you obtained the money.  You obtained money, and by 7 doing so helped someone else commit a fraud on their 8 creditor.  But you did not use fraud to obtain the money 9 in a fraudulent conveyance.  You have been a participant 10 in a fraud on someone else.  So I think even  11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That leaves out every 12 conspiracy theory that exists.  I mean, if you're 13 helping someone by accepting the money, you're 14 committing a crime. 15             MS. MURPHY:  Right.  But this statute says 16 more.  It says that you have to obtain the money that is 17 what gives rise to the debt.  It's a very different  18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  A conspiracy theory says 19 you don't have to commit every act. 20             MS. MURPHY:  The  the question  21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  The transferee  the 22 transferee obtains the money by way of the fraudulent 23 conveyance, right?  How else does the transferee obtain 24 the money? 25             MS. MURPHY:  The transferee obtains the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
32 1 money through the transferor that decides to give them 2 the money, and that  3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Through a fraudulent 4 conveyance. 5             MS. MURPHY:  The fraud occurs on the back 6 end.  Because of the transfer, there is then fraud when 7 the debtor effectively, you know, either conceals the 8 transaction, that's the fraud, or conceals the true 9 nature of the transaction. 10             JUSTICE BREYER:  What about Mr. Ponzi's 11 cousin who, in fact, had nothing to do with any of the 12 misrepresentations, but knowing the entire truth says 13 Ponzi, my friend, when you get those bags of cash, hide 14 them under my bed, all right? 15             Now, he himself has not, in fact, lied to 16 anybody or made any misrepresentations, but he's part of 17 the big scheme. 18             MS. MURPHY:  Well  19             JUSTICE BREYER:  And I take it we would say 20 that that money under the bed has been obtained by 21 actual fraud, hasn't it? 22             MS. MURPHY:  Not by him. 23             JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, so you're going to get 24 him off, too. 25             MS. MURPHY:  I mean, I'm not quite sure in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 your hypothetical, where, you know 

33

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  There was  I mean, you

3 know, there are dozens and dozens of cases where 

4 where people do have misrepresentations.  There is no

5 doubt there's a misrepresentation in this thing.  But

6 after all, not every participant in the great scheme

7 himself lies.

8             MS. MURPHY:  Sure.  But 

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  And those people, I would

10 think, would  you would expect to have fall within 

11 since they're part of the big Ponzi scheme, they would

12 be right within this statute and their debts would not

13 be forgiven 

14             MS. MURPHY:  Well 

15             JUSTICE BREYER:   because they weren't the

16 ones who lied.

17             MS. MURPHY:  (a) just  it's not a

18 conspiracy statute.  And Petitioner themselves, they

19 offer as their example something that doesn't fall

20 within (a)(2), aiding and abetting somebody else's

21 fraud.  So they  they say that this is one of the ways

22 in which this statute  you know, they have to give

23 some theories as to what narrows this statute so that it

24 doesn't completely swallow the additional fraud

25 provisions that Congress has added here.  And that's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
34 1 part of their theory, is that, you know, you do have to 2 have used the fraud to obtain it yourself. 3             But I think that part of it is that you 4 can't just look at the term "actual fraud" in isolation, 5 just as the other side agrees that you can't look at the 6 term "false representation" in isolation.  Because they 7 assume that false representation means fraudulent 8 misrepresentation.  That's not what the statute says, 9 and that's not what false representation means at common 10 law. 11             At common law, false representation includes 12 negligent misrepresentation and innocent 13 misrepresentation.  If you look at the Restatement in 14 1976, it expressly says that.  So does Prosser.  So 15 they're agreeing that you can't just take these terms 16 and pluck them out of the statute and say, oh, what did 17 it mean at common law?  That's the end of the analysis. 18 The question is, what did these terms mean in this 19 statute?  And when you look at this statute, Congress 20 put the term "actual fraud" next to a bunch of terms 21 that by their nature speak of inducement. 22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it would be a very 23 strange thing, Ms. Murphy, if  if I agreed with you, 24 if I were Congress and I said, I want to make it really 25 clear that this should be only intentional, false
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 pretenses and false representation.  There are a

35

2 gazillion ways to do that, but starting with the simple

3 one, saying intentional false pretenses and an

4 intentional false representation.

5             But the one thing I wouldn't do, I think, is

6 to say actual fraud.  Because actual fraud is not

7 synonymous with  with intent.  Actual fraud refers

8 to  to conduct that's done with a certain kind of

9 intent.  And that conduct, as you just said, includes

10 more than false representation and false pretenses.

11             So I wouldn't use a term that had to do with

12 conduct just to state a mens rea requirement.

13             MS. MURPHY:  So  so here's why  and two

14 responses as to why I don't think it's actually that

15 unusual in this context.  I mean, first of all, this

16 isn't a theory that we concocted after the fact.  The

17 sponsors of the bill, when they introduced this

18 legislation on the House and Senate floor, both of the

19 key sponsors said what Subsection (a) was intended to

20 do, and I quote, "It was intended to codify current case

21 law, e.g., Neal v. Clark, interpreting fraud as actual

22 or intentional fraud rather than implied fraud."

23             But if they 

24             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if I have that case

25 right, that case is actually a case about a fraudulent

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 conveyance.  It's not a case about a false

36

2 representation.  So they said, look at this case.  It's

3 a case about a fraudulent conveyance that suggests that

4 there's more fraud in the world than just

5 misrepresentations.  And we want to make clear that

6 that's going  that that's supposed to be a part of

7 this.

8             MS. MURPHY:  That's ignoring the second half

9 of what the sponsor said, because they didn't say, we

10 intend this to codify Neal v. Clark, period.

11             And Neal v. Clark didn't hold that

12 fraudulent conveyance was something that comes within

13 the scope of the statute.  It held that the fraudulent

14 conveyance there did not come within the scope of the

15 statute 

16             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Whatever 

17             MS. MURPHY:   because 

18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Whatever may have been

19 said in  in the course of the legislative history, the

20 statute says "or."  And I think you would concede that

21 your reading requires converting "or" into "by"; that

22 is, misrepresentation, false pretenses by actual fraud.

23             MS. MURPHY:  I think that's a fair

24 statement, but I think that this case is pretty

25 analogous to the McNally case where this Court also had

37 1 the disjunctive "or" before it in interpreting the Mail 2 Fraud Statute.  And in that case the Court  it was a 3 very similar situation where you had a statute that was 4 on the books, you had decisions from this Court 5 interpreting that statute, and then Congress added to 6 the statute language that was mirroring the language of 7 this Court's cases. 8             And in that circumstance, the Court said, 9 you know what, we have to look at that language in light 10 of the fact that they took it from our cases. 11             And here, if you look at the  the cases 12 that they took this language from, they are cases that 13 use actual fraud to distinguish intentional fraud from 14 constructive fraud.  They are not cases that use actual 15 fraud to say, oh, here's what kind of fraud counts under 16 this statute, fraudulent conveyance. 17             In fact, the only cases that happen to 18 involve fraudulent conveyance and the term "actual 19 fraud" are cases where the Court held that the debt did 20 not fall within the scope of the exception to discharge. 21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you have any other 22 example in all of the U.S. Code where the word and 23 series of words A, or B, or C, and "or" is taken to mean 24 "by," and refer not to a discrete category, but modifies 25 the earlier category.

38 1             MS. MURPHY:  I'm not sure I have an example 2 where it would  you know, where  where it quite 3 works like that.  But what I would say is that there are 4 many places in the U.S. Code where an item that comes at 5 the end of or later in a list is used to inform the 6 meaning of the word before it.  And if you look at Neal 7 v. Clark itself, that's exactly the reasoning the Court 8 employed there. 9             The reason the Court concluded that the only 10 kind of fraud that counted was intentional fraud was 11 because the next item in the list was embezzlement.  And 12 the Court said because embezzlement requires intent, 13 we're going to infer from that term that fraud requires 14 intent as well. 15             So the basic principle that adding language 16 to a statute can inform and limit the words that come 17 before it is nothing that extraordinary.  It's just  18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can you give me an 19 example in common parlance, not  not in the U.S. Code, 20 where someone would speak along the lines you're saying 21 the statute is written? 22             MS. MURPHY:  Sure.  There's an example in a 23 statutory construction book of the phrase "cats, dogs, 24 or domesticated animals."  When you're thinking about 25 that phrase, "domesticated animals" is the one that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
39 1 tells you cats doesn't include lions and tigers.  And 2 it's given in the context of  3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's not great  4             MS. MURPHY:   the veterinarian says, you 5 know, I will treat these three types of animals.  It's 6 limiting the one that comes before it. 7             I think another phrase that I came across 8 was highways, bridges, and public sidewalks.  You know, 9 "public sidewalks" is what tells you that bridges 10 doesn't include the one in my backyard.  So the third 11 term can be a term that informs the meaning.  Now, here 12 I'm  I don't think you have to conclude that that's 13 the only thing "actual fraud" achieves in this statute 14 in order to accept our reading of the statute. 15             "Actual fraud" in this statute  you know, 16 the concept of misrepresentation doesn't have to be 17 completely synonymous with the concept of false 18 representation.  What you can essentially view "actual 19 fraud" as doing is putting a thumb on the scale of the 20 broadest conception of misrepresentation possible, even 21 if that's broader than the common law tort of false 22 misrepresentation. 23             So one thing that some courts have said when 24 looking at this statute is that it's not clear that 25 false representation reached future looking, you know,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 statements about whether I intend to perform in the

40

2 future.  And some courts have said, well, you know, we

3 don't need to resolve that debate anymore because now

4 that the statute says "actual fraud," that's good enough

5 to tell us that the kinds of misrepresentations that

6 come within the scope of this statute include any kind

7 of misrepresentation that induces the creditor to part

8 with something, even if it might not technically have

9 qualified as false representation at common law.

10             So I think that there's plenty of ways for

11 this term to do work without having it kind of put this

12 sore thumb into the statute of fraudulent conveyance,

13 which is just nothing like the rest of the terms in this

14 statute.

15             It's nothing like false statements, false

16 representations, false financial statements.  All of

17 those types of conduct that this statute has always

18 covered involve inducing the creditor to part with

19 something.  And that's what differentiates (a)(2) from

20 the 18 other exceptions in the statute.

21             This is not the intentional fraud provision.

22 There's plenty of other provisions in the statute that

23 cover forms of intentional fraud, some of them by

24 directly using the word "fraud," others like (a)(6) by

25 covering intentional injuries to property interests.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             So it's not as if you need to put this

41

2 remedy into (a)(2) in order to ensure that if you really

3 do have intentional fraud in the receipt of a fraudulent

4 conveyance, there will be a means of having a debt

5 that's nondischargeable.  So I don't know why you kind

6 of strain to get it in here where it seems like such a

7 poor fit.

8             And the other thing that I think is worth

9 keeping note of is that Congress has legislated, quite

10 specifically, on fraudulent conveyance for 150 years.

11 And there are two things that you can note repeatedly

12 when Congress does so.

13             First of all, it uses particular language

14 of  of fraudulent convenance.  It talks about a

15 fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer, or a

16 transfer made with intent to injure, hinder, delay, or

17 defraud a creditor.

18             But the other thing is that the remedies

19 Congress has created for fraudulent conveyance are not

20 creditorspecific.  They are instead consistent with the

21 basic principle of equitable distribution.

22             Under 727(a)(2), you have a complete bar to

23 discharge which benefits everybody because no debtor

24 gets a discharge.

25             Under 548(a)(1) and the other provisions

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
42 1 that allow the trustee to void transactions, the money 2 comes back to the estate and then gets distributed 3 equitably to all creditors. 4             Here, instead, you have a creditor who's 5 basically jumping the line and saying we should get all 6 of this money, even though within the context of the 7 Chrysalis bankruptcy, the trustee did not see fit to try 8 to void these transactions, and there was no attempt by 9 the trustee to void transactions in this bankruptcy, 10 either. 11             So you end up with a remedy that is really 12 nothing like the ones that Congress has offered when it 13 is actually legislating clearly on the topic of 14 fraudulent transfers  15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know that that 16 moves me that much. 17             Does that mean that if you're a  if you've 18 accepted a fraudulent amount of money, you get to keep 19 it? 20             MS. MURPHY:  Absolutely not, because  21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's what you're 22 saying  23             MS. MURPHY:  No, I'm not.  Because the 24 trustee's powers allow them to void the transaction and 25 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
43 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But if they choose not 2 to, that still means you get to keep it. 3             MS. MURPHY:  Well  4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That one creditor has  5             MS. MURPHY:  The creditor has the ability to 6  7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   the expense, et 8 cetera. 9             MS. MURPHY:   try and get the trustee to 10 void the transaction, and the trustee can void the next 11 transaction on down the line as well.  The statutory 12 powers include, you know, if  if the recipient then 13 fraudulently conveys away the property, you can keep 14 undoing the transfers until you ultimately get at the 15 property.  So there's plenty of ability for the trustee 16 to get at the property without resorting to this. 17             Now, we're not saying that there can never 18 be a creditorspecific remedy for the receipt of a 19 fraudulent conveyance.  If, say, you have a trustee who 20 has that debt against the recipient, I think the right 21 thing for them to do is to go use the Subsection (a)(6) 22 exception, which allows an exception for willful and 23 malicious injury to the property interests of another. 24             And courts have  every court that's looked 25 at that question has said that (a)(6) is an appropriate
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 place for this kind of debt to be accepted from

44

2 discharge.  So you've got courts who have looked at this

3 question and said 

4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What does it take to

5 show  what is it, the phrase "malicious," or what?

6             MS. MURPHY:  "Willful and malicious 

7             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Oh.

8             MS. MURPHY:   injury to" 

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   what  what does it

10 take to show that?

11             MS. MURPHY:  So it can be either subjective

12 intent to cause injury, or it can be a substantial

13 certainty that injury will result.  There's a bit

14 of dispute below in the  in the courts of appeals

15 about whether an objective substantial certainty that

16 harm will result is sufficient, or you need a subjective

17 substantial certainty.

18             I'm not sure, at the end of the day, that

19 ever is an outcome determinative distinction.

20             But for this case, it makes no difference at

21 all, because the Fifth Circuit is the circuit that

22 applies the broader objective test.  And applying that

23 objective text here, the Fifth Circuit concluded, as did

24 the two courts below, that these transfers were not made

25 with intent to injure the Petitioner, and were not even

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 made with substantial certainty that injury to the

45

2 Petitioner 

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's your case.

4             MS. MURPHY:   would result.

5             JUSTICE BREYER:  And I'm still  as Justice

6 Sotomayor said, seemed to me there is a  look what

7 you're saying here.  The bankrupt or insolvent person

8 transfers the jewels to his wife.  Okay?  And now what

9 this would be saying under their reading is the jewels

10 survive her bankruptcy, and quite right, that her

11 husband's trustee could have clawed it back before, but

12 he didn't.  And so now it went through her bankruptcy,

13 and if it survives, somebody can get it.

14             And  and maybe the fair thing to do is to

15 do what you do with environmental cases or you have a

16 bunch of people who are victims and they divide it up,

17 because you're quite right, that all of the creditors

18 who might have shared in the jewels are the victims, the

19 creditors of the transferor.  But so what?  I mean, how

20 does  how does that help you with your basic argument?

21 It just  it's a different argument that says that this

22 particular creditor shouldn't get all of it.

23             MS. MURPHY:  Well, I think it's actually

24 kind of true in every fraudulent conveyance case because

25 typically the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE BREYER:  It's also true in every

46

2 misrepresentation case.  If it survives bankruptcy 

3             MS. MURPHY:  Not at all.  No, it's

4 absolutely not true.  In a misrepresentation case, the

5 misrepresentation was made to the creditor.  So the

6 creditor  the debt that the creditor is trying to get

7 the money for is directly related to inducing that

8 creditor to part with the money.

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  So he does, perhaps, to a

10 thousand.  He lied to a thousand people.

11             MS. MURPHY:  Well, then each one of them 

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  There are a thousand

13 victims.  And here we have, let's say, a thousand

14 victims, all those creditors who didn't get the money

15 they should have gotten.  I mean, it's the same problem,

16 isn't it?

17             MS. MURPHY:  I  I don't think it is

18 because in that context you have a creditorspecific

19 injury and a creditorspecific remedy, and I think you

20 need that, too, in the fraudulent conveyance context.

21             So if, for instance, you know, the jewels

22 belonged to one of the creditors, then they're going to

23 go use (a)(6) and get the jewels back.  They're not

24 going to have a problem.  (a)(6) is available for that

25 intentional injury to their property 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE BREYER:  I see.

47

2             MS. MURPHY:   interest.

3             So you don't need it over here when you have

4 a very different statute that has been focused on this

5 concept of inducement.  And I would note here, every

6 single one of this Court's cases that involved (a)(2)

7 has always had a debtor who is using fraud to induce the

8 creditor to part with something.  That's the way this

9 statute had been understood up until the Seventh

10 Circuit's decision came along and  and had this new

11 idea that you could get at fraudulent conveyance through

12 this statute.

13             Before that, it was pretty commonly

14 understood that what (a)(2) was about, that

15 differentiated it from other provisions, was that it was

16 about fraudulent inducement.  And that's the ultimate

17 problem here.  They may have a debt.  They may have a

18 debt that even involves actual fraud, but they don't

19 have a debt for anything with which Petitioner was ever

20 fraudulently induced to part resulting in my client

21 obtaining anything by the kind of fraud that counts

22 under 5  Section 523(a)(2).

23             If there are no further questions.

24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

2           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORESTZKY

3                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4             MR. DVORETZKY:  Thank you.

5             A veterinarian's office with a sign saying

6 that the veterinarian treats dogs, cats or domesticated

7 animals treats more than just dogs and cats.  Surely

8 that office will also treat guinea pigs and hamsters.

9 And so the "domesticated animals" phrase does have

10 something in common with dogs and cats, just as

11 "fraudulent transfers" has something in common with

12 false pretenses and false representations.

13             These are all schemes to cheat creditors.

14 But by adding "or actual fraud," Congress was expanding

15 upon the preexisting terms, expanding upon dogs and

16 cats to cover something additional.

17             Respondent does not have any theory for what

18 Congress was doing through this language to expand upon

19 the previous terms.

20             With respect to false representation, courts

21 had unanimously interpreted false representations to

22 refer to the tort of deceit.  In his brief, Respondent

23 equates false representations with the tort of deceit.

24 Even if false representations might have been understood

25 as something else, adding "or actual fraud" would not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
49 1 narrow false representations to exclude unintentional  2 unintentional representations.  It would at best simply 3 show that you could also have a discharge bar for an 4 intentional misrepresentation. 5             With respect to Neal, Neal has to be 6 understood in light of what was at issue at  in that 7 case.  The  the fundamental premise of Neal was that 8 some forms of fraudulent transfers are fraud under the 9 predecessor of Section 523(a)(2)(A).  And so the only 10 reason that the Court drew a line there between 11 "intentional" and "unintentional" participation was on 12 the premise that if the participation had been 13 intentional, that would have been nondischargeable 14 fraud. 15             With respect to the statutory text here, 16 nothing about the statute talks about inducing a 17 creditor to part with anything.  It simply talks about 18 obtaining money by fraud.  And for the reasons that I 19 explained earlier, a transferee commits fraud and, 20 therefore, incurs a new debt for which he is liable if 21 he knowingly participates in a fraudulent transfer. 22             Ms. Murphy made the point that there  23 suggested that there's something anomalus about allowing 24 creditors to pursue a fraudulent transfer remedy for the 25 benefit of an individual creditor.  There's nothing
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 anomalus about that.  State fraudulent transfer laws

50

2 exist outside of bankruptcy, and so before the

3 bankruptcy stay takes effect, it is essentially a

4 freeforall where creditors can pursue their rights

5 under State fraudulent transfer laws.

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  We  we treat  we treat

7 in our veterinarian clinic domestic animals, your 

8 domestic animals or your household  domestic animals,

9 your dog  your  your favorite friends or your

10 domestic pets, you see.  Domestic pets is meant to say

11 which domestic animals?  Domestic animals, dogs, cats,

12 or household pets?  Domestic animals seems to cover the

13 whole thing.  They're saying, or it's like, i.e.,

14 household pets.

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Come on and answer 

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, not for you.  I mean,

17 it's good for you, this word "or."

18             (Laughter.)

19             JUSTICE BREYER:  I grant you, I've had a

20 horrible time trying to find an example.

21             But  but it could be it means i.e.  She's

22 saying it means i.e., household pets.

23             MR. DVORETZKY:  Not when Congress adds "or

24 domestic animals" as a specific amendment.  That has to

25 be given some effect.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
51 1             Lastly, (a)(6) doesn't solve this problem. 2 If (a)(6) simply covered any intentional wrong, it would 3 simply subsume all of the discharge bars.  Any 4 intentional misrepresentation would fall within (a)(6). 5 (a)(6) has to be given a narrower construction in order 6 to differentiate it from the other bars. 7             Moreover, (a)(6) doesn't apply in Chapter 8 13.  In particularly in 2005 when Congress reformed 9 Chapter 13 to crack down on fraud, it did not mean to 10 allow the sort of scheme that went on in this case or 11 the sort of fraudulent transfer that Justice Breyer 12 hypothesized to  to lead to a discharge. 13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you limiting actual 14 frauds to just fraudulent conveyances?  Are there other 15 deceptive schemes that you would include? 16             MR. DVORETZKY:  There are.  I think the 17 Heartland usage of "actual fraud" at common law, most 18 commonly it did refer to fraudulent transfers to hinder 19 creditors.  There were  may I answer? 20             There were also other types of conveyances, 21 conveyances to defeat a divorcing spouse's interest, for 22 example, the devastatit in Neal to diminish an estate. 23 We also give an example in our brief of undue influence. 24 These are also forms of actual fraud, but the Heartland 25 of it is fraudulent conveyances.
