1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:03 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in Case 06-1322, Federal Express Corporation v. 5 Holowecki. 6 Ms. Lensing. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CONNIE L. LENSING 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MS. LENSING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 Congress clearly set out a statutory scheme 12 in which timely notice and the opportunity for 13 conciliation are required before an age discrimination 14 private suit may be brought. While our position is that 15 reading -- the reading of ADEA Section 626(d) as a whole 16 shows that "charge" encompasses notice, even if that 17 definition is too broad and you accept only a content 18 definition of "charge," it is clear from the structure 19 of the statute that notice and an opportunity to 20 conciliate before a lawsuit commences is required. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, EEOC Form 5 is 22 labelled "Charge." And would it be your position that 23 if an employee filled out that form and submitted it to 24 the EEOC, but the EEOC made a mistake and did not notify 25 the employer, that that would not be a charge?

1 MS. LENSING: We think the better rule is

2 that it would not be a charge until notice is given,

3 because that's the only rule that is faithful to the

4 statute, that notice is required. But equitable tolling

5 is available for such a mistake and that's the exact

6 situation in which equitable tolling should be used, to

7 rectify a true mistake on the EEOC's part at the time,

8 rather than what they have been engaging in of late,

9 which is second-guessing the decision made at the time.

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why don't we do

11 exactly that here? I mean, you say that the proper

12 thing to do, now a charge labelled Form 5 has been

13 filed, is to dismiss this lawsuit; and then we wait 60

14 days; and the identical lawsuit is reinstated.

Why

15 shouldn't the court simply toll the case and say, now we

16 have a proper Form 5. The employer didn't get a chance

17 to engage in settlement. So we hold on to the case and

18 allow the 60 days to elapse, and then the complaint is

19 there. Why isn't that the appropriate solution for this

20 case?

21 MS. LENSING: Well, Justice Ginsburg, to

22 begin with, the plaintiff never requested that the court

23 do that. But in a broader sense, it's not the proper

24 thing to do because there's a very big difference in

25 conciliation after notification and before a lawsuit has

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 been filed. There is -- the emphasis is on let's get 2 this conciliated, if possible. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said the same 4 complaint could be filed at the end of the conciliation. 5 What difference does it make that you have a piece of 6 paper there? 7 What I don't understand is the only effect 8 of your position -- dismiss the whole thing, 60 days, 9 start over -- is you're making the plaintiff file an 10 additional filing fee. The complaint has already been 11 filed. The filing fee has been paid. 12 Now, everything would work out just the same 13 except the plaintiff has to pay a second filing fee. In 14 the court there are certain inefficiencies if it's first 15 dismissed and then they have to docket it again. So I 16 don't see any -- it doesn't seem to make any sense to 17 me. 18 MS. LENSING: Well, Congress believed that 19 notice and a chance to conciliate without a lawsuit was 20 the proper way for this to be done, and there is a 21 difference in efforts to conciliate before and after a 22 lawsuit is filed. And if -23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think -- I 24 think you're right about that. I mean, once the 25 lawyer's involved and they're in litigation and all
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that, they're not going to take conciliation efforts 2 with the same light as before. 3 But the question is whether the remedy for 4 that, which is some unfairness to you, is to throw the 5 suit out or try to fix it as much as possible, such as 6 through a stay or dismissing without prejudice or 7 something. 8 Why should the Plaintiff -- it's not his 9 fault that the EEOC didn't notify you. Why should he 10 suffer the categorical sanction of dismissal simply 11 because it's a little unfairness to you? 12 MS. LENSING: I think it could be dismissed 13 without prejudice. I think that that's fine, because 14 then you would have an opportunity, as in this case 15 where there is a proper charge, to have that period of 16 conciliation, and the plaintiff would not be out 17 anything other than the filing fee, which the employer 18 is out a little bit, too, because the employer never got 19 a prompt notice at the time of the first situation. 20 But the biggest reason -21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why should the -22 the filing fee penalty, in effect, go to the plaintiff 23 when it wasn't the plaintiff's fault? 24 MS. LENSING: Well, you know, I would submit 25 that perhaps it is the plaintiff's fault when the
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 plaintiff does not do everything a plaintiff can to be 2 sure that a charge is filed. This particular form, for 3 instance, stated that it is for -- pre-charge counseling 4 is the purpose, and that it's to determine potential 5 charges. 6 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I interrupt you to this 7 extent: As I understand it, if -- your position, if the 8 plaintiff had filed on Form 5 and the EEOC had done 9 nothing and the plaintiff then brought suit, you'd be 10 making the same argument. 11 MS. LENSING: That is true, and equitable 12 tolling is available. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that. I 14 mean, that -- that seems to me a very strange argument. 15 You say since -- since the EEOC must give notice when a 16 charge is filed, if it doesn't give notice, no charge 17 has been filed. 18 That doesn't make sense. I mean, it's just 19 like saying, you know, you have a civil rule, a rule of 20 civil procedure, that says, you know, after a complaint 21 has been filed there shall be an answer within 60 days. 22 And if no answer is filed, no complaint has been filed? 23 MS. LENSING: Well, Justice -- sorry. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it just doesn't 25 track.

1 MS. LENSING: Justice Scalia, I understand 2 your hesitancy to accept our definition of "charge" as 3 including notice, but the other view -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: So give me another one that 5 will enable me to rule in your favor? 6 MS. LENSING: It is -- it is just as true 7 and the results are just the same if you look at the 8 statute as a whole and you uphold the sense of the 9 statute and you understand that the requirement before 10 bringing a suit, whether or not notice is part of the 11 definition of "charge." But there is a requirement 12 under the statute that notice and an effort to 13 conciliate be made before the suit is brought. So 14 understanding the statute as a whole and upholding that 15 purpose, that it's a requirement, an indispensable 16 prerequisite to a lawsuit, is a different way of getting 17 to the same result. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Now, does -19 does the person who's filed a proper charge know whether 20 notice has been given or not? Is a copy of the notice 21 always given to the filer. 22 MS. LENSING: I don't know if it always is. 23 Certainly when it's not given, it is not. But, yes, I 24 think the person easily can contact or find out from the 25 EEOC, what is happening with my, what she believes or
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 may not believe is a charge. In this particular case, 2 certainly she did within the time limits because she 3 filed a charge later. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: After she had a lawyer. 5 But is it -- is it not the practice at the EEOC when 6 you're dealing with an unrepresented person who files 7 the intake questionnaire and if the SEC reviewer thinks 8 that it fits within the statute, that the Form 5 will be 9 filled out, not by the layperson, but by the EEOC 10 officer herself? 11 MS. LENSING: Well, I think that the, the 12 practice has been so inconsistent and that's part of the 13 problem. Two field agents in this particular case, one 14 in '01 and one in '02, because she submitted the 15 questionnaire twice, two field agents did decide that it 16 was not a charge and did not treat it as a charge -- no 17 charge number, no notice. They decided it was not a 18 charge. And so no Form 5 -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not the 20 question. The question I asked is if they decide that 21 the, what the intake -- the information on the intake 22 questionnaire fits within the statute so that the claim 23 can go forward, isn't it the practice not to ask the 24 layperson to fill out the Form 5, but for the EEOC to do 25 it itself?

1 MS. LENSING: I don't believe so, Your 2 Honor. The website says, for instance, until 2 months 3 ago -- for 2-1/2 years the Web site, which is probably 4 the way the agency gets out information to more people 5 and more employees than any other way, says when the 6 completed signed Form 5 is received back in the field 7 office -8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it has to be 9 signed. 10 MS. LENSING: Well, this -- right. Received 11 back in the field office -- in this case, for instance, 12 both the questionnaire and the charge were filled out by 13 her, by the, by the employee. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, she filled out hers 15 after she was already in court and had a lawyer. But I 16 thought that this statute, as all the statutes EEOC 17 administers, are designed for claims that are put forth 18 initially largely by unrepresented people. And the 19 notion is that the agency should make it as easy as 20 possible for them to get through the legal process. 21 MS. LENSING: It -- the form does say, the 22 form that she filled out, the intake questionnaire, does 23 say that someone will talk with you after you fill this 24 out. It does not say that they will fill out the 25 charge. In our experience the charge is very often
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 filled out by the employee. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: It said it wasn't a charge, 3 didn't it? Didn't it say that it's not a charge? 4 MS. LENSING: Yes, it did. Well, it did not 5 say that this is not a charge, which I think would be a 6 better practice if it did say that in the future. But 7 it said the purpose of this is for precharge 8 counseling -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Precharge counseling. 10 MS. LENSING: -- and for determination 11 whether we have jurisdiction over potential charges. So 12 we think the plain language of the form -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we know -14 perhaps this is a question your friend on the other side 15 will be able to answer better than you. But do we know 16 where she got the form, why she filled it out? I 17 couldn't find in the record whether this was given to 18 her by someone at the EEOC or whether she downloaded it 19 from the website or what. 20 MS. LENSING: We do not know, or I do not 21 know. It is not in the record. You're correct. 22 The problem is, is that the practice at EEOC 23 has been so inconsistent, both the, what they call a 24 charge, what they recognize as a charge, and their 25 treatment of documents as a charge. Again, the Web site
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 clearly says a Form 5 that is signed and completed and 2 received back in the field office is a charge. That is 3 when your charge is filed. And yet we have two memos 4 that went out, one after the Edelman case and one after 5 the opening brief in this case, to field agents that 6 say, no, you're supposed to use this manifest intent 7 test. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I agree completely 9 with everything you said. I just don't understand your 10 leap from government incompetence to saying the 11 plaintiff loses. 12 MS. LENSING: The plaintiff does not lose. 13 And that is the difference in this situation and the 14 Logan case, which the government, I think, and also the 15 Respondent have cited. The plaintiff does not lose, 16 because equitable tolling is available. Now, in our 17 case -18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What happens -- what 19 happens if -- in this case it's not a problem, but I can 20 imagine it would be in many cases -- - if you have a 21 300-day or a 180-day problem, you withdraw the 22 complaint, and then you're out there and the clock keeps 23 ticking, and you get past the 300 days and you are 24 totally out. That's why it's important not to follow -25 to say, well, it's, it doesn't make any difference, if
12

1 we dismiss this complaint, she comes back in 60 days. 2 Well, but 60 days may be 360 days. 3 MS. LENSING: Yes, Your Honor. That's where 4 equitable tolling comes in. That's the purpose of 5 equitable tolling. 6 If the situation is that you have missed the 7 time to file the charge, either the 180 or the 300 days, 8 equitable tolling saves from you that. In other words, 9 you can now file the charge. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think 11 Ms. Kennedy is entitled to equitable tolling in this 12 case? 13 MS. LENSING: Ms. Kennedy didn't need 14 equitable tolling, because in this case she caught the 15 situation before the time ran and she filed a charge. 16 The problem in this case is that she chose not to file a 17 lawsuit based on that charge, and she decided to do that 18 for quite some time. She did finally get -- you know, 19 once the charge was filed, the EEOC recognized it as a 20 charge, they gave notice to us, the employer. They 21 began the time -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess she, 23 reasonably or otherwise, thought there already was a 24 lawsuit. 25 MS. LENSING: Well, not after the lawsuit
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 was dismissed, Your Honor. I mean after the lawsuit was 2 dismissed, she got the right to sue letter and she still 3 did not bring a lawsuit. She had 90 days from the right 4 to sue letter and she still did not bring a lawsuit. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't she appealing? 6 MS. LENSING: Pardon me? 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't she appealing the 8 dismissal? 9 MS. LENSING: Yes, Your Honor. 10 But, you know, the equitable tolling is not 11 needed where you file within the 180 or 300 days. All 12 you have to do is file a -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did you undertake 14 conciliation efforts after her formal, her filing of the 15 Form 5 charge? 16 MS. LENSING: We were in a lawsuit, Your 17 Honor, and so that sort of changes everything. We 18 can't, we can't talk to her. We can't -- you know, the 19 discovery process is what you then would use to 20 investigate, rather than an informal investigation. And 21 that never occurred and that's part of the problem here, 22 because we spent a long, long time on the motion to 23 dismiss. It was finally dismissed. Then it was on 24 appeal, and it's still on appeal. So we haven't had 25 that opportunity, although she is a current employee;
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that this has been in litigation, and that changes the 2 face of conciliation completely. 3 JUSTICE ALITO: If the employee files an 4 intake questionnaire but not a Form 5, would you say 5 that there would be equitable tolling, or would you say 6 that the employee wouldn't be entitled to equitable 7 tolling because the employee didn't file the right form? 8 MS. LENSING: I think that unless she was 9 relying on the EEOC, and there have been cases like that 10 in which the EEOC says, the field agent says, that's all 11 you need to do, this is a charge and notice is going to 12 issue. If that were -- if there were some evidence of 13 that in the record, which of course this record is 14 completely silent. The plaintiff chose to put no 15 information in about whether she believed, didn't 16 believe or what she was relying on. But in a situation 17 where the EEOC misleads her, yes. I would certainly say 18 no in a situation where the form clearly says that it's 19 precharge. 20 JUSTICE ALITO: I don't see much difference 21 between the substance of these two forms, other than the 22 fact that the Form 5, I think, requires a listing of the 23 number of employees that the employer has. What -- they 24 basically cover the same ground. 25 MS. LENSING: There is very little
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 difference, you're exactly right, in the information 2 requested. The difference is that one is an intake 3 questionnaire and not a charge, and the other is a 4 charge. And the EEOC, which we think is a good idea, 5 has had a multistep process, so that lay people that 6 come in and say, you know, I have this charge of 7 discrimination, it happened to me when I was working in 8 France, they can go through those and say that's not, 9 that's not a charge, and they can read through them and 10 not have to process everything as a charge. That's the 11 reason for the intake questionnaire. But it is simply 12 giving the information to the EEOC and not a charge, and 13 must be treated, must be treated differently. 14 You know, going back, Justice Ginsburg, 15 because I don't think I ever finished the answer to your 16 question some time ago. One of the problems with 17 staying the lawsuit is if that were the answer, then we 18 would be doing away with presuit notice, because anybody 19 could go in on an intake questionnaire a year later 20 because, remember, nothing is happening to -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I don't understand 22 that, because EEOC is a responsible agency. Congress 23 has told it: You weed out the people complaining about 24 something that happened in Paris, and then you give 25 notice. But the notice obligation -- and I understand
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 it is EEOC's, not the complainant's. So we would not 2 expect this agency -- yes, it messed up in this case -3 routinely not to give notice, routinely not to engage 4 the employer in conciliation efforts. 5 MS. LENSING: But that is the problem. If 6 you -- they are routinely not giving notice of intake 7 questionnaires, and they are not supposed to. We agree 8 with them. And twice this happened. And only 5 years 9 later after it got to this Court did the EEOC write a 10 memo and say, oh, those field agents were wrong. But we 11 need to take the opinion of the EEOC at the time. And 12 of course this was a very reliable, very justified 13 opinion of the field agents because it clearly said on 14 the form it was precharge. 15 But if you -- if you just say the lawsuit, 16 that means that anybody that files an intake 17 questionnaire can come in 2 years later because it's not 18 being processed, so no notice to sue letter will ever go 19 out, and so there is no end to the statute. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the new form, 21 the EEOC's new form -- I suppose responsive to this case 22 and others like it -- that says if you don't file any 23 other administrative complaint, we'll count the intake 24 questionnaire as the charge? 25 MS. LENSING: Well, that's -- that's an
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 interesting form because that means it you come in the 2 day after the act of discrimination, that form is filled 3 out; it is neither a complaint nor a charge. Who knows 4 what it is until 300 days run. So at the end of 300 5 days, if the -- if the complainant has not filed another 6 writing, then there -- there can be no prompt notice. 7 Then it is -- has morphed into a charge; then there can 8 be no prompt notice to the employer. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the EEOC treats it as 10 a charge, then the EEOC is obliged to give notice. 11 MS. LENSING: But they won't know if it's a 12 charge until the entire time runs, to know if it's the 13 only timely filed document, because it says it's only a 14 charge if you don't file anything else on time. You 15 have 300 days to do that. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where does it 17 say if you don't file it's only -18 MS. LENSING: If it's the only timely 19 document filed -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 21 MS. LENSING: -- means that no other 22 document within the time period, which is 300 days. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the new form. 24 MS. LENSING: In deferral stage. Yes. 25 That's the form, yes, Your Honor, the form in footnote
18

1 3, I believe, of the EEOC's brief. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And where in the form 3 that -4 MS. LENSING: I'm sorry. Footnote 2, I 5 think, on page 3. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The new form does say 7 that, that if no other paper is filed, this can be 8 treated as a charge? 9 MS. LENSING: This will be a charge, if no 10 other timely allegation of discrimination is -- is 11 filed. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't that eliminate the 13 whole purpose of the -- of the preliminary document, to 14 weed out those charges that relate to employment in 15 France? 16 MS. LENSING: It does. It does completely. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: It will -- it will be a 18 charge even if it's in France? 19 MS. LENSING: Right. It should be. Now, I 20 think the practical matter is, Justice Scalia, that if 21 nobody does anything ever -- you don't file suit, you 22 don't try to rely on it -- they don't give notice and 23 they don't -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's right. I 25 think what it boils down to is it'll be a charge if we
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 decide to give notice, and it won't be a charge if we 2 don't decide to give notice. 3 MS. LENSING: Exactly. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is very nice for the 5 EEOC, but not -6 MS. LENSING: Which can only happen at the 7 end of a long period of time, which means that the 8 notice will not be prompt. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the 10 Government relied in its brief very heavily on the 11 Chevron case, saying we should defer to the agency's 12 regulations, and on the Auer case, saying we defer to 13 the agency to tell us what its regulations mean. And 14 you didn't cite either of those cases in your reply 15 brief. So I wonder what your answer is to that 16 argument. 17 MS. LENSING: Well, the -- the regulations 18 are certainly entitled to deference, and taken as a 19 whole, the regulations, just as the statutes, require 20 notice. But what the EEOC's position is, is the 21 regulations that describe what a charge is are not 22 enough, and the entire definition is not embodied in the 23 regulations. You have to go to -- to memos we wrote and 24 to a compliance manual, which is not in the record and 25 is not attached to the brief and is not available to

LENSING: Well -7 JUSTICE BREYER: But if you're not hurt by 8 it, what difference does it make? 9 MS. LENSING: Well, I agree if we get the 10 notice, we cannot complain. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: And if you don't get it, 12 you can't complain, if you actually knew about it. 13 MS.

If, 17 for instance, a plaintiff gave us the notice and the 18 EEOC didn't -- didn't file it, I agree, because notice 19 is the important thing; but that's not what happened. 20 That is just simply not what happened. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- well, then you'd 22 have the complaint if you didn't, et cetera, but so 23 what?

Or 22 if you're not, it doesn't matter. 23 MS. LENSING: Exactly. If you're not, it 24 doesn't matter. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, all right. So what's
22

1 wrong with that? 2 MS. LENSING: Well it's -- it's the 3 situation where you are hurt that's the problem. The 4 problem is that we need a better rule that's faithful to 5 the statute, where notice is given. And -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you're only -7 when you say you're hurt, the only prejudice that you 8 rely on is the fact that you didn't have an opportunity 9 to go through prelitigation conciliation. 10 MS. LENSING: We didn't have prompt notice. 11 We could not investigate -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but my point 13 is, you're not alleging prejudice from the lack of 14 prompt notice. In other words, it's not a situation 15 where you'd say if we had notice we would have done 16 this, and that would have prevented everything. 17 MS. LENSING: Well, we don't -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your only prejudice 19 is the lack of conciliation period. 20 MS. LENSING: Well, I don't think that's the 21 only prejudice, and this is what somewhat speculatory 22 because it did not happen; but generally if you have 23 prompt notice, particularly without a lawsuit, you can 24 investigate; and if you don't have prompt notice, 25 sometimes you have destroyed documents in the regular

You have employees who are 3 witnesses who are gone; you don't know where they are. 4 You have all sorts of things that -5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know whether that's 6 true in this case? 7 MS. LENSING: Do I believe that's true in 8 this case? 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know whether -- I 10 mean the difference -- what you are suggesting would be 11 perfectly fine is once the charge was filed, and this is 12 a lawsuit, and then you would investigate or whatever, 13 but you would be under exactly the same disadvantage if 14 the time lapse has meant that employees have left, that 15 you have -- you have removed evidence as old and 16 disposable. It wouldn't -- you would -- on your 17 scenario of what would be the right way to do this 18 lawsuit, you would be -- you would suffer the same 19 disabilities in terms of documents and witnesses. 20 MS. LENSING: That is true. Had -- had 21 this -- well, the charge, the only timely charge we did 22 get notice of, and so if there had not been a lawsuit we 23 could have investigated, and you're a little bit 24 estopped from the investigation when a lawsuit is 25 pending because you've got rules of discovery and that
24

1 sort of thing. And -2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I thought you 3 said you were deprived of something else. I mean, the 4 statute provides for a conciliation process in which you 5 can talk to the employee and say, you know, what 6 happened? And you may well be able to satisfy the 7 employee with -- before -- before she lawyers up. 8 I think it's a big disadvantage to -- to 9 have no contact with the employee until there's a lawyer 10 on the other side, and you can't talk to her 11 confidentially; you can't make a conciliation notice. I 12 think that's a considerable disadvantage, and it's -13 it's a situation that the statute did not envision. 14 MS. LENSING: And I agree, Justice Scalia. 15 I think they did -- the statute did envision it because 16 it does require prompt notice. That's -- that's exactly 17 where I was going next, is it's notice for investigation 18 and the opportunity to conciliate without a lawsuit 19 pending. 20 And particularly in this suit and in many 21 others now, when you have the piggyback situation, a 22 plaintiff is in a lawsuit and others are attempting to 23 piggyback off of her charge, she may not at that point 24 feel that she can conciliate just for her -- herself; 25 but before suit, that is a very good situation.

LENSING: That's absolutely right. 7 Mr. Chief Justice, I didn't finish the 8 question you had asked me about deference in the Auer 9 case. The Auer case is an interpretation of a 10 regulation, and in this case the regulation says nothing 11 about manifest intent, and that is just a wholly new 12 situation that -13 JUSTICE SOUTER: How is it -- how is it new? 14 I thought that you argued for that test in the court of 15 appeals. 16 MS. LENSING: Well, in the court of appeals, 17 as the test had been administered by other courts which 18 required evidence -19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, didn't -- didn't your 20 brief say that was the appropriate test? 21 MS. LENSING: Because in that court we were 22 bound by precedent and that was the test, but we said -23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you -- I know you're 24 bound by precedent, but if you think it's wrong, you can 25 say it's wrong. And, as I understand, you did not say
26

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 it was wrong; you adopted it. 2 MS. LENSING: Well, we -- the manifest 3 intent test that we talked about was the one the courts 4 have used, which is the situation we were talking about, 5 where equitable tolling should occur. And that is where 6 you have, in the record, reliance on the EEOC that 7 you've done everything you need to do and this is a 8 charge. 9 That is not the case under the Second 10 Circuit's ruling, where they just say: Just look at the 11 document and if you think that she wanted you to file a 12 charge, that's enough. That's a very different intent 13 test than the other courts accept. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what is your test? 15 When is it a charge? 16 MS. LENSING: When notice -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: And don't tell me when 18 notice is given. 19 MS. LENSING: Yes, sir. Yes, Your Honor. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: My goodness. It's like 21 saying there's no complaint until an answer is filed. 22 MS. LENSING: Well -- I'm not -- and that's 23 what I'm saying -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's just not true. 25 MS. LENSING: But -- but notice is required

1 for the suit. So, while a charge may be a charge before 2 notice is given, and I understand your reluctance to 3 accept that definition, but -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, only because I'm sane. 5 (Laughter.) 6 MS. LENSING: A point well taken. 7 We still -- we still get to the same place 8 if you -- if you accept the position that notice is 9 required in the statute and suit can't be brought. 10 Maybe there is a minimal charge, but suit cannot be 11 brought on that minimal charge until notice is given, is 12 a more sane way to put it. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If she had the obligation 14 to give notice, you would have a much stronger argument, 15 but the statute places that burden on the EEOC, not on 16 the lay complainant. 17 MS. LENSING: The burden is on the EEOC, and 18 that is why there's equitable tolling. But the 19 plaintiff needs to demonstrate in the record she's done 20 everything she can. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: But there can't be 22 equitable tolling unless she has really filed a charge. 23 So sooner or later -- you cannot run away from it -24 you're going to have to give us a definition of what a 25 charge is.

And you don't give me any -- unless you want to 5 fall back on the manifest destiny rule or -6 (Laughter.) 7 MS. LENSING: No. A charge needs to clearly 8 delineate that it's a charge. And I think the EEOC 9 could do that if they knew they had to live by that, and 10 then we're perfectly happy with the EEOC defining 11 "charge" as long as they consistently define it and give 12 us notice. 13 Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the rest of 14 my time if there are no more questions. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. 16 Lensing. 17 Mr. Rose. 18 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. ROSE 19 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 20 MR. ROSE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 21 please the Court: 22 I'd like to make two points initially. And 23 I'll make them briefly, and I'll try not to re-cover the 24 ground that's been covered by a number of the questions. 25 The first major point is that the statute
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and the -- well, this has been made sort of -- the 2 statute and the regulations state that, after a charge 3 has been filed, the responsibility for sending the 4 notice and docketing the case is upon the commission. 5 It's not on the aggrieved individual. The argument that 6 a petitioner has -- the charging party, excuse me, or 7 aggrieved individual has a duty to provide notice is 8 just absolutely flatly inconsistent with the statute, as 9 Justice Scalia was just stating. 10 I want to make a second point which ha also 11 been alluded to by, I think, Justice Breyer and others. 12 The Petitioner suffered no harm from the fact Ms. 13 Kennedy filed a Form 283 rather than a Form 5, which is 14 entitled "Charge," because EEOC did not give prompt 15 notice to the defendant Federal Express, the Petitioner 16 here, on May 30th. EEOC did not send the notice of the 17 filing of the charge until sometime after August 20th, 18 2002. That is, it was more than 60 days. So that even 19 though the charge was filed and -- EEOC did absolutely 20 nothing with it. No notice. And it's in the appendix, 21 if you look at Joint Appendix 294-296. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this after the real 23 charge was filed or what everybody concedes -24 MR. ROSE: Form 5. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: The charge form.

1 MR. ROSE: The charge Form 5 was file on -2 well, she signed it on the 30th. It may have been filed 3 a couple of days later. But whatever it was, that was 4 submitted. I sent it to the EEOC by, I think, FedEx. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: But suit was pending at 6 that time. 7 (Laughter.) 8 MR. ROSE: Well, I used FedEx -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's pretty risky. 10 MR. ROSE: I used FedEx for a record because 11 I can use their tracking. Some of the tracking 12 documents are in the joint appendix. I dealt with -- I 13 dealt with FedEx in the Bost case. I call it Bost. I'm 14 not sure whether it's "BOSST" or "BOEST." He calls 15 himself Tony, so I don't know. 16 In any event -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Answer my question. Was 18 suit already filed at that point? 19 MR. ROSE: Yes, sir. Suit had been filed 20 earlier. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 22 MR. ROSE: All right, let me address your 23 question, if I may. There is a period for conciliation. 24 We have records from the EEOC which we sent copies of to 25 opposing counsel by e-mail yesterday, and perhaps we

1 should have done it earlier, that show that something 2 like 240 -- I may have the wrong number -- over 200 3 cases that were filed -- charges, excuse me, by EEO -4 filed by employees of FedEx with the EEOC. Not one had 5 been conciliated from 1997 through 2005. Not one. 6 Zero. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. I'm sorry. 247 8 during that whole period? 9 MR. ROSE: Yes. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the only number of 11 mistakes they have made; is that what you're saying? 12 MR. ROSE: No. That's the only mistakes 13 that we know that EEOC made with respect to -- I'm not 14 saying that all of them should have been served or 15 anything like that, but there were -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm astounded if that's the 17 only number of mistakes they made, from 19 -18 MR. ROSE: No, no. This is only with 19 respect to FedEx. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, with respect to FedEx. 21 MR. ROSE: And it's age claims. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. 23 MR.

1 today. 2 JUSTICE STEVENS: But are you telling us 3 stuff that's not in the record at all? Why is that 4 relevant to the argument here? 5 MR. ROSE: Well, it's relevant because this 6 is a complaint that was dismissed before any evidence 7 was taken, and therefore any set of facts that's alleged 8 in the complaint is assumed to be true for purposes of 9 its trial B motion. So there was no discovery. We 10 didn't have a chance to do any discovery. The district 11 court threw us out on a motion to dismiss. Now, it was 12 morphed into a summary judgment motion functionally, but 13 on the very limited topic of what there was. 14 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the point of these 15 statistics? To show that conciliation wouldn't have 16 done any good? Is that what you -17 MR. ROSE: Yes. And, furthermore, I cite to 18 you the fact that since -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought conciliation 20 was an important policy of the EEOC. 21 MR. ROSE: EEOC does very little within 2 22 months, Your Honor, of anything, of receipt of the 23 charge. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you want us to write 25 an opinion saying, we're not concerned with
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 conciliation? We just -2 MR. ROSE: No. I think conciliation is 3 important. I think what -- if this is treated as the 4 charge, as I think it should be, under the definition in 5 the regulation, it's -- it's in 16 --29 CFR 1626. It's 6 in 3.6 and 8(b) of that regulation. The original 7 document is a charge because it identified the 8 Respondent, identified the kind of discrimination, and 9 the person signed it. That's all that's needed under 10 the regulation. That regulation is lawful. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the person fills out 12 an intake form, checks the box that says "I do not 13 consent to have my employer notified"? 14 MR. ROSE: I think that's a question that's 15 not presented here, and I think that's a question that 16 is best -- best left to EEOC. The -- that form says on 17 it that we don't -- you don't need to let us notify. 18 There's a footnote or something. We don't -- you don't 19 need to let us -- you don't need to agree at this stage 20 -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's -- what's wrong with 22 this? Why don't I -- I mean, I do believe that the 23 thing either is a charge or isn't a charge before the 24 EEOC decides whether it's going to give notice or not. 25 It either is or isn't.
34

1 Now, what about this: It is a charge if it 2 reasonably appears to be a charge, or if you want to say 3 "manifest intent," that's okay, too. 4 Now, if you signed a document which -- which 5 says that it is a prefiling document and the purpose is 6 to discuss a future charge, it seems to me you know, or 7 ought to know, that this is not a charge. 8 And we can't run the system for people who 9 are either illiterate or don't even have friends who are 10 literate. We can't run a system that way. So I look at 11 this, and I say this is not a charge. 12 MR. ROSE: Right. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, if the EEOC chooses to 14 give notice, then I guess you could say one that's close 15 to the boundary line becomes a charge retroactively, and 16 there is -- there is no harm done. You can have the 17 counseling, and so forth. 18 But when you come in with something that 19 doesn't look like a charge, it seems to me if there is 20 no notice given and you get into the situation that is 21 here where the company has been deprived of the 22 conciliation opportunity, deprived of the opportunity to 23 preserve evidence and whatnot, it seems to me the fault 24 should lie on your client, because she filed something 25 that any reasonable person should know is not a charge.

And just let me complete it if I 5 may. 6 She had never filed a charge before. She 7 had never complained. She had tried to complain 8 internally, but she had never filed a charge before. 9 She didn't know what it was. I -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Whatever it was, this thing 11 says it's a precharge document. 12 MR. ROSE: Your Honor, it says -- if you 13 look at the two-part form, it's very small writing. 14 It's at the bottom. It doesn't say it's a precharge 15 form. It says the purpose of this questionnaire is to 16 solicit information to enable the Commission to avoid 17 mistakes. 18 And then it says routine uses, and it says 19 potential charges, complaints or allegations, and to 20 provide counseling -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is where -- you're 22 reading from where? 23 MR. ROSE: It's two -- I'm sorry. It's 265, 24 I believe, (J) 265, it's the two-page printout. And the 25 handwriting is her handwriting on the top. That's a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Xerox of her handwriting. 2 Justice Scalia, I would further add that I 3 -- she was not my client when she filled this out, as 4 this document makes clear, because she checked the box 5 "not represented." 6 By the time I asked her if she had filed a charge, 7 and she said, oh, yes, I went and got the document from 8 the EEOC, and I sent it in. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that in the record? 10 MR. ROSE: No. But -- but it is, Your Honor 11 -- this is in the complaint, the facts that are supposed 12 to be alleged. As we said in the complaint, that the 13 parties had given notice to EEOC of the overall system. 14 Incidentally, there is another Respondent 15 named Robertson, who did have a live charge and a right 16 to sue letter which was running out, which is why we 17 filed this in May rather than in June or July. 18 I also -- I think I said that EEOC did not, 19 in fact, give notice to EEOC -- to FedEx until sometime 20 after August 20th, which was much more than 60 days from 21 the filing of the charge. So -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Rose, I'm having 23 trouble figuring out -- she not only filed this intake 24 questionnaire; she also filed a lengthy affidavit. 25 MR. ROSE: Yes, sir.

1 And then I called her in January and said -2 late January, I think -- did EEOC give you a number? I 3 didn't know the difference then between a complaint -4 between a Form 5 and a Form 283. 5 It was not something -- I had been 6 practicing mostly Title VII work, but I had had some age 7 cases before then. And I didn't know the difference in 8 the forms. 9 And I had a form on my computer that I had 10 people fill out which says "charge," but -- so she -- I 11 said they must have lost it. Why don't you go down 12 and -- she said, well, I'll file it again. I said fine. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You were 14 representing her at that point? 15 MR. ROSE: By February, I -- I don't think 16 we had the retainer, but I had talked to her, and I -17 and she signed the retainer either in late January or 18 early February. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you think -- why do 20 you think they must have lost it? Why did you think 21 they must have lost it: Because she hadn't been given a 22 number? 23 MR. ROSE: Yes. Because it hadn't been 24 docketed. It's like a clerk. They -- you -- it's 25 similar to what the courts -- the courts do. They get a
39
Alderson Reporting Company

1 new thing, and they docket it. The problem with EEOC 2 is, when they get a new thing that's not a Form 5, they 3 don't docket it. This didn't get docketed. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even if they treat it as a 5 charge, they don't docket it? 6 MR. ROSE: I don't know when they docketed 7 the form, the Form 5, that she filed. But the timing 8 suggests they did not docket it until August, sometime 9 after August. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: I really think the problem 11 here is the EEOC, rather than anybody else. 12 MR. ROSE: I think that's exactly right, 13 Your Honor. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: It does, indeed, have this 15 form which says -- which says that its purpose -16 information provided on this form will be used by 17 Commission employees to determine the existence of the 18 facts relevant to a decision as to whether the 19 Commission has jurisdiction and to provide such 20 precharge filing counseling, blah, blah, blah. 21 All of that, however, is contained as part 22 of the Privacy Act statement. 23 MR.

ROSE: I'm sorry, Your Honor? 10 JUSTICE BREYER: What I think Miss Lensing, 11 one of her more basic points is this: There is a 12 statute. And the statute says the EEOC shall send 13 prompt notice in part to the conciliation. And she 14 adds, if we get the notice, we also start getting 15 evidence and preserving it and talking to people. There 16 are a lot of things they would like to do with that 17 notice. 18 MR. ROSE: Sure. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I replied to that, 20 well, okay, they complain about the lack of notice. But 21 her response is, sure, they sometimes don't give notice 22 when they file a charge. That's just a mistake. But if 23 you start calling these documents charges, well, they 24 never give notice, so they will never do it. It will be 25 a big problem, so, therefore, don't call them charges.

1 Now, I want to know what your answer is to 2 the first part of what I said. My -- I was assuming 3 that if the employer is really hurt, there is a statute 4 and a rule and the statute and the rules say you have to 5 give notice and if they are hurt by that, they can 6 complain about it. 7 MR. ROSE: Right. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: But they must make mistakes 9 in their history when they file charges and didn't give 10 notice. So what does the law tell us? If you found it 11 any case ever where the EEOC didn't give the notice, now 12 the complainant files a lawsuit and it's not the 13 complainant's fault, her response is work out some kind 14 of equitable tolling. But there must be law on this, 15 because this couldn't -- this is a big agency and they 16 must have sometimes in the past forgotten to give 17 notice. 18 MR. ROSE: Oh, it's -19 JUSTICE BREYER: What does the law say 20 happens when they don't give notice? 21 MR.

There is no law to your knowledge or 6 what is there? 7 MR. ROSE: Well, I'd say the law is, Your 8 Honor, what the regulation says. The regulation was 9 adopted in 1983 after notice published in the 1981 10 regulation says that any document that has, identifies 11 the employer, essentially respondent, and identifies the 12 nature, general nature of the charge and is signed is a 13 document. By the way? 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does that appear? 15 Where does that appear? 16 MR. ROSE: It's in all the, it's in the 17 joint appendix, Your Honor.

1 name the prospective respondent and shall generally -2 shall generally allege the discriminatory acts. That's 3 what it must contain. 4 MR.

ROSE: It's the same thing. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: But if an employee files 8 something like that and says I don't consent to 9 notification of the employer, can that be a charge? 10 MR. ROSE: I think that it -- it really 11 depends whether the employee has put on top of it -- I 12 think you need -- I think there is a -- we take the 13 position that if it meets the definition of 1626.3, or 14 the other parts of 1626, it is a charge. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then, all intake 16 questionnaires are a charge, because they all contain 17 that. I mean that definition is simply inconsistent 18 with the -- with the agency's assertion that it has 19 something called an intake questionnaire which does not 20 constitute a charge unless -- I don't know -- unless 21 there's manifest whatever it is. 22 That's inconsistent because all of those 23 intake questionnaires contain all of that information -24 MR. ROSE: Well, I think -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- set forth in 26.3.

ROSE: Right. 11 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- how can it be regarded 12 as a charge against the employer which sets in effect a 13 litigation process? 14 MR.

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES 2 AS AMICUS CURIAE 3 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 4 MR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 5 please the Court: 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Heytens, let me tell 7 you going in that my -- my main concern in this case, 8 however the decision comes out, is to do something that 9 will require the EEOC to get its act in order, because 10 this is nonsense: These regulations that are 11 contradicted by forms; this failure to give notice, but 12 it's okay because it's a charge anyway. 13 This whole situation can be traceable back 14 to the agency, and I -- whoever ends up bearing the 15 burden of it, it's the agency's fault, and this scheme 16 has to be revised. 17 MR. HEYTENS: The agency absolutely agrees 18 with that, Your Honor, and the agency has taken a number 19 of concrete steps, some of which we illustrate in our 20 brief, to deal with what in reality is a very serious 21 problem. 22 I think it is important to point out, 23 therefore, right at the start, that the problems that 24 arose in this case are in some measure -- not 25 exclusively but in some measure -- a reflection of when
47

1 it arose. 2 Ms. Kennedy submitted her form in December 3 of 2001. That was before the Edelman litigation; and, 4 most importantly, it was before the February 21st, 2002, 5 memo that was issued in response to the Edelman 6 litigation. 7 Now, some members of the Court may recall 8 that one of the problems that surfaced at the time of 9 Edelman was that the agency, or at least some of the 10 field offices of the agency, had a practice of not 11 serving notice until after they received a verified Form 12 5. And the February 21st memo was to say that needs to 13 stop right now because our statutory obligations require 14 us to serve notice within 10 days of the charge. 15 So that happened immediately following the 16 Edelman litigation, which was, regrettably, after this 17 case arose. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. 19 MR. HEYTENS: Sure. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's within 10 days of 21 the charge, but that assumes, it seems to me, what's to 22 be proven. I mean what is the charge? 23 MR. HEYTENS: That's correct. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if the prefiling, the 25 intake thing, is not a charge, there is no problem.

1 MR. HEYTENS: That's correct, as well, 2 Justice Scalia, and it's important that -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you not make that not a 4 charge by saying in bold letters on the top: This is 5 not a charge. If you want a charge, ask for Form 5? 6 MR. HEYTENS: Two responses to that, Justice 7 Scalia: 8 First of all I think it's important to 9 understand that, from our perspective, the test is an 10 objective intent test that looks to the intent of the 11 employee, not the intent of the EEOC in promulgating a 12 form. 13 And the reason that's important -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do the courts have to 15 struggle with this when the agency could put in bold 16 letters at the top: This is a charge or this is not a 17 charge? 18 Why do Federal district judges have to 19 inquire into manifest intent from now until doomsday? 20 MR. HEYTENS: The fundamental source of the 21 problem, Justice Scalia, is, as this Court has 22 recognized, the vast majority of people who initiate 23 EEOC proceedings are lay people who aren't familiar with 24 the statute. 25 And the other dilemma is that a great many

1 of the initial contacts with the EEOC -- the EEOC, as we 2 set forth in our brief, got 176,000 initial contacts in 3 fiscal year 2006. Of those, 32,000 of them came in by 4 mail -- mail from lay people who have no -5 JUSTICE BREYER: And the practical problem: 6 I want to know where do I read what the definition of a 7 "charge" is in the EEOC rules. The three criteria that 8 it has certain information in it can't be the rule. It 9 can't be the rule because we already know that it isn't 10 a charge if the person says I don't want it to become 11 public. 12 So, where do I read the rule that you just 13 said? That it -- an intake questionnaire that satisfies 14 these three conditions becomes a charge if it reflects 15 the manifest intent of the person who files it that it 16 be a charge. 17 You said that. That's a pretty modestly 18 clear rule, except it isn't totally. And they qualify 19 -- where do I read that? 20 MR. HEYTENS: Certainly, Justice Breyer. 21 The definition of "charge" is the one the Chief Justice 22 cited. It is in 1626.3 of the regulations, and that's 23 -24 JUSTICE BREYER: We use the word there 25 "manifest intent"?
50
Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. HEYTENS: The word "manifest intent" is 2 not set forth expressly there. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah. Well, I read those 4 regs, and those regs had a definition that can't 5 possibly be right as applied to "intake questionnaire," 6 because they make it a charge when the person says I 7 don't want notice. So we know that isn't the thing. 8 I also know what you just said does sound 9 like a rule. I just want to know where to read it, 10 because I don't think you'd refer to a rule of an 11 agency, though normally we do -- but you don't refer to 12 a rule that doesn't exist; you don't refer to a rule 13 that nowhere can be found; you don't refer to a rule 14 that is internally inconsistent. So, before I defer, I 15 would just like to know where the clear rule that you 16 stated can be found. 17 MR. HEYTENS: Just as a point of 18 clarification, Justice Breyer, the three requirements 19 that I believe you just referred to are in 1626.6, which 20 is the provision of the regulations labeled "Form of 21 Charges." 22 We are saying that it's in construction of 23 1626.3, the definition of "charge." Now, I concede that 24 the -25 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I just want to read it

1 somewhere. 2 MR. HEYTENS: Sure. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: So that if I were not here 4 having you in front of me, as many people don't have you 5 in front of them, where I would go to read just what you 6 said. 7 MR. HEYTENS: Four places, Justice Breyer: 8 First of all, you could go to the final rule 9 as it was promulgated in 1983. There was an issue that 10 came up when the agency promulgated the final rule that 11 the definition of "charge" versus the definition of 12 "complaint," both of which are defined terms in 1626.3, 13 was ambiguous and unclear. 14 And in the final rule at Volume 48 of the 15 Federal Register, page 138, the EEOC stated that one of 16 the distinctions between a charge and a complaint is 17 that a complaint is a way for the EEOC to receive 18 information about allegations of discrimination where 19 "the party providing the information does not wish to 20 file a charge." 21 That was in the final -22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is a complaint different 23 from an intake questionnaire? 24 MR. HEYTENS: In our view, yes, Justice 25 Ginsburg. The complaint would include, in a typical
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 case, an intake questionnaire, but a complaint is 2 broader. A complaint refers under the regulations to 3 any way that the EEOC receives information about 4 discrimination. 5 The reason that's contained in the Age Act 6 regulations is because, unlike Title VII, the EEOC 7 doesn't need a formal charge in order to initiate its 8 own proceedings. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why should we defer 10 to an agency regulation when people in the agency hardly 11 ever follow it? 12 MR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, I think 13 it's not fair to say that people in the agency very 14 rarely follow it. We would agree that in certain -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you didn't -16 in this case you didn't treat it as a charge, because 17 you didn't give notice. 18 MR. HEYTENS: It's true that in this case 19 the document was not docketed as a charge, and that's 20 true; we know that. The problem is, because it arose 21 before Edelman and because it arose before the February 22 21st, 2002, memo, we simply don't know why it wasn't 23 treated as a charge. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: But you said there were 25 going to be four places. I want to write them down.

1 MR. HEYTENS: Yes. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: One is 48 Fed. Reg. 148? 3 MR. HEYTENS: 48 Federal Register 138, 4 Justice Breyer. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: 138. Now, the other three. 6 MR. HEYTENS: Yes, Justice Breyer. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that in CFR? 8 MR. HEYTENS: It is not codified in the CFR. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay. 10 MR. HEYTENS: The second place it is in 11 section 2.2 (b) of the compliance manual. That language 12 has been contained since at least 1988, if not sooner, 13 and it's quoted on page 16 of our brief. The third 14 place you would look is the February 21st, 2002 memo 15 which is on the EEOC's Web site. And it's also in the 16 appendix to our brief, which directs use of the 17 compliance manual; and it's also the August 13th, 2007 18 memo, which is also attached to our brief, and what is 19 also contained on the agency's Web site. So this is not 20 something -21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we give Chevron 22 deference to things like your internal compliance manual 23 and these other memos? 24 MR. HEYTENS: We certainly do not assert, 25 Mr. Chief Justice, that the compliance manual gets
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Chevron deference. In our view, the compliance manual 2 represents the agency's considered judgment about the 3 proper interpretation of its regulations, and is thus 4 entitled to deference under Auer. The Petitioners don't 5 allege that our regulations don't get Chevron deference. 6 The EEOC has clearly been given the authority to issue 7 regulations dealing with this topic. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under the -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Heytens, is it true 10 that the Form 5 for somebody who's not represented by 11 counsel is usually done by EEOC itself? Is it that 12 true? 13 MR. HEYTENS: In situations where the Form 5 14 is filled out in the office, Justice Ginsburg, yes, 15 that's correct. Sometimes people mail in modified Form 16 5, but official issues where it's done during the office 17 visit, my understanding is that the typical practice 18 it's filled out by the EEOC office. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Heytens, what's your 20 solution for the situation where the EEOC treats it as a 21 charge, but doesn't give notice, which is what has 22 happened here? How do you think that should play out? 23 MR. HEYTENS: In situations where the 24 employer does not receive notice, Justice Scalia? 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.
55

1 MR. HEYTENS: The first thing we think -- at 2 that point, Justice Scalia, I think that task is to try 3 to recreate as well as possible the situation that 4 should have existed, and the Commission agrees notice 5 should have been given. So the first thing, as we say 6 in our brief, the employer should be entitled to a stay 7 of the litigation for up to 60 days to attempt to intent 8 to work out, absent discovery requests, absent motions 9 practices -- the problem -- Justice Scalia, you raised 10 the problem that at that point, the person probably has 11 a lawyer and you can't talk to him, but there's really 12 -- but I think that's conceptually a separate question, 13 for two reasons. First, they might have had a lawyer 14 when they filed the charge, in which case the same 15 problem you discussed would arise; but the flip side is 16 it they could also be pro se after they filed a lawsuit, 17 in which case the ex parte bar wouldn't count either. 18 So I think it's conceptually, although I can see it's 19 probably related in practice, it's at least conceptually 20 different. 21 The second thing we think, and it's been 22 explored during the oral arguments so far, if the 23 employer could allege or show some concrete prejudice as 24 a result of not having received notice, then the 25 district court should take that into account. But in
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 this case Federal Express has simply not alleged any 2 concrete prejudice. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's on the notice 4 point. Going back to the other, more important point, 5 your words that I found quite useful are the "manifest 6 intent," that shows a manifest -- are those words going 7 to be in these four sources that I look up? 8 MR. HEYTENS: The precise words manifest? 9 JUSTICE BREYER: No. I suspect not. 10 MR. HEYTENS: Well, then -11 JUSTICE BREYER: Therefore -- I'm -12 MR. HEYTENS: Well, but I would say, Justice 13 Breyer, the word intend is in fact in the 1983 final 14 rule; it says where the person "does not intend to file" 15 --I apologize, Justice Breyer. As I stand here, the 16 word is "wish," "does not wish to file a charge." 17 The language in the compliance manual which 18 is repeated in the memorandum is well, is it states that 19 you look at whether the submission constitutes a clear 20 request for the agency to act, which we think, though 21 not exactly the words manifest -22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Just to get one thing 23 perfectly clear in my mind, does that mean if the intake 24 questionnaire is checked not consent, that would not be 25 a charge?

1 MR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, may I ask 2 -- in our view that if she had checked the box saying do 3 not disclose for identity, this would not have been a 4 charge. Thank you. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 6 Mr. Heytens. 7 Miss Lensing, you have a minute left. 8 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CONNIE L. LENSING, 9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 10 MS. LENSING: First of all, in this case the 11 affidavit attached to the intake questionnaire began -12 and this is at Joint Appendix 266 -- with the statement, 13 "I have been assured of confidentiality by the EEOC." 14 So it is a confidentiality concern. 15 Congress determined that there must be an 16 opportunity for conciliation before a lawsuit was filed. 17 We never saw the numbers that are not in the record, 18 that were testified to today, but if 247 charges were 19 filed against FedEx, in that period of time we had 25 20 age discrimination cases. So conciliation before a case 21 does work. And I appreciate those numbers because it -22 it just shows that we conciliate, we look into it, but 23 you can't do it once the lawsuit is filed. 24 The best rule obviously are the clear forms 25 that many of you have mentioned today. One can say it's
58

1 not a charge. The other one can say it is a charge, and 2 this could all be a situation where you'd have only rare 3 occurrences where notice was not given. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: How do we fix it? You 5 haven't gotten notice, you haven't had a chance to 6 conciliate -- how do we fix it? 7 MS. LENSING: Well, this particular case, 8 she could -- may I answer? 9 She could have filed her lawsuit, she had a 10 charge. She chose not to file a subsequent lawsuit 60 11 days later. This lawsuit was properly dismissed. The 12 opportunity to file another lawsuit was there. She 13 didn't need equitable tolling because she caught it and 14 she filed a charge, indisputable, and we did get notice 15 of the charge in July. I think it was filed the very 16 end of May; we got it in July. 17 Thank you. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 19 Miss Lensing. 20 The case is submitted. 21 (Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the 22 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 23 24 25
