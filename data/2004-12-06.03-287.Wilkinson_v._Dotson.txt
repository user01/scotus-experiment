5 Solicitor Cole.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8 MR. COLE: Justice Stevens, and may it please

9 the Court:

10 Prisoners typically want two things: first, to

11 improve their conditions while in prison; and second, to

12 get out of prison as quickly as possible. Respondents'

13 claims here are not conditions claims. They do not seek a

14 larger cell or better food while in prison. Rather, their

15 claims are about getting out of prison.

16 Traditional understandings of habeas would

17 suggest that these release-driven claims lie there, not in

18 section 1983, and this Court's decision in Heck confirms

19 that this common sense answer is also the correct answer.

20 In fact, Heck establishes two bars, each of which

21 independently prevent respondents from using section 1983

22 to pursue their claims here.

23 First, Heck establishes that civil actions under

24 section 1983 cannot be used to collaterally attack State

25 criminal judgments. Before a prisoner can advance a claim

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 under section 1983 that would necessarily imply the

2 invalidity of such a judgment, he must first show that it

3 has been favorably terminated. And Edwards v. Balisok

4 confirms that quasi-judicial administrative decisions

5 regarding the duration of confinement count as criminal

6 judgments for this purpose.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it isn't just duration of

8 -- of confinement. I mean, in -- in Balisok, what you had

9 was a determination that the confinement would be

10 definitely less as a result of the -- the good time

11 scheme. The -- the gut notion behind Balisok was that

12 what you were attacking would imply that the sentence

13 itself was invalid because the conviction was and so on.

14 We don't have that here. What we have here is a

15 scheme that makes a -- a sentence that is imposed a more

16 definite sentence. We know where in the range it's going

17 to be reconsidered. And however that may be classified,

18 it's not simply a Balisok situation.

19 MR. COLE: It's arguably different than the

20 good-time credits at issue in Balisok, as -- as Your Honor

21 notes. However, I -- I would suggest that even with

22 respect to good-time credits, often under many State

23 systems, good-time credits have the dual effect of moving

24 up the parole eligibility date, as well as potentially --

25 and in some States, it doesn't even have an effect on

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the --

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right, but that had --

3 MR. COLE: -- of the sentence.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that had nothing to do with

5 the rationale in Balisok, as I recall it. Isn't that

6 correct?

7 MR. COLE: Your Honor, the -- the Court --

8 that's -- that's correct, yes. And I guess what I'd --

9 I'd say is that what seemed to be driving the Court,

10 though, was still the durational aspect of the sentence;

11 that is, as the Court said in Muhammad, if a claim

12 threatens no consequence for the duration of confinement,

13 then that isn't a -- or that isn't a claim that should be

14 brought in 1983.

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: No -- no question. But the

16 durational consequence in those cases was a definite

17 consequence of longer duration, i.e., a sentence in the

18 first place, a sentence not reduced by good time in -- in

19 the second example. Here, there -- there is no such clear

20 consequence. Here, the consequence is that there will

21 simply be a period of time before a sentence already

22 imposed will be reviewed to determine whether, in fact, it

23 will be shortened or allowed to run. And that's

24 different.

25 MR. COLE: I'm not sure it is, Your Honor. Both

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of them are going to have definite durational consequences

2 for confinement.

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: No -- no question about that.

4 At -- at the level of whether there is a durational

5 consequence, they -- they both have it. I -- I grant you

6 that.

7 MR. COLE: And, Your Honor, as far back as

8 Preiser, this Court has noted that challenges to duration

9 go to the very heart of habeas corpus. That's --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The duration of -- of the

11 sentence. And here, there's no implication at all that

12 this sentence is in any way invalid, that the sentence

13 itself or any portion of it is invalid because the parole

14 would be a matter of administrative grace, but it doesn't

15 -- the determination of parole eligibility or parole

16 suitability does not go to the validity of the sentence in

17 any way, shape, or manner. Does it?

18 MR. COLE: Well, a decision from a Federal court

19 -- and I guess -- I think the answer to Your -- Your

20 Honor's question is yes, it does. And the reason I say

21 that is I think we need to look to the consequences of the

22 Federal court decision that would follow from the claims

23 that -- that the plaintiffs -- or I'm sorry -- the

24 prisoners here are advancing.

25 The State of Ohio has made individualized

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 decisions with respect to each of these respondents that

2 they should not again be considered for release from

3 prison until 2005. The request -- the relief that they're

4 requesting and the claims that they're bringing, if

5 successful, would result in the Federal court undermining

6 that State decision with regard to the length that they

7 should be incarcerated. It goes directly to the -- the --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't -- it doesn't

9 shorten the length that they're going to be incarcerated.

10 There -- there is no certainty that -- that if they win

11 this action, they will be incarcerated for a lesser

12 period, is there?

13 MR. COLE: Absolutely no certainty of that, Your

14 Honor. But there is certainty --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and there was in the

16 other cases, wasn't there? In Balisok.

17 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, I don't think so.

18 I mean, prisoners could be released in the State of

19 Washington before the terminus of their sentence. They

20 might not -- it isn't as though they had to serve all the

21 way till the end, less whatever good-time credits they

22 had. They could easily be --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but --

24 MR. COLE: -- released prior to that time.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, indeed, but the -- but --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 but getting the good-time credits entitled them to be --

2 be released earlier. They might have been released even

3 earlier still, but their entitlement to be released

4 earlier was a consequence, wasn't it?

5 MR. COLE: It was, Your Honor.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: And there is no entitlement to

7 be released earlier as a consequence of this.

8 MR. COLE: We --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: You just get another hearing

10 and maybe you will, maybe you won't.

11 MR. COLE: That's correct. You'll -- you'll

12 just get another hearing. But an important note on that:

13 you'll get another hearing, and you'll get another hearing

14 sooner than the State has decided that you should get a

15 hearing.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's true. So it makes

17 it possible that you'll get released earlier, but -- but

18 there's no assurance you'll -- really, the crucial

19 question for me, I think, is whether -- whether this could

20 have been brought as a habeas action. Could this have

21 been brought as a habeas action?

22 MR. COLE: Yes, Your Honor, it could have been

23 brought as a habeas action. If you look at the nature of

24 their complaints, they're -- they're clearly in custody.

25 Habeas would require custody and violation of the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Constitution of the United States.

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they're just asking for a

3 new hearing. They're not asking for an earlier release.

4 What's your closest case that -- that would allow a habeas

5 action which does not seek an earlier release but just --

6 just a hearing?

7 MR. COLE: I think probably the Garlotte case,

8 Your Honor, in which the Court allowed a habeas challenge

9 where the only result was going to be to advance the date

10 of eligibility for release from prison incarceration.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. But it -- No, go on.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it -- it doesn't advance the

13 date of eligibility. It advances the date at which the

14 parole board will take another look. The only eligibility

15 is an eligibility to take -- to have another look taken and

16 not an eligibility for release.

17 MR. COLE: That's true, Your Honor, but these --

18 under that understanding of eligibility, where eligibility

19 means the first possible release date. But these

20 prisoners are not eligible for release in the sense of

21 it's not going to happen for them unless and until the

22 next release hearing.

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if they are subject to

24 another look, they are not necessarily then eligible for

25 release. And I think that's the point that we're getting

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- let me -- let me ask a -- a sort of complementary

2 question.

3 Is there any reason that these --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this with an I or an E?

5 MR. COLE: I was hoping for an I, yes.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: With an I or an E?

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: With an E. With an E. But if

8 -- if you take my questioning as a compliment with an I,

9 that's perfectly okay too.

10 (Laughter.)

11 MR. COLE: I'll -- I'll wait and see what the

12 question is --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's see what it is.

14 The -- the question is, could these claims not

15 have been brought in advance of any application to these

16 particular prisoners of the revised -- whatever they were

17 -- the 1998 guidelines? And if the answer is yes, then

18 they could be brought at a time when, I suppose, habeas

19 would -- would not have been a possible remedy. Is -- is

20 -- am I correct on those two points?

21 MR. COLE: The State concedes that if they had

22 brought this case before a parole hearing at which the

23 guidelines were applied, that it would be a different

24 case, and that 1983 would be a remedy in that -- in that

25 situation.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Here's -- here's the difficulty

2 that I -- that I have. When I read your brief, I thought,

3 well, he must be right because this is really about

4 custody. It's really about custody. They want to get out

5 eventually.

6 But then when I -- I -- when I went back to

7 Balisok, I thought, oh, here's the problem. The problem

8 is that it's a damage remedy in Balisok. And normally you

9 want the person to go into 1983 to get damages. But he's

10 going to get mixed up. When do you send him to habeas?

11 Well, we don't want to send him to habeas unless it's

12 clear that habeas should have been brought. And so if

13 he's just challenging, for example, introduction of Fourth

14 Amendment violation evidence or something like that, don't

15 got to habeas. Don't go to habeas. You didn't have to go

16 to habeas unless you had to, unless you had -- unless it

17 was necessary to upset the conviction. You see? That's

18 why that language is there. Now, I got that far.

19 Then I said, oh, I see what you do. We should

20 have one rule for damages. Well, that makes sense. But

21 there's no reason not to have a different rule when you

22 have the injunctive action, and there maybe we could

23 follow your rule.

24 But the next thing I come across is a statement

25 that says, no, no, the rule is the same whether you bring

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 a damage action or whether you bring an injunctive or

2 declaratory relief action. And I said, well, why did we

3 write that? You know, we're the ones who caused all this

4 trouble. But the -- the -- well, because we didn't want

5 to make it too complicated and -- and not have all the

6 questions coming, well, what kind of an action is it

7 really, et cetera.

8 Okay. So once I got that far, I said, oh, well,

9 I'm going to have to change something for you to win.

10 Either I have to change the thing that says the damages

11 should be the same as the injunctive, or I have to change

12 something else somewhere along the line, the word

13 necessary. I don't want to change the word necessary.

14 Maybe I could change the other, but why bother really?

15 Because all that's important here is people know which way

16 they should go.

17 Now, that's where I am at the moment, thinking

18 give him his 1983 action. It's simpler. It follows from

19 Balisok. Why not?

20 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, there would be some

21 real consequences that would follow from that.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I thought.

23 MR. COLE: The reason that it's important that

24 these cases go to habeas rather than 1983 is because of

25 the State court exhaustion requirement that's attendant

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 with habeas. Parole claims like those advanced here are

2 often, if not always, intricately bound up with State law

3 issues, and the State law is often going to provide much

4 more meaningful relief than the Federal law claims that

5 the prisoners advance.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't the Prison Litigation

7 Reform Act require exhaustion even in a 1983 action?

8 MR. COLE: Yes, but as Your Honor is aware,

9 that's an administrative exhaustion requirement which this

10 Court referred to in Nelson, I believe, as a substantially

11 lower gate than the exhaustion requirement imposed by

12 habeas.

13 Moreover, it's telling --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- may -- may I just follow

15 up on that question? At the administrative level, cannot

16 these State law policies perfectly well be taken into

17 consideration? In other words, your argument was these

18 things are bound up with State law issues and the best

19 place to have them resolved is -- is in a State forum.

20 They can be resolved in a State administrative forum,

21 can't they?

22 MR. COLE: They could, Your Honor, but I -- I

23 think the types of legal determinations with respect to

24 legal entitlements and also the court -- we would assume a

25 State court would also consider Federal claims that might

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 be made by the prisoners when they bring their State court

2 claim. Those types of legal claims are better resolved by

3 State courts. They have the expertise to make the -- the

4 determination. And in fact, in Ohio --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, couldn't one say the

6 same thing of prison conditions that you can bring in as a

7 1983 action? The States know better about how their

8 prisons are operating and what changes would have to be

9 made. So I -- I think that you -- you may be right that

10 the State knows more about how its parole system operates,

11 but so does it know more about how its prison system

12 operates. And that doesn't -- that's not what determines

13 whether you have 1983 or habeas.

14 MR. COLE: Well, but Congress, with respect to

15 conditions claims -- and if you look at the language of

16 the administrative exhaustion requirement in the PLRA at

17 42 U.S.C. 1997(e)(a), it says no action shall be brought

18 with respect to prison conditions under 1983 without

19 administrative exhaustion. So even Congress, in thinking

20 about the PLRA and in thinking about requiring

21 administrative exhaustion, understood that 1983 is really

22 about conditions of confinement. 1983 isn't about -- it

23 never has been about -- release.

24 Habeas has traditionally been the relief that

25 people -- or the cause of action that people bring when

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 what they're interested in is relief -- or release from

2 prison. And these claims, no one can dispute, are

3 release-driven claims. They may not ultimately be

4 successful in securing release, but the prisoners here --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, no, I've got that part.

6 But the -- and -- and you're right about that part. But

7 that -- you know, that doesn't get over the -- the hump

8 here I think because of the -- what we've written.

9 The -- I mean, where I'm coming out now, what

10 you've just said, is well, you know, there's going to be

11 exhaustion in both cases. And prison conditions, if we

12 say that habeas doesn't -- that 1983 applies here I think

13 probably -- I can't guarantee it -- but those where prison

14 conditions would then cover it, and then there would be

15 exhaustion, and there -- where it doesn't seem to make

16 difference there.

17 And now I'm back to asking the other half of

18 this, which is, well, all right, suppose I say I see your

19 point, I think you're right. Now, what -- what is your

20 recommendation? What do we change? Do we change the word

21 necessary in Balisok, which I'd be pretty reluctant to do?

22 Or do we drive a wedge between the damage cases and the

23 injunctive/declaratory relief cases?

24 MR. COLE: I don't think you need to do either,

25 Your Honor. I think if we go back to Heck and look at the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 language there that talks about necessarily implying the

2 invalidity of a criminal judgment, which is something --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well.

4 MR. COLE: -- respondents concede in their

5 brief, the only question then is does a parole decision

6 count as a, quote, criminal --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. No, but then what

8 you're doing is taking the first half because what you're

9 reading is you're reading that word necessary, whatever

10 those words were in Balisok that we were just talking

11 about, as your case satisfying that condition. And if

12 your case satisfies that condition, then so does the case

13 where a person wants to bring a damage action because of

14 illegally seized evidence at his trial. Doesn't it? I

15 mean, because all -- I mean -- and then we've swept --

16 then we've done -- we've really moved Balisok from what it

17 was trying to do.

18 MR. COLE: I don't think that's necessarily

19 right, Your Honor, because the illegally seized evidence

20 at the trial -- I don't know that that would necessarily

21 imply the invalidity of the conviction that resulted from

22 that trial.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: Why is he bringing his damage

24 action? He thinks he's bringing it because what they did

25 at that trial hurt me. Now, how did it hurt me? It hurt

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 me because I went right to prison.

2 MR. COLE: Right, Your Honor, and that -- that's

3 absolutely correct, but I'm not arguing for, and I want to

4 make it very clear that I'm not arguing for any rule that

5 would turn on the subjective intent of the prisoner in

6 bringing their claim. It turns on the necessary

7 implication of success on that claim, and that's a -- a

8 distinction that the Court made both in Heck and in

9 Balisok. They looked to what's the necessary implication.

10 So we look to the claims here, not why they

11 brought them, but what are the claims. And the claims

12 here, and the particular ones that I would focus on, are

13 the ex post facto claims. If the -- if they have success

14 on their ex post facto claims -- and we don't believe

15 their claims are meritorious, but if they're successful on

16 those claims, there's no way the State's decision can

17 stand. They are entitled to a new hearing at which they

18 would again be considered for parole --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but does that mean the --

20 the judgment -- the order denying release on parole is

21 invalid? There are really two parts to it. One, you --

22 we're not going to release you. Secondly, your next

23 hearing will be at a later date than you want. Insofar as

24 you challenge the date of the hearing -- the date of the

25 next hearing, does that necessarily imply the invalidity

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of the entire order denying parole?

2 MR. COLE: We -- we concede that if there's an

3 ex post facto violation here, these prisoners are entitled

4 to a new parole hearing. And I guess the --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: But they're not entitled to

6 parole.

7 MR. COLE: Absolutely, Your Honor. Absolutely.

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: So that it doesn't totally

9 invalidate the order that is at issue.

10 MR. COLE: Well, the way that -- that I've been

11 thinking about it is if you put the State parole decision

12 up on the wall and you put the Federal decision up on the

13 wall, one of them has to come down. The Federal decision

14 trumps the State decision. It can --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it doesn't entirely come

16 down. It just -- half of it comes down.

17 MR. COLE: No. The whole thing comes down, Your

18 Honor. They're entitled both to an immediate new release

19 hearing and --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: But not for release.

21 MR. COLE: -- if they're successful on their

22 claims, they're entitled to more frequent release hearings

23 in the future. So the decision, the State's --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but isn't it true that

25 one aspect of your order that's under attack is they had

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 refused to grant them parole?

2 MR. COLE: Absolutely.

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: And that remains.

4 MR. COLE: It doesn't, Your Honor. They have to

5 decide that again. That -- that order is void ab initio.

6 It's as though it were never entered. They have to make a

7 new decision about whether or not this person should --

8 should have parole and that they cannot in any way -- the

9 State cannot rely on the prior decision that they reached

10 on that issue.

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: I thought the only relief they

12 were seeking was a more prompt next hearing.

13 MR. COLE: No, they -- Dotson's complaint, I

14 believe at page 20 of the joint appendix -- he wants to,

15 quote, proceed toward a prompt and immediate parole

16 hearing in accordance with the statutory laws and

17 administrative rules in place when the plaintiff committed

18 his crimes. They want an --

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But aren't -- aren't those

20 claims moot or academic now? Because, as I understand it,

21 he has had another parole hearing. So he's -- with the

22 hearing that he was seeking, he's already had another. So

23 he's not complaining about the absence of a hearing or --

24 or flaws in the procedure at the hearing. I thought that

25 this case now reduces to a clean question about the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 retroactive application of the new guidelines.

2 MR. COLE: Well, it isn't a clean question, Your

3 Honor, because exactly the same error that he alleges

4 infected his first hearing was present at his second

5 hearing. If -- if you look at the materials that they

6 added to their brief at lines 3, 7, and 8 where they have

7 the new parole decision, it's clear that Dotson's 2002

8 parole decision was predicated on exactly the same

9 guidelines, exactly the same 1998 guidelines that he says

10 violated his rights under the Ex Post Facto Clause.

11 So, in fact, if anything, it's made his

12 situation worse because a Federal decision on his claims

13 now would both necessarily imply the invalidity of his

14 previous hearing and the 2002 hearing, and the 2002

15 hearing was a release hearing. Unlike the halfway review

16 that occurred earlier, it was a full-fledged release

17 hearing in 2002, at which the parole board decided both

18 that he should not get parole then and that he should not

19 again be considered for parole until 2005.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there -- maybe I'm wrong

21 about this, but I thought there no challenge being made to

22 the 2002 hearing.

23 MR. COLE: But what Heck makes clear is it

24 doesn't matter what you say you're challenging. What we

25 need to look to is what's the necessary implication of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 securing success on your claims in Federal court for a

2 State decision. Here, the necessary implication, if

3 they're successful on their ex post facto claims, is going

4 to be that the 2002 decision can't stand, the 1999

5 decision --

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why can't it simply be that

7 prospectively for this class of prisoner, the old

8 guidelines will apply, prospectively without undoing

9 anything that's happened in the past?

10 MR. COLE: I think for the same reason that in

11 Balisok I don't think there could have been a prospective

12 order that said -- said something like the method you have

13 for choosing decision-makers creates fraud, bias, and

14 deceit, on a going-forward basis you must change that

15 method for selecting decision-makers. Saying that you

16 have to change it on a going-forward basis would mean,

17 necessarily imply, that there had been fraud, bias, and

18 deceit by the decision-maker that would mean that --

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think twice you started

20 something and our questions impeded you. But I think you

21 were equating the parole board's decision to a criminal

22 sentence, and so you -- you were saying just as the -- the

23 Federal authority can't come in and nullify the State

24 criminal sentence, neither can it nullify the parole board

25 determination. And -- and I thought that the comparison

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 between a -- a sentence -- a criminal conviction and

2 sentence and a parole board's discretionary determination

3 -- you seemed to be putting those on the same plane.

4 MR. COLE: Not exactly on the same plane, Your

5 Honor, but recognizing that this Court in Balisok said

6 that post-judgment administrative decisions regarding the

7 duration of confinement also count as criminal judgments

8 that are protected for purposes of -- of the Heck

9 doctrine. And in Greenholtz, this Court --

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but the -- the

11 generality at which you keep referring to it, with respect

12 to conditions of confinement, is a -- is a higher level of

13 generality than anything that Balisok decided. In

14 Balisok, the particular decision was a decision to revoke

15 an entitlement to be released at whatever the date the

16 good time would give, and -- and that is a much more

17 specific -- I mean, that literally affects an entitlement

18 to be released. It is not merely a decision with respect

19 to length of confinement.

20 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, if this turns on

21 whether or not it's an entitlement, I would agree with you

22 that it seems good-time credits might be different from an

23 entitlement sense than parole.

24 But -- but all the way back, in tracing the

25 cases from Preiser forward, the Court has talked about

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 duration of confinement, and certainly no one can argue

2 that the decision here is going to have dramatic

3 consequences for the duration of these prisoners'

4 confinement.

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: We -- we don't know what

6 consequence it will have for the duration of his

7 confinement. All we know is that it will have a

8 consequence in determining the date at which the next look

9 will be taken by the parole board to see whether he then

10 is in a condition to be released. That's all we can tell.

11 MR. COLE: That's correct, Your Honor, but

12 they're -- they're pressing ex post facto claims. And as

13 this point -- Court pointed out in Garner in 2000, they

14 can maybe bring those claims based on changes in frequency

15 of parole hearings, but they're going to have to show a

16 definite impact on the quantum of punishment that they

17 receive as a result of that change. So if they're going

18 to be successful on their ex post facto claims, they're

19 going to have to show an impact on the duration of their

20 confinement. Either they have no ex post facto claim

21 because there's no durational impact on their --

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But you're -- you're

23 assuming -- your argument now is assuming that they are

24 going to be successful on this element, that you say

25 they've got to satisfy later.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. COLE: Right, but that's the Heck --

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and whether they are or

3 not has nothing to do with -- with Balisok and Heck.

4 MR. COLE: I -- I disagree, Your Honor, because

5 in Heck and Balisok, the Court said look to what happens

6 if they're successful on their claims. So I'm -- we're --

7 the State is supposed to hypothesize that somehow they're

8 going to be successful on these claims. We don't agree

9 it's going to happen, but once we hypothesize that they're

10 going to be successful on an ex post facto claim, it means

11 they're going to have to show, have to demonstrate a

12 durational impact on their sentence.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. It also -- it also means

14 that if -- if -- assuming your argument is sound, if you

15 lose this case, you win the war.

16 (Laughter.)

17 MR. COLE: At -- at some level, I think there's

18 an -- an inherent and fundamental tension in their

19 position, and -- and the coin could flipped and conversely

20 there's that same tension in ours.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are -- are you sure that that's

22 what they have to prove, that -- a durational impact?

23 Wouldn't it be enough to show that they were deprived of

24 an opportunity to have the sentence shorter? Wouldn't --

25 wouldn't it -- assuming there was an ex post facto

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 violation, wouldn't that be enough of an injury, that they

2 lost an opportunity to have their sentence shortened?

3 MR. COLE: But, Your Honor, I believe what makes

4 out the ex post facto claim is an increase in the quantum

5 of punishment after they've committed their crimes. So

6 they need to show that as an element.

7 I -- I see -- I'd like to reserve the remainder

8 of my time for rebuttal, if I could.

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: You may do so.

10 Mr. Lewis.

11 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN Q. LEWIS

12 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT JOHNSON

13 MR. LEWIS: Justice Stevens, and may it please

14 the Court:

15 This case presents a straightforward opportunity

16 to apply the Heck rule. Respondent Johnson's section --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell us why -- why is

18 it still live when they -- when they already received a

19 second hearing? Or why is not moot?

20 MR. LEWIS: Johnson still has remaining claims

21 for prospective injunctive relief in this case and, as

22 well, declaratory relief. What may be mooted is his claim

23 for retroactive injunctive relief, in other words, a new

24 parole hearing. I think in order for him to pursue that

25 type of a claim, he'd have to go back down to the district

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 court.

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is --

3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, put in plain language

4 what it is Johnson is claiming he's entitled to. I don't

5 understand.

6 MR. LEWIS: Well, he -- really three different

7 things. He's requesting prospective injunctive relief,

8 fix the due process violations that are going on in Ohio

9 parole proceedings.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is a new -- a new parole

11 hearing. Isn't -- I mean, it -- I --

12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: How could that be fixed?

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. How -- how can it be

14 fixed except by giving him a new parole hearing?

15 MR. LEWIS: Well, he does have a class action.

16 He filed a class action and he's trying to fix the

17 proceeding prospectively. It doesn't necessarily require

18 him to have a new parole hearing. He's still in

19 confinement and will very likely have a new parole

20 hearing, a new parole hearing that he wants the

21 proceedings to be different in. He's not necessarily

22 asking for a new parole hearing. He's saying --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't he? If -- if -- what

24 he's saying is the past proceedings were invalid, I want

25 you to do it right in the future.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. LEWIS: Sure. I think that was part of his

2 claim, which might be mooted, but he's also saying in any

3 future --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. It -- it isn't mooted

5 because he still got it done wrong. The second hearing

6 was still wrong.

7 MR. LEWIS: Well, we don't --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: His claims here -- if his claims

9 here are correct.

10 MR. LEWIS: We don't know that for sure, but

11 part of his claim as well is to say in future parole

12 hearings that I'm going to be subjected to, even if you

13 don't give me a new one, in future parole hearings that

14 I'm going to be subjected to, I want these processes fixed

15 to -- to come into compliance with due process. And I

16 think that's separate and apart from --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you say we don't know

18 whether the -- the new parole hearing he got was still

19 invalid?

20 MR. LEWIS: I don't think there's enough in the

21 record to determine that.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, so we can assume that that

23 was valid. You're -- you're willing to assume that for

24 purposes of this case?

25 MR. LEWIS: I am not willing to assume that. I

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- I don't think we can say one way or the other.

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Well,

3 MR. LEWIS: We can't yet.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, fine.

5 MR. LEWIS: We may intend to.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Then we take it as valid. Then

7 we take it as valid. That's not a claim you're

8 challenging.

9 But I take it your claim is in the year 2009 he

10 will have another hearing.

11 MR. LEWIS: Actually 2005.

12 JUSTICE BREYER: 2005? Okay, 2005 he'll have

13 another hearing.

14 MR. LEWIS: Absolutely.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: And in the year 2005, I want

16 not to have the -- what are they called? The 1998

17 guidelines. I don't want my 1998 guidelines applied in

18 the 2005 hearing because you have some theory, maybe good,

19 maybe bad, but it's a theory that that would violate the

20 Constitution of the United States.

21 MR. LEWIS: That's correct.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying he's going to

23 have this. I want an injunction or declaratory relief

24 they can't do it.

25 MR. LEWIS: That's right, and as well, he says I

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 want to be heard at this next parole hearing. Now, that

2 was -- part of his due process allegations in this case

3 were that he -- he wasn't even allowed to meaningfully

4 participate in --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: And he's saying it violates the

6 Constitution in two respects: one, they won't listen to

7 me; and two, they apply the 1998 guidelines.

8 MR. LEWIS: That's essentially it.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: That's it. Okay. We're

10 talking now about this 2005 hearing and he wants new

11 procedures, and the question is, is this 1983 or is it

12 habeas?

13 MR. LEWIS: That's -- that's correct.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

15 MR. LEWIS: And -- and it is section 1983

16 because it doesn't violate the Heck rule. This --

17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And what -- what is your --

18 what is Johnson's mootness argument?

19 MR. LEWIS: Well, to the extent in his complaint

20 he was seeking a new parole hearing as a result of the

21 challenge to the '99 decision, that's probably mooted

22 because he has received this 2001 hearing and we just

23 don't know enough about it to know whether he's going to

24 challenge it or not. He'd have to amend his complaint in

25 the district court.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Could -- is it possible that

2 both Dotson and Johnson could get new hearings by -- filing

3 habeas --

4 MR. LEWIS: I don't think so.

5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- petition?

6 MR. LEWIS: I don't think so. I don't think

7 that Johnson has a Federal habeas remedy here because the

8 Federal habeas statute is a challenge to the legality of

9 custody, the legality of confinement, and that's not

10 anything that he's challenging in this case.

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What would you do if there was

12 an allegation of a serious procedural flaw in a past

13 hearing? The parole commission was -- was drunk or they

14 read the wrong file or something, and it was just a

15 challenge to the invalidity of the past hearing. Would

16 that be 1983 or habeas?

17 MR. LEWIS: I think that's a closer call, but I

18 think it --

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's why asked you. Why

20 isn't it --

21 (Laughter.)

22 MR. LEWIS: Right. And -- and I -- I think it

23 is still section 1983 if certain things are present. That

24 is, is he going to necessarily imply the invalidity of the

25 duration of his sentence by winning his case? And if

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that's meets the Heck rule and if he isn't, then I think

2 he can proceed in section 1983.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have any case in which

4 what was being -- what was sought to be challenged in a

5 habeas action was not the duration of the sentence, but

6 the procedure by which the duration of the sentence was

7 determined?

8 MR. LEWIS: I don't --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any -- why -- why

10 shouldn't that be a habeas action? Why shouldn't 1983 be

11 limited to prison conditions, which is what we've always

12 -- and referred to it as -- as that in the past?

13 MR. LEWIS: Well, I think in the hypothetical

14 that you've presented, Justice Scalia, if the prisoner

15 wins the case in that particular case, then his sentence

16 is invalidated, and I think that's the important critical

17 factor here.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, not necessarily.

19 He -- he's just saying the parole hearing I got lacked due

20 process safeguards. Had I had those safeguards, I might

21 -- I might -- have been given a shorter sentence. I can't

22 prove I would have. I'm not challenging the sentence

23 really, but I want a new hearing. I didn't get due

24 process. Give me a proper hearing because I might get out

25 earlier. Why shouldn't that come under habeas?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. LEWIS: Because it's not a challenge to the

2 legality of the confinement.

3 JUSTICE BREYER: My law clerk found two cases

4 which we've just looked at briefly. One is called

5 Wilwerding v. Swenson and the other Johnson v. Avery where

6 she says that in those two cases people were using habeas

7 to challenge prison conditions even. Now, so there are --

8 there are two cases that, if she's right -- and she's

9 usually right -- that -- that -- where habeas was used to

10 challenge prison conditions. So I've thought, well, if

11 they can use it, they certainly could use it here.

12 MR. LEWIS: Well, and I -- I think point with --

13 with both of those decisions is that the Heck rule did not

14 come into play because the prisoners must have gone

15 through and exhausted their State court remedies, and so

16 there wasn't an issue as to whether they must bring their

17 claim in habeas.

18 JUSTICE BREYER: No. It was a different issue,

19 but it said habeas could be brought.

20 MR. LEWIS: Sure. I think the Court in -- in

21 that particular case --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: So habeas could be brought

23 here?

24 MR. LEWIS: I don't think so.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. LEWIS: I don't think there's a remedy in

2 habeas for the respondent Johnson in this case because the

3 first thing that's going to be asked when he goes to the

4 Federal district court to seek habeas relief is, well, are

5 you challenging the legality of your custody?

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and they say sure -- sure

7 I am. I'm saying I had terms. You know, I was going to

8 be here under conditions A, B, C, and A, B, C in my

9 opinion mean I will be released sooner, and instead, they

10 gave me D, E, F, and D, E, F means I'm likely to be

11 released later. I can't guarantee it. That's what he'll

12 say. He says I can't guarantee it, but I wouldn't be

13 bringing this case if I didn't think at least it was a

14 shot.

15 MR. LEWIS: Right. And -- and -- but he's not

16 necessarily challenging the legality of his custody.

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but that's part

18 of the conclusion that we're going to have to reach to --

19 to resolve the case. Why isn't he? How is that that much

20 different than if a judge -- let's assume, under a proper

21 sentencing guideline scheme, the judge just uses the wrong

22 guideline. The man is going to go to jail for either 5 or

23 10 years. We don't know which. But that's -- that's a

24 classic habeas case. Here, he's going to stay in a prison

25 for 5 or 10 years. We don't know which. Why isn't this a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 classic habeas case?

2 MR. LEWIS: Because I think in -- in the first

3 hypothetical, Your Honor, that -- that you gave, the

4 challenge, if successful, would -- would completely

5 invalidate the sentence that he received. They'd have to

6 redo the -- the sentence.

7 And -- and I think that's the critical

8 distinction in this case, is that when Johnson files his

9 complaint, he has a 10- to 30-year sentence by the -- by

10 the State court. If he wins, he still has a 10- to 30-

11 year sentence.

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it wouldn't completely

13 invalidate the sentence. We know that he's still going to

14 be held and he's going to be held in custody. It's a

15 question of how long, which is exactly what this case is.

16 MR. LEWIS: But in the hypothetical you propose,

17 Justice Kennedy, the -- the prisoner was actually -- would

18 be actually challenging the sentence he received, and by

19 winning the case, he's going to undo the State court

20 sentence.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, those cases happen

22 to involve -- happen to involve sentences. This case

23 doesn't involve a sentence. It involves an opportunity to

24 have his sentence shortened. And if habeas can be brought

25 for that, we would phrase it differently. We wouldn't say

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it would have to invalidate the sentence. We would say it

2 would have to invalidate the proceeding that could have

3 shortened his sentence. I grant you we can't use the same

4 language we did in the earlier cases, but if this is

5 properly a habeas action, then we -- we can get some

6 language to make it fit.

7 MR. LEWIS: Well, I don't -- I don't think it is

8 properly a habeas action. I think even in the decisions

9 where courts may have heard similar claims in habeas, I

10 think it was a matter of just saying, well, the prisoner

11 is already here. He's already exhausted all of his State

12 court remedies. It doesn't really matter whether it's

13 section 1983 or habeas.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we wrote an opinion

15 that said, whatever the reasoning -- I don't know what it

16 would be right now -- that said in the future your client

17 should go ahead in 1983. I'm putting you in a slightly

18 awkward position, so don't answer if you don't want to.

19 But I mean, for the future all these cases will be brought

20 in habeas. Now, suppose that's what the opinion said.

21 We're absolutely making it clear just what the -- would

22 there be any harm done?

23 MR. LEWIS: I -- I think there would be.

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what would that harm be?

25 MR. LEWIS: I think that by -- by having a rule

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of that sort, that it would be expanding the jurisdiction

2 of habeas and it would start to swallow up otherwise

3 cognizable section 1983 claims.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: And why would that be bad?

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: And why --

6 MR. LEWIS: I'm sorry?

7 JUSTICE BREYER: Why would that be bad?

8 MR. LEWIS: Well, because the Congress has

9 enacted a statute --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. But I mean, is -- I'm

11 asking you a practical question as a practicing lawyer.

12 Would it be bad?

13 MR. LEWIS: Absolutely it would.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Because?

15 MR. LEWIS: Because there's a statute that

16 allows --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, leaving aside --

18 Congress changed the statute. It says absolutely it's

19 going to be habeas. Is there any bad consequence in the

20 law?

21 MR. LEWIS: It's going to give States a license

22 to violate civil rights that will otherwise not be

23 protected under the statute.

24 JUSTICE BREYER: We'll catch them in habeas.

25 MR. LEWIS: Yes, but the -- the State exhaustion

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 requirements in habeas are much tougher. Of course, the

2 State wants them to have to go through State exhaustion.

3 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, so it comes down to that.

4 MR. LEWIS: That's really the critical --

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: You said -- you said a moment

6 ago that it would be expanding habeas, and I'd like you to

7 expand on that. It would be expanding habeas, I am

8 assuming, because in every successful habeas case, the

9 ultimate remedy that the court can order, if the State

10 does not snap to it, is the immediate release of the

11 prisoner. And I take it when you said it would expand

12 habeas, it would expand it because this would not be an

13 immediate release case no matter what. Is that correct?

14 MR. LEWIS: That's correct.

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

16 MR. LEWIS: You would basically end up going to

17 a Federal district court seeking habeas relief asking for

18 processes to be changed prospectively.

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: And that's why they could not

20 bring habeas in this case because if they won, they still

21 would not have shown anything that entitled to them to get

22 out now or get out now unless the State within 30 days

23 does something. Is -- is that the nub of it?

24 MR. LEWIS: That's -- that's really it, Justice

25 Souter.

2 depends how you formulate the order. The -- the judge

3 says, I'm going to order this prisoner released unless,

4 within 6 months, he has a parole hearing under the

5 guidelines I set. That's the way the habeas statute

6 works.

7 MR. LEWIS: Well, if that's the relief that the

8 -- the prisoner was seeking, I think that is clearly a

9 habeas claim. But that's not what Johnson is claiming in

10 this case. He's not asking for entitlement to release at

11 all. He's asking for the processes to be changed

12 prospectively for future parole hearings, and he's asking

13 for declaratory relief.

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Regardless of what he's asking

15 for, if he got what he wanted, he still would not be

16 entitled to any immediate release.

17 MR. LEWIS: That's absolutely correct.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: He would still have a sentence

19 of X years, and the question is, how often are we going to

20 look at him to decide when, within X years, we may let him

21 out. Is that --

22 MR. LEWIS: That's -- that's absolutely it. He

23 cannot -- by winning his case, he's not going to shorten

24 his sentence in any way. And that's -- that's a big

25 distinction from the Balisok case where there was an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 automatic entitlement to a shorter sentence --

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he might --

3 MR. LEWIS: -- for Balisok in that case.

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- he might shorten the term

5 of his confinement.

6 MR. LEWIS: Might but not necessarily. And this

7 Court made very clear most recently in the Nelson

8 decision --

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you could say the same

10 thing when you're challenging the sentence. He might but

11 he might not. We're just -- we're just hearing the case.

12 MR. LEWIS: I think a challenge to the sentence

13 necessarily invalidates that sentence if you win. But a

14 challenge to parole is much different because you're not

15 affecting the sentence if you win your case. And the term

16 necessary is completely necessary to the Heck analysis, as

17 this Court made clear most recently in the Nelson case

18 from last term.

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's the nub of it I guess.

20 The fact that he may be granted parole has no implication

21 for the validity of the sentence.

22 MR. LEWIS: That's absolutely right.

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: In fact, it assumes the

24 sentence is valid, but that he will probably stay clean if

25 he gets out. That's all it means, isn't it?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. LEWIS: That's really all it means. And

2 this Court last term in Muhammad in -- in footnote 1 made

3 clear that the incarceration that matters for this

4 analysis is the -- in the incarceration of the sentence

5 from the State court. And I think that's -- that's what

6 the Court needs to look at, is what is Johnson's effect on

7 the State court judgment or sentence. What's the

8 necessary implications? Not in this case at all.

9 And really, this case I think has already been

10 decided by Wolff. It's something that the petitioners

11 sort of don't mention too much in their briefs. In Wolff,

12 the prisoners in -- in that case were trying to get their

13 good-time credits back. I think this is an easier case

14 than the Wolff decision. And what the Court did was parse

15 out, okay, you can't get your good-time credits back, but

16 you can seek prospective injunctive relief to fix the

17 processes that are used in connection with depriving

18 prisoners of good-time credits. And that's precisely what

19 Johnson is seeking here.

20 Your Honor, the other thing I wanted to mention

21 was the notion -- Your Honors, the other thing I want to

22 mention was the notion that there's no State review of

23 these decisions. The Prison Litigation Reform Act clearly

24 provides for State administrative review of even

25 challenges to the process. So the -- the State of Ohio

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 could easily set up an appeal process administratively to

2 -- to correct that problem.

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Lewis.

4 MR. LEWIS: Thank you.

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Untereiner, is it?

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN E. UNTEREINER

7 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT DOTSON

8 MR. UNTEREINER: Yes, Justice Stevens.

9 Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:

10 I'd like to, first of all, go to the point that

11 Justice Ginsburg raised about the allegations in Mr.

12 Dotson's complaint. This case has -- has become much

13 simpler with respect to Dotson because any claim that he

14 might have had about this 2000 scheduling decision has

15 been mooted.

16 What's really left are claims for future

17 injunctive relief, for prospective relief. These are

18 classic 1983 type cases. Prisoners have been bringing

19 lawsuits since Wolff against McDonnell alleging that

20 parole procedures and other kinds of procedures,

21 disciplinary procedures ought to be reformed and seeking

22 future injunctive relief with respect to those kinds of --

23 of procedures.

24 In Edwards against Balisok, this Court indicated

25 that ordinarily claims for prospective injunctive relief

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 will not be barred by the Heck doctrine because ordinarily

2 they will not call into question or necessarily imply the

3 invalidity of any previous decision. So to Justice

4 Breyer's question, this would require a change in the law,

5 and it would, I think, fairly substantially cut back on

6 the kinds of suits that have been brought for 30 years

7 under Wolff because in all kinds of suits like this, the

8 State would argue, as the petitioners are arguing today,

9 that there's some prior administrative decision that's

10 called into question by a future claim for injunctive

11 relief with respect to some aspect of the procedures

12 relating to good-time credit revocation or parole or the

13 revocation of probation. So I think this would be a

14 fairly substantial change in the law. A lot of these

15 claims would be barred by Heck.

16 The -- Justice Scalia, you asked a question

17 about the habeas, the scope of habeas relief. And I think

18 it's important to understand that the lower courts have

19 generally held that habeas is not available for these

20 kinds of claims that are prospective only, seeking changes

21 in future procedures. There are some lower court cases

22 that say that where a prisoner seeks release on parole and

23 demands a right or claims a right to release on parole,

24 that might be cognizable in habeas, but the vast weight of

25 authority in the lower courts is that claims that only

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 seek an -- the right to a new parole hearing, the outcome

2 of which is completely discretionary --

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want a 1983 hearing in

4 which a United States district judge tells the parole

5 commission, now, here are your marching orders for future

6 cases. You have to comply with this rule, that rule, this

7 rule. What is an analog that you can give us where United

8 States courts have done this under 1983? Using an

9 administrative case, if the -- if the agency does it the

10 wrong way, we reverse that decision. It would be like a

11 review of a conviction that's not final. Have we had

12 cases where under 1983 litigants come in and say, now,

13 these agencies are doing it the wrong way? You have to --

14 can you give me an analog?

15 MR. UNTEREINER: I think there -- there are a

16 fair number of cases in the lower court where -- lower

17 courts where these types of claims for injunctive relief

18 have been brought and the Federal courts have ordered, on

19 a prospective basis, that the States conform to all kinds

20 of -- I mean, Wolff is a case like that I think where the

21 -- the State was required to do certain things in the

22 future. So I think these are ordinary 1983 claims for

23 injunctive relief.

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any significant

25 difference between this case and Wolff? I mean, Wolff was

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 a case of procedural fault supposedly, and if those faults

2 were cured, someone would have a better chance at getting

3 good-time credit. Wasn't that what --

4 MR. UNTEREINER: Yes.

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it seems to me it's very

6 -- very close to your situation.

7 MR. UNTEREINER: It is very close, Justice

8 Ginsburg. Dotson is essentially making two claims for

9 prospective relief. He is saying that these 1998 parole

10 guidelines effectively rescind his eligibility for parole.

11 At the time of his conviction, he was entitled to parole

12 after serving 15 years. Under these guidelines, he'll

13 have to wait till -- until 32 and a half years have passed

14 before he's eligible for parole. And he's claiming that

15 in -- in his next parole release hearing, which is in June

16 2005 and beyond, the State is required to apply the old

17 rules to him so that he'll be eligible. So this is very

18 much like what was at issue in Wolff.

19 The second claim he has is that he's entitled to

20 annual parole release hearings in the future. Again, it's

21 a future -- it's a prospective claim only. In the future,

22 he will be entitled to annual parole release hearings, and

23 the new rules say that the State can postpone those

24 hearings for up until 10 years.

25 So on both of those claims, he is seeking

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 changes in the future, and these are classic 1983 type

2 cases that have been brought, as I say, for the last 30

3 years in the lower courts.

4 Now, the Heck test requires a showing that if he

5 prevails on his section 1983 claims, he would -- that

6 would necessarily imply the invalidity of his underlying

7 conviction or sentence. And I think this case is very

8 different from the Balisok case. There -- there was a

9 colloquy about that earlier. I think that Balisok is

10 clearly distinguishable because the administrative

11 decision there would have had an immediate and direct

12 impact on the duration of the prisoner's sentence by -- by

13 revoking the good-time credits. Whereas, here, the impact

14 is very, very speculative.

15 Justice Souter, you referred earlier to a

16 durational consequence. The durational consequence here

17 is really quite hypothetical and remote. If he prevails

18 on his 1983 claims, all he will be entitled to are future

19 hearings, and since parole is entirely discretionary in

20 Ohio, we can't predict the outcome of those proceedings.

21 He'll also be entitled to -- merely to be considered

22 eligible for parole in the future. So I think that the --

23 the consequences -- any impact on -- on the duration of

24 his confinement is -- is really quite hypothetical here

25 and it would require an expansion not only of the Heck

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 rule but also of habeas jurisdiction to resolve this case

2 in the State's favor.

3 Unless there are any further questions, we would

4 ask that the Court affirm the Sixth Circuit's unanimous

5 decision in favor of Dotson. All 11 members of that court

6 found that Dotson's claims were not barred by Heck, and

7 this Court should affirm.

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, counsel.

9 Mr. Cole, you have about 4 and a half minutes

10 left.

11 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE

12 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

13 MR. COLE: Thank you, Your Honor.

14 A number of points. I wanted to start by

15 responding to Justice Souter's question, which was again

16 asking about this need for entitlement to early release

17 as part of habeas, and would ask the Court to consider the

18 In re Braden case where a prisoner in Alabama was seeking

19 to challenge a detainer that had been issued by Kentucky.

20 And the basis for the challenge to the detainer in habeas

21 was the fact that it was having implications for his

22 parole eligibility in Alabama. So there, there was not

23 going to be necessarily an entitlement to earlier release,

24 but simply a difference in the parole considerations.

25 Second, Justice O'Connor, with respect to your

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 questions about mootness, the only point that I would add

2 is that if this case is moot now, it was moot when the

3 Sixth Circuit decided it as well. So if mootness is the

4 direction we're going, I think there need to be a decision

5 vacating the judgment below --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what's your position as

7 to whether or not it's moot?

8 MR. COLE: Your Honor, we don't believe it's

9 moot either, and in -- in fact, for two reasons. First,

10 once again, it's threatening consequences for an existing

11 decision, albeit it not the one that was originally

12 threatened or where invalidity would be implied below, but

13 there is a new one where that would have that consequence.

14 In terms of bad consequences, I think the single

15 biggest bad consequence of directing these prisoners to

16 1983 rather than habeas is it's going to deprive them of

17 the opportunity for meaningful relief in Ohio's courts.

18 The Layne decision in the last -- decided just 2 years

19 ago, three prisoners brought a declaratory judgment action

20 about the way parole works in Ohio. They were successful

21 and their case resulted in 3,000 prisoners receiving --

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but you raise

23 deprivation of the benefit they would get from the Ohio

24 courts. If they wanted that benefit, they could have

25 brought a 1983 action in State courts. State courts have

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 jurisdiction. So it's a little odd for you to say, oh,

2 they're being deprived of a benefit when they're telling

3 you by this very lawsuit they don't want it.

4 MR. COLE: That's true, Your Honor. At the same

5 time, this -- bringing this -- this case in 1983 in

6 Federal court means that they're not going to be able to

7 get injunctive relief on State grounds under the Pennhurst

8 doctrine. So they are depriving themselves of a chance to

9 get that type of meaningful relief that Ohio courts are

10 offering and that courts in other States are offering.

11 The other -- the other point I wanted to make is

12 that with respect to Petitioner Johnson's argument, his

13 understanding of sentence, that if it doesn't impact the

14 sentence, it can't be in habeas, would mean that parole

15 revocations can't be in habeas either. A parole -- parole

16 -- when you're on parole, you're still serving part of

17 your sentence, as he understands it, part of the initial

18 term that the court has imposed upon you. Granted, you're

19 not doing it in prison, but a parole revocation wouldn't

20 impact your sentence. It would merely bring you back into

21 prison to serve the remainder of your sentence rather than

22 having you serve it on the street. So I think that

23 understanding of sentence can't make sense for -- for

24 habeas purposes.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think sentence means custody.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Don't you think it means custody?

2 MR. COLE: Well, but to the extent we're

3 talking --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: The custody you've been

5 sentenced to?

6 MR. COLE: But to the extent we're talking about

7 duration of custody or duration of confinement, again, the

8 claims here do have a -- success on the claims here would

9 have a meaningful impact on the duration of confinement.

10 This Court in Muhammad said -- I think this is probably

11 the -- the closest quote on point -- challenges to

12 particulars affecting the duration of confinement are the

13 province of habeas corpus.

14 This is a challenge to a particular, the parole

15 procedures, that's affecting the duration of their

16 confinement. Or at least that's their allegations, and

17 that's what success on their claims is going to mean. And

18 because of those durational consequences, as well as

19 because of the consequences of success on the merits for

20 previous State parole decisions, we believe that those

21 claims are better routed to habeas than to 1983.

22 If there are no further questions.

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: I had one further question.

24 Are you asking us to change anything in Wolff against

25 McDonnell, or can we follow that case?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. COLE: I think we can follow that case as

2 it's been reinterpreted in Heck. Wolff said that -- well,

3 Heck said that Wolff was about challenges that would not

4 -- and I believe the language is -- necessarily vitiate

5 the underlying decision. So the way Heck understood Wolff

6 was that the procedural challenges there, with regard to

7 the prospective relief they were seeking, were not the

8 type of relief that would necessarily vitiate any decision

9 that had already been made.

10 Here, by contrast, the claims that they're

11 bringing, the ex post facto claims, if they're successful

12 on the merits, would necessarily vitiate the decisions

13 that have gone before.

14 Thank you, Your Honors.

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Cole.

16 The case is submitted.

17 (Whereupon, at 10:57 a.m., the case in the

18 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
