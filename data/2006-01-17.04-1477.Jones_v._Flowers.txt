2 (11:12 a.m.)

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

4 next in Jones v. Flowers.

5 Mr. Kirkpatrick.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL T. KIRKPATRICK

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may

9 it please the Court:

10 In Mullane, this Court held that due process

11 requires that notice efforts conform to what a person

12 who actually desires to provide notice would do under

13 the circumstances. Such a person would not turn a

14 blind eye to the return of an initial mailed notice,

15 but would consider reasonable follow-up steps to

16 provide that notice.

17 Where valuable real property is at stake and

18 the State learns that its initial effort has failed,

19 the State should do two things. First, it should

20 search readily available sources for a better mailing

21 address and resend the notice, and second, if a better

22 address cannot be readily ascertained or the second

23 notice also fails, the State should post a notice on

24 the property or contact the occupants.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kirkpatrick, I don't

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 recall what -- what the rule is. Does notice have to

2 be given by registered mail? Would it -- would it be

3 adequate notice in the -- in the ordinary case to send

4 notice by regular mail?

5 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Scalia, in a case

6 like this where there's valuable real property, regular

7 mail would not be sufficient to comply with due

8 process, and the reason why is this. A reasonable

9 person who actually desires to give notice will use

10 certified mail for the information that comes back to

11 the sender. Then the sender either knows the notice

12 has been received and they can stop with confidence, or

13 they know that they have failed and there's still time

14 to take reasonable follow-up steps.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but do we have a case

16 that says that, you have to use registered mail?

17 MR. KIRKPATRICK: No, Your Honor.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think we did. And

19 it would seem to me that especially when you have the

20 taxpayer's name and address on file, I doubt whether it

21 would be a denial of due process to send notice by

22 regular mail to that address. And if -- if that

23 satisfies due process, the State would never have known

24 that it did not reach the individual.

25 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Scalia --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it seems -- it seems

2 mean to punish the State for going the extra mile and

3 sending the notice by registered mail because that

4 informed them that it didn't reach him.

5 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Yes, but Justice Scalia,

6 the State, once informed that the letter had never

7 reached Mr. Jones, did nothing. The State was

8 indifferent to the information that came back. So, in

9 fact, what the State did here was no better than

10 sending regular mail because they ignored the

11 information that came back from the use of certified

12 mail. And, in fact, had they used regular mail, it

13 might have been better for Mr. Jones.

14 Now, we're here in this case to discuss what

15 due process --

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why?

17 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Well --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In Mullane, it was regular

19 mail. It wasn't certified mail. Right?

20 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Yes, that's correct.

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And isn't it 100 percent

22 clear that there were a number of those addressees who

23 didn't get the letter?

24 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Yes, Justice Ginsburg,

25 that's correct, but --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And yet, their interests

2 were cut out by the decision, and the Court said that

3 was okay.

4 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Well, the context was very

5 different in Mullane because in Mullane there was a

6 large number of interested parties with very small

7 interests in a trust, and what they were being given

8 notice of was an accounting to settle those trusts.

9 And as long as some of the people who were similarly

10 situated received notice, they could act in a way that

11 would protect other members of the class.

12 Here, we're talking about real property with

13 just a single owner, and in this case, where we have an

14 $80,000 house that was lost and sold for only $21,000,

15 it would seem to me that due process would require more

16 than just regular mail.

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have another

18 factor here that wasn't present in Mullane; that is,

19 the person who received notice has a statutory

20 obligation to advise government of the current address.

21 The people involved in Mullane had no such obligation

22 to notify anybody of their current address.

23 MR. KIRKPATRICK: That's correct, Justice

24 Ginsburg. But what Mullane announced is that the

25 government must use reasonable diligence to ascertain

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 an address where it can be found. In this case, we

2 don't quarrel --

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It wasn't the government

4 in -- in Mullane it wasn't the government.

5 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Well, that's right. The --

6 the party charged with giving notice in Mullane had an

7 obligation --

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: How do -- how do we -- I

9 mean, this was the problem I -- I had with -- with your

10 -- your brief here, and it's the same problem Justice

11 Ginsburg has. What kind of weight, what significance

12 do we give to this obligation to keep the government

13 informed?

14 On the face of it, it seems like a -- an

15 obligation that ought to get considerable weight.

16 Everybody knows that if you own real estate, you've got

17 to pay real estate taxes on it. You're going to have a

18 hard time doing that if they don't know where to send

19 the bill, and so on. So it seems like a very

20 reasonable obligation for the government to put on you.

21 What weight do we give that in -- in the

22 analysis?

23 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Souter, I think it

24 is given weight when we evaluate the reasonableness of

25 the initial notice effort, and we do not quarrel with

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the State first sending notice by certified mail to the

2 last address in the State property records.

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: And then that would be so

4 even if there were no affirmative obligation on the

5 property owner.

6 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Yes.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: You'd say, well, if they --

8 if they send the -- the notice to the last address they

9 had, or if they send it -- since we're talking about

10 real estate, maybe if they send it to the -- to the

11 property, nothing wrong with that. So that's kind of a

12 wash.

13 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Souter, I think

14 that there are a couple of points that need to be made.

15 One is that Mr. Jones' failure to update his

16 address did not relieve the State of its constitutional

17 obligation.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: No. But I want to know what

19 Mr. -- I mean, it does not relieve it of some

20 constitutional obligation, and we're trying to figure

21 out what that is. And -- and the point of my question

22 is in figuring out what it is, what significance do we

23 give to the affirmative obligation on the part of the

24 property owner to keep the government informed of the

25 address?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KIRKPATRICK: The answer is once the

2 State was informed that the first mailed notice had

3 failed, it gets no significance.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then -- then it

5 has no significance ever because the -- the State has

6 an obligation to use the best address it has, whether

7 he's got an obligation to -- to keep the address

8 updated or not. And -- and this is the -- the tough

9 point for me with your case. It seems to me that your

10 case depends on our saying the obligation to keep the

11 -- the address current has absolutely no significance.

12 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Souter, it has no

13 significance once the State is actually informed that

14 the notice has failed because I think the significance

15 of the statute is it increases the State's confidence

16 in the address that it's initially using. But once the

17 certified mail comes back unclaimed, at that point it

18 knows that the address from 1967 in its records and the

19 statutory obligation to update the address, that is

20 outweighed by actual knowledge that in both 2000 and

21 2003 the certified mail notices were not received.

22 I'd like to go back to Justice Ginsburg's

23 first question about why regular mail might actually

24 have been better in this case. Had regular mail been

25 sent, we don't know what would have happened. We might

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 not have had a due process challenge because the

2 envelope would have ended up in the mailbox at Bryan

3 Street. It would have been brought inside by the

4 occupants, and they may very well have brought it to

5 Mr. Jones' attention, the way they did when they

6 received the eviction notice after the redemption

7 period had closed.

8 But I think the most important factor, even

9 if we don't agree on whether certified mail was

10 required by the Constitution in the first instance, is

11 that once the government used certified mail, it cannot

12 then ignore the information that it gained as a result

13 of that choice. This --

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And he also had a

15 continuing obligation to inform the government of his

16 address.

17 One fact about this case that -- perhaps it

18 was in the record and I missed it. At the time the

19 property was sold, how much did Mr. Jones owe, taking

20 account of the back taxes, the interest, the penalties,

21 all that?

22 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Approximately $6,000

23 because the property was sold for $21,000. The minimum

24 bid was the assessed value of the property, which in

25 Arkansas is 20 percent of the fair market value. So

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that was about $14,000. Plus about $4,000 in back

2 taxes, another 10 percent in interest, and another 10

3 percent in penalties, and some small, in this instance,

4 costs of notice.

5 But that brings us to an important point, is

6 that the cost of notice and the cost of a search to

7 find a better address will not be borne by the State.

8 It will be borne either by the owner as a cost of

9 redeeming the property or it will be borne by the

10 purchaser as a cost of acquiring the property. So

11 certainly here where we have an $80,000 house sold for

12 $21,000, there was sufficient margin to allow for some

13 costs to find Mr. Jones so that he could be informed

14 without making this property --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: How did they find him, by

16 the way?

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you tell me --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: -- how in your opinion?

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, excuse me.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: How did they find him?

21 MR. KIRKPATRICK: The purchaser served an

22 eviction notice to the property --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: No. I'm not saying how did

24 they? How in your opinion should the Post Office

25 Department or the government have found him?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KIRKPATRICK: They should have searched

2 three categories of sources for a better address and

3 then tried mail again. And those three categories are

4 the State's own records, such as the driver's license

5 records or voter registration rolls; second, public

6 directories like the phone book or an Internet search

7 engine; and third, they should have considered using

8 commercial services such as those that are used by

9 creditors.

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: So they find 13 people

12 called Gary Jones or G. Jones in Little Rock. Now,

13 what do they do?

14 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Two things. One is they

15 can look for the Gary Jones that has some tie to the

16 Bryan Street address, and certainly --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt with this

18 question? Do you think all those steps were

19 constitutionally mandated?

20 MR. KIRKPATRICK: No. I think what is

21 constitutionally --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: What was constitutionally

23 mandated in your view?

24 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Reasonably diligent efforts

25 to ascertain a correct address after the return of the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 first certified mail and how far --

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: So you would not include

3 posting on the -- posting a notice on the house as

4 constitutionally mandated.

5 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Stevens, I would.

6 First, I think that the State can search for a better

7 address by mail.

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, they can -- they can do --

9 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Yes.

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- a lot things.

11 MR. KIRKPATRICK: But --

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm trying to decide what

13 they must do.

14 MR. KIRKPATRICK: With real property, if the

15 owner has not been notified by mail, absolutely I think

16 they should post notice on the property. That is a

17 traditional way --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would that be

19 constitutionally sufficient if they posted a notice?

20 MR. KIRKPATRICK: It would be

21 constitutionally sufficient if they posted a notice

22 because they could not ascertain a better address.

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, now so it would not

24 be constitutionally sufficient if that's all they did.

25 MR. KIRKPATRICK: That's correct. And I

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 think that's --

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: So what is the

3 constitutional minimum that would be sufficient?

4 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Reasonably diligent efforts

5 to find a better address and if a better address --

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: It would be decided on a

7 case-by-case basis depending on the particular facts in

8 the case.

9 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Well, this Court in

10 Schroeder v. City of New York, I think, recognized that

11 it's impossible to have a mechanical rule to apply in

12 every circumstance. I do think, though, that the --

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: And your opponent argues

14 very persuasively the mechanical rules are very

15 important in this particular area of government

16 business.

17 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Well, they are, but in this

18 case, the State knew within 2 weeks of sending the

19 initial mailed notice that it had not been received.

20 That was 3 years before the taking. So there was

21 sufficient time for the State to take some very minimal

22 efforts to provide notice.

23 And remember, with regard to posting, in this

24 case the State actually visited the Bryan Street

25 property and they did not post a notice or contact the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 occupants at that time, although they could have done

2 so for virtually no cost at all, no additional effort.

3 And we know from what happened with the eviction

4 notice that had they taken that very minimal effort to

5 post the notice, it would have worked.

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I take it in -- in this

7 case -- I mean, I -- you're probably right that it

8 would have -- it would have worked here, but I -- I

9 take it that in the absence of that -- that hindsight,

10 you would say that in -- in the regular case that

11 simply posting notice on the house, after the letter is

12 returned, would not be enough, that the -- that the

13 posting on the house would be sufficient only if they

14 had exhausted other efforts to get a better address so

15 that in this case, going back to Justice Breyer's

16 example, they -- they'd have to follow up whatever it

17 is, the 18 G. Joneses or Gary Joneses that they could

18 find in the phone book before they could then fall back

19 and resort to posting on the house. Is -- do I

20 understand you correctly?

21 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Souter, you do.

22 That -- that is our -- our point, but I would like to

23 qualify that slightly.

24 In -- if the search does not, with reasonably

25 diligent efforts, turn up a better address or if

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there's a better address and the letter comes back, I

2 think at that point it's perfectly reasonable to stop

3 searching for an address, to give up on mailed notice,

4 and at that point post the property because getting --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the search of

6 -- the search of what? Just Little Rock or the State

7 of Arkansas? What if this guy had moved to Chicago?

8 They -- he'd be out of luck under your approach then.

9 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Well, if they contracted

10 with a credit bureau, for example, or a skip tracer, it

11 is quite easy to find people that have moved across the

12 country, much easier today than it was, you know, years

13 ago because technology has really expanded the amount

14 of information that is readily ascertainable.

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many people --

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does -- does it follow from

17 your argument that someone who purchases at a tax sale,

18 before they conclude the purchase, should find out what

19 the State has done?

20 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Kennedy, that would

21 be a reasonable way to have a statutory scheme.

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the purchaser from that

23 purchaser the same. In other words, if Flowers had

24 sold to X, then X has to make the same inquiry because

25 he sees I guess what, a quit claim deed or a tax sale.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 So before a purchaser can purchase from Flowers, that

2 purchaser too must see whether or not they hired an

3 outside agency and so forth.

4 MR. KIRKPATRICK: It might be prudent to do

5 that. I think that one --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, isn't it required to

7 do that under your title, if you're going to have your

8 title set aside by Jones?

9 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Yes, although if the title

10 is set aside, Ms. Flowers will receive a full refund of

11 all the money that she's paid, and that's under the

12 Arkansas statutory scheme.

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about the

14 purchaser from Jones? If -- pardon me -- from Flowers.

15 If Flowers has spent the money, then that purchaser is

16 out of luck.

17 MR. KIRKPATRICK: That may be correct and I

18 think when somebody goes to purchase property and they

19 find out that title insurance is not available because

20 of the tax sale deed, they have to consider the

21 potential exposure.

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So one of the consequences

23 of your rule is to devalue any property sold by the

24 government because it is open to this kind of challenge

25 for deficiency in title. So you've now devalued the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 property in the hands of the State.

2 MR. KIRKPATRICK: I think only for a

3 temporary period of time because there's a 2-year

4 statute of limitations to challenge the sale and that's

5 why the State tells tax sale purchasers that they

6 should not make expensive improvements to property

7 until that time has closed.

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, Mr. Kirkpatrick?

9 In Arkansas, is the tax -- tax delinquency a matter of

10 public record so a prospective purchaser would find it

11 by making a title search?

12 MR. KIRKPATRICK: It is a matter of public

13 record. I'm not sure whether --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it could be revealed by

15 a title search?

16 MR. KIRKPATRICK: I don't know, Your Honor,

17 whether a title search would reveal it, but certainly

18 in the county records, all of the delinquent properties

19 are entered and open to the public for inspection.

20 They may have to look in two different places.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would this case come out

22 differently? You know, your client had an

23 obligation to keep the State informed of -- of his --

24 his address so that they could send the tax bills to

25 him, suppose the statute, in addition to simply

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 reciting that obligation, said, and if the taxpayer

2 does not keep the State advised of his current address,

3 any notice mailed to the last address that he gave will

4 suffice for all purposes.

5 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Scalia, I --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose it said that

7 explicitly. Would that -- would that make this case

8 come out differently?

9 MR. KIRKPATRICK: No, it would not because --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? I mean, the State can

11 punish people for not doing what the law tells them to

12 do, and here the State is saying we tell you to keep us

13 -- you keep us advised of your -- your address. If you

14 don't, I guess we could throw you in jail for half a

15 year, but no, we're not going to do that. We're just

16 going to say that -- that your -- your punishment for

17 violating the law is that this kind of a notice will

18 suffice.

19 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Scalia, I believe

20 the Federal constitutional obligation would still apply

21 regardless of whether the State of Arkansas tried to

22 legislate its way out of it.

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but there -- no, but

24 this is a consequence of violating the law of -- of

25 Arkansas. Certainly the State can impose consequences

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 for violating its law.

2 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Well, it --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, and my next

4 question is going to be, if you say it would come out

5 differently, then isn't -- isn't it sort of silly to

6 make the State go on and say that? If they could do

7 the same thing by simply reciting what's going to

8 happen, why -- why should we make them do that?

9 MR. KIRKPATRICK: I don't think that --

10 Justice Scalia, I don't think that -- if Arkansas

11 had that kind of statute, that it would make this case

12 come out differently because I think the due process

13 analysis and the application of the Mullane standard to

14 these facts where the initial mailed notice comes back

15 would be the same. I think it may be a factor, when

16 we're determining what is reasonable, whether or not

17 the owner complied with that statute, but I don't think

18 that Mr. Jones loses his constitutional right.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could they fine him for not

20 -- could they fine him for not -- for not keeping them

21 advised of -- of where -- where his tax address is?

22 MR. KIRKPATRICK: I suppose as a matter of

23 criminal law they could.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: They could. Suppose they

25 could. Right.

1 Could they fine him -- how much money did you

2 lose here?

3 MR. KIRKPATRICK: He lost about $70,000 worth

4 of equity.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could they fine him $70,000?

6 MR. KIRKPATRICK: That would seem to be a

7 very harsh penalty.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's pretty harsh, but do

9 you think this Court would strike it down?

10 MR. KIRKPATRICK: I do.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: You do.

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: I frankly don't see the

13 difference between failing to keep the State advised as

14 to your residence and failing to pay your taxes. He

15 knew he had a duty to pay the taxes.

16 MR. KIRKPATRICK: That's right.

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: And should not that figure

18 into the analysis?

19 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Stevens, it should

20 not figure in at all because he still had a statutory

21 right to redeem the property, and once he had that

22 statutory right to redeem the property, due process --

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, no, I understand

24 that. But doesn't -- he would know whether the taxes

25 had been paid or not.

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

1 MR. KIRKPATRICK: In fact, in this case he

2 did not. And while the record is rather sparse on

3 this, the mortgage company paid the taxes for 30 years.

4 After the mortgage was retired, Mr. Jones thought that

5 the occupant, Mrs. Jones, was paying the taxes. He was

6 mistaken in that belief and that's what happened here.

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, this is a very unique

8 fact situation. We're trying to announce a rule that

9 will govern the typical transaction. And is it not

10 true that typically the homeowner will know whether or

11 not he's paid his taxes?

12 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Typically the homeowner

13 certainly should, but we all make mistakes and

14 certainly there are lawyers --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: But he has to make mistakes

16 for 2 or 3 years running before it's significant.

17 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Arkansas set up a statutory

18 scheme that gave him a right to redeem up until 30 days

19 after the sale of the property. That statutory right

20 -- he gets due process whether he's innocent or not

21 innocent. And I think in the case where --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but how long do the

23 taxes have to be in arrears before they can send him a

24 notice and start the proceeding running?

25 MR. KIRKPATRICK: They wait until the taxes

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 have been delinquent for 1 year. At that time, it's

2 certified from the county to the State. They send

3 notice saying that 2 years into the future, there will

4 be a tax sale if the property hasn't been redeemed.

5 Even after that public sale, there's a 30-day

6 redemption period.

7 In this case the house didn't sell at the

8 public sale. So then we started an entirely new

9 process of the negotiated sale, which again involved

10 notice and ultimately the property was sold at

11 negotiated sale. So there is sufficient time after the

12 State learns about the failure of the initial mailed

13 notice to take further reasonable steps.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kirkpatrick, you

15 distinguish Mullane. You recognize that a lot of the

16 people never got that notice, and you said there were

17 many people involved there, that you could rely on

18 others. It's also how much of a burden are you going

19 to put on the notice-giver when you have a large class

20 involved.

21 There was a figure -- and I forgot what the

22 number it was -- of how many notices are -- don't succeed

23 in delivery.

24 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The

25 -- the figure, which comes from the Tsann Kuen case out

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of Arkansas Supreme Court, is that there are 18,000 tax

2 delinquent parcels certified every year in Arkansas.

3 But what we do know is that 85 percent of tax

4 delinquent properties in Arkansas are redeemed by the

5 owner either before the tax sale or within 30 days

6 after. So we don't know how many notices came back

7 unclaimed after the first attempt.

8 JUSTICE BREYER: His wife is living in the

9 house?

10 MR. KIRKPATRICK: She was.

11 JUSTICE BREYER: Were they divorced?

12 MR. KIRKPATRICK: No. They were separated.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So he owns the

14 house. She doesn't. She must not pay any taxes, and

15 she sees these letters coming from him registered and

16 says, oh, they're his problem. That's basically what

17 could have happened.

18 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Basically, Justice Breyer,

19 but the -- the letters --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: If you have that kind of

21 relationship with your wife, doesn't he have an

22 obligation to watch what's going on?

23 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Yes, he does have some

24 obligation to watch what's going on.

25 But I would like to point out that the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 letters did not actually come to the house. There were

2 three delivery attempts for each letter, but the

3 letters themselves -- nobody was at home during the day

4 when the letter carrier came by. So the letters

5 themselves were not left.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Did they leave a notice?

7 MR. KIRKPATRICK: If the letter carrier

8 followed proper procedures, a notice would have been

9 left, but there's nothing in the record to indicate one

10 way or the other whether that happened.

11 But at most, that notice would say that there

12 was a certified letter for Gary Jones and it may have

13 said that it was sent by the Commissioner of State

14 Lands. It didn't say tax delinquent notice. The

15 county is who assesses the taxes. Many lay people

16 might think that the Land Commissioner of Arkansas was

17 writing about the parks or the State forests or any

18 number of things. So I don't think we can charge Mrs.

19 Jones with knowledge that there was a tax delinquent

20 notice waiting for Mr. Jones just because, if the

21 letter carrier did what he or she should have, a notice

22 of delivery slip would have been left at the house.

23 But remember also that after the first notice

24 came back, it was 3 years later when they sent the

25 notice of the negotiated sale, and that was after they

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 knew that it was likely a futile gesture to send

2 certified mail to Mr. Jones at that address, and it was

3 after they had actually gone out and visited the house.

4 So at a minimum, they should have posted a

5 notice at the property. And while in some cases like

6 Greene v. Lindsey or Schroeder v. City of New York,

7 posting was inadequate, and the Court said that mail

8 would have been better, at least here, knowing that

9 mail had not worked, even if the State chose not to

10 search for a better address, at a minimum they should

11 have posted a notice at the property and that would

12 have made all the difference in this case.

13 If there are no further questions, I'd like

14 to reserve my time.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

16 Mr. Phillips, we'll hear from you.

17 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

18 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

20 and may it please the Court:

21 It's somewhat startling to me that in a case

22 involving the fundamental question of what notice is due

23 under the Due Process Clause, that the phrase,

24 reasonably calculated to provide notice to the affected

25 property owner, was never used in the petitioner's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 submission because at least, as I remember Mullane I

2 suppose from my law school days and -- and since then,

3 that is the fundamental test. The question is has the

4 State undertaken to -- to make a reasonable calculation

5 to, in fact, provide notice under these circumstances.

6 It's sort of startling to me in the -- in the

7 face of a decision like this Court wrote in Mennonite

8 Board, where it says explicitly, you know, the minor

9 inconvenience and administrative burden of using the

10 regular mails is a complete answer to claims that

11 something less than that should be provided.

12 And again, petitioner's counsel's first answer

13 to the question, would ordinary mail have been

14 sufficient under these circumstances, is no. For

15 property like this, that's not sufficient. It seems to

16 me that -- that the Dusenbery case answers that because

17 while it was true that the mails that were sent

18 originally to the prison itself were certified, there's

19 no certification process to get the mails --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe this day -- in today's

21 world, a registered letter is worse than ordinary mail.

22 That is, I don't think -- my understanding is that the

23 post office, unlike FedEx and unlike UPS, if you're not

24 home, they leave a -- a notice, you know, and you check

25 a box, and if you check the box, they'll leave it off

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the next day. We don't live in a -- my wife isn't

2 home. My wife works. And -- and most wives no longer

3 stay home to get the mail, and we don't all have

4 butlers at the door.

5 And you call up the post office. They say,

6 oh -- if you get through to a human being, which takes

7 15 minutes, after you go through the menu, they say,

8 phone the post office branch. And they say go get in

9 the car, find a parking place, get in the line, and

10 there's half a morning gone.

11 Now, why is that a reasonable way? Why can't

12 they do what FedEx does? This is a world -- husband

13 works, wife works, two children are screaming. We've

14 got to get them to the doctor. We have to have them at

15 school. They have appointments all morning, and

16 there's nobody home.

17 So whatever they did with Mullane and said

18 registered mail is fine, why isn't it unreasonable to

19 use that system rather than use FedEx's system?

20 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, that's a pretty

21 remarkable due process constitutional --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why not? It says

23 calculated. It may be. Now, you tell me why it's so

24 remarkable because I think I could take judicial notice

25 of what life is like for most families in the world

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 today, that they don't have butlers, et cetera.

2 MR. PHILLIPS: I may -- I may let Mr. Feldman

3 defend the -- the Postal Service because he is the

4 Solicitor General's lawyer.

5 (Laughter.)

6 MR. PHILLIPS: But the reality is that for

7 the vast majority of the mails, the mails do get

8 through. And -- and it is a reasonable calculation

9 that if you mail something to someone --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But --

11 MR. PHILLIPS: -- that it will get there and

12 it will be properly delivered. That's the -- the

13 purpose of the certification.

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the whole point

15 -- at least I understand -- of Justice Breyer's

16 question is that you have taken a step to make it more

17 difficult for the mail to get through by insisting that

18 the person be there to sign for it, and it's obviously

19 more likely than not he's not going to be there. And

20 if you had just used regular mail and dropped it off, I

21 think more likely he would have gotten it.

22 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- the purpose of

23 using certified mail is to make sure that it actually

24 got to the person --

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. The purpose of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 certified mail is to make sure you know if it didn't

2 get to the person. And you knew that and then you

3 didn't do anything about it.

4 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, now it works both ways,

5 though, Mr. Chief Justice, because if -- if it goes to

6 my neighbor -- let's assume numbers are transposed --

7 it goes to my neighbor and the neighbor is there and

8 sees the information, they'll say that the -- that

9 that's -- that goes to across the street. And then you

10 take it across the street and you get it signed.

11 That's because you talked to a specific individual. So

12 it is, in fact, designed to enhance the likelihood that

13 it will actually get there.

14 But I don't think the issue here is --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: Wait. Let -- let them do

16 that. Fine. Just have a little box and the person

17 signs and says, tomorrow leave it at the house, just

18 like FedEx does.

19 (Laughter.)

20 MR. PHILLIPS: And as a matter of policy, I

21 wouldn't necessarily disagree with that.

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is the FedEx rule of

23 due process.

24 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is the FedEx rule of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 due process.

2 (Laughter.)

3 MR. PHILLIPS: That's exactly what it is.

4 And as I say, as a matter of policy, Justice Breyer, I

5 wouldn't necessarily disagree with it. But as a matter

6 of what the Constitution strait-jackets States to

7 provide, it strikes me as a -- as a pretty

8 extraordinary rule.

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: But is the Chief Justice

10 not correct that ordinary mail is more apt to get to

11 the destination than certified mail?

12 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, if it is, it's probably

13 only at a -- at a marginal number. My guess is --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: But even if it's marginal --

15 MR. PHILLIPS: -- the percentages are very

16 small.

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- the -- the principal

18 purpose of the certified mail is to let the sender know

19 whether or not the notice was received. It would seem

20 that a State that decides to -- to make it necessary in

21 every case to find that answer should have some -- some

22 purpose in doing so and -- and, therefore, some follow-

23 up that would occur when it's not delivered.

24 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, except for this problem

25 -- I mean, the other problem you have is that we don't

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- all we know is that it wasn't -- it -- it came back

2 unclaimed. So we don't even know that it didn't get

3 delivered. All we know is that no one was prepared to

4 sign for it and accept it.

5 We don't know, as Justice Breyer's

6 hypothetical --

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but you also know

8 that nobody got the notice. If nobody signed for it

9 and took it, nobody read the letter.

10 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, you could look at the --

11 you could look at the outside and say, I'm not going to

12 sign for this, and it's unclaimed.

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you would know that

14 the letter was not opened and read by the addressee.

15 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, to be sure, I know that

16 it wasn't opened and read, but all I'm saying is that

17 what we don't -- we don't even know --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: And if it isn't opened and

19 read --

20 MR. PHILLIPS: -- that Justice Breyer is

21 correct.

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- if it isn't opened and

23 read, they didn't get notice. They didn't get actual

24 notice.

25 MR. PHILLIPS: They didn't receive actual

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 notice. And, of course, this Court has routinely said

2 that there's no constitutional requirement that they

3 receive actual notice.

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask one other

5 question I intended to ask your opponent? How many

6 States have rules that require something more?

7 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I think in their reply

8 brief at least, they make an effort, and we didn't go

9 and -- and do a 50-State survey between a week ago and

10 now to find out. But, you know, a fair number of

11 States do. I -- I would say 15, 20.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Including -- including

13 Arkansas. Didn't Arkansas change its law so now it

14 requires if you -- if it's unclaimed, they have to do

15 personal service?

16 MR. PHILLIPS: If it's their homestead, not

17 -- not for every property that is -- for which taxes

18 are not paid, but for --

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This taxpayer, though --

20 MR. PHILLIPS: -- for property -- I'm sorry?

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This taxpayer -- even

22 though he failed to give notice of his current address,

23 this taxpayer would be entitled under the current

24 statute to personal service.

25 MR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice Ginsburg, I don't

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 believe that is true because this is not this

2 taxpayer's homestead. He no longer lives at this

3 address. He, as his -- as his argument, spends a great

4 deal of time explaining --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought he still lived

6 in --

7 MR. PHILLIPS: -- he lives elsewhere.

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought he still lived

9 in Arkansas.

10 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, he lives in Arkansas,

11 but that doesn't make this his homestead.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Homestead.

13 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I see.

15 MR. PHILLIPS: So he wouldn't -- he wouldn't

16 qualify for the --

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.

18 MR. PHILLIPS: -- for the additional law.

19 But again -- and it seems to me that just

20 demonstrates the wisdom of Justice Brandeis' reference

21 to the small laboratories because what we -- what we

22 have here are a raft of different approaches that the

23 States take to give either more or less notice so long

24 as you satisfy the constitutional minimum. The problem --

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, counsel, one

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 thing you did -- your client did was provide notice by

2 publication in a local newspaper.

3 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you bother

5 doing that?

6 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, in part because we --

7 we're putting out a notice to the public that we're

8 selling the property. So it serves two purposes. It

9 notifies that there's a sale to take place. It also

10 identifies the landowner, giving -- or the property

11 owner one more opportunity --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't -- you

13 don't rely on that as in any way discharging your

14 constitutional obligation to provide notice to the --

15 to the homeowner.

16 MR. PHILLIPS: On its own, it clearly

17 wouldn't suffice. The Court has decided that a long

18 time -- I mean, that is Mullane.

19 But I think as an -- as an additional

20 component, if you -- if you really want to get into the

21 totality of the circumstances rather than what I think

22 is the better rule, which is to say, as you evaluate

23 what we did, was it reasonably calculated to provide

24 notice, and conclude, yes, it was reasonably calculated

25 to provide notice under this Court's rulings that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 mailing is an appropriate way to proceed, I think we

2 would win there.

3 If you go beyond that and say, well, no, you

4 have to do something-plus, if you go down the

5 reasonably diligent efforts kind of an approach, I

6 would say then don't go any further than say that

7 you're required to publish the fact of the sale itself

8 because to go beyond that is -- is to open this. And

9 -- and we've already seen this --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: See what you think of this.

11 If in fact the letter --

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: What would you think of a

13 rule that said --

14 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: What would you think of a

16 rule that said if you use certified mail and it returns

17 uncollected, the additional step you must take, you

18 just send ordinary mail?

19 MR. PHILLIPS: I think if the Court were to

20 say the -- the additional step you must take is to send

21 ordinary mail, we could probably live with that kind of

22 a rule. The problem is, one, that's not the standard

23 that's been proposed here. Their standard is going to

24 be and if it turns out that you find out after that

25 that that didn't get delivered, then you have to go

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 through this litany. You have to -- you have to engage

2 in posting. You have to contact the occupant and

3 contact the relatives, contact their employers, retain

4 a skip tracing service, use the telephone directory,

5 run a credit check, although we don't have Social

6 Security numbers, do an Internet search. And each time

7 when it comes back that there's some indication that

8 you didn't -- that they didn't receive notice, which

9 they'll always say is because -- otherwise for -- for a

10 property that is valuable, if I had received notice, I

11 would have shown up. You have an ongoing, continuing

12 obligation to find --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but skip that. What

14 about -- you know, I was thinking precisely the same,

15 but just with slight -- if you get the letter back

16 and you don't have the FedEx rule, you either have to

17 have the FedEx rule or send a letter.

18 MR. PHILLIPS: It sounds like you're

19 legislating, Justice Breyer.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: No, because the purpose is

21 to get reasonably calculated to get notice, and in the

22 world today, there are an awful lot of houses where

23 nobody is home, you know, and there's no convenient way

24 for them to go to the post office without giving up a

25 certain amount of work. And so they say, forget it.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 If it comes from the lands division or something, who

2 cares? Now, that -- I don't know how you'd know how

3 many there are like that, but it's a question of

4 reasonable calculation now to get the mail through.

5 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it seems to me, Justice

6 Breyer, you're adopting a rule that's designed to

7 protect a very, very tiny minority and to impose a

8 burden, a significant burden, on every State.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: Is it a tiny minority --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not even sure it

11 protects that minority. I think there are a lot of

12 people who won't be home when the -- when the postman

13 comes with the -- with the registered letter, but there

14 are very few who -- who won't take the trouble to -- to

15 pick it up. I mean, it may be --

16 MR. PHILLIPS: And -- and the flip side of

17 that is there's nothing that indicates why even -- even

18 the person -- if somebody is unwilling to go -- to take

19 the time to find out what the Commissioner of Lands in

20 the State has sent a certified letter for, why is it --

21 why would you assume that whenever the letter comes in

22 when it's addressed to Mr. Jones, that Mrs. Jones isn't

23 going to toss it aside just as quickly?

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can --

25 MR. PHILLIPS: There's no -- there's nothing

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that indicates one way or the other what -- what is a

2 preferable system to operate. And that's why I think

3 this is intensely a legislative judgement.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: But isn't there a second

5 purpose for -- for sending it certified mail? And that

6 is, it assures that it doesn't get lost. I think they

7 track it closer. They can tell you where the letter

8 is. I think each post office has to record that

9 they've received it and so forth.

10 MR. PHILLIPS: They do. That -- that's --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Whereas if you just sent it

12 regular mail, it may have been lost.

13 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. That -- that's always --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: This -- this assures that it

15 reaches the destination.

16 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. That --

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose -- suppose we had

18 a case where the homeowner has kept the Lands

19 Commissioner informed of her current address, does

20 everything she was supposed to do except at the time

21 this notice, certified mail notice -- at the time of

22 the delivery attempt, she's hospitalized having a

23 quadruple bypass, so she never gets it. And then what

24 -- what are the consequences of that?

25 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, I don't want --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 I don't want to fight the hypothetical, but you have to

2 put a little in context in a case like this because the

3 process here is one that's fairly protracted. You get

4 the first notice and then there's not -- there's no

5 actual sale for 2 years. And in this case, the sale

6 didn't take place, so there was -- you know, the

7 auction didn't lead to anything, and then there was

8 another -- another sale. So we're talking about

9 essentially a 3-year period of time when the person has

10 to be incapacitated, during which presumably -- and

11 there have been multiple, six different efforts to try

12 to send notice to her. So it's, you know, one, not a

13 particularly likely hypothetical. I realize I

14 shouldn't fight it.

15 But two, I think at the end of the day, the

16 answer is you can't put the burden on the State to

17 understand the -- the precise situation of each of the

18 individual homeowners, that they have some duties

19 because they know, one, they do owe taxes; two, in

20 Arkansas they should know that they owe us a duty to

21 keep us up-to-date with respect to their situation, and

22 where -- and where it is that we can reach them. And

23 so it's reasonable to impose those duties --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your --

25 MR. PHILLIPS: -- because in the vast

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 majority of cases -- I'm sorry -- due process will be

2 satisfied because notice will, in fact, be received.

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your -- your

4 position is, though, when you get the certified

5 letter returned is you have no obligation to do

6 anything further.

7 MR. PHILLIPS: That's correct, because --

8 because the difficulty is once you go past that, what

9 -- what obligation you have becomes completely

10 unknowable at that stage.

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it seems to me that

12 even you might not have an obligation, it seemed to me

13 you would have a motivation to do more because you want

14 to collect your taxes.

15 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, and that's -- that --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which is sort of puzzling

17 to me as why the States don't have a -- an affirmative

18 interest in providing the best notice that they can.

19 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Stevens, the truth is

20 most of them -- we do. And -- and this is not a -- and

21 -- and look at the way the system operates here. It's

22 not like we -- we sent out this notice, got back, and

23 raced off to sell the property with a gotcha in hand.

24 I mean, we -- we went through a very protracted process

25 each time trying to get this person to -- to show up.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 I mean, put this into a certain amount of

2 context. And again, you have to deal with the

3 generality of cases rather than this one, but I mean,

4 this is a property that's got a tax lien on it already

5 for unpaid income taxes of -- of approximately, I

6 think, about $14,000, and then it has unpaid property

7 taxes, you know, up to the -- up to the total amount of

8 $200. And you know, under those circumstances, we let

9 it sit there for years. I mean, there's no question we

10 would be better served if -- if they would have shown

11 up and just paid off the taxes.

12 But it seems to me that all goes into the

13 calculation of what's the right answer as a legislative

14 matter, and legislatures have made pretty reasonable

15 adjustments in terms of, you know, how strong is -- I

16 mean, I think what Arkansas did here. If this is your

17 homestead, we're going to go just as far as you said,

18 Justice Stevens, to try to make sure we get the

19 information to you.

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it of any --

21 MR. PHILLIPS: If it's not, then we're not --

22 I'm sorry.

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it of any relevance to

24 consider the burden or the obligations this rule

25 that petitioners advocate place on downstream

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 purchasers?

2 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, I think absolutely because

3 it's significantly undermines the State's overall

4 effort in trying to get its money back because it's all

5 well and good to say we can sell the property, but if

6 nobody is going to pay for the property anything that

7 comes close to the value of even getting our liens paid

8 off, then we're not going to get the revenue stream

9 that we would otherwise be entitled to. And even if

10 you, you know, go through the -- through the kind of

11 machinations of --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, you would get the

13 whole -- you'd just get a little bit less because the

14 cost of notice is borne by the purchaser and if they

15 have to do a Google search or use one of these other

16 services, it's going to add a little bit more to their

17 cost, and you're just going to get a little bit less.

18 It's not going to interfere with the administration of

19 the program.

20 MR. PHILLIPS: That assumes that there's a --

21 that there's a purchaser that wants to undertake the

22 burden and -- and to assume that risk.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: For getting the

24 property --

25 MR. PHILLIPS: I mean, we couldn't sell this

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the first time out.

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- for getting the

3 property in this case, we're at 20 percent of its

4 market value. It's -- it's worth another $500 to you.

5 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it's

6 worth taking at least 2 seconds to focus on the market

7 value argument here, this $80,000 number. That was a

8 number that arises in connection with the supersedeas

9 bond, and it's only a number that came forward by the

10 private loan -- property purchaser, not the State. And

11 the reason was, was because they said, if you don't put

12 up an $80,000 bond, we want to take over the property

13 immediately. And so they had every incentive to say a

14 number that was significantly higher than what the

15 value of this property is.

16 The best evidence of what the value of this

17 property is is around the $20,000 that a real purchaser

18 put on the table in order to purchase it. The point

19 here --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no. That's

21 -- Mr. Phillips, property bought at -- at delinquent

22 tax sales is usually bought at far less than its market

23 value.

24 MR. PHILLIPS: I'd be willing to stipulate to

25 that, Mr. Chief Justice, but the truth is nobody showed

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 up even for an auction on this property. So we don't

2 have much in the way of evidence as to the value of it.

3 And all I'm saying is the suggestion of -- of

4 $80,000 as the relevant number here is a number that's

5 picked out of the air for a purpose that has nothing to

6 do with fair market value. It has to do with the value

7 of a -- of a bond that would have to be issued in order

8 to stop the transfer of possession of the property in

9 the ejectment action.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Your -- your friend said

11 that the $80,000 comes from the fact that it -- at the

12 -- at the auction, it -- the opening bid is one-quarter

13 of the fair market value. He said something like that.

14 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it has to be -- I think

15 it has to be a minimum that, but you know, it could be

16 100 percent of the fair market value.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- well, was the

18 opening bid $20,000? So it was at least one-quarter of

19 the --

20 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but it could also be

21 100 percent.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: I see.

23 MR. PHILLIPS: So you don't know. And -- and

24 in his brief, his argument was that we -- that there

25 was a stipulation to the $80,000.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the $20,000 would have

2 been a permissible bid even if the market value was

3 $40,000.

4 MR. PHILLIPS: Exactly. That -- that's the

5 only point I was trying to make on that score.

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Would your argument be any

7 different if there weren't a statutory obligation to

8 keep the government informed of the -- of one's mailing

9 address?

10 MR. PHILLIPS: I think I would still make the

11 same argument. I just think the argument has

12 extraordinary force when the -- when the petitioner has

13 an obligation to provide us with notice because, again,

14 it goes -- you know, why is this reasonably calculated?

15 It's -- it's in the context of a scheme that says you

16 will provide us specific information and we will rely

17 upon that as the mechanism by which we inform you of

18 your obligations to us and that under those

19 circumstances and only those circumstances, do you

20 forfeit your property rights.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it seems to me

22 unrealistic to assume that the average citizen would

23 know that duty more clearly than he'd know the duty to

24 pay his taxes.

25 MR. PHILLIPS: The -- the only reason he

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 would know that duty is because every -- every property

2 tax form has on it a change of address at the very

3 bottom of it that's perforated. So every time you get

4 a tax form, you get a thing that says change your --

5 let me know if you've changed your address.

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is there a provision of

7 Arkansas law that if in fact they do track down the

8 property owner and he is at an address different from

9 the last address that he had given, that the expense of

10 tracking him down may be charged to him, along with the

11 delinquent taxes, penalties, and so on?

12 MR. PHILLIPS: The -- the statute talks about

13 costs, but the State has never interpreted that term to

14 mean just sort of the out-of-pocket -- those kinds of

15 inchoate costs, and they usually talk about very

16 specific costs like the cost of noticing publication

17 and other -- you know, other items that you can -- you

18 know, where you have a receipt.

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: So in practice the answer is

20 no?

21 MR. PHILLIPS: In practice the answer is no.

22 If there are no other questions, Your Honors,

23 I urge the Court to affirm.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

25 Phillips.

2 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

3 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

4 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

5 MR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

6 please the Court:

7 The notice that was provided in this case

8 satisfies the Mullane reasonably calculated test.

9 First, the State sent it by certified mail.

10 Certified mail -- actually in response to a question

11 that came up earlier, the form -- when certified mail

12 is -- is delivered and the recipient is not there, they

13 leave a form 3849. That form isn't in the record, but

14 I think it's probably available from any post office.

15 On the reverse side, it says, we will redeliver or your

16 agent can pick up your mail at the post office, and it

17 has a place for the person to check off a box saying to

18 redeliver and leaves instructions to leave this where

19 the postman can find it.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but redeliver -- you

21 have to be there to sign for it again.

22 MR. FELDMAN: Right, but they --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, then --

24 then the problem --

25 MR. FELDMAN: They do need a signature.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I'm thinking -- what I'm

2 thinking is that where -- where you're trying to reach

3 a person, the means has to be reasonably calculated.

4 I'm simply saying a means today is not reasonably

5 calculated to reach the average person unless it gives

6 him the choice of getting it when he's not home. All

7 right?

8 Now, there are two ways that could happen.

9 One, you could modify that form or, second, the simple

10 rule would be if it comes back undelivered, mail them a

11 letter.

12 MR. FELDMAN: The Court -- I believe that

13 certified mail is -- is a more reliable method than

14 first class mail because it requires the mailperson,

15 the carrier, to get to -- get a signature at -- at --

16 he has to go from a particular person. He can't

17 deliver it to the wrong place. Also, the post office

18 itself has means whereby the carrier has to keep track

19 of how many receipts he's supposed to have, whether

20 he's brought them back and so on.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't say all that.

22 MR. FELDMAN: And --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: I said do either. What I --

24 what I was thinking of, which isn't clearly I think

25 coming across, is send it certified mail, by all means.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Fine. He either has to sign and say, leave it off

2 tomorrow, I'm not home, or if the post office doesn't

3 make that available, then if the letter comes back

4 undelivered, the person who's trying to send him notice

5 has to send him an ordinary letter.

6 MR. FELDMAN: And if the Court were to adopt

7 that rule, it would give States an enormous incentive

8 and people giving notice to just send things by first

9 class mail in the first instance, which this Court has

10 repeatedly said and has -- has said is -- is sufficient

11 to satisfy due process, including in cases involving

12 tax sales in the Mennonite case, condemnation of

13 property in the -- in the City of New York case, and

14 similar kinds of events.

15 Certified -- what the State did here, though,

16 it has always -- it has generally been thought that

17 certified mail is a more reliable means of giving

18 people notice, and that's what the State used here.

19 And I don't -- I don't take petitioner to be arguing

20 that they made a mistake because they used certified

21 mail rather than First class mail.

22 Having said that, the State also sent the

23 mail to the only address, probably the only address

24 anywhere in the public record. What it needed was

25 something that tied this person to this address, not to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 somebody named Gary Jones somewhere in the State or the

2 world. And probably the only thing in the --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, none of

4 this would have been sufficient if we were talking

5 about your -- your client, the IRS. They do far more

6 extensive effort to find the individual before they

7 sell property for delinquent taxes.

8 MR. FELDMAN: I say they -- they do slightly

9 more. What the IRS does do is there is a requirement

10 and Congress can provide and other States can provide

11 that more resources should be spent in something like

12 this than the minimum due process floor. But what

13 they've provided is that where the property owner is in

14 the IRS district, then -- then personal service is what

15 they first attempt. Where the -- where the property

16 owner is not in the Internal Revenue district, then

17 they do exactly what the State did, which is they send

18 it via certified mail. And they check up -- I think

19 they check a postal database of change of address

20 forms.

21 But we know in this case that there was no

22 change of address form because when the letter came

23 back, it didn't come back saying, moved, here's the new

24 address or -- or change of address form expired.

25 In any event, this was probably the only

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 thing in the public record that tied this taxpayer to

2 this property, and that's what the State used. And

3 then it further used publication and sent another

4 notice. There was a total of six different times when

5 the mail carrier attempted to -- to deliver it and, if

6 he followed the postal regulations -- there's no reason

7 to think he didn't -- left a notice on the door.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, which way is

9 that -- I mean, the fact that he tried six times and he

10 wasn't there should have told the State this isn't

11 working.

12 MR. FELDMAN: Well, right, but the State

13 under the Dusenbery case is not obligated to provide

14 actual notice. The State is obligated to provide

15 notice reasonably calculated to let the person know

16 what's going on, and if the person is not responding to

17 a notice from the Commissioner of State Lands and going

18 to the post office to pick it up or asking for it to be

19 redelivered, I don't think this Court has ever

20 suggested that in those circumstances, the notice is --

21 is inappropriate because the -- the landowner hasn't

22 taken the steps that he should have taken to -- to, in

23 fact, I think a -- a large part of what petitioner's

24 argument here is, is really at bottom an attack on

25 Dusenbery. Dusenbery said -- the Court held actual

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 notice is not required. What's required is just notice

2 reasonably calculated to reach someone.

3 But under petitioner's rule here, the State,

4 as soon as it finds out some doubt -- and that's all it

5 had here -- some doubt about whether it had the right

6 address because it may well have had the correct

7 address and he didn't go to the post office to pick it

8 up. As soon as it had some doubt about whether it had

9 the right address, it has to take unspecified further

10 steps to send it out again to another address, and if

11 that doesn't work, presumably another address and

12 another address. And each -- whatever method, whether

13 it's a directory or the Internet or whatever method it

14 uses, it's -- it's going to create a litigable issue

15 about whether did it do the right thing, did it use the

16 right Internet service, did it use the right telephone

17 directory, did it go in a wide enough area, should it

18 have done the whole country.

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but your

20 position is they don't have to do anything.

21 MR. FELDMAN: Yes, our position is that the

22 standard is if it was reasonably calculated to provide

23 notice at the time it was sent, which in this case it

24 was -- they used the only address in the public record

25 that ties him to this property, and their belief that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 they had the right address was supported by the State

2 law that said he has to provide them with a change of

3 address. That under those circumstances, they've done

4 enough, and if it comes back and just says, well, he

5 didn't pick it up at the post office, then that's --

6 then they've satisfied the rudimentary --

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Mullane said

8 that we look to what a person who really wanted to find

9 the person would do. A person who really wanted to

10 find Mr. Jones and got the certified letter back

11 saying, nobody is claiming this, would have done

12 something more.

13 MR. FELDMAN: I -- I don't think that that's

14 necessarily true. And -- and Mullane also said that

15 what the -- whoever it was who had to provide the

16 notice in that case had to do was provide notice to the

17 addresses. The addresses were at hand was the phrase

18 that it used.

19 And in other cases, the Court has talked

20 about the line between publication notice, on the one

21 hand, and notice by mail. That line is a line of

22 addresses that are very easily ascertainable. If

23 they're very easily ascertainable, you have to send the

24 mail. If not, then that's what publication notice is

25 for.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 And it seems to me in this case, when the

2 notice came back unclaimed, then the State was entitled

3 to assume that either it had provided notice and he

4 just didn't want to pick it up or, at worst, that his

5 address was no longer very easily ascertainable, and at

6 that point his obligation was only to publish notice,

7 which it did.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which -- which you

9 agree does no good at all. Right?

10 MR. FELDMAN: I don't agree it does no good

11 at all. I --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When is the last time

13 you read legal notices in a newspaper?

14 MR. FELDMAN: I don't ordinarily do it.

15 (Laughter.)

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Have you ever done

17 it?

18 MR. FELDMAN: I -- I can't recall.

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No.

20 (Laughter.)

21 MR. FELDMAN: But I --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: I think a lot of people who

23 buy property at tax sales do read those notices

24 regularly.

25 MR. FELDMAN: What I was going to say is I

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 think that every year, I'm confident that there's home

2 -- there's people throughout the country probably who

3 are notified of -- of tax sales and things like that

4 because someone sees it, someone lets them know.

5 They're keeping an eye on that to see what's happening

6 to their property. He had left his property without

7 leaving a change of address form with the State, and it

8 -- it is possible.

9 Now, notice by publication is not preferred,

10 but what -- the line that's drawn in Mullane and the

11 Court's other cases are where the address is very

12 easily ascertainable or readily available or at hand

13 versus where it's not. And unless the Court is going

14 to say, well, that line has to be -- it's going to

15 overrule cases that -- that have actually drawn that

16 line, such as Mullane itself that permitted publication

17 notice to some people, then I think the result follows

18 here that when the notice came back unclaimed, that was

19 -- the State was permitted to go ahead with the sale.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mullane, as Mr.

21 Kirkpatrick pointed out, involved masses of people.

22 This was a common trust fund, and the reliance was on

23 that a goodly number of them would get notice and they

24 were kind of stand-ins for the ones who didn't. But

25 here, we're dealing with a single individual.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

56

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FELDMAN: Right. That's true, but the

2 Court has also permitted notice by publication where

3 other -- I mean, it has always drawn the line of notice

4 of publication versus notice by mail at where the

5 address is very easily ascertainable.

6 But I would say that what -- the government's

7 interest, the most important interest here, is in

8 knowing what it's supposed to do. If you -- if there's

9 an open-ended standard that says, well, it just has to

10 keep doing something, then either it's -- well, then

11 the result of that predictably is going to be the

12 government is going to never be able to be satisfied

13 unless it gives in-hand notice or --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't -- why isn't the

15 simple answer to that concern to say, look, there's no

16 way to tell in advance or, you know, by any general

17 rule, at least not legislatively, how far they've got

18 to go to try to find the correct address, but they know

19 where the house is and they've got at that point to go

20 to the house and put a notice on the door? That's

21 simple, easy. Why -- why isn't that the answer?

22 MR. FELDMAN: May I respond to that?

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.

24 MR. FELDMAN: I just have two quick things.

25 One is in the Greene against Lindsey case and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

57

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- I can't remember the name of the other case. In the

2 Greene against Lindsey case, the Court said that --

3 that kind of notice has its own problems. The IRS and

4 State authorities have had problems with posting notice

5 in cases where the owners are not often happy to see

6 agents from the government trying to collect

7 taxes. That can actually be rather expensive.

8 And the Arkansas Supreme Court itself said

9 that the State itself frequently doesn't have the

10 address for the property. It has only the legal

11 description and it would be a significant burden to

12 find it.

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

14 Feldman.

15 Mr. Kirkpatrick, you have 4 minutes

16 remaining.

17 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL T. KIRKPATRICK

18 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19 MR. KIRKPATRICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief

20 Justice.

21 First, I'd just like to point out that it

22 absolutely is in the State's interest to provide the

23 best notice practicable for three reasons.

24 First, redemption of property by the owner is

25 the most efficient and cost effective means for the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

58

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

1 State to collect the back taxes.

2 Second, the State has an interest in

3 protecting its citizens from a loss of assets in

4 equity, like what was lost by Mr. Jones here.

5 And third, if notice is received because of

6 follow-up efforts or if the State can show that it has

7 made follow-up efforts, then it will not face

8 challenges based on inadequate notice.

9 In terms of the feasibility of doing

10 something more, the question was raised about other

11 States. Certainly many States do more. We've listed

12 about five or six States that actually have a statutory

13 scheme that deals with what happens when initial mailed

14 notice comes back. And in footnote 9 and footnote 10

15 of the reply brief, we indicate States that require

16 posting and States that require notice to occupants.

17 Justice Souter, with regard to your question

18 about the cost of tracking down a better address or

19 providing notice, those costs can be passed on to the

20 redeemer or purchaser of the property. And if we look

21 at the statute dealing with notice to homestead owners,

22 it says that where the mail does not work, the

23 additional cost of the notice by personal service of

24 process will be paid by the owner of the homestead who

25 redeems. So certainly they could pass along those

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

59

Washington, DC 20005

1 costs. They could pass along the costs of searching

2 for a better address just like we do in the Freedom of

3 Information Act context when we charge for Government

4 employee time to search for records.

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With -- with respect

6 to the fact that your client did not alert the State to

7 its change of address, is there anything in the record

8 about whether that his separation was permanent or is

9 that a gradual thing? I mean, did he not know if this

10 was a permanent change of address or what?

11 MR. KIRKPATRICK: There's nothing in the

12 record about that, Your Honor, but certainly when he

13 first moved out, he did not know what the future would

14 hold in terms of the length of that separation.

15 Now, it -- it is also not in the record, but

16 he did, in fact, file a change of address form, a

17 forwarding form, but it had long expired before these

18 certified letters came. That was actually a mistake on

19 the part of the letter carrier not to say, forwarding

20 order expired. And while a forwarding order is only

21 good for 18 months, there is the national change of

22 address database which reveals those things for a

23 period of 4 years. So that's something else the State

24 could have checked.

25 Also, this is not an attack on Dusenbery.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

60

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

1 This would be Dusenbery all over again if Mrs. Jones

2 had signed for the letter and the State had gotten back

3 the green card saying that letter was received by

4 somebody at 717 North Bryan Street. Then it would be

5 Dusenbery. This is not Dusenbery because the

6 difference is in Dusenbery they knew that the letter

7 was actually received at the facility where Mr.

8 Dusenbery was incarcerated. Here, the State actually

9 knew that the letter had never been received.

10 With regard to value of the property, that

11 $80,000 figure is not picked out of the air. It's

12 true, as Mr. Phillips said, that the parties stipulated

13 that that was the market value of the property, but in

14 fact, by statute -- and that's Arkansas Code Annotated

15 section 26-26-303 -- the assessed value of property

16 cannot exceed 20 percent of the market value. The

17 minimum bid was the assessed value, plus the interest,

18 plus the penalties, plus the costs of notice. Ms.

19 Flowers, in her negotiated purchase offer, made the

20 minimum bid plus $200.

21 With regard to the fact that the letter came

22 back unclaimed, I'd just like to point out that it -- I

23 see my time is up.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may finish.

25 MR. KIRKPATRICK: That it was not marked

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

61

1 refused. So it did not indicate that somebody saw the

2 letter and didn't want to take it.

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

4 The case is submitted.

6 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
