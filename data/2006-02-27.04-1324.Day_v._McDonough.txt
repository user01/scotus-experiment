2 [11:02 a.m.]

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

4 next in 04-1324, Day versus McDonough.

5 Mr. Busby.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. BRETT BUSBY

7 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8 MR. BUSBY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10 The State does not dispute that it waived

11 the affirmative defense of limitations by failing to

12 raise it in the District Court and by conceding in its

13 answer that Day's petition was timely. Yet, nearly a

14 year into the case, after the parties had briefed the

15 merits, the magistrate judge not only raised an

16 argument that the petition was untimely, he actually

17 imposed the State's limitations defense and dismissed

18 the case, despite the State's procedural default and

19 contrary concession.

20 That was error, for two reasons. First, it

21 violates the general principle of the adversary system

22 in the civil rules that it's error to impose a

23 forfeited limitations defense sua sponte, and the

24 statutory text in rules have confirmed that this

25 principle applies to habeas. Second, the State's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 concession of timeliness based on full information was

2 an express binding waiver, and it was error for the

3 District Court to override that concession.

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was a computation

5 error. This is not a -- this is not a case where the

6 State chose to waive the statute of limitations. It

7 miscalculated. Isn't that the case?

8 MR. BUSBY: Well, there was a 1-day

9 miscalculation, Justice Ginsburg, on the -- on the 352

10 versus 353 days before the -- Mr. Day filed his State

11 postconviction petition. But there's a legal dispute

12 as to whether the days after -- between the time --

13 whether the --

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're not -- and we

15 didn't take cert to decide if this claim was timely.

16 We are on the assumption that it was untimely. But --

17 and what are the consequences of the State's failing

18 to raise that?

19 MR. BUSBY: Well, our position is that by

20 expressly conceding in their petition that it was

21 timely, that that's an express waiver. I mean, they

22 say that they would have -- what they would have had

23 to say was, "We know we have a limitations defense.

24 We're expressly giving that up, that the proper

25 standard is the intentional relinquishment of" --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the --


2 MR. BUSBY: -- "a known right." 


3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the whole basis was 


4 the number of days that they calculated, and the

5 magistrate said, "Oh, they miscalculated. There were

6 more days involved."

7 MR. BUSBY: The -- yes, under Eleventh

8 Circuit law, the magistrate said they should have

9 counted that additional time at the end.

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

11 MR. BUSBY: But this Court has said that the

12 standard for -- the standard for express waiver

13 varies, depending on the right at stake. It's not

14 always intentional relinquishment of a known right, as

15 it is with some constitutional rights.

16 In fact, there are several Courts of Appeals

17 that have said when you plead -- when you

18 affirmatively plead the opposite of an affirmative

19 defense, as they did here by saying it's timely, that

20 that's enough for an express waiver. And --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose --

22 MR. BUSBY: -- this Court --

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the magistrate

24 judge had said, "I notice this error in accordance

25 with Eleventh Circuit law, so I am going to suggest to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the State that they amend their answer." The State

2 certainly could -- under Rule 15, if the Federal rules

3 apply, the State could have amended its answer and

4 done just what the magistrate judge did.

5 MR. BUSBY: Well, certainly, Your Honor,

6 they could have moved to amend their answer. We would

7 have opposed it; and would, on remand, if the issue

8 were to come up, on the ground that they had full

9 information, and so that this is not an appropriate

10 case to amend an answer. But I agree with you that

11 that would have been one option, and that's the way

12 that the Third Circuit analyzes this issue in the Long

13 case and in the Bendolph case, using the principles of

14 Rule 15. The Fifth -- the Eleventh Circuit did not do

15 that here. It said that there was an obligation for

16 the court to impose the limitations defense; it did

17 not apply the Rule 15 --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I --

19 MR. BUSBY: -- analysis.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did it say "an

21 obligation," or that the court "could"? It didn't --

22 I didn't think it said the court "must."

23 MR. BUSBY: It did say, Your Honor, that

24 there was an obligation for the court to impose it to

25 further comity, finality, and federalism, and that can

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 be found on page 5(a) of the appendix to the petition,

2 "A Federal Court that sits in collateral review has an

3 obligation to enforce the Federal statute of

4 limitations." And, in fact, they quote the Advisory

5 Committee notes to Rule 4, saying the court has the

6 duty to screen out. And they also expressly

7 distinguished their precedent in Esslinger versus

8 Davis, which relied on Granberry versus Greer, to say

9 it was a discretionary analysis. They said, "We're

10 not going to consider the discretionary issues raised

11 in Esslinger and Granberry whether this dismissal

12 would serve an important Federal interest. We're just

13 going to say there's an obligation to impose this, and

14 that the District" --

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is -- I see --

16 you're referring to page 4(a) and --

17 MR. BUSBY: 5(a), Your Honor.

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. Which -- where is

19 the sentence that says it -- that --

20 MR. BUSBY: The obligation is seven lines

21 from the bottom, and it's that last paragraph, where

22 they're distinguishing Esslinger. And the sentence of

23 the previous paragraph is where they say there's a

24 "duty."

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that that duty

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 is in connection with Rule 4.

2 MR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor, and then they -

3 - they rely on that duty to say that there is an

4 obligation, in the next paragraph, and to

5 distinguishing Essingler and say, "We don't have to go

6 through this discretionary analysis, because there's

7 an obligation."

8 And so, our position is that even --

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, the -- it's right that

10 there's an obligation if it notices it in the first

11 instance on its first review.

12 MR. BUSBY: Well, we don't necessarily

13 agree, Your Honor, if -- we don't necessarily agree

14 that --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And suppose, under the

16 review proceedings, that District Court is looking at

17 it for the first time, without yet having required a

18 response, and he sees a statute of limitation. I

19 assume there's an obligation.

20 MR. BUSBY: Under Rule 4? 


21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Sure. 


22 MR. BUSBY: Well, Your Honor, if you'd look 


23 at what rule --

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, if -- suppose it's

25 an open-and-shut violation of the statute of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 limitations, or barred by the statute of limitations -

2-

3 MR. BUSBY: Uh-huh.

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- does District Court

5 have discretion to refer to the State for a response?

6 MR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor, we would say

7 that --

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Really?

9 MR. BUSBY: -- that they must do that,

10 because, as this Court recognized in Pliler versus

11 Ford, it's almost never apparent on the face of the

12 petition --

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, my --

14 MR. BUSBY: -- that there's an --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, my --

16 MR. BUSBY: -- open-and-shut --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- my hypothetical is that

18 it is.

19 MR. BUSBY: Okay. I would think that even

20 if it were apparent on the face of the petition, that

21 the -- Rule 4 has two parts. In the first part of it,

22 the nonadversary screening function, only applies when

23 the petitioner is plainly not entitled to relief. And

24 I think the better view of that -- of that clause is -

25 - although there are some arguments in our brief that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 don't take this view -- I -- after having given it

2 thought, I think the better view of that clause is

3 that it does not apply to an affirmative defense

4 that's subject to waiver or tolling, that you can't

5 say, based on an affirmative defense that's subject to

6 waiver or tolling, that someone is plainly not

7 entitled to relief. You could say, for example --

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because the other --

9 because the other side might make a mistake and not

10 recognize it?

11 MR. BUSBY: Or it might be tolled, Your

12 Honor. And there are also four different trigger

13 dates in the statute for when it can first apply, that

14 you aren't going to be able to tell, necessarily,

15 three of them from the face of the petition.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or the other side may say,

17 "Although technically the statute of limitations

18 applied here, taking all considerations into account

19 we think that this prisoner acted with reasonable

20 promptness, and perhaps the delay was somewhat

21 attributable to the State." Do you think that that's

22 a proper consideration?

23 MR. BUSBY: Absolutely, Your Honor. There -

24 - the statute of limitations in AEDPA is designed to

25 prevent delay, not to -- as Congress has said, it's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 not a forfeiture provision; it's designed to move

2 these complaints along speedily, particularly in

3 capital cases, of which this is not one.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- it could be

5 argued that the Federal Government wants to move them

6 along speedily, whether or not the State government

7 wants to.

8 MR. BUSBY: Certainly. And their --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, that would suggest that

10 the State's voluntary waiver of a statute of

11 limitations should not make any difference. It's a

12 Federal -- it's a Federal interest involved, not a

13 State interest.

14 MR. BUSBY: Well, they -- there is an

15 interest in judicial efficiency that's at issue here,

16 too, but we submit that it's far more inefficient for

17 the Court to put limitations under this first category

18 of Rule 4 and say that the Court must, on its own,

19 look at limitations every time, without assistance

20 from the parties, than it is to make the State do its

21 job. I mean, they're the ones, as this --

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we could --

23 MR. BUSBY: -- Court recognized --

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- we could -- we could

25 agree with you that there is isn't an obligation on

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the Federal judge to raise it, but the question is,

2 you know, the -- it could be a "must," it can be "may

3 not," or it could be "may."

4 MR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor.

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And why shouldn't we

6 treat this as a "may"? The judge noticed the clerical

7 error and called it to the party's attention by an

8 order to show cause.

9 MR. BUSBY: Well, the proper procedure under

10 Rule 4 is not to call it to the party's attention in

11 that way; it's --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We're past Rule 4,

13 because an answer has been ordered.

14 MR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor.

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- and it's only when

16 the answer comes in that this issue is spotted.

17 MR. BUSBY: Yes. That's correct. And I

18 agree with you that the proper procedure after that

19 would be to bring the issue to the party's attention

20 and let the State decide whether it wanted to file a

21 motion to amend under Rule 15; and, if it did so,

22 there are very clear standards that are applied, that

23 were not applied in this case, to decide --

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are very what

25 standards?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BUSBY: There are very clear standards,

2 Your Honor --

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, "leave shall be

4 freely given."

5 MR. BUSBY: Yes, but there are also -- it's

6 a -- again, it's a discretionary determination, and

7 there are prejudice issues that should be considered

8 as the --

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what would be the

10 prejudice that could be claimed by the habeas

11 petitioner?

12 MR. BUSBY: Well, the prejudice in this case

13 is that the standards of Rule 15 were not considered;

14 but, in addition, there are -- there are well-

15 recognized decisions, both from this Court and from

16 the Courts of Appeals, that went -- that says a judge

17 may deny leave to amend when the -- at the time the

18 concession is made. And the answer -- the State had

19 full information. And the State admits here that it

20 had all the information it needed to make the

21 limitations calculation attached to its answer, in

22 which it conceded timeliness, and then -- but then

23 waited a year, or several months, to bring it up

24 later. And so, we would argue, if this were a Rule 15

25 analysis, that it would not be appropriate for the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Court to allow the amendment.

2 JUSTICE ALITO: Are you --

3 MR. BUSBY: Now, also --

4 JUSTICE ALITO: Are you saying that the

5 error is simply that it wasn't done via Rule 15? What

6 if we were to say that the same considerations apply

7 when it's simply raised sua sponte by the -- by the --

8 by the District Court? What would be your objection

9 to that?

10 MR. BUSBY: Well, that would be -- that's

11 the Respondent's position, and I think, in addition to

12 those considerations, if you disagree that this is a

13 forfeiture, that -- and you disagree that this is an

14 express waiver, and you get to their position that,

15 you know, this is a discretionary test and you should

16 just apply the same Rule 15 factors, I think you need

17 to also apply a presumption against sua sponte

18 consideration.

19 There's one way to do it under Rule 4, and

20 that's the most efficient way. It's also the way that

21 comports with judicial neutrality in the adversary

22 system. And so, to encourage people --

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you couldn't do this

24 under Rule 4, because, as you, I think, recognized,

25 that, just from the petition, from the habeas

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 petition, you couldn't tell.

2 MR. BUSBY: I'm sorry, Justice --

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There wasn't --

4 MR. BUSBY: -- Ginsburg, I misspoke. I

5 meant to say Rule 15. But if -- to encourage parties

6 to do this under Rule 15, the Court should adopt a

7 presumption against sua sponte consideration. And

8 this -- in Arizona versus California, which they rely

9 on heavily, they say that this type of consideration

10 should be reserved for rare circumstances. And we

11 cite several cases in our brief where that -- that

12 also support that proposition. So, we would submit,

13 if you do get to this analysis, Justice Alito, that

14 there should also be a presumption involved.

15 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if you think it's --

16 if it's done under Rule 15, would the considerations

17 necessarily be exactly the same in a habeas case as in

18 an ordinary civil case?

19 MR. BUSBY: Not necessarily. I mean, there

20 -- but we do submit that the timing issue that we just

21 raised, about them having full information, would

22 certainly be something we'd argue to the District

23 Court in its discretion. But another thing you have

24 to consider, to your point, is that limitations is

25 something that's -- that has a subtle meaning and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 derive -- and is directly addressed by Civil Rules 8

2 and 12. And this Court, in Gonzalez and Mayle, says

3 that when that happens, that's where you start, with

4 the civil rules. And then you ask if there's anything

5 in the habeas statutes or rules that's inconsistent

6 with that approach, with the -- with the forfeiture

7 approach of the civil rules.

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the civil rules

9 allow for amendment.

10 MR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's 8(c), and there's

12 12(b), but there's also 15.

13 MR. BUSBY: Yes, I agree. And that was not

14 used in this case. I -- and I -- we agree that that

15 would be an appropriate way to raise this.

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It seems the height of

17 technicality to say that the judge could suggest,

18 "Now, State, I will entertain a motion to amend the

19 answer, under Rule 15," instead of saying, "I'm

20 issuing an order to show cause why this action is not

21 out of time."

22 MR. BUSBY: Well, I don't agree, Your Honor,

23 because there's a specific analysis that goes along

24 with Rule 15 that wasn't applied here. But, in

25 addition to that, there's an efficiency interest to be

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 served by having the State calculate and make the

2 motion, rather than putting the burden on the Federal

3 Court to do it. The Court, we submit, should make the

4 State -- they -- this Court, in Pliler, said the

5 State's in the best position to make the limitations

6 calculation. It's an error-prone fact-intensive,

7 burdensome calculation, and they shouldn't be allowed

8 to foist that burden on the Court. The Court should

9 make them do their job.

10 And so, our position is that that's the

11 reason that it should be done under Rule 15. It also

12 doesn't put the State in the position of being an

13 advocate -- excuse me -- it doesn't put the Court in

14 the position of being an advocate for the State and

15 having them say -- having the Court directly across

16 the bench from the Petitioner, not involving the

17 State, saying, "Here are -- I'm developing some

18 arguments on behalf of the State now why this is

19 untimely. What do you have to say about it?" That's

20 --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does -- proceeding

22 under 15 does not do that; whereas, proceeding this

23 way does?

24 MR. BUSBY: Well, proceeding under 15, I --

25 proceeding under 15, you would say to the State, "Do

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you want to make a motion to amend?"

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wink, wink?

3 MR. BUSBY: Well -- but --

4 [Laughter.]

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, there is some value

6 in that, I think, particularly where the State has

7 expressly conceded timeliness. I mean, the magistrate

8 judge in this case, all that he had before him was the

9 express concession from the State. He never -- the

10 State never said anything in the District Court, even

11 after he issued his notice to the Petitioner to show

12 cause why it wasn't untimely. So, the magistrate

13 judge, all he had before him was the State's position

14 that it was timely.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that concern

16 present in Granberry, as well? And yet, the Court

17 reached the opposite result there.

18 MR. BUSBY: I don't think so, Your Honor,

19 because in Granberry the State raised the issue for

20 the first time on appeal, the court did not. So,

21 there, you do have the adversary system at work. In

22 addition, Granberry is different for several other

23 reasons. Exhaustions is, unlike limitations, unique

24 to habeas corpus; it's not covered by Rule 8. And,

25 also, it's a common-law limit that this Court has

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 developed on habeas relief. It's not a statutory

2 affirmative defense. And, as our brief points out,

3 Congress has treated these very differently when it

4 codified them in AEDPA. And this applies not only to

5 exhaustion, but nonretroactivity, abuse of the writ,

6 and procedural default. I'm sorry, procedural default

7 was not codified. But they other defenses -- the

8 other limits on habeas relief that the Petitioner

9 relies on were codified very differently in AEDPA;

10 whereas, for exhaustion it says, "Relief shall not be

11 granted unless you exhaust." That's a substantive

12 limit on relief.

13 For limitations, however, it says when

14 you're --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One that requires

16 the court to raise it sua sponte, even if it's not

17 raised by the State.

18 MR. BUSBY: I beg your pardon?

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One that requires

20 the court to raise it sua sponte, even if not raised

21 by the State, correct?

22 MR. BUSBY: Potentially, yes, if you codify

23 it as a substantive limit on relief. Whereas,

24 limitations is simply codified -- it says, "a period

25 of limitations shall apply." It doesn't say, "Relief

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 shall not be granted unless you file within one year."

2 It doesn't even say, as it does in the capital

3 context, for certain -- for capital opt-in States,

4 that it must be filed by a certain time. It just says

5 "a period of limitation." And that has a settled

6 meaning that goes along with it.

7 JUSTICE BREYER: Your position is, it should

8 be like any other civil case.

9 MR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor. And --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: You can raise it sua

11 sponte, we've said, in exceptional circumstances.

12 MR. BUSBY: Yes.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know what they are.

14 MR. BUSBY: Well, I --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: And if --

16 MR. BUSBY: -- I'm not --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: -- they're not there --

18 MR. BUSBY: One --

19 JUSTICE BREYER: -- then the judge could

20 say, "You know, I'm surprised that you haven't raised

21 statute of limitations."

22 MR. BUSBY: Uh-huh.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: And then the lawyer for the

24 State says, "Oh, my goodness. Quite right. We'd like

25 to amend."

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BUSBY: Certainly.

2 JUSTICE BREYER: And we don't --

3 MR. BUSBY: And there could be --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: -- have to decide --

5 MR. BUSBY: -- good reasons to amend. For

6 example, the Bendolph case that you have before you,

7 there was an alteration in a date, and the Third

8 Circuit didn't ascribe that to any particular person,

9 but, nonetheless, the documents that the State had

10 before it had the wrong date on it from which to

11 calculate.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Must there be good reasons

13 for the judge to say, quote, "I'm surprised that you

14 haven't raised a statute of limitations defense"?

15 MR. BUSBY: Well, I --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Must there be good reason

17 for that? And, if not, aren't you asking us to waste

18 our time?

19 MR. BUSBY: I don't think so.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't you do it the

21 easier way and --

22 MR. BUSBY: I don't think so, Your Honor.

23 You're -- if you put -- if you put limitations as

24 something that the judge must raise, I think you're

25 asking the judge to waste his time rather than leaving

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it to the parties to raise it.

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what's your answer as

3 to whether there is any limitation on the judge just

4 suggesting, "By the way, you know, is there some

5 reason why you haven't pleaded statute of

6 limitations?" Can a -- can a judge do that?

7 MR. BUSBY: Well, I would think that, you

8 know, it would be evaluated under an abuse-of-

9 discretion standard, and I haven't -- I haven't given

10 much --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: And what -- when would it

12 be an abuse of discretion?

13 MR. BUSBY: For a judge to --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

15 MR. BUSBY: -- invite the State to amend?

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

17 MR. BUSBY: I would say if -- it would be,

18 in this case, perhaps, because of the State's express

19 concession to the contrary, and -- so that that might

20 be one circumstance. But I don't think this --

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it wouldn't --

22 MR. BUSBY: -- Court needs to --

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- be an abuse of --

24 MR. BUSBY: -- circumscribe --

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It wouldn't be an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 abuse of discretion for him to suggest an amendment if

2 he's got the opportunity to rule on the amendment

3 later on. And then presumably the ruling would be

4 reviewed for abuse of discretion.

5 MR. BUSBY: That's a good point, Your Honor.

6 I don't think this Court needs to circumscribe the

7 judge's authority to suggest an amendment. I think

8 you could wrap it all into the ruling and evaluate

9 that for abuse of discretion.

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: I suppose it might be an

11 abuse of discretion if you'd already had a hearing and

12 took -- and decided that there was merit to the

13 plaintiff's claim, and then decided, "Well, now I'm

14 going to just throw it out on limitations," might be

15 an abuse of discretion.

16 MR. BUSBY: I would agree with that, yes,

17 Your Honor.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why

19 doesn't that same standard apply to the decision of

20 the Court to raise it sua sponte?

21 MR. BUSBY: Well, because in this case you

22 have an express concession. And so, it's a -- this

23 Court has said, and other courts have said, that when

24 you have an express concession, it's error to override

25 that concession and impose the defense sua sponte.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 The Court should, instead, assume that the concession

2 is valid and that refusal to honor it is an abuse of

3 discretion. You --

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Were those --

5 MR. BUSBY: -- don't want to strip --

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- cases -- were those

7 cases of a miscalculation on the part of the State?

8 The judge's view was that the State had miscalculated

9 under eleventh-amendment -- under Eleventh Circuit

10 precedent.

11 MR. BUSBY: Well, Your Honor, most of those

12 cases involved other issues, like exhaustion and

13 procedural default, where the State later came back

14 and said, "We were mistaken that they exhausted," or,

15 "We were mistaken that they didn't procedurally

16 default this claim." So, it's a similar mistake

17 claim, but, nonetheless, the State affirmatively

18 pleaded the opposite of either exhaustion, procedural

19 default, or limitations. And the court held them to

20 that.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you'd say it would be

22 okay if the State didn't expressly concede the statute

23 of limitations point.

24 MR. BUSBY: Possibly. But, again, I think

25 if you -- if you use the analysis of the civil rules

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that applies here, by virtue of Civil Rule 81 and

2 Habeas Rule 11, that it's error -- our first position

3 is that it's error to override the forfeiture --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's --

5 MR. BUSBY: -- except in --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought your

7 --

8 MR. BUSBY: Yes. 


9 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- position was. 


10 MR. BUSBY: Except in exceptional --


11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So, this --


12 MR. BUSBY: -- circumstances. 


13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- a fallback position. 


14 MR. BUSBY: Yes. That's correct. And then 


15 our second fallback position is that even if Your --

16 even if Your Honors agree that the court could -- has

17 discretion to override the express waiver, that

18 there's at least a discretionary analysis that has to

19 apply under Civil Rule 15 that's coupled with a

20 presumption in -- against sua sponte dismissal that

21 the Eleventh Circuit didn't apply here.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: Why, just out of curiosity

23 -- I'm not familiar with the actual practice of a lot

24 of civil cases, but when somebody -- let's say the

25 defendant in an ordinary tort case forgets to put in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the statute of limitations, and the case is all tried

2 and finished. At the very end, he says, "Oh, my God."

3 And now he goes in and asks to amend it under Rule

4 15.  Do judges normally say, "Fine"?

5 MR. BUSBY: I -- they normally say no, that

6 that's --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: Because it's --

8 MR. BUSBY: The -- because the case has gone

9 on down the road on another theory, and it's

10 prejudicial to the parties, and it wastes -- it's a

11 waste of the court's judicial resources to --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But here, nothing --

13 MR. BUSBY: -- bring it up.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- happened. Nothing

15 happened. There was --

16 MR. BUSBY: Well --

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The answer was put in,

18 and then there were no further proceedings. Nothing

19 else went on in the court.

20 MR. BUSBY: Well --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's quite different -- I

22 don't know any judge that would allow a defendant,

23 after the trial is over, to raise the statute of

24 limitations. But, up front, it's a different

25 situation.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BUSBY: Well, we disagree that this was

2 up front, Your Honor. The answer in a -- habeas

3 corpus cases, of course, heavily deals with the

4 merits, as it did in this case. And then, Mr. Day

5 replied. And, as the State's amicus brief points out,

6 that's all that usually happens in most habeas corpus

7 cases. So, we were near the end of the proceeding, as

8 -- if you think of the run-of-the-mine habeas corpus

9 case.

10 And, also, speaking of run-of-the-mine

11 habeas corpus cases, this is a very rare instance.

12 There are -- there are lots of procedures for courts

13 to vindicate the interest that the State describes in

14 comity, finality, and federalism, whether inviting a

15 motion to -- whether ordering the State to file a

16 motion to dismiss under Rule 4, which we submit would

17 be the proper procedure, or, if the State fails to

18 raise it in its answer in certain circumstances,

19 inviting them to file a motion to amend under Rule 15.

20 That takes care of these interests in the run-of-the-

21 mine case.

22 There's no need to vindicate those interests

23 in this case by creating an exception to the rules.

24 This Court has said, in Lonchar and in Carlisle, that

25 where there are civil rules that deal with the -- and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 habeas rules -- that deal with how these things

2 happen, the Court cannot use its inherent powers to

3 circumvent those rules. And we submit that that's

4 exactly what the court did here.

5 Now, in addition, I'd like to point the

6 Court to New York versus Hill, which is not cited in

7 our briefs, but can be found at 528 U.S. at 114 to -15

8 and also 118, on this express waiver issue. And this

9 is a case where the Court recognized exactly the point

10 that we make here, that not all -- you don't always

11 have to show intentional relinquishment of a known

12 right for that to be the standard for waiver. It

13 depends on the right at issue. There, it was an

14 International Agreement on Detainers Act case, and the

15 Court held that the -- that the defendant's assent to

16 delay waived the time limitation of the Interstate

17 Agreement on Detainers Act, expressly waived it. And

18 that's our -- that's our position here, is that the

19 State's affirmative pleading of timeliness is an

20 express waiver.

21 In addition, the State could -- certainly

22 couldn't prevail, under the Brady versus U.S. standard

23 that applies to plea agreements, for saying that its

24 concession was not knowing. There's no -- there's no

25 suggestion here that the State was misled. There's no

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 suggestion that they didn't have all the information

2 they needed to make the calculation. And Brady says

3 that simply misapprehending a factor -- a relevant

4 factor in the analysis is not enough. And that's at

5 397 U.S. at page 757.

6 In addition, the State makes an argument

7 about policies beyond the concerns of the parties, and

8 that the State -- that those should be vindicated in

9 this case. But I'd like to point out that this Court

10 has not adopted the "beyond the concerns of the

11 parties" test; rather, it's acknowledged that Congress

12 entrusts even important public policies, like comity,

13 finality, and federalism, to the adversary process;

14 and, thus, their -- and even private rights that

15 benefit society can be waived, in Christiansburg

16 Garment, for example.

17 With the Court's permission, I'd like to

18 reserve the balance of my time.

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.

20 Mr. Kise.

21 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER M. KISE

22 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

23 MR. KISE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

24 please the Court:

25 The District Court's sua sponte action here

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 was consistent with AEDPA and the habeas rules. It

2 was consistent with this Court's habeas jurisprudence.

3 And it was consistent with the purpose behind, and

4 not prohibited by, Federal Rules 8 and 12.

5 This case is not about the State's waiver.

6 And we would agree that -- with Justice Scalia, that

7 the waiver is not the beginning and end of it. We're

8 not conceding that the State, in fact, waived it here,

9 but we're saying that that's not essential to the

10 answer to this question, because it's not the

11 beginning and the end of the analysis.

12 This case is also not about, as the

13 Petitioner alleges in the brief and makes inference on

14 the Eleventh Circuit's opinion, about obligating

15 courts to act in all circumstances.

16 This case is about the proper exercise of

17 discretion. And what we're really asking this Court

18 to do is really three things: to acknowledge again

19 that this authority exists, to say that this is when

20 the court may exercise that authority under the

21 circumstances presented by this case, And then,

22 thirdly, that this is how the Court goes about

23 exercising this authority, by providing notice and

24 opportunity to be heard, and conducting an analysis of

25 prejudice. And --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think the court "must."

2 MR. KISE: No, Your Honor.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, don't you think

4 that's what this court thought? And, if so, shouldn't

5 we perhaps send it back to see whether, if the court

6 knew that it had discretion, it would have done this?

7 MR. KISE: Your Honor, respectfully, I don't

8 think that that's what the Eleventh Circuit thought.

9 I think that that is an interpretation of the Eleventh

10 Circuit's language. However, I think that where the

11 phrase that Counsel pointed to in the opinion -- on

12 page 5(a), referencing "obligation" -- I believe that

13 the Court there was referring to, specifically under

14 Rule 4, that the court has this obligation. I think

15 it -- because it's in that discussion that the Court

16 is talking about the obligation. And I would submit

17 that, indeed, under Rule 4, in response, I believe, to

18 Justice -- a point Justice Kennedy raised, I would say

19 that, under Rule 4, I think it is obligation. I think

20 what Rule 4 is, is a reflection of Congress -- excuse

21 me -- of the rule advising the court that, "You must

22 exercise this authority that you already have at this

23 particular time. This is the time when you need to be

24 looking for these things."

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but, Mr. Kise, the -

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 - Mr. Busby told us that the reference was in the

2 following paragraph, and it is the sentence, "A

3 Federal Court that sits in collateral review of a

4 criminal judgment of a State Court has an obligation

5 to enforce the Federal statute of limitations."

6 That's the sentence that suggests that the Court of

7 Appeals thought that there was an obligation, the

8 District Court, to raise the statute of limitations on

9 its own motion.

10 MR. KISE: Your Honor -- and I was referring

11 to that sentence, and perhaps I wasn't clear, but I

12 would -- I would say that they are still talking about

13 Rule 4. But even if they're not talking about Rule 4,

14 even if, in fact, this Court believes that the

15 District -- that the Circuit Court's analysis is

16 flawed, then we must keep in mind that this Court is

17 reviewing judgments, not opinions. And this Court

18 could easily do what it did in Gonzalez, which is,

19 even though the analysis is not consistent with what

20 this Court -- I mean, frankly, if the Court takes that

21 view with what we're asking the Court to do here --

22 but you can nevertheless affirm the judgment. Because

23 the District Court did, in fact, get it right. The --

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: What --

25 MR. KISE: -- District Court --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: What would you say --

2 assuming that we're beyond Rule 4, what would you say

3 simply to a rule that said, "Yes, we recognize that

4 there remains a discretion -- not an obligation, but a

5 discretion -- on the part of the court to raise this."

6 But, just as a -- as a general rule, judicial

7 efficiency is better served by avoiding the use of

8 discretion unless the State, in fact, raises the

9 limitations issue, itself. The courts have a lot of

10 things to do, and they shouldn't be spending their

11 time canvassing pleadings to see whether there might

12 be an issue that the State missed; so that in the

13 absence of some extraordinary circumstance, it would

14 be an abuse of discretion to exercise it as the -- as

15 the Circuit suggests it should have been exercised

16 here. What would you say to that position?

17 MR. KISE: I would say, respectfully, Your

18 Honor, that that is somewhat inconsistent, if not

19 entirely inconsistent, with what this Court said in

20 Granberry and Caspari, dealing with the same sort of

21 raising of affirmative defenses. From that

22 standpoint, from a procedural standpoint, I would say

23 that Granberry and Caspari are procedurally

24 indistinct, in that this Court said that it is

25 appropriate, in these circumstances, for the court to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 look at affirmative defenses. Obviously, they have

2 substantive differences, which my -- which Counsel has

3 pointed out, but, from a procedural standpoint, were

4 the Petitioner to prevail here, I would think this

5 Court needs to recede procedurally from Granberry and

6 Caspari --

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: What --

8 MR. KISE: -- because the Court --

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: What, then, would be the

10 significance here of the fact that the State conceded

11 that there was no limitations problem? In a case like

12 that, wouldn't it be a good rule to avoid judicial

13 inquiry?

14 MR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, I think that

15 the State's concession, as Justice Scalia pointed out,

16 is not the beginning and end of it, in the first

17 instance. Secondly, it --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it bears on the

19 exercise of discretion.

20 MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor, it does. And we

21 would agree that it bears on the exercise of

22 discretion. And, in a circumstance such as this one,

23 where the attachments, the record itself, indicated

24 that there was a discrepancy between the position the

25 State was taking and what the record actually

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 reflected, it was appropriate for the District Court

2 to raise the issue and then consider the interests of

3 the parties. If the District Court had been presented

4 simply with nothing in the record, just a blanket

5 statement by the -- by Florida that, "We concede," and

6 there was nothing to raise the question, then we would

7 -- we would say that it's not appropriate for the

8 court to simply pull issues out of the sky.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: That would be an abuse.

10 MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor. I would say

11 that it would be an abuse.

12 JUSTICE BREYER: District judges can't

13 comment on the cases? And -- they suddenly raise

14 something, curious about something; and, lo and

15 behold, it becomes the subject of an amendment.

16 MR. KISE: Well, Justice --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: That's a violation of -- I

18 mean, what I'm driving at is, I don't really

19 understand Rule 15 thoroughly, because I'm not a trial

20 lawyer. And why do we have to decide every matter?

21 Why don't we let the District judge free to run his

22 trial and just say, "Hey, we don't want to proliferate

23 law. It's complicated enough already. Let's leave it

24 to Rule 15, whatever that might be"?

25 MR. KISE: I think leaving it to Rule 15 is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 one way to do it. And doing it in these particular

2 cases is another way. Giving the courts discretion to

3 raise the --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but the other way

5 means we're now going to have a new area of law. The

6 new area of law consists of habeas law involving what

7 is the equivalent of an amendment suggested by the

8 judge to bring up a statute. That would be good,

9 because West would then have five more pages, with a

10 new keynote --

11 [Laughter.]

12 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and there would be more

13 for lawyers to look up. Whereas, if you just say Rule

14 15, it's finished.

15 MR. KISE: Respectfully, Your Honor, I

16 believe this Court's already done that, though, in

17 Granberry and Caspari. I mean, that's what you've

18 already said, is that, under -- that habeas is

19 different. And I think it's important to point out,

20 we're not asking for a different construction of Rules

21 8 and 12. We're asking this Court to apply the same

22 exception that is applied in the extraordinary case.

23 The Petitioner takes the position -- and Petitioner is

24 alone in this contention -- that "ordinarily" means

25 "never." Even the law professor amici don't take

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 position, and there is not a case that we have been

2 able to locate in the country that says that

3 "ordinarily" means "never," that --

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you say it's --

5 MR. KISE: -- the ordinary rule --

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- means it's "hardly

7 ever"? I mean, we do follow the principle of party

8 presentation. And judges are not supposed to be

9 intruding issues on their own, they are supposed to

10 follow the party's presentation. So, would this be --

11 if it's not "never," would it be at least "hardly

12 ever," that it's appropriate for a judge to interject

13 an affirmative defense on his own motion?

14 MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor, I would say that

15 it is "hardly ever," and that's what we're dealing

16 with here. It's what the Court was dealing with in

17 Granberry and Caspari, these limited circumstances

18 where the interests transcend the interests of just

19 the parties before the court and where it is, from the

20 -- from a review of the record, as District judges do

21 every day looking at the record and identifying

22 issues, and to avoid the sort of conundrum that's

23 presented by the Petitioner agreeing that the District

24 judge could simply look at the State and, as Justice

25 Scalia said, wink, wink, "It's okay for you to raise

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 this issue now," to avoid the roundabout that is

2 occasioned by that. If it is, in fact, permissible in

3 these circumstances for the District Court to raise

4 the issue, then doing it the way the court did it

5 here, and the way that was approved in Bendolph, and

6 the way that we believe the Eleventh Circuit approved

7 it, is entirely appropriate, because it's consistent

8 with what this Court said in its habeas jurisprudence.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if Congress wanted to

10 leave it to the State to waive the statute of

11 limitations provision? How could it have made that

12 clear? I mean, I would have thought that if they made

13 it a statute of limitations provision instead of a

14 jurisdictional provision -- I mean, they could have

15 said, you know, "No jurisdiction if it's filed beyond

16 a certain date, and we mean it." But it put it as a

17 statute of limitation, which normally is waivable.

18 And I would think that that is an indication that

19 Congress thought, "Really, if the State thinks that in

20 this particular case we shouldn't hew to the

21 technicality of the statute of limitation, the State

22 ought to be able to waive it.

23 MR. KISE: And I think that's why it is set

24 up the way it is, Your Honor, but it's just that the

25 waiver is not the beginning and end of it. For

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 example, where the State might wish to waive the

2 statute of limitations and simply move to the merits

3 would be in a situation where there might be some

4 complex argument over equitable tolling and where the

5 merits are relatively straightforward. Rather than

6 spending the court's time and the resources involved

7 and litigating over equitable tolling, the State might

8 simply say, "We realize that there is this

9 technicality here, but we're going to get to the

10 merits, because otherwise we're going to spend an

11 inordinate amount of time litigating."

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's always a

13 technicality. What you're saying is, the only time

14 that the State can do that is when the answer to the

15 statute of limitations is unclear. And I'm saying

16 sometimes the State may say, "The answer is clear, but

17 doggone it, this is just too picky-picky, too

18 technical in this particular case."

19 MR. KISE: And, Your Honor, our test allows

20 for that, as well. It's up to the District Court to

21 decide whether, in that particular case, the

22 circumstances require the application. There is some

23 discretion. I don't think that the State could --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it -- would it

25 always be an abuse of discretion for the District

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Court to do this if the State wanted to reach the

2 merits?

3 MR. KISE: I don't think so, Your Honor,

4 because it would depend on why the State wanted to

5 reach the merits. Perhaps the State was engaging in

6 some sort of gaming of the system, as Petitioner

7 alleges could happen. If there was, in fact, some

8 actual sandbagging going on, where the State is

9 holding this issue in reserve as a strategic matter,

10 and the District Court simply says, "No, we're not

11 going to allow that." And it would really be the same

12 analysis under Rule 15. If the court were to have

13 sandbagged, so to speak, under Rule 15 and waited to

14 file a late amendment, the court would engage in the

15 same analysis. The court would say, "Well, wait, do I

16 really want to permit the State, now, to assert this?"

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no question

18 of -- put aside a sandbagging case, there's no

19 question of sandbagging, and that the -- the State

20 just wants to litigate on the merits rather than on

21 the statute of limitations.

22 MR. KISE: It would not always be an abuse

23 of discretion. I --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, can

25 they have it -- would it be an abuse of discretion in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 an express waiver case as opposed to a forfeiture

2 case?

3 MR. KISE: I don't think that you could say,

4 in all circumstances -- no, Your Honor, it would not

5 be an abuse of discretion in all circumstances. But I

6 do think the District Court needs to factor in the

7 interests of the State and the reasons why the State

8 is willing to proceed forward. And if the State, for

9 example, is, as I believe an example was given by the

10 court, that the State is -- believes that, "Well,

11 perhaps it's appropriate to waive the statute here, or

12 to not rely on the statute here, because of something

13 maybe we have done, or that it -- the Petitioner

14 didn't -- missed the deadline by a certain period of

15 time, and we think that, in this particular case, it's

16 all right to reach those merits."

17 So, I can't -- I don't think we should say

18 that it's always an abuse of discretion, but I think

19 we need to leave it to District Courts to make that

20 determination, just as this Court did in Granberry and

21 Caspari. This Court gave District Courts that

22 discretion, because these are the types of cases where

23 that discretion is appropriate. This Court's already

24 identified that, in habeas cases, we are to treat

25 Rules 8 and 12 as the exception being applied, that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 these --

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought in Granberry

3 the Court gave the Court of Appeals that discretion,

4 since it hadn't -- the point had been missed in the

5 District Court, been missed by everybody, until the

6 Court of Appeals.

7 MR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, in fact, this

8 Court did give the Court of Appeals that discretion,

9 but even more so than we would give the District Court

10 that discretion, because, Why should we wait for the

11 process to get all the way to the Court of Appeals?

12 If this Court is going to say it's appropriate for the

13 Court of Appeals to look at an affirmative defense,

14 then certainly, in keeping with that reasoning, it

15 would be appropriate for a District Court to raise it

16 before we've gone through the entire process of

17 litigation in the District Court and then getting

18 ourselves to the Court of Appeals.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: You acknowledge at least

20 this much, or am I incorrect? And it's important for

21 me to know that. You acknowledge at least this much,

22 that if we read this opinion, as you do not, to be

23 saying that the court "must" do this so that the court

24 was not really considering all factors in the exercise

25 of its discretion, we would have to remand.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KISE: No, Your Honor, I would not, and

2 I'll tell you why I would not.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right.

4 MR. KISE: It's because, just as in

5 Gonzalez, the Court is not reviewing the opinion. The

6 Court is reviewing the judgment. And the --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why would --

8 MR. KISE: -- judgment is correct.

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- why would you deal

10 with that hypothetical when the Eleventh Circuit, in

11 all fairness, said, "We join the Second, Fourth,

12 Fifth, and Ninth Circuit, and rule that, even though

13 the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense,

14 the District Court may review the timeliness of the

15 2254." That's what -- the question that the court

16 thought it was deciding.

17 MR. KISE: I would agree that the court

18 thought it was deciding discretion, but I was

19 responding, I -- to what I thought was Justice

20 Scalia's question about, What if this Court does not

21 agree with that? If this Court believes that the

22 Eleventh Circuit, in fact, was applying an obligation

23 rule, a mandatory rule, then it would require remand.

24 And I -- what I'm saying, Your Honor, is -- is that

25 we would not, because the District Court applied the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 appropriate test. In the first instance, I would say

2 that the Eleventh Circuit did not, in fact, apply that

3 test, did not believe that it was obligated to, but if

4 this Court were to disagree, as Justice Scalia has

5 presented the hypothetical, then I would say that the

6 District Court did, in fact, apply the correct test.

7 The District Court, as noted in -- on page 8(a) of the

8 petition appendix, the footnote in the magistrate's

9 report and recommendation cites Jackson, the Eleventh

10 Circuit case which stands for the discretionary

11 proposition, and indicates specifically that it is

12 relying on a discretionary test. And so, the District

13 Court in this case, in fact, applied the test that we

14 are advocating, and in -- and, frankly, got it right.

15 The District Court applied discretion, raised the

16 issue, provided a notice and an opportunity to be

17 heard, conducted the analysis of prejudice -- there

18 was no prejudice in this case -- and ruled, on that

19 basis. And that ruling was consistent with this

20 Court's habeas jurisprudence, and it was consistent

21 with AEDPA and with the habeas rules.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why doesn't your

23 position on the underlying merits of the timeliness

24 question create an incentive for every habeas

25 petitioner to file a cert petition?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KISE: I'm not sure I follow your --

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you --

3 MR. KISE: -- your question, Your Honor.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you only get the

5 extra 90 days if you actually file, under your

6 explanation for why this cert petition is -- why this

7 habeas petition is untimely. In other words, if this

8 individual had filed a cert petition with us, his

9 petition -- his habeas petition would be timely. And

10 he's only going to get the extra period, as I

11 understand your position on the timeliness, if he

12 files a cert petition.

13 MR. KISE: I understand our position to be

14 that they do not get the 90 days, postconviction. And

15 if that is misstated in our brief -- but I --

16 certainly we're not attempting to encourage the filing

17 of cert petitions by habeas petitioners. And we

18 believe the statute provides for the 90 days,

19 postdirect review, but not after following State

20 postconviction. Once the State postconviction

21 proceedings are no longer pending, meaning that they

22 are completed for State purposes, not including the 90

23 days --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

25 MR. KISE: -- that's when they terminate.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 That is our position.

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if they file a

3 cert petition.

4 MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor.

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, doesn't that put

6 them in the position of sometimes having to file that

7 -- the habeas petition while the cert petition is

8 still pending, if they file one?

9 MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor, it might. It

10 does present that conundrum. But that's what the

11 statute provides. That is the way the statute has

12 provided for it. And we think that interpretation is

13 consistent, because there certainly -- as was

14 referenced in the first oral argument, there is some

15 expectation that the court might grant certiorari, but

16 it's not in the -- the likely case. And so, to

17 suspend the congressional purpose of moving these

18 cases through the system on the chance that the one in

19 a thousand, or perhaps more than one in a thousand,

20 case is granted certiorari would not be an appropriate

21 process to utilize. And I think the Circuit Courts

22 bear that out. The opinions of all but one of the

23 Circuits bear that -- bear that --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there a conflict on the

25 Circuits on that point? I don't know.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KISE: Your Honor, one Circuit -- ten of

2 the Circuits go in the direction that we advocate, and

3 Abela, the Sixth Circuit case that is cited, I

4 believe, by the Petitioner --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

6 MR. KISE: -- moves in the other direction.

7 And it is only recently that they have done that.

8 If the Court has no further questions, thank

9 you.

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.

11 Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, we'll hear now from

12 you.

13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER

14 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

15 IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT

16 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice,

17 and may it please the Court:

18 There is nothing in either the habeas rules

19 or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that deprives

20 the District Court of its authority sua sponte to

21 recognize the untimeliness of a habeas petition. To

22 the contrary, to the extent the rules speak to the

23 issue at all, they confirm that in light of the

24 significant social cost of Federal review of State

25 Court convictions, the Federal Courts have a unique

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 responsibility to weed out unmeritorious claims and to

2 enforce the limitations on habeas review.

3 Rule 4 imposes an obligation on the court to

4 dismiss unmeritorious petitions without even calling

5 for an answer by the State. Now, Rule 4 is not

6 applicable here, but the absence of an obligation to

7 note the deficiency sua sponte does not connote a

8 prohibition on acting sua sponte; rather, it suggests

9 that it lies in the court's discretion. That is

10 exactly how this Court addressed similar question in

11 Granberry, where it rejected the two extremes -- one,

12 recognizing the limitation as jurisdictional, that the

13 court was obligated to raise it sua sponte, but also

14 rejecting the opposite extreme, that the court was

15 prohibited to address an issue that had not been

16 preserved in the District Court.

17 JUSTICE BREYER: Why, though, would we have

18 a special rule in this respect for habeas cases? Same

19 question I've had throughout. Treat it like any other

20 civil case.

21 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It's not really a

22 special rule that we're advocating.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, if it's not a

24 special rule, then the answer to this is, just say,

25 "No, you don't have to raise it sua sponte. Moreover,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you cannot raise it sua sponte, except in exceptional

2 circumstances," cite the three cases that said that.

3 And, as far as you're suggesting it to people, you

4 could do it just as much as you do in any other civil

5 case, no special rule. If they want to move to amend,

6 fine, end of case, we did it in a paragraph.

7 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The relevant

8 analogy in the civil context is not to what a court

9 would do with a statute of limitations defense in the

10 civil context, it is to what would the court do with

11 respect to an affirmative defense that, like the

12 habeas limitations, implicates broader social

13 interests?

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the same with strike

15 suits. You know, there are a lot of class-action

16 strike suits and so forth that at least one group of

17 people think are terrible and the other group think

18 are great. So, you say, "Well, we're going to have a

19 special thing here for amendments in strike suits.

20 Have a special amendment for some" -- you know, why

21 proliferate law?

22 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the Court

23 recognized -- Arizona v. California is an example of

24 the broader social interests that are implicated by

25 the affirmative defense of res judicata. And the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Court noted, in Arizona versus California, that it

2 would be appropriate for the court to raise that

3 defense sua sponte. And, of course, Plaut versus

4 Spendthrift Farm says the same thing.

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not generally. Statute

6 of limitations, like res judicata, they are 8(c)

7 affirmative defenses, and preclusion doctrine is for

8 the party to waive or not, just like the statute of

9 limitations. I don't think there's any rule that says

10 a judge in the run-of-the-mine case acts properly by

11 interjecting preclusion into a case where no party has

12 raised it.

13 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, our point is

14 that it is a matter for the court's discretion. And

15 there may well be circumstances where it would be an

16 abuse of discretion to interject a timeliness

17 objection. For example, if the case had gone on for

18 years, and a trial had been held, as Your Honor

19 suggested in the question earlier, that might well be

20 an abuse of discretion, but it would not -- for

21 example, take the case where the District Court had

22 dismissed, at the outset, on the merits, and it went

23 up to the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals

24 said, "You know, that merits issue is a very difficult

25 one. And, in fact, we think we might have to remand

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 for an evidentiary hearing on that issue. But, you

2 know, this case was untimely filed. We can dispose of

3 it on that basis. And we can save all of those

4 judicial and party resources by addressing that issue

5 now." We think that would be an appropriate exercise

6 of the court's discretion.

7 Here, as Your Honor noted earlier, this was

8 the first thing that happened in the District Court

9 after the filing of the petition, the answer, and the

10 reply. There was no waste of judicial resources by

11 the fact that it was raised sua sponte by the court in

12 the first thing that the court did after that

13 briefing. There was no prejudice to the Petitioner,

14 because it was omitted from the State's responsive

15 pleading. There is -- as the Court said in Granberry,

16 the failure to plead it perhaps waives the District --

17 the State's opportunity to insist on the defense. The

18 State, because it said, in its answer here,

19 erroneously, that the petition was timely filed, or if

20 it had said nothing, would have waived its opportunity

21 to stand on, and insist on, that defense. But it is

22 not an absolute forfeiture. It does not bar the party

23 from suggesting at a later time, "We would like to

24 amend," or, in this case, the court to note it sua

25 sponte.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 The court did, here, of course, give the

2 Petitioner every opportunity --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. From what you

4 just said, I take it that means that even when the

5 State is unwilling to change its mind and says, "No,

6 we would still prefer not to assert the defense," you

7 would allow the court to impose it.

8 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: We believe that the

9 court is not absolutely limited by the defenses --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: The answer --

11 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- asserted by --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- is yes.

13 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes. Yes. The

14 court is not absolutely limited by the affirmative

15 defenses asserted by the State. For -- and that is

16 perhaps most easily seen with respect to affirmative

17 defenses such as failure to exhaust, nonretroactivity.

18 If the court was going to have to assess a brand-new

19 constitutional claim that the habeas petitioner --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But with respect to

21 some --

22 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- was asserting --

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- of those, of

24 course, AEDPA specifically promulgates new rules about

25 when they're waived, and not. And they -- Congress

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 hasn't done that with respect to the statute of

2 limitations.

3 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. And

4 obviously, as the State suggested, if the State didn't

5 want to stand on the statute of limitations defense

6 because, for example, it was particularly messy, there

7 was going to be a lot of litigation about equitable

8 tolling, it would in inappropriate for the court to

9 insist on litigating that issue. But if, for example,

10 the State said, "Well, you know, if we didn't stand on

11 this defense, instead this Petitioner would go back to

12 the State Court, and the State's Courts are going to

13 be very hospitable to this claim. We think you're

14 more likely to deny relief, so we'd rather have it

15 litigated here," it would inappropriate for the State

16 to try to force the Federal Court to litigate that

17 issue instead of the State Court. These are all fact-

18 specific, case-specific considerations. And that's

19 what the Court did in Granberry. It remanded --

20 after setting aside both extreme positions, it

21 remanded to the Court of Appeals for a case-specific

22 application of discretion.

23 As to the question of whether the Eleventh

24 Circuit here believed that there was an absolute

25 obligation, I think that it's relevant to note that,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 although there was one point at which it said, "The

2 court was obligated to enforce the statute of

3 limitations" -- and, of course, that's true if the

4 State has preserved the defense -- there were three

5 other points in the Court of Appeals opinion where it

6 used discretionary or nonmandatory language. For

7 example, at petition appendix 4(a), the court said

8 that the District Court "may dismiss." At the

9 petition appendix 5(a), it said that the State's

10 failure to raise "does not bar" the court from acting

11 sua sponte. Again, at petition appendix 6(a), the

12 State's concession, quote, "does not compromise the

13 authority of the District Court." All of those are

14 phrased in more permissive language --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, of course,

16 "may" is -- "may" is embraced within "must." If you

17 "must," you "may."

18 [Laughter.]

19 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, perhaps the -

20 - perhaps the even most clear indication of what the

21 Court of Appeals viewed this is its citation to

22 Jackson as an application of Jackson. And in Jackson

23 there is no question, because Jackson said, quote,

24 "The District Court possessed the discretion to raise

25 sua sponte." And the -- and the magistrate judge, as

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the State's counsel, mentioned -- in footnote 1 of its

2 opinion, cites that same standard and makes clear that

3 it's raising this at a -- as a matter of its

4 discretion. So, remand for the exercise of discretion

5 would be -- serve no purpose in this case.

6 If there are no further questions --

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.

8 Mr. Busby, you have 4 minutes remaining.

9 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. BRETT BUSBY

10 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

11 MR. BUSBY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

12 I'd like to begin by addressing the "must"

13 versus "may" issue that Counsel discussed. For the

14 reasons I mentioned, I think the better reading of the

15 Eleventh Circuit's opinion is that there was an

16 obligation, and that the most clear indication of that

17 is its distinction of Esslinger, which expressly

18 applied a Granberry-type analysis. But, even if the

19 Court believes that the Eleventh Circuit was only

20 saying "may," and that the District Court was only

21 saying "may," and recognized the that it had

22 discretion -- and there is a footnote in the

23 magistrate's opinion that cites to Jackson that says,

24 "We have discretion" -- I would submit that if you

25 read Jackson, it's a standardless discretion. There

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 are no factors anywhere in Jackson of the type that

2 this Court discussed in Granberry. It -- and there's

3 no indication that the -- that the magistrate judge

4 considered any of those factors. There's no

5 indication that the Eleventh Circuit considered any of

6 those factors. And it's certainly an abuse of

7 discretion for a court to apply the wrong legal

8 standard or fail to consider the relevant factors that

9 channel that discretion.

10 And so, we -- our position is that, because

11 the factors under Rule 15 and the other factors in our

12 brief were not applied, that a remand, at a minimum,

13 is appropriate in this case.

14 Also, I'd like to speak to Granberry and

15 Caspari. Again, those involve exhaustion and

16 nonretroactivity. And I submit that it's not correct

17 to characterize those two doctrines as affirmative

18 defenses; rather, the way that Congress codified them

19 is on -- as substantive limits on relief, unlike

20 "limitations," which it just said "period of

21 limitations," which the commonly accepted meaning is

22 an "affirmative defense." And so, that makes those

23 very different from an affirmative defense, in terms

24 of sua sponte consideration.

25 Also, both "exhaustion" and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

56
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 "nonretroactivity" are unique to habeas. They're not

2 mentioned anywhere in Rules 8 and 12. Whereas,

3 "limitations," of course, is mentioned explicitly.

4 And so, our position is that Rule 8 and 12, not

5 necessarily always, but at least in all but

6 extraordinary cases, would prevent the judge from

7 raising this sua sponte.

8 Also, I would say that the rules that we

9 rely on don't deprive the court of sua sponte

10 authority, they channel that authority. Under Rule 4,

11 they can plead it, or the court can make a motion to

12 dismiss -- ask the -- order the State to make a motion

13 to dismiss based on limitations under Habeas Rule 4.

14 They can plead it in their answer, under Habeas Rule 5

15 and Civil Rules 8 and 12, or they can amend their

16 answer, under Civil Rule 15. That's the way the

17 drafters of the rules wanted them to do this. And

18 Lonchar and Carlisle say they cannot -- that a judge

19 cannot use his sua sponte power to circumvent the

20 requirements of those rules.

21 Finally, I'd like to mention that civil --

22 the statutes of limitations in civil cases also

23 implicate broader social interests. And some of them,

24 we've discussed in our brief. And, even more so,

25 because there are lots of protections in AEDPA cases

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

57
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that don't apply in civil cases. There are

2 presumptions of correctness and those sorts of things.

3 But courts in civil cases, nonetheless, say that

4 statutes of limitations can be waived. And the result

5 should be no different here.

6 Thank you.
