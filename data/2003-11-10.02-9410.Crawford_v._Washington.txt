1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:56 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument 4 next in No. 02-9410, Michael D. Crawford v. Washington. 5 Mr. Fisher. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. FISHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 9 may it please the Court: 10 The Confrontation Clause prohibited the 11 admission of the accomplice's custodial statement here for 12 two reasons: first, because its interlocking nature did 13 not establish its reliability under this Court's Roberts 14 jurisprudence; and second, and more fundamentally, because 15 the accomplice's custodial statement amounted to out-of16 court testimony that was never submitted to cross17 examination, in violation of the traditional understanding 18 of the right to confrontation. 19 QUESTION: When you say out-of-court testimony, 20 Mr. Fisher, what do you mean by the word testimony? 21 MR. FISHER: What I mean, Mr. Chief Justice, is 22 someone giving a statement out of court that is the 23 functional equivalent of what they would do in court, 24 which is to say they're giving the authorities a statement 25 that is describing an event in a way that they understand
3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 is going to be used in a criminal investigation. 2 QUESTION: So it may -- it -- the -- it applies 3 to the -- if it's made to the authorities but not to a 4 third person? 5 MR. FISHER: Ordinarily that's the -- that would 6 be the dividing line. 7 QUESTION: Why is that? 8 MR. FISHER: Well, because the Confrontation 9 Clause, to go back to the text and to start with the text, 10 talks about being a witness against somebody. And the -11 and the common understanding of that term is to give a 12 statement that you understand is going to be used in a 13 criminal investigation, and when you're giving a statement 14 to the authorities, here a custodial statement to the 15 police, that's a different situation than the ordinary, 16 everyday occurrence of speaking to a friend or a colleague 17 or something. 18 QUESTION: But your ultimate criterion is was it 19 made with the understanding that it would or probably be 20 used for prosecutorial purposes. 21 MR. FISHER: That's the way I read the -- the 22 term witness against in the Constitution. It's the 23 gateway to the Confrontation Clause. Yes, Justice Souter. 24 QUESTION: So in an auto accident, a private 25 investigator -- it's a serious accident. Private

1 investigators for both of the parties come out and make --

2 and make notes of what the witnesses said. Is -- is that

3 testimonial?

4 MR. FISHER: The private --

5 QUESTION: It's a later criminal proceeding and

6 it's --

7 MR. FISHER: Well, I mean, I -- I think that

8 that's the kind of a statement that ordinarily is not

9 going to be testimonial. You know, an auto accident -- I

10 take it you're -- you're talking about an auto accident in

11 terms of a criminal case. But --

12 QUESTION: Well, it's -- it's an auto accident

13 and insurance investigators are all over the scene when it

14 later turns into a criminal case.

15 MR. FISHER: I mean, that's the kind of a

16 situation that there could be a difficult question in

17 something like that, but I think that is likely not to be

18 testimonial.

19 QUESTION: Well, it's --

20 QUESTION: What about if the -- what about a

21 police officer who does the same thing?

22

MR. FISHER:

I think the police officer

23 certainly tips the balance and certainly when somebody is

24 talking to a police officer, that's the kind of a

25 statement they understand is going to be used in court.

1 QUESTION: Well, if -- if we're going to change, 2 as you suggest in your brief, to using this term 3 testimonial, it certainly does not bring any great 4 certainty, does it, if you say something tips the balance 5 one way or another? Obviously, you're going to get a lot 6 of close cases. 7 MR. FISHER: Well, I understand, Mr. Chief 8 Justice, there are going to be some close cases out on the 9 margins, and I acknowledge that. But what the testimonial 10 approach does is it covers the core cases, the ones that 11 the Confrontation Clause has always been concerned with. 12 And really, it's not so much a new test. What 13 -- what the testimonial approach does is really sum up 14 what this Court itself did in interpreting the common law 15 and bringing that under the umbrella of the Sixth 16 Amendment starting in Kirby and Mattox, the Court's 17 earliest decisions on the Confrontation Clause, really all 18 the way up through Douglas in the 1960's where actually in 19 that very opinion the Court uses the term to describe a 20 custodial confession -- the Court uses the term the 21 equivalent of testimony. And so that's the kind of a 22 situation we're talking about to -23 QUESTION: When you -24 QUESTION: But you -- you -- your proposal would 25 effect a significant change in doctrine, I guess, from the
6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Roberts case, and I think even under your proposal certain 2 testimonial statements would be admissible against the 3 defendant, for instance, where the defendant has 4 contributed to making the witness unavailable and so 5 forth. 6 MR. FISHER: Well, the -7 QUESTION: I mean, you -- you would still have 8 some testimonial statements in there. 9 Tell me which of our cases, since the Roberts 10 decision, would have come out differently under your 11 proposed approach. 12 MR. FISHER: I don't think, Your Honor, any 13 cases since Roberts. 14 QUESTION: No case. 15 MR. FISHER: Nor any case before Roberts. 16 QUESTION: Then why change? 17 MR. FISHER: Because the lower courts aren't 18 getting it right, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and I think 19 that the problem is, is that the Roberts approach sets up 20 a framework that is both unworkable in practice and is 21 leading to consistently anomalous results. And I think 22 it's -23 QUESTION: Idaho would have -- v. Wright would 24 have come out the same way because the doctor who took the 25 statements of the child was acting at the request of the
7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 police? 2 MR. FISHER: That's how I understand the facts 3 of the case, Justice Kennedy. The victim was -- was in 4 police custody at the time of the examination, and it was 5 in coordination with the police. So, yes, Idaho v. 6 Wright, as well as all this Court's other cases, would 7 come out. 8 But it's important, you know, to go back to the 9 question and say, you know, why change from Roberts if 10 we've gotten to the right places in -- in our cases. And 11 the answer is, you know, certainly this Court may never 12 have to change from Roberts, but simply understanding the 13 way that Roberts is working in the lower courts I believe 14 should cause this -- cause the Court great concern. 15 The -16 QUESTION: But isn't -- isn't that our -- our 17 function in part? We occasionally take cases from lower 18 courts to straighten out misconceptions. Presumably 19 that's how these things get worked out. 20 MR. FISHER: That's correct, Justice O'Connor, 21 but, you know, I would submit that you're going to have to 22 practically fill your docket with Confrontation Clause 23 cases doing error correction in order to come out correct 24 in all these cases. 25 QUESTION: Well, we've -- but we've had Roberts
8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 for 23 years, and we certainly haven't filled our docket 2 with Confrontation Clause cases. 3 MR. FISHER: Well, that's right. And that's -4 and -- and what's happened, because you haven't done that, 5 is the lower courts are reaching some very, very bad 6 results. I was responding to Justice O'Connor's question 7 about why change from Roberts if we're getting to the 8 right solution, and the reason is because the way that the 9 test is framed, it just simply is unworkable in the lower 10 courts. As we cited in our brief, there are -- we 11 gathered 20 factors that lower courts are using for 12 indicia of reliability. We could have listed 40 or 50. 13 The United States is asking you, as well as the 14 State, to stick with this -- stick with this reliability 15 approach for all of its faults. And you know, the -- the 16 ironic thing with that kind of a -- of -- of a position is 17 the more testimonial the statement is, the more reliable 18 it is, and in turn -19 QUESTION: Before you give the reasons, I -- I 20 want to go back to what you said. You say the test should 21 be functional equivalent of testimony. The functional 22 equivalent is a little vague, and the law professors in 23 their amicus brief suggest that the question should be, 24 would a reasonable person in the position of declarant 25 anticipate that the statement would likely be used for
9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 evidentiary purposes? Would you accept that as a -- a -2 would you adopt that phrasing of the question, or do you 3 have a different phrasing, or do you think if we did 4 follow your approach, the opinion should simply say 5 functional equivalent? 6 MR. FISHER: Well, first of all, Justice Breyer, 7 you don't have to get too far into that in this case 8 because, of course -9 QUESTION: No, no. But I mean it's true that -10 I realize that, but -- but perhaps we could do a little 11 bit better than say just testimonial. If -- if we 12 accepted your approach -13 MR. FISHER: I think -14 QUESTION: -- so I'm -- I'm -- I want your 15 opinion on that. I mean, there -- we have several briefs 16 here. We have variations on the theme, and I want to know 17 which variation you think is the best or which is the 18 worst. I read you one of them. 19 MR. FISHER: I think I agree with the starting 20 point of the functional equivalent of testimony. And then 21 I think that the law professors' test, the reasonable 22 expectation, is a good test, and I would -- I would 23 embellish that by saying that I think that what we have is 24 99 cases out of 100 that's going to be the situation that 25 I -- I believe the Chief Justice brought up, which is the
10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 -- somebody speaking to the authorities in the course of

2 the investigation of a crime, somebody giving a statement

3 to the authorities or directing one to them.

4 QUESTION: Would there be anything that fit in

5 your category where the person to whom the statement is

6 made is not an officer, either a police officer or

7 prosecutor?

8 MR. FISHER: I think there may be, and the

9 reason -- I think there may be a -- a rare, rare case,

10 Justice Ginsburg, in a scenario -- you know, come up with

11 hypotheticals. One possible scenario might be somebody

12 giving a statement to their friend and directing them to

13 tell the police.

So, you know, simply using an

14 intermediary where we know the statement is going to the

15 police, but --

16 QUESTION: Why -- why should it depend on the

17 intent of the declarant? I -- why is that -- why does

18 that make the declarant a witness within the meaning of

19 the Confrontation Clause? I mean, suppose -- suppose the

20 police get -- get the statement from the declarant

21 surreptitiously. They do not let -- let him know that

22 they are, in fact, the police. That -- that would

23 disqualify it under the law professors' test from being

24 testimony?

25 MR. FISHER: Well, in that --

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Because he would not know that this 2 was going to be used in court. 3 MR. FISHER: Well, I mean, I think that's a 4 situation -- you know, and this is where the definitional 5 problem gets difficult. I mean, because the other part of 6 the Confrontation Clause is a limitation on State power, 7 and it says -- you know, going all the way Blackstone, 8 it's a limitation on the State molding statements that 9 it's going to use later in a criminal investigation. So 10 if that kind of a situation were present where somebody is 11 molding somebody's statement, I think that might be 12 something the Confrontation Clause is concerned with as 13 well. 14 And that goes back to Justice Ginsburg's 15 question to say that, yes, there may be, you know, 16 difficult cases -- difficult hypothetical out in the 17 margin, but what we have here is a test that covers what 18 are the time-and-again cases that are coming before this 19 Court and coming before the lower courts. 20 QUESTION: Well, but -21 QUESTION: Are you -- just -- just with the 22 dialogue with Justice Scalia, because I'm interested in 23 the same problem, is it the intent of the speaker or the 24 intent of the person taking the statement that would be -25 be more relevant in your view?
12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FISHER: Well, certainly I -- I -- you know, 2 you don't have to decide that question in this case, but I 3 think that if either one of them -4 QUESTION: Well, of course -- of course, we do. 5 I mean, I -- I really object to saying, you know, just -6 just don't worry about it. We'll worry about it later. I 7 mean, if there are real problems that come up later, I'm 8 not going to buy your -- your retreat from Roberts. 9 MR. FISHER: I see, Your Honor. I think that 10 proper -- the proper test would be if -- if one of the two 11 people is so -- you know, is doing something with the 12 purpose of understanding it's going to be used in a 13 criminal case, then we have a testimonial situation. I 14 think you -- this Court could say that, but it -- you have 15 to look back -16 QUESTION: You mean either the speaker or the 17 person taking the statement. Is that what you're saying? 18 I don't understand your response. 19 MR. FISHER: I think certainly the speaker and I 20 think there may be situations -- and this is -- this is 21 something the Court can deal with about when this -- about 22 when the -- when the governmental officer is the only one 23 and -- and is under such a circumstance that the 24 governmental officer is molding the statement in such a 25 way and molding what somebody is going to say --
13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Well, you know, the concern we ought 2 to have with your approach is we're going to get into some 3 very tricky questions if we go your route in deciding 4 what's testimonial, and why buy a pig in a poke, in 5 effect? 6 MR. FISHER: Well, the first reason is because, 7 as I said, if you have difficult cases out on the margin, 8 I submit to the Court the Constitution could tolerate 9 that. 10 QUESTION: Yes, but I think the professors there 11 are thinking that isn't difficult. I think they're 12 thinking it is the question of whether a reasonable person 13 in the declarant's position would think it was likely that 14 this was going to be used in testimony because if you look 15 to the position of the police, you will suddenly find that 16 tape recorded informant testimony of an ongoing 17 conspiracy, while they're planning to rob the bank, and 18 suddenly is kept out of court. And there is no reason. 19 We wouldn't keep it out of court today. It would be -20 come in under the co-conspirator rule. So I think that 21 they wrote these words in this brief thinking about it, 22 and now if we're suddenly going to go and -- and open this 23 all up to a whole bunch of other things, I'd be a little 24 nervous about it too. 25 MR. FISHER: No, I'm sorry, Mr. -- Justice
14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Breyer. I may have misunderstood partially the suggestion 2 -- the hypothetical that I was getting. I think you're 3 correct that the traditional kind of co-conspirator 4 statements under that kind of a situation would come in 5 under either approach. What I understood the hypothetical 6 to be was a situation where somebody, after a conspiracy 7 is done, is doing -8 QUESTION: It's your view that a co-conspirator 9 statement is not testimonial then? 10 MR. FISHER: I think that's the ordinary course 11 of events. Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 12 QUESTION: Well, why is that if it meets the 13 test of a statement made to the police? 14 MR. FISHER: Well, if there's an undercover 15 officer present, it meets -- it meets the -- the -- you 16 know, the test of a statement made to the police. But 17 then I think this is where the law professors have it 18 right, and this is where I'm agreeing with Justice Breyer. 19 QUESTION: Not -- you're right. It's not 20 automatically. Under the rule today, if it's a co21 conspirator statement, right in the police station, 22 because it's an ongoing coverup conspiracy, I guess it 23 would come in. But I think under the new rule, if in fact 24 everybody in that room knows that it is likely to be used 25 as a substitute for testimonial use at trial, it would not
15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 come in. I think that's the point of the change. 2 MR. FISHER: I think that's correct. 3 QUESTION: And -- and -4 QUESTION: Well, how -- how about a wire tap? 5 You've got a wire tap going, and you hear co-conspirators 6 on -- on the other end of the wire. Is that testimonial 7 or not? 8 MR. FISHER: I think that's the traditional kind 9 of co-conspirator statement that is not covered by the 10 testimonial approach. And -- and I think -11 QUESTION: And under your approach it would come 12 in without difficulty. It would not be testimonial. Is 13 that what you're saying? 14 MR. FISHER: Without difficulty as to the 15 Confrontation Clause, yes, Justice O'Connor. 16 And I think it's important when we look at these 17 hypotheticals to compare what we have on the other side 18 when you look at the Roberts approach. Under the Roberts 19 approach, no matter how much -- you know, if somebody 20 gives an out-of-court affidavit, if somebody speaks ex 21 parte to a grand jury, even if a witness takes the stand 22 in the middle of a criminal trial -- in -- in a criminal 23 trial and puts blame directly on the defendant, and then, 24 for example, were to die or suddenly go missing, under 25 Roberts you have the situation where the trial judge
16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 doesn't strike the testimony, doesn't disallow it, but 2 looks to its reliability. 3 And the odd thing -- and this is what I was 4 getting to earlier. Compared to what the State and the 5 Solicitor General are proposing to you today, the odd 6 thing is the more testimonial it is, the more it comes 7 under the core concern of the Confrontation Clause that 8 started in Raleigh's trial and has moved all the way 9 forward -- the more testimonial it is, the more likely 10 it's pass -- it is to pass the Roberts test. 11 QUESTION: Well, let's look at this very case 12 and tell me whether the result is any different at the end 13 of the day under Roberts versus your test. 14 MR. FISHER: I think the answer is absolutely 15 not, Justice O'Connor. Under this Court's Wright opinion 16 -- you know, the rationale for the lower court was 17 interlocking confessions. Under this Court's Roberts -18 I'm sorry. Under this Court's opinion in Wright, it is 19 only the inherent indicia of reliability surrounding a 20 statement not other evidence at trial that a judge can 21 look to. So -22 QUESTION: And therefore? I mean, relate it to 23 this case, if you would. Tell me whether the result would 24 differ under your proposal and under Roberts in this very 25 case. Why don't you focus on the statement and tell us
17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 why it would or would not be different?

2 MR. FISHER: It doesn't matter in this case,

3 Justice O'Connor, for two reasons.

4 First of all, because under Wright, you cannot

5 look to the defendant's confession in order to assess the

6 reliability of Sylvia's statement, and that's what the

7 Washington Supreme Court did.

8 The second reason is even if you could look to

9 that -- to the substantive evidence at trial, several

10 other indicia showed that the statement here was

11 unreliable. The -- the witness was drunk. She said she'd

12 been in shock during the events.

She gave two

13 inconsistent statements within a 4-hour span. She was in

14 police custody after being told that it depended what she

15 told the officers as to whether or not she'd be allow to

16 leave. So there are several, several reasons to believe

17 that the statement here --

18 QUESTION: Is it --

19 MR. FISHER: -- you know, is excludable under

20 both tests.

21 QUESTION: Why is it excludable under your test?

22

MR. FISHER:

Well, under the testimonial

23 approach, Mr. Chief Justice?

24 QUESTION: Yes.

25 MR. FISHER: For the simple reason that she was

18
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 in custody giving a statement, giving a confession or a -2 or a custodial examination to police officers knowing it 3 was going to be used in the criminal investigation. 4 That's the traditional -- it is -- is the most common -5 it is the core concern of the Confrontation Clause. 6 QUESTION: How -7 MR. FISHER: It brings us all the way back to 8 Raleigh's trial. 9 QUESTION: How about a statement like in Mancusi 10 or one of those cases where the witness is given prior 11 recorded testimony? There's been an opportunity to cross12 examine. The witness is presently dead or unavailable. 13 Does that come in under your system? 14 MR. FISHER: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. Mancusi 15 comes out exactly the same way, and here's why. And this 16 shows why my test -- why the testimonial approach is 17 actually quite narrow. All the testimonial approach says 18 is the witness has to have had a chance to cross-examine 19 the witness. 20 QUESTION: The defendant. 21 MR. FISHER: If, when it comes time for trial -22 I'm sorry? 23 QUESTION: The defendant. 24 MR. FISHER: I'm sorry. The defendant has to 25 have had a chance to cross-examine the witness. If trial
19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 rolls around and the witness is unavailable, through no 2 fault of the parties, and there's been adequate cross3 examination, as in Mancusi and actually as in Roberts 4 itself -- and -- and I actually -5 QUESTION: Cross-examination by the defendant, 6 not by somebody else. 7 MR. FISHER: Right. The statement needs to be 8 given in the defendant's presence with the defendant 9 himself having the opportunity to cross-examine. 10 QUESTION: Would -- would your approach overrule 11 Inadi? 12 MR. FISHER: No, I don't believe it does. 13 QUESTION: So you wouldn't have to say -- show 14 that a particular declarant was unavailable. 15 MR. FISHER: You would have to show that a 16 particular declarant is unavailable -17 QUESTION: Well, then -18 MR. FISHER: -- if it were a testimonial 19 statement. What -- what -20 QUESTION: Well, then how about a spontaneous 21 declaration? 22 MR. FISHER: Well, that's the kind of a thing 23 that's traditional hearsay. It's outside of the scope of 24 the phrase witness against. It's outside of the scope of 25 the testimonial approach.
20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: So it would come in under your 2 system? 3 MR. FISHER: An excited utterance comes out the 4 same way under -5 QUESTION: Without -- without having to show 6 unavailability. 7 MR. FISHER: Right. It's just purely a hearsay 8 question, Justice -- Chief Justice Rehnquist. 9 QUESTION: Because you say that's outside of the 10 Confrontation Clause entirely, not lumping all of hearsay. 11 I thought your whole point is we don't want to lump all of 12 hearsay under the Confrontation Clause. 13 MR. FISHER: That's exactly right. I'm sorry, 14 Justice -15 QUESTION: But there's one aspect of this case 16 that before your time is up I hope you can enlighten me 17 on. The reason that this witness is unavailable is that 18 the defendant has exercised his right to prevent his wife 19 from testifying against him. Is that correct? 20 MR. FISHER: It's -- it's close, Justice 21 Ginsburg. Washington law renders as a default rule that a 22 spouse is unavailable to testify against another spouse. 23 Mr. Crawford here declined to waive that privilege. 24 QUESTION: All right. But because he could have 25 not asserted that or not waived it, why doesn't that carry

1 over also? Why doesn't her immunity -- his control of 2 whether she can speak -- why doesn't that control as well 3 the use of the substitute for her testimony? If -- if 4 there is such a privilege, why doesn't it cover both her 5 actual testimony in court and the substitute for that 6 testimony? 7 MR. FISHER: Well, I mean, I think you're asking 8 me as a Federal issue. As -- you know, as a State law 9 issue, Washington State law has decided that the second -10 that the out-of-court statement can come in. As a 11 Federal -12 QUESTION: I just don't understand the logic of 13 it. 14 MR. FISHER: As a -- well, the reason -- you 15 don't understand the logic of the State law rule? 16 QUESTION: The State -- yes, to say that he can 17 keep her off the stand, but he can't prevent a substitute 18 for -- for that statement -19 MR. FISHER: I agree, Justice Ginsburg. It is 20 -- it is a somewhat odd State law rule. There's a -21 there's a case called State v. Burden that the Washington 22 Supreme Court held that the marital privilege applies just 23 to the -- just to actually facing your spouse on the stand 24 in the course of a trial because it -- you know, it helps 25 your spouse avoid the possibility of perjury and things

1 like that. And it said it doesn't apply to out-of-court 2 statements. I think you could make a very strong argument 3 that it ought to apply to both, but as a State law matter, 4 the Washington Supreme Court has said only in-court 5 testimony. 6 Unless the Court has any further questions, I'll 7 reserve the remainder of my time. 8 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Fisher. 9 Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you. 10 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN 11 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE 12 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 13 please the Court: 14 If the Court reaches the second question 15 presented in this case, the United States submits that the 16 Confrontation Clause should be properly construed to be 17 limited to testimonial statements and their functional 18 equivalent, but it should not be an absolute bar against 19 the admissibility of that kind of statement. 20 QUESTION: Well, you kind of want it both ways. 21 It's kind of an odd position. Has the Government taken a 22 different position on the testimonial aspect in the past? 23 MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice O'Connor. We took the 24 same position with respect to the limitation of the clause 25 to testimonial statements in White v. Illinois, and this
23
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Court rejected that submission by a 7 to 2 vote. We 2 renewed it in this case in light of the Court's grant of 3 certiorari on the second question presented in which the 4 petitioner's position is that this Court has too broadly 5 construed the Confrontation Clause, but within its 6 compass, it should be given an absolute prohibition. 7 QUESTION: I don't -- I don't understand. You 8 -- you say it's limited to testimonial statements. The -9 the clause is limited to testimonial statements. However, 10 it is not absolute. 11 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct. 12 QUESTION: Are there any other provisions that 13 are in the Bill of Rights that are not absolute and can be 14 overcome by proof that the -- that the overall purpose of 15 the truth-serving function is -- is achieved? For 16 example, the right to jury trial. Do -- do we approach 17 that by saying, oh, in a really complicated case where a 18 jury would impede rather than facilitate the finding of 19 truth like, you know, a Sherman Act case, yes, it says 20 there's -- you're -- you're entitled to trial by jury, but 21 the whole purpose of it is to achieve truth, and where 22 that purpose wouldn't be served, let's forget about the 23 jury? We don't say that, do we? 24 MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Scalia, but -25 QUESTION: Then why do we say it about the
24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Confrontation Clause? And that -- that's essentially the 2 Government's argument, that -3 MR. DREEBEN: The Court has said it about the 4 Confrontation Clause -5 QUESTION: I know it has. 6 MR. DREEBEN: -- in a variety of contexts. 7 QUESTION: And -- and the issue here is whether 8 we -- we should retreat from those statements. 9 MR. DREEBEN: Well, starting from the overall 10 structure of the Sixth Amendment, the Court has construed 11 many of the rights in the Sixth Amendment not to be 12 absolute in certain contexts. The jury trial right does 13 not extend to all criminal prosecutions as the language of 14 the Constitution would provide. It does not -- the right 15 to counsel does not extend to every criminal case in which 16 a -- arguably the text would require. The -- the 17 Compulsory Process Clause has been held -18 QUESTION: That -- that's just a matter of 19 limiting the scope. The right to counsel. Do you have 20 the right to counsel for, you know, at -- at every moment 21 during -- during recesses in the trial and so forth? 22 That's -- that's just a matter of the scope of it, not a 23 matter of saying, yes, this is within the scope. This is 24 testimonial, but we nonetheless will not follow the 25 command of -- of the constitutional provision that the
25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 accused is entitled to be confronted with the witnesses 2 against him. 3 MR. DREEBEN: What this Court has said about the 4 Confrontation Clause is that it incorporated a preexisting 5 common law right that had common law exceptions with it, 6 and those common law exceptions were capable of growing 7 and being developed along the lines of analogous 8 principles. 9 QUESTION: Growing and being developed so that 10 the -- the guarantee of confrontation is just a guarantee 11 that in the future we'll -- we'll leave it there if we 12 think it should be there. 13 MR. DREEBEN: It's not an absolute guarantee. 14 What helps to, I think, explain that is to look at what 15 confrontation involves. It involves having a witness 16 who's under oath, who is subject to cross-examination, 17 who's demeanor can be observed by the jury, and who is 18 brought face to face with the accused. Now, this Court 19 has held in a number of cases that all or some of those 20 components of confrontation may be dispensed with when, in 21 the necessities of the case and in order to obtain witness 22 -- witnesses who will be able to testify at the trial, it 23 is required to do so. 24 For example, in the instance of former 25 testimony, you have oath, cross -- and cross-examination,
26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 and you have at one point the defendant face to face with 2 the witness, but you do not have the important 3 confrontation right of the jury having the opportunity to 4 observe the demeanor of the witness. And the Court held 5 that that is required because the necessities of the case 6 require overcoming what would otherwise be a confrontation 7 right. 8 Similarly in Maryland v. Craig, the Court held 9 that the literal face-to-face right to confront the 10 witness may be overcome by the necessities of the case. 11 QUESTION: But then maybe your position is not 12 different from -- from theirs in this respect, if you take 13 the law professors'. If you say, as you do in your brief, 14 that it allows testimonial evidence in where the 15 circumstances are such that they serve the same underlying 16 purpose as the Confrontation Clause, then all you're 17 saying is the same thing that they say here. Will the 18 accused have had an adequate opportunity to confront the 19 witness? In other words, like a -- a prior trial. Is 20 that all you're saying? Because if that's so -21 MR. DREEBEN: No. It's definitely not what 22 we're saying, Justice Breyer. 23 QUESTION: No, it certainly isn't. You're -24 you're defining the underlying purpose much more broadly 25 than the law professors.

And if there 4 are other indicia -5 QUESTION: Oh, achieve the truth. 6 QUESTION: Yes. 7 MR. DREEBEN: To serve the truth-seeking mission 8 of the -9 QUESTION: Sir Walter Raleigh -- if they came in 10 -- Sir Walter Raleigh -- in fact, it is shown that all the 11 -- the statements made out of court against Sir Walter 12 Raleigh were made in front of 12 bishops, and at that time 13 that was a very, very good security that this was 14 completely true. Twelve bishops who saw the thing and -15 and they, you know, go -- they say, absolutely accurate. 16 In -- in your opinion, that would then come in in Sir 17 Walter Raleigh's own case. 18 MR. DREEBEN: I doubt seriously that -- that Sir 19 Walter Raleigh's case would come out differently under our 20 approach. What we are talking about -21 QUESTION: In other words, Sir Walter Raleigh -22 it came out that they did introduce this thing. So you're 23 saying if we take -- if we take -24 MR. DREEBEN: The witnesses were available, 25 Justice Breyer, in Walter Raleigh's case. And our
28

1 position on the availability of witnesses is that when

2 they are available, they should be brought in.

3 QUESTION: You would overrule Inadi then?

4 MR. DREEBEN: Oh, definitely not, Mr. Chief

5 Justice. Our view of Inadi is that the statements of co-

6 conspirators made to each other out of court in connection

7 with the -- with the conspiracy are almost invariably non-

8 testimonial statements. There may be a few rare instances

9 in which the co-conspirators are continuing the conspiracy

10 and speaking to law enforcement, and in that context, in

11 the unlikely event that the United States submitted that

12 those statements were coming in for the truth of the

13 matter asserted and not because they were false, then

14 perhaps there would be some issue about our approach. But

15 in the vast majority of cases --

16 QUESTION: Well, what about in this case?

17 There's a co-conspirator's statement.

18 MR. DREEBEN: There was no suggestion in the

19 lower courts that these two individuals were attempting to

20 further the conspiracy or that there was a conspiracy

21 going on at the time of the statements.

22 QUESTION: Well, I was going to say there was no

23 conspiracy found, was there?

That's -- these -- these

The -- the Confrontation 6 Clause -7 QUESTION: -- type of confession or something. 8 MR. DREEBEN: The hearsay basis was statement 9 against penal interests.

DREEBEN: We do not endorse that position, 17 Justice Stevens. 18 QUESTION: What is your position as to what 19 should have happened with this statement? 20 MR.

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct.

2 QUESTION: -- this theory.

3 MR. DREEBEN: Under Roberts, as explicated in

4 Idaho v. Wright, corroborating evidence that serves to

5 show the reliability of a particular statement is not an

6 acceptable means of vindicating its admission under the

7 Confrontation Clause.

8 I can think of only two possible reasons why the

9 confession of the defendant when it interlocks with the

10 statement made out of court might be treated differently,

11 and neither of those arguments seems to me to be valid.

12 One would be if, as a factual matter, the

13 defendant's own statements showed that the out-of-court

14 statement was reliable to a degree not found with any

15 other corroborating evidence, and I don't think that

16 that's --

17 QUESTION: Well, couldn't he be impeached with

18 his out-of-court statement?

19 MR. DREEBEN: He certainly could and was

20 impeached with his out-of-court statements.

21 And this brings me to the second reason, Chief

22 Justice Rehnquist.

The defendant can attack the

23 reliability of his own out-of-court confession. He's not

24 bound by some notion of estoppel that because he said it,

25 therefore it must be true. And the record in this case

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 reflects that Michael Crawford attempted to present a 2 self-defense at trial that was substantially more robust 3 than the statements that he made at the time. And under 4 Crane v. Kentucky, this Court has held that a defendant 5 can attack the reliability of his own statements. So even 6 if the statements did directly interlock, in the sense 7 that the defendant's statements matched the out-of-court 8 declarant's statements, that would not render them per se 9 reliable for confrontation purposes. 10 QUESTION: But they didn't match, and that's the 11 oddest thing. On the key thing, the most important to the 12 defendant, he suggested that the -- the person he 13 assaulted had reached for something before the assault. 14 And her testimony -- or her statement is that it was only 15 after the defendant assaulted the victim that the victim 16 reached in -- in his pocket. I don't see how those could 17 be said to interlock. They seem to clash with each other 18 on the key point in the case. 19 MR. DREEBEN: And -- and the State made that 20 point in its rebuttal argument. So there -- there is 21 certainly ample basis for saying that under existing law 22 the statements do not come in. 23 The question for the Court is should the Court 24 revisit its Ohio v. Roberts jurisprudence because of the 25 concerns about whether Ohio v. Roberts was
32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 constitutionally accurate. 2 QUESTION: Well, concerns by whom? 3 MR. DREEBEN: Concerns that I think are -- are 4 raised by reading the Confrontation Clause as an original 5 matter before this Court's jurisprudence made all hearsay 6 subject to the Confrontation Clause. 7 Now, we do not submit that there is a practical 8 need for the Court to revise its jurisprudence. The 9 United States has not encountered a significantly 10 difficult burden in admitting evidence under the hearsay 11 rules under the Roberts approach as -- as it has now been 12 articulated. And we also acknowledge that the Court would 13 have to develop a jurisprudence to decide what testimonial 14 statements means, if the Court adopts the testimonial 15 approach. 16 What we do submit is that the way in which the 17 word witness against is used in the Sixth Amendment, 18 particularly when read in light of the way the word 19 witness is used in the Fifth Amendment and also in the 20 Sixth Amendment's Compulsory Process Clause, that the word 21 witness was meant to refer to people who were giving 22 evidence for purposes of a case, not to people who simply 23 happen to observe facts in the world and made statements 24 about them and that are now being used as hearsay in a 25 criminal trial.
33
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Do you think that developing a 2 jurisprudence to decide what constitutes testimonial 3 statements is any more difficult than developing a 4 jurisprudence to determine what are sufficient indicia of 5 reliability to overcome the text of the Confrontation 6 Clause? 7 MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Scalia. I think they 8 both involve certain challenges. 9 What exists today is a body of law that has 10 examined the indicia of reliability question, and with 11 respect to certain statements in the testimonial category, 12 such as victim statements to the police in a condition 13 that might be likened to an excited utterance or sometimes 14 in statements in aid of medical diagnosis or treatment, 15 and also true statements against penal interests such as 16 guilty pleas by a defendant that does not implicate the 17 defendant on trial but simply acknowledges criminal 18 conduct, the lower courts have concluded that those 19 statements do have sufficient indicia of reliability to be 20 admitted. 21 And our concern is that if this Court were to 22 adopt the testimonial approach, that it not do so in a way 23 that would foreclose lower courts from taking advantage of 24 evidence that is reliable, unavailable from another 25 source, important in criminal prosecutions and well-

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 grounded in the theory of the Confrontation Clause as a 2 vehicle for achieving truth in criminal trials. 3 QUESTION: Why unavailable from another source? 4 Let's say you have this -- this self-incriminating 5 confession, but the person is available. You could put 6 him on the stand to test whether that confession that he 7 made was true or false. Why -- where do you -- where do 8 you pull this requirement that -- that he be unavailable 9 from? If indeed it doesn't violate the Confrontation 10 Clause because it's sufficiently reliable, why does he 11 have to be unavailable? 12 MR. DREEBEN: Our position is that with respect 13 to testimonial statements, the preference is to get live, 14 in-court testimony with all of the benefits that the 15 Confrontation Clause envisioned for testimony. 16 But sometimes a defendant who pleads guilty is 17 still awaiting sentencing, and as this Court held in 18 Mitchell v. United States, the defendant still has a Fifth 19 Amendment privilege and can refuse to testify on grounds 20 of privilege. Other defendants who plead guilty in their 21 own cases will sometimes refuse to testify even on pain of 22 contempt, and at that point the choice for the judicial 23 system is either admitting that's -- that evidence in the 24 criminal trial or excluding it altogether and risking a 25 manifest failure of justice because there isn't the

DREEBEN: Thank you -8 QUESTION: Mr. Sherman, we'll hear from you. 9 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN C. SHERMAN 10 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 11 MR. SHERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please 12 the Court: 13 The State of Washington is asking the Court to 14 -- I guess, to simply say -- excuse me -- retain the 15 reliability framework of Ohio v. Roberts. Excuse me. 16 The -- the primary part of Ohio v. Roberts 17 that's important to the State is the reliability factor, 18 and the reason that -- that that's important is because 19 essentially Ohio v. Roberts recognizes that there are 20 other rights and interests at stake in a criminal trial 21 other than the defendant's confrontation rights. For 22 example, it recognizes that society as a whole has an 23 interest in seeing that criminal activity is properly 24 addressed. 25 QUESTION: We could have written it that way, I
36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 suppose. I mean, the Confrontation Clause instead of 2 saying in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall 3 enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses 4 against him, we could have added, comma, unless there are 5 other considerations. 6 MR. SHERMAN: That's correct -7 QUESTION: It doesn't say that. It says in all 8 criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right 9 to be confronted with the witnesses against him. 10 MR. SHERMAN: That -- that's correct, Your 11 Honor. And when I -12 QUESTION: Where -- I mean, I don't understand 13 where we derive this permissibility of not allowing him to 14 confront the witnesses against him so long as we come to 15 the judgment that the evidence is inherently reliable. 16 MR. SHERMAN: Well, Your Honor, I guess to 17 answer that question properly, I -- I'll speak to what I 18 at least read and heard actually petitioner had in one of 19 the amici briefs concerning the -- the history surrounding 20 the Confrontation Clause and how we got to have the right 21 to confrontation. And essentially what I -- I gleaned 22 from that is there, at a point in time, was not a right to 23 confrontation, and over the course of centuries, the right 24 developed. But it appears to me that it developed based 25 -- developed based upon really what public policy was,
37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that the -- the society would not tolerate the inequities 2 of the systems that were in place that were denying 3 confrontation and felt that it was fair that this concept 4 of confrontation take place. 5 So when the -- the Framers of the Constitution 6 put that right into the Bill of Rights, it was based upon, 7 in my view, their perception that the public policy that 8 their society at that time wanted to recognize and make 9 everyone know that they're retaining that to be their 10 right. 11 I don't think, though, that it would rationally 12 follow that -- that they intended that everything that 13 they said be written in stone and -14 QUESTION: No. That may be -15 QUESTION: It could be amended. It could be 16 amended. I mean, you know, there's an amendment provision 17 in the Constitution, but -- but until it's amended, it -18 it does seem to say that in all criminal prosecutions, you 19 -- you have the right to be confronted. 20 MR. SHERMAN: And I would agree. And in fact, I 21 -- I think one of the points that -- that I -- I want to 22 make is that a literal interpretation of the Confrontation 23 Clause bars the petitioner's proposal and the proposal of 24 amici and the proposal of the State to maintain the 25 Roberts framework.

1 QUESTION: Why?

2

MR. SHERMAN:

If you take literally the

3 Confrontation Clause, I believe that it --

4

QUESTION:

It says witnesses, confront

5 witnesses. A witness is a person who testifies and I

6 don't see any literal problem there.

7 MR. SHERMAN: I -- I believe that everyone that

8 comes and sits on the witness stand and says anything that

9 is going to be used --

10 QUESTION: A typical case that -- where it

11 should come in, but I guess under their proposal it would,

12 and under the status quo it probably wouldn't. We have a

13 case of drug conspiracy. During the conspiracy, well

14 before anybody is caught, they discover, through whatever

15 means, that there's a cup on the mantel, a pewter cup,

16 that's filled with drugs. Who does it belong to? Does it

17 belong to the defendant? We have a witness who overheard

18 the defendant's wife shout out from the kitchen, Dink,

19 have you got your pewter cup? It's on the mantel. All

20 right? Does that come in or not come in? Whether it does

21 or not, it's not a Confrontation Clause question.

22 You say that we should make that into a

23 constitutional question.

We should have all the

24 constitutional courts going into it or not?

25 MR. SHERMAN: Well, I -- I respectfully disagree

39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 with Your Honor -2 QUESTION: Why? 3 MR. SHERMAN: -- that it's not a Confrontation 4 Clause question. 5 QUESTION: All right. You say it is. In other 6 words, every time that a -- that a -- a trial in any one 7 of 50 million trials in the United States decides to admit 8 some hearsay, in principle, you go into habeas and the 9 Federal judge has to decide whether that hearsay is or is 10 not, quote, reliable, end quote, for purposes of the 11 Confrontation Clause. That's the present system. 12 So you're the prosecuting attorney. Correct? 13 MR. SHERMAN: Correct. 14 QUESTION: You have experience in this area. 15 Tell me if this is right. 16 What I would expect to have happen is that all 17 these habeas courts, when they get real hearsay, nothing 18 to do with the trial, you know, real hearsay like I just 19 talked to you about, they'll find it reliable if the -- if 20 the -- if the State court admitted it. 21 Then, however, they get to this kind of a case 22 where the police were actually there writing out 23 affidavits which they're going to introduce, and there 24 what they'll say is, no, it's not reliable. 25 So in order to make the Roberts system work,
40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 what will happen is you have to have two ideas of 2 reliability. Now, has that been a problem or am I just 3 making that up? Because what they're saying is the 4 Roberts thing makes no sense. If you take it seriously, 5 it keeps out stuff that should come in and it lets in 6 stuff that should stay out. And if you don't take it 7 seriously, which is what must have happened, it just 8 produces a mess. 9 MR. SHERMAN: To address the first part of your 10 question, Your Honor, I believe what I was -- was 11 attempting to say was that the Confrontation Clause, 12 strictly interpreted, it is going to not let any hearsay 13 of any kind in. Yes, that is my position. 14 QUESTION: You mean the -- the only kind of 15 evidence that can become -- come in at a criminal trial is 16 from a witness who's physically present in the courtroom. 17 MR. SHERMAN: I believe that that would be a 18 strict interpretation of the Confrontation Clause, Your 19 Honor. 20 To answer the second part of -- of your 21 question -22 QUESTION: From your own experience. I'm quite 23 interested actually, if -- if you followed what I was 24 saying. 25 MR. SHERMAN: Well, actually --

SHERMAN: I do and -- and I can say from my 4 experience, I have had very few problems arise with 5 Confrontation Clause principles under the Roberts 6 framework. And -- and as a matter of fact, in 12 years of 7 practice, this is the first time I've ever seen -- I've 8 seen an interlocking confession come up. 9 But I think that the reason that -10 QUESTION: Do you think this was interlocking? 11 MR. SHERMAN: I do, Your Honor. 12 QUESTION: Well, they certainly differed on a 13 key element. I'm not sure it would come in under Roberts. 14 MR. SHERMAN: And, Your Honor, I -- I believe 15 that the court of appeals also, at least the majority of 16 that court, believed that there was a difference between 17 what the -- Mr. and Mrs. Crawford were saying, but the -18 our supreme court looked more closely at the statements 19 and observed that in fact they were saying the same thing. 20 QUESTION: Wasn't the whole point of admitting 21 it that -- that she had, in effect, said there -- there 22 was no weapon, the victim was not taking a weapon out, and 23 that was on the basis of her statement the prosecutor made 24 exactly that argument? Wasn't that why it came in? 25 MR. SHERMAN: No, not specifically that -- that

1 she said that he wasn't taking one out because clearly she 2 didn't say that. And if in fact that was the -3 QUESTION: Well, her description did not include 4 one. And -- and wasn't that the basis of the prosecutor's 5 argument, that this wasn't self-defense? 6 MR. SHERMAN: In part, and -- and -- but his 7 description did not include a -- a weapon either. Both of 8 their descriptions -9 QUESTION: No, but the implication of his 10 description was that he reasonably thought something was 11 coming out and he then in one of his statements said, you 12 know, it was him or me. And the reason her statement was 13 admitted was that it was not congruent with that, that 14 there was no indication in her statement that a -- that a 15 -- a weapon was being withdrawn. So at the -- I -- isn't 16 -- isn't that the reason that the statement, for the 17 purpose it was admitted, was not interlocking? 18 MR. SHERMAN: I believe that that was that 19 prosecutor's interpretation of -- of that evidence, and 20 that is in fact what he argued at trial. I think he was 21 incorrect. I think that if you look at the statement, it 22 very -- Sylvia Crawford very clearly says that -- that the 23 victim appeared that he was reaching for something in his 24 pocket. 25 QUESTION: After the assault.

1 MR. SHERMAN: No, Your Honor, I respectfully -2 QUESTION: Why don't we look at this since the 3 testimony is there? I read it that way. 4 MR. SHERMAN: And -- and, Your Honor, as I 5 indicated, so did apparently my deputy prosecutor and so 6 did our court of appeals. Our -- our supreme court read 7 it as -- as I am. 8 QUESTION: But one of the worrisome things about 9 treating all these things as just hearsay reliability. I 10 don't understand how this testimony comes in. When the 11 woman testified -- when the woman said in her statement I 12 was drunk, I closed my eyes, how could that possibly be 13 reliable? 14 MR. SHERMAN: Well, she did say those things, 15 but she also said things that indicated that that was not 16 quite -- quite correct. She also said, well, I saw 17 certain things going. I saw Michael stab the victim. I 18 saw the victim doing these -19 QUESTION: But she said at that time she had 20 been drinking and she -- that happened before. I just 21 don't understand this reliability test that allows 22 something to come in that doesn't coincide with what the 23 defendant himself said, and that the declarant is saying, 24 oh, I was scared. I closed my eyes. 25 MR. SHERMAN: Well, and -- and I understand Your

1 Honor's question and -- and position. One of the things

2 that obviously you can't get out of the flat piece of

3 paper is -- is what her true condition was, and that is a

4 problem. But I don't recall her saying specifically that

5 she was drunk at the -- at the time, merely that she had

6 been drinking and she indicated that Michael had been

7 drinking as well. But I don't know that --

8 QUESTION: She did say that she shut her eyes

9 and didn't really watch. Those were her words. I shut my

10 eyes and didn't really watch. How could such testimony be

11 reliable?

12 MR. SHERMAN: Well, because she at the same --

13 in the same breath was able to accurately describe the

14 same events that Michael had described in his statement.

15 QUESTION: But that's unreliable. I mean, you

16 have a witness who says two -- two opposite things. I saw

17 this, and on the other hand, I shut my eyes.

18 MR. SHERMAN: And -- and I understand Your

19 Honor's position on that. I -- I just respectfully

20 disagree. I don't think that those factors by themselves

21 necessarily render it to be unreliable.

22 QUESTION: May I ask --

23

QUESTION:

But suppose we said it was

24 unreliable. Let's suppose we held that. And in this case

25 it goes out. All right. Now, so we've had a pretty tough

45
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 standard in your view of what counts as reliable and not. 2 It's been a pretty tough standard. It has to be really 3 reliable. 4 MR. SHERMAN: Right. 5 QUESTION: Okay. Now, what's going to happen 6 when the courts, the Federal courts or the State courts, 7 apply that tough standard of reliability to hearsay 8 statements that have to do with the -- involved in the 9 commissions of the crime itself? In other words, not -10 not when they're in the police station giving confessions, 11 but like the example I gave you with the cup. 12 Now, suppose we apply the tough standard of 13 reliability to those. Would that make a difference? 14 Would they then start to be kept out because they violate 15 the Confrontation Clause? 16 MR. SHERMAN: I think at -- at a certain point 17 the tougher you make the standards for hearsay to come in, 18 the fewer pieces of hearsay that are going to come in. I 19 don't think that that's necessary in this case because 20 what -- if -- if we're simply talking about interlocking 21 confessions and whether such a thing exists and if they -22 as the question presents, if there will ever be such a 23 thing as a confession that sufficiently interlocks so that 24 it will be sufficiently reliable to be admitted or not, 25 the Court could simply say there's just never going to be
46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 a situation that comes before us where they will interlock 2 sufficiently and -- and be admittable -- admitted. 3 QUESTION: Mr. Sherman, on this question of 4 interlock, I know we've referred to interlock in Bruton 5 cases where they've got joint trials of the defendants and 6 that sort of thing. What is the strongest case you have 7 for the proposition that absent a joint trial, the 8 interlocking nature of a confession -- or a statement is 9 critical? 10 MR. SHERMAN: I think it would be this case 11 that's before the Court today, Your Honor. 12 QUESTION: I see. So none of our precedents 13 support that proposition. 14 MR. SHERMAN: I think actually the only time 15 this Court has addressed the interlock theory on its 16 merits -17 QUESTION: Is in the Bruton-type -18 MR. SHERMAN: -- was in Lee v. Illinois when it 19 was simply the issue of the interlocking confession and 20 there wasn't any side issues of co-defendants in the same 21 trial or any of those other issues. 22 QUESTION: But -- but we have said in other 23 cases that the reliability, which -- which Roberts insists 24 upon, has to be established from the statement itself and 25 not from other statements. Right?

QUESTION:

Which would seem to exclude

2 interlock --

3 QUESTION: Interlocking confessions. That's the

4 problem I have with it. We -- we haven't had such a case,

5 but the standard that we expressed in Roberts would seem

6 to exclude interlocking confessions as establishing

7 reliability.

8 MR. SHERMAN: And if Roberts were the only case

9 that -- that the Court were to look at, that I think would

10 -- I would agree that would be the case. But in Lee v.

11 Illinois, I think this Court very clearly accepted --

12 interpreted the concept of interlocking confessions, and

13 thereafter in Cruz v. New York. But in Lee, the Court

14 actually set forth a test to be used -- at least in

15 Earnest v. New Mexico, the Court called it a test -- but a

16 test to be used in determining when an interlocking

17 confession can be admitted. Now, that followed Roberts.

18 QUESTION: But wasn't that a joint trial? I

19 can't remember for sure.

20 MR. SHERMAN: I don't believe that Lee was a

21 joint trial, Your Honor. In fact, I think in -- Lee was a

22 case in which the Court -- this Court determined that the

23 confessions did not sufficiently interlock to make them

24 reliable to be admitted, and also there was --

25

QUESTION:

I thought Lee involved co-

48
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 defendants. 2 MR. SHERMAN: Well, I -- I believe there -- I 3 don't -- I don't recall there being co-defendants at 4 trial, and I may be mistaken about that. My recollection 5 is that the -- the two holdings of Lee were, one, that -6 that they couldn't be corroborated by other evidence; and 7 two, that the confessions simply weren't sufficiently 8 interlocking. And I may be mistaken. I just -- I'm not 9 recalling there being co-defendants tried at the same time 10 in that particular case. 11 But my point being that Lee, of course, came 12 after Roberts and, in my mind, established a third way of 13 -- third form of -- of determining reliability that was 14 separate from what was in Roberts. Roberts had your 15 indicia of reliability and your well-founded hearsay 16 exception, and then in Lee it's my perception that this 17 Court formed a third test, that being the interlocking 18 confession rule test, and that -19 QUESTION: But the bottom line was that it -20 that that test was not met in the case, that there wasn't 21 a sufficient interlock. 22 MR. SHERMAN: That -- that wasn't met in the Lee 23 case, and that was the decision of the court of appeals in 24 this case. And it was our supreme court that reversed 25 that and said, no, we believe that they did sufficiently
49
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 interlock. 2 QUESTION: I thought that what we said in Lee 3 was simply that assuming that an interlocking confession 4 exception exists, this didn't meet it. I -- I don't know 5 that we -- that -- that we spoke as though there was such 6 an exception. We just said assuming it does exist, the 7 facts here don't -- don't meet it. Isn't that what the 8 case held? 9 MR. SHERMAN: I think perhaps. I -- I know that 10 in the very least the Washington State Supreme Court 11 interpreted it to be a test, and I know that in Earnest v. 12 New Mexico, this Court called it a test for determining 13 when interlocking confessions can come in. So taking it 14 from both of those cases, the Washington Supreme Court in 15 the very least determined that it was a test, and in fact, 16 in I believe it's State v. Rice said we adopt this new 17 test from -- from Lee v. Illinois as to interlocking 18 confessions. 19 QUESTION: I thought actually that there were 20 five members of the Court in Lee v. Illinois to say that 21 confessions of a co-defendant are presumptively unreliable 22 for purposes of Roberts. 23 MR. SHERMAN: Correct, Your Honor. 24 QUESTION: And that even if there was a so25 called interlocking confession exception, it wasn't met in
50
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that case. 2 MR. SHERMAN: And -- and I can understand that 3 interpretation. I -- it just -- I'm -- I'm certain that 4 it's not the interpretation that the Washington State 5 Supreme Court made, and in fact, most courts -6 QUESTION: Well, maybe they better re-read it. 7 (Laughter.) 8 MR. SHERMAN: That's entirely possible, Your 9 Honor, and I'm certain that after today, they will -- they 10 will do so. 11 (Laughter.) 12 MR. SHERMAN: The point -- but the point being 13 that if there is not an interlocking confession rule, then 14 there is not. If this Court says we -- there will never 15 be a situation where one co-defendant's confession, 16 regardless of how identical it is to the defendant's, will 17 ever be reliable enough, then so be it. Then we'll have 18 that test. It will be straightforward and can be applied 19 accordingly. 20 That, in all candor, is the lesser of the 21 State's concerns in this coming -- in this case coming 22 before this Court today, the primary concern of the State 23 actually being that this Court retain the reliability 24 standard of -- of State -- of Ohio v. Roberts for a 25 variety of reasons that relate essentially to, as I
51
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 indicated earlier, this underlying recognition that there 2 are simply other interests at stake other than the 3 defendant's that really need to be addressed. 4 QUESTION: Why should the Court retain it when 5 this very case gives us an example of how arbitrary that 6 determination is made whether it's reliable? When a court 7 can call something -- a witness -- a declarant in the 8 shape this one was and say that's reliable, shouldn't that 9 make us worry about using that test? 10 MR. SHERMAN: Well, I have to say that I don't 11 think this Court or any court can make a test that is not 12 going to have some problems, and in fact, both the 13 petitioner and the learned professors admit that their 14 system have -- has problems too. Any system is going to 15 have problems. The bugs are going to have to be worked 16 out. It'll take years of -- of cases, and the -- and the 17 reality is -- and I, of course, mean no disrespect to any 18 judge -- anytime you get -- you have a judge making a 19 discretionary decision, on the same set of facts there's 20 simply going to be some judges that will make exactly 21 opposite decisions based upon the same set of facts. 22 That's just human nature. 23 In this case -- and the point that I'm trying to 24 make is that Ohio v. Roberts is a known quantity, it's a 25 known entity. I haven't experienced any problems with its
52
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 application personally or in cases that have been 2 addressed at my office since I've been there. A new 3 system that is proposed by the petitioner and the amici 4 simply fails to take into consideration, as this Court did 5 in Ohio v. Roberts, that there are other rights and other 6 interests that are involved in a criminal case. It 7 doesn't address problems concerning witnesses that become 8 unavailable through no fault of the State. Yet, why 9 should society suffer to have a criminal defendant 10 released simply because a witness has become unavailable? 11 And you know, you can't always prove a defendant 12 has made a witness unavailable. That is a really tough 13 standard. 14 There are similar other cases where particularly 15 young witnesses, who are perfectly capable of telling you 16 exactly what happened to them or what they've seen in a 17 nonconfrontational setting, but yet, because of either 18 fear or intimidation, they are simply unable to come into 19 court and testify in front of a bunch of strangers or in 20 -- probably in front of the very person who is alleged to 21 have victimized them. They're not going to be able to say 22 a thing. Yet, there needs to be some way to get what they 23 can say in front of a jury. I -- I think that any system 24 that prohibits that is just going to be contrary to the 25 interests of society in general and to the interests of
53
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the other parties that -- that are involved in the trial 2 other than the defendant. 3 And if there are no further questions, thank you 4 very much. 5 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Sherman. 6 Mr. Fisher, you have 3 minutes remaining. 7 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. FISHER: Thank you, Your Honor. 10 I think it's important to concentrate in 11 rebuttal on the State's suggestion and the Solicitor 12 General's suggestion to retain the reliability prong of 13 the Roberts framework. 14 The Solicitor General agrees with us that the 15 history of the -- that -- that you ought to be looking to 16 history here, and the history on this point is crystal 17 clear. From Rex v. -- Rex v. Paine in 1696, other English 18 cases before the Constitution, and then this Court's cases 19 after the Constitution was adopted, principally Kirby and 20 Mattox, and all the way through Douglas, the -- when the 21 situation arose that a witness was unavailable, the rule 22 was clear if the -- if -- if the statement was 23 testimonial, given to the authorities, it had to be 24 excluded. And it's not -- and the -- and the balance was 25 struck by the Framers not -- not just because of these
54
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 public policy considerations, but because of the Framers 2 were insisting upon an adversarial method of giving 3 testimony. And when the Framers decided, when that was 4 not present, that we were simply not prepared to -- to 5 admit the testimony. 6 And so what we have is we have a clear rule 7 until at least the 1970's that reliability doesn't matter. 8 And the only time reliability -- first was adopted by this 9 Court. The only time it became important was in Dutton v. 10 Evans when you had a non-testimonial statement, and then 11 in Roberts when this Court created a general framework 12 that it allowed reliability, all of a sudden, be into play 13 when we were stretching the Confrontation Clause in our 14 view too far. 15 But once you bring the Confrontation Clause back 16 to the proper scope, as we're asking you to do and the 17 Solicitor General is asking you to do, there's really no 18 reason anymore to -- to keep the reliability prong. The 19 reliability prong was -- was adopted by this Court to deal 20 with the problem of hearsay that was coming outside the 21 testimonial type setting. Once you -- once you read it -22 read that problem away, we're back to the original 23 understanding of the Confrontation Clause. 24 And the reason that you ought to stick with that 25 -- Justice Ginsburg I think put the nail on the head when
55
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 she said the reason we're here today is that you have a -2 you -- you have -- what you have now is a system where 3 trial judges can reach almost any conclusion they want. 4 That's shown in our briefs. The Solicitor General doesn't 5 even describe to you how reliability -- doesn't even 6 defend reliability findings in light of all the briefing 7 by -- by the petitioner and by amici. 8 And so I think that when you look at that, you 9 show that the very concern that gave rise to Raleigh trial 10 -- and I would say parenthetically that I believe Lord 11 Cobham was unavailable in the trial. That's what the 12 transcript says. And the very problem was that trial 13 judges could do these reliability determinations in place 14 of -- of a clear rule of when testimony could be given. 15 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Fisher. 17 The case is submitted. 18 (Whereupon, at 11:56 a.m., the case in the 19 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 20 21 22 23 24 25
