3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Case No. 155238, Nichols v.

5 United States.

6             Mr. Hansmeier.

7           ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL T. HANSMEIER

8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9             MR. HANSMEIER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10 it please the Court:

11             Until three weeks ago, a sex offender who

12 moved to a foreign country was not subject to any

13 Federal registration requirement in the United States

14 unless and until he returned to the United States.

15 Below, the Tenth Circuit nonetheless held that it is a

16 Federal crime for a sex offender who moves to a foreign

17 country to fail to  to report that move.  The Tenth

18 Circuit was wrong for three overarching reasons.  First,

19 SORNA's text does not include a requirement to

20 unregister.

21             Second, SORNA's statutory history reveals

22 that if Congress wanted to include a requirement to

23 unregister, it would have done so just as it did before

24 SORNA's enactment.  And finally, a requirement to

25 unregister is unnecessary because all 56 jurisdictions

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
4 1 require sex offenders to unregister.  Failure to do so 2 is a violation of the jurisdiction's law and not Federal 3 law. 4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That would be true of 5 Kansas law in this case.  It would have violated the 6 Kansas law.  Is that true? 7             MR. HANSMEIER:  He had an  he had a 8 requirement to tell Kansas of his departure, correct. 9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How does it work 10 normally?  Say a person under SORNA leaves Kansas and 11 goes to Illinois and registers in Illinois.  Is there 12 any obligation, one, for him to register or deregister 13 in Kansas, and does Illinois have an obligation to 14 notify Kansas? 15             MR. HANSMEIER:  Correct.  So what happens in 16 practice is that SORNA sets minimum Federal standards. 17 And those minimum Federal standards are supplemented by 18 the States, the additional, more stringent requirements. 19 One of those more stringent requirements is the 20 obligation to unregister, and, yes, Kansas has that 21 obligation. 22             So in your hypothetical, Justice Ginsburg, 23 that individual has to unregister in Kansas under State 24 law, and when he gets to Illinois, that's the Federal 25 requirement to tell Illinois  to register, to update
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the registration in Illinois because that's the

5

2 jurisdiction where he resides.  And in Illinois under

3 16921(b)(3) will tell  will tell Kansas of the  of

4 the move.

5             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And this is in addition

6 to the  the other venues.

7             MR. HANSMEIER:  If there are any, correct.

8             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So it would be both

9 Federal and a State requirement.  But in one case, it's

10 on the SORNA person and the other, it's the other State.

11             MR. HANSMEIER:  I think that's correct, yes.

12             JUSTICE ALITO:  Under 

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What sense does it

14 make if you have Federal law that says we're going to

15 add this  these  these sanctions when you violate

16 the  the State law?  And in the one case, if you don't

17 register, you're triggered and State law says, well,

18 you've got to unregister too.  But if you unregister 

19 if you don't unregister, that's not included under the

20 Federal law?  Why would  why would Congress draft a

21 law like that?

22             MR. HANSMEIER:  Well, I  I think they

23 would have done that because  and if you look at the

24 legislative history, I think this is somewhat clear.

25 What Congress was concerned about were missing sex

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
6 1 offenders not at initial registration but when  when 2 the sex offender crossed State lines.  So  so by  by 3 requiring registration when you get to the jurisdiction, 4 that  that was the aim because that's when offenders 5 were going missing. 6             Now, the  the departure jurisdiction would 7 be a relationship between  very much a relationship 8 between the State and its citizens.  And that  that's 9 played out if you think of a State sex offender who 10 could live in Kansas.  And if he were to have a Federal 11 requirement to unregister in Kansas, that's actually not 12 enforceable under SORNA because the travel has to come 13 after or before he's  he can't register. 14             So if Mr. Nichols were a State sex offender 15 and  he's only committed an offense when he leaves 16 Kansas.  And that doesn't  and that's a problem if 17 we're saying that there's a Federal requirement to 18 unregister in  in the departure jurisdiction.  Now, 19 that may work for Federal offenders, but I think the 20 idea is that there are Federalism concerns underlying 21 SORNA.  And those Federalism concerns come into play 22 when an individual crosses State lines, and that's the 23 minimum requirement in SORNA. 24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but there's no 25 problem to require him to register, but all of a sudden
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 there is a problem to require him to unregister?

7

2             MR. HANSMEIER:  Well, it's not a problem.

3 It's just SORNA left it to the States.

4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They left the

5 unregistering to the States but not the registering?

6             MR. HANSMEIER:  Not a  not the updating

7 the registration in a new State, correct.

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm curious.  You

9 responded to Justice Ginsburg that he did violate State

10 law.  Could the United States have asked for an

11 extradition based on the State law violation?  Is this a

12 permanent hole or did they just pick the wrong law to

13 seek extradition under?

14             MR. HANSMEIER:  Well, Justice Ginsburg's

15 example was interstate travel.

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no, no.  I'm saying,

17 they asked him to be 

18             MR. HANSMEIER:  But you're talking 

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   returned from 

20 where had he fled to?  Philippines.

21             MR. HANSMEIER:  Mr. Nichols moved 

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Under the SORNA

23 violation 

24             MR. HANSMEIER:  Correct.

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   could they have asked

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 for him to be returned under the State law violation?

8

2             MR. HANSMEIER:  There's actually a provision

3 in SORNA, I think it's 19  16917, which requires

4 Federal  the marshals, Federal officials to assist the

5 States in enforcing the registration requirement.

6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So is that a yes?

7             MR. HANSMEIER:  I think yes.

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So really what we're

9 talking about is that they asked for the extradition

10 under the wrong law.

11             MR. HANSMEIER:  I think that's exactly

12 right.  And  and Mr. Nichols was also on Federal

13 supervised release, so there was a connection there that

14  the connection to the Federal aspect of it was his 

15 was his supervision.

16             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did leave  did leaving

17 the country without notice violate the terms of his

18 supervised release?

19             MR. HANSMEIER:  It did.  And he was  his

20 supervised release was revoked.  He  he received a

21 tenmonth sentence for that.  And then they still

22 prosecuted him Federally, and he got another sixmonth

23 sentence.

24             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are you  it's mentioned

25 in one  one of the briefs  I don't have the

Alderson Reporting Company

1 reference to it 

Official

9

2             JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.

3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   at hand.  What would

4 happen if he decides he's  and this is all just within

5 the United States, no foreign travel  he decides that

6 he wants to move to the West Coast, so he checks out of

7 Kansas.  But he's not sure where he wants to live, so he

8 drives to Washington, Oregon, California, takes two

9 weeks.  What would the requirement for registration be

10 there?

11             MR. HANSMEIER:  Right.  Well, I think it

12 gets a little confusing with the interstate travel

13 because we don't really address it because there is a

14 jurisdiction.  There is an arrival jurisdiction.  I

15 think under our rule, what 16913(c) says is that you

16 don't unregister.  You  you register in the arrival

17 jurisdiction.  Now, there may be 

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the arrival

19 jurisdiction is not your residence yet.  He doesn't know

20 what it's going to be.  He's just there two days.  And

21 he's going to go two days, and he's going to look

22 around.

23             MR. HANSMEIER:  Well, I  I think SORNA

24 doesn't do a good job of this.  The definition of 

25 they define "resides" as the location of one's home or

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1 the location where one habitually lives.  And so I do 2 think that SORNA does not do a good job of this, but I'm 3 not sure that that wasn't unintended.  Because if you 4 think about the  the  the window, the 5 threebusinessday window  6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes. 7             MR. HANSMEIER:   that  that actually 8 creates a system where an individual is not on the 9 registry for a certain amount of time.  If you think of 10 a change of name, which you have to report, if you have 11 three business days to do that, there is going to be up 12 to five days where that registry is inaccurate, and 13 that's just the way it is. 14             So I think, although we might not want to 15 admit it or  but the  the reality is that SORNA 16 actually creates these gaps by allowing offenders some 17 period of time to register.  And I think Congress did 18 that because it knew the States could supplement SORNA. 19 These are just minimum standards. 20             JUSTICE ALITO:  You have a textual argument 21 that I  that I understand, but one of the arguments 22 you mentioned at the outset was that an examination of 23 the legislative history shows that Congress intended to 24 produce the sort of result that was produced here, and I 25 wonder if that's really a plausible argument.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1             If you're correct, then two things happen; 2 at least two things happen.  One, Kansas retains on its 3 record an inaccurate  inaccurate information about the 4 presence of a sex offender, which can have a lot of 5 adverse consequences for a lot of people.  I don't see 6 why Congress would have wanted that to remain. 7             And do you really think Congress was 8 unconcerned about the United States exporting pedophiles 9 to the Philippines or to other countries?  Do you think 10 that  that they were not concerned about not only the 11 human rights implications of that, but our relations 12 with other countries? 13             MR. HANSMEIER:  Well  well, I think if you 14 look at the legislative history, there  there's 15 nothing to indicate that  that SORNA in 2006 had 16 anything to do with international travel.  And I think 17 the new legislation is important in this regard, because 18 whether  I don't  I don't know that I said 19 "intended."  If I said that, I didn't mean it.  I think 20 the  the history of it shows more or less that in 21 1996, each State had a registration system.  One year 22 later, Congress required departure notification, 23 required unregistration.  By 2006, that had happened in 24 all the jurisdictions. 25             So I think what I mean by the "statutory
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 history" is that that's  that's an indication why

12

2 there was no unregistration requirement put in SORNA,

3 because it existed in all the jurisdictions.

4             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if I could then come

5 back to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical of someone like

6 your client who moves from Kansas to Illinois, what, in

7 the language of the statute, would prevent that person

8 from going to the registry office in Kansas before

9 departing and reporting there that he was moving to

10 Illinois and his new address in Illinois would be

11 whatever it would be?  Why does that not fit under this

12  under the language of the statute?  Or would you

13 agree that it does?

14             MR. HANSMEIER:  Well, I would agree that

15 there's nothing that prevents him from doing that, and I

16 would agree that he should do that under State law,

17 but 

18             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if you  if you agree

19 to that, then I don't see why  why there is a

20 difference between that situation and the situation

21 where the  the person leaves Kansas and goes to the

22 Philippines.

23             MR. HANSMEIER:  Well, what  but I don't

24 agree that it's a  it's sufficient or a Federal

25 requirement to do it before.  That  I think that's the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 distinction I would make 

13

2             JUSTICE ALITO:  Why would it not be 

3             MR. HANSMEIER:   it's not a requirement.

4             JUSTICE ALITO:  Why would it not be

5 sufficient under 42 U.S.C. 16913(c)?

6             MR. HANSMEIER:  Well, because that provision

7 is still going to require  and the government, I

8 think, agrees with this.  There is still a  the  the

9 requirement is to report in the arrival jurisdiction.

10             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it says, "shall not,

11 later than three business days after each change of

12 residence, appear in person in at least one jurisdiction

13 involved pursuant to subsection (a) and inform that

14 jurisdiction of the change of address."

15             So prior to leaving, he is within the period

16 of not later than what  than three business days after

17 the change of residence.  And at that time when he goes

18 to the registry office in Kansas, he is residing in

19 Kansas.  So he falls within subsection (a).

20             MR. HANSMEIER:  Well, this is on  the text

21 is on page 11A of the blue book.  I think  I think

22 what's  the blue brief.  I think what's important

23 is  is if you looked directly above subsection (c) to

24 subsection (e), I think this is what you're really

25 saying Congress did.  Subsection (b) sets forth two

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 subsections, the first of which begins with the word

14

2 "before."  The second of which begins with the phrase

3 "not later than three business days after."

4             So I think if Congress had meant to do

5 something structurally similar in subsection (c), it

6 would have done it, but it didn't.  Instead, it just did

7 "not later than three business days after."  And  and

8 I think the change is a trigger, and I think that's 

9 that's key, and it's similar to subsection (b)(2) where

10 the trigger is being sentenced.  And  and so that

11 event has to happen, that occurrence has to happen

12 before you report it.

13             And so in subsection (c), until the change

14 happens, you can't really report it and satisfy this

15 provision.

16             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But now, under current

17 law, under the 2016 change 

18             MR. HANSMEIER:  Right.

19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   is it  it's clear

20 that anyone under SORNA who leaves the country 

21             MR. HANSMEIER:  Right.

22             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   has to give notice 

23             MR. HANSMEIER:  Right.

24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   to the jurisdiction

25 from which he departs.

Alderson Reporting Company

1             MR. HANSMEIER:  Correct.  And the

15

2 statutory 

3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So they're talking about

4 only the people who were  were pre  pre2016 people.

5             MR. HANSMEIER:  We're talking about a very

6 small subset, I assume, unless the Federal government

7 were to go out and indict a bunch of people who have

8 traveled prior to February 8th for this.

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What bearing on your

10 argument does the last sentence at the bottom of 11(a),

11 the last sentence of C have?  That jurisdiction, in

12 other words, the jurisdiction where he registered, shall

13 immediately provide that information to all other

14 jurisdictions in which the defendant is required to

15 register.  Here, there were none.

16             MR. HANSMEIER:  Well, correct.  And  and

17 typically, there may not be.  But that  that language,

18 I think, captures the defendant  for instance, where

19 we come from, a lot of people live in Kansas and work in

20 Missouri.  That  that sentence would capture that

21 situation where there is a  or a  an  an

22 employment jurisdiction that's different than a

23 residence jurisdiction.  Then the employment

24 jurisdiction would notify the residence jurisdiction or

25 vice versa.

16 1             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My question was, does  2 does this have significant relevance to your argument 3 here? 4             MR. HANSMEIER:  Does it help? 5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes. 6             MR. HANSMEIER:  I  I don't think it  I 7 just think it's how it's  I don't know that it helps. 8 It's  9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There was a reference to 10 a form that everyone under SORNA signs that acknowledges 11 a requirement to register on commencement change, 12 termination of residence, and give 21 days notice before 13 traveling outside the United States. 14             Nichols signed such a form, did he not? 15             MR. HANSMEIER:  He did. 16             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And what you're saying is 17 that that form has no operative effect, the fact that he 18 didn't do what he  what he undertook to do in the form 19 is not a Federal offense. 20             MR. HANSMEIER:  Well, what I'm saying is 21 that that's a State form.  That's actually the State of 22 Kansas.  So SORNA is implemented by the States.  So each 23 State  there's not some Federal form for sex offenders 24 to sign.  There are no Federal registration offices. 25 There are no Federal officials who do these things.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
17 1 This is a local thing.  A lot of it is county sheriffs. 2 It would be a State form.  Every State would have a 3 different form. 4             So what you are referring to, those are 5 quotation summaries of Kansas law, and not Federal law, 6 because if you're in Kansas, you have to  you are 7 required to register, to update your registration as 8 required by Kansas law, which is much more indepth than 9 Federal law.  And so that's where that language comes 10 from. 11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's the same 12 register, that is  you said there's no separate 13 Federal entity.  So all these requirements in SORNA 14 would be satisfied by informing the State office.  Is 15 that  16             MR. HANSMEIER:  Well, I'm saying, in 17 practice, that's what has to happen.  There's no Federal 18 person you can tell.  You register with the State 19 people. 20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I find interesting the 21 new legislation.  As I see it, it's getting away from 22 where you reside or anything else.  It just says if 23 you're going to travel to a foreign place, you have to 24 tell the United States, correct? 25             MR. HANSMEIER:  Yes.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there anything in

18

2 that  in that law that requires the U.S. to tell the

3 State the person's left  that they've left?

4             MR. HANSMEIER:  I think there is a provision

5 for that.

6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I didn't  I didn't

7 have a complete chance to go through it.

8             MR. HANSMEIER:  I don't know that that

9 provision made its way into the  the government's

10 supplemental brief.

11             Yes.  I think at (4)(a), if I'm reading this

12 correctly, there's an implementation provision.

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the problem at issue

14 here has been completely resolved by new legislation?

15             MR. HANSMEIER:  Oh, I think that's

16 absolutely true.  I think if there  whether there was

17 a gap or not, whether it was intended or not, the bottom

18 line is that it's gone away.  And there  there's no

19 reason to take an atextual interpretation of 16913(c).

20             I  I do want to mention something this

21 Court said in Reynolds, because I think this Court is on

22 the same path as us.  Reynolds was the second SORNA case

23 that the Court heard.  And there was  there's a point

24 in Reynolds in which the Court is talking about the

25 defendant, and it says  it says that he was in prison,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
19 1 he was released, he registered in Missouri, but he moved 2 to Pennsylvania.  And it says "without updating his 3 Missouri information," and then this Court puts in 4 parentheses, "as Missouri law required and without 5 registering in Pennsylvania."  Then it goes on to talk 6 about how the failure to register in Pennsylvania is a 7 16139(c) offense.  That's our position.  And I think 8 this Court  you said it in Reynolds.  It had nothing 9 to do with the holding.  But I  I do think that's  10 that's in this Court's mind, at least. 11             And  and I do want to note that the 12 government's reading defining the supplemental 13 jurisdiction is one where the defendant appears as a 14 resident on the  on  on a registry creates a really 15 weird situation where Mr. Nichols, when he lived in the 16 Philippines, because he still appeared on the Kansas 17 registry, under SORNA, he still lives there.  He still 18 resides there.  And that's just not right under the 19 statute and the way SORNA defines "resides."  And it's 20 just not right as a matter of common sense.  You don't 21 reside in Kansas when you actually live in the 22 Philippines. 23             And with that, if there are no further 24 questions, thank you. 25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

2             ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

3                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4             MR. GANNON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

5 please the Court:

6             SORNA required Petitioner to register and to

7 keep his registration information current.  This is not

8 an unregistration requirement, but a requirement to keep

9 his registration current in the jurisdictions where he

10 was registered by timely giving notice of any change of

11 residence to at least one jurisdiction involved.

12             And we disagree with Petitioner.  We think

13 Kansas was a jurisdiction involved pursuant to

14 subsection (a) here, both because of the meaning of that

15 phrase, which is more capacious than just taking down

16 the phrase that appeared in subsection (a), and also

17 because it's reinforced by Section 16921(b)(3).

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it your position that

19 he was required to notify Kansas both that he was

20 terminating his residence and that he was moving to the

21 Philippines, or just that he was terminating his

22 residence?

23             MR. GANNON:  Here it's just that he's

24 terminating his residence.  He could have given

25 information about where he was going.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
21 1             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But he was not required 2 to? 3             MR. GANNON:  But that is  that is not what 4 he was being required to do here.  He was being required 5 to keep his registration information current by saying 6 where he will  where  where he is residing, and he 7 will  he is no longer going to be residing here. 8             The phrase that  9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I  I think your answer 10 was clear, but I didn't understand it. 11             Would it  in your view  12             MR. GANNON:  The  13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   would it have been 14 compliant with SORNA simply to say I am leaving Kansas, 15 period? 16             MR. GANNON:  That would have complied with 17 his obligation to keep his registration information 18 current with the jurisdiction involved, yes. 19             The  we do think that Section 16914(a)(3) 20 allows him to report where he resides or will reside, 21 and therefore, he can report future information, and 22 therefore, the guidelines, promulgated by the Attorney 23 General in 2008, says that normally when somebody's 24 moving from one jurisdiction to another jurisdiction, he 25 should tell Kansas, I am leaving Kansas and this is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 where I'm going next, so Kansas can give that other

22

2 jurisdiction warning.

3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the  the Philippines

4 is not a jurisdiction under the statute.

5             MR. GANNON:  That's correct.  And so what we

6 think is key here is that Kansas is still a jurisdiction

7 involved pursuant to subsection (a).  Congress didn't

8 say a jurisdiction described in subsection (a); it said

9 a jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a).

10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, all right.

11 How is that the case since subsection (a) refers to each

12 jurisdiction where the offender resides, is an employee

13 or a student?  When he's in the Philippines, there's no

14 such jurisdiction covered by SORNA where he resides, is

15 an employee, or is a student.

16             MR. GANNON:  That's correct, Mr. Chief

17 Justice, but we think that that's not the only thing

18 that is pulled in by the phrase, "jurisdiction involved

19 pursuant to subsection (a)."  He is required to register

20 while he's a registrant in Kansas.  He's required to

21 keep 

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But how is that 

23             MR. GANNON:  At 

24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where is under (a)

25 something that says it's the jurisdiction where you used

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to be required to register?

23

2             MR. GANNON:  It's  it's the part that says

3 he has to keep the registration information current.

4 And subsection (c) informs us what it means to keep the

5 registration 

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But where 

7             MR. GANNON:   information current.  That's

8 further down on the page.  This is page 7A of the

9 government's brief.

10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but he only

11 has to keep the registration current if there is a

12 jurisdiction where he  covered jurisdiction where he

13 resides, is an employee or is a student.

14             MR. GANNON:  Well.

15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Otherwise that

16 obligation is inoperative because there's no

17 registration place in the Philippines.

18             MR. GANNON:  Well, we  we disagree that

19 Kansas is not a  is not a jurisdiction involved.  But

20 even if it were not such a jurisdiction, subsection (c)

21 requires him to give notice to at least one

22 jurisdiction.  And as Justice Alito has already

23 explained 

24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well 

25             MR. GANNON:   it is also the case here

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that he could have complied with that by giving the

24

2 notice before he left Kansas 

3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, right.

4             MR. GANNON:   when he was in dispute 

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But he doesn't have

6 to comply with it until later than three business days

7 after there's a change.

8             MR. GANNON:  That's not 

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So he 

10             MR. GANNON:  He doesn't 

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Shall not later than

12 three business days after each change?  That's not true?

13             MR. GANNON:  It is true that he has to

14 comply with it not later than three business days.  He

15 doesn't have an option of just not doing it.  And so if

16 he can't comply with it on business day one or business

17 day two or business day three thereafter, then maybe he

18 should have complied with it by informing Kansas before

19 he left.

20             The 

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, maybe he

22 should have.  Maybe he should have.  But he may also

23 have thought, when it says at least one jurisdiction

24 involved pursuant to subsection (a), and subsection (a)

25 says where he resides, then maybe there's no

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 jurisdiction involved under 

25

2             MR. GANNON:  But 

3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   under the 

4             MR. GANNON:  It does say where he resides.

5 But it also says he has to keep the registration

6 information current there.  And we think that Section

7 16921 

8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Current where?

9             MR. GANNON:  In  in the jurisdictions

10 where he has been registered, where he is residing, and

11 

12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it is current.

13             MR. GANNON:   and 

14             JUSTICE KAGAN:  It is current at all the

15 time in which he resides there.

16             MR. GANNON:  That is true.  I  I certainly

17 take the point.  But we think that Congress is using a

18 more capacious phrase in subsection (c) when it says,

19 "jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a)."

20 Kansas is inescapably involved because he has been

21 registered there.  And we think that this is reinforced

22 by Section 16921(b)(3) 

23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, then, you're just

24 reading pursuant to subsection (a) out of the statute.

25             MR. GANNON:  No.  I'm reading it to mean

Alderson Reporting Company

1 something 

Official

26

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Excuse me, Mr. Gannon.

3             It tells you exactly what it means to be a

4 jurisdiction involved.  It means a jurisdiction involved

5 pursuant to a particular subsection which focuses only

6 on his current residence.  And all the time he was a

7 current resident of Kansas, the registry was accurate.

8             MR. GANNON:  I understand that, Justice

9 Kagan, but our view is that this is not the same as

10 saying a jurisdiction described in subsection (a).  It's

11 a more capacious word to say it's involved pursuant to

12 subsection (a).

13             We know that Kansas is involved here.  And

14 Section 16921(b)(3) makes it clear that Kansas continues

15 to be involved because that's the provision that says

16 that as soon as the new change in residence information

17 is conveyed to at least one jurisdiction, that

18 jurisdiction has to give it to every jurisdiction 

19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.

20             MR. GANNON:   from or to which the change

21 of residence occurs.  So 

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand  I

23 understand your argument about 16914(a)(3), but how

24 many  what's the  the penalty for  the maximum

25 penalty for violating this provision?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
27 1             MR. GANNON:  I  I believe it's ten years. 2 It's  3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah.  I think 4 it's  5             MR. GANNON:   for violating the Federal 6 provision. 7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   ten years. 8             So you think somebody is supposed to look at 9 this and say, should I register?  Obviously he doesn't 10 want to register or unregister, whatever it is.  And he 11 says, okay, it says "involved," but that's different 12 than described in.  And (a) says "jurisdiction where the 13 offender resides," and there's no place to register 14 where I currently resides.  And then he's supposed to 15 say, ah, but 16914(a)(3) says "resides or will reside." 16             MR. GANNON:  And 6  17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's an awful lot 18 to ask a  a layperson to parse at the penalty of ten 19 years for being wrong. 20             MR. GANNON:  Well, there's  21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  For a registration 22 violation. 23             MR. GANNON:  It's  it's also a State law 24 offense.  And he signed notices, as Justice Ginsburg 25 pointed out, explaining that he had an obligation to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 report the termination of his residence 

28

2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then why wasn't 

3             MR. GANNON:   to Kansas.

4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why wasn't the State

5 violation pursued?  So he's in the Philippines, and he's

6 extradited because on the government's reading of SORNA.

7 But he did commit an offense, it's conceded, under State

8 law.

9             MR. GANNON:  That's true, Justice Ginsburg,

10 and that's going to be true in virtually every single

11 case of Section 2250.

12             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why wasn't the

13 extradition sought under that which is clear and certain

14 instead of a  a provision where there has to be a

15 strained interpretation?

16             MR. GANNON:  Well, maybe we should have

17 sought that as well, but we did think we had a strong

18 Federal interest in this particular prosecution for

19 multiple reasons.  He was a Federal sex offender.  And

20 as the Court has already recognized, the United States

21 has a special interest in ensuring that Federal 

22             JUSTICE BREYER:  In your interpretation.

23 Let's look at this.  It's the word "involved."  And

24 you're saying it means ever involved; is that right?

25             MR. GANNON:  No.  It means involved at the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1  at the point in time during the three business days 2 where the change in residence has happened and needs to 3 be notified.  And so we  4             JUSTICE BREYER:  I see. 5             MR. GANNON:   do think that the 6 sentence  7             JUSTICE BREYER:  In other words, it doesn't 8 mean "ever involved," and it doesn't mean "now 9 involved."  It means involved during the three business 10 days where dadadadadadadada. 11             MR. GANNON:  It  it means  12             JUSTICE BREYER:  And a person is supposed to 13 understand that. 14             MR. GANNON:  It  15             JUSTICE BREYER:  In fact, you're supposed to 16 read that into the silence. 17             MR. GANNON:  It means  18             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, that's, to me, a 19 little farfetched, would you say? 20             MR. GANNON:  No.  I don't think it's 21 farfetched because I think that it means it's involved 22  it's a jurisdiction involved in the change. 23             JUSTICE BREYER:  It's a jurisdiction  24             MR.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. GANNON:  No.  It's involved in the

30

2 change in residence because 

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  Ah.

4             MR. GANNON:   we know he's changing from

5 Kansas to somewhere else.  And so Kansas is inescapably

6 involved 

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  I see.  And 

8             MR. GANNON:   in the exchange of

9 information.

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  I'm trying to

11 understand it.  It is a jurisdiction that is involved in

12 a special way.  It is a jurisdiction that used to be a

13 residence, and it is no longer a residence.  And that

14 creates an involvement even after they're no longer a

15 residence.

16             You know, the more I explain it, the less I

17 understand it.

18             (Laughter.)

19             JUSTICE BREYER:  That may be my fault,

20 but 

21             MR. GANNON:  Well, perhaps it's mine as

22 well.  But I think that it's involved because he is

23 still registered there as a resident.  And we know that

24 the fundamental purpose of this law, in order to have a

25 sex offender registry, is to provide an accurate listing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 of where sex offenders reside 

31

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm firmly for purposes,

3 but this one is a  a little tough, because as I read

4 it, literally, at all, I don't  I don't get an

5 interpretation  and you could do the same thing.

6 You're supposed to  and you seem to be saying that.

7 Look, you said you're supposed  they're supposed to

8 keep the registration current.  Now, maybe there's a

9 requirement somewhere that says when you're thinking of

10 leaving, before you leave, you have to go tell the

11 people before you leave of where you're thinking of

12 going.  So then I looked up what you have to have in

13 here, and it says the attorney general can have

14 regulations that would say something like I just said.

15 But I take it there are no such regulations.  And I take

16 it when it  it says, you know, the kinds of things you

17 have to report, I guess.  You know, you could get

18 something like that out of it, but you're not arguing

19 that.

20             MR. GANNON:  No, we're arguing that he

21 has 

22             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.

23             MR. GANNON:   an obligation to ensure that

24 the information in the registry is current.  That the

25 purpose of the registry is to enable to us to have a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 listing, to have the jurisdiction have a listing of

32

2 where sex offenders reside, are employed, or are a

3 student.  And it has failed in that purpose if it

4 inaccurately says he is living in Leavenworth, Kansas,

5 when that is the one place that he is not living.

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  So he's been living for 15

7 years in the Philippines where he is employed.  He now

8 changes his employment and he goes to work in Thailand.

9             Now does he have to tell Kansas?

10             MR. GANNON:  No, because 

11             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why is it?  I mean, Kansas

12 was once involved.

13             MR. GANNON:  Because  no.  Because Kansas

14 was not a registration where he was listed as being

15 employed.  If he were moving his job, his employer 

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, what he's done is he's

17 lived in the Philippines for 15 years, and now he's

18 changed his residence to South Korea.

19             Does he have to tell Kansas?

20             MR. GANNON:  No, Justice Breyer.

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  But 

22             MR. GANNON:  We believe that this

23 requirement is about updating the registration

24 information associated with his residence in Kansas.

25 And we think that Kansas remains involved.  So long as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
33 1 the registry says he is living in Leavenworth, Kansas  2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Gannon  3             MR. GANNON:   and he has not yet given 4 notification to at least one jurisdiction, that that is 5 no longer true. 6             JUSTICE KAGAN:  It seems to me that what 7 you're saying is that each of those offenders is 8 supposed to recognize the underlying purpose of the law, 9 which is to have accurate registries, and to do 10 everything he can to serve that underlying purpose.  And 11 we would  you know, it would be good if everybody did 12 that.  But the text of the law is something different. 13 And if you look at this text of the law, there's just no 14 way that a reasonable reader reads that text and says it 15 requires me to provide departure notification when I 16 leave to another country. 17             MR. GANNON:  Well  18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you can say well, he's 19 supposed to keep it current, and  and that's right. 20 He is  he should keep it current, because we would all 21 like sex registry.  But the statute provides very 22 specific details about what it means to keep it current, 23 and it seems to me he has conformed with every single 24 one of those requirements. 25             MR. GANNON:  And we just don't think that's
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
34 1 true, because Kansas was a jurisdiction that he could 2 have informed while he was still a resident.  That 3 doesn't even require this reading of  4             JUSTICE KAGAN:  You know, he could have, and 5 he should have. 6             MR. GANNON:  and that would have  7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But he didn't have to 8 under  9             MR. GANNON:   but  10             JUSTICE KAGAN:   this statutory language. 11             MR. GANNON:  But it is subsection (c) that 12 provides the content for what it means to keep the 13 registration current, and it says you have to inform at 14 least one jurisdiction.  He informed zero jurisdictions. 15 That's the problem here. 16             JUSTICE KAGAN:  It  it says he has to have 17 informed at least one jurisdiction involved pursuant to 18 subsection (a), and subsection (a) makes clear that the 19 only jurisdictions that they're talking about are the 20 jurisdictions in which he currently either lives, works, 21 or is a student. 22             MR. GANNON:  And that was true the morning 23 before he left Kansas and the morning he was going to 24 move out of his apartment.  And he could have said  25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And that morning 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MR. GANNON:   today is my last day in

35

2 Kansas; I'm a resident right now, but by the 

3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  That morning, everything was

4 current.  And then when he left Kansas, he's not subject

5 to this statutory provision anymore.

6             MR. GANNON:  He is subject to the provision

7 that requires him to keep it current.  He's given a

8 threebusinessday grace period, but if he fails to

9 comply with it by the end of the three business days

10 anywhere, that's what we think the problem is.  And so

11 we do think that 

12             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You  you agree 

13             MR. GANNON:   he could have done it 

14             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   that the problem has

15 been cured, prospectively.

16             MR. GANNON:  I  I  I think that the new

17 statute captures this type of conduct, effectively,

18 incidentally, because the new statute actually talks

19 about a much broader category of conduct.  It talks

20 about intended international travel.  It doesn't  it

21 doesn't talk per se about changes of residence, but it

22 does require you to report your itinerary and the

23 purpose of your travel.  Therefore 

24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So 

25             MR. GANNON:   we would expect it to pick

36

2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So  so who  who is

3 left out under the new law that would be covered under

4 your reading of the old law?

5             MR. GANNON:  I  I don't think any  my

6 point is not that somebody is left out under the new

7 law.  My point is that the new law captures many more

8 people.

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, I'm trying to find

10 out what is the effect 

11             MR. GANNON:  The 

12             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   of  of ruling one

13 way or another.  It's a relatively small category, and

14 there is no problem, prospectively.  Is that 

15             MR. GANNON:  Yes.  And we  we acknowledged

16 in our brief opposing certiorari that we thought that

17 this affected a small category of cases.  That was, of

18 course, before the new statute took effect.  And so we

19 do think that there will now  this type of conduct

20 will now be captured under the new statute, but we don't

21 think that the new statute indicates that Congress did

22 not think this conduct was captured under the old

23 statute, because it is directed at a much broader

24 category of conduct.

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understood  I 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
37 1 if I understood you correctly, there is still a category 2 of people under your interpretation today that would not 3 be covered under the new law, because you have to file 4 an itinerary, right? 5             MR. GANNON:  Yes. 6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Well, okay. 7 This person files an itinerary saying I'm flying to 8 the  the Philippines.  And if he takes up residence 9 there, then he's still violating the law, under your 10 interpretation? 11             MR. GANNON:  Well, that would be true, Mr. 12 Chief Justice, except that the language that we're 13 talking about here is the new subsection.  It would be 14 new 16914(a)(7), and it includes not just the itinerary, 15 but also, the offender has to report the means and 16 purpose of travel.  And so we're expecting that the 17 purpose of travel, if it  18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if his purpose is 19 I'm going to visit the Philippines, and while there, he 20 decides I'm going to set up permanent residence here, 21 then you would be able to prosecute him under this 22 provision, even though the new law doesn't cover it. 23             MR. GANNON:  Well, I think  24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  His purpose is to 25 visit the Philippines.  And while in the Philippines, he
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 decides to set up residence there.

38

2             MR. GANNON:  Well, then, I think that

3 would  that would raise a separate question, and would

4 mean that because his purpose had changed, we would 

5 we would have to find out whether the attorney general's

6 time and manner implementation of this provision, which

7 is also authorized under the new statute, requires him

8 to report such changes in purpose after he's already in

9 the Philippines.  And if so, and he doesn't say, well, I

10 thought I was here on vacation, but it turns out I'm

11 moving my residence, so that may well turn out also to

12 be a violation because he needs to report the purpose of

13 his travel has changed.

14             But my point is just that even though

15 Congress has now addressed intended international travel

16 and is expecting this to be reported in advance, as the

17 title of the new statute indicates, and therefore, we

18 wouldn't have to have this debate about whether this is

19 a jurisdiction in which he is currently residing when he

20 says, I intend to fly to the Philippines in 21 days.

21 That debate would  would be mooted out by the new

22 statute.

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you  you read

24 16913(a) as saying, where the offender resides or

25 resided, is an employee or was an employee, is a student

Alderson Reporting Company

1 or was a student.

Official

39

2             MR. GANNON:  I don't think that that's the

3 way we're reading the provision, Mr. Chief Justice.

4 We're saying that there are two obligations there:  one

5 is to register and the other is to keep the registration

6 current.  And if you allow the registry to have

7 inaccurate information, that when it  where you look

8 up your current address and it's not your current

9 address, then you've violated that obligation.  And we

10 think that subsection (c) provides additional

11 explanation as to what it means to keep the information

12 current.

13             And it says, you know what?  You don't have

14 to give advance information, advance notice that you're

15 going to be changing your residence.  You can do it up

16 to three business days thereafter.  But you have to

17 inform at least one jurisdiction involved.  And we think

18 that in that situation, especially because another

19 provision of the statute makes it clear that the

20 jurisdictions that are entitled to the information about

21 that change in residence include those from and to which

22 the change in residence is made, they get the

23 information.  They are involved 

24             JUSTICE KAGAN:  That 

25             MR. GANNON:   in  in 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
40 1             JUSTICE KAGAN:  That is 16921(b)?  Is that 2 the one you're referring to there? 3             MR. GANNON:  That's correct, 16921(b)(3), 4 which is on 11a of the government's brief. 5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But 16921(b)(3) is 6 specifically an obligation that's placed on officials. 7 It has nothing to do with any obligations on offenders. 8             MR. GANNON:  That is true, Justice Kagan, 9 but what we think it reveals is that it is telling us 10 which jurisdictions are involved in the exchange of 11 information that is at issue in the change of residence. 12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So but an offender is 13 supposed to look at a statute that places only an 14 obligation on State officials and to say, really?  That 15 obligation applies to me as well? 16             MR. GANNON:  No.  We think the offender is 17 supposed to look to the notices that he received, which 18 said he was supposed to provide notification of every 19 change of address.  I think any reasonable person, when 20 told that he has to give notification of his change of 21 address, says, oh, if I decide I'm moving out of the 22 country, I don't have to tell every  anybody, that 23 that  that is actually contrary to a commonsense 24 reading of this provision.  And we know that the notice 25 reinforces the idea that he does have to inform Kansas.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
41 1             Now, as Petitioner says, that's clear as a 2 matter of State law.  We also think that it's  that 3 it's part of the minimum requirements of SORNA, and we 4 don't think it's sufficient for the court to say, well, 5 Congress expected this to be a State law prosecution and 6 didn't want there to be a Federal law prosecution, 7 because that would be true of virtually every single 8 violation of Section 2250. 9             JUSTICE BREYER:  They might have, but it's 10 the language that's bothering people.  And what  I'm 11 trying to see if there is support for this word 12 "involved" which I hadn't really thought of. 13             And  and let's imagine he leaves Kansas. 14 He left on Monday.  It's now Tuesday.  So he doesn't 15 reside in Kansas anymore.  He's now over residing  16 he's not there anymore.  So is Kansas still a 17 jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a)? 18             MR. GANNON:  If  19             JUSTICE BREYER:  And your answer is "yes," 20 and I say  21             MR. GANNON:  If  22             JUSTICE BREYER:   okay.  You mean any 23 jurisdiction that he ever  no, you said it's not  it 24 doesn't mean "ever."  I said, does it mean involved 25 right now?  No, you said it doesn't mean that, because
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
42 1 if it's involved right now, it isn't.  You mean it was 2 involved two days ago? 3             And now you have a general definition of 4 that.  And you mean it was involved because it was the 5 last jurisdiction in which he actually resided.  That's 6 what you  now, is that basically it? 7             MR. GANNON:  No, not precisely it.  We mean 8 that it is involved because he has not told them, I am 9 no longer living in Kansas. 10             JUSTICE BREYER:  No, that can't be a reason 11 to be involved, because he didn't  I mean, there are a 12 lot of people he didn't tell.  I mean  13             MR. GANNON:  They are involved because he  14 he is on the rolls there as being a current resident. 15             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 16             MR. GANNON:  So he has an obligation  17             JUSTICE BREYER:  In other words, where he is 18 on the rolls as being a current resident  be careful, 19 because you run into Thailand, and you know, the  the 20 guy moved 50 years later  21             MR. GANNON:  Except he's not going to be on 22 the rolls there. 23             JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, he will be on the rolls 24 in Kansas because they never took him off, and  and 25 now it's 20 years later.  So you can't

43

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's take what you mean.

3 And now  now I  I have an idea of it.  What support

4 is there for that?  Is there support in a regulation?

5 Is there support in some previous case?  Is there

6 support  and I'm thinking focusing narrowly on your

7 interpretation of the word "involved."

8             MR. GANNON:  There is support in the

9 Attorney General guidelines to the extent that the

10 Attorney General 

11             JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.

12             MR. GANNON:   guidelines adopted in

13 2008  and we're not claiming Chevron deference to

14 them, but this has been our construction of the statute

15 all along.

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  Tell me where it is.

17             MR. GANNON:  The  the Attorney General

18 guidelines are reprinted at the end of our brief, and

19 they specifically say that he is obliged in order to

20 keep his registration information current, to 

21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the page, please?

22             MR. GANNON:  This is at page 22a.  It says,

23 "Even if he doesn't know where he is going next, he is

24 required to keep the registration information current by

25 informing the jurisdiction if he is terminating his

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 residence, employment or school attendance in the

44

2 jurisdiction."  That's true in the domestic context.

3             And then if you  if you go on to page 24,

4 it  it articulates the same requirement in the context

5 of needing to keep the registration current in

6 jurisdictions where someone resides when you're moving

7 out of the country.

8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This  this is not

9 an administrative law provision.  It's a criminal

10 statute.  The Attorney General's guidelines can't expand

11 a fair reading of what Congress made illegal under

12 Federal law.

13             MR. GANNON:  We're not claiming that the

14 Attorney General has expanded the text of the statute,

15 Mr. Chief Justice.  I'm just saying that this is the way

16 the Department of Justice has been construing the

17 statute since 2008.  Jurisdiction's implementing the

18 statute.  Understand this, and they've been informing

19 sex offenders that they have an obligation.

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And it's still

21 given  given what I just said, my  my answer is, so

22 what?  So what if the Attorney General has been

23 construing this since, you know, 1875?

24             MR. GANNON:  If  if 

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You cannot do

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 anything to expand the words that Congress used.

45

2             MR. GANNON:  That  that's  if  if you

3 disagree that this is a fair reading of the statute, I'm

4 not going to tell you that the guidelines make it a fair

5 reading of the statute.  I 

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What you're saying

7 is the Attorney General thinks it's a fair reading of

8 the statute.

9             MR. GANNON:  I'm 

10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So  so I should

11 think it's a fair reading of the statute.

12             MR. GANNON:  Well, I'm also telling you that

13 we think 

14             (Laughter.)

15             MR. GANNON:  I'm  I'm telling you that we

16 think we have good reasons for this construction, and

17 Justice Breyer asked if there's anybody who's ever

18 adopted this construction before, and I say, yes, the

19 Attorney General publicly did so in 2008.  All

20 SORNAimplementing jurisdictions were told this is the

21 way the Federal government reads the statute, and

22 they're supposed to inform sex offenders of this.

23             In this instance, Kansas has informed

24 Mr. Nichols that he has an obligation to provide notice

25 when he is terminating his residence.  They've gone

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1 above and beyond what SORNA requires by always demanding 2 that he inform Kansas, even though SORNA, under our 3 reading, would allow him to inform any one jurisdiction 4 involved.  We think  5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just to  I 6 probably should know this, but Kansas requires him to 7 list any change, right?  He has to unregister? 8             MR. GANNON:  He has to  he has to report 9 any change in the residence information, yes. 10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  What  what 11 sort of language did they use? 12             MR. GANNON:  That their language does  it 13 specifically says, "He must reregister any change or 14 termination of residence within three days to the 15 registering law enforcement agency or agencies where 16 last registered." 17             So that's the  18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it says "where 19 last registered." 20             MR. GANNON:  Where it specifically picks up 21 and says, you have to go back to where you last 22 registered, we think that goes beyond  that's the way 23 in which Kansas law goes beyond SORNA, because SORNA 24 does not always require that. 25             We think that in a situation like this,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 SORNA effectively required that, because there's no

47

2 other place for him to have gone.  But we also take

3 Petitioner's concession that SORNA permits him to comply

4 with the requirement to keep his registration current by

5 going to the office in Kansas.

6             And it's the same form.  There's no doubt

7 that it's possible for him to report the change in

8 residence there.  The form says, what is your address?

9 And it has location start date and location end date,

10 and those can be reported in advance or after the fact.

11             Our position is just that when SORNA gets

12 around to saying what it means to keep your registration

13 information current, you have to do that in at least one

14 place within three business days.  And so we think that

15 that means he could do it in Kansas even the day after

16 he moved.

17             If you disagree with that, we still think it

18 also must mean at least, as Justice Alito was

19 explaining, that he has to do it  he has to comply

20 with it by doing it while there still is one

21 jurisdiction.  There's no doubt that Kansas was a

22 jurisdiction involved while he was still residing there.

23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could I  could I ask a

24 question, Mr. Gannon, of absolutely no legal

25 significance?  Chalk it up to curiosity.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
48 1             Does the Federal government bring many of 2 these prosecutions?  Because I might have thought that 3 when sex offenders leave the country permanently, the 4 attitude might be like, good luck and good riddance? 5             (Laughter.) 6             MR. GANNON:  Well, I  I take the point, 7 Justice Kagan, but remember this is somebody who is not 8 just a Federal sex offender.  He's on Federal 9 supervisory release.  The notion that we have somebody 10 on Federal supervisory release, we're supposed to be 11 keeping track of him and making sure that he's not 12 committing other crimes.  If  13             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you're not  you're  14 as I understand the requirement that even you say he's 15 subject to, it's just a requirement that says he's 16 leaving the State.  It doesn't  he's not required to 17 tell you where he's going in the world.  He could be 18 going to the Philippines or any other country.  So it 19 doesn't really help us in terms of, you know, helping 20 our allies deal with sex offenders. 21             I'm just curious why it is that people  22 why DOJ makes the decision to bring sex offenders back 23 to this country in such circumstances. 24             MR. GANNON:  Well, as  as I said, he was a 25 Federal sex offender who was on Federal supervisory
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 release who appeared to be on the cusp of committing

49

2 additional Federal offenses in the Philippines, and so

3 we brought him back.  And we do think that there's a

4 Federal interest in this case.

5             But Section 2250 includes cases where

6 somebody is also violating State law, because by

7 definition, all of these registration requirements in

8 SORNA much of the time are also going to be violations

9 of State law.

10             And  and so in this instance, the problem

11 is that the registry was inaccurate.  It's supposed to

12 say where he's living.

13             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I am right, right, that when

14 you say he had the responsibility to keep the registry

15 accurate, that's just to say he had the responsibility

16 to tell Kansas he was no longer in Kansas.

17             MR. GANNON:  That's right.

18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Even on your view, he had no

19 other responsibilities.

20             MR. GANNON:  That  that's  that's the

21 applicable responsibility here.  That's right.

22             JUSTICE ALITO:  In terms of 

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How  how do we 

24 how do we know  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, please.

25             JUSTICE ALITO:  In terms of Federal policy,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
50 1 hasn't Congress, by the enactment of the new statute and 2 in other ways, evidenced a belief that the United States 3 should not be exporting its pedophile problems to other 4 countries? 5             MR. GANNON:  Yes, Justice  6             JUSTICE ALITO:  And countries like the 7 Philippines where the  the Petitioner here went are 8 known places that are attractive to sex tourists who go 9 there to abuse young children and  hasn't Congress 10 evidenced a concern about this both for the human rights 11 aspects of the problem and, also, I would think, for 12 relations with the government of the Philippines? 13             MR. GANNON:  Absolutely, Justice Alito.  And 14 it  it would have been a Federal offense for him to 15 have engaged in  in sexually elicit conduct in the 16 Philippines. 17             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  And I completely 18 understand that, Mr. Gannon, but even your own 19 interpretation doesn't get you the information  20             (Laughter.) 21             (Lights out.) 22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I knew we should 23 have paid that bill. 24             (Laughter.) 25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  My red light on the bench is

3             JUSTICE KAGAN:   does not get you the

4 information that you need in order to tell the

5 Philippines, look, you have a sex offender in your

6 midst.

7             MR. GANNON:  That's  that's correct,

8 Justice Kagan.  The new statute does that as did the

9 supplemental guidelines that the Attorney General

10 adopted in 2011 under SORNA as additional information

11 that was required.  That's not what's at issue in this

12 particular case.

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's so interesting is

14 that regulation tells the States to do this.

15             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It doesn't tell the sex

17 offender that he's obligated to do it.  It says the

18 States must do it.

19             MR. GANNON:  It's 

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  it's a little bit

21 odd.

22             MR. GANNON:  It's true that the guidelines

23 were addressed.  Both the guidelines and the

24 supplemental guidelines were addressed to implementing

25 jurisdictions.  They were articulating the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
52 1 government's construction of the statute and  and what 2 is required. 3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So now a sex offender is 4 supposed to understand what "involved" means and read a 5 directive to jurisdictions in your regulation and say, 6 ah, that includes me, too. 7             MR. GANNON:  Well, we  we  8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Jurisdiction is supposed 9 to do this, but now I've got to do something more. 10             MR. GANNON:  Well, but what the jurisdiction 11 was told is that it has to inform sex offenders that 12 they must do this, and that happened here.  Kansas 13 informed him that he had to provide notice of any 14 termination or change in his residence.  That's what was 15 required by SORNA. 16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What makes it a State as 17 opposed to a Federal crime?  That's really what's at 18 issue here. 19             MR.

Alderson Reporting Company

53 1 Petitioner acknowledges it's a State crime.  It is also 2 a Federal crime. 3             Mr. Chief Justice, May I finish answering? 4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Briefly. 5             MR. GANNON:  Under Section 2250, because 6 he's a Federal sexual offender, there doesn't even need 7 to be independent travel.  It's the violation of the 8 SORNA requirements that makes it a Federal offense. 9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 10             Mr. Hansmeier, you have 11 minutes 11 remaining. 12         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL T. HANSMEIER 13                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 14             MR. HANSMEIER:  Sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.  I 15 don't think I actually reserved time for rebuttal, so 16 thank you. 17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay. 18             MR. HANSMEIER:  I forgot to say that, but 19 thank you. 20             I would  21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh. 22             MR. HANSMEIER:  Justice Breyer, if I can  23 I'll  I'll be brief. 24             On the guidelines  this is actually a 25 direct quote  the  the  according to the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
54 1 Department of Justice, "A jurisdiction may require that 2 changes in registration information be reported by 3 registrants on a more stringent basis than the SORNA 4 minimum standards.  For example, requiring that changes 5 of residence be reported before the sex offender moves 6 rather than within three business days following the 7 move." 8             I mean, that's our position.  I don't  9 there are other portions in  in the guidelines that 10 direct jurisdictions to do this.  But that  but  but 11 what the  what the guidelines say right there is  is 12 exactly what we say, that it  it is a more stringent 13 requirement. 14             A few other points on the word "current."  I 15 think if you  if you look in the  in the  there's 16 a provision on inperson verifications where there is 17 requirements for a current photograph.  That word 18 clearly doesn't mean a future.  And I think that's 19 important to understand, that when you're talking about 20 current information, it's not future information.  I 21 think Justice Kagan mentioned that a few times. 22             On 1621  16921(b)(3), again, that's  23 that's language directed towards the jurisdictions. 24 That's not a requirement for the offender, and that's 25 how the former jurisdiction would be informed of the
