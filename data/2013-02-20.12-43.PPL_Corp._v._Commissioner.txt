1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:17 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in Case 12-43, PPL Corporation and Subsidiaries v. 5 the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. 6 Mr. Clement? 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 This case has its origins in a decision by 12 the British government in the Major Thatcher years to 13 privatize a number of previously State-owned utilities. 14 The government's plan was to keep prices constant and 15 allow the companies to make profits by increasing 16 efficiencies and reducing costs. Only after an initial 17 period in which prices would be fixed would the prices 18 be re-jiggered and then savings passed on to the 19 consumers. 20 Now, this, in practice, worked very well for 21 the companies. They were able to increase their 22 efficiencies and cut costs to a greater extent than 23 people expected. This was not, however, greeted as a 24 uniform success. Instead, the opposition party 25 criticized this and said that the fat cats at the
3

1 utility companies had earned too much and the 2 conservative government had made a mistake by valuing 3 the shares at IPO too cheaply. 4 And so they promised, as an express election 5 promise, to impose a tax on the excess profits of 6 privatized utilities. And, when elected, they made good 7 on that promise and passed the Windfall Act -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: See, I have a problem 9 with this argument because it assumes a way of looking 10 at this, but it's an assumption. You can look at it in 11 either way. You can look at it as they made too much 12 money, we want a part of that profit, or they paid too 13 little for what they got. 14 And that was the debate going on in 15 Congress. Did they pay too little on the floatation 16 value? Or did they make too much money? And what the 17 government says -- rightly -- is whether you paid too 18 much or too little money depends on the value of the 19 company. And one of the factors that goes into that is 20 how much money has the company made? 21 And so you always have to look at profits, 22 to some extent. So what's wrong with looking at it 23 their way? Why does it have to be your way? 24 MR. CLEMENT: Well, it has to be my way 25 because of the way the specific tax was designed. But
4

1 the first -2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, you can only do it 3 your way if you do what the amici says, which is to take 4 out from your simplified equation the fact that the 5 time -- the D element of your equation -- is constant. 6 You artificially freeze it the time at which they 7 operated. Only by freezing that number can you come out 8 with your equation. 9 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Your Honor, we're not 10 artificially freezing the -- the number. The number -11 the D -- 1461 for almost every company -- is, itself, 12 part of the statute because they picked a period by 13 which they were going to measure the profit in 14 value-making terms. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there was at least 16 two or three companies that had a very different period, 17 and they paid a huge amount, much further than their 18 gross profits. 19 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I can talk about the 20 outlying -21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because of that, D 22 changed for them. 23 MR. CLEMENT: I can talk about the outlying 24 companies. They paid a different effective rate because 25 the D was different. But there's two important things
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to remember. One, I believe it's common ground between 2 the parties, that the way you applied this regulation is 3 to look at the tax in -- to use the regulatory phrase -4 in the normal circumstances in which it applies. 5 So I believe it's common ground that you 6 ignore the outliers anyway. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you change the other 8 part of the equation -- or of the tax regulation, which 9 says it has to be true for all taxpayers. 10 MR. CLEMENT: No. That particular 11 provision -- think of it as like a Clark v. Martinez 12 principle for taxes. They either are creditable or 13 they're not. That's what that principle has been 14 interpreted to. The case you should look at, if you're 15 really interested in it, is the Exxon case, the tax 16 court, we cite it in both our briefs. 17 And, there, it was a situation where, again, 18 a British Excess Profits Tax, in the main, it was an 19 Excess Profits Tax on the companies that were developing 20 the North Sea oil field. But, as the tax applied to a 21 couple of companies that really hadn't gotten any oil 22 out, it applied very differently. 23 And the tax court and the government in that 24 case both conceded, no, you look at the tax in its main 25 applications. And in those main applications, everyone
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 concedes that this tax operates exactly like a 2 51.75 percent tax on profits above a threshold, a 3 threshold of 4/9ths of the floatation value. 4 And that is not an accident. That's not 5 some kind of tricky math thing that somebody pulled up. 6 It's right there in the statute itself because -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose everyone in the 8 case conceded that the purpose of this statute was to 9 compensate the government for having valued the shares 10 at too low a price, and this was stated right in the 11 enactment. Would that change your argument? 12 MR. CLEMENT: It wouldn't, Justice Kennedy, 13 because, at the end of the day, it's the substance of 14 the tax, not its purpose behind it that matters. Now, I 15 do think, in this case, as Justice Sotomayor alluded to, 16 everybody in this process really understood that those 17 were just the flip side of the same coin. 18 You can talk about the profits being too 19 high, vis-à-vis floatation, you can talk about 20 floatation being too low vis-à-vis the subsequently 21 reported profits, but what makes -22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose we think 23 this is both a tax on profits and a tax on low value. 24 Then what do we do? 25 MR. CLEMENT: Well, in this particular case,
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 you would say it's creditable because the only measure 2 of value here is by looking at retrospective earnings 3 over a 4-year period. And the best hypothetical I can 4 give you is think about a foreign government that says 5 we want to tax the value of corporations, but the way we 6 are idiosyncratically going to measure value is to look 7 at their earnings over the past year. 8 Now, I would hope that tax would be for U.S. 9 substantive economic tax purposes fully creditable. Of 10 course, it's a tax on income, by our eyes. Now, in 11 saying that, you're not suggesting that the other company -12 the other country did something wrong or that's not value in 13 their conception. 14 But the whole point that this Court made 15 clear in the Biddle case, going back 75 years ago, is 16 when you're looking at foreign taxes, for purposes of 17 applying the foreign tax credit, you don't take the 18 foreign characterizations, the foreign classifications, 19 as a given. You look at the substance of the tax for 20 our purposes. 21 And, if you look -- if you apply that 22 mechanism to this tax, this tax looks exactly like a 23 U.S. Excess Profits Tax. It is really -24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, if I -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose it's a one -- if I
8

1 could just -- suppose -- we say, well, this is a 2 one-time tax, in order to recalculate, reassess the 3 value. If it's on income, it's still an Excess Profits 4 Tax, in your view? 5 MR. CLEMENT: Yes. And, of course, you 6 could have had a one-time, one-off tax, to use the 7 British phrase, and you could have taxed the difference 8 between the value at floatation and -- let's say the 9 London Stock Exchange price at some later point. And 10 that would have been a normal estimate of value, and it 11 would not have been creditable for a number of reasons. 12 But when you do what this tax uniquely did, 13 which is you don't look at a normal rubric of value, but 14 you look at a construct -- I mean, the very fact that 15 they had to use the phrase "value in profit-making 16 terms" tells you something weird's going on here. I 17 mean, if they were really -18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Clement, is there 19 another example -- Justice Kennedy mentioned that this 20 was what they call "one-off." It's one time only, and 21 it's retrospective. Is -- is there any instance in 22 which a foreign tax credit has been given to something 23 that looks like this, a one-time only adjustment that 24 is -- that operates retrospectively on past earnings? 25 MR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, I can't put
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 all the pieces of that together and say there's one case 2 that had all of these various features, and then it was 3 still creditable, but I don't think that matters. It's 4 very clear, I think, for starters, that the fact that 5 this is a retroactive tax is not dispositive. 6 You look at one of the regulatory 7 requirements, and that's realization. And that treats 8 an estimate of future income generation very differently 9 because that doesn't involve a realization event. But 10 what the regulation says is that the tax has to be 11 imposed upon or subsequent to. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My fear is, as warned by 13 the government and the tax professors, that the rule you 14 want us to announce to help you win is to say anytime a 15 tax uses estimates of profits, no matter how it does it, 16 it is credible -- creditable. That's the rule you want. 17 MR. CLEMENT: No, it is not. It is 18 emphatically not. And let me tell you why there is no 19 slippery slope here. First, the big thing they want to 20 tell you is this is a normal way of valuation. And, if 21 you allow this, then any valuation is going to be 22 creditable. That is flat wrong, and the reason that's 23 flat wrong is because almost every effort in valuation 24 is prospective. 25 If you want to try to value a piece of
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 property, you could value it by saying, well, what kind 2 of rents can I get on this property, and I'll discount 3 them back to net present value. And I suppose you can 4 conceive of a property tax as a tax on a percentage of 5 those projected future earnings. 6 But you know what? Easily obviously not 7 creditable because the first requirement on the 8 regulation is that there be a realization event. And 9 when you're talking about projected future income 10 streams, there's no realization events. So all of those 11 are off the table. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why isn't that to say 13 I want to find the original floatation value, and, 14 instead of estimating what the profits are, I'm simply 15 going to use the ones that happen? 16 MR. CLEMENT: Exactly -17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why is that 18 different? 19 MR. CLEMENT: Because you never would do 20 that in any normal valuation. What you would do -21 occasionally, in valuation, you have to go back in time. 22 This isn't the only place in the world that anybody 23 said, I wonder what Google's stock was worth, like, back 24 in the day. 25 But, when you do that for valuation
11

1 purposes, the first rule of thumb is to avoid hindsight 2 bias, and so this tax uniquely taxes nothing, but 3 hindsight bias. It's going back to 1990 -4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there -- there is 5 an argument about that because it has two components 6 that you keep ignoring, the floatation value and the 7 time that the company -8 MR. CLEMENT: I would love to talk about 9 those other variables. The floatation value -- I mean, 10 it's a tax between the difference between -- between two 11 variables. 12 The reason I am focusing on the value and 13 profit-making terms is because it's the larger of the 14 two numbers, and the tax falls in the difference between 15 the two, and the floatation value is basically taken as 16 a given. And -17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. -- I'm sorry, 18 please. 19 MR. CLEMENT: Go ahead. I mean, I could 20 talk floatation value all day. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'd really like to 22 hear -- I'd really like to hear what you are going to 23 say. 24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. Then let me ask you 25 my question.
12

Alderson Reporting Company

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wait, Justice Kagan. 2 No, Justice Kagan. 3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ok. Do you agree -- I mean, you 4 said we should look to the way this is designed, so 5 let's look to the way that the actual formula is 6 designed. 7 Do you agree that this tax would impose 8 identical tax liability for companies with -- at the 9 same average profits, but could impose very different 10 tax liability for companies with the same total profits? 11 That's the way the thing is designed, is it 12 not? 13 MR. CLEMENT: Yes, and that's true of every 14 Excess Profits Tax, Your Honor. What matters for those 15 tax -16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's the question. 17 Is that true of every Excess Profits Tax? Take a -- a 18 hypothetical like this: You have two companies, Company 19 A and Company B, and one company operates over four 20 years and makes a lot of money, and one company operates 21 over one year and makes only a quarter of that amount of 22 money. 23 Now, a typical Excess Profits Tax is going 24 to take Company A, which has made a lot of money, and -25 and it's going to end up paying four times as much tax
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 as Company B, which has made only a quarter of the 2 amount of money. But, under this tax, Company A and 3 Company B pay the exact same thing; isn't that right? 4 MR. CLEMENT: No. They -- they would pay 5 different taxes. I mean, they pay the same rate -6 JUSTICE KAGAN: One year or four years? 7 Four -8 MR. CLEMENT: They have the same -- they'd 9 have the same rate. They'd have -- I mean, 10 the same calculation, but it would affect them very 11 differently. But in -12 JUSTICE KAGAN: In other words, a company 13 that has made four times as much profits under this 14 formula could pay the same tax; isn't that right? 15 MR. CLEMENT: I -- I don't think -16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Because it was operating 17 four times as long. 18 MR. CLEMENT: Right. 19 JUSTICE KAGAN: And because there is that D 20 variable. 21 MR. CLEMENT: Right -- that's right. But, 22 of course, the floatation value is going to play a 23 bigger role in the other company -24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Assuming the floatation 25 value is the same for both companies.
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. CLEMENT: Then -- then maybe it could, 2 Justice Kagan, but let me say two things about that -3 JUSTICE KAGAN: It definitely could. It 4 would have to. And that's because what this is trying 5 to tax is not total profits. This is trying to tax 6 average profits, or what may be the better way to say 7 it, is it's taxing profitability and not profits. 8 MR. CLEMENT: No. With all due respect, 9 it's taxing profits above a threshold, and the threshold 10 is determined by floatation value. For most companies 11 that the tax applies -- and that is the way you look at 12 the creditability of these taxes, you ignore the 13 outlier. For most of those companies, it's going to be 14 4/9ths of the floatation value. 15 JUSTICE KAGAN: But -- but the reason why 16 this formula was devised in the way that this formula 17 was devised was specifically to get at the outlier. In 18 other words, it was to get at the company that only 19 operated for a short amount of time, but they wanted 20 that company to pay just as big a tax bill as the 21 company that had operated for a much longer amount of 22 time and had made many more profits. 23 So the end result is that this company that 24 operates for a very short amount of time and makes 25 almost no excess profits pays the exact same tax bill as
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 a company with four times as much excess profits. 2 MR. CLEMENT: No, that's not right, Your 3 Honor. I -- it really is not. And what they were 4 trying to do -- first of all, the outliers, the reason 5 they included them in is they figured they had to 6 because it fit within their definition of the regulated 7 companies they were trying to catch. 8 Now, they knew they had -- and this is only 9 two companies we are talking about -- they knew they had 10 a shorter period, so they knew this would fall 11 differently on them as a substantive matter no matter -12 no matter how they did it. 13 The reason they didn't care much is because 14 those companies got something that the other companies 15 didn't, which is they got to operate for the next three 16 years in a favorable regulatory environment in which no 17 Excess Profits Tax would be imposed on them. So it may 18 look like they have a higher rate -- effective rate 19 under our calculation. 20 They do have a higher effective rate over 21 a -- over a relatively small amount over the threshold, 22 but they make that up, essentially, in the out-years 23 because they make money under the favorable regulatory 24 regime. 25 And, again, the theory of this is, for four
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 years after floatation, there is a favorable regulatory 2 regime in which they make excess profits. Those two 3 companies get to make money in the out-years, two, 4 three, four, without any excess profits because it was 5 really important for them to make this a one-off tax. 6 But if I can get back to your question 7 because there is this phenomenon -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Why -- why 9 didn't -- why weren't they subject to a favorable 10 regulatory regime in two, three, and four? 11 MR. CLEMENT: They were. They weren't -12 but they weren't subject to any tax for it because, 13 remember, they -- this is very important for Labour. 14 They are coming in after 20 years of conservative rule. 15 They don't want to be the old Labour party. They don't 16 want to put in a new permanent tax, so they want to do 17 this once. 18 And so that works great for my clients 19 because they -- they were privatized in 1990. But, when 20 they're doing this in 1997, they get a couple of 21 outlying companies that were only privatized in '96. So 22 what they do is they hit them with a reasonably tough 23 tax in year one, but year two, three, and four, they 24 were in a favorable regulatory environment, and they get 25 no tax at all. So -- you know, don't -- don't cry any
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 tears for them. 2 Now, the point I thought you were going 3 to ask me, though, is, even with the companies with the 4 same denominator, it is true that companies with the 5 same profits can be subjected to different taxes, but 6 that's because it's an Excess Profits Tax. And that is 7 what is true of -8 JUSTICE KAGAN: No, but even companies with 9 the exact same profits and the exact same floatation 10 value can be subject to different taxes, and that's a 11 result of the amount of time, that's a result of the D 12 variable. If you were right -13 MR. CLEMENT: With respect, that's only true 14 of -15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Excuse me. If you were 16 right, the D variable wouldn't exist. If this were an 17 Excess Profits Tax, it would have been written without a 18 D variable because they would not have cared whether it 19 was four years or one year or any place in-between. 20 MR. CLEMENT: With respect, I disagree 21 because, first of all, it's only those two companies, 22 from what you said, is -- it could possibly be true. As 23 to the rest of the companies, the reason that they were 24 trying to use D is because they were trying to capture 25 the excess profits during a period in which there is a
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 particular regulatory environment with -- where they -2 where they thought they earned excess profits. 3 For all of the companies they reached, that 4 period was the D with the exception of the outliers, and 5 the reason they had a different outlier is because they 6 were recently privatized. But, if you think about the 7 substance of this tax, it is taxing -- their term -8 value and profit-making terms, but not any abstract 9 profit-making terms, profits over a reported period. 10 JUSTICE KAGAN: If you were right, it would 11 just be a 52 percent tax on annual profits above 1/9th 12 of floatation value, and it's not that. It's not 13 that -- specifically, in order to get at railroad track, 14 which would have paid very little tax under your 15 formula, but, instead, pays a great amount of tax 16 because they think that railroad track got the same good 17 deal at the beginning as all these other companies did, 18 but -- so, even though they didn't make very much 19 in the way of excess profits, they were going to tax 20 them just as much. 21 MR. CLEMENT: Because they had three free 22 years in the out-years. And, if you are looking at how 23 this applies, in the normal circumstances of its 24 application, then you don't have the full analysis of a 25 railroad track.
19

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem with their 2 argument, Mr. Clement, is that you are undermining your 3 own argument. If they are getting three full years at a 4 lesser tax, it's because their floatation value was made 5 more equal by this formula. 6 MR. CLEMENT: No, that's not right. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So they don't need to be 8 taxed any more, moving forward, because they got it 9 right. 10 MR. CLEMENT: No, that's -- with all due 11 respect, that's not right. The floatation value is 12 calculated the same way for each of these companies, and 13 the theory of why the floatation value is too low is the 14 same for all of them, which is, under the regulatory 15 policies, they are going to hold the prices firm for a 16 four-year period, and they are going to increase 17 efficiencies and reduce costs, and they are going to 18 make money. 19 That is supposed to incentivize them, and 20 then that's the basis for all the regulatory policies 21 going forward. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: I wanted -- I just wanted 23 to hear what you were going to say in answer to the 24 second part of Justice Sotomayor's earlier question. 25 And, to remind you of that, you were going to explain to
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 us, which I felt I needed, the second term -- that 2 second term. And that just says, "FV," for value. 3 MR. CLEMENT: Right. Right. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: But I did notice, that if 5 you make .23 times fair value, not quite by coincidence, 6 happens to be what the companies would have made over 7 a period of 2 years in profit, had it been the truth 8 that the value of such companies was, as valued by the 9 market, 9 times their earnings because a company that's 10 valued 9 times its earnings earns about 11 point 11 something percent per year -- taking aside all other 12 factors -- and 2 years' worth is that. 13 And I don't know if I've got that part 14 right, but, if I do have that part right, then what this 15 tax does is it takes the profits the firms actually -16 actually made over 2 years -- not quite actually. It 17 assumes twice the -- the value of the first year. 18 You see, so whatever they made the first 19 year -- and, if it's only 6 months, it's twice 6 20 months -- you know -- that first part figures out what 21 they really made over the first year and then multiplies 22 it by two. And you take that, and you subtract from 23 that the amount that they would have made over 2 years. 24 Now -- so it looked, to me, pretty -- this 25 helps you, of course, but -- but it also is calculated
21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 on an average, the average of the first year's profit, 2 they consider that the average; and, therefore, they are 3 right in saying -- you know, a firm that was only in 4 business for 6 months will be taxed -- the whole 2-year 5 extra will be taken away, even when there was no 2-year 6 extra, you see? So that firm would have paid more than 7 their gross income. 8 Of course, there is no such firm, and that's 9 their problem, but we come to that later. But I want 10 your view, if you can -- if I've explained it clearly 11 enough, so you get where I'm coming from, and -- and -12 if -- if I have explained that clearly enough, I'd really 13 appreciate what you think about it. 14 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I -- I think so, but I 15 think I get there in a slightly different way because I 16 guess I don't see the natural relationship between the 17 23 percent and the floatation value, but I think I get 18 to a similar place, which is, if you think about it the 19 way that we formulate it, it's 51.75 percent of 4/9ths 20 of floatation value. 21 Now, the -- the floatation value is 22 calculated based on the initial share price, plus the 23 number of shares. And the initial share price for all 24 the electrical utilities was 2 pounds, 40 pence. So 25 it's just 2 pounds, 40 pence, by however many shares
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 there were. Okay. So that's floatation value. 2 The -- the floor for the excess profits is 3 4/9ths of floatation value. Now, if you want to get it 4 on an annualized average basis and if you want to -- you 5 know, this is at 64a of the petition appendix when the 6 Tax Court did it -- but what that means in practice is 7 this tax is taxing 51.75 percent of the profits above 8 1/9th of the floatation -9 JUSTICE BREYER: It will do that for firms 10 that are in business for 4 years. 11 MR. CLEMENT: Yes. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Absolutely. It won't do 13 that for a firm that was in business 6 months. And -14 and -15 MR. CLEMENT: It -- it will give you a 16 different number. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: A very different number. 18 MR. CLEMENT: Yes. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Indeed, a number that could 20 exceed the money -- all the money they really make in 21 the next 2 years. 22 MR. CLEMENT: That's not true. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: I could. 24 MR. CLEMENT: I mean, of any company here -25 of any company here, that's not true.

CLEMENT: It's stipulated -5 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- but -- but some, 6 particularly on the other side, want to make quite a lot 7 out of that fact. And they want to make quite a lot out 8 of the fact that for that single -- whatever it's called 9 railroad something -10 MR. CLEMENT: Railtrack.

And that
24

1 is all that really matters. 2 They want to focus on the fact that, well, 3 for a lot of these companies, the base amount was larger 4 than the -- than their initial period profits. Who 5 cares? I mean, that's just an artificial number. 6 This -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's go back to my 8 initial question. What's the rule? If someone uses 9 your actual profits in any way, it's a credit that they 10 are entitled to? 11 MR. CLEMENT: No. I don't think so because, 12 again -13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I don't know how 14 you get around it because you seem to be saying to us 15 that, no matter how -- what formula you create, so long 16 as we can simplify it in math to affect which -- take 17 any variables in it and fix them in any way, that's a 18 creditable tax. That seems to be what your argument is. 19 MR. CLEMENT: No, it's not, 20 Justice Sotomayor. Now, there's two things your 21 question, I think, got to; one, I thought I already 22 dealt with, which is future valuation is not a problem. 23 There is no realization of it. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I'm saying to you 25 that any tax that relies upon actual profits, in any
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 way, you say is wrong. 2 MR. CLEMENT: And it's not right or wrong. 3 We would say it's creditable, if that's its predominant 4 character. So if you want to put that as part of a 5 ten-factor test, where past realized profits is one of 6 the ten factors, but you also look at real market 7 valuation and some other factor, then I'm probably going 8 to lose. 9 But, in this instance, the only moving 10 factor -- the only thing that changes from 11 company-to-company, other than the floatation value, 12 which is fixed, is their profits. And nobody -- you 13 know, nobody doubts -14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, the floatation value 15 is not fixed. It was different for each company. 16 MR. CLEMENT: Right. But -17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They only fixed the 18 percentage that they're going to use, but the actual 19 amount paid was different for every company. 20 MR. CLEMENT: But, again, that is classic 21 Excess Profits Tax. So let me try to come at it this 22 way, which is to say, suppose you had a country that had 23 a tax that said, we are going to tax your value, and we 24 are going to measure your -- your -- your value based on 25 the income you made in the last year or the last 2
26

1 years. 2 Now, I would say that that is clearly a 3 creditable income tax. If they said the same thing, we 4 are going to tax your value, and we are going to 5 calculate your value based on your income over the last 6 2 years, but we are going to subtract 10 percent of your 7 market cap, that would be an Excess Profits Tax. 8 The market cap would be different for every 9 company, so there would be another thing that was 10 different for each company, and the effective rate might 11 be different, but that's okay because that's how an 12 excessive profits tax works. 13 The last thing I'd say before I go sit down 14 is that's how the 1917 United States Excess Profits Tax 15 worked. In 1918, when Congress said that foreign excess 16 profits taxes are creditable, surely, that's what they 17 had in mind, and this is very similar to that classic, 18 prototypical Excess Profits Tax. 19 If I could reserve the remainder of my time? 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 21 Ms. O'Connell? 22 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL 23 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 24 MS.

1 The windfall tax is not an income tax. It 2 tax -- is a tax on an increment of company value. A 3 company's profits multiplied by a price to earnings 4 ratio is a typical way of imputing a value on a company. 5 Using profits as one variable in that valuation formula 6 does not transform a tax on company value into an income 7 tax. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that's a way of 9 estimating future value. I -- I don't know that anybody 10 values a company that -- that is sold on the market by 11 saying how much money did they make in the last 2 years, 12 and we are going to multiply that by 9. You look at 13 what people were paying you in the market. 14 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, Justice Scalia, the -15 what Parliament was trying to do here was to impute a 16 value on the company for which it should have been sold in 17 1990. And so using a stock price at some later date 18 would not have been an adequate proxy to determine what 19 that value should have been. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: If they know what it really 21 was, I guess they're all billionaires. You've got 22 triple billionaires. I mean, if you could go and figure 23 out what companies could really be sold at, as opposed 24 to what the market says, I think I have the solution for 25 you. I don't know why either of us is working here.

1 (Laughter.) 2 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, the point is that 3 Parliament was trying to come up with a value that it 4 should have charged for these companies in 1990 and -5 you know -6 JUSTICE BREYER: So, since there is no real 7 value, I -- I mean, maybe there is because they did it 8 in the form of an IPO, and the share then went the next 9 day into the market, and, when it went the next day into 10 the market, did the market pay a lot more? 11 MS. O'CONNELL: Yes, it did. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Really? 13 MS. O'CONNELL: There -- there is -14 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then you could 15 use that. You could use that, I guess. 16 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, but if you use -17 JUSTICE BREYER: But, how does that relate 18 to the number 9? 19 MS. O'CONNELL: If you use just the profits 20 on the next day, that wouldn't capture all of the 21 efficiencies that were realized over the -22 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes. But, of course, 23 in the -- in the past, we are making a prediction 24 about what efficiencies will be realized, and, in the 25 future, we know. So the one thing we don't know, since

1 life is risky -- or we do know for sure -- is whatever 2 it shows up to be in the future couldn't have been the 3 value that shareholders would put on it in the past 4 because they know life a risky. 5 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, that is true. And 6 that is one thing that is -- is the -7 JUSTICE BREYER: So the reason that that is 8 relevant here, of course, is this number 9 is a made-up 9 number. It may be made up by great experts, but since 10 they are all not geniuses who are -- own the whole 11 world, they must not be perfect experts. 12 MS. O'CONNELL: It is -- it is -13 JUSTICE BREYER: Isn't that true? 14 MS. O'CONNELL: The number 9 was not an 15 arbitrary number. It was -16 JUSTICE BREYER: No, it was a number picked 17 by whatever company had -- what is it, the -- the lowest 18 price earnings ratio or something like that. 19 MS. O'CONNELL: Right. The lowest average 20 price ratio. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. But that doesn't -22 that means whatever company that the shareholders 23 thought would deviate the least from whatever the return 24 was and that doesn't apply the others. But you don't 25 want a lecture from me on this subject.

1 What I want is an answer from you, and the 2 answer I want from you is this: As I read it and once 3 understand that this number is a semi made-up number, I 4 did look at that second term, and I thought that .23 5 times 9 is about 2 years' worth -- about 2 years' worth 6 of profits that would be expected, all things left out 7 of it, except profit. 8 And so then, once I saw that, I looked at 9 the first term. And the first term seemed, to me, to be 10 their actual profit -- their actual profit on an annual 11 basis multiplied by about the same number, you see? 12 And so what we do is we take -- about 13 multiplying, you see -- so we take about two years' 14 worth of profit that they actually made, and we subtract 15 from that two years' worth that our experts tell us they 16 should have made as -- on the basis of the original 17 market price. The rest is excess profit, and we seize 18 all of it, for two years only. 19 And, by the way, if a company had only six 20 months' worth, well, then -- you know, they might really 21 be hurt because, after all, they only earned six months 22 at the annual rate that showed something, and maybe they 23 didn't really earn it over the next 18 months. But the 24 reply was there was no such company. And, of course, 25 because time periods vary, rates will vary.

1 But I don't know that that matters for an 2 income tax. It's not a question of the rate; it's a 3 question on what you impose it. And you impose it on 4 income because, as he says, there are two choices here. 5 Number is really calculated on the basis of income, and 6 there is another number going on, the actual floatation 7 value, and this third thing, which is called the number 8 9. But, primarily, it is the income that makes the 9 difference. 10 Now, that's his argument. What's your 11 response? That's his argument, as I understand it. I 12 don't want to put words in his mouth. But you -- you 13 explain it to me. 14 MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Breyer, I think the 15 problem with -- when we start to reformulate what this 16 tax is or is not taxing or what the amount of the actual 17 tax is, just shows the danger of trying to reformulate 18 what parliament actually did in trying to determine if 19 it's an income tax. 20 As the professor's amicus brief points out, 21 if you reformulated this into an average annual profit 22 or left the P over 4 as it was and then divided 23 everything else by 9, this would become a 207 percent 24 tax on -25 JUSTICE BREYER: But I said, so what? Now,
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 you can answer that by saying, no, it's not so what. I 2 mean, isn't an income tax dependant upon whether it's a 3 tax on income, not the rate? And -- and whether some 4 companies pay a high rate and others pay a low rate, 5 even if that's totally arbitrary, wouldn't make a 6 definition to the characterization. 7 MS. O'CONNELL: In that characterization -8 JUSTICE BREYER: As long as you're not -9 they actually have the gross income from which this 10 comes. 11 MS. O'CONNELL: In that characterization, 12 Justice Breyer, the 207 percent of average annual 13 profits over 1/9th of floatation value, then, no, it's 14 not an income tax and the rate does matter because it's 15 completely confiscatory of that profits base. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: No, it will. Wait, wait, 17 wait, wait. It is greater than the profit they earned 18 during the year, but it is not greater than the profit 19 that they earned during the two years -- or whatever the 20 period is that everybody's paying this on. 21 MS. O'CONNELL: Right. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? 23 MS. O'CONNELL: Which -- which -- it's true. 24 It's true. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: So, here, by good luck for
33

Alderson Reporting Company

1 them or bad luck for you or whatever it is, they have 2 not taxed more than the gross income of the companies. 3 Is that -- is that -4 MS. O'CONNELL: They have not taxed more 5 than the total profits over a four-year period, which 6 is -7 JUSTICE BREYER: Four-year period. Well, 8 that's -- well -- well, is it not going to be an income 9 tax if what the U.S. government says, though it hasn't 10 said it, it could say, we want -- we want 35 percent of 11 what you earn over six years. Okay. That's what we 12 want. Now, that's still an income tax, isn't it? 13 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, the U.S. income tax -14 what the regulation looks for is taxes that have the 15 essential features of the U.S. income tax. And, no, the 16 U.S. income tax has never been imposed on a multiple of 17 profits. It's -- it's imposed as a percentage of -18 JUSTICE BREYER: So you say whatever -- if 19 they impose it on more than a year, any -- any country 20 that calculates the income tax over a period for more 21 than a year is outside the tax treaty because it's 22 essential to the nature of the American income tax 23 system that it be calculated year by year. 24 You're hesitating to say that, but 25 I think -

1 MS. O'CONNELL: Yes, I am. I am. I think 2 if there was a country that imposed an income tax every 3 six years and said, every sixth year, you'll pay an 4 income tax over the last six years, then that would 5 probably still be an income tax. 6 But the point is that, here, that's not 7 anything close to what they're doing or what Parliament 8 has done. Parliament has taken a valuation formula, 9 where it takes an actual earnings figure from the 10 company -- an average annual earnings figure, and 11 multiplies it by a price-to-earnings ratio to impute a 12 value on the company. 13 It then subtracts out what it actually 14 received for the company, which we think shows that the 15 substance of this tax is that it's a tax on an increment 16 of company value. Parliament is calculating what it 17 should have sold the company for, subtracting out what 18 it actually received. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel -20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, could you -- I'm 21 sorry. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We had a lot of -23 your friend had a lot of questions on the different 24 periods -- the initial periods and changing the D value 25 and what that did to the -- that is not an argument that
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 you've made, is it? 2 MS. O'CONNELL: That's right. I think we 3 generally agree with the Petitioner that a tax is -- is 4 either an income tax or not an income tax for everybody 5 that's subject to the tax and that you look at it in the 6 normal circumstances in which it applies. 7 But -- but I do completely agree that the 8 fact that the D figure changes makes this -- just 9 reinforces the idea that the substance of this tax -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that is -11 again, that's not an argument you've made. 12 MS. O'CONNELL: No, but our the amicus did 13 make it. I mean, that -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the amicus 15 did, but I don't think we should do a better job of 16 getting money from people than the IRS does. 17 (Laughter.) 18 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, the point is that -19 the fact that there is a D variable there shows that 20 what Parliament was trying to do was to place an annual 21 earnings figure on each company to create a value for 22 it. A company -- it's not similar to an Excess Profits 23 Tax in that way, that where a company that operated for 24 only six months is paying the tax at the same level that 25 a company would be that was making profits at the same
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 rate for the entire four-year period. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's a good 3 articulation of the argument you haven't made. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are accepting the 5 position the government made in PPL v. Exxon. You're 6 not disavowing the position you took there? 7 MS. O'CONNELL: Right. But it -- it depends 8 on the normal circumstances in which it applies. But -9 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you're -- you're not 10 saying that the amicus brief is wrong. The Chief 11 Justice is, of course, right, the amicus brief is the 12 amicus brief, and the amicus brief develops this 13 argument, which I think is the right argument. But 14 you're not saying that's wrong? 15 MS. O'CONNELL: It's not wrong. We think 16 that both the -- the D variable and the flotation value 17 variable add extra support for the idea that this is a 18 tax on an increment of company value. The D shows that 19 it's trying to impute an annual earnings figure on each 20 company. 21 The floatation value shows that it's not 22 concerned just with how profitable any particular 23 company is, but with how profitable it is in relation to 24 what the UK government received for it as value when it 25 floated the company.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you were 2 saying that that argument was wrong because you looked 3 to the predominant character of the tax and that it's 4 either a tax -- it's either an income tax or it's not. 5 It wouldn't be an income tax on the vast 6 majority of the companies where it was the same and not 7 on the companies where it was a large value or the other 8 way around. You look at the predominant characteristic 9 and you decide whether it's a tax or not on that basis. 10 MS. O'CONNELL: That's right. But I'm not 11 saying that the -- that the argument the amicus are 12 making is wrong. We're -- we're just saying -13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Because they're saying this 14 is not an income for anybody because, in fact, this 15 doesn't tax anybody's income. It taxes annual -- excuse 16 me -- it taxes average profits, not total profits. It 17 taxes profitability as a mechanism to tax value. 18 MS. O'CONNELL: That particular aspect of 19 the amicus brief that says, if it's bad for one, it's 20 bad for all, yes, that is not our position. If it -- it 21 is not our position, that you look at the tax based on 22 the normal circumstances in which it applies. 23 So I think we are in general agreement with 24 PPL that, if there are outliers, where net gain would be 25 totally confiscated, you'd look at it in the -- in the
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 normal circumstances in which it applies. That's what 2 the regulation says. 3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, now, I'm totally 4 confused because this outlier is an outlier not because 5 the tax hasn't worked. It's an -- it's an outlier that 6 the tax is designed to get at, that this formula was 7 developed with this D variable, in order to make sure 8 that outliers, meaning people -- companies that operated 9 for only a short amount of time would still pay a 10 significant tax bill. 11 So the whole design of this tax was to get 12 at the outlier. That seems, to me, to suggest that the 13 predominant character of the tax is not an income tax, 14 but is, instead, a value tax. 15 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, I mean, you could also 16 get to that by saying that the predominant character of 17 this tax is -- is not an income tax because of the way 18 that it applies to everybody else. I think that's our 19 principal argument. 20 If there were some outlying companies for 21 which this didn't look like an income tax, I think the 22 regulation allows some flexibility there where it says, 23 we look at it in the normal circumstances in which it 24 applies. And, if that makes it an income tax, then it's 25 an income tax for everybody.

1 I think an important point here is that the 2 Petitioners have conceded that if Parliament had chosen 3 a different valuation method, like the stock price, for 4 any particular company and then subtracted out the 5 floatation value, that that would not be a tax on 6 income, that that would be a value tax. 7 The fact that Parliament chose a different 8 way to place a value on each company shouldn't become a 9 tax on income just because profits is one variable in 10 that tax equation. That would open up many foreign 11 taxes that just use this typical earnings times the 12 price-to-earnings ratio for an income tax credit -- a 13 dollar-for-dollar credit in the United States, just 14 because the tax was written that way. 15 We think what Parliament was doing here was 16 clearly trying to impute a value on each company and 17 then subtracting out what it actually received. In 18 substance, it's a tax on value, as well as in form. 19 If the Court thinks that both of the 20 formulas are equivalent, the tax that Parliament 21 actually wrote and the rewritten tax of 51.75 percent of 22 your four years of profits over 4/9ths of the floatation 23 value, then there is a couple of reasons that you should 24 go with the tax that Parliament actually wrote. 25 The first is that exemptions from taxation
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 are construed narrowly, and a business -- a foreign 2 income tax that is paid to a foreign -- or I'm sorry -3 a foreign tax that is paid to a foreign government that 4 is not an income tax is usually just treated as a 5 deduction. 6 And the IRS has said, throughout this case, 7 that it is perfectly happy to treat this windfall tax as 8 a deduction; it just would not get a dollar-for-dollar 9 credit -10 JUSTICE BREYER: On that -- on the question 11 of how to treat, I -- there isn't authority, but, I 12 mean, if I'm quite honest about how I think about it, I 13 think the people in the tax court actually, usually, 14 know more about it than the judges who are not on the 15 tax court. 16 And so when I get an opinion and the tax 17 court all thinks one thing and then the court of appeals 18 is thinking something else and it's highly technical, 19 I -- I tend to be tempted to say, well, the tax courts 20 deserve something. 21 Now, is there anything, really? Am I just 22 doing that wrong, if I did that? 23 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, Justice Breyer, with 24 due respect to the tax court, the tax court didn't even 25 analyze any of the three regulatory tests that are set
41

1 forth in the regulation. I -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you would -3 you would answer that, that the Commissioner gets some 4 credit, too. This is the Commissioner -- this is a 5 Treasury regulation. So one question is: Do we owe 6 that regulation any kind of -- any kind of deference? 7 MS. O'CONNELL: Yes. I think, to the extent 8 that there is any ambiguity about what the regulation 9 means, then the Commissioner's interpretation of his own 10 regulation is entitled to some order of deference along 11 the lines of "our." And all -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there is no 13 difference between what the Commissioner says the 14 regulation means and what it says. 15 MS. O'CONNELL: That's true. Well -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't seem to 17 move the ball much, one way or the other. 18 MS. O'CONNELL: That's true, unless you 19 accept Petitioner's argument, that what the regulation 20 means when it says you evaluate the tax based on its 21 predominant character is that that means you can rewrite 22 the tax before you start testing it against the three 23 regulatory requirements, and, in which case, this would 24 be a 51.75 percent tax on four years of profits that you 25 are testing against the three regulatory requirements.
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 In which case, yes, it would probably be an 2 income tax, but that's not how the Commissioner views 3 the regulation. The Commissioner views that predominant 4 character test as, so long as the tax is predominantly 5 one where you -- it is on realized income and is 6 calculated by starting with gross receipts and 7 subtracting out costs and expenses, there can be minor, 8 nonconforming elements in the tax base -- like the 9 inclusion of imputed rental income that is not actually 10 earned by a taxpayer, which some countries include in an 11 income tax, and the tax could still be creditable. 12 The predominant character does not mean -13 the predominant character test does not mean that you 14 completely rewrite the statutory tax base before you 15 test it against those three regulatory requirements. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you -- go 17 ahead. 18 What if they impose this -- what you would 19 call valuation tax every year, and it was based the same 20 way, it's based on profits that year, saying, we're 21 going to say, we think the value of this company is now 22 this much because they made -- whatever -- $20 million 23 last year. And so we impose this -- this set tax. 24 The next year, we think its value is this 25 because they made -- you know, 10 million, so we are
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 going to impose this tax. 2 MS. O'CONNELL: I think that would not be an 3 income tax because they are using a valuation formula 4 that is imputing a value on the company and then 5 taxing that value. It's like a -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Based solely -7 based solely on the amount of income? 8 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, if that -- if that 9 were the only characteristic, then I think a property 10 tax that is calculated that way could become an income 11 tax, and that's not what the income tax credit -- the 12 foreign tax credit is designed to do. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How could -- a 14 property tax calculated that way? In other words, based 15 on income from the property? 16 MS. O'CONNELL: Times a price-to-earnings 17 ratio. If -- if what you are saying is that the -- the 18 tax that the foreign government is imposing is just a 19 tax based on last year's income, and they are calling it 20 a property tax or something like that, I think that is 21 what Petitioner was giving as an example. 22 That, I'm -- I think, I think would be an 23 income tax. If the only variable in the tax base was 24 profits, yes. If they -25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if they said, we
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 are going to multiply it by a price/earnings ratio. 2 MS. O'CONNELL: Yes. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Based on how much 4 you earned. 5 MS. O'CONNELL: Yes. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which sounds like 7 income. 8 MS. O'CONNELL: No, that sounds like value. 9 And I -- and that's another thing that -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the "how much 11 you earned" part sounds like income. 12 MS. O'CONNELL: Yes, but -- but any 13 valuation formula will use some known data from the 14 company to determine the company's value. So, if you 15 are -- if you just -- if you are applying just to a 16 company -- say that the United States was imposing a 17 property tax on corporations and it decided to calculate 18 the value of the corporation by taking its last year's 19 earnings times the price-to-earnings ratio, that could 20 be reformulated to look like a tax on the company's -21 JUSTICE BREYER: If the reformulation -22 think of -- think that first term. Put it in your mind. 23 Now, that first term does have a number -- .23 -- and 24 let's do times 9, which is that valuation business. And 25 what you get is a little over 2. Okay?
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 And you are going to get that every time. 2 That's not going to vary from company-to-company. That 3 varies as long as the universe is here. So we know 4 we're going to multiply .2 -- rather, 2 point something 5 times that first part of the first term. 6 And that first part of the first term 7 consists of nothing other than, for the four-year 8 company, the average one-year profit. So the only -9 what you are telling people to do in that first term is 10 simply multiply by a little over than 2 -- a little more 11 than 2 -- the average profit earned over a four-year 12 period. That's what it says. 13 So there is nothing there but income. It's 14 average income, I grant you. But there is nothing there 15 but income. And then what you subtract from that -16 what you subtract from that is a quarter -- is a quarter 17 of the value, I grant you. But it's a hypothetical 18 value used with the number 9 of what one-quarter of the 19 value of the floatation price taken in. 20 So there's an aspect to it that does have -21 unless you do it the way I was doing it initially -22 there is an aspect to it that does concern at least a 23 hypothetical value. But the heart of the equation, in 24 determining this so-called present value, is nothing 25 other than taking average income over the four-year

1 period. 2 Now, if I'm right -- am I right about that? 3 MS. O'CONNELL: No. If you're -4 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 5 MS. O'CONNELL: First of all, if the first 6 part of the equation is -- is profits multiplied by 2, 7 then -- then no. That -- that is not -8 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. It is -- the very 9 first part of the first part is the profits -- the 10 average profit over the four-year period. It says P. 11 And then P, with all of this day business, that's just 12 times 365 because they want to annualize it. 13 So, if you have a four years, what you are 14 going to have is you -- you will have 365 times -- and 15 then it's going to wipe out, and you will have divided 16 by 4. So you will take the total profit over the 17 four-year period, and you'll divide it by 4. That gives 18 you the annual profit. So, now, we have finished the 19 first half of the first part. 20 And the second half -- and we are going to 21 take .23 of that. Okay? 22 No, we are not going to take any yet. 23 Taking .23 -- you're going to take .23 of the number 9, 24 and that leaves you with the 2 -- that brings you to the 25 little over 2.2.

1 MS. O'CONNELL: If you -2 JUSTICE BREYER: So what we are doing is 3 taking the average annual profit over a four-year 4 period, we average it, and then we multiply it by two 5 point something. Okay? And what that is doing -- and 6 then what that is doing is giving you just the average 7 annual, two years' worth of average annual. 8 And, from that, we subtract a quarter of 9 what they received in the initial price, which happens 10 to be what the market -- if it really was 9 -- about 11 was expecting it to earn during a two-year 12 period. That's why I put in the last part. 13 But even if I am wrong about that, I am 14 right about the first half, aren't I. 15 MS. O'CONNELL: Well -- and I think what you 16 are -- the one point of this that is missing is that, if 17 you are going to multiply the other part by 2, you also 18 have to multiply the tax rate by 2. And if this is -19 JUSTICE BREYER: That's why I said 20 50 percent. 21 MS. O'CONNELL: No, no. It would be -- it 22 would be 100-and-some percent. It would be twice the 23 51 point -24 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes, yes. That rate 25 could be a problem for somebody at some time, in some

1 place. 2 MS. O'CONNELL: It would be -3 JUSTICE BREYER: It wasn't a problem here 4 because all of these companies, but one, did have and 5 did fit within the four-year category. So as to all 6 these companies, but one, it did not exceed gross 7 income; it did not exceed net income; it was 50 -- what 8 the number that he arrived at. 9 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, Justice Breyer, in 10 your -- in your reconstructed formula, the tax rate is 11 going to be twice the 51.75 percent. And that's -12 JUSTICE BREYER: It is? 13 MS. O'CONNELL: Yes, because you have -- if 14 you're dividing -15 JUSTICE BREYER: Of the one year, you 16 haven't calculated based on one year, but it's 50 percent of 17 two years, isn't it? 18 I'm sorry. I am now confused enough that 19 I am not following you. 20 MS. O'CONNELL: It's 50 percent for all four 21 years. For one year, it's 207 percent. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 23 MS. O'CONNELL: It's 51.75 percent for all 24 years. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. I have said

1 enough -- my law clerks will have picked this up. They 2 will have written it down, and I will be able to go 3 back with the transcript and study it, which I will do. 4 (Laughter.) 5 MS. O'CONNELL: And, Justice Breyer, I 6 just -- I want to address for a minute this -- this 7 issue that it wasn't confiscatory of any particular 8 taxpayer's net gain. That's not the relevant question, 9 and I know there's some discussion about this in the 10 briefs. 11 But, if all you were to do were to compare 12 the final tax bill to the company's net profits over the 13 year, there's a lot of things that are not income taxes 14 that would then become income taxes, like an excise tax 15 that is charged on the number -- or the -- the number of 16 products that are manufactured or sold in a particular 17 company in any given year, so long as there -- as it 18 leaves the taxpayer with a nickel, then it's -- then 19 that's an income tax. 20 That's not what the income tax means. What 21 matters is what the tax base is. That's how you 22 determine if it's a tax on income. The realization test 23 requires that because you can't impose a tax on income 24 that the -- the taxpayer hasn't actually realized. And 25 the gross receipts and the net income tax also require

1 it. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. O'Connell -- if the 3 Court should go the way the Fifth Circuit went -- the 4 way the Tax Court went -- could the regulation be 5 changed so it wouldn't happen again? 6 MS. O'CONNELL: If so, then I -- I think it 7 should be changed. And I don't know exactly how that 8 would look, but maybe it could make it more clear that 9 you're supposed to just look at the tax base -- I think 10 the regulation does say that. 11 But, yes, I think there would be room for -12 for the IRS to -- to make the regulation even more clear 13 than it already is, if this Court were to conclude that 14 the windfall tax is an income tax. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Why -- why should it be 16 changed? I mean, why should companies -- American 17 companies doing business abroad, in borderline cases, 18 have to pay tax on the same income twice? 19 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, Justice Breyer, 20 they're -- they're not. SWEB, the subsidiary of 21 Petitioner, paid the British income tax in the same 22 years that it paid this windfall tax, in 1997 and 1998. 23 And Petitioner got a dollar-for-dollar foreign tax 24 credit for its portion of that British income tax that 25 was paid in those years.

1 For any other tax that's imposed by a 2 foreign government that's not the income tax or that's 3 not an Excess Profits Tax or a war profits tax, the 4 company can get a tax deduction. That's how profits -5 or other taxes are normally treated. 6 You deduct from the amount of income that 7 you are reporting to the IRS, the dollars that you paid 8 toward that foreign tax, and the -- the value of that 9 deduction depends on the marginal tax rate that the 10 taxpayer is paying. 11 So you might get 35 cents on the dollar for 12 every dollar that you can subtract from your income tax 13 base. But the dollar-for-dollar credit in Section 901 14 is reserved for foreign taxes that have the equivalent 15 features of the U.S. income tax, and the windfall tax 16 simply doesn't. 17 It's written as a valuation formula, and 18 it's not just written that way, but that's the substance 19 of what it's trying to do. It's imputing a value on 20 each company for what the U.K. government should have 21 charged, and it's subtracting out the amount of money 22 that it actually received. 23 And I think that's an important point to 24 keep in mind when determining what is the -- the 25 substance of this tax, is that the U.K. government is not
52

Alderson Reporting Company

1 just going out into the world and taxing companies that 2 it thinks are particularly profitable, to try to get 3 more money. 4 The U.K. government used to own these 5 companies, and it sold them at too low a price, and the 6 windfall tax is an effort to get back some of that value 7 that it should have asked for when it sold them. 8 Whether that's a good idea or a bad idea, 9 it's not an income tax, in the U.S. sense, and it should 10 not be entitled to a credit under Section 901. 11 Thank you. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 13 Mr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining. 14 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 15 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 16 MR. CLEMENT: Thank you. Just a few quick 17 points in rebuttal. 18 First of all, just for the record, if what 19 they really wanted to do in the British government was 20 to tax value, as we normally understood it, there was a 21 ready mechanism available, the London Stock Exchange 22 price. 23 Now they want to say, well, but we wanted to 24 go back and value it in 1990, but, as alluded to, they 25 could have done that because, on day one, there was
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 about a 20 percent pop -- that's -- to use the IPO 2 word -- there's about a 20 percent pop in value at the 3 end of the first day's trading. They could have taxed 4 that. 5 If they wanted to be a little less precise, 6 but capture a little more value, they could have gone 7 30 days out or 60 days out, on the theory that it took a 8 while for the information to make it in to the market. 9 That would have been a value tax. I wouldn't be up here 10 arguing that it's creditable. 11 But what they did was something very 12 different. They used a sui generis, very unique concept 13 of value, not value unmodified, but value in 14 profit-making terms. And not profit-making terms in 15 some abstract sense that takes into account future 16 income streams, but profit-making terms, as measured by 17 4 years of reported profits that satisfy every test of 18 the regulation. 19 They're realized profits, they're based on 20 gross receipts, and they reflect exactly to the penny -21 to the pence, the net income. That's what they base 22 this tax on. 23 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, what do you 24 think would -- is the answer -- suppose that the Labour 25 government had come in -- not after 4 years but after 2
54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 years -- that they had looked at those 2 years of profits, 2 they said, that's enough for us, to know that these 3 companies were grossly undervalued, and they had done 4 this exact same formula, and the result is that they 5 would have ended up with a tax rate of over 100 percent. 6 Would that have been creditable or not? 7 MR. CLEMENT: I would be here with a more 8 difficult case, Justice Kagan. I would love to argue 9 that that is still creditable because I think you could 10 live in a country that has an income tax, especially an 11 Excess Profits Tax on a few disfavored industries, that 12 has a rate over 100 percent. 13 But I would run into a regulatory hurdle, 14 and, if I had had that case, I would have had to 15 challenge the regulations. I would have loved to do it. 16 JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess what the 17 hypothetical suggests is that, in some respects, the 18 fact that you now -- that you have a tax rate here of 19 between 0 and 1 is a bit of a fluke -- you know, if they 20 had come in a little bit earlier and done the exact same 21 thing, based on their understanding of how profitable 22 these companies were, which they would have seen after 2 23 years, you wouldn't have been able to make the same 24 argument. 25 MR. CLEMENT: Can I just say, though, it
55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 wouldn't have been a fluke because one of the things 2 that the people that constructed this tax wanted out of 3 this tax is they wanted it paid. 4 So it's not a fluke that they didn't impose 5 a huge tax in excess of initial period profits on any 6 company because they wanted to make sure the incidents 7 of this tax was on companies that could actually pay it. 8 And, if you do that based on 4 years' of reported 9 profits, you're pretty sure that people are going to be 10 able to pay it. 11 I would like to bring back to the -- the 12 concession, I think, that ultimately was made by the 13 government, that, if a foreign government has a tax on 14 value, that the only measure of value is the past years' 15 reported income, that that would be a creditable income 16 tax. Well, I don't think it changes if you multiply it 17 by 9. I don't think it changes if you divide it by 4. 18 I don't think if there is one company, that 19 you divide it by 1/4, instead of 4 -- any of that 20 changes the analysis, nor does it change the analysis if 21 you subtract out some figure that represents a market 22 cap or initial floatation value. 23 That would make it an Excess Profits Tax, 24 rather than a simple income tax, and that is what the 25 British government did.

1 I'll just close by bringing you back 2 75 years to the Biddle case. In the Biddle case, there 3 was an argument about a British tax and whether we 4 should follow the form of the tax or the substance of 5 this tax. 6 This Court said that we, of course, in 7 looking at a foreign tax, don't bind ourselves by 8 foreign classifications or characterizations. We look 9 to the substance of the tax. 10 In the Biddle case, the rule that you look 11 to substance, not form, benefited the Commissioner. 12 There's no reason for a different rule when the shoe is 13 on the other foot. 14 Thank you. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 16 Counsel. 17 The case is submitted. 18 (Whereupon, at 12:14 p.m., the case in the 19 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 20 21 22 23 24 25
