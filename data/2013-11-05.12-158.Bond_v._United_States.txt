1  P R O C E E D I N G S  2  (10:05 a.m.)  3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear  4 argument first this morning in Case 12158,  5 Bond v. United States.  6  Mr. Clement?  7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT  8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER  9  MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it  10 please the Court:  11  If the statute at issue here really does  12 reach every malicious use of chemicals anywhere in the  13 nation, as the government insists, then it clearly  14 exceeds Congress' limited and enumerated powers.  This  15 Court's cases have made clear that it is a bedrock  16 principle of our federalist system that Congress lacks a  17 general police power to criminalize conduct without  18 regard to a jurisdictional element or some nexus to a  19 matter of distinctly Federal concern.  20  The President's negotiation and the Senate's  21 ratification of a treaty with a foreign nation does not  22 change that bedrock principle of our constitutional  23 system.  24  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But, Mr. Clement, you  25 said that  that the treaty is valid and the
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 implementing legislation seems to largely copy the words  2 of the treaty without adding anything.  So it's a puzzle  3 that the treaty could be constitutional, but the  4 implementing legislation that adds nothing is  5 unconstitutional.  6  MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I  7 guess I would quarrel with your premise, which is, it is  8 true that the convention in the statute used similar  9 terms and terminology, but there's one very important  10 difference between the convention and the statute, and  11 that actually differentiates this case from Missouri v.  12 Holland.  13  And that difference is that the convention  14 itself doesn't directly regulate individual conduct at  15 all.  And so all the  all the convention does  16  JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the convention  but  17 the convention tells the State parties, go regulate  18 individual conduct in exactly the way that this  19 convention regulates State parties.  And then what the  20 legislation does is, as Justice Ginsburg said, just  21 mirror the convention as the convention contemplated.  22  MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kagan, to be  23 quite precise, though, what the convention says  and  24 this is Article 7, Section 1, it's 33a of the Blue Brief  25 appendix.  What it says is that each nation state that
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 signs the convention agrees, in accordance with its  2 constitutional processes, to pass penal laws that make  3 unlawful for individuals conduct that would violate the  4 convention, if undertaken by a nation state.  5  And I would respectfully suggest that making  6 that translation, if you will, between what violates the  7 convention if you're a nation state and what would be  8 comparable individual conduct is not obvious.  And when  9 the government does that through penal legislation,  10 there's no reason why that penal legislation shouldn't  11 have to comply  12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why not?  13  MR. CLEMENT:   as we promised with our  14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Clement, why not?  15 Meaning there  there can be no doubt that chemical  16 weaponry is at the forefront of our foreign policy  17 efforts right now.  Look at the Syria situation alone.  18 It would be deeply ironic that we have expended so much  19 energy criticizing Syria, when if this Court were now to  20 declare that our joining or creating legislation to  21 implement the treaty was unconstitutional.  We're  22 putting aside the impact that we could have on foreign  23 relations.  24  Why is it  if it's okay to regulate the  25 possession of marijuana, a purely local crime, why is it
5

Alderson Reporting Company

1 unconstitutional to regulate the use of something that  2 can kill or maim another human being  a chemical that  3 can kill or maim another human being?  4  MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think  5  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't understand where  6 the disconnect is in terms of our Federal or State  7 system.  8  MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, I  9 think it really gets down to the difference between  10 Raich on the one hand and Lopez on the other, which, as  11 this Court has held, that it is a classic and rational  12 way to regulate commerce, to basically prohibit certain  13 items from commerce.  And  14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why isn't this  15 saying  there's no dispute that these chemicals were  16 transported against  along interstate lines.  That's  17 not even disputed in this case.  18  MR. CLEMENT:  Well  but I don't think it  19 was really disputed in Lopez that the firearm would have  20 had to cross State lines.  But the problem in Lopez was  21 the Federal statute was not structured in a way that had  22 a jurisdictional nexus that made the statute only  23 applicable as a regulation.  24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now  25  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, we didn't take this

1 case to  to decide the Commerce Clause question, did  2 we?  The government didn't even assert it below.  It  3 asserts it now, but as we took the case, the issue was  4 whether the treaty supported the  the laws.  5  MR. CLEMENT:  That's right, Justice Scalia.  6 And we do think that the government, like a private  7 party, can waive a constitutional argument.  8  On the other hand, I would say that we're  9 not particularly concerned about the Commerce Clause  10 argument because we think the Commerce Clause argument  11 has the same basic defect as the treaty power argument,  12 which is that the police  13  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think  do you  14 think, Mr. Clement, and this goes back to Justice  15 Ginsburg's question, could the  could this treaty have  16 itself regulated individual conduct?  Could the treaty  17 have been selfexecuting?  18  MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think that's an  19 interesting question, and I don't think the Court needs  20 to answer it.  I mean, I would take the position that if  21 there really were a selfexecuting treaty that tried to  22 impose criminal prohibitions, and I don't think there is  23 any treaty like that, but if there were one, I would  24 say, here, that it violates the Constitution for the  25 same basic reasons that this implementing legislation
7

1 does.  But I  but I  2  JUSTICE KAGAN:  So where would you find that  3 in the Constitution?  Because there's clearly a treaty  4 power that does not have subject matter limitations.  5 And, indeed, if you go back to the founding history,  6 it's very clear that they thought about all kinds of  7 subject matter limitations, and James Madison and others  8 decided, quite selfconsciously, not to impose them.  9  So where would you find that limitation in  10 the Constitution.  11  MR. CLEMENT:  I would find that limitation  12 in the structural provisions of the Constitution and the  13 enumerated powers of Congress.  And I would say that it  14 would be very  15  JUSTICE KAGAN:  But this is an enumerated  16 power.  The enumerated power is the treaty power.  So  17 you have to find a constraint on the treaty power.  18 Where does it come from?  19  MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think  that where it  20 would come from, again, is the structural provisions of  21 the Constitution.  If we had a selfexecuting treaty  22 that purported, at a national level, to commandeer State  23 and local police officers, I would think that there  24 might be  you could call it a Tenth Amendment  25 objection, you could call it an enumerated power
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 objection.  There might be an objection to that treaty.  2  JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, don't you think the  3 word "treaty" has some meaning?  It is certainly true  4 that, going back to the beginning of the country, there  5 have been many treaties that have been implemented in  6 ways that affect matters that otherwise would be within  7 the province of the States.  8  One of the original purposes of the 9 objectives of the Constitution was to deal with  with  10 a treaty power was to deal with the issue of debts owed  11 to British creditors.  And there have been cases about  12 the property rights of  of foreign subjects, about the  13 treatment of foreign subjects here, about things that  14 are moving across international borders, about  15 extradition and all of those.  16  But in all of those, until fairly recently,  17 certainly until, generally, after World War II, all of  18 those concerned matters that are of legitimate concern  19 of a foreign State.  That was the purpose of a treaty.  20 So can't we see something in that, in the meaning of a  21 treaty, what it was understood to mean when the  22 Constitution was adopted?  23  MR. CLEMENT:  I think that's right,  24 Justice Alito.  And I didn't mean, in answering Justice  25 Kagan's question, to fully accept the premise that
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 there's no limit on the treaty power whatsoever.  But I  2 do think that it's important to recognize that, in the  3 context of nonselfexecuting treaties, there's a real  4 opportunity to leave for another day the question of  5 whether the treaty itself is valid because, sometimes, a  6 treaty is nonselfexecuting precisely because the  7 Senate recognizes  8  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If you had been the  9 President's counsel, would you have advised him that it  10 was unconstitutional to sign this treaty as written?  11  MR. CLEMENT:  No.  Absolutely not,  12 Justice Kennedy, but that's precisely because it's a  13 valid nonselfexecuting treaty.  By its terms, it  14 doesn't do anything to direct  directly regulate  15 individual conduct.  And if I were the President's  16 counsel, I would have said, honestly, Mr. President, I  17 don't think this requires us to have any law that  18 applies to garden variety assaults with chemicals.  19  But if we need that to discharge our treaty  20 obligations, the States are absolutely ready and able to  21 shoulder that task.  There's no State in this country  22 that doesn't have a general assault statute that would  23 be covered by this conduct.  There is no State that  24 doesn't have a murder statute to cover this conduct  25  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Clement, there's an
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 irony in what you just said, because the victim, many  2 times, went to the State police and said, please help  3 me.  And they turned her away a dozen times.  And  4 finally they said, go to the post office.  5  So this doesn't seem to be  you're arguing  6 that this trenches on the State's domain.  And, yet, in  7 this very case, it wasn't until the State referred her  8 to the post office, Federal officials, that she got any  9 action.  10  MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, one  11 way to understand that is that the State of Pennsylvania  12 exercised its prosecutorial discretion not to pursue  13 this matter.  I don't think that  I don't even think  14 the government says that that exercise of prosecutorial  15 discretion put us in violation of our treaty  16 obligations.  17  Our treaty obligation, at most, is to have a  18 law that prohibits this conduct, which the States  19 certainly do.  The treaty obligation is not to make sure  20 that every single use  malicious use of chemicals is,  21 in fact, prosecuted by the State or local officials.  22  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Clement, could I make  23 sure I understand your test?  Your test is to say that  24 with respect to every prosecution under this  under  25 this treaty, that a court has to ask whether the
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 prosecution has a sufficient nexus to national or  2 international concerns?  Is that  is that your test?  3  MR. CLEMENT:  No, that's not my test,  4 Justice Kagan.  I would actually come at it from the  5 other end of the stick, which is to say, that the one  6 thing I think I know from this Court's precedence is  7 that the Federal government doesn't have a general  8 police power.  9  So as I look at this statute, it can either  10 be saved by essentially creating a jurisdictional  11 element out of the phrase "peaceful" and equating it  12 with nonwarlike or, if the statute really has this  13 general character, then at least as applied to the  14 chemicals here, which are pure dual use chemicals, it  15 can't be constitutionally applied.  16  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I guess I'm still  17 looking for a test, and I thought that the test that I  18 just articulated was really directly out of your briefs.  19 But if it's  if  if you're suggesting that  20 that's not the test, give me the test that we're  21 supposed to ask with respect to this case or any other  22 as to whether the prosecution is unconstitutional.  23  MR. CLEMENT:  It's whether the Federal  24 statute exercises a general police power.  And if it  25 does 
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  JUSTICE KAGAN:  That sounds like a facial  2 challenge.  Now, I thought that you made very careful to  3 talk about that this was an asapplied challenge to this  4 particular prosecution.  5  MR. CLEMENT:  Well, that's because the only  6 relief I'm seeking is to have my client's conviction  7 vacated, so this is the classic asapplied challenge.  8 Now, the reasoning that the Court may employ in  9 vindicating my asapplied challenge may suggest that the  10 statute is unconstitutional in some or all of different  11 applications, but our claim has always been that  12 the  13  JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you're saying, if the  14 statute extends to things that we've generally thought  15 of as part of the police power, that's sufficient.  16  MR. CLEMENT:  I would say that, if a Federal  17 statute exercises the police power  by which I mean it  18 criminalizes conduct without regard to jurisdictional  19 element or some nexus to a matter of distinctly Federal  20 concern, then that statute exceeds Congress' power.  21 That was the case in Lopez; that was the case in  22 Morrison.  And I think, unless you accept our narrowing  23 construction, that's the case here.  24  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  Nexus  nexus to a  25 national concern, again, is what I understood you to say
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 in your brief.  But let me give you a hypothetical, and  2 you tell me whether your test meets it.  3  Let's say it's the same convention, except  4 it relates only to Sarin gas, and  and there's a  5 chemist out there and  you know, the  the  6 implementing legislation mirrors the convention.  7 There's a chemist out there who manufactures Sarin  8 gas  I take it it's pretty easy to manufacture  and  9 sends it through the ducts of a house and kills  10 everybody in it.  11  Does that have a nexus to national concerns?  12  MR. CLEMENT:  It does, Your Honor, and it  13 would be valid legislation precisely because Sarin is  14 something that, clearly, Congress could prohibit in all  15 its uses.  And as I understand how this statute applies  16 to Sarin gas or other things, certainly, on Schedule  17 I  there are some Schedule I substances that are  18 talked about both in the convention and the treaty  19 those things are always unlawful.  20  What is particularly unusual about the  21 statute's application to something like potassium  22 dichromate or vinegar or whatever you have is that, in  23 most of its possession and uses, it's perfectly lawful,  24 and what makes it a chemical weapon in the government's  25 theory is when it's used purely intrastate in a
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 malicious way.  2  JUSTICE KAGAN:  So  but this is  in my  3 hypothetical  and you didn't run away from it at all;  4 I applaud that.  In my hypothetical, it's a completely  5 domestic use  you know, it's just this chemist didn't  6 like his neighbor and used Sarin gas.  And you're saying  7 that the difference is, well, what the treaty makers did  8 was define the category of chemicals more broadly.  9  And I guess what I want to know is you are  10 imagining a world in which judges day to day try to get  11 inside the head of treaty makers to think about  you  12 know, in this case, we understand that there's a  13 national interest in regulating Sarin gas, but we don't  14 think that there's a sufficient national interest in regulating  15 some other chemical or some other chemical or so on down  16 the line.  17  It seems to me a completely indeterminate  18 test and one that would have judges take the place of  19 treaty makers, in terms of deciding what is in the  20 national and international interest.  21  MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kagan, I would  22 beg to differ.  I actually think that our approach to  23 this case avoids judges being put in that difficult  24 position, precisely because we distinguish, unlike the  25 government, between the validity of the convention and
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the validity of the implementing legislation.  2  And then, as to the implementing  3 legislation, we simply ask the courts to do what they do  4 in every other context, which is to check and see if  5 that implementing legislation is consistent with our  6 basic chartering document.  7  And it's the government's position, which I  8 don't really understand why this would work, but their  9 theory is that, if the nonselfexecuting treaty is  10 valid, then the implementing legislation is ipso facto  11 somehow valid.  12  JUSTICE ALITO:  And do you think it would be  13 difficult  14  MR. CLEMENT:  And think about the convention  15 that was before this Court in the Medellin case, the  16 Vienna Convention on Consular Notification.  It puts an  17 obligation on any arresting official to provide  18 notification to the consulate about an arrested foreign  19 national.  20  Now, I suppose it would be a perfectly  21 rational way to implement that convention to have a  22 national police force, and so every arresting officer is  23 a Federal officer who's fully apprised of the Vienna  24 Convention responsibilities.  That would be a rational  25 way to implement the treaty, but it wouldn't be remotely
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 consistent with our Constitution.  2  On the other hand, that same valid  3 nonselfexecuting treaty can be validly implemented by  4 chartering the State Department to work with police  5 officers on a State and local level to understand their  6 obligations.  7  JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think it would be  8 difficult for a judge to ask, is there any possibility  9 that there is any other country in the world that has  10 the slightest interest in how the United States or any  11 of its subdivisions deals with the particular situation  12 that's involved in this case?  13  MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Alito, I think that  14 would be one way of approaching the question.  I think  15 that would be a  16  JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that would be  17 beyond the  that would be beyond the ability of  18 Federal judges when they  when a case like this comes  19 before them?  20  MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think it would be  21 beyond their ability.  I also don't think it would be  22 beyond  beyond the ability of a Federal judge to say,  23 okay, let's hypothetically ask the question in the  24 absence of a nonselfexecuting treaty, would Congress  25 have the power to pass this statute?
17

Alderson Reporting Company

1  And if the answer to that is no, then I  2 think the burden sort of shifts to figure out why it is  3 that the treaty adds something to the powers of the  4 Federal government.  5  And I think this, just to make clear, I  6 think this is a very different context from what the  7 Court had in Missouri v. Holland because, there, the  8 treaty itself prohibited individual action.  An  9 individual violated the treaty if they took a migratory  10 bird out of season.  11  And so in that sense, the enforcement  12 statute did nothing more than put a criminal penalty on  13 violating conduct that was already prohibited to the  14 individual.  And in that  15  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it  is it one way to  16 characterize your argument or is it too unfairly  17 confining to your argument to say that what you're  18 suggesting is something like a clear statement rule,  19 that, if the treaty intends nation states to have their  20 own constitutional structure superseded at a minimum, it  21 has to say so, and then we will come to the question of  22 whether or not they can do it?  23  MR. CLEMENT:  I think that would be a fair  24 characterization of our argument, but only to add that  25 this would be the anticlear statement case.  Because
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the one place that this convention talks about imposing  2 obligations on individuals, it's a promise by the nation  3 state to pass penal legislation that is in accordance  4 with their constitutional systems.  5  So it's very bizarre  that's Article VII,  6 Section 1, it's, I think, 33a.  And so it's very bizarre  7 when the only way we're reaching individual conduct  8 here, unlike the treaty in Holland, is a United States  9 promise to pass legislation that comports with our  10 constitutional process, to say that the convention,  11 therefore, allow us to pass legislation that doesn't  12 comport with our constitutional process.  13  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Clement, I  I don't  14 understand how  how you distinguish Sarin gas.  Why is  15 Sarin gas different from vinegar?  16  MR. CLEMENT:  Because Sarin gas is, I think,  17 more equivalent to something that the Congress would try  18 to deal with like the way it dealt with marijuana in  19 Raich.  I think  it's just a reflection of the idea  20 that, when you're talking about things where the Federal  21 Government is trying to prohibit it, then there's a  22 greater Federal power to do that.  23  And I think, with Sarin gas, you could  24 imagine  put aside the commerce power for a second,  25 put aside the treaty power  it may be that, with Sarin
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 gas, even under the war powers, the Federal Congress can  2 say, look, that's something that's  you know, it's  3 sort of inherently a chemical weapon, and we're going to  4 prohibit people from having that.  5  That's very different from these situations  6 where, if you think about it, the only thing that makes  7 these chemicals chemical weapons instead of chemicals is  8 their internal, intrastate use in a malicious way.  And  9 that's different, I think, from at least a hypothetical  10 statute that says, look, here are  I mean, there's  11 three schedules in the statute, 43 different chemicals  12 that are particularly problematic.  13  If the Federal government wants to regulate  14 those and prohibit the unauthorized possession of those,  15 I don't see why they couldn't do that with or without  16 the treaty.  But when  what is so anomalous here is  17 the idea that these chemicals, everything, rat poison,  18 vinegar, whatever it is, these things are perfectly  19 lawful, we don't think of them as chemical weapons,  20 unless and until they're used in a malicious way, and  21 then all of a sudden, they become classified as chemical  22 weapons.  23  That's a very odd statute.  But it does, I  24 think, operate in a way that is just inconsistent with  25 the bedrock principle that the Federal Congress just
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 doesn't have this kind of police power.  2  JUSTICE BREYER:  Is the chemical used here  3 one of the chemicals that's listed in the annex to the  4 treaty?  5  MR. CLEMENT:  I don't believe so.  It's  6 certainly not one that is listed on the three schedules.  7 There are 43 chemicals.  Neither of these are on there.  8 And I do think there is an important difference  9 because  this is perhaps an odd way to think about it,  10 but  you know, this is a statute that's really trying  11 to regulate nouns, chemical weapons.  And with respect  12 to something like weaponized chemicals or Sarin gas, it  13 makes sense to say those are chemical weapons.  14  But with respect to otherwise harmless  15 chemicals, the only thing that under the government's  16 theory turns them from chemical weapons  I'm sorry  17 from chemicals into chemical weapons isn't a noun, it's  18 a verb.  It's their malicious use.  And that puts you in  19 a very odd sort of situation.  20  And I think that  you know, if Congress  21 had come in and said, look, there are certain chemicals  22 that, by their very nature, are almost inherently  23 weaponized, I think Congress would have a lot more  24 authority to proceed in that kind of situation.  25  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel  counsel, we
21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 permit that in all sorts of definitional sections of the  2 criminal code.  We call a dangerous weapon anything that  3 you use to inflict serious injury on someone.  I don't  4 think of a car as, necessarily, a dangerous weapon.  It  5 is something I use to transport myself.  6  It's only when I'm using it for a prohibited  7 purpose that it turns itself into a dangerous weapon.  8  MR. CLEMENT:  Well  9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So I'm  I'm having a  10 problem with this nounverb distinction.  Why isn't the  11 intentional burning, killing of another human being  12 using chemicals the essence of what this treaty is  13 trying to stop?  I thought that's what it was trying to  14 do.  15  MR. CLEMENT:  A couple points  16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You want to add on the  17 warlike purposes, but the  the treaty permits  18 exceptions for any peaceful purpose.  19  MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Sotomayor, a couple of  20 points.  First of all, generally, you might be right  21 that  that the criminal law takes objects that are  22 otherwise innocent and say  say they can be used in a  23 malicious way and criminalizes it.  24  But most of that work is done by State and  25 local criminal law, and at the Federal level, you need
22

1 something else.  You need a jurisdictional element,  2 something that has a distinct Federal concern.  3  Second, as to the concerns about this  4 convention  5  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The treaty power.  6  MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I don't think that the  7 treaty power  8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what was said in  9 the  10  MR. CLEMENT:   especially when there's  11 this much of a disconnect between what the treaty power  12 does and what the statute does, which is the treaty,  13 again, does not directly regulate at all individual  14 conduct.  It is regulated at nation state conduct.  15  Now, with all due respect, I don't think  16 that nation states poison romantic rivals, attempt to  17 commit suicide, or try to get rodents out of their  18 houses.  And so, when individuals do those things, I  19 think it's  it's hard to draw an analogy between  20 what's forbidden to a nation state and the individual  21 action.  22  But any work that is done in the statute by  23 drawing that analogy is done by the statute and not by  24 the convention.  So I don't  25  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if a terrorist took
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 these chemicals and put it on every doorknob in Boston,  2 that wouldn't be regulated by this or  the very exact  3 same chemicals.  4  MR. CLEMENT:  Right.  And we would say that,  5 under our narrowing construction, that that's covered.  6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because it's warlike.  7  MR. CLEMENT:  Because it's a warlike use of  8 the chemicals.  9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Now, we  10 have  we have  11  MR. CLEMENT:  We would also point out for  12 the record that that same conduct would obviously be  13 covered directly by Federal statutes that target  14 terrorism directly.  So no matter how you decide that  15 case, whether you accept our narrowing  if you accept  16 our narrowing construction, that conduct will be covered  17 by two Federal statutes.  If you don't accept our  18 narrowing construction, but hold this statute  19 unconstitutional, then that conduct is still going to be  20 covered.  21  And I just think, when you are trying again  22 to think about what the convention is after, it is not  23 really after Ms. Bond's conduct.  I don't think any one  24 of our treaty partners said, oh, my goodness, there's  25 been a deployment of chemical weapons in Norristown,
24

Alderson Reporting Company

1 Pennsylvania; I sure hope the United States steps up to  2 its treaty obligations and prosecutes this horrible  3 deployment of chemical weapons.  4  Nobody would say that because nobody  5 speaking normal English would identify this as a  6 deployment of chemical weapons at all.  7  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but, Mr. Clement, it's  8 absolutely clear that the treaty was after enforcement  9 as to individuals with respect to all the prohibitions,  10 that the treaty said, go enforce this as to individuals  11 and do it consistent with your constitutional processes.  12  And then Congress passes a law that is  13 consistent with its constitutional processes, and it  14 completely mirrors the treaty.  15  MR. CLEMENT:  Two things, Justice Kagan,  16 neither of which will surprise you, I suppose.  One is I  17 don't think this is consistent with our constitutional  18 processes  19  JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I'm still trying to  20 figure out why.  I mean, Holmes dealt with this in  21 Missouri v. Holland.  He says there's a treaty power,  22 it's an enumerated power, there's a Necessary and Proper  23 Clause that functions to  to allow Congress to give  24 effect to that treaty power.  It's  you know, this is  25 a  a situation where there's a prohibition on the
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 States in terms of entering into treaties or in terms of  2 sharing that power in any way.  3  And he says  you know, it's just these  4 invisible radiations that you think come from the  5 structure of the Constitution.  And he specifically  6 rejected this argument, the same argument that you're  7 making, the penumbras and emanations of the  8 Constitution.  9  MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Kagan, I think you  10 have to read Missouri v. Holland both in the context of  11 the treaty that the Court had before it and the argument  12 that it had before it.  Missouri made a very strange  13 argument in Missouri v. Holland, one that no modern  14 litigant would make.  They made an argument that  they  15 went out of their way to identify a conflict between the  16 Federal treaty and State law and said, therefore, we win  17 under the Supremacy Clause.  18  And Holmes scratched his head and said no.  19 The treaty under  under Article 6 is supreme to both  20 State law and not the other way around.  But he also  21 said this one sentence that sort of bedeviled the lower  22 courts here, which says, well, and if the treaty's  23 valid, of course, the legislation is valid.  24  That made sense in the context of the treaty  25 he had before him because he had a treaty that directly
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 prohibited individual conduct and a statute that  2 enforced that individualized prohibition with criminal  3 penalties.  4  So in that case, I suppose it was right,  5 that the treaty and the implementing legislation stood  6 or fell together.  That's not the case here.  7  If I could reserve my time.  8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.  9  General Verrilli.  10  ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,  11  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT  12  GENERAL VERRILLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and  13 may it please the Court:  14  The framers gave the Federal Government  15 exclusive control over the treaty function to ensure  16 that it could knit the nation together as one and allow  17 it to be fully sovereign in the conduct of foreign  18 affairs.  19  Petitioner's ad hoc "too local" limit on the  20 treaty power can't be squared with a judgment the  21 framers made, this Court's precedent, or consistent  22 historical practice since the time of the founding, and  23 it would compromise foreign affairs and national  24 security interests of the first order.  25  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  General, let's
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 suppose there's a multilateral treaty, the  the  2 international convention to ensure that national  3 legislatures have full authority to carry out their  4 obligations, i.e., that the national legislature has the  5 police power.  6  And Congress passes a statute saying we have  7 the authority to prosecute purely local crimes pursuant  8 to this international convention that the President has  9 signed.  Any problem with that?  10  GENERAL VERRILLI:  There may well be.  Let  11 me walk through the analysis that I think you'd have to  12 go through.  First, I would make the point,  13 Mr. Chief Justice, that it seems unimaginable that a  14 convention of that kind would be ratified by twothirds  15 of the Senate, which it would have to be  16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why?  17  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It also seems  18 unimaginable that you would bring this prosecution.  But  19 let's leave that.  20  (Laughter.)  21  GENERAL VERRILLI:  And that does go to the  22 point  23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And just to press it  24 further, the  the point is that it's a transfer of  25 authority from the States to the national legislature.  26 I don't know why you'd look to the national legislature
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to say, well, we'd never do that.  2  GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, the framers thought  3 that the twothirds guarantee  the twothirds  4 ratification requirement, was an important structural  5 guarantee to protect the interests of the States.  6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  At a time when the  7 Senate was elected by the State legislatures.  8  GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  9 But there's no doubt that the framers thought that would  10 be an important protection.  11  But beyond that, this Court has said that  12 that there is an inquiry.  It said in dictum.  It has  13 never held that a ratified treaty exceeds  exceeds the  14 Federal government's constitutional authority.  It's  15 never held that a provision implementing a ratified  16 treaty exceeds the Federal government's constitutional  17 authority.  18  JUSTICE SCALIA:  So your answer is if  if  19 that unimaginable thing should happen, it would be okay?  20  GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  21  JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.  22  GENERAL VERRILLI:  My answer is this:  That  23 the Court has said that there is an inquiry into whether  24 the  it is a proper subject of a treaty and that that  25 inquiry could take into account whether it is imposing a
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 fundamental change in the character of the government.  2  But that's not a question the Court needs to  3 answer here because this treaty, the  the Petitioner  4 concedes, is a valid exercise of the treaty power, and  5 the legislation implementing this treaty is coextensive  6 with the obligations of the treaty.  There is no  7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I don't know  8 why it would not be a valid exercise of the treaty  9 power.  A case like Medellin caused serious conflict  10 with our international obligations because we held,  11 look, the Federal government does not have the authority  12 to tell the sheriff in Texas what to do.  That caused a  13 great deal of strain in  in our international  14 relations.  15  And I think the United Nations could well  16 say, look, we don't want treaty parties to have to deal  17 with whether it's somebody in this State or somebody in  18 that province who has the authority, so every signatory  19 must have the authority.  It doesn't strike me as not  20 reasonably related to international obligations.  21  GENERAL VERRILLI:  All right.  But  but  22 here, Mr. Chief Justice, this is a valid exercise of the  23 treaty power, and there is no daylight between the  24 implementing legislation and the obligations that the  25 Petitioner concedes are valid.

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  I know  2 your  I know the case  3  GENERAL VERRILLI:  And therefore  and  4 therefore, that may be a question that the Court would  5 have to answer in a different case.  But this case  6 doesn't present the opportunity to answer that question.  7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the  the  8 purpose of my hypothetical was try to find out if  9 there's any situation in which you believe an erosion or  10 intrusion by the Federal government on the police power  11 could be a constraint against an international treaty.  12  GENERAL VERRILLI:  There  there may be an  13 outer bound, but this case is nowhere close to it.  14 And  and it isn't  it can't be a "too local"  15 exception to the treaty power, which Petitioners argue.  16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it seems to me  17 that if you say there may be an outer bound, but this  18 case isn't one of them, you're subjecting yourself to  19 the same criticisms that have been leveled against the  20 other side, that you're proposing a casebycase  21 evaluation with respect to each treaty.  22  GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  I think, Your Honor,  23 that the question here is whether this legislation  24 validly  it validly implements a valid treaty.  25  The treaty is concededly valid.  The
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 legislation is concededly valid on its face.  2  JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'd like to  I'd like to  3 explore that, your proposition that there's no daylight  4 between the treaty itself and the implementing  5 legislation.  6  It seems to me there  there's a lot of  7 daylight between the two.  Let's take  and I pick this  8 example, not because it's controversial, but because it  9 relates to an area where the Federal government has  10 never been thought to have authority, namely family law.  11  There are no  you know, Federal marriage,  12 Federal divorce, Federal adoption.  It's all been State  13 law.  Let's assume that an international treaty is  14 approved by twothirds of the Senate and the president  15 which requires States to  to approve samesex  16 marriage.  All right?  17  Now, if  if that were a selfexecuting  18 treaty, samesex marriage would have to be approved by  19 every State.  If it is not selfexecuting, however, it  20 will be up to Congress to produce that result, and  21 Congress would do it or could do it at least by having a  22 Federal marriage law.  And then you would have to have a  23 Federal divorce law and, I suppose, a Federal adoption  24 law.  25  I think there is a big difference between
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 just doing it through a selfexecuting treaty and  2 dragging the Congress into  into areas where it has  3 never been before.  4  I think there is daylight between the treaty  5 and requiring the treaty to be implemented in the  6 fashion that  that you assert is necessary here.  7  GENERAL VERRILLI:  Your Honor, I'd like to  8 make a structural point and then a specific point about  9 this case.  The structural point, Justice Scalia, is  10 this:  If it is the case, as  as Your Honor's  11 hypothetical seems to concede and as I believe  12 Petitioner concedes, that a selfexecuting treaty that  13 requires the President to negotiate and twothirds of  14 the Senate to ratify it, can impose an obligation of  15 that kind, then it has to be the case that a  16 nonselfexecuting treaty that is  that has the same  17 approval of the President, the same twothirds  18 ratification, and the additional structural protection  19 of passage of legislation by the Senate and the House  20 and being signed into law by the President, can do what  21 the selfexecuting treaty can do.  It has to be the  22 case.  23  The power, if the  24  JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think it has to be  25 the case.  I think there  there's a great difference
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 between requiring the states, by a selfexecuting  2 treaty, to permit samesex marriage and dragging the  3 Federal government or allowing the Federal government to  4 enter into this whole field of marriage, divorce,  5 adoption, family law, where the Federal government has  6 never been.  7  GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, with respect  8 now, the point, with respect to this treaty, I don't  9 think that, with all due respect, there is any daylight  10 here with respect to this treaty.  11  Section 229(a) does precisely what the  12 treaty obligates the United States government to do, and  13 I think the notion that the treaty obligation can be  14 satisfied by relying on the States to enforce their  15 assault laws, which I think is the core of my friend's  16 argument here, is directly contrary to the history of  17 the framing  18  JUSTICE BREYER:  It is?  It is?  It is?  19 That's the part that I can't yet get my mind to these  20 dramatic questions of whether, here, the local police  21 power or, in some other case, some other inherently  22 State power make a treaty beyond the power of the  23 Federal government to enter into.  It's a very big  24 question.  25  But I'm not there yet.  And the reason I'm
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 not there is because there's some words in this treaty  2 called "other peaceful purpose," and we have to  3 interpret those words, and the same words are in the  4 statute.  5  And my question to you is:  What reason is  6 there to think that those matters on List A fall within  7 those words?  What is List A?  It's infinitely long.  A  8 few things on it are in Holmes' opinion in Peasley, a  9 great case on attempted murder where he talks about  10 paying a small boy to move a barrel of kerosene with a  11 candle in it alit, so that it will burn down a barn  12 after a few hours.  The kerosene is a chemical.  13  He talks about a case where a person went to  14 a racetrack and gave a horse a poison potato.  15  He talks about a case involving somebody  16 else trying to light a match, which is a chemical, and  17 setting fire to a haystack.  18  We can all think, sadly, of athletes, Lance  19 Armstrong, at least accused of unlawfully taking drugs.  20 I mean, why do we think matters of List A fall within  21 those words, outside the words "other peaceful purpose,"  22 even though they're unlawful?  23  And by the way, did anyone say to the  24 drafters of the convention  I found nothing in this  25 brief on the point  or did anyone tell Congress that
35

1 poison potatoes, drugenhancing  performanceenhancing  2 drugs, the example that Justice Alito used last time,  3 you give vinegar to a goldfish  I mean, these are all  4 chemicals not in the annex, but they are chemicals.  5  And they are absolutely nothing to do with  6 chemical weapons.  And why do we think that we have to  7 get beyond that fact?  8  GENERAL VERRILLI:  This is a very important  9 point here, and it gets, I think, to the heart of what  10 the national interest is in this case with respect to  11 this treaty and this implementing legislation.  And the  12 harm inheres in the process of line drawing.  13  What the Petitioner is asking as a rule of  14 either constitutional law or statutory construction is  15 that courts, on a casebycase basis, after the fact  16 make ad hoc judgments about whether they  17  JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  There's an easy  18 way out of that.  All we do is say the chemicals  19 involved are the chemicals in the annex.  But you're not  20 prepared to say that, I guarantee it.  21  GENERAL VERRILLI:  No  no, I'm not.  I  22  JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now, we're outside  23 the annex.  And I guess once we get outside the annex,  24 we either have to draw lines or we have to say, well,  25 this encompasses the poison potato, the poisoned

1 goldfish, the small boy with the candle, the  for  2 performanceenhancing drugs.  3  I would say judges are here to draw lines,  4 and between throwing all those things into it or drawing  5 lines, it's better to draw a few lines.  6  GENERAL VERRILLI:  We can  we can talk  7 about hypotheticals, but the key point about them is  8 that they're hypothetical.  9  JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  These are real  10 cases, by the way.  The poison potato was in fact  11  GENERAL VERRILLI:  The vinegar and the  12 goldfish is not a real case, and I would submit that de  13 minimis non curat lex  14  JUSTICE ALITO:  They're not real  they're  15 not real cases because you haven't prosecuted them yet.  16 If you told  17  (Laughter.)  18  JUSTICE ALITO:  If you told ordinary people  19 that you were going to prosecute Ms. Bond for using a  20 chemical weapon, they would be flabbergasted.  It's  21 it  it's so far outside of the ordinary meaning of the  22 word.  23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If her child had died  24 excuse me.  25  JUSTICE ALITO:  This statute has an

Chocolate is poison to dogs, so it's a  11 toxic chemical under the chemical weapons  12  GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think de minimis non  13 curat lex would take care of that, but this  there is  14 serious  this is  15  JUSTICE BREYER:  There's chocolate all over  16 the place.  17  (Laughter.)  18  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do horses eat potatoes?

38

Alderson Reporting Company

1 address yourself to is the problem of, once you depart  2 from the annexes in defining the chemicals, you throw  3 into it a list a thousand miles long.  4  And we can tell joke after joke, but it's  5 not a joke that it's so easy to make up examples that  6 seem to have nothing to do with the problem of chemical  7 weapons, like the Syrian problem, nothing to do with  8 that.  9  GENERAL VERRILLI:  I understand that, Your  10 Honor, but the law  11  JUSTICE BREYER:  So what is your answer?  12 That's what I want to know.  13  GENERAL VERRILLI:  If you will permit me to  14 answer the question this way:  The line that the  15 Petitioner is asking courts to draw is whether the  16 particular use is warlike or whether it constitutes a  17 peaceful purpose under this convention and under the  18 implementing statute.  19  Well, the very  one of the very things we  20 are trying to sort out right now in Syria, under the  21 Chemical Weapons Convention, is where the line is  22 between peaceful uses and warlike uses.  And this phrase  23 "peaceful uses" is not only in the Chemical Weapons  24 Convention, it's in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,  25 and we're engaged in very sensitive negotiations right

I mean, because this  this Convention  18 and the implementing legislation is very broad, and it's  19 broad because it applies to a very large category of  20 weapons and it applies to a very large category of  21 uses  of conduct.  22  So what were they thinking about, about why  23 they wanted these very broad categories, why it's not  24 more limited with respect either to the chemicals or to  25 the conduct?
40

Alderson Reporting Company

1  GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, with respect to the  2 chemicals, I think they made the judgment because you  3 can't predict in advance how chemicals are going to be  4 used and how toxic they will be in particular  5 combinations and how dangerous they will be in  6 particular combinations, and therefore, you need a  7 comprehensive definition.  8  JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, look, also, if you're  9 telling me  I am attempting to draw the line, that's  10 just what I was going to do.  11  And if you're saying it's against the  12 national security interest, which is the first time I've  13 heard that, that it is the national interests  against  14 the national interests of the United States for me to  15 attempt to draw such a line, then I guess the State  16 Department better file a brief explaining why or you  17 ought  or why you  why you want to push this case  18 or  I mean, I'm  is that what you're telling me,  19 that if I write the opinion that I think the law  20 requires me to write, that I somehow am hurting the  21 national security interests of the United States.  22  GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think there is  23 a  I think there is a real risk in courts getting  24 involved in defining the line between warlike and  25 peaceful purposes

That's a structure problem.  18  You've  you've given us no  no principle  19 the other way.  20  GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I  what I think  21 it would, Justice Kennedy, would suffice to decide this  22 case, were the Court to conclude that the "too local"  23 limit that the Petitioner is advocating here as an  24 asapplied, casebycase "too local" limit is not one  25 that is inconsistent with the constitutional structure

And  13 and although I'm not prepared to draw a specific line  14 here today, there  there may well be a line to be  15 drawn.  But here, the Petitioner has conceded, and I  16 think all of us would agree, this is the proper subject  17 of the treaty.  18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But there are a lot  19 of treaties, particularly I think Justice Alito pointed  20 out, after the World War II era, where you have  21 international conventions affecting everything.  We have  22 international conventions on the abduction of children,  23 international conventions that  human rights.  They  24 cover a vast swathe of  of subject matter.  25  And it seems to me the only thing you're

If  9 their authority is asserted under a treaty, is their  10 is their power to intrude upon the police power  11 unlimited?  12  GENERAL VERRILLI:  If the  if the  13 treaty  well, the way I would answer that,  14 Mr. Chief Justice, is if the treaty is valid  15  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  The treaty is  16 valid.  17  GENERAL VERRILLI:  Then implementing  18 legislation that doesn't go beyond the treaty is valid  19 even if it addresses a subject that would otherwise be  20 within the police power of the States.  21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  22  GENERAL VERRILLI:  That was the judgment the  23 framers made, and that's what  that's this case.  And  24 so  and because the treaty is valid, the Petitioner's  25 concede that the treaty is valid, this statute

1 implements the treaty  wordforword implementation of  2 the obligations that  3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you would rather  4 have the Court determine, if we're concerned about the  5 intrusion on the police power, whether treaties are  6 valid or not than whether  determine whether  7 particular implementing legislation is valid or not.  8  GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  I think, Your Honor,  9 that because it is conceded in this case that the treaty  10 is valid, and the Petitioner hasn't elaborated any  11 argument that  or any principle that would allow this  12 Court to make a judgment about when an exercise of the  13 treaty power is valid and when it isn't, that you've got  14 to take, as a given in this case, that the treaty is  15 valid  16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I know this case.  17 The point of the hypothetical is I'm trying to get your  18 general principle.  I can imagine treaties that you  19 would say are within the treaty power, again,  20 particularly in the postWorld War II era, but that  21 could give rise to implementing legislation that I think  22 would be extraordinary from the point of view of the  23 framers and the power that it gave Congress to intrude  24 upon State authority.  25  GENERAL VERRILLI:  So there is a structure
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 of limitations  you know, as I said earlier.  The  2 twothirds ratification requirement is real with respect  3 to this.  One of the treaties Your Honor just referred  4 to, the U.N. Convention on Civil and Political Rights,  5 of course, when the Senate ratified it, it did use its  6 power to make reservations to preserve our Federal  7 system.  8  So that operated in exactly the manner that  9 the framers intended there to protect, to safeguard the  10 interests of federalism.  And there are  you know,  11 there are about 1,000 ratified treaties on the books  12 right now, and we don't have the Congress using the  13 treaty power to  to usurp the role of the States  14  JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, no.  That isn't the  15 problem.  16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's  it's kind of  17 question begging.  I mean, the whole point is that some  18 people think we do have exactly that in this case.  Now,  19 usually, when we have a case that implicates significant  20 and serious bilateral concerns, we get a lot of briefs  21 and all that from our  our treaty partners.  22  Is  is there any concern that's been  23 expressed in any concrete way by them about whether  24 Mrs. Bond is prosecuted?  25  GENERAL VERRILLI:  I doubt that, Your Honor,

1 because  2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  Yes.  So  3 nothing in  4  GENERAL VERRILLI:  Nobody  no  nobody  5 would  we're not saying  and I don't think anybody  6 would say that  that whether or not Ms. Bond is  7 prosecuted would give rise to an international incident.  8 The question is whether Congress has the authority to  9 pass a comprehensive ban.  10  Now, there may, of course, be applications  11 of that comprehensive ban that don't advance the  12 national interest in a profound or poignant way; we  13 understand that.  But the question is whether Congress  14 can pass a comprehensive ban implementing a treaty.  15  JUSTICE BREYER:  That is the question  16  JUSTICE KAGAN:  And, General, don't we have  17 an amicus brief from almost all of the legal counsels of  18 the State Department, Republican and Democrat, talking  19 about how, if Petitioner's argument were accepted, it  20 would severely damage the United States' ability to  21 enter into and to negotiate treaties?  22  GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's right.  And  23 that  and that's true, it's  and that's certainly  24 true.  25  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sure that the
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 people who've worked in the national branch of  2 government, particularly for the State Department, would  3 like to have as much authority as they can get to  4 negotiate treaties.  We're concerned about limitations  5 on other.  6  Do we have any briefs from State  7 legislatures, State authorities, concerning intrusion on  8 their prerogatives?  9  GENERAL VERRILLI:  Your Honor, this  10 convention is a convention that all, but four nations on  11 Earth, have signed.  The legislation that we have  12 enacted is a model legislation that over 120 other  13 nations have enacted as well.  14  JUSTICE ALITO:  Whenever  when this Court  15 has issued decisions in recent years holding that there  16 are some limits on Congress' power, cases like Lopez and  17 Morrison and City of Boerne, there have been legal  18 commentators who have written articles saying that could  19 be circumvented to  through the use of the treaty  20 power.  Do you agree with that?  21  GENERAL VERRILLI:  I don't think there's a  22 yesorno answer to that.  I think that  because I  23 don't think it would be  the question would be:  What  24 does the treaty power encompass?  It wouldn't be a  25 circumvention if this is something that could be
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 constitutionally done under the treaty power, but  2  JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you  all right.  3 I'll take back the word "circumvention."  Could you  4 reach the opposite result?  Could it  could Congress  5 regulate the possession of a gun within a school zone by  6 entering into a treaty that authorizes such legislation?  7  GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think the question in  8 that case would be whether the treaty is a valid  9 exercise of the treaty power.  10  JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, but it is.  That is the  11 problem.  There is an underlying  I don't mean to cut  12 you off, but at some point, you seem not to see a  13 problem that I think I see.  14  And the problem underlying it, if you get  15 into the treaty area, is this:  Given the power, as  16 there is in Medellin's majority, to have some  17 selfexecuting treaties, in principle, your position  18 constitutionally would allow the President and the  19 Senate, not the House, to do anything through a treaty  20 that is not specifically within the prohibitions of the  21 rights protections of the Constitution.  22  That's Missouri v. Holland.  And I doubt  23 that, in that document, the Framers intended to allow  24 the President and the Senate to do anything.  25  Now, you ask us, now, to say whether the
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 answer to that question is yes or no.  We still have a  2 democracy, in other words, of which the House is part.  3 Now, if you carry it to an extreme, that's what you  4 are  that's where you are, and I am worried about  5 that, and I think others are, too.  6  So I had asked you, isn't there an easier  7 way to deal with this case?  And you tell me, no, no,  8 because it will interfere with some problem of foreign  9 affairs that was never mentioned in any brief  or at  10 least hit me for the first time when you said it.  11  Now, there, you have an expression of my  12 uncertainties at the moment, and any way you want to  13 reply to that would be helpful.  14  GENERAL VERRILLI:  I understand the point,  15 Justice Breyer, I do.  I understand that there is  16 something that seemed attractive in trying think about  17 this as a question of statutory construction.  What I'm  18 trying to point out is that it's not as easy as it  19 seems, that there are real risks to trying to draw a  20 line of that kind.  And, yes, that does  I understand  21 that.  22  That  that does raise the stakes some, I  23 understand that.  But I think that risk is real, and I  24 think it  that risk is real, the risk that the State  25 Department legal advisor's brief pointed out is real of
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 undermining our ability  2  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Verrilli, before  3 your time is out, you haven't answered directly why the  4 Bill of Rights does constrain the treaty power, the  5 implementation of it, Reid v. Colbert?  6  Why is the Bill of Rights different from the  7 federalism concern that the Court has expressed in many  8 cases, when you say, yes, there is a check, the Bill of  9 Rights is a check, but not the Tenth Amendment.  10  GENERAL VERRILLI:  There is a historical  11 answer to that question, Justice Ginsburg, which is that  12 that's how the framers understood it.  I think that's  13 clear from what Hamilton said in the  in the quotes  14 that we have in our brief, and others of the Framers  15 understood that that's where the line would be.  16  And I think the reason for that is that the  17 treaty power is, itself, a great and substantial  18 independent power of the national government.  And it is  19 not constrained by a "too local" limitation.  That is  20 the lesson of the era of the framing, that there is a  21 not a "too local" limitation on the exercise of the  22 treaty power.  23  And, therefore, while  24  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, all of those quotes  25 pertain to selfexecuting treaties.  Yes, there is no
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 limitation on what  what the President and the Senate  2 can impose as a selfexecuting requirement, namely, that  3 the States must give back to British citizens property  4 that they confiscated or whatever else.  5  But it's a different question whether a  6 treaty can expand the power of the Federal Congress into  7 areas that it has never been before.  That's a separate  8 question.  And neither Hamilton, nor any of the other  9 quotes that you refer to, address that question.  10  GENERAL VERRILLI:  Your Honor, so long as  11 the treaty  it's a valid exercise of the treaty power,  12 I think a fortiori, if all you do is implement the  13 treaty in haec verba, it's a valid exercise of Congress'  14 power.  15  And I will say, I said, earlier, that this  16 is serious business.  I understand that principles of  17 federalism are serious business also, but federalism is  18 a twoway street.  And with respect to the exercise of  19 the treaty power, the framers made a judgment that  20 that this power was going to be exclusively in the hands  21 of the national government.  22  And it needed to be exclusively in the hands  23 of the national government, in order to ensure that the  24 United States could be a full sovereign on the world  25 stage.
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1  Now, it is true that the subject matter of  2 treaties is different now than it was at the time of the  3 founding, but the  but the framers understood that.  4 They were careful not to impose subject matter  5 limitations on the treaty power because they were wise  6 enough to know they could not foresee what might be  7 important for the United States to be able to negotiate  8 about on a world stage in order to participate fully as  9 a sovereign.  10  That  and the Chemical Weapons Convention  11 is a deeply apt illustration of exactly why the framers  12 were wise in ensuring that there were not subject matter  13 limitations on the exercise of the treaty power.  14  The Chemical Weapons Convention  the  15 United States' leadership in the Chemical Weapons  16 Convention has made a big difference in ensuring that  17 this norm, which is in our national interests, our  18 foreign relations interests, and our national security  19 interest, is a norm that the  that the nations of the  20 world have agreed to and that we are then in a position  21 to have leverage to insist that the nations of the world  22 abide by it.  23  It is leverage we are trying to exercise  24 right now.  It is critically important, and I  25 respectfully submit that the line that the Petitioner is
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 asking this Court to draw is not consistent with the  2 intent of the framers, with this Court's precedent or  3 with the national interests that I have described.  4  Thank you.  5  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.  6  Mr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining.  7  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT  8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER  9  MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  10 Just a few points in rebuttal.  11  First of all, the Senate's role in the  12 ratification of treaties cannot be a sufficient  13 political check, and one reason is that, sometimes, the  14 precise role they play as a check is to make a treaty  15 nonselfexecuting.  16  And so, to take Justice Scalia's  17 hypothetical example of an international treaty that  18 purported to regulate marriage rights, one thing that  19 the Senate very well might do in that case is to say,  20 well, we will ratify it, but we're going to make sure  21 it's nonselfexecuting, and maybe we will use our  22 spending power or something to get the States on board,  23 but we are not just going to impose a national solution.  24  So it doesn't make any sense to say that a  25 nonselfexecuting treaty necessarily, even if it's
54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 valid, guarantees the validity of the enacting  2 legislation, because some of the reason that you make a  3 treaty nonselfexecuting is to preserve federalism.  4  A second point is to respond to the  5 argument, which I think I've already explained why it's  6 not correct, but it is the suggestion that there is no  7 daylight between the convention and the statute.  There  8 is huge daylight, and the daylight is precisely whether  9 it affects individual conduct and how it affects  10 individual conduct.  11  With all respect, everything on  12 Justice Breyer's List A is not stuff that I think  13 implicates the convention at all.  But, yet, under the  14 government's unwavering theory that you can't make any  15 limitations on the statute, that's all covered by the  16 statute.  There's your daylight.  17  Now, I would respectfully suggest that our  18 statutory construction argument is one way out of this.  19 I think that you have to understand the way that  20 "peaceful" is used in the statute is, essentially, a  21 term of art. I would analogize it to a situation where  22 two scientists in Antarctica get in a fistfight.  23  Okay.  That's not conduct we would condone,  24 but I don't think we've violated our pledge to reserve  25 Antarctica for only peaceful purposes.  And that's the
55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 same way we would like you to interpret this statute.  2  Now, the government says you can't do that  3 because that's going to mess up what's going on in  4 Syria.  With all due respect, I assume that the issue in  5 Syria is whether or not the nation state of Syria is  6 doing something that would violate the convention if,  7 contrary to fact, they were signatory to this  8 convention.  9  So if you want to make clear that you're  10 only talking about individual conduct, I think you can  11 solve that whole problem right there.  But if I'm wrong  12 and the only way, as the government assures you that you  13 can make this legislation work is to have it be an  14 exercise of the police power, well, then the answer is  15 that the legislation is simply unconstitutional.  16  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I just ask you,  17 Mr. Clement, and it's a variant of the hypothetical I  18 gave you before, but it focuses more on your statutory  19 point, the peaceful purposes.  20  Suppose that Ms. Bond used Sarin gas and  21 sent it through the ducts of Haynes' house; would you  22 say that that's a peaceful purpose?  23  MR. CLEMENT:  I would say it's not, but I  24 think it has to do more with the particular qualities of  25 Sarin gas, the fact that it's on Schedule A, the fact
56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that nobody can possess that for any lawful use.  2  And what makes something like vinegar or  3 even potassium dichromate different is what puts it over  4 the ledge from being an ordinary chemical to a chemical  5 weapon is precisely its use and its use alone.  6  Now, Justice Kagan, you asked a great  7 question.  What was Congress thinking when they did  8 this?  I think, with respect, the Congress wasn't  9 focused on this issue at all.  10  If you look at the legislation they passed  11 to implement this, the chemical industry and others put  12 in front of them the possibility that there was a Fourth  13 Amendment problem with the inspections of chemical  14 production facilities that were authorized under the  15 convention.  When Congress had the constitutional  16 problem in front of it, they had all sorts of provisions  17 to deal with that constitutional concern.  18  Now, the future Ms. Bonds of the world  19 didn't have quite the same lobbying resources as the  20 chemist  the chemical industry, so they didn't avert  21 to this problem.  And that's precisely why some kind of  22 clear statement rule or the like would make perfect  23 sense in this, to make sure Congress doesn't exercise  24 the police power, when all it thinks it's doing is  25 implementing a treaty.
