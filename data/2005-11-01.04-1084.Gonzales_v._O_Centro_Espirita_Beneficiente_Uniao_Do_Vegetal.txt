2 [11:05 a.m.]

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument next

4 in Gonzales versus O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do

5 Vegetal.

6 Mr. Kneedler.

7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

8 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

9 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11 The Court of Appeals decision in this case

12 carves out an exception to the categorical prohibition for

13 the Controlled Substances Act in order to permit

14 respondents to import, distribute, and use a Schedule 1

15 controlled substance. The Court of Appeals believed this

16 exception was justified by the Religious Freedom

17 Restoration Act in order to enable respondents to use

18 hoasca tea, which contains dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, in

19 the substance, for religious purposes. The court of

20 appeals was wrong. RFRA carries forward the compelling-

21 interest test, as set forth in prior Federal court

22 decisions.

23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: May I address a preliminary

24 inquiry that I have? Are we reviewing here the issuance

25 of the injunction by the trial court?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, a preliminary injunction.

2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And we have to find that, for

3 the trial court to have issued it, it was an abuse of

4 discretion?

5 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, with respect to certain

6 aspects of the preliminary injunction question, yes. For

7 example, whether a preliminary injunction should -- is the

8 proper remedy if all the other criteria are satisfied.

9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: You know --

10 MR. KNEEDLER: But --

11 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- the court found evidence

12 in equipoise and so on and so forth, so I just wondered,

13 at the bottom line, what our legal standard is here.

14 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. We believe that the Court

15 of Appeals erred -- or District Court and Court of Appeals

16 erred, as a matter of law, in entering the injunction --

17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Abused its discretion.

18 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, abused -- a court always

19 abuses its discretion if it -- if it commits a legal

20 error. So, that is basically our position here.

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me your position

22 is that you must -- we must give controlling determinative

23 weight to the fact that it's listed in Schedule 1. And

24 the respondents say you don't give it any weight at all,

25 it's all on a case-by-case basis. Is there a middle

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 ground that there -- which I think would allow you to

2 prevail here -- that there is a presumption that there is

3 a compelling governmental interest when it's in Schedule

4 1? It's a rebuttable presumption, but it's a presumption

5 that, when it's in Schedule 1, it's a compelling interest.

6 MR. KNEEDLER: Well --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The --

8 MR. KNEEDLER: -- first of all, our principal

9 submission is that Congress's designation in Schedule 1 is

10 sufficient unto itself. But we also do include a further

11 submission that, if the Court didn't disagree with that,

12 that Congress's -- Congress, in Schedule 1, has said that

13 any mixture containing any amount of a listed

14 hallucinogenic substance is barred. And there's no

15 question that this substance contains that. But if the

16 Court was going to look beyond that to the facts of this

17 case, there's also no question in this case that

18 respondents' use of the substance produces the very

19 effects that led Congress to put the substance on Schedule

20 1. So, to allow the -- to allow the substance to be used

21 would be in direct derogation of Congress's judgment.

22 The disagreement, such as there is, goes not to

23 the -- not to that question. And that's on page 214(a) of

24 the joint appendix -- or the petition appendix. The

25 District Court specifically found that those effects are

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 produced. Respondents' argument in the lower courts was

2 essentially that those effects shouldn't matter, or that

3 those effects should be ignored. But we think that that's

4 inconsistent with Congress's judgment. So, my point is,

5 if you go beyond the text of the statute, it shouldn't be

6 for anything more than to -- for the Court to assure

7 itself that the effects that caused Congress to list the

8 subject, in fact, occur, and --

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but part of the statute

11 is Sherbert and Verner and the test that Congress says we

12 have to apply to its acts here.

13 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. But under -- the Act does

14 say carry forward the prior Federal court decisions. But,

15 prior to Smith, this Court, on a number of occasions, had

16 recognized the compelling interest in uniform enforcement

17 of important statutes that could not function under a

18 system of individualized religious --

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. --

20 MR. KNEEDLER: -- exemptions.

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Mr. Kneedler, I think

22 everyone would concede that there is a compelling

23 interest, governmental interest, to have the Controlled

24 Substances Act on that level, yes. But then, Congress has

25 passed another statute that says all laws shall be subject

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to RFRA -- shall be subject to RFRA. So, we can't just

2 look at "Is there a compelling State interest for the

3 controlled Substances Act?" in a vacuum. We have to take

4 what was a later statute, RFRA, to which the Controlled

5 Substances Act is made subject by Congress. And I thought

6 the argument was: Is there a compelling State interest in

7 that context? How can there be, given the situation with

8 peyote and, "We're just like the Native American Church in

9 that regard"?

10 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the argument is not that

11 the Controlled Substances Act is not subject to RFRA. It

12 is subject to RFRA. But -- just as it was subject to the

13 First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause -- and, in this

14 Court's pre-Smith cases, in which the Court -- at least

15 Congress understood the Court to have been applying a

16 compelling-interest test, the Court was applying that

17 compelling-interest test to particular statutes under

18 which individualized religious exemptions would not be

19 feasible, and held, as a categorical matter, that they

20 were not required. The Social Security Act, the tax code,

21 the laws against polygamy, the Sunday closing laws, all

22 are -- all of those are ones in which the Court had

23 previously concluded that individualized exceptions were

24 not appropriate.

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I would understand that if

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the Government had acted uniformly. But we do have two

2 situations that seem to be like -- the peyote and this

3 case. And if the Government must accommodate to one, why

4 not to the other?

5 MR. KNEEDLER: In the peyote exception, Congress

6 was acting under its distinct constitutionally recognized

7 authority with respect to Indian tribes. The Indian

8 Commerce Clause specifically authorizes Congress to

9 legislate with respect to Indian tribes --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's --

11 MR. KNEEDLER: -- as --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it still shows -- whatever

13 power they were -- they were proceeding under, it still

14 shows that it's not all that important that nobody be able

15 to use a substance banned by category 1. I mean --

16 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- whatever power it was under,

18 it's a demonstration that you can make an exception

19 without the sky falling.

20 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I, in no way, think that

21 Congress believed that by enacting the special provision

22 for Indian tribes, it was thereby opening the Controlled

23 Substances Act to individualized --

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --

25 MR. KNEEDLER: -- religious exceptions.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- maybe Congress didn't assume

2 that. They probably didn't think about it. But what's

3 wrong with the argument?

4 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think what's wrong with

5 the argument is that what Congress did with respect to

6 Indian tribes was take a look at that distinct context and

7 conclude that, for a variety of reasons -- and,

8 particularly, respecting the autonomous authority of an

9 independent Indian tribe to control its internal affairs

10 this exception applies only to members of recognized

11 Indian tribes -- that, in that context, balancing all of

12 the relevant considerations -- not the sort of balance

13 under RFRA --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it --

15 MR. KNEEDLER: -- but balancing all the

16 considerations under the -- its Indian power, concluded

17 there was --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: But Justice Scalia's point is,

19 no matter what the legal theory, the evidence, historical

20 evidence, seems to indicate that the sky didn't fall. And

21 if it didn't fall for the larger number of Native

22 Americans involved who use peyote, and the very small

23 number using this drug, can't we, kind of, think that at

24 least, "Well, maybe it's not all that compelling"?

25 MR. KNEEDLER: But that was -- that was a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 specific judgment made by Congress itself, looking at --

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Kneedler, may I --

3 MR. KNEEDLER: -- all the factors.

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- may I stop you --

5 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- there? Because, correct

7 me if I'm wrong, but it was my impression that the DEA was

8 allowing an exemption for peyote use by the Native

9 American Church before Congress passed the law.

10 MR. KNEEDLER: That -- that's correct, but that

11 was understood at the -- at -- back in 1970, or back,

12 actually, in '65, when that was first adopted, to have

13 been consistent with Congress's original intent in passing

14 the statute, and the Controlled Substances Act, which

15 carried forward the schedules. But, in any event,

16 Congress has now addressed the subject by statute,

17 following the enactment of RFRA, following this Court's

18 decision in Smith, and which has brought things into quite

19 different focus.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you take it that the

21 Government was right -- before Congress passed the law,

22 the Government was right to give the exemption to allow

23 that ceremonial use of peyote, then I don't see how you

24 get mileage from a congressional act that was passed later

25 than Congress's is saying, "Executive, we agree with you,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you did right." But it's not -- you -- I don't see how

2 you can rely on the congressional statute when the

3 Government was doing this even without a --

4 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- congressional statute.

6 MR. KNEEDLER: -- the statute actually, you

7 know, now gives some firm statutory basis for that

8 exception, which may not really have existed so

9 comfortably after this Court's decision in Smith. And

10 there was, it's true, nothing specific in the statute

11 before. The critical point, though, to bear in mind for

12 the sort of claim that respondents are arguing for here is

13 that it would turn over to 700 district judges a

14 determination based on particular records, particular

15 credibility determinations, the judgment as to whether --

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but --

17 MR. KNEEDLER: -- an exception --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- isn't that exactly the --

19 what the Act does? That's --

20 MR. KNEEDLER: No --

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- why they passed it.

22 MR. KNEEDLER: With all respect --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's why we came out the

24 other way in Smith, by the way.

25 MR. KNEEDLER: But --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 [Laughter.]

2 MR. KNEEDLER: -- but even when Congress went

3 back to pre-Smith, again Congress recognized that there

4 are certain statutes in -- that serve a compelling

5 interest that would be undermined by individualized

6 determinations, and the Controlled --

7 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it didn't --

8 MR. KNEEDLER: -- Substances Act --

9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- say that, did it? I mean,

10 it did seem to indicate, after the passage of RFRA, courts

11 are supposed to examine, in each case, whether there is a

12 compelling State interest and whether it's closely enough

13 related.

14 MR. KNEEDLER: But it -- but that was the test

15 that the Court was applying, as Congress understood it,

16 prior to Smith, in which, I repeat, the Court said there

17 were certain statutes that categorical judgments could be

18 made about. And the Controlled Substances Act is such a

19 statute, as this Court recognized in Raich and in Oakland

20 Cannabis --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I want you --

22 MR. KNEEDLER: -- where the Court --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to stay on this point,

24 because it's important, but if this were a Schedule 2

25 substance, would your argument be the same?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KNEEDLER: Our argument would be the same,

2 but for an additional reason there, and that is that even

3 where Congress has -- or even where a substance may be

4 distributed and used, it is only for medical purposes,

5 which is in furtherance of, not in derogation of, the

6 health and safety purposes of the statute. And even then,

7 it is done to very strict -- pursuant to very strict

8 controls that are really incompatible with sacramental use

9 of a substance. There is a requirement of prescription,

10 or dispensing by a physician under physician control, with

11 recordkeeping -- identifying the dosage, the amount of the

12 sacrament -- recordkeeping of the person who takes it.

13 There is -- there is an incompatibility and potential

14 entanglement problem in how to -- in trying to apply a

15 system like that, even under Schedule 2. But under

16 Schedule 1, what you have is contraband, as this Court

17 said --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: But suppose we --

19 MR. KNEEDLER: -- in Raich.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I grant you that

21 administrative considerations are relevant. Of course

22 they're relevant. But that's far from saying they're

23 determinative. And then we're back to what Justice Souter

24 said, absolutely relevant in deciding the compelling

25 interest, but the fact that peyote seems to have been

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 administered without the sky falling in suggests that,

2 here, they're not determinative. That's all.

3 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, if I could go back to the

4 way the Controlled Substances Act operates, it does not

5 permit a rescheduling or use of a drug based on

6 individualized determinations made by individual Federal

7 District Courts making their own judgment about how

8 serious the risk is. If a substance is going to be moved

9 from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2, for example, to allow

10 medical use, that is done through a centralized

11 administrative determination involving coordination

12 between the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the

13 Attorney General, in which expert opinions are gotten and

14 a judgment is made, but the judgment is made only if there

15 is an accepted medical use. In other words, there has to

16 be not -- a consensus, not simply an -- a determination by

17 one religious group or one judge --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: But --

19 MR. KNEEDLER: -- that something may be so.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- RFRA overrides all that.

21 MR. KNEEDLER: No. I --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand RFRA to be -- to

23 say there can be an exception to all Federal statutes

24 where someone makes a religious objection to compliance

25 and, in the judgment of the court, there's not a

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 compelling State interest in the Government going ahead

2 with the statute. So, you know, whatever the scheme was

3 under the drug laws, it seems to me it's subject to this

4 new legislation.

5 MR. KNEEDLER: We're not saying it's not subject

6 to the legislation, but in deciding how the compelling

7 interest applies under the statute -- just as under the

8 First Amendment itself, before RFRA was passed, and the

9 one is to replicate the other -- the court -- there were

10 certain statutes, when the court looked at the way they

11 operated and what was necessary to their effectuation, the

12 court said that individualized exceptions would not be

13 feasible. And there's no reason to believe, and every

14 reason to disbelieve --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, when you talk

16 about --

17 MR. KNEEDLER: -- that Congress meant to put

18 that to one side.

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- reasons to believe

20 and disbelieve, we don't have to make a once-and-for-all

21 determination, do we? A lot of your concerns talk about

22 what's going to happen if this exception is granted. Now,

23 if some of those things come true, can't this issue be

24 revisited? I don't regard -- maybe I'm wrong, but, under

25 RFRA, you're not saying it's a compelling-interest test.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 It may be -- may not be satisfied in this case, but if it

2 turns out there's a lot of diversion of the hallucinogen

3 or the membership of the church expands in a way that

4 leads you to believe it's being abused, I mean, then you'd

5 look at it again, right?

6 MR. KNEEDLER: I have several responses to that.

7 That sort of approach, putting to the test basically a

8 congregation-by-congregation -- or denomination-by-

9 denomination, to use familiar terms -- test about whether

10 a -- an exception should be recognized for a particular

11 religion, itself, presents difficult questions. If you --

12 if you have a particular religious sect that believes that

13 it is -- that it is important to invite everyone to the

14 table -- not simply a closed group that has gone through

15 screening, but a -- but everyone to their table --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that --

17 MR. KNEEDLER: -- that would be -- but that

18 would -- that -- the -- a court would be in a judgment

19 about -- in saying that that --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Couldn't have said it better.

21 And that's what we said in Smith. But Congress didn't

22 like Smith and has enacted this statute obviously to undo,

23 to the extent it can, the effect of our judgment in

24 Smith.

25 MR. KNEEDLER: No, what -- it did not seek

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to undo the judgment in Smith. What the Court was -- what

2 Congress was responding to was the -- what it understood

3 to be the test. It reinstated the compelling-interest

4 test, but specifically said it was not disagreeing with

5 the outcome of any particular case under that prior test.

6 And three of those cases -- Hernandez, concerning the tax

7 code; Lee, concerning the Social Security Act; and

8 Braunfeld, regarding the Sunday closing laws -- were all

9 ones that adopted the approach that I have suggested.

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your -- but your

11 approach is totally categorical. If you had a group that

12 had, once a year, one drop of the hallucinogen involved

13 here, per member, and it was rigorously policed, your

14 position would still be the same --

15 MR. KNEEDLER: Our --

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- even applying RFRA,

17 which sets forth a compelling-interest test.

18 MR. KNEEDLER: -- our principal position would

19 be the same. And I -- and I think that that approach is

20 consistent with Justice O'Connor's opinion in Smith, which

21 got a lot of prominence in the subsequent debate about

22 RFRA, because, in that -- in that opinion, even though the

23 compelling-interest test was applied, Justice O'Connor

24 concluded that that test was satisfied because --

25 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But Congress disagreed,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 ultimately. They allowed the use of peyote.

2 MR. KNEEDLER: And that's an important

3 point. Congress doing it does not open the Controlled

4 Substances Act to the individualized determinations by 700

5 District Courts. It makes --

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler --

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but in --

8 MR. KNEEDLER: -- a specialized judgment.

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- may Congress, consistent

10 with the Establishment Clause, say that we will create an

11 exception for peyote, but not for this other church, which

12 has far fewer members, less risk of diversion, has been

13 found to be a genuine religion? The problem of preferring

14 one religious group over another, it seems to me, arises

15 once there is an exception for the Native American Church.

16 And I heard you say, "Well, the Indian tribes are

17 special," but is that -- that's it. It would have to be

18 --

19 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, we think that -- we think

20 that's critical, because what -- just as in this Court's

21 decision in Laurel, what Congress has done is to act to

22 respect the autonomous, independent institutions of the

23 tribe. That also meets certain law enforcement concerns,

24 because you have the tribal government, you have tribal

25 law enforcement personnel, you have tribal culture and

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 tradition that is independent simply of the religion. You

2 have -- you have the entire tribal cultural structure that

3 Congress could quite reasonably regard as being different.

4 And respecting that distinct political attribute of

5 tribes under this Court's decision in Morton versus

6 Mancari, we don't think, creates an Establishment Clause

7 problem. What --

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I -- may I ask you one

9 question about the procedural posture of this case? This

10 is an appeal from a preliminary injunction. That's how it

11 got here. And we have been discussing, mostly, the case

12 just as though it had been a permanent injunction. The --

13 there are pieces of this case, like the Treaty and what it

14 allows and doesn't allow, that -- where the record is so

15 thin. Is there a way of dealing with this case so there

16 is the full airing that it never got, without resolving,

17 at this point, other issues --

18 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I --

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you've been debating?

20 MR. KNEEDLER: -- I -- on that limited point, if

21 the Court applied the usual standards for the granting of

22 a preliminary injunction, I think that the Court could

23 quite readily reverse the preliminary injunction here,

24 because that requires a clear showing of a substantial

25 likelihood of success on the merits, plus that the other

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 factors be decided. And with respect to the application

2 of the Convention, that's really a question of law. And

3 the United States took the position before the District

4 Court in this case, that the Convention applied to the

5 tea. We think it's unquestionably a mixture, and,

6 therefore, a preparation within the meaning of the -- of

7 the Convention, and the -- and the District Court's

8 injunction really puts the United States in violation of

9 an international agreement that is critical to prohibiting

10 trafficking --

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they were --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do --

13 MR. KNEEDLER: -- in drugs.

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- do your briefs --

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- indicate, or does the

17 record indicate, that the Government was foreclosed from

18 presenting any evidence it wanted to present? If you, for

19 some reason, go back, and this whole thing is done again,

20 whether they -- is there important additional evidence for

21 you to introduce, or do we essentially have the case in

22 front of us, so far as you're concerned?

23 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, in -- as far as our

24 position is concerned on our submission so far, we don't

25 think the Court needs any further evidence. On the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 question of the application of the Convention, as we say,

2 we believe that is a question of law. This Court has long

3 deferred to the position of the executive branch on the

4 interpretation of Conventions. And --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I was a little

6 unclear about your position on the Convention. I thought,

7 at some -- one point, you said that it didn't really add

8 much to your argument under the Controlled Substances Act,

9 which implemented the Convention. Is --

10 MR. KNEEDLER: No, it --

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- there an independent

12 --

13 MR. KNEEDLER: No, it --

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- argument?

15 MR. KNEEDLER: No, we believe that complying

16 with an international Convention designed to prohibit

17 trafficking in drugs is, itself, a compelling interest.

18 And the -- under this Court's decisions in --

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: How --

20 MR. KNEEDLER: -- that would be incorporated in

21 RFRA. And it -- a -- an order that puts the United States

22 in violation of that -- and the Court of Appeals didn't

23 really deny -- a majority of the judges, anyway -- deny

24 that this injunction requires the United States to violate

25 the Convention --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it --

2 MR. KNEEDLER: -- by facilitating the

3 importation of drugs from outside the country.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what do you -- here's the

5 problem that I have, particularly at the stage of the

6 preliminary injunction, with that argument. The --

7 they're -- the Convention also includes that provision

8 that its terms will be defined, enforced, and so on, in

9 harmony, or conformity, with the domestic law of the

10 signatory. Our domestic law includes RFRA. That would

11 seem to open the door for, in effect, a RFRA exception.

12 MR. KNEEDLER: No, that exception is --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me -- let me just

14 finish my -- let me get to my -- let me get to my question

15 --

16 MR. KNEEDLER: Sorry.

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- before you answer it.

18 [Laughter.]

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: My -- the particular concern I

20 have with that, at the preliminary injunction stage, is

21 not necessarily that that particular argument should, for

22 all times, be assessed correctly by the -- by the District

23 Court. But it seems to me that if the District Court at

24 least plausibly reads that exception to negate your

25 argument, isn't that good enough, at the preliminary

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 injunction stage, as a basis for the Court saying, "Look,

2 you haven't -- you, the Government -- haven't carried your

3 burden to show the affirmative defense here"?

4 MR. KNEEDLER: This is a -- the interpretation

5 of the Convention is a legal question, not a factual one.

6 And Article 22 refers --

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: It is, there's no question.

8 But we're still at the preliminary injunction stage.

9 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. But respondent would bear

10 the -- would bear the burden of --

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why does the respondent bear

12 the burden? You have the burden --

13 MR. KNEEDLER: Because this is to --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- under the statute.

15 MR. KNEEDLER: -- this is a change of the status

16 quo. And to require the Government to allow the

17 importation of a substance that's prohibited by the

18 Convention. But if I --

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --

20 MR. KNEEDLER: -- if I could --

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- no, but I realize that --

22 could we pause on that for a second? Because you

23 apparently take the position -- the Government takes the

24 position that when -- under the governing law, the

25 Government would have an affirmative burden, ultimately,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to defend -- in this case, on compelling interest, least

2 restrictive, et cetera -- that, at the preliminary

3 injunction stage, the applicant for the injunction has the

4 burden to negate the probability that the Government will

5 carry its burden on the ultimate issue. And I don't see

6 why that should be so at all.

7 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, at least with respect to

8 the interpretation of a Convention, where the -- where the

9 Government has taken --

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but let --

11 MR. KNEEDLER: No, I --

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- just --

13 MR. KNEEDLER: -- I under- --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- go through --

15 MR. KNEEDLER: -- I understand the --

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Get to the Convention --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I understand the broader

18 point, but --

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- later. Get to the general

20 -- first get to the general issue. Does the applicant for

21 the injunction have the burden to negate the probability

22 that the Government will prevail in its affirmative

23 defense, ultimately?

24 MR. KNEEDLER: We --

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that your position?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, that is our position, and we

2 cite cases in the -- in the brief that say that. But it

3 is not critical to the outcome of this case with respect

4 to the Convention issue and several other of the issues

5 that --

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well --

7 MR. KNEEDLER: -- that I -- that I was going to

8 --

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the Convention --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So --

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- issue goes directly to your

12 affirmative defense.

13 MR. KNEEDLER: It goes -- but it is a question

14 of law. And the article of the Convention that you're

15 referring to is -- concerns the penal provisions. In

16 other words, Article 7 of the Convention requires each

17 party to prohibit -- this is Article 7, on page 288(a) --

18 requires that -- each State to prohibit these substances.

19 Twenty-two simply goes to the criminal provisions that

20 each party's State will adopt internally to carry that

21 out. But it doesn't -- it doesn't detract from the --

22 from the categorical obligation under Article 7, which --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the --

24 MR. KNEEDLER: -- would prohibit it.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: -- part of the Treaty question

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that I had is also -- this is a root that you are -- and

2 it contains DMT. And the Treaty doesn't ban everything

3 that contains DMT -- for example, pineapple and bananas.

4 The question is the ratio of the DMT to the entire plant.

5 MR. KNEEDLER: Well --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: And that sounds like a factual

7 question that ought to be developed.

8 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think where you have a

9 mixture that -- a mixture of two plants that are put

10 together for the specific purpose of using them for the

11 hallucinogenic purposes, that goes far beyond simply

12 whether a particular substance --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: Pineapples, we -- what about

14 those?

15 MR. KNEEDLER: Well --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: I drank pineapple --

17 MR. KNEEDLER: Plants --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: -- juice this morning.

19 [Laughter.]

20 MR. KNEEDLER: -- as such, are not covered. But

21 when you make a mixture of something for the specific

22 purpose of releasing its hallucinogenic purpose --

23 qualities, we think that that's clearly covered by the

24 Convention.

25 If I may reserve the --

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say -- I'm sorry.

8 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NANCY HOLLANDER

9 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

10 MS. HOLLANDER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11 please the Court:

12 The Government's position here, that the Court

13 should completely defer to Congress's generalized finding

14 to wholly exempt Schedule 1 of Controlled Substances Act

15 from RFRA's mandate is fundamentally and structurally

16 incompatible with RFRA.

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you seem to give the fact

18 that it's listed in Schedule 1 zero weight. It seems to

19 me, at the very least, there should be a presumption that

20 this is a compelling interest.

21 MS. HOLLANDER: Yes, Your Honor, and --

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And when the -- and when the

23 evidence is in equipoise, as the district judge thought it

24 would, that presumption, it seems to me, carries the day

25 for the Government.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. HOLLANDER: Your Honor, the District Court

2 -- we give it deference, as did the District Court. Judge

3 Parker specifically found, contrary to what the Government

4 says, that he began by looking at Schedule 1, and he

5 specifically says -- I believe it's on page 212(a) of the

6 petitioner's appendix -- that he had to begin there. And

7 he said, "This Court must give due regard for the fact

8 that Congress put DMT into Schedule 1." But then he

9 applied RFRA. And in applying RFRA, he went on to apply

10 RFRA and to specifically find that applying RFRA, which

11 requires not only a compelling interest, but a compelling

12 interest to the person, that the Government did not meet

13 its burden in this case of showing harm, any risk of harm,

14 to these members, or any risk of diversion.

15 And I'd like to go back, for a moment, to the

16 issue of peyote, because, first of all, if you look at the

17 congressional record in 1965, for what that's worth,

18 there's not one mention -- and it's on page -- starts on

19 page 480 of the joint appendix -- there's no mention of

20 Indian tribes, there's no mention of sovereign issues with

21 the Indian tribes. There's a mention of the Native

22 American Church and the First Amendment and why this

23 exemption has to be made. And, in fact, our record is --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we know whether you can be a

25 member of that church without being an Indian?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. HOLLANDER: Yes, sir, we do, Your Honor. We

2 know that. And it is throughout our brief. There's many

3 mentions of it, the fact that there have been non-Native-

4 American members since the beginning of the Native

5 American Church. I would direct the Court to the easiest

6 one, which is at the joint appendix at page 500, which is

7 a memo from a DEA legal counsel talking about this. And,

8 in fact, at the hearing in our case, on the very last day

9 -- it was on November 2nd, 2001, at page 1933 -- Mr. Adam

10 Zubin, representing the Government, specifically said, and

11 I quote, "The Federal Government places no restrictions on

12 who can participate in the Native American Church."

13 So, we have two things. We have the exemption

14 in 1965 --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your theory would be

16 if you had a religious group that -- whose doctrine was

17 that you should proselytize through hoasca, and they want

18 everybody to come, and they're aggressive in doing that,

19 and distributing hoasca, that the Government should be in

20 a position of saying, "This religious group can use it,

21 but that religious group can't"?

22 MS. HOLLANDER: Your Honor, it would depend,

23 again, on the facts of that case.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, they're the kind of

25 the -- the ones I just gave you. In other words, if

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there's going to be a greater threat of diversion to --

2 it's not limited to the members of a very cohesive and

3 limited group, but it's -- they're -- they aggressively

4 try to reach out, but it's all part of a sincere religious

5 belief, that we should, in applying RFRA, draw

6 distinctions between the group you represent and that

7 hypothetical group?

8 MS. HOLLANDER: The distinctions -- yes and no,

9 and let me explain, Your Honor -- Mr. Chief Justice -- the

10 distinction is that if the Government could meet a

11 compelling interest and actually show a risk of diversion

12 --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm assuming they

14 show --

15 MS. HOLLANDER: -- that they --

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that there is --

17 MS. HOLLANDER: -- showed it --

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

19 MS. HOLLANDER: -- then they would have

20 different facts. And the different facts in that case

21 would mean that, in that case, the Government would win.

22 Now, I'd like to point out, although I realize

23 you've just presented me with a hypothetical -- however,

24 there are 250,000 members of the Native American Church,

25 and the record in our case is that there's never been any

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 evidence of any diversion. And, although the Government

2 has --

3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if we --

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just --

5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- think that the Treaty --

6 the Convention entered into in 1971 -- makes clear that

7 hoasca is covered, then does that provide a compelling

8 interest for the Government, because it requires the

9 Government to prohibit the importation? If we think, as a

10 matter of law, the Convention covers hoasca.

11 MS. HOLLANDER: No, Your Honor, it doesn't,

12 because, again, the Government has -- we have to look at

13 the Treaty, just like we look at any other law -- RFRA

14 clearly says --

15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if we conclude, looking

16 at the Treaty, that it prohibits hoasca, covers it, and

17 that it provides that nations that enter into the

18 Convention must avoid importation of it, then is that a

19 compelling interest under RFRA?

20 MS. HOLLANDER: It may -- yes, Your Honor --

21 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It is?

22 MS. HOLLANDER: -- it may be a compelling

23 interest, but it still may not satisfy RFRA, because RFRA

24 specifically requires that it be a compelling interest to

25 the person. And we -- the Government would have to put on

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 evidence. And even though this is a question of law, that

2 doesn't preclude the District Court hearing evidence which

3 he has not heard at -- to this point -- put on evidence

4 showing that the -- that the compelling interest the

5 Government has asserted in this case, which is that it

6 would lose its leadership position in the international

7 community, would really be a compelling interest, and that

8 it could not be accommodating.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that isn't the compelling

10 interest. The compelling interest is, we signed a Treaty,

11 and you follow it. Now, how can you say that the

12 Government wouldn't have a compelling interest in

13 following a Treaty where they -- where they promised to

14 ban the substance? I mean, they're not -- they're just

15 saying RFRA doesn't apply where that's at stake. Now,

16 what's the argument against that? You're saying the

17 argument against that is, maybe it really isn't a

18 compelling interest? Well, okay. Why not? I mean, it

19 sounds to me as if it would be. They have a Treaty. They

20 have to live up to their word, period. What's wrong with

21 that?

22 MS. HOLLANDER: There's nothing wrong with that,

23 Your Honor. The -- what's wrong with that is that RFRA

24 requires the Government to go further than that.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: It does? All right. That's an

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 issue, I guess. I'd have to decide: Is a compelling and

2 -- does it require the Government to go further? But you

3 concede that if it doesn't require the Government to go

4 further, you lose.

5 MS. HOLLANDER: If the Treaty does include

6 hoasca, which we believe that it doesn't.

7 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, that's a

8 different issue. Why doesn't it?

9 MS. HOLLANDER: Why doesn't it? It doesn't.

10 And the -- and, interestingly, the executive took the

11 reverse position that it's taking here throughout the

12 history of this Treaty until this litigation, and it

13 doesn't cover hoasca, because it doesn't cover plants, or

14 infusions from plants. And that is the position. And the

15 reason why the U.S. would not lose its leadership position

16 is that that's the position of Brazil, which allows

17 religious use --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care whose position it

19 is. The language does not admit of that exception.

20 There's nothing in the language of it that would suggest

21 that exception at all. What language do you rely upon for

22 that exception?

23 MS. HOLLANDER: The Treaty -- we have to rely,

24 Your Honor, on the Treaty as a whole. And what --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: As a whole, anywhere in it --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 give me language anywhere in the whole Treaty that --

2 MS. HOLLANDER: What the --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- suggests that exception.

4 MS. HOLLANDER: The Treaty that the -- the

5 language that suggests that exception is, first of all, in

6 Article 32, that talks about the traditional use of

7 plants. It is in the fact that plants are not covered.

8 And so, a --

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but a --

10 MS. HOLLANDER: -- preparation --

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- solution that includes the

12 substance DMT is covered, by definition, as I understand

13 it. Tea is a solution, and it includes DMT. Isn't that

14 the end of the issue?

15 MS. HOLLANDER: No, Your Honor, it isn't. And

16 the reason it isn't is, if we look -- several places, one

17 is the conduct of our Treaty partners, none of whom agree

18 with that position -- we look at --

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: What's wrong -- can you tell

20 me, on the face of it, what's wrong with it? I mean, I --

21 if I have tea at 5 o'clock, I think I'm drinking a

22 solution that includes the little things that come out of

23 the tea leaves. And that's what we've got involved here.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe our Treaty partners are

25 just violating the Treaty.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. HOLLANDER: Well, Your Honor, if they are,

2 then we are, also --

3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well --

4 MS. HOLLANDER: -- because --

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Tell me what's wrong with the

6 analysis of the solution?

7 MS. HOLLANDER: The --

8 JUSTICE BREYER: I have specific language from

9 the Treaty's commentary in front of me that supports you.

10 Are you not going to read that?

11 [Laughter.]

12 MS. HOLLANDER: I was --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: She's not going to read it,

14 because I asked her for language in the --

15 MS. HOLLANDER: In the Treaty.

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- Treaty. In --

17 MS. HOLLANDER: I was --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the Treaty --

19 MS. HOLLANDER: I --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- not in the legislative

21 history of the Treaty.

22 [Laughter.]

23 MS. HOLLANDER: I was -- I was trying to answer

24 Justice Scalia's question. But let me say this. And of

25 course I would read the language of the commentary and the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 INCB and the opinion of our former ambassador, Herbert

2 Okun, in Brazil and France. But let me also say, if I

3 may, that the position of the executive, until this --

4 until this litigation, has been the same. And the reason

5 we know that is precisely what you said, Your Honor.

6 Mescaline is also covered by the Treaty. Peyote is not.

7 The Native --

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I --

9 MS. HOLLANDER: -- American --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- thought that's

11 because we made a special reservation for peyote.

12 MS. HOLLANDER: No, Mr. Chief Justice. We did

13 make a special reservation, but it didn't matter yet,

14 because it's never been covered. That reservation, if you

15 go back and look at what the Senate said at the time, and

16 what -- there are no plants. They're just not listed in

17 the Treaty. The purpose of the reservation was, in an

18 abundance of caution, in case it would be -- in case it

19 would be added in the future, then plants, and solutions

20 from plants, would be covered. But as it stands now,

21 members of the Native American Church drink a tea

22 containing peyote and --

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, are you --

24 MS. HOLLANDER: -- mescaline.

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- saying that there are --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there's basically an ambiguity in the Treaty, that

2 solutions derived from plants are not covered, but

3 solutions that include DMT are covered, and there --

4 therefore, there is a question?

5 MS. HOLLANDER: The -- yes, the ambiguity arises

6 because what the Treaty means is that if you were to

7 extract the DMT and then add it to something, which can't

8 be done here and could have no religious meaning for the

9 UDV, and we're not even sure if -- chemically, if it's

10 possible. If you were to extract it and then add it, then

11 you would have a solution containing DMT. And that's --

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: But solution is defined by the

13 number of steps in the process that gets the substance

14 into the water? Is that --

15 MS. HOLLANDER: Well -
-

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- correct?


17 MS. HOLLANDER: -- Your Honor, I didn't write 


18 this Treaty, and I -- and I must say --

19 [Laughter.]

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I'm not blaming you --

21 MS. HOLLANDER: -- that it --

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- for it --

23 MS. HOLLANDER: -- that it --

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- but I --

25 MS. HOLLANDER: -- that it --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 [Laughter.]

2 MS. HOLLANDER: It's not the clear -- the

3 clearest writing, but we know -- we know what its meaning

4 is, and we do have to look at the travaux, which goes into

5 long detail about why they even mention plants, because of

6 their fear, in the future, that plants might be covered.

7 Now, other plants are covered --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can --

9 MS. HOLLANDER: -- in a different Treaty. But

10 --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I make a suggestion as to

12 why, even if it is covered by the Treaty, it may not be a

13 compelling State interest to comply with the Treaty?

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Say yes. Let me him make that

15 --

16 MS. HOLLANDER: Yes.


17 [Laughter.]


18 MS. HOLLANDER: I'm just waiting.


19 [Laughter.] 


20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was the right answer.


21 MS. HOLLANDER: I'm just trying -
-

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because I haven't --


23 MS. HOLLANDER: -- to be polite.


24 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it made. I -- I mean, isn't 


25 it well-established that statutes trump treaties, that if

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Congress decides, in a subsequent statute, to ignore a

2 Treaty, it may do so? Now, if this RFRA can trump a

3 statute, it would seem to me, a fortiori, it can trump a

4 Treaty.

5 MS. HOLLANDER: Yes, it can, Your Honor. It can

6 trump the Treaty, and that -- and that is --

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, compliance --

8 MS. HOLLANDER: -- correct.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- with a Treaty is not

10 necessarily a compelling State interest.

11 MS. HOLLANDER: It is not. And -- but we don't

12 even have to go that far, because, if we do the RFRA

13 analysis, the Government must show a compelling interest

14 to the person and, in addition --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, surely --

16 MS. HOLLANDER: -- the --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- surely RFRA doesn't say

18 that you disregard treaties or you disregard statutes in

19 determining what's a compelling interest.

20 MS. HOLLANDER: No. You don't disregard them,

21 Your Honor, but --

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And getting back to the first

23 question that Justice Breyer asked -- and then we got off

24 on what the Treaty really means -- but assuming that the

25 Treaty does prohibit the importation of this substance --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 assuming that -- is there any evidence that the District

2 Court thought that this was a compelling interest?

3 MS. HOLLANDER: Well, the -- no, the District

4 Court --

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: None at all.

6 MS. HOLLANDER: -- analyzed the Treaty

7 differently, and analyzed the Treaty to not apply to

8 hoasca, for all the reasons that are -- that are in his

9 opinion in our brief. And, therefore --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, if we disagree with you on

11 the Treaty, then the appellate court's opinion doesn't

12 really even address the point whether or not this and/or

13 the statute, together, can be a compelling interest.

14 MS. HOLLANDER: That's correct. If you disagree

15 with the District Court on that, then the case should be

16 remanded for it to -- for additional --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know if there isn't a

18 factual question here. I mean, I thought Justice Scalia,

19 if it were to be up to him, did take into account official

20 commentaries to treaties. But maybe he doesn't. Anyway,

21 I take them into account. And I -- and in respect to

22 that, I read this as saying, specifically, that the plants

23 -- it doesn't include the substance if it is a substance

24 clearly distinguished from the substance constituting its

25 active principal -- and the example they give is mimosa

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 root, which contains DMT.

2 MS. HOLLANDER: That's true. And --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: And then, that's also true of

4 the bananas and pineapples, et cetera. And there's a

5 court holding that hoasca's out of it, in France and one

6 in the Netherlands, all of which I think was relevant to a

7 Treaty. All right? Now, the Government has come in with

8 a counterargument and said it clearly does cover, I guess,

9 even mimosa roots, where they are imported solely for the

10 purpose of extracting DMT. Now, what's the response to

11 that?

12 MS. HOLLANDER: The response to that, Your

13 Honor, is that there is no DMT extracted in this case.

14 Although the Government said that in their brief, there is

15 no evidence of that, and it is contrary to the evidence --

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it has to be

17 extracted at some point to be -- to get into -- I'm right

18 here -- to get into the tea, right? It's extracted by the

19 preparation of the tea.

20 MS. HOLLANDER: No, Mr. Chief --

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The plants are not --

22 the plants are not imported, right? Just the tea.

23 MS. HOLLANDER: The tea is imported. But the --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

25 MS. HOLLANDER: -- but the tea is made just like

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you would make tea if you mixed chamomile and mint, and

2 then --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

4 MS. HOLLANDER: -- and then you took the leaves

5 out. What you have --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

7 MS. HOLLANDER: -- in that tea is a collection

8 of a tremendous number of alkaloids. And what the

9 commentary is saying is that you would have to pull this

10 alkaloid out. And that would be a chemical process.

11 There's further -- there's further --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I -- if I could

13 just go back to the point. You're emphasizing that the

14 Treaty doesn't cover the importation of plants. But

15 you're not importing plants, you're --

16 MS. HOLLANDER: That --

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- importing a mixture

18 that must contain the covered hallucinogen or it doesn't

19 have its effect.

20 MS. HOLLANDER: That's correct. However, under

21 the Treaty, it's not -- it's not covered by the Treaty,

22 because it is not separate. If DMT were separated, then

23 it would be covered by the Treaty. And, actually, if you

24 look at the 1988 Treaty, going even farther, and its

25 commentary, the commentary in the 1988 Treaty, which has

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to be read in connection with the 1971 Treaty,

2 specifically defines preparation as the extraction --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, under your --

4 MS. HOLLANDER: -- of the drug.

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- theory, a marijuana

6 tea would not be covered by the Treaty.

7 MS. HOLLANDER: Not by this Treaty. But that --

8 marijuana, coca leaves and poppies are specifically

9 covered by the 1961 Treaty.

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but they're not

11 being imported, they're transformed into this tea. And

12 you -- saying the active substance isn't there

13 independently, so it's not covered. And that seems to me

14 to be a -- an erroneous reading of the Treaty.

15 MS. HOLLANDER: Well, the difference, for

16 example, with marijuana, is that if you look at the 1961

17 Treaty, it says "the plant, all parts of the plant,

18 everything from the plant." It's all covered. What the

19 1971 Treaty did was different. And if you read the 1971

20 Treaty and the 1988 Treaty and their commentaries, if I

21 can rely on their commentaries, and the International

22 Narcotics Control Board, what they are expressing is a

23 concern for the traditional religious and mystical use of

24 plants in religion, and that's what they were concerned

25 about, and that's why they didn't put this in, and that's

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 why they specifically have, in the commentary, that the

2 example of mimosa -- and they also have an example of

3 peyote in the same paragraph 12, where they --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: About commentary or travaux, I

5 don't mind using them for treaties, so long as they don't

6 contradict the Treaty. Do we have any case where we use

7 the -- les travaux preparatoires to actually contradict

8 the language of the Treaty?

9 MS. HOLLANDER: Not to my --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's what, it seems to

11 me, is going on here.

12 MS. HOLLANDER: No, Your Honor, it's not

13 contradicting the Treaty, because the Government is taking

14 this one sentence preparation, and the Government has a

15 definition of it, for this litigation only, that is

16 contrary to the definition in the Treaty the way it is

17 interpreted by the travaux and by the commentary, and by

18 this executive, which means that the executive's position

19 here is really entitled to no deference; because,

20 otherwise, the tea drunk by the Native American Church,

21 the peyote tea, would also be covered.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: But, as -- I understand the

23 Treaty. What the Treaty says is, you can't import

24 substances listed in Schedule 1. Then you look at

25 Schedule 1, and it doesn't say hoasca.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. HOLLANDER: That's --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: It says "DMT." And then it has

3 another -- and, interpreting that, it says the fact, if

4 you look at that list and it says "DMT," means what it

5 says: You can't import DMT. It's a drug importation

6 statute, and it doesn't cover plants that contain the

7 substance DMT. Otherwise, we'd have -- throw out bananas

8 and -- or mimosa, anyway. And we're not looking to intent

9 on that. Now, that's a possible interpretation that

10 doesn't contradict anything. And --

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, except that you

12 don't import the plants, right?

13 MS. HOLLANDER: That's correct. And we don't

14 import DMT. We import a tea that contains an enormous

15 number of alkaloids. And it was clear in --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: You're in trouble. That's

17 harder, then, if it's --

18 MS. HOLLANDER: It was -- it's clear --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, of course, the reason you

20 import it is because it contains this particular

21 substance.

22 [Laughter.]

23 MS. HOLLANDER: That's correct, Your Honor.

24 That is correct. However, the Treaty wanted to be -- the

25 Treaty writers were very careful to not impinge on

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 traditional religious use. And RFRA -- and there's one

2 more thing that I've been trying to say, and that is that

3 RFRA requires not just a compelling interest, but a

4 compelling interest to the person, and it requires least-

5 restrictive means.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you mean by

7 that. You said that before, too.

8 MS. HOLLANDER: Least --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Could you explain that again?

10 You said a compelling interest to the -- what person?

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To the person. To what

12 person?

13 MS. HOLLANDER: To the aggrieved person. To

14 this particular --

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the compelling interest

16 in enforcing it against the aggrieved person. Isn't that

17 what you mean?

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

19 MS. HOLLANDER: That's right. That's correct.

20 But --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay.

22 MS. HOLLANDER: -- but RFRA also requires that

23 the Government prove, if it proves a compelling interest,

24 to enforce it against the person, and if it gets there, it

25 also must prove that it is furthering that compelling

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 interest by the least restrictive means. Now --

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the interest is

3 defined, as Mr. Kneedler did -- that is, these drugs are

4 "No, absolutely prohibited." -- then how can you have any

5 less restrictive means? It seems to me that you can -- I

6 understand your argument about a compelling State interest

7 has to be judged in context -- to the person, to this

8 church. But if Mr. Kneedler is correct that the

9 compelling State interest is that this is a proscribed

10 drug, then there can't be any least restrictive means.

11 MS. HOLLANDER: Well, I disagree, Your Honor.

12 For example, other countries that have domestic policies

13 have found ways to accommodate that have not violated the

14 Treaty. For example, Switzerland provides needles and

15 heroin to its -- to its drug users. And the United States

16 has not objected that this is a violation of the Treaty.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about --

18 MS. HOLLANDER: And --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I worry about the general

20 proposition we would be adopting if we say, you know, one

21 narrow exception is not a -- doesn't contravene a

22 compelling State interest. What about -- I assume there

23 is still a Federal law against bigamy that applies in

24 Federal territories. Now, what if, you know, a small

25 religious group comes forward and said, you know, "We --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 our religion requires bigamy. There are not a whole lot

2 of us. We're just a little tiny group. So, we demand,

3 under RFRA, an exemption from this absolute law. Why does

4 it have to be absolute? It's just a little tiny

5 exception, only a few of us."

6 MS. HOLLANDER: Well --

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: At least for now.

8 [Laughter.]

9 MS. HOLLANDER: Until they reproduce.

10 [Laughter.]

11 MS. HOLLANDER: Your Honor, the analysis would

12 be the same. First, that religion would have to prove it

13 was a sincere religion and meet that burden. And then the

14 Government could come forward with a compelling interest

15 that -- and the -- and perhaps find the same thing that

16 was found in Reynolds, which was not a strict scrutiny

17 case, but may come out the same way -- the sanctity of

18 marriage, the other issues. And those would be issues of

19 fact for a district judge to decide, under his discretion.

20 And it -- all RFRA does is give every religious

21 organization, the minority ones and the majority ones, the

22 opportunity to go into court as an aggrieved person and

23 make their claim and see whether the Government can meet

24 its burden.

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a question? It's

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 a bit tangential just a little bit, but going back to the

2 Chief Justice's question earlier about diversion? And his

3 suggestion was, if they're -- proselyte the religion, you

4 get all sorts of converts who will just use it in the same

5 way as the small number use it now. Would that be

6 diversion, or would it be diversion -- diverting it to

7 some people who are not members of the religion?

8 MS. HOLLANDER: Well --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: What does the word "diversion"

10 mean in this context?

11 MS. HOLLANDER: "Diversion," Your Honor, is a

12 term of art here. And I thought I answered it that way,

13 but maybe I was unclear. It means diversion from licit

14 use to illicit use. So, it's --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but then, getting more

16 members to -- converted to the religion would not be

17 diversion.

18 MS. HOLLANDER: No, it would not be diversion.

19 There would only be a problem if the Government, for

20 example, showed --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.

22 MS. HOLLANDER: -- that there was some diversion

23 outside. And that's why I used the example of the Native

24 American Church; there's never been any diversion.

25 I'd like to go back to one other issue that

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 perhaps I didn't make clear. What the -- it's true that

2 the UDV does not import the plants. But it's those plants

3 that are sacred to the UDV. It can't substitute them.

4 Not only is DMT in bananas and pineapple, but Phalaris

5 grass, for example, that -- and there's a picture of one

6 in our joint appendix at about page 518, I believe --

7 grows in this country. A recreational user could just go

8 and, you know, mix the Phalaris --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but --

10 MS. HOLLANDER: -- grass.

11 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I don't see -- I mean, I see

12 I was not right. You do import drums of tea. And they

13 say, in the Treaty, that a preparation is a solution or

14 mixture containing a substance. And it would seem to be a

15 solution or a mixture containing DMT. And the commentary

16 that I thought helped you does concern plants, but you're

17 not importing plants. So, now I'm rather troubled to see

18 if there is any way that this Treaty is interpreted in a

19 manner that allows you to win. What is it?

20 MS. HOLLANDER: Well, the -- what the commentary

21 says is that it is not a covered preparation, that an

22 infusion or tea made from the roots of a plant is not a

23 covered preparation, and that --

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Hollander, may I just, on

25 this point -- it's the same question I raised with Mr.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Kneedler. We're talking about a preliminary injunction.

2 Your side, I think, said, "Go for the permanent

3 injunction. We have a lot more to put in." The

4 presentation on the Treaty was rather thin, below. I take

5 it from Mr. Kneedler's argument that he's saying the

6 preliminary injunction, or not, is really the thing. If

7 the Government wins, no preliminary injunction. There's

8 not going to be any show for a permanent injunction. But,

9 on your side of it, what more would you be putting in?

10 Let's say you prevail at the preliminary injunction stage.

11 Would you then say, "See, Judge, now you can enter a

12 permanent injunction"? Or you -- would you be putting in

13 more evidence? And if so, what kind?

14 MS. HOLLANDER: Well, we certainly have a great

15 deal of more evidence, Your Honor, that we can put in. We

16 have substantial evidence on the Treaty, and evidence we

17 haven't even talked about here, proving that this hoasca

18 is not covered by the Treaty. We have additional health

19 and safety evidence. We have additional evidence to show

20 lack of diversion. We have additional evidence that Judge

21 Parker talks about to show targeting of the religion and

22 selective prosecution. We have a great deal more evidence

23 we can put on. But, of course, it depends on what the

24 Government puts on. Because, at this point, the

25 Government has not met any of its burdens.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Now, you're correct about the Treaty. None of

2 that has gone on. The Government resisted any evidence

3 about the Treaty, resisted the very best evidence, which

4 was the International Narcotics Control Board's opinion

5 that hoasca is not covered by the Treaty. And we now have

6 -- we now have more that we would put on.

7 And, you know, what the church and its members

8 seek is just the right to practice their religious faith,

9 as Congress guaranteed them in RFRA. Because Congress

10 guaranteed and recognized that religious liberty is a core

11 value in this country. Two courts below found, on a

12 lengthy factual record, that the Government had not met

13 the burdens Congress imposed. This Court should do --

14 even if this Court believes that it's a close question --

15 should do then what it did in Ashcroft v. ACLU, affirm the

16 preliminary injunction, remand this case for a trial on

17 the merits.

18 If this Court were to do anything less than

19 that, it's really to deny Congress's intent and Congress's

20 policy here, because Congress's policy is that religious

21 freedom, religious liberty, shall not be burdened unless,

22 and until, the Government meets its burdens. The District

23 Court clearly found, and said, that the Government did not

24 show a risk of harm, did not show a risk of diversion;

25 and, therefore, he found that the Government did not meet

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 its compelling interests in this case. And we would ask

2 the Court to affirm the preliminary injunction, remand

3 this case to the District Court.

4 Thank you.

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.

6 Hollander.

7 Mr. Kneedler, you have 4 minutes left.

8 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

9 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

10 MR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

11 If I may focus first on the question of

12 importation, no country in the world would permit the

13 exportation and importation of preparations that contain a

14 substance listed under the Convention, because the express

15 words of the -- of the Convention prohibit it. And the

16 commentary that is cited does -- all it says it that

17 plants, as such, are not covered. The plants themselves

18 are not included in the schedule. It then has footnotes

19 describing how the plants may be used, how -- in a mixture

20 or a solution that contain the DMT or some other subject.

21 And that's precisely the sort of thing that the

22 Convention was designed to prohibit. And --

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what -- but what

24 does that benefit you? I mean -- I guess this is Justice

25 Scalia's question he asked earlier -- the Treaty is -- it

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 seems to me if you're willing to override a duly enacted

2 statute, the Treaty shouldn't have any greater status.

3 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I don't think RFRA does

4 override it. What RFRA does is take the compelling

5 interests that the Government already has in enacted laws

6 or treaties, as they are, and then you apply -- you apply

7 RFRA to them. And that's --

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think the Treaty

9 gives you a more compelling governmental interest than the

10 Controlled Substances Act?

11 MR. KNEEDLER: I certainly do. And the two

12 together, I think, are doubly compelling, because the

13 Government -- the United States has a compelling interest

14 in encouraging this, and section 801(a) --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: More than doubly. It has to be

16 doubly, plus a little, if you said that one is even more

17 than the other.

18 [Laughter.]

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's okay.

20 MR. KNEEDLER: But Congress itself, in the

21 statute implementing this Convention, said it is essential

22 to have international cooperation in the protection of the

23 -- of the drugs covered by the statute. So, you have a

24 statutory determination that this is critical, anyway.

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, we have to agree

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

54
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 with you, though, that our Treaty partners in this area

2 have, sort of, a zero-tolerance approach to enforcing the

3 Treaty.

4 MR. KNEEDLER: No, not at all. First, the

5 United -- as a general matter, of course, the United

6 States has a compelling interest in living up to its

7 treaties. But, under this Treaty, in particular, the

8 United States has to be in a position to go to other

9 countries, maybe countries that are dragging their feet

10 about whether to take enforcement measures, and say, "You

11 have an obligation to strictly construe this Convention."

12 And if they are able to come back and say that you have -

13 - you, yourselves, have not been doing that, that

14 undermines the ability of the United States in enforcing a

15 Treaty designed to prohibit international trafficking in

16 controlled substances. And nothing in this Court's first

17 amendment cases would have suggested that there is a free-

18 exercise right --

19 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's actually why I've

20 been looking. I'm bothered by it, because it -- if the

21 Treaty is absolute, we reserve for peyote, which would

22 mean the religious use of peyote by the Native American

23 tribes is exempt, but other people who have identical

24 religions, use identical substances, they're stuck. And

25 that, it seems to me, is a rather rough problem under the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

55
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 First Amendment.

2 MR. KNEEDLER: Well --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: One religion singled out. And,

4 therefore, I'm looking for some way in this Treaty not to

5 reach that conclusion --

6 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, with --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: -- for the constitutional

8 reason.

9 MR. KNEEDLER: -- with respect to peyote, the

10 Convention does not allow the importation or exportation

11 or international trafficking in any substance that there

12 is a reservation taken for. It is a reservation only for

13 the domestic use of plants that are native to that

14 country. So, peyote cannot be exported or imported under

15 this -- under this Convention. And so, the idea -- so,

16 there's nothing inconsistent with respect to the

17 fundamental threshold question of importation, but, even

18 so, we think, in Congress's specific Indian power, that

19 that -- that that could be different.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. --

21 MR. KNEEDLER: The --

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Kneedler, if you prevail,

23 would there be anything left over to be argued about in

24 the -- for permanent injunction?

25 MR. KNEEDLER: No. In our view, on the -- on

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

56
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the legal -- now, on our principal submission, no, there

2 would not be anything further, because under -- in our

3 view, there's a categorical prohibition against Schedule 1

4 substances. That is the compelling interest. The

5 question, then, is whether -- as this Court said in Lee,

6 and as Justice O'Connor said in her concurring opinion in

7 Smith, the question is whether an exception would unduly

8 interfere with carrying out that interest, or whether it

9 would be a least effective -- less effective means, in

10 terms of being less effective. And we think there's no

11 question that any exception to a categorical bar would

12 violate that standard.

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.

14 The case is submitted.

16 above-entitled matter was submitted.]
