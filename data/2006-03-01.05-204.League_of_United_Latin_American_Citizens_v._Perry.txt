2 (1:00 p.m.)

4 next in No. 05-204, League of United Latin American

5 Citizens v. Perry, and the consolidated cases.

6 Mr. Smith.

7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

8 ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 05-276

9 MR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11 The Texas legislature passed a new

12 congressional districting map in 2003 for only one

13 reason: maximizing the number of Republicans who would

14 represent the State of Texas in Congress. Even though

15 the existing lawful map already had 20 of 32 districts

16 which strongly favored the Republicans, lawmakers went

17 to extraordinary lengths to lock in control of 22

18 districts, moving around 8 million people into new

19 districts, abandoning concerns about compactness,

20 wherever necessary, and most importantly, segregating

21 the population by race and by politics into 32

22 districts which are extremely noncompetitive.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your -- your

24 statement that it was for one reason only means it

25 wasn't for any discriminatory reason on the grounds of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 race or ethnicity?

2 MR. SMITH: Your Honor, the finding of the

3 district court, which we're relying on here, was that

4 it was purely for discrimination based on partisanship

5 rather than on the basis of race.

6 Now, they started out by trying to engineer

7 the defeat in the -- in the legislative process,

8 engineer the defeat of the six Democratic Congressmen

9 who had managed to be elected in Republican-leaning

10 districts because they were moderate to conservative

11 and they were, as the district court put it, able to

12 appeal to voters to split their tickets and vote for

13 them in 2002.

14 By the end of the legislative process, they

15 went further and decided to take the risk of

16 eliminating one of only four districts in the State in

17 which African Americans had an opportunity to elect

18 candidates of their choice and also to eliminate one of

19 the Hispanic opportunity districts in south Texas.

20 Now, in the latter case, they did try to replace that

21 with another Hispanic opportunity district, but that

22 was the one that we've called the land bridge district,

23 District 25, which spans 300 miles, linking up urban

24 concentrations of Latinos in Austin and in McAllen down

25 on the Mexican border.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think that's no good.

2 MR. SMITH: Your Honor, we --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not even to prevent

4 retrogression, which would violate section 5.

5 MR. SMITH: Your Honor, the retrogression

6 problem was created by the fact that they had gotten

7 rid of a much more natural -- naturally occurring --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that was done for

9 political reasons, not racial reasons.

10 MR. SMITH: Exactly, Your Honor, and that's

11 the argument that was made and rejected expressly by

12 this Court in Bush v. Vera, that we had to make an ugly

13 minority district rather than a compact minority

14 district because if we did it the other way, a nearby

15 incumbent would lose his seat. That was precisely the

16 argument that was made there, that it was really

17 incumbency protection, and we had to make it this ugly

18 district to send that excessive racial message in order

19 to protect other nearby incumbents, an argument which

20 is mirrored here exactly and -- and as to which I

21 notice the -- the State of Texas offers no response.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: But what -- what is your

23 proposal? What -- what is -- what is a State to do if

24 -- assuming there is a political motivation in drawing

25 its districts, perfectly valid political motivation

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 let's assume, and the result of that redrawing is that

2 it would eliminate a majority minority district, what

3 -- what is the State supposed to do?

4 MR. SMITH: I think the State has to stay

5 within the constitutional confines of the Shaw v. Reno

6 doctrine which would require it not to go so far in the

7 pursuit of its political agenda that it creates a

8 district -- has to -- has to create a minority

9 opportunity district somewhere that would otherwise

10 violate Shaw.

11 Now --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what's the -- I'm -- as

13 Justice Scalia, I'm interested in the section 25

14 problem. The briefs --

15 MR. SMITH: District.

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- for your co-counsel

17 don't talk much about it, and it's -- it's a problem

18 for me.

19 Justice Scalia's point was let's assume --

20 and I have some doubt about it. Let's assume that

21 there's a valid reason for redoing section 23. That

22 means you need another district to avoid retrogression.

23 What is -- what is your position as to district 25 on

24 that assumption, based on that assumption?

25 MR. SMITH: I don't think that it makes a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 constitutional difference under this Court's cases

2 whether or not the reason they decided to place the

3 district there and give it that configuration was

4 because they had a political agenda somewhere else.

5 The -- the fact of the matter is they -- they were

6 deliberately trying to create an Hispanic majority

7 district there, and to do it, they had to go all the

8 way up to Austin and grab 300,000 Latinos and link them

9 up with --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely, that's not what

11 makes it bad. Even if they created a compact district

12 but with the -- with the intent of creating a majority

13 minority district, that would be a district created for

14 a racial reason. The mere fact that this one happens

15 to be not compact doesn't eliminate the motivation, and

16 -- and I don't see how you can avoid that motivation

17 unless you're going to abandon the -- the prohibition

18 against regression.

19 MR. SMITH: Our point, Your Honor, is that in

20 this situation, doing it this way, the -- the

21 motivation predominates over the other legitimate

22 districting criteria, which I think under Bush and

23 under --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which -- which

25 motivation?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SMITH: Well, the -- the racial

2 motivation to create a district -- to -- to reach out

3 as far as they did to capture --

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, can the -- can the

5 State by its action with one district, i.e., 23, in

6 effect bootstrap itself in a position where it's

7 entitled to use race where -- in a -- in a predominant

8 and I -- I think insulting way and -- and then have a

9 defense?

10 MR. SMITH: Our submission is that they

11 cannot, Your Honor.

12 Now, if I could turn to the partisanship

13 issue, our --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: May I just clarify one thing

15 on that?

16 MR. SMITH: Sure.

17 JUSTICE BREYER: I take it your reason was

18 that in Bush v. Vera, the Court said, of course, they

19 can use race to prevent retrogression. Of course, they

20 can, but if they do, they have to create a compact

21 majority minority district, not an elongated majority

22 --

23 MR. SMITH: Yes.

24 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the -- that's the

25 argument. I have to go back and look at Bush v. Vera.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, and that they

2 can't say we have to create it in a non-compact way

3 where the race predominates over the other values

4 because we have a political agenda of protecting some

5 other incumbent in a non-minority district.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- how does that

7 make any sense to say that what you're objecting to is

8 the consideration of race in one situation, but if it's

9 compact and the predominant motive was the

10 consideration of race, that doesn't bother you? That

11 seems to me to be a back-door way to get into a more

12 extensive judicial review of the compactness and based

13 on racial considerations that are, under your view, the

14 predominant factor in each case.

15 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I think there's

16 a question of what you mean by the word predominance.

17 And I as understand the Court's cases, there are times

18 when the shape and the extra efforts that are made to

19 -- to kind of gather up minority voters as, for

20 example, in Miller v. Johnson where we had a very

21 similar district, where race is said to predominate in

22 a different sense than it does when you simply are

23 creating a minority district to avoid retrogression or

24 to -- to stay in compliance with the Voting Rights Act.

25 Clearly, the Voting Rights Act requires you

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to create minority districts. It should require that

2 it makes sense that people make efforts to do that.

3 We're not saying you shouldn't do any of those things.

4 We're just saying in this instance, under this Court's

5 cases, you shouldn't be able to use your political

6 agenda to allow you and justify you to do it in a

7 different way which sends this extra message of

8 excessive racial consideration.

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's a --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you can take race

11 into account if it's compact as a predominant motive.

12 You can't take race into account if it's not compact.

13 MR. SMITH: I think, Your Honor, you

14 certainly can --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As a dominant motive.

16 MR. SMITH: You certainly can intentionally

17 create a minority district under section 2 of the

18 Voting Rights Act. I don't know how you could comply

19 with section 2 of the Voting Rights Act if you don't do

20 that in situations where, under the Gingles criteria,

21 that's what you're supposed to do.

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask? I'm a little

23 puzzled by the -- the questioning. Doesn't everyone

24 agree that the predominant motive in all the districts

25 was political? You agree to that, don't you?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: And you don't agree that

3 that necessarily makes it valid, that that's

4 necessarily a defense to section 2.

5 MR. SMITH: No, I actually don't agree with

6 that, Your Honor, and you're right.

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: And -- and the problem with

8 section -- with district 23, under section 2 of the

9 Voting Rights Act, is not the motivation. It's the

10 results that have changed. Isn't that correct?

11 MR. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor.

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the question under the

13 district court's opinion is whether the political

14 motive was an adequate defense to what would otherwise

15 be a violation of section 2. Is that correct?

16 MR. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't it

18 correct, though, that a result is -- focus on results

19 is not sufficient if the challenge is an equal

20 protection one and not a section 2 one?

21 MR. SMITH: Right, but -- but our challenge

22 under the Equal Protection Clause --

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm talking about

24 district 25.

25 MR. SMITH: It's a little hard to keep all

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the different arguments straight, but yes. Our

2 argument is based on intent there, yes, Your Honor.

3 And -- and the argument is that the intent went too far

4 because they had to --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's why I

6 asked earlier that your -- your statement that all of

7 this was done with a political motive -- I wondered how

8 that satisfied the equal protection requirement, not

9 the section 2 requirement.

10 MR. SMITH: Well, I think there are

11 situations in which you have a political motive

12 overarching the entire map, and that -- but at the same

13 time, that pushes you to do some things which could

14 violate the Fourteenth Amendment in terms of racial

15 conduct. And that's what this -- that's what our

16 argument is --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you don't think that's

18 a defense. It seems to me the State creates the very

19 problem that it claims that it must use race to settle.

20 MR. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor, yes.

21 We don't think it's a defense in this instance.

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Now, with respect to section

23 2, what is -- what is your position on the relationship

24 between the predominant political motivation and the

25 existence and nonexistence of a section 2 violation?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SMITH: Your Honor, if I understand the

2 question, I -- if the question is is it permissible to

3 have --

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- let me put it another

5 way.

6 MR. SMITH: Okay.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if you otherwise

8 demonstrate a section 2 violation, is the political

9 motivation a defense?

10 MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor.

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: No.

12 MR. SMITH: Certainly not.

13 Now, we have a -- an argument about that too,

14 which has to do with the district in the Dallas-Fort

15 Worth area, and I think the political defense there

16 doesn't have anything to do with it.

17 Now, if -- if I could, I think that the whole

18 map -- the decision to redraw the whole map violates

19 the Equal Protection Clause for a wholly different

20 reason, which was that it was wholly lacking in any

21 rational, legitimate public purpose. At the time,

22 there was a lawful map in place that had the right

23 number of districts, and the district court found as

24 fact that the only reason that this law was even

25 considered, let alone passed, was to help one political

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 party gain more seats in the Congress at the expense of

2 the other.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about having a --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wow. That's a surprise.

5 (Laughter.)

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about having a -- a

7 plan that was put in place by the legislature instead

8 of a temporary plan put in effect by a court?

9 MR. SMITH: The --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't there -- isn't it --

11 you -- you seem to treat this as a redone redistricting

12 instead of as the very first redistricting done by a

13 legislature.

14 MR. SMITH: It was the first one done by the

15 legislature because they violated the Constitution

16 intentionally when they had an obligation to -- to draw

17 a map 2 years earlier. Our submission is that the

18 existence of some power that the legislature may have

19 to -- to alter the remedial map -- and they may well

20 have that power. We don't -- we don't question that --

21 doesn't justify the map. They still have to, in

22 exercising that power, point to some constitutional

23 basis for which they're acting.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which -- but it's a

25 perfectly constitutional basis to alter the map because

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 we don't think it allocates the seats in the fashion

2 that our political power enables us to -- to provide

3 for. Legislatures redraw the maps all the time for

4 political reasons. I mean, to say that this is, you

5 know, something horrible is ridiculous. You

6 acknowledge that political motivation is fine.

7 MR. SMITH: Your Honor, we --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you?

9 MR. SMITH: -- we acknowledge that we

10 tolerate political motivation in the context of map-

11 drawing when there's other legitimate public purposes

12 being served, which is to say at the beginning of the

13 decade when they have to redraw the map anyway.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: I see.

15 MR. SMITH: But our position is when it's

16 purely for partisan motivation, which is -- only occurs

17 in mid-decade --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even -- even when the map is

19 so distorted -- you -- you acknowledge that the map that came

20 out, after this -- this realignment of districts, had

21 less of a divergence between the voting strength of the

22 Republican Party and the number of Republican seats

23 than had existed under the previous allocation by the

24 Democrats.

25 MR. SMITH: That -- that is not, we believe,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 a justification for two reasons, Your Honor. This

2 notion that you can have compensatory gerrymandering

3 and that that can be your justification -- I think it's

4 wrong as a matter of law because all it amounts to is

5 another way of saying we like -- we don't like the

6 partisan composition of the delegation that the people

7 voted for and we're going to change it.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm saying less. Less.

9 It -- there's less of a divergence under the new map

10 than there was under the old one. The only difference

11 is this divergence is in favor of the majority.

12 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, as the district

13 court found -- and this is on page 85 of our

14 jurisdictional statement appendix -- it wasn't that

15 there was bias in the map that the court drew. It was

16 that there were 20 of 32 districts that strongly

17 favored the Republicans in the court-drawn map. It

18 just so happened that the voters in those districts, in

19 six of those Republican-leaning districts, happened to

20 like voting for moderate to conservative Democrats who

21 they were comfortable with. Now, if you tell me -- I

22 -- I find difficulty -- I find it difficult to

23 understand how anyone could say the legislature can, as

24 a matter of -- use the machinery of government to

25 decide that those voters should not have that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 opportunity to do that again, that that was a mistake.

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, counsel, just

3 take it in -- in an abstract way. If you think that

4 the prior system has been gerrymandered by the party in

5 power, are you saying that when that shift in power in

6 the statewide offices changes, that the new party in

7 power cannot redress the gerrymandering of its

8 predecessor?

9 MR. SMITH: My -- my answers to that are

10 twofold. I think as a matter of law that the Court

11 should hold that -- if that's the only justification,

12 you ought to wait until you have other public purposes

13 for redrawing the lines.

14 But even if that were -- even if the Court is

15 going to allow that kind of justification for mid-decade

16 redistricting, it shouldn't allow it here because it

17 was just factually untrue, as the district court found.

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but let's get back to

19 the -- to the principle without just talking about

20 these -- these factfindings. It -- it seems to me

21 very odd for you to be telling us that partisan

22 gerrymandering is -- is improper when that's the sole

23 or substantial, predominant motivation, but then saying

24 that we can't correct it when it's happened.

25 Let's assume that the 1990 legislative plan

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 was one that was done with -- without a wholly partisan

2 intent, but over the years, it -- it now freezes in the

3 Democrats or party X to having a much greater advantage

4 than the general registration would give it. And if it

5 leaves it in for a particularly partisan purpose, why

6 -- why can't it be redone?

7 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I think that if

8 the Court --

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just don't understand

10 that argument.

11 MR. SMITH: I think it's a dangerous thing to

12 do, to say to the legislatures of the country you can't

13 redistrict for partisan gain, but if you can recouch it

14 as partisan compensation, that's okay.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me give you

16 another parallel. Let's suppose that districts have

17 been gerrymandered for racially discriminatory purposes

18 for years. Can you take race into account in drawing

19 new districts to remedy that racial discrimination?

20 MR. SMITH: I think if a map is illegal, Your

21 Honor, then -- then certainly it is within the power of

22 -- of the legislature to --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, that's -- but now,

24 in fairness, I think to the red brief argument --

25 you've read the red briefs.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SMITH: I have, Your Honor.

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. They are filled with

3 factual information that in their opinion shows that

4 previously the Democrats had gerrymandered this much

5 worse, and that what -- this was an effort to create a

6 balance. That's what their view is. Now, I want to

7 know really precisely what is your response to that

8 argument.

9 MR. SMITH: My response is -- is -- factual

10 response is that by the time we got to 2002, the

11 district court's drawn map had 20 of 32 districts,

12 which voted overwhelmingly Republican for every other

13 office, in the range of 60 to 70 percent, so that

14 whatever bias was introduced into the map in 1991, if

15 there was one, had been eradicated because all of these

16 Democrats in those districts had become more

17 Republican. And so the map was not biased. There was

18 nothing wrong with the lines.

19 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what do I look to in

20 the record to verify what you just said?

21 MR. SMITH: You look to the court's finding

22 on page 85 which said that 20 of 32 districts favored

23 the Republicans. And you look at the expert reports

24 filed by both sides at the trial that preceded that

25 finding, and the experts for both sides said that the

1 court-drawn map was a pro-Republican map that favored

2 the Republicans or, at minimum, was fair, and that with

3 the kind of voting patterns that existed in Texas at

4 the time, one would expect the Republicans to carry 20

5 districts in most of the elections.

6 Now, they also said -- and -- and this is a

7 reason why the State didn't actually put their expert

8 on the stand -- that the map that the legislature had

9 drawn instead was wildly biased in favor of the

10 Republicans in that at 52 percent of the vote, they

11 would still get 22 districts, and at 50 percent of the

12 vote, they'd still get 20 districts.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but what percentage did

14 they have? I -- I thought that -- you say that they

15 should have gotten 20 districts, and how many districts

16 did the plan give them?

17 MR. SMITH: The plan gave them 20 districts

18 in which they had a strong Republican majority. Now,

19 what that means is that --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you say that's what they

21 should have had, given -- given the voting in the

22 State.

23 MR. SMITH: I say they -- that given that

24 opportunity to have 20 districts elect Congressmen,

25 that's -- that's all that anybody could reasonably ask

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 for. That's the only kind of justification that I can

2 even imagine justifying purely partisan redistricting

3 in mid-decade.

4 The fact of the matter is the large majority

5 of the Members of Congress who went to Washington after

6 the 2002 election were elected by Republicans in

7 Republican districts. That's what the facts are. Now,

8 they say, well, vestiges of the past gerrymander are

9 still around, but what does that mean? The fact is the

10 districts are by now overwhelmingly Republican in the

11 large majority of cases.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any -- any

13 authority either in the text of the Constitution or in

14 a -- a case for the proposition that the only reason a

15 legislature can reapportion its districts is because

16 there's been a census?

17 MR. SMITH: Our -- our position is slightly

18 different.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that's your

20 position when you said mid-decade redistricting is bad

21 because your -- your position is the only reason is the

22 census is -- has -- has caused there to be less than --

23 than one man/one vote.

24 MR. SMITH: There may be cases where you

25 could do mid-decade redistricting for neutral,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 legitimate public purposes. I submit they'll be quite

2 rare in -- in practice, but there certainly could be.

3 Our position is you can't redraw the lines

4 purely for partisan gain, and the case I would point to

5 that I think most strongly speaks to that is Cox v.

6 Larios. In that case, the district court found that

7 population deviations, sufficiently small that they

8 weren't even usually requiring justifications, didn't

9 pass the rational basis test because the only

10 explanation you could offer for those deviations was

11 that they were systematically attempting to help the

12 Democrats at the expense of the Republicans.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but are you saying --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if you say that mid-

15 decennial districting is suspect or subject to some

16 special rules, then it seems to me that you're --

17 you're taking away a very important deterrent that

18 works on legislatures when they do decennial

19 districting. If you know as a legislature, when you do

20 a decennial districting, that your program is going to

21 be presumptively valid or not subject to partisan

22 gerrymandering, then -- then you're -- then you're

23 liable to overreach. And it -- it seems to me very

24 dangerous for this Court to take away that control

25 mechanism that exists so that legislatures know that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there's a possibility that if they overreach, they can

2 be corrected.

3 MR. SMITH: That -- that might be a concern,

4 Your Honor. I don't think the -- the historical

5 practice supports it because the fact is that while

6 there's been a fair amount of partisan redistricting,

7 whatever one wants to call it, in the last several

8 decades, there have been precious few, if any, examples

9 of anybody trying to convene the legislature before the

10 next census to try to fix it. It is extraordinarily

11 rare. And the reason for it is we -- there's a general

12 tradition we've established in this country that

13 whatever happens when those lines get drawn, even if

14 it's done by a court, you leave it alone until the next

15 time --

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there was no --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that little -- even

18 if it's done by the court. I like the way you slipped

19 that in. I mean, even if you had a general rule that

20 you cannot redistrict except after a decennial census,

21 surely there ought to be an exception unless -- which

22 -- which would read, unless the districting you're

23 living under was never decreed by the legislature, but

24 was decreed by a court. And that was the situation

25 here. Surely, that's a good reason, even if you

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 adopted your general proposition.

2 MR. SMITH: The -- the reason I -- I slipped

3 it in is that in my description of what I think is the

4 current tradition, Your Honor, is we went and looked

5 and found how many court-drawn congressional district

6 maps have there been in this country in the last 40

7 years, and how many times were they redrawn by the

8 legislature. And the answer is that if you go back

9 between 1970 and 2000, there were 36 of them, and only

10 two of them were redrawn in very small, technical ways,

11 one in Hawaii where they only have two districts and

12 then the one in Texas, which was changed in Dallas.

13 It's not --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'd say that's a shame

15 for the democratic process. I -- I don't like the idea

16 that -- that there are a lot of districts out there

17 that have never been drawn by the people, which is what

18 the Constitution envisions.

19 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, the other thing

20 I think about this -- this argument about that we have

21 this -- this need to have a legislative plan is you

22 invite an abuse of a different kind. If you -- if you

23 say to the legislature, you can sit on your hands at

24 the time when you have an undisputed constitutional

25 obligation to redraw the lines at the beginning of --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of the decade, as long -- and you'll know that what

2 that will do is it will give you the right to come

3 along anytime you feel like it when you get your

4 political ducks --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that the reason

6 these lines were not redrawn at the beginning of the

7 decade, because the majority party sat on its hands?

8 MR. SMITH: That's absolutely what happened

9 here, Your Honor. They didn't make any serious efforts

10 to redo it. The only person --

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought --

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I thought there -- the

14 houses were divided. One party, one -- had one house;

15 the other, the other. And so they were at loggerheads

16 and they --

17 MR. SMITH: The reality is -- and the record

18 -- there was discussion of this at trial by Senator

19 Ratliffe -- there was not very serious effort to do

20 this at the time. The only person who can call a

21 special session -- and it does take special sessions in

22 Texas to get these lines drawn historically -- is the

23 Governor. He declined to call any special sessions

24 when they -- when they had a divided legislature. Of

25 course, 2 years later, when they had unilateral control

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of the whole legislature, we were calling special

2 sessions like mad to get the job done. So --

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the court -- even from

4 the court's perspective, was it the same three judges

5 that did the -- that did the plan, the court-ordered

6 plan? And I thought that the -- the judge who presided

7 told us in his latest opinion that they never

8 anticipated that as being a permanent plan, and indeed,

9 they tried to stay as close as they could to the then-

10 existing plan.

11 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, there was some

12 language to that effect. If you go back, though, and

13 read the opinion that the -- the judges wrote in -- in

14 2001 when they actually were describing in meticulous

15 detail their process of drawing the map, he

16 specifically said then that they didn't follow the old

17 lines, that they used neutral criteria like compactness

18 and following political subdivisions, and that they --

19 this was not an effort to -- to come up with a map that

20 matched the old map.

21 The only thing that I think really fairly can

22 be said about the court-drawn map is it did give a

23 separate district to all of the incumbents, which is

24 what you'd expect a court to do. They're not going to

25 sit around and decide mutual incumbents ought to have

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to run against each other. And so it did have that

2 effect, I think, of allowing some incumbency advantage

3 to continue on.

4 But it is -- it is not true that the -- that

5 the court tried to keep some pattern in the map beyond

6 that. The court specifically said otherwise in 2001

7 when it drew the map, and then it said in --

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we're not -- we're

9 not trying the court for a bad intent. We're looking

10 at the effect of what it's done, and if the effect of

11 what it's done is to leave in place something that's

12 slanted based on -- on statewide registration in favor

13 of the Democrats, then -- then, it seems to me, there's

14 -- there's a ground for the new legislature to act.

15 And -- and one -- one reason legislatures may

16 not have redrawn plans often is because they always

17 protect incumbents.

18 MR. SMITH: But, Your Honor, the facts are

19 that it wasn't slanted. The facts are the experts both

20 testified from both sides at the trial that the map was

21 fair to both parties and that it contained 20

22 Republican districts. And that's what the court found

23 too in 2004. Then we have an appeal and we go back

24 down on remand, and suddenly we're starting to hear

25 about vestiges of gerrymanders. But the court didn't

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 withdraw its finding of fact that there were 20

2 Republican districts in its own map.

3 That's true. I mean, look at the way the

4 votes were cast in 2002. There were 20 Republican

5 districts in the map. The six districts that these

6 Democrats represented who they -- who they -- the

7 moderate Democrats that they were targeting -- the

8 average vote for statewide office in that district was

9 something like 65 percent -- 55 to 65 percent for the

10 Republican candidate.

11 I -- I looked, for example, yesterday at the

12 -- there was an election for the Attorney General in

13 Texas in 2002. It was an open seat, two -- two non-

14 incumbents running against each other, two people from

15 Austin. And the average vote for the Republican

16 Attorney General candidate, Mr. Cruz's boss, in that

17 election in those six districts was 62 percent for him

18 and 38 percent for the -- the Democrat. So these were

19 not Democratic districts. This was not a gerrymander

20 in any rational use of the word.

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Smith, may -- may I ask

22 you to comment on -- on one problem that I have with

23 your position that has nothing whatever to do with the

24 -- with the fact that there was a -- a judicial

25 redrawing in the first place here?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 If I understand your argument, you're saying

2 that a -- a districting that takes place prior to the

3 report of a new decennial census, which is done for

4 purely political reasons, maximizing political

5 advantage, is invalid for that reason, I guess under

6 the Equal Protection Clause.

7 MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: And yet, I take it it's also

9 your position that if the districting is done in

10 response to the new decennial figures so that there's a

11 need to do something to conform to one person/one vote,

12 that there is nothing illegitimate about political

13 motivation, at least up to some point --

14 MR. SMITH: Right.

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- in -- in drawing the

16 lines at that time.

17 How can we in principle say that the

18 motivation which is legitimate in 1991 is somehow

19 constitutionally illegitimate and dispositive in 1995?

20 MR. SMITH: It seems to me that one is not

21 saying that it's legitimate in 1991. One is saying

22 that in redistricting, which is a messy process, we

23 tolerate a lot of mixed motives. We tolerate some

24 consideration of race. We -- we ask for some

25 consideration of race. We tolerate some consideration

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of politics. But that is dramatically different under

2 the rational basis test from a law that is passed

3 solely for political reasons because it doesn't have

4 the other kinds of interests that are being promoted

5 and protected in -- at the beginning of the decade.

6 And so there's a drastic difference, it seems to me,

7 under the rational basis analysis between a law which

8 serves a lot of purposes, some governmental and public,

9 some of them private, and -- and not legitimate bases

10 for governmental action.

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're making the

12 assumption that a mid-decennial districting is not

13 interested in compactness, it's not interested in

14 counties, it's not interested in keeping a university

15 within one -- within one district. That's -- that's

16 just simply not true.

17 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, the -- the fact

18 here is that the only reason they decided to change was

19 for partisanship. That's what the district court found

20 as a matter of fact.

21 Now, the other legal requirements of -- of

22 the map that are -- give you the -- the legitimate

23 bases for redrawing the lines at the beginning of the

24 decade were already satisfied because such a map

25 already existed. And as this Court said in -- in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Growe, the -- the court-drawn map, in some sense,

2 changes the status quo. You have to say what are the

3 additional governmental interests that are -- that

4 exist and justify going through this process again and

5 changing that map, which already is fully lawful, has

6 been affirmed by this -- this Court as lawful.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: But your answer, both to the

8 Justice Kennedy and -- and to me, ultimately comes

9 down, I guess, to saying that political partisanship

10 alone, undiluted, unadulterated by any other

11 motivations, is per se wrong.

12 MR. SMITH: It's -- it's not a basis that can

13 justify public conduct, State action. If -- if it was,

14 then it would be perfectly okay, I suppose, to have

15 government subsidies for some parties and not for

16 others, or to have -- let some people use public

17 facilities and not others.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Let's -- let's

19 assume that the -- that the partisans who do the mid-

20 term redistricting candidly say, we are doing this for

21 partisan reasons, but we recognize limits on what we

22 can do. And the limits are the traditional ones,

23 compactness, et cetera. Let us assume that there is,

24 in fact, evidence of a good faith effort at least to

25 conform to those districting principles. Under those

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 circumstances, is the mid-term redistricting equally

2 illegitimate?

3 MR. SMITH: The question I think you need to

4 pose is what is the justification for doing anything,

5 not -- not for any particular line --

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be, but how

7 about the question that I posed?

8 (Laughter.)

9 MR. SMITH: Well, it seems to me, Your Honor,

10 that if -- if the -- I was trying to get to an answer.

11 I really was.

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

13 MR. SMITH: It seems to me that if -- if you

14 can -- if they can legitimately and -- and plausibly

15 say, we are -- we -- we decided to redraw the old map

16 because it was so departed -- it's so departed from

17 these important principles and values like compactness

18 and respect for subdivision -- so if that's our reason

19 --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I'm -- in a way, I'm

21 making it easy for you. I'm saying, look, they're --

22 they're saying we think we can get a better deal for

23 our party, but we are respecting these districting

24 principles. Equally illegitimate?

25 MR. SMITH: I think so, Your Honor. If all

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 they're saying is we -- we didn't go as crazy as we

2 could have, but the only reason we did anything is

3 because we want more seats, but we could have done even

4 worse, that seems to me not a -- not a justification

5 for action, but merely a -- a decision not to -- to be

6 more political than purely political.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: The difficulty I have with

8 that is that it is -- it is impossible -- I think you

9 would agree. It is impossible -- and may, indeed --

10 let's assume undesirable -- to take partisanship out of

11 a political process. And -- and if partisanship pure

12 and simple, even though subject to the discipline of

13 districting principles, is -- is illegitimate, then I

14 don't see why that does not imply the illegitimacy of

15 any districting at any time.

16 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, our -- our

17 submission is it makes a difference when it's pure

18 rather than merely one of the many things that is going

19 on.

20 If I could take a few minutes just to talk

21 about our section 2 argument with respect to the

22 African American --

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Before you do that, may I

24 just ask one short question?

25 MR. SMITH: Sure.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: You've mainly attacked the

2 plan as a whole in your briefs. And I'm wondering. I

3 often look at particular districts, as you may know.

4 Are there residents of districts 23, district 24 that

5 are plaintiffs?

6 MR. SMITH: We have plaintiffs in every

7 district, I think, on the whole map, certainly any

8 district that would raise a concern under --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: But they're not identified

10 easily --

11 MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, but -- but I

12 think that there -- there was a -- in the complaint

13 there's allegations about where each of these people

14 live, and I think that -- that we were very careful to

15 make sure anything we were talking about specifically,

16 such as, for example, district 24 in Dallas, we had --

17 we had plaintiffs. The -- the list is quite long. So

18 there is standing, I think, for all of those arguments.

19 Now, on -- on district 24, our submission is

20 that under section 2, there ought to be protection for

21 districts where the minority group does not have an

22 absolute majority but where the evidence shows that it

23 can effectively elect a candidate of its choice in --

24 in concert with a -- a predictable group of Anglo or

25 sometimes Hispanic crossover voters, and that we think

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 on the facts of this case, this was such a district

2 because the African Americans in every case were a

3 large majority of the voters in the Democratic primary

4 and the Democratic nominee, in virtually every case, is

5 elected in this district regardless of what -- what

6 race that person may be.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was the

8 percentage of the African American voters in the

9 district as a whole?

10 MR. SMITH: Citizen voting age population is

11 26 percent, Your Honor. The --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but if -- if your --

13 if your test is that section 2 ought to be opened up to

14 any racial group that could influence an -- an election,

15 I don't see the limits on your principle.

16 MR. SMITH: That's not our -- our test, Your

17 Honor. Our test is they -- they have to control the

18 election, and --

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if you had a

20 situation where it's 40 percent one group, 40 percent

21 another group, and 20 percent where the 20 percent

22 controlled who was elected by siding with one group or

23 the other group, then you would say that that was an

24 influence district for that small -- the smallest group

25 in the district?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SMITH: Your Honor, I don't think that

2 would work because I think the way we -- we view what

3 you have -- you -- the group has to be able to decide

4 who's going to be on the ballot, and then you want to

5 see whether there's enough crossover voting to --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. Suppose there's a

7 primary where it works that they can get on the ballot.

8 Suppose we're looking at the general election.

9 MR. SMITH: If -- if that group gets to

10 decide who gets on the ballot --

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Accept the hypothetical.

12 MR. SMITH: Yes. If that group has -- has

13 picked who gets on the ballot and their choice always

14 wins the general election, I think that's not an

15 influence district. That's -- that's --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the answer? I mean,

17 you've read the briefs. The obvious reply to that is

18 there are many, many districts in the United States

19 where African American voters have a big influence on

20 the Democratic primary.

21 MR. SMITH: Yes.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: A lot. And there are a lot

23 where the Democrat wins. So if your principle is

24 accepted, says the other side, that means that any

25 district that's drawn here to favor the Democrats can't

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 be changed, but all the ones that favor the Republicans

2 can be changed. Now, if that argument is right, it's

3 hard for me to accept, but that's a neutral principle

4 of constitutional law. So I want to see what -- what

5 your response is to that.

6 MR. SMITH: I think there are a number of

7 limiting principles that apply here that -- that

8 suggest we're not just coming in here and asking for

9 the Voting Rights Act to become the -- the pro-

10 Democratic act --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: Obviously you're not.

12 That's why I would like --

13 MR. SMITH: And -- and --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: -- you to say what

15 specifically the answer to that argument is.

16 MR. SMITH: The -- the -- first of all, there

17 are not that many districts in which African Americans

18 control the Democratic primary and then have

19 predictable ability to see that person elected in -- in

20 the general election. Where that is the truth, they

21 then have representation of the kind that I think is

22 valuable under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

23 Now, of course, there are going to be limits.

24 One of them is De Grandy. They -- they only have

25 rights up to a proportional level of their proportion

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of the population. And by not respecting -- not

2 protecting this kind of district, what you do is, in

3 fact, condemn the people, the African Americans in

4 Texas, to less than proportional representation because

5 there is no other way to give them a district in which

6 they have any possibility of -- of participation in the

7 process and electing a candidate of their choice. This

8 is the only place in Texas where it can be done.

9 They're -- they are more than an eighth of the

10 population, citizen voting age population, and they're

11 only getting 3 districts out of 32 because the State of

12 Texas chose to eliminate this district.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: This would be at -- least

14 your criterion, whether we accept it or not, would --

15 would be more administrable if we're dealing with the

16 elimination of a district than if we were dealing with

17 the question of creating one. Do you take the position

18 that the NAAC brief does that there really should be

19 distinct criteria, depending on whether you're asking

20 to create something new or preserve something which has

21 been in place?

22 MR. SMITH: I -- I perhaps have more faith in

23 the ability of courts to predict the future than -- than

24 that brief does, but -- but I certainly can imagine a

25 rule where the court says, we're going to require that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there be experience, not simply predictions by experts,

2 in order to create a district below the majority level.

3 That would be an administrable rule which would give

4 -- at least give some protection in situations of the

5 kind that we -- we face here.

6 If I could reserve the balance of my time,

7 Your Honor.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Smith.

10 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NINA PERALES

11 ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 05-439

12 MS. PERALES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

13 please the Court:

14 I will begin by arguing that Texas violated

15 the Equal Protection Clause by making excessive use of

16 race in its changes to district 23. After removing

17 100,000 Latinos from district 23, the State used race

18 to craft a razor-thin Latino majority. Abandoning

19 political data, the State used census block

20 redistricting to achieve 50.9 percent Latino voting age

21 population.

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In 23.

23 MS. PERALES: In district 23, Your Honor.

24 Thus, the State used race, as we contend, not

25 only to protect an incumbent, but to give the false

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 impression of Latino support for that incumbent.

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Focus for a minute just on

3 the -- what we can call the removal, the drawing of the

4 lines to exclude some Latino voters. Just focus on

5 that, not the later justification. The district court

6 found that this was for political reasons, not racial

7 reasons, even though it was a largely racial group that

8 was removed. Do you attack that finding as clearly

9 erroneous?

10 MS. PERALES: Yes, Justice Kennedy, we do

11 attack that finding as clearly erroneous. This case is

12 really the flip side of Easley v. Cromartie because in

13 this case Latino voters supported Republican and

14 Democratic candidates. As the State asserts

15 vigorously, Latino voters voted significantly and

16 substantially --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt you just

18 with one -- one question on district 23? Regardless of

19 what the intent of the parties was, I'm just wondering

20 why is the district court's finding on intent relevant

21 to the section 2 issue when the test under section 2 is

22 results?

23 MS. PERALES: Yes, Justice Stevens. The --

24 the test under section 2 is results, and that goes --

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: So that even if the intent

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 was primarily political, it would still violate section

2 2.

3 MS. PERALES: Yes, and we argue in our brief

4 exactly that. But we hope today to focus in oral

5 argument at least first on the Fourteenth Amendment

6 violation, which is the intentional use of race both as

7 intentional vote dilution, as well as the analytically

8 distinct claim under Shaw v. Miller.

9 With respect to the question whether Latino

10 voters voted with such a high correlation -- and that's

11 the phrase used from Easley v. Cromartie -- whether

12 there was such a high correlation between Latino voters

13 and Democratic voters, particularly in district 23, to

14 justify removing them because of their race and then

15 saying that they were Democrats, that nexus simply

16 doesn't exist under the facts of this case.

17 Besides the State's arguments and -- and the

18 many assertions that it makes with respect to Latino

19 voting support for Republican candidates and especially

20 Congressman Bonilla, we also have Latino voting for

21 Bonilla that rises and falls. If Latinos were close

22 adherents to the Democratic ticket, you wouldn't see

23 fluctuating support for Congressman Bonilla. You would

24 see low and steady support if Latinos were Democratic

25 voters. Instead, we see something very different,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 which is Congressman Bonilla gaining support in the

2 Latino community within his district up until 1996

3 where the peak is 30 percent Latino support and then a

4 steady decline over a series of elections, ending in

5 2002 with only 8 percent, as the district court found,

6 Latino support for Congressman Bonilla. This is not --

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does that undermine

8 the assumption that there's -- they're voting as a

9 bloc? 30 percent of the group is voting for one

10 candidate. Is that sufficient to establish a voting

11 bloc?

12 MS. PERALES: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. Under

13 section 2's question with respect to racially polarized

14 voting, we would contend that voting as a bloc 70

15 percent or subsequently higher than 70 percent to 90-92

16 percent is enough under section 2 to satisfy the test

17 whether Latinos are voting cohesively. Congressman

18 Bonilla has never been able to garner a majority of

19 Latino support, not more than 30 percent.

20 But with respect to a somewhat different

21 question, which is whether partisanship and race

22 correlate so highly in district 23, that you can remove

23 Latinos and in the hopes of being able to take the

24 Democratic index down, we say that that kind of voting

25 is not tight enough. In Easley v. Cromartie, of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 course, the Court found that African American voters

2 voted 95 to 97 percent for Democratic candidates across

3 elections.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. Does

5 this go to motive or result? I mean, what if I'm --

6 I'm stupid and I think there's the correlation and I

7 remove it for that reason? I'm not removing them for

8 racial reasons. I'm removing them because I want to

9 remove Democrats. And you're saying that if I have

10 made a mistake about how solidly they vote Democratic,

11 that turns my validly non-racial decision into a racial

12 decision?

13 MS. PERALES: This Court made clear in Bush

14 v. Vera that the State may not make exactly the kind of

15 assumption, Justice Scalia, that you described. The --

16 the Court held in Bush v. Vera that you cannot use race

17 as a proxy for partisanship. You cannot make that

18 assumption. So if the State --

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but that was

20 because it was deliberate in that case, and that's not

21 the hypothetical that Justice Scalia has posed.

22 MS. PERALES: In this case, we contend that

23 the State removed Latino voters from district 23

24 because they were Latino and that --

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's not the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 hypothetical that was posed to you by the Justice.

2 MS. PERALES: That if the State --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm assuming --

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: As I -- as I understood it.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- they're removing them

6 because they're Democrats, but I'm wrong about that.

7 MS. PERALES: Then it is still wrong to take

8 out 100,000 Latinos using that assumption. I mean, the

9 -- the act that was done was to slice through the most

10 Latino county in the United States, 95 percent Latino.

11 The people were not removed anywhere else. Clearly,

12 the State removed Latinos from this district and then

13 said, well, we did it because we were aiming for

14 Democrats.

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: But is it -- is it wrong

16 under the Equal Protection Clause or is it wrong under

17 section 2?

18 MS. PERALES: It's wrong under both, we would

19 argue in our brief.

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: No. But on Justice --

21 Justice Scalia's hypothesis, there is no intention to

22 remove Latinos as Latinos. And maybe the answer to

23 that is if you're removing Latinos, it does not matter

24 whether your motivation is invidious or not. I don't

25 know whether that's your position. But it -- if that's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 not your position, then I think there's got to be a

2 difference between the -- the Equal Protection Clause

3 analysis and the section 2 analysis.

4 MS. PERALES: We contend that in this case

5 the removal is invidious because it was Latinos that

6 were identified and taken out and then -- for

7 incumbency protection, similar to what --

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is that because there

9 were no other Democrats who could have been identified

10 and taken out?

11 MS. PERALES: There's no testimony that the

12 State considered ever taking out anybody else but the

13 people in Webb County.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said that the

15 county was 92 percent Latino or something like that.

16 MS. PERALES: Yes, Justice Scalia.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how can you -- how can

18 you possibly take out any substantial number of

19 Democrats without taking out Latinos?

20 MS. PERALES: That's exactly our point, that

21 the State removed --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's my point too.

23 (Laughter.)

24 MS. PERALES: Moving to what I -- the point

25 --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I -- can I -- I

2 don't understand -- I think your argument is at cross

3 purposes. I mean, the one point -- and you're making

4 the point that the Democrats do not vote overwhelmingly

5 for the Democratic candidate. They voted as much as 30

6 percent for Bonilla. But the Voting Rights Act is

7 concerned with whether or not a group voting ethnically

8 as a bloc can vote for candidates of its choice. Well,

9 if they're 30/70, it's not -- it's hard to think of

10 them as having a clear candidate of choice. So what

11 does it matter whether they're in or out?

12 MS. PERALES: I agree, Mr. Chief Justice, but

13 under the facts of this case, what had happened by 2002

14 was something very, very different. After 1996, when

15 Mr. Bonilla garnered the high of 30 percent among

16 Latino voters, not -- not in his district but among

17 that group --

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, the percentage

19 goes up, the percentage goes down.

20 MS. PERALES: Yes.

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It depends on who's

22 running against him. At the low point, there was a

23 popular Hispanic candidate running against him in some

24 of those elections.

25 But it seems to me that the predicate for

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 coverage under the Voting Rights Act that a particular

2 group is being denied the opportunity to elect a

3 candidate of its choice doesn't even come into play if

4 you're right that the -- the vote is split over time,

5 depending on the circumstances in a particular

6 election.

7 MS. PERALES: No, Mr. Chief Justice, because

8 this is bloc voting at rates of 70 percent or higher,

9 and after 1996, that 70 percent bloc went to 80 percent

10 and then it went to 90 percent. And as the voters

11 became increasingly disenchanted, I suppose, with the

12 incumbent, that decline was steady. It didn't

13 fluctuate up and down. It was going down and it went

14 down even farther. Mr. Bonilla was always opposed by a

15 Latino candidate in each of his general elections that

16 he's had since he's been elected. So that hasn't

17 really been a factor for the voters. But as they

18 became more cohesive and they reached 55 percent of the

19 -- the registration in the district, they were poised

20 to elect their candidate of choice.

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then -- well,

22 but then -- and this is why I say it's an argument at

23 cross purposes. If you're right about that, then the

24 assumption that the Hispanic voters are going to be

25 voting Democratic is not one that was unfounded, which

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 I thought was your -- your first point.

2 MS. PERALES: We would contend, Mr. Chief

3 Justice, that voting against Congressman Bonilla

4 doesn't make you a Democrat. And it, in fact,

5 highlights that the State was seeking voters, Latino

6 voters, who had withdrawn their support for Congressman

7 Bonilla as opposed to just seeking Democrats because you

8 can vote against Congressman Bonilla and still vote

9 Republican in other races, as Latinos did. And you

10 could have been a former supporter of Congressman

11 Bonilla. It doesn't make you a Democrat in that sense

12 that race and partisanship are completely

13 interchangeable so that the State can scoop in and grab

14 100,000 people of the same race and then say later,

15 well, we were taking out Democrats.

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not just the

17 State that's saying it, though. You have a district

18 court finding that ethnicity was not the predominant

19 factor, that politics was the predominant factor.

20 Maybe -- as Justice Scalia suggests, maybe they were

21 right, maybe they were wrong, but the point was that it

22 was being done for political purposes not for ethnic

23 purposes.

24 MS. PERALES: We agree, Mr. Chief Justice,

25 that the end goal was political in the sense of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 incumbency protection, but a State may not use race as

2 the means to the end of protecting an incumbent. What

3 happened here was that the only group of voters who had

4 shifted their support away from Congressman Bonilla

5 were Latino. Democrats had never voted for Congressman

6 Bonilla. The problem inside this district was not a

7 problem of Democratic voters. It was Latino voters who

8 had supported him and withdrawn.

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, can -- can the State

10 use race as the means to an end of electing a new

11 candidate that the race wants? And what should be the

12 difference?

13 MS. PERALES: It should turn on the candidate

14 of choice --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, it sounds like

16 you're going to say race cannot be used as this basis,

17 but how can race be used not to protect an incumbent

18 but to allow the group to choose the representative of

19 its choice and then reelect him every year?

20 MS. PERALES: Well, district 23 was created

21 by the Balderas court pursuant to a finding under

22 section 2. So it was a remedial district under section

23 2 when it was created in 2001. And in 2002, when it

24 was used as a remedial district, it -- it elected a

25 Latino-preferred candidate in 13 out of 15 elections,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 according to the State's expert, and came very close to

2 unseating Congressman Bonilla. The State's response

3 was essentially to punish Latino voters for voting

4 against Congressman Bonilla by slicing them out of the

5 district. So the State used race to achieve its end of

6 -- of incumbency protection.

7 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the -- if the

8 objective is just to get rid of voters who vote

9 against Congressman Bonilla, why is that an equal

10 protection violation? It's not done for -- for race or

11 ethnicity, but just to get rid of voters who vote against

12 him.

13 MS. PERALES: Because the group of voters who

14 had withdrawn their support were Latino voters. The

15 district court discusses the -- the interrelationship

16 of these phenomenon in its opinion at jurisdictional

17 statement appendix 128 when it says, the State acted to

18 shore up the incumbency of Congressman Bonilla, and the

19 next sentence is, his support among Latino voters had

20 dropped to 8 percent. It was, in fact, the -- the

21 voting behavior of Latinos as opposed to anybody else

22 who had caused the incumbency crisis, and it was

23 Latinos as Latinos who were removed from the district.

24 At the same time, however, the redistricters

25 sat down and figured out exactly how many Latinos they

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 wanted to leave inside this district to achieve a bare,

2 razor-thin Latino voting age majority population, and

3 that was done to give the impression of Latino support

4 for the incumbent. The chief redistricter --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that -- and what

6 relevance does that have? What provision of the

7 Constitution prevents you from leaving a majority of

8 one group in a district to create the impression that

9 the district supports a particular candidate?

10 MS. PERALES: The Fourteenth Amendment, Mr.

11 Chief Justice, race may --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what the

13 Fourteenth Amendment was passed for, to avoid creating

14 the impression that a particular group supports a

15 particular candidate?

16 MS. PERALES: This Court has held that race

17 may not be used for its own sake in redistricting, and

18 here race was used most gratuitously and cynically to

19 make sure that the State could say a majority of

20 Latinos in district 23 support Congressman Bonilla.

21 The chief redistricter in the House, Representative

22 Phil King, testified -- and this is expressed motivation

23 -- that they sought to maintain a 50 percent Latino

24 voting age majority in the district while making it

25 safer for Congressman Bonilla, which involved pulling

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 100,000 Latinos out.

2 Similarly --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And how many -- what

4 percentage would they have shifted from making it look

5 like a Hispanic opportunity district with about 51

6 percent to when it would actually be one? What

7 percentage does it shift from being looking like one to

8 being one, both above a majority?

9 MS. PERALES: Oh, yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but

10 -- but quite a distance. The -- as the Balderas court

11 --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what's the

13 number?

14 MS. PERALES: The voting age population for

15 district 23, as created by the Balderas court, Your

16 Honor, was a great deal higher. It was 63 percent, and

17 that was what was able to give the 55 percent voter

18 registration --

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that your number?

20 It has to -- anything short of 63, it's just looking

21 like it? I mean, really, you're asking us to draw a

22 very fine line between a -- in each case a majority

23 Hispanic voting age district, but in one case, it's a

24 constitutional violation and in the other case, it's --

25 it's required by the Voting Rights Act. So what is the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 magic number between 51 and 63?

2 MS. PERALES: We would argue that race cannot

3 be used for its own sake, that if you're going to put

4 people together into a Latino majority district, it

5 should be to meet a purpose, for example, to create an

6 opportunity district under the Voting Rights Act.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's the number?

8 MS. PERALES: That would be -- well,

9 depending on how many people it takes in that

10 particular district to elect a candidate of choice. In

11 this case it was 63 percent. It might be a different

12 number for a different district. But your --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if this district

14 were drawn with 60 percent, you would say that's just

15 to make it look like a Hispanic district?

16 MS. PERALES: No, Your Honor.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. So what's the

18 number? It's -- it's somewhat more than 51 percent

19 because you're saying that's a constitutional

20 violation, and I want to know how many more it takes

21 before it becomes what's required under the Voting

22 Rights Act.

23 MS. PERALES: Maybe I can answer the question

24 by going around to the court's finding, which was that

25 district 23 was created not as a Latino opportunity

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 district, that it would not operate to offer the

2 opportunity to elect the Latino preferred candidate.

3 And the -- and the district court found this on page

4 145-146 of our appendix to the jurisdictional statement.

5 And in that same paragraph, they said, but it has a

6 political nuance that Congressman Bonilla will be elected

7 from a Latino majority district.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm just trying to

9 get a number. If you're asking us to rule on a

10 constitutional violation, I'm asking to find out what

11 the number is that changes it from a political nuance

12 to a Hispanic opportunity.

13 MS. PERALES: That number would be the number

14 that shows Latinos have the opportunity to elect their

15 candidate of choice. It will be a different number for

16 each district, but it would always be in the evidence

17 of the case because the analysis is done on different

18 districts.

19 Here, all of the experts agreed that district

20 23 had been created so that it would not elect a Latino

21 candidate of choice, but that the State testified that

22 it wanted to keep it voting age majority, that they did

23 so because they wanted Henry Bonilla to run from a

24 Latino majority district. The State abandoned

25 traditional redistricting criteria to do so,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 redistricting at the bloc level and splitting 6

2 election precincts out of 51 in Webb County, which is

3 wholly unnecessary even to equalize population in

4 either district. There is no reason for the State --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it have been

6 better --

7 MS. PERALES: -- to have done that.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- would it have been

9 better in your view if they had excluded more Hispanics

10 so it didn't look like a Hispanic opportunity district?

11 MS. PERALES: Well, the State certainly could

12 have moved Webb County whole out of the district. It

13 depends on how they would have done the overall --

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and that would

15 have been preferable. It would have been preferable to

16 you if it was, say, 45 percent Hispanic rather than

17 50.8, or whatever it was.

18 MS. PERALES: Mr. Chief Justice, it -- it

19 just doesn't hang on a particular number. It -- it

20 turns on whether or not the district is an opportunity

21 district, and if it isn't an opportunity district, why

22 is the State sitting down and using race for its own

23 sake to be able to say we got 50.9 percent Latino

24 voting age population? We managed to zigzag that

25 boundary through the streets and -- and through the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

56
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 neighborhoods of the City of Laredo so that we could

2 say it was a Latino majority district.

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't -- isn't one

4 answer that we were doing it, number one, because we

5 wanted to protect the incumbent and we also had to use

6 race to avoid a section 5 problem and a section 2

7 claim? You've got to use race for those purposes.

8 MS. PERALES: Well, under section 5, the

9 State went ahead and created district 25 as the offset

10 because it seemed fairly clear that district 23 had

11 been dismantled to such a degree it was no longer going

12 to be able to be used for section 5 purposes.

13 Similarly, under section 2, the State saw

14 that it was terribly vulnerable and so again tried to

15 make an offset district which caused its own problems.

16 So the use of race here to achieve the 50.9

17 percent voting age majority was not to satisfy the

18 Voting Rights Act, either section 5 or section 2.

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: So you could have used that

20 reasoning to create a district in the first place, but

21 you cannot use that reasoning to create an offset

22 district in the second place at the same time that

23 you're trying to protect an incumbent. I think that's

24 what you're saying.

25 MS. PERALES: To create a district with 50.9

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

57

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 percent voting age population here in this part of the

2 State, it would be obvious that you weren't going to

3 yield an opportunity district.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, you're

5 saying that would be implausible as a section 2/section

6 5 justification, regardless of when you're doing it.

7 Is that --

8 MS. PERALES: Yes.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

10 MS. PERALES: Yes, most certainly.

11 This case represents an egregious use of race

12 in redistricting. Without the Equal Protection Clause

13 to protect minority voters, States will have free rein

14 to use race to manipulate not only electoral outcomes,

15 as it did here, but also the complexion of a district

16 in order to be able to express some kind of symbolic --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: But, of course, you want

18 them to use race to manipulate outcomes. It's just

19 sometimes.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may answer.

21 MS. PERALES: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

22 To serve a compelling State interest, to

23 comply with the Voting Rights Act, yes, Justice Scalia,

24 it is appropriate. It was not appropriate here.

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.

3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ

4 ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

5 MR. CRUZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

6 please the Court:

7 The central issue in resolving these various

8 challenges to mid-decade redistricting is determining

9 which institution is constitutionally vested with the

10 primary responsibility for redistricting. Elected

11 legislatures or Federal courts.

12 In Texas, for the first time in 12 years, the

13 legislature acted to adopt a congressional

14 redistricting map. That map, in turn, replaced one of

15 the most profoundly anti-majoritarian congressional

16 maps in the country with a map that reflects the

17 demonstrated preferences --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: But may I ask, General

19 Cruz, are you talking about replacing the court-ordered

20 map or the preceding Democrat gerrymandered map?

21 MR. CRUZ: The legislature replaced the

22 court-ordered map, but the court found as a factual

23 matter that the court-ordered map, in the court's

24 words, quote, perpetuated the 1991 Democratic Party

25 gerrymander, and that was the court characterizing its

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

59

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 own map with the same judges.

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but you don't think it

3 really perpetuated the same degree of gerrymandering

4 that was present in the earlier map, do you?

5 MR. CRUZ: Well, the court's map, under the

6 --

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm asking you.

8 MR. CRUZ: Yes.

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think it did? Do

10 you think --

11 MR. CRUZ: Yes, we do.

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- the court-ordered map is

13 just as bad as the Democratic map?

14 MR. CRUZ: The district court found that it

15 had blunted some of the most egregious lines, but under

16 the district court's map, 28 of 28 incumbents were

17 reelected. So the identical outcome was yielded.

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: But is your opponent

19 correct in saying that in six of those districts, the

20 Democrat won even though the district was majority

21 Republican?

22 MR. CRUZ: That -- that is correct, and then

23 the district court --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that sound like a

25 gerrymander?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

60

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. CRUZ: It -- it depends. The districts

2 were drawn such that the Democrats who were running

3 were incumbency. And the reality of congressional

4 elections is that incumbency is a tremendous advantage,

5 and in the face of incumbency --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I was going to say I --

7 if I were gerrymandering, I would absolutely want to

8 leave majority other party districts in which the

9 people from the other party were voting for a candidate

10 from my party with some regularity. I'd want to do

11 that. That's exactly what I'd want a gerrymander to

12 do.

13 MR. CRUZ: And that's exactly right. These

14 districts were drawn to protect incumbents.

15 It is notable that if one looks on a national

16 level, the 2001 map drawn by the court led to the most

17 anti-majoritarian results of any of the 50 States in

18 the Union. There were only two other States with more

19 than five Members of Congress that saw a minority of

20 voters electing a majority of the delegation, and those

21 were Illinois and Tennessee. In each of those, 49

22 percent in Illinois elected one extra seat to Congress;

23 in Tennessee, 48 percent. In Texas, by contrast, 45

24 percent of the two-party vote and 41 percent of the

25 overall State vote elected not just a one-seat

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

61

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 majority, but a two-seat majority. And so on any

2 national level, the prior map was the most profoundly

3 anti-majoritarian.

4 Now, this Court resolved in -- in Vieth that

5 majoritarianism is not a constitutional mandate, but

6 that being said, as Mr. Smith characterized in Vieth,

7 he characterized the fundamental principle of democracy

8 -- and this is Mr. Smith's characterization -- is the

9 principle that a majority can elect a majority of the

10 delegation.

11 And as this Court concluded in Gaffney v.

12 Cummings, achieving political fairness, achieving a

13 rough sense of proportionality, such that a majority

14 can elect a majority of the delegation, is not only

15 legitimate, it is salutary. It is --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So I -- I wrote

17 an opinion, as you know, where I was agreeing with you

18 on that, and I wonder if -- if then the thing to do

19 would be to say, yes, indeed, a legislature can redraw

20 a map to prevent a minority of the voters electing a

21 majority of the congressional delegation. But when

22 they do that, there has to be some reasonable assurance

23 that it works the same way for both parties. I mean as

24 a standard. I thought my standard worked before. I

25 guess there wasn't that much agreement, but -- but --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

62

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 (Laughter.)

2 JUSTICE BREYER: -- from the point of view of

3 -- of taking that standard, which you agree with, I'm

4 glad to say, apparently, and modifying it to be sure it

5 works out the same way for both.

6 MR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, under the standard

7 articulated in your opinion in Vieth, in our judgment

8 the result would be a straightforward affirmance here

9 because the map that was adopted is precisely what was

10 advocated in Vieth of a majority of the population

11 electing a majority of the delegation.

12 That being said, the question here is not

13 whether that is required. Indeed, it is ironic. In

14 1992 the Republicans in Texas brought a political

15 gerrymandering challenge to the predecessor map here,

16 and that map was rejected -- that challenge was

17 rejected under Bandemer, and the district court in 1992

18 told the Republican plaintiffs -- said even though this

19 may be tilted against you, there is nothing to prevent

20 you, over the ensuing decade, from running candidates,

21 from building support, and from eventually taking

22 control by electing your candidates to the machinery of

23 government and adopting a map you deem fair.

24 That -- those words of the district court

25 prove prescient because that is precisely what happened

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

63

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 over the ensuing decade, and it is equally true today.

2 There is nothing in Texas to prevent the Democratic

3 Party from doing the exact same thing over the ensuing

4 decade if they can command a majority of votes at the

5 polls.

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this

7 question? Assume you're correct that as a whole the

8 plan is well-justified and makes gains and so forth.

9 Does that necessarily mean that every district within

10 the -- the plan is immune from constitutional attack?

11 MR. CRUZ: Of course, it does not, and there

12 are a variety of district-specific attacks. The

13 plaintiffs have framed their partisan gerrymandering

14 attack as one that focuses on the map as a whole. And

15 -- and the --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand.

17 MR. CRUZ: -- and the reason for that is that

18 in the Vieth decision, Justice Kennedy's concurrence

19 was the controlling concurrence, and it set out a

20 standard for subsequent partisan gerrymandering cases

21 that litigants should find a, quote, substantive

22 definition of fairness in districting that commands

23 general assent.

24 Rather than attempt to meet that challenge,

25 the plaintiffs have refused to discuss effects at all,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

64

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and that's not by accident because any assessment of

2 effects would yield that the current plan is more fair

3 than the predecessor.

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the -- the next

5 question I wanted to ask you is that if it is possible

6 there can be a single-district challenge, what is the

7 justification for the -- the cracking of district 24,

8 which was a majority Democratic district before, into

9 five different districts, none of which would elect a

10 Democrat.

11 MR. CRUZ: The legislature made a policy

12 judgment, and under the decision --

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: But is it -- is it defended

14 by anything other than political motivation?

15 MR. CRUZ: There were a host of --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: I mean in district 24.

17 MR. CRUZ: There were a host of judgments

18 about the multiple districts that district 24 was

19 broken into, and the district court found, for example,

20 that Representative Grusendorf wanted the City of

21 Arlington contained in one single district. There were

22 a whole host of specific motivations about the

23 surrounding districts that were drawn.

24 Indeed, the district court said on remand

25 that appellants' argument ignores, as it must, the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

65
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 reality that the lines are infused with the myriad

2 mixtures of local politics and accommodations, often

3 inconsistent with overall objectives of partisan gains.

4 That was the district court's finding on remand, that

5 there are a host of decisions here that have nothing to

6 do with partisan gain, that have to do with drawing a

7 map that are the constitutional responsibility of a

8 legislature in drawing a redistricting map.

9 Appellants frame their basic challenge on

10 partisan gerrymandering because they cannot look at

11 effects, because any examination of substantive effects

12 yields the conclusion that the current map is much more

13 fair than the prior. They disavow any examination of

14 effects. Instead, they frame it as solely partisan

15 intent, which has never been the standard under this

16 Court's precedents. But even under that standard, they

17 base it on a simple syllogism that is found nowhere in

18 the Court's precedents, a syllogism that says because

19 there was an extant legal map in place, the

20 redistricting was unnecessary. And so anytime there is

21 a court map, it is unnecessary redistricting.

22 The problem is appellants raise a false

23 dichotomy because every legislative redistricting is

24 voluntary. Whether it is Texas in 2003 or Pennsylvania

25 in 2001, the legislatures face a binary choice. They

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

66

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 can act and adopt their legislative policy preferences,

2 or they can not act, in which case they know with an

3 absolute certainty that a court-drawn map will govern

4 the election that follows. In Pennsylvania, to be

5 sure, it was a map that would be drawn subsequently,

6 but the decision is the same. Does the legislature act

7 to embody its preferences or does it allow a court-

8 drawn map to govern the elections in the States?

9 And I would note the consequence of the rule

10 that appellants are urging is that it would create an

11 enormous incentive for the minority party in every

12 State to attempt to deadlock the system, to shut down

13 at the beginning of the decade any effort to adopt a

14 map because if they're able to deadlock the system, if

15 they are able, as happened in Texas, to flee the State

16 and no map passes, the consequence of that -- they

17 would know for certain under appellants' rule -- is a

18 court will draw the map. And under the Upham standard,

19 the court map will reflect the preexisting policy

20 judgments of the predecessor legislature. So any

21 minority party has an incentive. If they can stop it

22 from happening at the beginning of the decade, they

23 have an incentive to seek a better map.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: A -- a minority who was a

25 majority.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

67

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. CRUZ: Indeed, yes. That -- that is

2 predicated upon a preference for a decade ago rather

3 than what would be adopted now.

4 The Framers chose political checks for the

5 problem of partisan gerrymandering. They assigned

6 principal responsibility to elected State legislatures

7 whom they certainly knew would care a great deal about

8 politics, and they assigned supervisory authority to

9 another elected legislature, Congress.

10 The appellants point to a host of perceived

11 policy problems about the specter of seriatim

12 redistricting of legislatures coming back every 2 years

13 and tweaking the line here and tweaking the line there.

14 To the extent that is a problem, Congress is the

15 institution constitutionally authorized to address it,

16 and there is no indication that there is a looming

17 threat of seriatim redistricting. It didn't happen

18 here. It was the first time in 12 years the

19 legislature had acted.

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: General Cruz, could I ask

21 you another district-specific question? Because I want

22 to get it on the table and let you explain it to me.

23 Focusing on district 23 for a moment, assuming for the

24 moment -- and I -- I know you probably disagree with

25 this but -- that the results of the redrawing of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

68
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 district 23 violated section 2, would you say that it

2 would be a defense to that violation that the

3 motivation was actually non-racial but purely

4 political?

5 MR. CRUZ: As the hypothetical is -- is

6 asked, the answer would be no. But -- but the

7 difficulty is if the motivation -- if there's a

8 violation of section 2, a political motivation does not

9 excuse it.

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Not a defense.

11 And the second question for me is that if

12 there were a violation in district 23 of section 2,

13 could it be cured by creating a district -- the

14 district farther to the east. I forget the number. 25

15 I guess it was. Would that be a cure in your -- in

16 your judgment?

17 MR. CRUZ: The Court has concluded before --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Given what the Court said

19 in Shaw II.

20 MR. CRUZ: Right, right, that -- that a -- a

21 section 2 violation in one area cannot be corrected

22 with a discrete change in a different area.

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

24 MR. CRUZ: However, in De Grandy, the Court

25 also said that the assessment is the totality of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

69
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 circumstances in the region under assessment. And in

2 the totality of circumstances, the district court made

3 factual findings against the plaintiffs that they

4 cannot demonstrate were clearly erroneous. Indeed,

5 that -- that is the problem with all of the district-

6 specific claims that all of the sets of plaintiffs have

7 brought is that this was tried in a full trial. The

8 district court took testimony, made credibility

9 determinations --

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Except for the fact the

11 district court really didn't find a violation in

12 section 2. They didn't quite, as I'm suggesting, say,

13 well, given a violation on section 2, can we cure it

14 and have a defense by what we do in -- in district 25.

15 And I don't think De Grandy is an answer to that, and

16 I'm not quite sure whether you said yes or no on my

17 question.

18 MR. CRUZ: If they are wholly different areas

19 --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

21 MR. CRUZ: -- the Court has concluded no.

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

23 MR. CRUZ: If they are --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: So the argument -- the

25 question then would be whether district 25 is a wholly

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

70

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 different area from district 23.

2 MR. CRUZ: That's correct.

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what do we look

4 at to determine that? I know what we said in De

5 Grandy, but I mean how -- I mean, you talk about the

6 south and west Texas. I mean, on the other hand, 23

7 and 25 are actually not that close together. So how do

8 we know that we should be looking at all the way from

9 El Paso to the Gulf, as opposed to a narrower area?

10 MR. CRUZ: They are not that relatively close

11 together, but -- but that is because this region of

12 Texas is -- is vast and -- and relatively lightly

13 populated. And so district 23, for example, runs 800

14 miles in length because you've got miles and miles of

15 -- of desert land and open ranch land with very low

16 population.

17 The way the Court did it in De Grandy, which

18 is also the way the Court should do so here, is to look

19 at what the parties agreed to and how they litigated

20 the case.

21 In this case, everyone litigated the district

22 23 section 2 claim with a focus on south and west

23 Texas. Indeed, what speaks volumes is that if one

24 examines the demonstration map that the GI Forum

25 appellants introduced, which is at their -- their

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

71
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 appendix to their jurisdictional statement, page 241,

2 that map only covered south and west Texas. They

3 proposed no districts for the rest of the State. They

4 were focused --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I didn't

6 understand Ms. Perales' argument to concern section --

7 district 25 at all.

8 MR. CRUZ: It did not, and -- and, indeed,

9 she has never joined in the racial gerrymandering claim

10 that has been brought by the -- by the Jackson

11 plaintiffs. Her claim has focused on -- as -- as it

12 concerns racial gerrymandering, not that the

13 legislature did too much of it, but -- but in a sense

14 that it should have done more. It should have been

15 more aggressive in seeking to create majority minority

16 districts. And -- and the district court has factual

17 findings that rule against those claims.

18 JUSTICE BREYER: Would a -- I'd like you to

19 elaborate a little because, as I understood your claim,

20 particularly in response to Justice Stevens, you agree

21 that if 23 violated section 2, they can't make up for

22 it somewhere else. You agree they can't make up for it

23 particularly when their only way is for political

24 reasons. But your argument is they never violated --

25 that 23 as redrawn didn't violate section 2.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

72

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. CRUZ: That's correct.

2 JUSTICE BREYER: And the reason that it

3 didn't violate section 2, I want to know, is what?

4 Because you have the three preconditions which seem to

5 be met, and then you have some kind of -- it doesn't

6 violate section 2 from De Grandy if, despite the

7 preconditions, there is some kind of overall

8 proportionality. But all that is rather unclear in my

9 mind, and I want to know what your view of it is.

10 MR. CRUZ: There are multiple reasons,

11 Justice Breyer. As an initial matter, the district

12 court found on page 131a of the Jackson appendix to

13 their jurisdictional statement that CD 23 was not an

14 effective minority opportunity district. So that's a

15 direct finding that the -- that the old CD 23 was not

16 an effective minority opportunity district.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And why was that?

18 MR. CRUZ: Because the -- the data

19 demonstrated that a majority of Hispanic voters were

20 not able to elect their candidate of choice. Although

21 Congressman Bonilla consistently commanded a

22 significant percentage of Hispanic votes, he did not

23 command a majority, and the candidate for whom a

24 majority voted did not prevail in the congressional

25 election.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

73

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't that somewhat

2 inconsistent with the decision to reshape the district?

3 Why did they do it then?

4 MR. CRUZ: What the legislature did -- the

5 legislature's express intention was to shore up

6 Congressman Bonilla's electoral chances, and -- and it

7 was explicitly because Congressman Bonilla is a valued

8 member of the delegation and the legislature made a

9 judgment that they wanted to increase his margin of

10 victory. If one --

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and in your view,

12 that justification allows the creation of district 25,

13 which has, as far as Latino population, people of quite

14 different economic backgrounds and so forth, you know,

15 the -- the two-ended -- the district on the two ends.

16 MR. CRUZ: We did not --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that to me was --

18 was not discussed much in your brief, but it's a

19 serious Shaw violation. And -- and the two are really

20 linked, 23 and 25, in this respect because it was by

21 virtue of what it did in 23, that the State claims a

22 right to do what it did in 25.

23 MR. CRUZ: We did not place our principal

24 emphasis, with respect to 25, on the Voting Rights

25 Act's concerns potentially raised by the alterations in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

74

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 23. That was a motivation, but it's not our principal

2 motivation. Our principal argument on 25 is that there

3 are a series of factual findings the district court

4 made that are not clearly erroneous and, indeed, we

5 would submit, are -- are completely supported by the

6 record to --

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have a -- a

8 section 5 argument with respect to district 25 as

9 opposed to a section 2 argument involving district 23?

10 MR. CRUZ: The legislature was certainly

11 concerned about section 5, and with respect to the

12 adjustment in -- in district 23, it was possible that

13 the Department of Justice might deem the alteration of

14 district 23 to be something that would be retrogressive

15 and, accordingly, having a district that was -- a

16 performing Hispanic opportunity district would increase

17 the chances of preclearance. So -- so that was a

18 factor in the consideration, was a desire to comply

19 with section 5 and also to comply with section 2,

20 although section 5 was the -- the principal focus of

21 the legislative discussion.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it permissible for

23 a legislature concerned with section 5 to take race and

24 ethnicity in account -- into account in drawing a

25 district?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

75

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. CRUZ: This Court has never squarely

2 resolved that. This Court has assumed in the racial

3 gerrymandering cases, assumed without deciding, that

4 compliance with the Voting Rights Act is a compelling

5 interest. And the -- the districts that have been

6 struck down have been struck down as not being narrowly

7 tailored. Although we advance that argument, we don't

8 have to prevail on that argument for district 25 to

9 survive the racial gerrymandering claim.

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And as to 23, do you want

11 this Court to say that it's constitutionally

12 permissible to take away a number of minority voters

13 from the district, but leave just enough so that it

14 looks like a minority? Is that a permissible use of

15 race? It -- it seems to me that's an affront and an

16 insult.

17 MR. CRUZ: Except the district court found as

18 a factual matter that what happened in district 23 was

19 wholly political. It was not racial, so that the

20 voters were not removed because of race. They were

21 removed because of politics.

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but the

23 additional finding is that 50 percent were kept to make

24 it -- to make it look good.

25 MR. CRUZ: The -- the legislature was aware

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

76

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of -- as this Court has said, the legislature will

2 always be aware of the racial composition of a

3 district. But the legislature specifically -- for

4 example, unlike Bush v. Vera, there are no bloc-level

5 cuts based on race. Indeed, in district 23, what the

6 legislature did, by and large, is go straight down

7 Interstate 35 which cuts right in the middle of Webb

8 County. Now, if one considers Webb County, there --

9 there are two halves of it. There is the half that

10 moved into new district 28. Now, those voters

11 presumably cannot complain about being disenfranchised

12 in that. At least the Hispanic voters there are now in

13 a unquestionably performing Hispanic opportunity

14 district that elects an Hispanic Democrat to Congress.

15 The remaining voters in Webb County -- in 2004,

16 Congressman Bonilla carried a majority of Webb County,

17 and so it is difficult to see who is being

18 disenfranchised, given that both halves of Webb County

19 are electing a Congressman for whom a majority of their

20 voters are voting.

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- in -- in --

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. I'm sorry.

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: In -- in contrast to that,

24 however, you could not make that argument or -- or that

25 response with respect to -- to district 24, the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

77
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 district in which the -- the Black vote was -- was

2 cracked. And in response to earlier questions from

3 Justice Stevens, you -- you mentioned there were a

4 number of motivations for dividing it up the way it

5 did, and -- and yet, as you also acknowledge, those

6 differing motivations don't answer a -- a section 2

7 argument. What is your answer to the section 2 claim?

8 MR. CRUZ: Well, as you know, Justice Souter,

9 purpose under the '82 amendment is irrelevant to

10 section 2. It is an effects-only test, and -- and the

11 district court had a series of factual findings, most

12 of which appellants did not even challenge until their

13 reply brief, each of which is independently sufficient

14 to defeat their claim. The -- the district court found

15 against them on all three prongs of Gingles, and those

16 findings were fully supported by the record.

17 As an initial matter, the appellants

18 attempted to frame this as debating the legal question

19 over whether 50 percent is an absolute barrier. The

20 district court concluded that it needn't resolve that

21 question because the facts here presented no

22 opportunity to determine if there might be some

23 tolerable deviation below 50 percent. In this case,

24 African American voters in old district 24 comprise

25 less than 22 percent of the voting age population.

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but following Georgia

2 and Ashcroft, isn't -- isn't that a possibility that we

3 should consider as a satisfaction of what has come to

4 be known as the -- you know, the first of -- of the

5 Gingles factors?

6 MR. CRUZ: In our judgment, Georgia against

7 Ashcroft expanded the flexibility for States to

8 determine how to comply with the Voting Rights Act.

9 Georgia against Ashcroft obviously was a section 5

10 case, and it determined that in considering

11 retrogression, that opportunity districts and influence

12 districts should both be considered. It surely did not

13 mean that there was a cause of action now for any

14 plaintiff to argue that any conceivable influence

15 district must be drawn. That goes entirely against the

16 central theme of Georgia against Ashcroft, which is

17 that States have flexibility in choosing a

18 representational model for voters in that State.

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it -- it is not

20 inconsistent with Georgia and Ashcroft to say that for

21 -- for much the same reason, States have less

22 flexibility in cracking influence districts once they

23 have been established.

24 MR. CRUZ: That might perhaps be true if the

25 plaintiffs could demonstrate the other Gingles prongs,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

79

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 but on the second and third prong, the district court

2 found that African American voter cohesion was far from

3 clear and there was absolutely no cohesion between

4 African Americans and Hispanics in district 24.

5 Indeed, they voted in an almost completely polar manner

6 in Democratic primaries.

7 And third, the district court found that

8 there was not Anglo bloc voting.

9 And so all three of the prongs -- what the

10 district court found as a factual matter is that

11 district 24 functioned as an Anglo Democratic district.

12 And indeed, this case is unusual in that there were

13 some extraordinary direct testimony that the way

14 district 24 operates is not accidental, that in 1991,

15 it was explicitly drawn by Anglo Democrats for the

16 specific purpose of electing Anglo Democrats and only

17 Anglo Democrats. And that was testimony not from a

18 State witness but from Congresswoman Eddie Bernice

19 Johnson, a Democratic African American incumbent from

20 the adjoining district who was in the State legislature

21 in 1991, and she said the African American population

22 there was deliberately split up to create a district

23 that would be -- elect white Democrats. That direct

24 testimony is extraordinary and it shows that what the

25 data demonstrate, which is that white Democrats control

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

80

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the district -- and that's what the district court

2 found as a factual matter -- is not an accident. It

3 was precisely the intended effect of the map-drawers.

4 Indeed, if one looks to the three races that

5 the appellants' experts examined that were African

6 American versus Anglo in the primaries, of those three

7 races, an African American candidate of choice who was

8 Black prevailed in only one.

9 Of the 20 races appellants' experts examined,

10 of those 20, only one Black candidate prevailed, and

11 that case, the district court found, was aberrational

12 because that candidate was Ron Kirk. He was a former

13 mayor of the City of Dallas. He was a very popular,

14 local politician with a strong friends and neighbors

15 effect.

16 If you take that aberrational case out, the

17 two other cases appellants' experts looked to both

18 showed that the African American candidate, one of whom

19 was supported by 76 percent of African American voters,

20 lost. And indeed, what happened was the Anglos and the

21 Hispanics voted in virtual unison against the African

22 American candidate.

23 That data -- if one looks to the endogenous

24 races, there had never been an African American

25 opponent to Martin Frost, or the exogenous races, those

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

81

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 three we talked about -- the data demonstrate quite

2 persuasively that African Americans were drawn into a

3 district where they did not have an equal opportunity

4 to elect their candidate of choice because they lacked

5 the ability to elect a Black candidate. Now, they

6 could choose to do otherwise, but in this district,

7 they could not choose to elect a Black candidate. And

8 that was the district court's finding and that's what

9 the data demonstrated.

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, can I move

11 you south and west again, back to district 23? How do

12 we tell -- as redrawn, it had what? 50.8 percent. And

13 I gather that that's not considered a Hispanic

14 opportunity district because of lower voting turnout,

15 registration, participation? How do we tell when

16 something is being done to make it look like a Hispanic

17 district and, instead, when it's being done for the

18 opportunity of providing a Hispanic opportunity

19 district if voter turnout and registration are

20 increased?

21 MR. CRUZ: The district court made a finding

22 that the reason district 23 was altered was to increase

23 the chances of Congressman Bonilla prevailing. And in

24 particular, if one looks to Webb County, which is the

25 county that was split, Webb County centers on the City

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

82

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of Laredo. And in 2002 -- the race that the GI Forum

2 appellants focus on principally -- the candidate that

3 ran against Congressman Bonilla was Henry Cuellar, a

4 popular, local politician from Laredo, and he had a

5 very strong following in Laredo. And as a consequence,

6 Mr. Cuellar did very well in that election, came within

7 slightly under 4 points of beating Mr. Bonilla and Mr.

8 Bonilla's percentage of the -- of the Latino vote

9 dropped to its lowest historic point.

10 That, as the district court found, was also

11 aberrational because of Mr. Cuellar's very strong local

12 support, and the clearest evidence of that is under the

13 new map, when half of Webb County was placed in the

14 adjoining district, district 28, Mr. Cuellar ran

15 against the incumbent Democratic Congressman, Ciro

16 Rodriguez, and beat him in the primary, which

17 demonstrates that his success was because the -- the

18 voters in Laredo are supporters of Mr. Cuellar and,

19 accordingly, voted for him against either opponent,

20 Henry Bonilla or Mr. Rodriguez.

21 And so, when the legislature was determining

22 which section of voters to remove for political

23 reasons, the region that voted heavily against Mr.

24 Bonilla in the preceding election, Laredo, Webb County,

25 was a natural place to move voters who had in the last

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

83

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 election demonstrated they would vote for his opponent.

2 Under any assessment of 23, the prior map had

3 five districts that were indisputably Hispanic

4 opportunity districts, plus district 23 that elected

5 Congressman Bonilla, an Hispanic Republican. The

6 current map has six districts that are indisputably

7 Hispanic opportunity districts, plus district 23 which

8 elects Henry Bonilla. So the result is the same in

9 district 23, and there is an additional Hispanic

10 opportunity district in district 25.

11 If I may turn to district 25 and return to

12 Justice Kennedy's questions earlier about racial

13 gerrymandering with respect to that district.

14 The first indicium this Court has looked to

15 in racial gerrymandering case -- cases is unusual or

16 bizarre shape, and on that indicium, this district does

17 not fall anywhere near the districts this Court has

18 struck down as racial gerrymanders.

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, the reason

20 the lines are straight is nobody is there.

21 (Laughter.)

22 MR. CRUZ: But those counties have to be

23 placed in some district. And -- and so the appellants

24 call a series of seven whole contiguous counties a land

25 bridge, but those are very sparsely populated counties.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

84

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 In whatever district they're in, they're going to have

2 to connect with a population zone. And what the

3 district court found as a factual matter is that the

4 elongated nature -- the relatively elongated nature of

5 district 25 was a function of the geography and the

6 fact that you have population along the border and then

7 you have a large space of relatively low population,

8 and then you have to get back up to population. So

9 Texas historically has run north-south districts to get

10 enough population to form a congressional district

11 under this Court's one person/one vote precedents.

12 District 25, if one examines -- the district

13 court expressly found that the plaintiffs failed to

14 prove purposeful discrimination. The State defendants

15 introduced at trial a Cromartie analysis that was

16 precisely drawn from this Court's first Cromartie

17 decision, Hunt v. Cromartie, and it's found on pages

18 331 and 332 of the joint appendix. And what that

19 analysis did is precisely what this Court found in

20 Cromartie I was sufficient on summary judgment to

21 defeat a claim of racial gerrymandering.

22 It assessed the lines in Travis County, the

23 northern part of district 25, and it asked are the cuts

24 the legislature made driven by politics or driven by

25 race. And so what the State's expert did is drew a map

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

85

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that would be based on race that would maximize the

2 Hispanics in district 25 on the northern end of Travis

3 County. He then compared that map to the map that the

4 legislature had drawn and said what are the differences

5 between what it would look like if the legislature was

6 attempting to maximize race as compared to what it

7 would look like if it was attempting to maximize party.

8 And what the State's expert found is there was on the

9 order of a 1 percent differential which is you're

10 talking between 24 and 25 percent. So it was about 4

11 percent differential of fewer Hispanics in the State's

12 map and more Democrats in the State's map. And so what

13 the State's expert found is precisely along the lines

14 as the evidence in Cromartie I that the legislature had

15 drawn the map looking for Democrats rather than looking

16 for Hispanics.

17 In addition, if one examines the two

18 numerical measures of compactness, smallest circle and

19 perimeter to area, smallest circle this map measured

20 8.5, which is smaller than North Carolina's

21 reconfigured district 12 upheld in Cromartie, which was

22 8.6 Its perimeter-to-area score, 9.5, is terribly low.

23 As a -- as a means of comparison, districts 18, 29,

24 and 30 that this Court struck down in Vera had

25 perimeter-to-area scores of 106, 144, and 69, as

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

86
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 compared to district 25's score of 9.5.

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: General Cruz, if you've

3 finished your answer -- I didn't want to interrupt you,

4 but that makes -- reminds me of a question I wanted to

5 answer you because -- ask you, rather, because you make

6 a very persuasive argument in your brief, which I found

7 very helpful, that the -- a State should be able to

8 correct a prior gerrymander by -- for -- with political

9 motivations.

10 I would like you to comment on this

11 suggestion. Supposing we said they have an absolute

12 right to do that with one caveat, that any new district

13 has to be more compact -- no more -- no less compact

14 than its predecessor, wouldn't that avoid all sorts of

15 problems?

16 MR. CRUZ: That could be a salutary policy

17 goal, and -- and Congress could certainly enact that.

18 But I -- I see no -- no source in the Constitution

19 placing that requirement upon States particularly --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: We have -- we have quite a

21 history, as you just identified in your response to

22 Justice Kennedy, of being concerned about particularly

23 grotesque shapes, and that's why they developed these

24 tests of compactness for use in this very litigation.

25 And the fact that the lawyers have come up with this

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

87

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 approach to it makes me think maybe it does have some

2 relevance to the whole problem we're trying to

3 confront.

4 MR. CRUZ: At an extreme level, lack of

5 compactness can indicate something was going on. If

6 one looks at the districts this Court has struck down,

7 if you look at Bush v. Vera -- and we have in the joint

8 appendix the silhouettes of those districts that were

9 -- you know, had fingers going out in every direction.

10 There's plainly something questionable going on.

11 These districts are nothing like that.

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: When I -- when I was

13 thinking about this problem, I looked at district 24.

14 The thing that was interesting to me is that most of

15 the neutral justifications that you describe -- and

16 they're certainly in the -- in the five new districts

17 that replaced it, but in the key part of the population

18 that was moved, it becomes much less compact than it

19 was before.

20 MR. CRUZ: The -- the new map --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which it seems to me quite

22 significant.

23 MR. CRUZ: The -- the new map was somewhat

24 less compact than the prior map, but it does --

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: And its particularly --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

88

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 particular reference to the targeted group that was

2 moved out of the district.

3 MR. CRUZ: But lack of compactness does not

4 -- no one has brought a racial gerrymandering claim

5 with respect to districts other than 25 and, to some

6 extent, 23, although the 23 challenge is not a typical

7 racial gerrymandering claim.

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm suggesting the

9 challenge to 24 should be a political gerrymandering

10 challenge.

11 MR. CRUZ: I understand that, although a

12 majority of the Court in Vieth concluded that in order

13 for a political gerrymandering claim to succeed, that

14 there must be a substantive standard for fairness to

15 measure the map against some baseline.

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Justice Stevens --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: And that's the standard I'm

18 suggesting. Right. That's exactly the point.

19 MR. CRUZ: But --

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The compactness standard.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

22 MR. CRUZ: But the Court had before it --

23 appellants urged in Vieth compactness, principles of

24 cracking, principles of packing. One of the dissenting

25 Justices advocated that standard, and yet, a majority

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

89

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of the Court -- the plurality explicitly rejected it.

2 And Justice Kennedy's concurrence explicitly rejected

3 the standards discussed in the dissents, including a

4 standard looking to compactness.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that Justice

6 Stevens is suggesting that as a standard. He's

7 suggesting it as a disqualifier. If it's not as

8 compact, it's no good, but if it is as compact, he's --

9 I -- I don't think he's suggesting it's okay. So we

10 still don't have a standard.

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. I was suggesting that

12 would be a safe harbor, and -- and it would just --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: A safe harbor from an

14 unknown standard.

15 (Laughter.)

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Jump in whenever you

17 want.

18 (Laughter.)

19 MR. CRUZ: Under any standard that looks to

20 the substantive lines on the map, anything that -- and

21 we have spent hours racking our brains trying to think

22 of a standard for litigation purposes that would yield

23 the old map being more fair than the new one. We're

24 not aware of any coherent standard that looks to

25 substance.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

90

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let me ask you this.

2 Suppose you have a court that's required to

3 redistrict, and the court has two experts. Expert

4 number one says, here is a plan. It's totally partisan

5 in its orientation, but it balances the Democratic and

6 the Republican registration. It gives them exactly

7 proportional representation. Plan number two gives

8 minimal consideration to this, but it's compact. It

9 takes into account geography, communities of interest,

10 and so forth. Would the district court be in error if

11 it adopted the first plan?

12 MR. CRUZ: Well, that -- that question

13 actually was litigated in this case, the first time in

14 2001, as part of the litigation over how to draw the

15 new map. One of the arguments that was presented to

16 the district court was that the old map was no longer

17 consistent with how Texas voters were voting. And the

18 district court concluded that under the Upham case, it

19 lacked the authority to take that into account and to

20 change the demonstrated policy preferences of the last

21 legislative map. And that's why, on remand in this

22 case, the district court found although it didn't

23 intend to work partisan bias, that that was the effect

24 of its map.

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but my hypothetical

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

91

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 is designed to suggest that partisanship, political

2 lines should be certainly a secondary consideration to

3 a valid principled scheme and that perhaps in the

4 hypothetical case, you could reverse a district court

5 for abuse of discretion in -- in overemphasizing

6 political considerations. And then if that's true, it

7 means that there is some standard lurking out there

8 indicating that political considerations should be of

9 at least secondary importance.

10 MR. CRUZ: In this case, the district court

11 was presented with maps that would be more fair on --

12 on pretty much any measure of partisanship, and what

13 the district court concluded is it didn't have the

14 ability -- that making that judgment was a political

15 judgment, and it was the legislature's job to do it.

16 And so it drew in the districts it was required to draw

17 because Texas had two new districts. It drew in what

18 it believed the Voting Rights Act required, and beyond

19 that, it made as few changes as possible.

20 And so the district court recognized that the

21 consequence of that map-drawing technique is whatever

22 partisan bias was there before is reflected in its own

23 map that just neutrally carries over the preexisting

24 bias. And that's why the district court found it was

25 perpetuating the prior bias, not because it intended to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

92

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 do so, but because it was consciously restraining

2 itself from doing anything to alter the partisan

3 composition other than to carry over what was already

4 there.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: What -- district 24. I take

6 it -- it's a long walking stick is what it looks like.

7 And the -- I take it you're saying when I go back to

8 the record here, I'll discover a finding that the

9 district court made. They said this was not an effort

10 to use race to district. Is that right?

11 And one of the reasons that you think that is

12 because, although it's not a circle, it's not

13 absolutely terrible. That -- that is a supporter of

14 the ultimate conclusion they did not use race. Is that

15 right?

16 MR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, that's -- that's

17 exactly correct --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: Then -- then if I -- if I --

19 so I have to go back, look at the record, and see what

20 it says.

21 Now, suppose I came to a different

22 conclusion. Then you might still win on this point if

23 the rationale for using race to district was because we

24 want to avoid a section 2 violation. And there, you

25 would lose, however, because you can't use that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

93
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 rationale unless, according to Bush v. Vera, the

2 district that you draw is, in their words, reasonably

3 compact. So, again, you'd have to say that this

4 district that looks like a walking stick is reasonably

5 compact for that other purpose. Is that right?

6 MR. CRUZ: Well, although we would submit

7 this district is reasonably compact.

8 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, so I understand that.

9 But -- but if -- if I -- you have two bites at this

10 apple with your reasonably compactness. One, you want

11 to say it wasn't -- you think this proves it wasn't to

12 use race in the first place, but if I'm wrong on that,

13 it's still a legitimate use of race because it's a

14 reasonably compact effort to conform with section 2.

15 MR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, you're correct

16 that if the Court concludes this district is not

17 reasonably compact, then under its precedents, it

18 wouldn't be a narrowly tailored way to satisfy a voting

19 rights violation, but --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: And is there anything I can

21 look to to decide what reasonably compact means in that

22 second --

23 MR. CRUZ: Well, the district court's finding

24 was that Texas geography and population dispersion

25 limit the availability of district compactness in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

94
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 southern and western regions of the State, and that was

2 at the Jackson jurisdictional statement, page 154a. So

3 that's -- there's -- there's a challenge in Texas

4 because you've got these --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're talking about

6 district 25. Right?

7 MR. CRUZ: 25, yes. Yes, we're talking about

8 25.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, 25.

10 MR. CRUZ: 25 has seven whole counties and

11 only two county splits, which is unusual. Most of the

12 cases that this Court has struck down what it's

13 perceived to be racial gerrymanders have been a number

14 of county splits. In this case, the county splits --

15 those were mandated to -- because we have achieve

16 perfect equipopulosity, so we had to get exactly,

17 within one person, precise lines. But within -- in

18 between the two, they are whole contiguous counties

19 that are longstanding geographic units.

20 The testimony is clear that the -- the

21 legislature made no effort to avoid Anglo voters. It's

22 not like they snaked around. And even the lean of it

23 is a simple fact that the Gulf of Mexico leans like

24 this, and it follows the geographic boundaries of the

25 State, so that if one examines this district next to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

95

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the other districts, it follows historic lines that

2 have been used in Texas.

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: General Cruz, why wouldn't

4 it be a -- at least a helpful guide to what is

5 reasonably compact to compare with the preceding

6 district? Now, that fits 24 but not necessarily 25 I

7 understand. Wouldn't that make -- make sense if the

8 reasonable compactness is -- is one of the tests?

9 MR. CRUZ: One could certainly compare the

10 preceding district, and with respect to the preceding

11 district, the differential is -- is not great. It is

12 somewhat more compact.

13 But there were other policy agendas the

14 district court --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: When you're carved out of a

16 couple of preceding districts, which is the preceding

17 district? I mean, isn't -- isn't that a problem with

18 that test?

19 MR. CRUZ: That -- that is a certainly a

20 challenge.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: I suppose if you have a

22 plaintiff suing, it would be the one he lives in.

23 MR. CRUZ: You know, if you compare, for

24 example, district 25's perimeter-to-area score is 9.6.

25 You know, if -- if one looks at, for example, the plan

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

96

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 1385 submitted by GI Forum, that has one plan, district

2 -- one district, district 28, with a higher perimeter-

3 to-area score of -- of 10.0. And indeed, the district

4 court found as a factual matter that the demonstration

5 plan submitted by the GI Forum appellants was -- was

6 less compact and critically would not perform.

7 Going back to the section 2 question about

8 district 23, the district court found that one district

9 in the demonstration plan, district 28, had only a bare

10 majority of citizen voting population, 50.3 percent,

11 and there was undisputed testimony that for a district

12 to perform in this region, it had to have --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did they have --

14 why did have just 50.3 percent?

15 MR. CRUZ: Because the Hispanic population is

16 dispersed enough that one can't -- one can't draw --

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're doing that to

18 make it look like whoever was elected had Hispanic

19 support in that district? Is that --

20 MR. CRUZ: We did not ascribe motives to

21 them. They -- they drew it to demonstrate that -- that

22 you could draw a district with a bare majority of

23 citizen voting population, although their experts also

24 testified that a bare majority will not elect in this

25 region because of lower voter -- voter turnout.

1 JUSTICE BREYER: On the -- either it is

2 reasonably compact or it isn't. If it is reasonably

3 compact, we never get into Bush v. Vera, whatever, the

4 Vera case in the first place. And if it isn't, you

5 can't get out of it by saying it's an effort to cure a

6 section 2 violation.

7 MR. CRUZ: Correct, but with respect to the

8 question of racial gerrymandering, this Court's

9 question is, is race the predominant motivation?

10 There's a direct factual finding by the district court

11 that it was not. Indeed, the district court said that

12 the -- that the measures of compactness, examined in

13 relationship to the geography and population, reflect

14 the sheer size and population distribution of this

15 area, rather than a calculated stretch to find voters

16 of a particular ethnic makeup.

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean 25 -- the -- the

18 Latino makeup of 25 is accidental?

19 MR. CRUZ: It is a function of the population

20 in south and west Texas.

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's accidental.

22 MR. CRUZ: The -- it is not accidental in the

23 sense that the legislature was unaware of it, and as this

24 Court has said, whenever a legislature is districting,

25 it is aware of the -- the racial distribution. But it

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

98

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 was drawing an additional district there, and the

2 district court found that in drawing those lines, it

3 did not reach out to segregate voters on either side

4 based on race, that that was not its intent and that

5 was not the effect of what it in fact drew.

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what do you say to

7 Ms. Perales' argument that the -- the numbers are just

8 too precise to have been reflective of anything but a

9 racial motivation, and that, therefore, the -- the

10 district court's finding was clearly erroneous?

11 MR. CRUZ: Well, that -- that concerns

12 district 23, and -- and --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't they equally precise

14 here?

15 MR. CRUZ: No. District 25 is -- has a -- a

16 large majority on Hispanic voting age population and

17 also citizen voting age population.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I misspoke. Okay.

19 MR. CRUZ: With respect to district 23,

20 there's an unusual aspect to the GI Forum appellants'

21 argument in that it's unlike a typical racial

22 gerrymandering claim where they say you're -- you're

23 seeking to draw lines based on race. She's arguing

24 they should have been more aggressive drawing lines on

25 -- based on race, which is -- which is not an argument

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

99

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that sounds in the Shaw line of cases. What the

2 district court found is that it was purely a political

3 motivation that drew that decision, and if one is

4 looking to the Voting Rights Act, under any assessment,

5 the district is performing identically as it did

6 before.

7 And on the totality of circumstances, either

8 based on the region, in which case their argument --

9 argument is one for maximization -- they have six of

10 seven districts. They're arguing they're entitled to

11 seven of seven districts -- or on a statewide basis,

12 the district court found totality of the circumstances

13 was met.

14 With respect to district 24, the findings --

15 the -- two of the three findings, with respect to Anglo

16 bloc voting and cohesion, the appellants have made no

17 attempt to get around other than in their reply brief,

18 they have -- have briefly challenged them. But it was

19 their own expert who provided the information that the

20 district court found credible, that there was no

21 cohesion, that African Americans couldn't elect their

22 candidate of choice. And it is undisputed that in new

23 district 9, African Americans can elect their candidate

24 of choice. And so from a statewide -- from a totality

25 of circumstances perspective, the ability to elect a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

100

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 candidate of choice for African Americans in the State

2 is higher under this map than it was in the preceding

3 map.

4 In sum, the basic question here is whether

5 courts or legislatures are the principal decision-

6 makers. If appellants' proffered rule is adopted, it

7 removes the safety valve that the Constitution

8 provided. It is rarely employed because it is rare

9 that one finds a plan so out of step with the

10 demonstrated preferences of voters for a decade. We

11 are aware of no other plan that allowed a minority of

12 voters who never crossed the 44 percent threshold to

13 control the majority of the delegation. We're aware of

14 no other map in the country.

15 And so if there is a standard that this is

16 impermissible, that consequence would either elevate

17 courts above legislatures, contrary to the

18 constitutional text and to 4 decades of this Court's

19 precedents, or if it looks to substance, it would call

20 into question the districts in a host of other

21 districts because on any objective measure, the

22 districts in Texas are fair as a partisan matter,

23 compared to the other States, compared to the

24 predecessor map, compared to any metric that one

25 applies. Indeed, the social scientists say, based on

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

101

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the seats/votes curve, that given that Republican

2 voters are currently voting at roughly 60 percent for

3 Republican candidates, one would expect a higher

4 percentage of Republican candidates elected than --

5 than what this map is yielding. And so on any coherent

6 measure of a substantive measure of fairness, this map

7 should survive.

8 If there are no further questions.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Cruz.

11 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

12 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

13 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING APPELLEES

14 MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

15 may it please the Court:

16 The United States' participation in this case

17 is addressed to the Voting Rights Act issues, and our

18 position is that the district court properly concluded

19 that the 2003 plan does not unlawfully dilute minority

20 voting strength in either the Dallas/Fort Worth area or

21 the south and west region of the State. The district

22 court based that conclusion on factual findings that

23 are entitled to great respect on appeal and that

24 preclude appellants' section 2 claims under this

25 Court's decisions.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

102

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you if you agree

2 with General Cruz, that if the results of the 20 --

3 section -- district 23 violated section 2, it would not

4 be a defense that was politically motivated?

5 MR. GARRE: I -- I think that's right,

6 Justice Stevens, insofar as --

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: And would you also agree

8 with the second question I asked as to whether if it

9 were a violation -- I understand you don't think it was

10 -- it would not be a defense that they were able to

11 create a district -- a Hispanic district in another

12 part of the State.

13 MR. GARRE: Well, that's true in the context

14 that the Court said it in the Shaw II case, but we

15 don't think that the principle of Shaw II would apply

16 to the section 2 claim in the south and west part of

17 Texas in this case. And that's because in Shaw II, the

18 Court found a violation in the southern part of the

19 State and considered the question as to whether a

20 creation of a district in a completely different part

21 of the State, the middle of the State with no

22 connection, would remedy the section 2 violation, and

23 the Court said no.

24 This case deals with a section 2 claim which

25 is addressed to a particular region of the State, a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

103
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 region that's marked by its high concentration of

2 Hispanic citizen voting age population, as well as

3 common geography and other factors. And we know that

4 the claim is addressed to that particular region of the

5 State because that -- that region is the focus of the

6 plaintiffs' demonstration plan. Mr. Cruz referred to

7 it. It's at page 241 of the GI Forum jurisdictional

8 statement. That's the plan that they claim they're

9 entitled to under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,

10 and it's addressed to the entire part of the State.

11 So in that situation where you've got a claim

12 where you have a -- a Voting Rights Act section 2 claim

13 addressed to a particular region of the State, we don't

14 think that the Shaw II principle would come into a play.

15 Here, we don't think there's any section 2 violation

16 with respect to the elimination of --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that based on the

18 premise that section -- that district 25 and district

19 23 are in the same part of the State?

20 MR. GARRE: Yes, not just the same part of

21 the State, but a part of the State that falls within

22 the section 2 -- within the focus of the plaintiffs'

23 section 2 claim, and a part of the State that's marked

24 by its high concentration of minority citizen voting

25 age population.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

104

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 In -- in the De Grandy case, this Court

2 confronted a very similar problem where you had one

3 part of the State, the Miami-Dade area of Florida,

4 which had a high concentration of Hispanic citizen

5 voting age population, and the State was drawing

6 various districts in that part of the State. And the

7 Court looked to those districts and considered whether

8 there was a proportional representation of the minority

9 group in that area and -- and found that, under the

10 totality of the circumstances, there was, and

11 therefore, there was no violation of section 2.

12 Here, you have a situation where the district

13 court found that the citizen voting age population in

14 the south and west part of the State was 58 percent,

15 and that under the State's plan, Hispanics enjoyed 85

16 percent majority minority districts in that area, which

17 is to say, six of the seven districts under the State's

18 plans were districts in which Hispanics enjoyed a

19 majority of citizen voting age population.

20 The decision within that area of where to

21 draw district lines is a decision that section 2 and

22 this Court's precedents leaves up to the States. And,

23 in fact, in the De Grandy case, this Court in -- in

24 particular considered the situation where a district

25 line ran through a minority neighborhood and split up

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

105

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that neighborhood. The Court discussed it on page 1015

2 of its decision. And it said that the fact that the

3 district line went through that neighborhood and had an

4 effect on minority voters, in terms of which district

5 they went into, didn't in itself establish a section 2

6 violation.

7 And we think the same principle would apply

8 here, where the fact that the district lines separating

9 district 23 and 28 in the southern part of the State

10 near Laredo splits a Hispanic neighborhood, which is,

11 after all, not -- not surprising given that the large

12 percentage of the population in that part of the State

13 is Hispanic, doesn't in itself establish a section 2

14 violation.

15 The plaintiffs' section 2 claim in that part

16 of the State really sounds very much in a section 5

17 retrogression or dismantling claim, and this Court made

18 clear in the Holder v. Hall case that retrogression

19 principles of section 5 are not applicable in section 2

20 cases. And we certainly think that that principle

21 holds here and that --

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there cases that --

23 that we've issued from this Court that address what

24 happens in a case like this where the economic

25 circumstances and many other circumstances of the two

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

106

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Latino populations are very different? The border

2 Hispanics and the Hispanics in Austin have very -- very

3 little in common other than -- than the Latino

4 background. Are there -- are there cases that address

5 whether or not these populations can be combined in --

6 in order to satisfy the -- the Voting Rights Act

7 requirements?

8 MR. GARRE: Well, I don't know of a --

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Have we talked about that?

10 MR. GARRE: -- specific case that has

11 addressed that concern. I suppose it would go perhaps

12 to the cohesiveness analysis under the Gingles factors.

13 I mean, what -- what is clear under this

14 Court's cases and the text of section 2(b) is that the

15 Court has to take into account the totality of the

16 circumstances in the area, not just the rough

17 proportion -- the existence of proportionality between

18 the Hispanic population and the number of districts in

19 which they enjoy a majority, but all the circumstances

20 that could bear on the region.

21 And the district court in this case conducted

22 that analysis and it found, under the totality of the

23 circumstances, that there was an -- that there was not

24 a section 2 violation in the south and west region of

25 the State. And we certainly think that that finding is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

107

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 entitled to respect under the clearly erroneous

2 standard that this Court applies in reviewing findings of

3 -- ultimate findings of vote dilution. The Court has

4 -- has said repeatedly that it will not disturb such a

5 factual finding unless it is left with the definite and

6 firm conviction that a mistake has been made, and we

7 don't think the record in this case would support such

8 a conclusion with respect to either the section 2 claim

9 in the south and west or the section 2 claim in the

10 Dallas/Fort Worth area.

11 As we have explained in our brief, that claim

12 -- and I'm now turning to the Dallas/Fort Worth claim

13 -- fails because of the district court's finding that

14 African American voters in old congressional district

15 24 lacked the ability to elect candidates of choice in

16 that district in the sense that they would be unable,

17 in a contested election, to put their candidate, the

18 African American candidate, into office. That finding

19 too is supported by ample record evidence and we think

20 could not be set aside under the standard that this

21 Court applies.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: Is it possible it violates

23 section 2, the following? We look at the map as it's

24 drawn. We ask the question, is there a way to redraw

25 this map so that, say, the minority group has a more

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

108
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 significant influence for their bloc voting, et cetera,

2 et cetera? Gingles. Answer: Of course, there is.

3 It's the old way. And you say, well, why didn't you do

4 it the old way? Well, the only reason you didn't do it

5 the old way was pure politics and that that isn't a

6 sufficient justification.

7 MR. GARRE: Well, I don't think that would

8 bear on the typical section 2 analysis this Court

9 would apply. The -- the plaintiffs bear the burden of

10 coming in in a section 2 case, which is, after all, a

11 claim that the State is forced to draw a district in a

12 particular way, to show the demonstration district in

13 which the three Gingles factors can be met. And this

14 case is a little bit unusual in that instead of coming

15 up with a -- a new district, they've just pointed to

16 the old district, which in itself is -- is similar to

17 more of a section 5 claim.

18 But with respect to that district, the

19 district court failed -- failed to -- the district

20 court found that plaintiffs failed to meet the first

21 Gingles precondition, which is that they could not show

22 in that district that they had the ability to elect the

23 candidate of their choice because African Americans

24 were 22 percent of the population in that district, the

25 third largest racial group, and because other evidence,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

109

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 including the past elections in that district and

2 direct testimony of politicians with intimate

3 familiarity of that district, supported the logical

4 conclusion that a group that comprises only 22 percent

5 of the electorate --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: I was thinking of district

7 23.

8 MR. GARRE: Oh, I'm sorry. With respect to

9 district 23, again I -- I think the -- the framework

10 for the plaintiffs' challenge to section 23 is the

11 south and west region of the State in a claim that they

12 were entitled to a seventh -- a seventh effective

13 majority district in that part of the State. The

14 State's plan, 2003 plan, gives them six majority

15 minority districts. The plaintiffs, GI Forum --

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not -- not

17 including 23.

18 MR. GARRE: Not including 23. That's right,

19 Mr. Chief Justice.

20 They claim that they're entitled to a seventh

21 majority minority district. The district court

22 rejected that claim because it found that they had

23 failed to show that the seventh district that they drew

24 would be an effective district because it only had 50.3

25 percent citizen voting age population --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

110

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say they

2 drew, you mean the GI Forum proposal?

3 MR. GARRE: The GI Forum drew. That's right.

4 And again, that's at page 241 of the GI Forum

5 jurisdictional statement.

6 It found that that district was not effective

7 because it only had a 50.3 percent citizen voting age

8 population, and the district court found, based on the

9 testimony that showed that Hispanics have a

10 comparatively low turnout rate in elections, that a

11 50.3 percentage wouldn't do the trick to give them the

12 potential to elect.

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Garre.

14 MR. GARRE: Thank you.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Smith, you have 4

16 minutes remaining.

17 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

18 ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 05-276

19 MR. SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

20 As I understand the State's argument, it is

21 that the rational, legitimate governmental purpose that

22 was served in passing a new map in 2003 was to

23 eliminate an anti-majoritarian map drawn by the Federal

24 district court in 2001. I submit to you that's an odd

25 use of the word in a couple of different senses.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

111
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 First of all, as the experts for both sides

2 found and as the court itself found, that -- the court-

3 drawn map was not unfair or biased in any way. It did

4 not in any way maldistribute voters in a way that --

5 that hurt -- hurt Republicans' chances to elect Members

6 of Congress. So when Mr. Cruz says that the problem

7 with the old map was that a minority of voters were

8 controlling the delegation, that is factually untrue.

9 What happened was that Republican districts

10 chose to elect moderate to conservative Members of

11 Congress who happened to be affiliated with the

12 Democratic Party rather than the Republican Party, but

13 that does not mean that Democrats were controlling the

14 delegation.

15 The anti-majoritarian name is odd in another

16 way because the map that replaced it, of course, is

17 terribly anti-majoritarian, as the experts for both

18 sides agreed. It totally flunks any -- any kind of

19 standard analysis about bias in a map to the point

20 where it locks in 22 to 10 regardless, essentially, of

21 how anybody votes in the State of Texas, and it's going

22 to produce majorities that are going to average about

23 -- margins of victory that are about 40 percent in --

24 for the rest of the decade, even if the Democrats gain

25 votes over time.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

112

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Now, it's a dangerous road we're going down,

2 I submit to you, if we start authorizing this kind of

3 partisan festival every couple of years adjusting the

4 lines. Now, we've had three States redo their

5 congressional districts already in this decade, and if

6 this Court were to uphold this one, I think we'll start

7 seeing lots and lots of other ones tit for tat around

8 the country.

9 There's another particular aspect of this

10 that I think is potentially dangerous, which is as you

11 get further into the decade, the census numbers get

12 older and older and more and more out-of-date. And

13 what the line-drawers then do is they've got the census

14 numbers over here, they know where the real people are

15 over here, and they can exploit that differential using

16 the old census numbers. So it seems to me that even if

17 you're going to say there's a legitimate public purpose

18 for redrawing the lines through the decade, we ought to

19 require the States to come up with fresh numbers. The

20 population -- one person/one vote requirements are so

21 incredibly strict in the congressional area. Simply to

22 sort of assume that these people can use the old

23 numbers when they're redrawing the lines 5 years after

24 the census seems -- seems mistaken to me and it does

25 invite terrible abuse. There -- and there are

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

113

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 mechanisms for getting new census numbers if the States

2 really feel it's important to do so.

3 Let me then turn, if I might, quickly to

4 respond, I think, to Justice Stevens' question about

5 what the record shows about the intent for taking the

6 -- the African American community in Fort Worth and

7 sending it up to Oklahoma, so to speak. That intent is

8 set forth in pages 87 to 88 of the jurisdictional

9 statement appendix where the map-drawer himself -- his

10 testimony is quoted, and he explained that we had to

11 find a Republican district in the -- in the

12 neighborhood that we could -- we could tack them onto

13 that could sort -- that could, quote, handle that

14 particular component of the current county population,

15 which is to say a district sufficiently Republican that

16 they would be completely disempowered for the rest of

17 the decade.

18 Now, there was -- there was a comment from

19 Mr. Cruz about how the district 24 was created for a

20 Anglo -- Anglo Democrat to win. The district that --

21 that was talked about in the testimony was the district

22 drawn in 1991. What Mr. Cruz didn't point out was that

23 in 1996, that district was completely changed by a

24 Federal district court in Bush v. Vera. The old

25 district went way down into the southeast into the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

114
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 countryside. The new district, which is the one you

2 see in the maps before you, was drawn by the Federal

3 district court. It wasn't drawn by anybody seeking to

4 uphold any Anglo Democrats' opportunities.

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who was the -- who

6 was the -- the candidate in that district after the

7 district court plan?

8 MR. SMITH: Mr. Frost continued to run in

9 that district, Your Honor.

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, didn't the

11 district court say one of its criteria was preserving

12 incumbency?

13 MR. SMITH: That's a different Federal

14 district court. I was talking about the -- the Bush v.

15 Vera court was the one that redrew it, Your Honor, not

16 the -- not the one that's in 2001.

17 Thank you, Your Honor.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Smith.
