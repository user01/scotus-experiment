    "speech": "We'll hear argument next in No. 01-455, Franconia Associates v. the United States, and the Grass Valley Terrace v. United States. Mr. Eckland."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has held that statutes of limitations involve fundamental considerations of fairness. Petitioners submit that the cases before Your Honors this morning involve precisely that. In these two civil actions, petitioners seek fair compensation for continuing to be bound to the Section 515 housing program and continuing to house low- income tenants for up to 50 years. Petitioners can succeed in obtaining that fair compensation only if this Court continues to apply the same ordinary principles of law to the United States Government that it applies to United States citizens. The ordinary principles of law and their continuing application to the United States Government that are at issue here are, first, that a breach of contract claim does not accrue until the date of breach; that is, until the time for performance by the defendant arrives and the defendant fails to perform."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Eckland, you -- you began by saying you're seeking fair compensation for something. Which is it? Are you seeking fair compensation for the Government's violation of the Constitution by impairing the obligation of contracts, or are you simply seeking your contractual rights? Are you seeking a contract claim? Which -- what do we have before us?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "We are -- Justice Scalia, we are seeking compensation for the breach of contract."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Okay. So, it's a -- it's a simple contract case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Very much so, Your Honor. I mean, included in the compensation that the petitioners are seeking, it was not merely the lost income because of their lost right to opt out, but given the situation, petitioners are not receiving really sufficient income to even cover the costs of maintaining the housing for their current tenants."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Do you think you have a separate cause of action for the Government's violation of the Constitution, assuming that -- that you're correct that that's what it's done?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Under the takings claim, Justice Scalia?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, no, not the takings. But -- but impairing the obligation of contracts."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Oh, quite so, Your Honor, yes. We believe that although it's for purposes --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "This is a -- this is a Federal contract?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "It is with the Department of Agriculture, Your Honor, through the Farmers Home Administration."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So, the impairment clause doesn't apply."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Well, it -- it comes -- no. That only applies to the States."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "My difficulty with your argument is that if you have -- your whole property claim here rests upon the contract. And if you have a contract claim, then your contract will be enforceable. If you don't have a contract claim, then I'm not sure what the source of your property taking is on the -- on the unconstitutionality claim."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Well, petitioners pled, Justice Souter, the takings claim in the alternative to the breach of contract claim. And in fact, the lower courts have held that there is no enforceable contract here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, if -- if they are correct, then I don't see how you've got a taking because your -- your whole property interest -- the only property interest you're asserting is an interest under that contract. And if you haven't got the -- if you have no breach of contract, then I don't see what's being taken from you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "What's being taken, Justice Souter, is the expected use of the petitioners' properties. What happened is they volunteered to a certain period of time --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If you don't have a contract for it, you have no right to expect it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "But there were representations by the Government that created a reasonable investment-backed expectation on the part of --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why did the lower courts find that there was no contract claim? Because of the statute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Because of the -- one judge, in particular, because of the unmistakability doctrine."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Because of the --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "In other words, the contract was not clear enough to constitute an enforceable contract with the Government."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I thought the Federal Circuit went on the statute of limitations. Isn't that what you're opposing, that the statute of limitations didn't expire?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor. The lower court opinions were denying our motion for summary judgment, so we've not been able to get to trial on the existence of the contract. Assuming for the purposes of our case that there is a contract, the Federal Circuit did affirm the dismissal on the basis of the statute of limitations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes. The question you presented is whether a breach of contract claim accrues for purposes of section -- when Congress enacts a statute alleged to abridge a contractual right to freedom from regulatory covenants upon prepayment of Government mortgage loans. Basically the -- the court held that your -- the statute of limitations barred your contract claim, didn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "That is true, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And that's the case we have here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Well, in -- yes. Yes, it is, Judge, a statute of limitations case. In our case, the petitioners alleged that their claims accrued when they tried to prepay and when the Farmers Home Administration failed to accept their prepayment requests and refused to release them from the regulatory covenants imposed by the Section 515 program. Petitioners all commenced suit within 6 years of that date, and therefore they maintain here that their claims are timely. Now, the Government maintains that the petitioners' claims accrued not on the date dictated by the ordinary principles of law, breach of contract and takings, but rather automatically in the enactment of the 1988 legislation. But if you look at -- closely at the 1988 legislation, it's clear that it has no immediate impact whatsoever on the owners. All of its commands, directives, requirements, and authorizations are directed solely at the agency."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Didn't the Federal Circuit rely on anticipatory breach?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor. They maintained that the actual passage of the -- of the statute constituted an automatic breach. They did not rely on the anticipatory breach."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You were relying on anticipatory breach, as I understand it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "We do not either, Your Honor, although the petitioners here have the option of suing -- assuming -- suing before the breach, assuming that they had the ability to perform at that time -- and there's nothing in the record --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You rely on the notion that before they went to pay it off, it was an anticipatory breach."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "No, Judge. We are relying on the actual breach. All petitioners --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I'm sorry. Then I'm confused. I thought that your argument was that the reason the statute of limitations doesn't arise, doesn't start to run prior to the time that they paid it off, is because prior to that time, there was no actual breach. There was only an anticipatory breach."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Correct, yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "All right. That's what I thought Justice Ginsburg was asking."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Now, but you take the position that your clients could have filed suit soon after the passage of ELIHPA."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Justice O'Connor, not necessarily. Under the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation, they did have a option to sue before. But as we pointed out in footnote --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, that's what I'm asking you. You take the position -- let's be clear about your -- please -- that after the enactment of the statute, your clients could have filed suit for breach of contract on an anticipatory breach theory?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Yes, but only if they had the ability to prepay at that time. One of the requirements of -- of the contract is that the petitioners had the requisite funds to prepay before submitting a prepayment request."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, no, no, no, no, no."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "That is --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You -- you don't -- you don't -- no. You have to -- you say for anticipatory breach you have to show that you're ready to --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Ready, willing, and able, Judge."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- to perform when -- when the obligation to perform comes. You -- you don't have to show that you're ready for immediate performance."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "You do have to show that you're -- but for the repudiation, you do have to show that you are able to perform."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But performance here -- what you're talking about here in performance means the ability to prepay. And I take it your argument is we couldn't have prepaid because we didn't have the money, and therefore we couldn't have proved damages. Is -- is that it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Essentially so, Your Honor. We don't rely on --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I have a contract to deliver 100,000 widgets 3 years from now. The party who -- the party who is committed to buy those widgets announces I am not going to buy those widgets, and you say there is no anticipatory breach unless I have on hand the 100,000 widgets, which I have no obligation to deliver until 3 years from now. That's -- that's how you envision the -- the law of anticipatory breach? I'm sure that's wrong."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Well, no. Well, footnote 23. We address this in our reply brief, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The whole purpose of anticipatory breach -- most people use it not to get damages but to relieve themselves of the obligation of -- of remaining in -- in the status of being able to perform the contract. The person who would sue in the case that I gave you would be suing so that he wouldn't have to go and acquire the 100,000 -- the 100,000 widgets. It's never the case that he's ready -- or almost never the case that he's ready here and now to perform."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "But, Your Honor, if the person who had the obligation to accept the delivery did not have the funds, for example, even to purchase them, then that would be sort of almost a fraudulent --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "He didn't need the funds until 3 years from now. He has no obligation to purchase until 3 years from now."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Could we agree to this? Could we agree to this, that so far as the element of an anticipatory breach claim involves the act of the Government, you had that element, and at least to that extent, you could have brought an anticipatory breach claim when the statute was passed? Maybe you didn't have other elements. That's what we're arguing about, but you had the -- you had the -- the Government's fault element. Is that correct? Do you agree?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Well, certainly, Justice Souter, the --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But you're saying, whether I could have sued then or not, I certainly can sue at the point at which I would claim my right to redeem without these various conditions, and they refused to honor it. You're saying, even if I could have sued when the statute was passed, I can also under contract principles sue when the moment comes that I want to exercise my right to prepay."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Correct, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Okay."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "And -- and the doctrine does not require you to sue until that date. It's merely an option to sue prior to that date."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So, you're arguing for total control then over timing because your client could say, we're not ready after 5 years, we're not ready after 7 years, we're not ready after 10 years. So, the statute would -- would never run. In other words, you're asking for any time from the earliest, which is when the law is passed, until, say, 20 years later."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, we are."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So, you could --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Because the Government negotiated option terms up to 50 years."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That was the deal."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "And the owners relied on that when they signed up, and they had, you know, a clear expectation that at some point in time they would be able to prepay, opt out, and convert their markets --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "May -- may I interrupt you?"
  },

    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "-- to market rate -- yes."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Did they have a right to assume right after the -- the day after the statute was passed, did they continue to have a right to prepay --"

    "speech": "The right --"
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- without any objection?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Well, the right still existed, Your Honor, but it wasn't -- it was repudiated at the time of the statute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, it wasn't just -- it's not like a private citizen saying, I don't intend to perform 3 years from now. You have a law passed that takes away a certain contract right. Was there a breach when the law was passed?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, petitioners maintain that the right was not eliminated. It was, if you will, conditioned --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Do you maintain there was no breach at the time the law was passed?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor. That's merely repudiation. The breach did not occur unless and until the prepayment request was submitted and denied."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But you would concede that the statute changed your rights."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "The statute did condition them, and that conditioning, or fettering as the Government says, is a repudiation, but like any other situation in the private sector, when you repudiate a right, the breach doesn't occur until the time for performance comes due."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The repudiation --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, that's because a private party has the right to change his mind."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Correct. Right, the defendant could change their mind or the petitioner here could, in fact, be able to --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Doesn't the Government have the right to change its mind? Couldn't the Government pass another statute going back to what the situation was before this one?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Yes, Justice Scalia."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "In fact, it did that at one point, didn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "They could and they did."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "They did at one point, didn't they?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "In 1979 they initially conditioned the right, and in 1980 they repealed it, retracted it. Now, under the Government's proposed rule, if -- if the statute of limitations began to run immediately upon the enactment of the statute, all of the petitioners here would have been compelled to file their suit within 6 years of 1979, i.e., by 1985."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So, we're arguing about whether a statute itself, without any action from the agency, can be a repudiation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "We believe it can be a repudiation, yes, Mr. Chief Justice. But the breach does not ripen, if you will, unless and until the prepayment request is denied."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Does the repudiation give you the right to the same damages that you would receive for a total breach of the contract?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "In our case, no. The petitioners maintain that since the housing is within a restricted program, it really has no market value unless and until a petitioner actually attempts to prepay. But even assuming, Your Honor, that there was some type of damage caused by the enactment of the statute, still the limitations period would not commence to run until the time for performance came and was not rendered."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I think it's usually the case, is it not, that when there's an anticipatory repudiation, it's -- it's very difficult for the -- the other party to determine what his damages are going to be."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Very difficult."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Which is why he uses the doctrine to get out of the contract rather than to seek damages. In the widget case I gave you, who knows? Who knows what 3 years from now the price of widgets will be? So -- so you use it to get out of the contract."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Petitioners here, being in the Court of Federal Claims, have as their only remedy the monetary judgment. And -- and they are seeking damages starting only as of the date that their prepayment request was denied by the agency. So --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So are you -- you're saying that there was a claim, or you're saying that -- that your claim really doesn't accrue until you -- until you have the -- the wherewithal to prepay. So, you don't really have a ripe claim until then?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "We're saying the petitioners would at least have to have the money to prepay. They would have to have the ability to perform. You couldn't have a situation, for example, where someone was unable to prepay, they experienced repudiation and a breach, a later breach, and then say, well, we would have performed if you hadn't repudiated."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well --"

    "speech": "I have a problem with that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But let's get -- if we can get -- for the same reason Justice Scalia mentioned. But let's assume you had cash in the bank that would allow you to prepay, and then there's a repudiation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Sure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "At that point, can't you show your damages? You don't want to prepay, but can't you say -- have an expert in and say, this property has a certain value and part of the value is the right at any time to prepay the -- the loan and use it for another use? And this can be valued in the real estate market. It's worth more if I can prepay than if -- if I can't, and you have some expert come in and tell you the difference in the values. And you do that at the moment the repudiation occurs."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "But here, Justice Kennedy, a 50- year option exists. Petitioners don't know, frankly -- they didn't know in 1979 and many didn't know in 1988 what the value of their properties would be, given interest rate structures and other market conditions at any given point in time --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, you mean 50-year options are not subject to valuation? Experts do this all the time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Well, but even so, even if you could come up with a damage theory to cover this, still it's clear that under the law, the breach would not be deemed to accrue for limitations purposes until the time for performance has arrived and performance failed. I mean, if you take a hypo of the GSA leasing some space in a building --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You're -- you're just getting me confused again. I thought we established that you thought a suit could have been filed for anticipatory breach of some kind after the statute was enacted."

    "speech": "If they're able to perform, yes, Your Honor."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "In general, yes, that's true, Your Honor. But here the petitioners sued within 6 years of the actual breach."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And in fact, you did not sue until after the passage of 6 years."

    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Technically --"
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Fine. And so, what they say, in part, which I'd like to hear your response, is if you're right that where there is anticipatory repudiation of a contract, the other side, if it's a private contract, has a choice. They can either sue immediately if conditions X, Y, and Z are fulfilled, or they wait until the contract is actually breached. But we are the Government and we have to interpret this statute strictly, and therefore we interpret it to mean that even if where you're dealing with a private person, you'd have your choice; here there's no choice. Now, your response is what?"

As this Court held in Irwin and in Bowen against New York, the tolling -- equitable tolling principles at issue in those cases, which applied to the private sector, were nonetheless deemed to apply to the Government, despite the strict construction of the statute of limitations involved in those cases. Here there is -- although there's a conditioning of the right at the point of the repudiation, no breach occurs until the performance comes due and is not rendered. If -- again, if you look at the statute, under ELIHPA, page 74 of our appendix 4a, all of its directives are towards the Secretary. For example, the Secretary shall make reasonable efforts to enter into an agreement with the borrower to extend the term of the -- of the contract. It's the Secretary that needs to make those reasonable efforts. There's no directive directly to the owner that the owner participate in that process."

But -- but it just -- it confuses your -- your primary claim, which is the contract claim. I don't see why there -- if it's only a conditional reduction and if it's only a direction to the agency, I don't see why there was an anticipatory breach then. It seems to me that what you need for a taking, you need for an anticipatory breach. I don't see how you can say it was enough for an anticipatory breach, but it wasn't enough for a taking."

That is to say, wouldn't you, if you win -- and this will help me understand it -- have millions of people who have entered into contracts with the Government poring over every law that is passed, and probably every regulation, to decide whether or not that law and that regulation will somehow 10 or 15 years from now impact on a real estate contract they have with the Government? A whole industry of anticipatory breach, not really, lawyers will develop in order to bring those claims immediately in the Court of Claims because we might lose them later even though everything would have been worked out. Now, if you can explain that to me, I suspect I'll have a better time understanding your argument."

What -- what we're -- what we're asking for is that people who believe that their contractual rights have been injured -- have been infringed by a statute give the Government reasonably prompt notice, in accordance with the statute of limitations, of their claims. And the benefit of the ability to have a prompt accounting outweighs, in the Government's view, any additional lawsuits that may result. And we don't think that there will be a significant number of additional lawsuits because, as the Court was explaining before, there's an ability to sue immediately on the anticipatory repudiation theory. So, it isn't that the petitioners -- or that the Government is not going to be subject to suit or --"

And after ELIHPA was passed, that loan no longer had that unfettered option to prepay. And a loan that has an -- has an absolute prepayment option is worth more than a loan with a severely restricted prepayment option.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Easy to measure? You -- you'd bet your life on that? I mean, the -- the reason -- the reason contract law has developed the option of suing for anticipatory breach as just an option is precisely because it is often so difficult to anticipate what your damages will be. And so, it leaves it up to the innocent party who hasn't broken the contract to either sue immediately, if he can calculate his damages and get them, or to wait until the -- the time for performance comes. And what the Government is doing with this theory is forcing everybody who has a contract with the Government to come in with -- with speculative damages and hoping that some court will find a difference between the value of this contract now and what it would be 50 years from now. I -- I think it's a -- I don't know why you would want to impose this kind of a regime upon contractors with the Government."

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "With -- with due respect, Your Honor, I -- I don't think that's the reason why the law gives the -- the option to the innocent party.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

You're saying there is always an implicit term that they won't monkey around with the terms of the contract, and whenever in anticipation they do so, there's an immediate breach.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

If -- if a -- if a private party had promised that you could prepay, that the other party could prepay at any time, and Congress passed a statute that imposed restrictions on prepayment, that statute would be neither an anticipatory repudiation or a breach, but would provide a discharge. And -- but if the private party had promised, subsidiary to the promise that it would be prepaid at any time, that there -- that notwithstanding passage of legislation, that if -- if there was legislation passed that -- that -- excuse me -- that the private party had promised that legislation wouldn't be passed or had promised to indemnify, notwithstanding the passage of legislation, then there would be a breach at the time the legislation is passed.

But I think your argument is that unlike private contracts, many, many, many Government contracts have the following problem in them which was in Mobil. Are the parties here saying that if Congress passes a law, that that -- all bets are off? Are they saying the Government promises to do this, Congress's law to the contrary in the future notwithstanding? What's the promise? And here you're saying the promise was in their view we will do this irrespective of Congress's new law and their -- your view is, no, it was conditioned on Congress not passing a law. Is that right?

It would apply to administrative regulations if -- if that was the -- the issue whether the promise -- if -- if the issue was there wouldn't be regulations -- different regulations that imposed restrictions on prepayment. It would apply to that and it would be breached at the time the regulations were promulgated. They have the effect of law. The authority for that is the -- is the background principle that's -- that's recognized in the Winstar case, that's recognized in Bowen v. Posse, that's recognized in --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "All right. But if it's just a background principle, I would worry about the practical consequence being of people, particularly in real estate contracts, having to study every regulation, every statute in order to tell their clients what to do. Real estate investors are nervous people sometimes. And -- and they would say, my God, I better bring a lawsuit and the lawyer would say, don't worry about it. This condition is never going to arise anyway. Who cares? And if it does, sue then. Now, that -- that's the practical thing I brought up at the beginning, and if we're trying to say what's the right legal principle, I think that practical problem is relevant."

And then to return to the -- to practical considerations that -- that we think argue in our favor on that side, that's because the Government has a prompt interest in -- has a -- has a strong interest in a prompt accounting of the costs of legislative action.

You seem to say that legislation is magic, and you can't have an anticipatory repudiation because when Congress has spoken, that's it. But in this very case, Congress goes back and forth a couple of times."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Yes. Congress can repeal the legislation, but it doesn't change the fact that during the -- the period the legislation was in effect that there's an alteration of legal rights, and there's also, if there was a promise that -- that the -- that the rights wouldn't be changed, a breach during that time. And although Congress did -- although Congress did repeal the statute here, it -- it's far less likely in the ordinary situation that Congress is going to repeal statutes than it is that a private party is going to change its mind about its intention to repudiate a -- a contract, and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, Mr. -- Mr. Roberts, in the case in which the Government, we'll assume, doesn't change its mind, your argument in -- in response to Justice Breyer's question seems to boil down to something like this. Pity the poor Government as the contract breaker because it may not know just how much damage it's causing. Therefore, put a burden on the people harmed by the Government's breach of contract to run in in a hurry and let the Government know early on just how much damage it has caused. Why should the burden of the Government's breach of contract be shifted entirely for limitations purposes to the victims of the breach?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but your -- no, but your argument, as I understand it, is that because of the Government's peculiar power to pass legislation, the Government should not be in the position of the usual contract breaker who may be subject to an anticipatory breach claim or an actual breach claim later. You're saying the Government should be subject only to one claim at the first moment that an anticipatory breach claim should be brought. And your argument for saying that is the Government ought to have a right to make its victims come in and tell it as early as possible how much damage it has caused. Why does the Government, simply because it has a legislative power, have that kind of a moral claim that the private contract breaker does not have?"

  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well -- well, it -- there's a dispute here as to whether the contract made this promise or not, and the Government doesn't -- doesn't know how that dispute is going to be resolved. We don't believe that -- that there was a promise that prepayment would not be subject to subsequent legislation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, certainly general contract law is not -- you know, you could say it from the point of view of general contract law, it's important that people who breach contracts know as soon as possible how much damage they've done, but obviously that doctrine has not commended itself in the area of general contract law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, when they breach a contract and it's a breach, the statute of limits does start to run and the rule is that even if the damages can't be fully ascertained, that -- that the statute of limitations run. And that's true with -- if -- if there was a contract between one party to -- to employ another party for the other party's life and that contract was breached, the statute of limitations would run at the date of breach even though it wouldn't be possible with certainty to know the length of the damages. A -- a contract for a breach of warranty of merchantability --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I think it's so hard to look at this as an actual breach if we take it on the assumption there was a contractual right of prepayment on demand by the borrower. I would think normally you would wait and see if and when there was a request for repayment -- or early payment, and you wouldn't really know that, of course, with a -- the owner of real estate who goes out and he gets a low interest loan from the Government to develop it. Now, if interest rates decline below that low rate in the future within the 20-year period, then he might well want to go have early payment so he can get an even better deal. But if interest rates are going higher, there's no incentive for him to. I wouldn't think you'd treat it as an immediate breach because the Congress attached new conditions to the circumstances of the prepayment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No. As I read the legislation, there still is consideration of the possibility of prepayment, but there are some new conditions imposed whereby the Government tries to assure itself that there will still be a certain number of low-income housing units out there on the market."

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, but petitioners here aren't complaining about the fact that they're ultimately not able to prepay. They're really complaining about the -- about the restriction in the circumstances under which they prepaid, and -- and that's revealed by their complaint where not all -- even -- petitioners have -- have submitted requests for prepayment. And some of them have accepted incentives with -- and withdrawn their requests.

    "speaker": "ECKLAND",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. May it please the Court: The Government has not been able to cite to one case in which a congressional statute has been treated differently, in other words, that it constitutes an immediate breach of a contract. In the petitioners' briefs, we have a total of six cases that make the distinction between a congressional statute as being merely a repudiation and the breach not occurring until there has been some adverse agency action. In the Court of Federal Claims, we've got Plaintiffs in Winstar-Related cases, Bank of America, and Conoco. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, Far West, Schism, and Stone Forrest. And two of those cases, Plaintiffs in Winstar-Related cases and Bank of America, dealt with the statute of limitations and have ruled in favor of the petitioners' position advocated here. Congress makes policy. It directs agencies what to do, and petitioners maintain that in that sense it is no real different than a board of directors of a corporation. A board of directors can direct the CEO or a program manager not to perform a contract, but that directive or that change in bylaw by a board of directors does not constitute a breach. It's merely a repudiatory act. The -- the breach does not ripen unless and until the program manager or CEO actually fails to perform at the time that performance comes due. Here it's clear that since the petitioners can reach their central right of opting out of this program upon prepayment -- and the statistics show that -- it can't be that the statute is an immediate breach. A breach occurs only if and when the agency acts and denies a prepayment request. In closing, Your Honors, petitioners here understand that as U.S. citizens they have an obligation to follow the law and to know the law. But here the Government enticed the petitioners into this program by holding out a 50-year option term, only to withdraw it upon the time that the petitioners built the properties. If the Government is not willing to give the petitioners the benefit of their bargain, fundamental considerations of fairness at least require that they get the benefit of the doubt and that these ordinary principles of law regarding the accrual of breach of contract and takings claims should be able to be invoked by the petitioners such that they do not need to file suit unless and until their claims accrue."
