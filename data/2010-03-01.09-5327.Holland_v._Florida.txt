1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:02 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 4 argument next in Case 09-5327, Holland v. Florida. 5 Mr. Scher. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD G. SCHER 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. SCHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 9 please the Court: 10 It is undisputed that Petitioner was not 11 provided notice that the State supreme court had denied 12 his postconviction appeal and had issued its mandate, 13 with the result being that his AEDPA statute of 14 limitations expired. The very day he learned this, 15 Petitioner immediately prepared a pro se habeas petition 16 and filed it within 24 hours. Before this, Petitioner 17 had taken -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do -- what in the 19 record shows us that the failure to tell him that by the 20 lawyer was anything other than negligence? What in the 21 record suggests that the lawyer, just as many lawyers 22 do, forgot to call the client, forgot to send him 23 something? What shows that this is more than 24 negligence? 25 MR. SCHER: Well, first of all, we have what

1 the Eleventh Circuit characterized Mr. Collins's conduct 2 as, which was gross negligence. And what we have here 3 is a confluence -4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I'm trying to find 5 the basis for that finding. 6 MR. SCHER: We have a repeated pattern. For 7 example, first of all we have to go back in terms of what 8 happened in State court. First we have Mr. Collins's 9 assurances to Mr. Holland that he would in fact file his 10 Federal -- or was aware of this -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but -12 MR. SCHER: I'm sorry. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what his intent 14 was. 15 MR. SCHER: Correct. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: People say I'm going to 17 do something, and they fail to do it often because 18 something else comes up, because something has happened. 19 That doesn't show intentionality in -- the failure to 20 act doesn't necessarily prove that it was intentional. 21 MR. SCHER: Well -- well, in terms of that 22 what we have here, for example, is Mr. Collins was given 23 two opportunities -- or the record shows that there were 24 two opportunities for Mr. Collins to provide answers to 25 these very questions. The most significant of those

Official
1 responses was -- was in the Federal district court where 2 the Federal district judge in fact issued a show cause 3 order to Mr. Collins asking him to respond specifically 4 to Mr. Holland's allegations. And in that response Mr. 5 Collins completely ignored all of Mr. Holland's 6 allegations. He never denied that -- being instructed 7 to file the petition. He never denied that he had in 8 fact informed Mr. Holland that he wouldn't -- that he 9 would file the petition. He never denied any of the 10 allegations with regard to the fact that Mr. Holland 11 wanted that Federal habeas petition filed on time. He 12 just went on to address -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that -- but that's 14 the case in every case where -- where the lawyer is 15 negligent and doesn't do something that -- that should 16 have been done. 17 MR. SCHER: Well -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: He has assured the client, 19 I will take care of your case, and he doesn't do it. 20 MR. SCHER: Well, here we have -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's all that happened 22 here. 23 MR. SCHER: This -- this goes beyond the 24 case of mere, garden-variety negligence that some of the 25 courts have -- have addressed, because here we have a
5 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 combination of not only a failure -- we have the failure 2 to notify Mr. Holland that the State supreme court has in 3 fact denied its opinion, despite repeated instructions 4 from Holland to Mr. Collins that he file his petition. 5 Mr. Holland wrote -6 JUSTICE ALITO: The facts here -- the facts 7 here are quite extreme, but I am troubled by where you 8 think the line should be drawn. If it is just mere 9 negligence, would that be enough for equitable tolling? 10 MR. SCHER: No, courts -- and this Court in 11 Lawrence has held, for example, that mere negligence is 12 not sufficient. What we have here certainly is 13 suggestive -14 JUSTICE ALITO: Well -- the difference 15 between mere negligence and gross negligence -- one of the 16 things I remember most clearly from torts in law school 17 is that that's pretty -- that's an ephemeral 18 distinction. But that's the one you one you think we 19 should draw, between mere -- if it's gross negligence, 20 then there's equitable tolling; if it's mere negligence, 21 it's not? 22 MR. SCHER: Well, we know certainly that the 23 floor from -- from cases from this Court and from other 24 courts is this mere or garden-variety negligence. But 25 when you get to other factors --

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why should -- why should 2 that be? Two cases. Two criminal defendants. One 3 spends a lot of time trying to find the most competent 4 lawyer he can, and he does. He finds a highly skilled 5 lawyer, who makes one little mistake and it's 6 negligence. 7 The other doesn't care. He gets a lawyer 8 that's really incompetent, and the lawyer is grossly 9 negligent. 10 Now, you would be penalizing the client who 11 exercised the most diligence under your rule. I don't 12 understand the -- the justice of that. It seems to me 13 that the first client should be better off, not worse. 14 Now, maybe this is for your friend on the 15 other side to answer as well, but I'm not sure, even 16 following Justice Alito's initial line of questioning, 17 we can distinguish between gross and mere 18 negligence, that -- that it's even fair that we do so. 19 MR. SCHER: Well, this Court -20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't mean to interrupt 21 his line of questioning, but it seems to be consistent 22 with it. 23 MR. SCHER: This and other courts have -24 have been able to draw that line, and, of course you have 25 to look at the specifics of each particular case,
7 Alderson Reporting Company

1 because not only -2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what's the -- what's 3 the point? What's the justice in doing that? 4 MR. SCHER: Well, the way -5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than just limit 6 the number of cases in which we are going to set aside 7 convictions? 8 MR. SCHER: Well, in some circumstances, 9 courts have just said, unfortunately you lose, your 10 attorney didn't commit -- it was just a mere mistake. 11 But what we have here, of course, is not -- we don't 12 have a mere mistake; we have a confluence of these 13 particular factors. And I think one of the more salient 14 points that distinguishes Mr. Holland's case, for 15 example, from Lawrence and from the situation in 16 Coleman, is that Mr. Holland tried to rid himself of Mr. 17 Collins on numerous occasions while this case was in 18 State court. In Lawrence and in Coleman, the 19 petitioners were not allowed to be free of their 20 lawyers; they accepted those lawyers' representation -21 they accepted their representation and the acts and 22 omissions that occurred in Lawrence and in Coleman were 23 attributed to -- to the petitioners in those cases. 24 Here, however, by contrast, Mr. Holland did 25 everything he could -- he could, to be -- reasonably, to

1 be free of -2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -- are you 3 suggesting that there should be a different standard for 4 those habeas petitioners who are -- whose counsel is 5 appointed for them by the State or by the Federal 6 government, as opposed to just a lawyer they hire? 7 That's what I'm hearing you say. 8 MR. SCHER: No, and I didn't mean to suggest 9 that -10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So if the 11 standard is going to be the same -- I -- I go back to 12 Justice Alito's question, which is, the Eleventh Circuit 13 is saying negligence/gross negligence, the line is too 14 fine to draw. But there is a difference in a line 15 between negligence, however one defines it, and an 16 intentional, bad faith, dishonest, conflicted 17 malfeasance. 18 MR. SCHER: Correct. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Why isn't 20 that a more workable line, given that you can't have 21 equitable tolling without exceptional circumstances? 22 MR. SCHER: Correct enough, but I think 23 each -- well, certainly those were some of the 24 individual factors that the Eleventh Circuit discussed 25 when saying gross negligence isn't enough. I think in
9 Alderson Reporting Company

1 Mr. Holland's case -2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You haven't argued why 3 not, is what I'm saying to you. If exceptional 4 circumstances has to mean something that really makes 5 something exceptional, why is negligence of any variant 6 exceptional? 7 MR. SCHER: Because when you look at, for 8 example, in this particular case, when we are talking 9 about an exceptional circumstance, you're talking 10 about a lot of times -- and courts have done this -11 is the confluence of what the attorney did or didn't do 12 versus what the petitioner did. 13 So we have, of course -- along the lines of 14 the extraordinary circumstances here, we have 15 Petitioner's diligence. And in some respects they 16 dovetail. And I think what the Eleventh Circuit did was 17 say we don't care what the Petitioner did; we don't 18 really care what the lawyer did; anything the lawyer did 19 unless the lawyer was mentally ill or had divided 20 loyalties, then that's -- those are the only factors that 21 were going to be considered in terms of equitable 22 tolling. 23 But that is -- that is antithetical to 24 the very nature of equity. Here -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: We've never held that
10 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 equitable tolling for anything is available under this 2 statute of limitations here. 3 MR. SCHER: That's correct. This Court, 4 however -5 JUSTICE SCALIA: And why should it be? It 6 seems to me, this is not like the ordinary statute of 7 limitations, where it says, you know, the statute is five 8 years, and courts make all sorts of necessary exceptions 9 to the five years. But here you have a statute that -10 that provides exceptions, for example, "the limitation 11 period shall run from the latest of the date on which 12 the impediment to filing an application created by State 13 action in violation ... is removed." In other words, we're 14 going to toll it for that particular event. 15 "The date on which the constitutional right 16 asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme 17 Court" -- we're going to toll it for that. 18 "The date on which the factual predicate of 19 the claim or claims presented could have been discovered 20 through exercise of due diligence." 21 Many of -- many of the equitable tolling 22 holdings involved precisely that. We'll toll it since 23 you couldn't have found out about the violation within 24 the statutory period. 25 But all of these things are handled already

1 in 2244(d). Why should we -- why should we assume the 2 right to create some additional exceptions from the -3 from the 1-year period? 4 MR. SCHER: Well, with all due respect, I 5 don't concur with the premise that those four particular 6 subsections of 2244(d) are exceptions or -- or are 7 tolling provisions. Indeed, this Court in Jimenez said 8 that those four, (a), (b), (c) and (d), are -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many circuits have 10 said that there is equitable tolling? 11 MR. SCHER: Eleven circuits -- all of the 12 circuits, and the only circuit that hasn't held that is 13 the D.C. Circuit where it remains an open question. So 14 all of the circuits that have addressed -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then it's a question of 16 what are exceptional circumstances and whether it has to 17 be something deliberate, which is what the -- as I 18 understand it, the Michigan Court of Appeals said -19 yes, if it was bad faith -- if it was a lie, a 20 deception -21 MR. SCHER: Correct. And, in fact -22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So they're drawing the 23 line between intentional and -- and without intending 24 but just being careless. 25 MR. SCHER: Correct. And, certainly here, I
12 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 think we have what they deemed to be gross negligence, 2 which I think certainly has an element of, let's say, for 3 example, to use the term "recklessness." I mean, we've 4 got six or seven circuits which have addressed this 5 particular issue in terms of this line between mere 6 negligence and -- and something more than that, and those 7 circuits have all -- in the 13 or 14 years since AEDPA 8 has been around, all been able to effectively deal with 9 these particular cases on their particular facts. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: We have a case this 11 afternoon involving an opinion of ours named McNally, 12 which held that there's no such thing as a fraud action 13 for a right to honest services. How many of the courts 14 of appeals had held that there did exist such a right 15 when we held that there didn't in McNally? 16 MR. SCHER: I'm not familiar. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Every single court of 18 appeals that had faced it had held that there was such a 19 right. So the mere fact that you have 11 court of 20 appeals that have found that they have extraordinary 21 power -- judges like to find that they have power -- and 22 that doesn't necessarily make it right. 23 MR. SCHER: Well -- and I -24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, that also 25 assumes that McNally was correctly decided --
13 Alderson Reporting Company

1 (Laughter.) 2 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- and I don't think it was. 3 May I ask you another question -4 MR. SCHER: Yes. 5 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- prompted by Justice 6 Kennedy's question? Have any of the circuits taken a 7 look at the probable merit of the underlying claim in 8 evaluating the issue? 9 MR. SCHER: In this particular case or in 10 another case? 11 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, not in this particular 12 case. But Justice Kennedy says it's equally unjust to 13 the client whether it's negligence or gross negligence, 14 and I'm just asking whether in any of the reviews of this 15 issue, that you are familiar with, have they sometimes 16 looked at the probable merit of the claim, and if there 17 was merit, why, you were more disturbed about attorney 18 negligence, whereas if it's a frivolous claim, they 19 wouldn't be. But do you know if any of them take a look 20 at that at all? 21 MR. SCHER: There are certainly some cases 22 that address the tolling and then, of course, address the 23 merits of the petition. I don't know that there are any 24 that link the two. But, certainly, if you have, for 25 example -- the Respondent has argued that the floodgates
14 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 are just going open, but certainly one of the -- one of 2 the ways that a Federal district court can deal with 3 this and has dealt with this in the past 13 years is to 4 look at the petition. And if the petition raises 5 something that's so palpably meritless, you don't even 6 need to get to anything about whether it's -- just 7 dismiss the petition because, of course, the vast 8 majority of cases that AEDPA addresses in this particular 9 chapter are noncapital cases and are pro se cases. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I looked in the brief to 11 see if there was reference to the merits, underlying 12 merits of the case. Can you just tell me very quickly 13 what the key arguments are, if we ever reach the merits? 14 MR. SCHER: In the Petitioner's case? 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. 16 MR. SCHER: He had -- well, there were a 17 number of issues that he raised on direct appeal. There 18 was issues regarding counsel. For example, I know in 19 the postconviction motion, one of the key issues was he 20 had a what's termed in Florida "a Nixon issue," which is 21 where counsel conceded some of the elements of the 22 crime. 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I shouldn't probably 24 take your time with that. I will look at the State 25 record.

1 MR. SCHER: But -- but -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Scher, one point that 3 you didn't mention, but you did I thought stress it in 4 your brief, was that counsel here said: Oh, the 5 deadline had run even before I was engaged, even before 6 I was appointed to represent this man, so there was 7 nothing that I could do for him, because the time had 8 already expired. 9 MR. SCHER: That's correct, 10 Justice Ginsburg. What happened is that that particular 11 explanation came up after the fact. I think what's 12 significant about that, number one, is that his 13 explanations have been a moving target to a large 14 extent. But what's even more important is that none of 15 that information was ever imparted to Mr. Holland while 16 the case was pending. 17 While Mr. Collins was providing assurances 18 and reassurances to Mr. Holland -- about, don't 19 worry, your State postconviction motion will be filed 20 on time, your Federal rights will be honored, everything 21 will be done, your appeal will be taken, once we are 22 done in the Florida Supreme Court we will go off to the 23 Federal district court -- at no time did Mr. Collins ever 24 say: We've got a big problem here; the statute may have 25 run, and so we need to start thinking in advance of ways
16 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to deal with this. 2 For example, if Mr. Collins truly 3 believed that the statute had already run, the day the 4 Florida Supreme Court issued that decision, he should 5 have been in Federal court filing something right away. 6 JUSTICE ALITO: Could you just tell me in a 7 sentence or two what test you think we should apply for 8 equitable tolling? What is necessary in order for there 9 to be equitable tolling? 10 MR. SCHER: Your Honor, I think the -- the 11 test is the test that this Court has applied, which is 12 in Pace and in Lawrence, which is extraordinary 13 circumstances coupled with diligence. I think under 14 those particular -- coupled with diligence, the 15 Petitioner's diligence. 16 JUSTICE ALITO: What does "extraordinary 17 circumstances" mean? 18 MR. SCHER: It's -- it's a case-by-case type of 19 issue. It's because it's an equitable remedy. It's not 20 something that's susceptible to rigid rules, which of 21 course is the problem with the Eleventh Circuit's 22 categorical exclusion of a particular large chunk of 23 misconduct on the part of the attorney. But certainly 24 here, where we have extraordinary circumstances, we have 25 lack of notice to the Petitioner that his State court
17 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 opinion had been issued, that they had affirmed, that 2 the mandate had come out; and a failure to communicate, 3 wholesale failure to communicate, bordering on, in fact, 4 abandonment -5 JUSTICE SCALIA: All of that has nothing to 6 do with -- with what caused -- what caused the inability 7 to -- to bring the habeas action. 8 MR. SCHER: Well -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: All of that is -- is 10 preliminary to that. This may have been a very 11 irresponsible lawyer, but that has nothing to do with 12 the event that -- the simple event, failure to file in 13 that what, 30-day period, which -14 MR. SCHER: Fourteen days. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Fourteen days. It seems to 16 me "extraordinary" means unusual. So you say any unusual 17 event is a possible? 18 MR. SCHER: Well, I think the one -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Any unusual event is a 20 possible for a court to say, oh, yes, it says a year, 21 but this is unusual so we will give you a year and a 22 half. 23 MR. SCHER: Well, I think what we have here 24 is what makes this case I think unusual, and it's the 25 first type of case that this Court has seen, is under
18 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 these circumstances you have this confluence of events. 2 And I think what makes this case -- what sets this case 3 apart from the other ones that this Court has seen and 4 that certainly other courts have seen is, for example, 5 it's extraordinary -- or it was diligent for Mr. Holland 6 to have asked the Florida Supreme Court on two occasions 7 to rid himself of Collins, and he asked to proceed pro se. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The client -- this client 9 was sort of the pesky client, but apparently knew a lot 10 more about AEDPA than most people generally do. I mean, 11 AEDPA's not exactly an ordinary term. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: And had a lot of time to 13 devote to it. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and suppose you have a 15 client who is just bewildered. He doesn't know AEDPA; 16 he doesn't know Federal court. Why should he be in any 17 worse position than this client? 18 MR. SCHER: Well -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me it would be 20 the other way around. This fellow knew enough that, if 21 he had really just done a little bit more, he would have 22 -- well, he tried to file a petition, but he might have 23 done a little bit more. 24 MR. SCHER: Well, I think -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the uninformed client,
19 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the ignorant client, could never have approached this. 2 I don't know why he shouldn't be more protected than 3 your client, which goes back to Justice Alito's question. 4 I'm not sure how we draw this line. 5 MR. SCHER: I think the problem we have here 6 with Mr. Holland is that the more diligent he was, the 7 more the Respondent and the lower courts have said he 8 should have done. And so he did X, Y, and Z; they say 9 you should have done A, B, and C. 10 But what I think is -- is significant here 11 is he was stuck with this lawyer. He tried to get rid of 12 the lawyer. The State filed motions saying you can't -13 not only can you not fire him, you can't file a pro se 14 motion because you are represented by the lawyer. So all 15 Mr. Holland hears from the courts is that: You can't speak 16 to us and we can't speak to you. So he's stuck. 17 And then, of course, he's writing to the 18 Florida Supreme Court clerk begging for information, and 19 in fact in footnote 11 of the brief -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he never asked -- he 21 wrote to the clerk, but he never asked to be informed 22 when the judgment came down. 23 MR. SCHER: Well, what we have, Your Honor, 24 is if you look on page 11, in footnote 11, Mr. Holland 25 wrote a letter to the Florida Supreme Court clerk,
20 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 toward the end of which he says: "I'm not trying to get 2 on your nerves. I would just like to know exactly what 3 is happening with my case on appeal to the Supreme Court 4 of Florida." 5 So we certainly have in the clerk's office 6 -- and, again, that was on page 11, footnote 11. It's 7 also at the Joint Appendix at 146 to 147. 8 What we have here is Petitioner putting the 9 Florida Supreme Court on explicit notice that he is 10 having a problem with his lawyer, and further -- earlier 11 in that particular letter, he apologizes to the clerk, 12 saying: I'm sorry to pester you with these -- with these 13 requests, but if I had a lawyer who was responding to my 14 letters and who was listening to me and who would send 15 me the documentations, I wouldn't have to be bothering 16 you, but this is the situation that I'm in. 17 And then, of course, he tries to not only have 18 Mr. Collins substituted, but he asks to go pro se. 19 That's an extraordinary circumstance. And what makes it 20 even further, more extraordinary is the State coming in 21 and saying, no, you can't not only do that, but you are 22 not even allowed to file the paperwork asking to do 23 that. And, in fact, when Mr. Holland did file his pro se 24 petition in Federal district court, the State moved to 25 strike it because he was represented by -- by counsel.

1 And so -2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this case 3 different if the filing error -- I understand there was 4 a lot going on, but if the lawyer just miscalculated the 5 days and was off by one day, this case comes out the 6 other way in your view, right? 7 MR. SCHER: I think not only under my -- I 8 think, certainly, courts have -- have discussed this, that 9 that's -- that's just an unfortunate mere mistake. But I 10 think certainly we don't have that under the facts of 11 this case. There has never been any suggestion that 12 there was any miscalculation. We just have 13 complete abandonment by -- by the -14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't -- you say -15 you say "complete abandonment." But this lawyer filed a 16 whole lot of things on behalf of this client. He missed 17 a very critical thing, the Federal habeas filing. But 18 it's not abandonment of a client in the sense of not 19 doing anything for the client. 20 So it goes back to my beginning question, 21 which is, where is the line drawn between the types of 22 negligence and what the circuit suggested, which is some 23 sort of intentional malfeasance? 24 MR. SCHER: And I didn't mean to suggest -25 when I -- when I used the word "abandonment," I'm -- I'm
22 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 referring to, of course, in terms of abandonment with 2 regard to preserving -- enforcing the assurances that 3 Collins had made with respect to filing the petition. 4 And, of course, he also had told -- that -5 Mr. Holland that he would inform him of the Florida 6 Supreme Court's decision, because that, of course, is 7 the triggering date. 8 We have Mr. Holland, who had already been -9 you know, asked his lawyer, you know, please file 10 certain issues in my case and please keep me informed. 11 When those two promises and assurances were not kept by 12 the lawyer, Mr. Holland at that point has reason to be 13 concerned that the additional promise, which is, I will 14 file on time, was not going to be honored. 15 And so Mr. Holland embarked on a series of 16 diligent steps in order to get some information, but he 17 didn't know where to turn. And, then, of course, for 18 example, he writes to the clerk's office of the supreme 19 court. Sometimes they send him information; sometimes 20 they tell him to send a check. 21 He doesn't know. He is not getting any 22 consistency, and he's certainly not getting any response 23 from his attorney. 24 Then he files these motions in the State 25 supreme court, which are opposed by the State as
23 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 nullities because he is represented by counsel. He then 2 writes to the Florida Supreme Court saying, can you give 3 me the information about your Web site -- maybe I can have 4 some friends look up this case. Because, of course, he 5 knows at this point that there is a problem, and he 6 knows that the triggering date for the filing in the 7 Federal petition is the denial by the Florida Supreme 8 Court and the issuance of the mandate. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you are -- you 10 seem, from what you just said, to be relying on a 11 distinction between paid counsel, who is just as 12 careless, and court-appointed counsel, because in the 13 one case the client had picked that attorney, and in the 14 other case, the client was given this attorney by the 15 State. So I think you're suggesting that the State has 16 some responsibility when it provides the counsel. 17 But before you said, no, your answer would 18 be the same if you were not making a distinction between 19 court-appointed and paid counsel. 20 MR. SCHER: I think the -- the distinction 21 that I was making -- I'm not saying that there's a 22 difference in terms of paid or appointed counsel, but 23 here where you have appointed counsel, I think one of 24 the extraordinary factors is the State coming in and -25 and moving to strike these pro se pleadings, telling

1 Mr. -- sending a signal to Mr. Holland that you are 2 stuck with Collins, you can't speak to the supreme 3 court, and the supreme court can't speak to you. 4 Everything has to be funneled through your lawyer. 5 And, of course, the ironic thing is that, had 6 Mr. Holland been permitted to proceed pro se, he would 7 have gotten copied with the decision by the supreme 8 court of Florida. He would have gotten copied with the 9 mandate. And then he would have known when the mandate 10 issued. 11 And as we know, when he found out -- I mean, 12 the other extraordinary factor here is that when he 13 found out that this happened, he prepared that petition 14 that day and mailed it the next day. This is not 15 somebody who sat on his rights. He didn't start 16 complaining and writing letters and bemoaning his 17 situation. He took action, which also distinguishes 18 this case from a number of others. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I understand 20 what the cases have said. I -- I have trouble 21 understanding why that should make a difference, why 22 that should be so pertinent, why he should be in better 23 shape than somebody who says: Look, I don't know 24 anything about this. I need a good lawyer. This is what 25 I get. I'm trusting you. Tell me what I should do, and I

1 leave it in your hands. 2 And that person is in somehow worse shape? 3 MR. SCHER: Well, because in Lawrence and in -4 in Coleman this Court had -- had said that that made a 5 difference. In Lawrence, this Court had said Lawrence 6 was out of luck because it's not like he asked for 7 another lawyer or asked to proceed pro se. And so 8 Holland -- and so Lawrence was stuck. 9 I would respectfully reserve the remainder 10 of my time. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 12 Mr. Makar. 13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT D. MAKAR 14 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 15 MR. MAKAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 16 please the Court: 17 This case, we believe, is decided by one 18 principle -19 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask just an 20 information question before you -- are the postconviction 21 lawyers in these cases that are appointed, are they 22 compensated by the State? 23 MR. MAKAR: Yes, they are. 24 JUSTICE STEVENS: They are. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And also, just in the

1 course of your argument, how -- how often do these 2 deadlines missed (a) in capital cases and (b) in AEDPA 3 cases? Do you have any statistics on that, or can you 4 tell us from your experience? 5 MR. MAKAR: I can tell you anecdotally the 6 attorneys that handle these cases in Florida, that the 7 equitable tolling issue comes up with some regularity. 8 I'm aware of three cases just in Jacksonville where I 9 live where the district judge there has had evidentiary 10 hearings and has looked at these equitable tolling issues. 11 In Florida, we have 394 individuals on death 12 row, and those cases are at various stages in the 13 litigation. So there is a certain amount of that that 14 goes on. 15 As to the noncapital cases, we know that 16 the system is flooded with habeas petitions. Obviously, 17 most of those are unrepresented. But there still is, in 18 those cases -- a study I saw recently, a 2007 study from 19 Vanderbilt University, that about 20 percent of those 20 cases are dismissed on statute of limitations grounds. 21 I'm inferring from that that there is some equitable 22 tolling action going on there, but the specific amount 23 we're not sure of. But certainly in both the capital 24 and noncapital area, this is an issue. 25 And if I could get to the standard here,

We -4 JUSTICE BREYER: You mean to imply that 5 earthquake, fire, flood, mad postman burns mail truck, 6 et cetera? 7 MR. MAKAR: Precisely, Your Honor. I 8 mean -9 JUSTICE BREYER: So, even if it's a terrible 10 earthquake, all these people are just out of luck? 11 MR. MAKAR: Well -- well, there are some, 12 certainly, safety valves if there's a natural disaster, 13 some -14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why? Natural 15 disaster, yes, you said no equitable tolling, they're 16 out of luck? 17 MR. MAKAR: Well -- well, for example, the 18 Rules of Federal Procedure were recently amended to 19 allow for late filing when the courthouse is inaccessible. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: The statute? 21 MR. MAKAR: Precisely, Your Honor. And we 22 think -23 JUSTICE BREYER: And, so, are you -- you 24 read the statute to say in some cases, you could do it. 25 If you're going to read it in some cases you can do it,
28 Alderson Reporting Company

1 then I guess we're at a discussion of is this one of 2 those cases? 3 MR. MAKAR: Well, two responses. Number 4 one, we do not believe that equitable tolling was 5 intended by Congress under this complex statute of 6 limitations for all the reasons set out in our brief. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: So that's earthquake, 8 fire, flood, et cetera? 9 MR. MAKAR: Exactly. And it relates to the 10 same result, it seems -- to the same result as this Court 11 came to in Beggerly and Brockamp, where the -- if 12 Congress intended that to be the case, that's the case. 13 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the lawyer lies to 14 the client and the client says my time is running out, 15 have you filed my -- my Federal habeas petition, and the 16 lawyer says, yes, I filed it and here it is, and it has 17 a -- a forged date stamp on it? No equitable tolling 18 there? 19 MR. MAKAR: Well, under our position that 20 Congress intended to draw a very clear line, no. If 21 the -- if the Court assumes or decides there is some 22 sort of equitable tolling, then that's a different case, 23 and -- and in those situations where there's something 24 beyond the incompetence of the lawyer. And that's our rule. 25 If the Court decides there is equitable tolling or
29 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 assumes it exists, it has to be that the rule that the 2 incompetence of the postconviction counsel cannot be a 3 basis for relief. 4 That's what this Court has essentially said 5 in Lawrence and also in Coleman, and also what Congress 6 inferentially said in -- in 2254(i). 7 So, under those circumstances, here our rule 8 works because you don't get into those gradations of 9 negligence, you know, is it gross negligence? Well, 10 how gross? And the bottom line here in this particular case, 11 of course -- and the Court has asked these questions 12 here -- is what really happened in this case? All you 13 had was a Lawrence error, which was -14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why should it matter? 15 It's certainly unusual. Isn't that what we are after, one, 16 is he diligent? Answer, yes, he has been diligent. 17 Two, is it extraordinary? I would think it 18 was fairly extraordinary that a person writes these letters 19 to counsel and so forth, then the -- the thing isn't 20 filed. Is that extraordinary or not? 21 Whether it was his fault, whether he himself 22 was kidnapped. I mean, maybe it wasn't the counsel's 23 fault. You can imagine a lot of circumstances. But the 24 question, I would think, is, is it extraordinary and is 25 it fair?

This is common -3 JUSTICE BREYER: You mean counsel in Florida 4 often when -- miss deadlines and so forth when their 5 counsel -- when their client specifically says to them, 6 even a few weeks before and by mail several times, 7 please file such-and-such, is not extraordinary in 8 Florida? 9 MR. MAKAR: It's not just Florida; it's 10 nationwide there's -- there's problem with this complex 11 statute of limitations -12 JUSTICE BREYER: We have a problem with 13 the bar, don't we, if -- if -- if the -- if -14 (Laughter.) 15 MR.

The only -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I -- I didn't hear. 20 You say there has been discipline or there -21 MR.

1 authority to do this, would it make sense to say 2 that the State is going to be subject to equitable 3 tolling on a rather broad standard -- we're going to 4 give equitable tolling often -- unless the State has 5 attorney discipline procedures, so that this happens 6 only once and then the attorney can no longer practice 7 in the Federal courts? 8 MR. MAKAR: I suppose as a matter of -9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Obviously, what we're 10 looking for is some sort of a rule to keep the deadline, 11 and if we're going to accommodate your friend on the 12 other side, to have -- to have some rule about 13 exceptional -- exceptional cases. 14 MR. MAKAR: Well, perhaps something along 15 those lines legislatively might be -- be considered, but 16 -- but in the end, what we have here is garden-variety 17 attorney negligence miscalculating and missing a 18 deadline. The -19 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there at least one 20 additional thing here? Holland filed a request -- a pro 21 se request to be relieved of Collins's representation, 22 and that was rejected by the -- that was rejected by the 23 court because he was pro se. And therefore he couldn't 24 ask -- he couldn't file something himself? 25 MR. MAKAR: Well, let me clarify that,
32 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 because there's a misconception going on here. In the 2 Florida Supreme Court postconviction process, Collins 3 -- I'm sorry, Holland twice filed motions to remove 4 Collins. Importantly, Holland never asked to go pro se. 5 That is incorrect. If you look at Joint Appendix 134 6 and 149 -- those are the two pro se filings that Holland 7 made here. In both of those, he said: I'm having a 8 conflict with my lawyer. My lawyer won't do what I want 9 him to do; I want a new lawyer. 10 And that's all he said: I want a new lawyer. 11 He never -12 JUSTICE ALITO: Was that denied on the 13 ground that he was pro se? 14 MR. MAKAR: The first motion was stricken. 15 It was then denied because he was represented by counsel 16 at that point. Keep in mind, this is in the State 17 postconviction process. This is not where the Federal 18 AEDPA deadline and so forth is being kicked about. In 19 fact, there is really no discussion whatsoever about 20 what the actual deadline to file this petition was at 21 all in the record. 22 The only time Holland asked to go pro se in 23 any court filing is after he filed the pro se petition 24 in Federal court -- the untimely one. He then shortly 25 thereafter filed an emergency motion to relieve Collins,
33 Alderson Reporting Company

1 and -2 JUSTICE ALITO: What I don't understand is, 3 how can a -- how can a client request to have -- to be 4 relieved of representation, if the client can't file 5 that motion pro se? I understand the other things, but 6 I don't understand why -- how -- how you can deny the 7 request to get rid of this lawyer? Unless he has to 8 have the lawyer file the motion for him? 9 (Laughter.) 10 MR. MAKAR: No, I think that certainly the 11 filing of the motion, I think perhaps it was -- it shouldn't 12 have been stricken the first time, but the court then on the 13 merits denied it the second time. And keep in mind -- I 14 forget who alluded to it -- this has been somewhat of an 15 unusual case from the outset, in that if you look at the 16 three Florida Supreme Court opinions that have been 17 issued in this case, it shows that at the first trial 18 Holland absented himself from the -- absented himself 19 from the trial and he had to watch on circuit -20 closed-circuit TV because he was being very difficult. 21 And then in the second trial, we had two 22 Faretta hearings amounting to hundreds of pages in which 23 the Florida Supreme Court then said, well, he wants to 24 represent himself, but he can't conduct himself properly 25 and so forth. And also there's the issue of his -- his
34 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 -- there's a mental issue there as well, that he has 2 raised on appeal as well. 3 So the court -- the Florida courts are sort 4 of put in this difficult posture of saying, we want you 5 to have counsel, we need you to have counsel because we 6 want you to have effective representation, but then 7 throughout the process here it's been a difficult, 8 difficult number of decades, essentially, in this 9 situation. So I think it's an unfair characterization 10 to say that the Florida courts and also the Office of 11 Attorney General who -- who routinely moves to 12 strike these -- it's not because we're trying to deny 13 anyone's day in court. It's because you have a lawyer 14 and they have to speak to the lawyer, and the hybrid 15 representation is impermissible. So -16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we go back to 17 just -18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The State -- the State 19 has no responsibility even though it made this 20 appointment? So you agree there's no difference, 21 whether it was paid counsel, somebody that the -- that 22 the defendant picked to represent him, and someone that 23 he just had to take because it's what the State gave him? 24 MR. MAKAR: Exactly. And -- and that's the 25 way the Court's decision in Coleman has allocated the
35 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 burdens and the risks. I mean, what the Court said was 2 okay, if it's a direct appeal where the State is charged 3 with that responsibility, that's one thing; but when 4 it's postconviction, it's shifted. The whole paradigm 5 and whole structure is flipped the other way, and you, 6 the Petitioner, bear the burden, and not the State. 7 This is important under AEDPA, because AEDPA -8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Under -- on direct appeal, 9 if counsel conducted himself this way, the State 10 would -- he'd have to get relief because the State 11 would have the burden, but not -- not on collateral? 12 Is that what you're saying? 13 MR. MAKAR: Sure. On direct appeal, if the 14 lawyer is deemed to be ineffective, then that would be a 15 constitutional error, and that would be subject to some 16 sort of relief, but it flips in the postconviction 17 stage, as this Court has held in Coleman. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I'm 19 concerned about some of the situations Justice Breyer 20 mentions, you know, if there is an earthquake, a plane 21 crash, but the law seems to be focusing on other things 22 when it's talking about extraordinary circumstances. 23 Like here, we're talking about how diligent he was in 24 pursuing his lawyer. There seems to be a disconnect 25 there.

1 I don't know why -- I mean, assuming we're 2 going to have, for argument, equitable tolling, what 3 should we be looking at? The unusual nature of the 4 situation that comes up, or whether you've got a pesky 5 client? 6 MR. MAKAR: Well, I think two responses 7 there: Obviously, we believe that attorney incompetence 8 or so forth cannot be a basis for equitable tolling. 9 These other situations about natural disasters and 10 hypotheticals where some, you know, very unusual, bizarre 11 situation comes in that's external to the 12 attorney-client relationship, perhaps those -- those 13 could be considered. 14 But we believe that the Congress, through its 15 purpose in enacting this statute of limitations, a 16 complex one that has exceptions, that -- that is 17 designed to alleviate the burdens and delays -- its intent 18 was not to allow equitable tolling, because we -19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it 20 legislated against the background of cases like Irwin 21 that stated the general proposition is, unless Congress 22 says otherwise, there is equitable tolling. 23 MR. MAKAR: But that can be rebutted. That 24 can be rebutted, and we believe has been rebutted by the 25 record here, which shows that these are precisely the

1 kind of delays that Congress intended to avoid by having 2 a strict 1-year statute of limitations, that there's 3 burdens put on -- not just the States but the courts -4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- what I worry about 5 is that you're confusing the -- or perceive -6 confusing the fact that lawyer negligence may not be the 7 type of situation that Congress was looking at. With 8 the hypotheticals that Justice Breyer listed, which are 9 a different kind of situation, and you are trying to 10 pigeonhole both and say Congress didn't intend for both 11 to be covered. And yet you suggested a little later 12 that they may have intended what Justice Breyer was 13 thinking about. I -- I don't see anything in the 14 structure of the statute that would preclude what 15 Justice Breyer listed. 16 MR. MAKAR: Well -17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what can we read to 18 suggest that -- forget about the lawyer malfeasance; 19 let's talk just about equitable tolling 20 MR. MAKAR: Sure. Well -21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in its traditional 22 sense. Most of the cases in equitable tolling, by the way, 23 have to do with court errors. 24 MR. MAKAR: Sure. What we're suggesting is 25 that under the structure of the Brockamp decision, what
38 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the Court looked at there to determine when there is no 2 equitable tolling intended by Congress, that here 3 likewise there is no equitable tolling, and as the Court 4 held in Brockamp, the fact that there may be unfairness 5 in individual cases was the price Congress was willing 6 to pay, the tradeoff it was willing to allow, to have a 7 habeas system that was functioning. 8 Now, assuming that position is rejected by 9 the Court or the Court assumes equitable tolling, the 10 next question is what should be allowed. And we believe 11 it has to be exceptionally narrow. And certainly in 12 this case -- and this case is all about attorney 13 negligence or attorney gross negligence -- those -14 those sort of circumstances are not enough. And -15 JUSTICE BREYER: Why could you not say 16 here -- I mean, the key sentence, I take it, is the 17 Eleventh Circuit and it says: "No allegation of lawyer 18 negligence or failure to meet the standard of care" -19 none -- without "proof, bad faith, dishonesty, mental 20 impairment" on the part of the lawyer, could ever 21 qualify. 22 Now, that's -- so we just say, no, no, that 23 isn't so. Sometimes it could, when combined with other 24 circumstances. And then go back and let them -- I don't 25 know what this particular individual Petitioner's prior
39 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 conduct has been. I understand the problems that you 2 have. But do you -- I guess you're going to say no to 3 this, but -- but it's a little hard to see why you couldn't 4 have a narrow standard but just not rule out the 5 possibility that under certain circumstances, just 6 negligence or even less -- maybe the lawyer wasn't even 7 at fault; maybe he got kidnapped. You know, I mean, there 8 are odd things that happen in life. And just say go look for 9 this; see if it's truly extraordinary, if it's fair, if 10 he was diligent. What about that? 11 MR. MAKAR: Well, we agree with the Eleventh 12 Circuit standard to the extent it says, you know, that this 13 sort of attorney negligence, gross negligence, incompetence, 14 is not enough. Where we differ from the Eleventh Circuit 15 is we're concerned, based upon our pragmatic day-in, 16 day-out handling of these cases, that when you say 17 dishonesty, well -- or a conflict -- that those concepts 18 can be conflated into things that they are not, 19 particularly when these communications between lawyer 20 and client are outside the State's view. We are not 21 privy to what goes on between lawyer and client. The 22 lawyer says, I will do this, says it verbally or maybe 23 even in writing. We don't know about that. We're not 24 privy to all that. 25 And it creates this potential, when we allow
40 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the standard, as the Eleventh Circuit held -- we allow the 2 standard to gravitate away from its core purpose and 3 allows it to be used to sort of game the system in a way 4 to gain an advantage. That's why we are concerned about 5 any degree of attorney misconduct or behavior because it 6 could easily -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any idea, 8 before the Eleventh Circuit announced its standard, how 9 many habeas petitions were tolled by district courts in 10 that -- in your -- in Florida, on the basis of equitable 11 tolling, that -- that they permitted petitions to go 12 forward after the statute of limitations? 13 MR. MAKAR: Unfortunately, I'm not aware of 14 any data on that. There are not that many. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: So would there be -- I 16 mean, what I'm actually worried about is not a lawyer 17 being kidnapped. I'm actually worried what can 18 happen in a person's life. He gets deathly ill. His wife 19 gets sick. Something happens to the children. Some very 20 unusual thing comes along at the last minute, and all the 21 plans go awry. And to have a little bit of flexibility 22 in this statute to take care of those very unusual human 23 circumstances seems a reasonable reading of it. But you 24 say it's not because -25 MR. MAKAR: Well, we say it's not because
41 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Congress intended not to have equitable tolling, and 2 then to the extent it did, it could have drafted 3 something along the lines of what's in 2263, which is 4 the next chapter -- it's the companion chapter that says 5 instead of having 365 days with no equitable tolling, 6 you can have 180 days and 30 days for good cause if 7 there's a deadline missed -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not -- you're 9 not worried about Justice Breyer's case of the really 10 extraordinary circumstance where everybody would say, 11 well, that's -- you know, we understand. You're 12 worried that if you create an exception, that all sorts 13 of other stuff will come in. And so why isn't the answer 14 to that concern that you've got an unusual case here 15 where you do have the client saying, do this, do this, 16 do this, and the lawyer doesn't? 17 MR. MAKAR: Well, under these facts -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's very hard to 19 argue against -- against equity, against equitable 20 tolling. But at the same time, I think you do need a 21 constraining principle that it doesn't do away with the 22 statute of limitations. So why isn't what we have here 23 good enough? 24 MR. MAKAR: Meaning the Eleventh Circuit's 25 standard?
42 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Meaning the fact 2 that you have got a client who is constantly telling the 3 lawyer, do this, you know, get it done; doesn't get the 4 judgment. And, you know, it's not just your run-of-the-mill 5 case where the lawyer happens to miss a deadline. 6 MR. MAKAR: Well, that goes to the issue 7 that -- of not -- of diligence, of course, which is not 8 the issue we're looking at. We're looking at the 9 extraordinary circumstances, not the diligence. 10 Extraordinary circumstance has to be something that -11 attributable to the lawyer or something along those lines. 12 We're not -- we'll concede diligence for the 13 moment and say here it's what the lawyer did, as 14 Lawrence held. He missed the deadline. In fact, 15 this case -- you know, Lawrence, obviously -- it was 364 16 days before they even filed the State postconviction motion, 17 and the lawyer in that case wasn't appointed for 300 days, 18 and the State postconvictions process was sort of in 19 disarray. And all those things that the Court in 20 Lawrence said are not supportable for equitable tolling 21 apply equally here. 22 The only difference in this case is this 23 allegation about the -- the lawyer didn't communicate 24 with his client. Well, if that becomes the governing rule, 25 all is lost, because attorney communication with client
43 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 is perhaps even more amorphous a concept. It could be 2 based on verbal representations and so forth. So we are 3 very concerned that it not slip into that sphere where 4 it can be easily manipulated for the advantage of 5 getting some sort of delay. 6 And as I say, the analysis here of 7 purpose of AEDPA, structure of AEDPA, and the 8 burdens -- as I say, the burdens are important to the 9 State and to the court system. I was looking at that 10 recent study, the 2007 study, that seemed to suggest 11 that AEDPA is -- basically, when these cases are being 12 filed in Federal district court, it has taken a year and 13 a half to 2, 3 years for them to be resolved, and in 14 this case keep in mind it took 18 months in the district 15 court, 18 months in the Eleventh Circuit, and then 16 further. 17 But that's allowing the invocation of this 18 doctrine, not just in this case. We're worried about the 19 noncapital context as well, that that will somehow put 20 an end to the importance of what Congress enacted. 21 There is a pre-AEDPA mentality out there, 22 I'm afraid. And it's natural. It's understandable. 23 We're all human. There's a pre-AEDPA mentality that 24 there must be a remedy. There must be some equity done. 25 And I think that sort of undergirds why perhaps most of
44 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the circuits have either assumed -- I think 11 have 2 either assumed or adopted some sort of equitable 3 tolling. 4 I think they are waiting for this Court, 5 which has left the question open to provide guidance on 6 that issue, and we suggest that either there be no 7 equitable tolling or that, if there is to be equitable 8 tolling, on the circumstances of this case it has to be 9 extreme attorney misconduct or incompetence, and that 10 just simply is not established on this record. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- why isn't it 12 extreme attorney incompetence to miss a deadline? I 13 mean, you either miss it or you don't. It's not going 14 to get -- why doesn't that qualify as extreme attorney 15 misconduct? 16 MR. MAKAR: Well, I guess the short answer, 17 of course, is the courts have said no, that's not 18 enough, we need something that's truly extreme, 19 something far from just missing a deadline. We probably 20 all know lawyers who have missed deadlines. We all know 21 lawyers who haven't communicated with their clients. 22 Those things are ordinary, run-of-the-mill, happen-every-day 23 sort of events. It has to be something beyond that. 24 It has to be something that is truly extreme for 25 the exception to kick in.

I mean, oh gosh, that 10 strikes us all as just -- that's -11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we don't -12 that's not negligence. 13 MR.

MAKAR: It has to be something beyond 19 just attorney incompetence. What the -- that's a 20 concept that we can get our arms around, and we 21 certainly get into this line-drawing of, well, is a 22 failure to communicate three or four times enough? Or a 23 failure to have a letter go to the client in response to 24 his request -- is that enough? 25 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask another
46 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 question? It doesn't go to the merits, but I'm really 2 curious. The lawyers selected for postconviction work, 3 which I understand now are compensated by the State, are 4 they selected from the same panels as the lawyers that 5 represent defendants generally and who are appointed by 6 the State in criminal matters? 7 MR. MAKAR: Well, there's a collateral counsel 8 registry list. 9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is it -10 MR. MAKAR: There's actually what they call 11 CCRC. There's actually State lawyers around the State who 12 provide this, and then there's a registry list as well. 13 And they have to meet certain standards. Chapter 27 of 14 our Florida Statutes set out the standards that these 15 counsel have to meet. 16 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the collateral counsel 17 registry is a different group of lawyers than are 18 generally appointed in criminal cases? 19 MR. MAKAR: Yes. 20 JUSTICE STEVENS: I see. 21 MR. MAKAR: Well, Your Honors, if there's 22 no further questions, we ask that the court affirm the 23 Eleventh Circuit below, either on the basis that there's 24 no equitable tolling or that on this record there's 25 no basis for it under the attorney incompetence

1 standard. 2 Thank you. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 4 Mr. Scher, you have 4 minutes remaining. 5 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TODD G. SCHER 6 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 7 MR. SCHER: I just have a couple of brief 8 points. First, to clarify, the Respondent argued that 9 Mr. Holland never asked to proceed pro se in the State 10 court, and that's just incorrect, and it's flatly 11 contradicted by their brief on page 43, where they 12 write: "Holland moved to replace Collins with another 13 attorney (whom Holland presumably thought would raise 14 any issues Holland desired) or to proceed pro se if 15 substitute counsel could not be appointed." 16 And I think, again, going back to one of 17 the things that Justice Breyer was discussing with 18 Respondent's counsel, was I think that that -- the 19 problem with the Eleventh Circuit's analysis is this 20 categorical exclusion. Equitable tolling and 21 extraordinary circumstances have to be considered as 22 a -- consider all the circumstances, and so to 23 categorically exclude this one particular area, 24 we submit, is what the problem is here. 25 And we also do have, contrary to what

1 the Respondent contended -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you would say -3 it is -- you could categorically excuse ordinary 4 negligence as opposed to gross negligence? 5 MR. SCHER: That's where courts, including 6 this Court, have drawn the line. That seems to be the 7 floor, but, you know, obviously, when you get into the 8 particular circumstances of a case, that's where a 9 categorical rule excluding a particular type of area 10 beyond just garden-variety neglect -- really, that's 11 the problem here, is that was antithetical to the 12 notion of equity. 13 And I just wanted to point out briefly that 14 this record does avail itself of numerous instances where 15 Mr. Holland had alleged that the attorney lied to him. JA 16 -- in the Joint Appendix on 170, Mr. Holland writes that 17 Mr. Collins lied to him. On the Joint Appendix on 194, 18 that Mr. Collins deceived him and misled him -19 JUSTICE ALITO: What were the lies? 20 MR. SCHER: -- about when the petition was 21 going to be -22 JUSTICE ALITO: What was -- give me an example 23 of a lie that he told him? 24 MR. SCHER: These were in the context of Mr. 25 Collins telling Mr. Holland that he would protect his

1 Federal habeas rights. Those -2 JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't that go without 3 saying, that every attorney -- and every attorney presumably 4 undertakes not to miss the statute of limitations? Is 5 there a difference between the attorney who simply says 6 nothing and the attorney who says, yes, I'm not going to 7 miss the statute of limitations? 8 MR. SCHER: I think it makes it more -9 JUSTICE ALITO: That's a lie? 10 MR. SCHER: I think it makes it makes 11 it more extraordinary. And what makes that situation 12 even yet more extraordinary is where the client has 13 tried to rid himself of this lawyer on a number of 14 occasions or to go pro se, precisely because he has been 15 experiencing these -- these -- lack of trust and other 16 problems in terms of these deceptions from his lawyer, 17 so he was really hamstrung by the time that -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I'm worried -19 MR. SCHER: -- it was too late. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I'm worried about 21 the open-ended nature of what you're asking for, how -22 how would you state the test you would like in the most 23 restrictive terms? 24 MR. SCHER: I think in terms -- I think the 25 test would be appropriate, what Justice Breyer
50 Alderson Reporting Company

1 articulated, which is -2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Hurricane or 3 kidnapping? 4 MR. SCHER: No, no. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, the different 6 one. 7 (Laughter.) 8 MR. SCHER: No, the other test, the other 9 test. We need a hurricane exception in Florida. 10 But in terms of the Eleventh Circuit was 11 incorrect in excluding this particular type of attorney 12 misconduct and negligence because that's antithetical 13 to equity, and so I think -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What type -- the 15 problem comes up when you say "this type of attorney 16 negligence." 17 What is your test? What type of -18 MR. SCHER: I certainly think, given the 19 unique facts here, we have, again, the confluence of 20 circumstances. We have the -21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know your test 22 will mean your client wins. 23 MR. SCHER: Correct. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, I mean, can you 25 articulate it more -- because I'm very concerned that if
51 Alderson Reporting Company

1 you start saying, well, you can forgive an inequitable case, 2 every time a case comes up, you're going to -- there's 3 going to be sympathy for the client. The lawyer goofed. 4 Of course, you don't want to penalize the 5 client, but Congress obviously had something more in 6 mind. 7 MR. SCHER: Well, but certainly -- but the other 8 part of the test for equitable tolling is diligence, and 9 I think, when -- when one looks at the -- at the body of 10 case law that has developed since 1997 on the issue of 11 equitable tolling and AEDPA, the vast majority of these 12 cases are disposed on the fact that the Petitioner is 13 indiligent. 14 Here, of course, the Respondent, if I heard 15 correctly, is now conceding that the Petitioner was 16 diligent. And so there are certainly other ways to avoid 17 even having to get to the question of exceptional 18 circumstances; for example, just looking to the 19 diligence prong. 20 But here, where you have a failure to 21 notify, you have the failure to heed the instructions from 22 a client, you have the client saying you've lied to 23 me, the client telling the State and the Federal courts 24 this lawyer is not my agent anymore, I don't want him, I 25 don't trust him, he has misled me, he has deceived me --

1 all of those factors certainly go to a consideration of 2 whether equitable tolling should be warranted, and the 3 problem here is that the Eleventh Circuit said no, 4 categorically no. 5 Thank you very much. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 7 The case is submitted. 8 (Whereupon, at 11:54 a.m., the case in the 9 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
