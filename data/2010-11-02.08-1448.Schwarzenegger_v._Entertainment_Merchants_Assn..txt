1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 08-1448, 5 Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Association. 6 Mr. Morazzini. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ZACKERY P. MORAZZINI 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. MORAZZINI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 10 it please the Court: 11 The California law at issue today before 12 this Court differs from the New York law at issue in 13 Ginsberg in only one respect: Where New York was 14 concerned with minors' access to harmful sexual material 15 outside the guidance of a parent, California is no less 16 concerned with a minor's access to the deviant level of 17 violence that is presented in a certain category of 18 video games that can be no less harmful to the 19 development of minors. 20 When this Court in Ginsberg crafted a rule 21 of law that permits States to regulate a minor's access 22 to such material outside the presence of a parent, it 23 did so for two fundamental reasons that are equally 24 applicable this morning in this case. 25 First, this rule permits parents' claim to
3

Official
1 authority in their own household to direct the 2 upbringing and the development of their children; and, 3 secondly, this rule promotes the States' independent 4 interest in helping parents protect the well-being of 5 children in those instances when parents cannot be 6 present. 7 So this morning, California asks this Court 8 to adopt a rule of law that permits States to restrict 9 minors' ability to purchase deviant, violent video games 10 that the legislature has determined can be harmful to 11 the development and the upbringing - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's a deviant -- a 13 deviant, violent video game? As opposed to what? A 14 normal violent video game? 15 MR. MORAZZINI: Yes, Your Honor. Deviant 16 would be departing from established norms. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: There are established norms 18 of violence? 19 MR. MORAZZINI: Well, I think if we look 20 back - 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, some of the Grimms' 22 fairy tales are quite grim, to tell you the truth. 23 (Laughter.) 24 MR. MORAZZINI: Agreed, Your Honor. But the 25 level of violence -

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are they okay? Are you 2 going to ban them, too? 3 MR. MORAZZINI: Not at all, Your Honor. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What's the difference? I 5 mean, if you -- if you are supposing a category of 6 violent materials dangerous to children, then how do you 7 cut it off at video games? What about films? What 8 about comic books? Grimms' fairy tales? 9 Why are video games special? Or does your 10 principle extend to all deviant, violent materials in 11 whatever form? 12 MR. MORAZZINI: No, Your Honor. That's why 13 I believe California incorporated the three prongs of 14 the Miller standard. So it's not just deviant violence. 15 It's not just patently offensive violence. It's 16 violence that meets all three of the terms set forth 17 in - 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that misses 19 Justice Ginsburg's question, which was: Why just video 20 games? Why not movies, for example, as well? 21 MR. MORAZZINI: Sure, Your Honor. The 22 California Legislature was presented with substantial 23 evidence that demonstrates that the interactive nature 24 of violent -- of violent video games where the minor or 25 the young adult is the aggressor, is the -- is the
5

1 individual acting out this -- this obscene level of 2 violence, if you will, is especially harmful to minors. 3 It - 4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, do you actually have 5 studies that show that video games are more harmful to 6 minors than movies are? 7 MR. MORAZZINI: Well, in the record, Your 8 Honor, I believe it's the Gentile and Gentile study 9 regarding violent video games as exemplary teachers. 10 The authors there note that video games are not only 11 exemplary teachers of pro-social activities, but also 12 exemplary teachers of aggression, which was the 13 fundamental concern of the California Legislature in 14 enacting this statute. 15 So, while the science is continually 16 developing -- indeed, it appears that studies are being 17 released every month regarding - 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was the - 19 JUSTICE KAGAN: And suppose -- suppose a new 20 study suggested that movies were just as violent. Then, 21 presumably, California could regulate movies just as it 22 could regulate video games. 23 MR. MORAZZINI: Well, Your Honor, there is 24 scientific literature out there regarding the impact of 25 violent media on -- on children. In fact, for decades,
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the President, Congress, the FTC, parenting groups have 2 been uniquely concerned with the level of violent media 3 available to minors that they have ready access to. 4 So - 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know -- is that 6 answering Justice Kagan's question? One of the studies, 7 the Anderson study, says that the effect of violence is 8 the same for a Bugs Bunny episode as it is for a violent 9 video. So can the legislature now, because it has that 10 study, say we can outlaw Bugs Bunny? 11 MR. MORAZZINI: No - 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And there are people who 13 would say that the cartoon has very little social value; 14 it's entertainment but not much else. This is 15 entertainment. 16 I'm not suggesting that I like this video, 17 the one at issue that you provided the five-minute clip 18 about. To me, it's not entertainment, but that's not 19 the point. To some, it may well be. 20 MR. MORAZZINI: Justice Sotomayor, cartoons 21 do not depart from the established norms to -- of a 22 level of violence to which children have been 23 historically exposed to. We believe the level of 24 violence in these video games - 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: That same argument could
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 have been made when movies first came out. They could 2 have said, oh, we've had violence in Grimms' fairy 3 tales, but we've never had it, you know, live on the 4 screen. I mean, every time there's a new technology, 5 you can make that argument. 6 MR. MORAZZINI: Well, Your Honor, I think 7 that's the beauty of incorporating the three prongs of 8 the Miller standard into California's law. This 9 standard is very prophylactic and ensures that only a 10 narrow category of material will be covered, certainly 11 not Grimms' fairy tales. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is this any 13 different than what we said we don't do in the First 14 Amendment field in Stevens, where we said we don't look 15 at a category of speech and decide that some of it has 16 low value. We decide whether a category of speech has a 17 historical tradition of being regulated. Now, other 18 than some State statutes that you point to, some of 19 which are very clearly the same as those that we struck 20 down in Wynn, where's the tradition of regulating 21 violence? 22 MR. MORAZZINI: Your Honor, California 23 submits that when the rights of minors are at issue and 24 not the rights of adults, the standard should be more 25 flexible. The Constitution should recognize that when
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the audience is minors, the same standard should not 2 apply. Therefore, the question should not be whether or 3 not historically violent speech was regulated, but 4 whether or not the Constitution guarantees minors a 5 right - 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you get rid of rap 7 music? Have you heard some of the lyrics of some of the 8 rap music, some of the original violent songs that have 9 been sung about killing people and about other violence 10 directed to them? 11 MR. MORAZZINI: I would agree that it - 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could the State - 13 MR. MORAZZINI: I would agree it's 14 egregious, Justice Sotomayor. However - 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't that obscene 16 in the sense that you're using the word, or deviant? 17 MR. MORAZZINI: Well, I'm not sure initially 18 that it's directly harmful to the development of minors 19 in the way that we know that violent video games can be. 20 We know that violent material, like sexual material, 21 appeals to a base instinct in -- in especially minors. 22 It has -- it can be presented in a manner that - 23 JUSTICE ALITO: When you talk about minors, 24 what -- what are you -- what age group are you talking 25 about? If a video game manufacturer has to decide under
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 your statute how to -- where its game stands, what age 2 of -- of a child should the manufacturer have in mind? 3 A 17-year-old? A 10-year-old? 4 MR. MORAZZINI: Your Honor, I would submit 5 that, just like in the obscenity context for minors, a 6 law similar to the New York law at issue in Ginsberg, 7 though California's law hasn't been construed or 8 applied, I would submit that the jury would be 9 instructed to consider minors as a whole. In California 10 that's under 18 years old. So I believe they would just 11 be instructed minors as a class, not - 12 JUSTICE ALITO: How can they -- how can they 13 do that? Isn't the average person likely to think that 14 what's appropriate for a 17-year-old may not be 15 appropriate for a 10-year-old or an 8-year-old? 16 MR. MORAZZINI: Your Honor, I think juries 17 and judges do this every day in the 18 variable obscenity - 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But California doesn't do 20 that. California has in big letters "18." So it's not 21 -- is it okay for a 7-year-old? Is it okay for a 22 12-year-old? Part of this statute requires labeling 23 these video games in big numbers "18." So it's 18, and 24 California doesn't make any distinctions between 25 17-year-olds and 4-year-olds.

1 MR. MORAZZINI: Justice Ginsburg, and I 2 think rightfully so. I think a jury would be charged 3 with -- with perhaps the standard of what the community 4 believes an average minor. So the manufacturer would 5 consider - 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because the average minor 7 is halfway between 0 and 18, is that 9 years old? 8 (Laughter.) 9 MR. MORAZZINI: Fair point, Justice Scalia. 10 I think a jury could be instructed as to the typical age 11 group of minors that are -- that are playing these 12 games. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: Why wouldn't you, if 14 necessary, simply say that -- that a -- a video game 15 that appeals to the prurient, shameful, or morbid 16 interests of those 18 or under, but let's take 18, and 17 it's not suitable in the community for those 18, and it 18 has no redeeming importance of any kind, no serious 19 literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for 20 those 18, that at least as to those, you can't sell it 21 without -- the parent can buy it, but the child can't 22 buy it. So you can't sell to a 12-year-old something 23 that would be horrible for an 18-year-old. Is that - 24 would you be willing to accept that, if necessary, to 25 make this okay on its face?

1 MR. MORAZZINI: Justice Breyer, absolutely. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Morazzini, could I take 4 you back to Justice Scalia's original question, which 5 was what counts as deviant violence or morbid violence? 6 Because I read your briefs all the way through, and the 7 only thing that I found was -- you said was clearly 8 covered by this statute was Postal 2. But presumably 9 the statute applies to more than one video game. So 10 what else does it apply to? How many video games? What 11 kind of video games? 12 I mean, how would you describe in plain 13 English what -- what morbid violence is, what you have 14 to see in a video game for it to be covered? 15 MR. MORAZZINI: Okay, Justice Kagan, I would 16 go back to the language of the statute, and the statute 17 covers video games where the range of options available 18 to the player includes maiming, killing, dismembering, 19 torturing, sexually assaulting, and those types of 20 violence. So I would look to games where - 21 JUSTICE KAGAN: So anything that has those 22 kinds of violence counts? 23 MR. MORAZZINI: No, and then we would move 24 to the three prongs of the Miller standard, Your Honor. 25 We would look to see what -

1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, so how do we separate 2 violent games that are covered from violent games just 3 as violent that are not covered? 4 MR. MORAZZINI: Well, Your Honor, I think a 5 jury could be instructed with expert testimony, with 6 video clips of game play, and to judge for 7 themselves whether - 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not concerned about the 9 jury judging. I'm concerned about the producer of the 10 games who has to know what he has to do in order to 11 comply with the law. And you're telling me, well, a 12 jury can -- of course, a jury can make up its mind, I'm 13 sure. But a law that has criminal penalties has to be 14 clear. And how is the manufacturer to know whether a 15 particular violent game is covered or not? 16 MR. MORAZZINI: Well, Your Honor, if we 17 look - 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would he convene his own 19 jury and -- and try it before -- you know - 20 (Laughter.) 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I really wouldn't know 22 what to do as a manufacturer. 23 MR. MORAZZINI: Justice Scalia, I'm 24 convinced that the video game industry will know what to 25 do. They rate their video games every day on the basis
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 of violence. They rate them for the intensity of the 2 violence, the amount - 3 JUSTICE KAGAN: So is what's covered here 4 the -- the mature category in the ratings? Is that what 5 this statute covers? Is that what it's meant to cover? 6 MR. MORAZZINI: I believe that some mature 7 rated games would be covered, but not all. 8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Some, but not all. 9 MR. MORAZZINI: But not all. 10 Your Honor, just like with sexual material, 11 we can -- we can trust individual panderers of sexual 12 material to judge whether or not it's a -- it's in - 13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me just make one 14 comment on that point. It seems to me all or at least 15 the great majority of the questions today are designed 16 to probe whether or not this statute is vague. And you 17 say the beauty of the statute is that it utilizes the 18 categories that have been used in the obscenity area and 19 that -- that there's an obvious parallel there. 20 The problem is, is that for generations 21 there has been a societal consensus about sexual 22 material. Sex and violence have both been around a long 23 time, but there's a societal consensus about what's 24 offensive for sexual material, and there are judicial 25 discussions on it. Now, those judicial discussions are
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 not precise. You could have had the same questions 2 today with reference to an obscenity statute, and we 3 have -- we have said that with reference to obscenity, 4 there are certain -- that there are certain materials 5 that are not protected. Those rules are not precise at 6 the margins, and some would say not precise in a more 7 significant degree as well. 8 But you're asking us to go into an entirely 9 new area where there are no consensus, no judicial 10 opinions. And this is -- and this indicates to me the 11 statute might be vague, and I just thought you'd like to 12 know that -- that reaction. 13 (Laughter.) 14 MR. MORAZZINI: Justice Kennedy, as with 15 sexual -- the regulation of sexual material and 16 obscenity, we had to start somewhere. California is 17 choosing to start now. We can build a consensus as to 18 what level of violence is in fact patently offensive for 19 minors, is deviant for minors, just as the case law has 20 developed over time with sexual depictions. Your Honor, 21 I believe the key is the -- the similarities violence 22 has with sex. This is material - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about excessive 24 glorification of drinking, movies that have too much 25 drinking? Does that have an effect on minors? I
15
Alderson Reporting Company

1 suppose so. 2 I -- I am not just concerned with the 3 vagueness. I am concerned with the vagueness, but I'm 4 concerned with the First Amendment, which says Congress 5 shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. And 6 it was always understood that the freedom of speech did 7 not include obscenity. It has never been understood 8 that the freedom of speech did not include portrayals of 9 violence. 10 You're -- you're asking us to create a -- a 11 whole new prohibition which the American people never - 12 never ratified when they ratified the First Amendment. 13 They knew there were -- you know, obscenity was -- was 14 bad, but what's next after violence? Drinking? 15 Smoking? Movies that show smoking can't be shown to 16 children? Does -- will that affect them? Of course, I 17 suppose it will. 18 But is -- is that -- are -- are we to sit 19 day by day to decide what else will be made an exception 20 from the First Amendment? Why -- why is this particular 21 exception okay, but the other ones that I just suggested 22 are not okay? 23 MR. MORAZZINI: Well, Justice Scalia, I 24 would like to highlight the fact that the material at 25 issue in Ginsberg was not obscene. Under no existing
16
Alderson Reporting Company

1 definition of obscenity was the partial nudity that this 2 Court allowed States to regulate minors' access to - 3 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think what 4 Justice Scalia wants to know is what James Madison 5 thought about video games. 6 (Laughter.) 7 JUSTICE ALITO: Did he enjoy them? 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I want to know what 9 James Madison thought about violence. Was there any 10 indication that anybody thought, when the First 11 Amendment was adopted, that there -- there was an 12 exception to it for -- for speech regarding violence? 13 Anybody? 14 MR. MORAZZINI: Your Honor, as to minors, I 15 believe, looking at some of the historic statutes States 16 had passed, had enacted in the past, there was a social 17 recognition that there is a level of violent material - 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the earliest 19 statute? 20 MR. MORAZZINI: Pardon? 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the earliest 22 statute and how much enforcement was entered? 23 MR. MORAZZINI: Your Honor, I don't know the 24 earliest statute off the top of my head. I believe they 25 go back into the early 1900s, perhaps later. I
17

1 apologize, but I don't know that - 2 JUSTICE BREYER: But, on the principle, I 3 mean, it's been quite some years, hasn't it, before this 4 -- since this Court has held that one instance that 5 courts -- that the country, legislatures, can regulate 6 are fighting words? And we regulate fighting words, 7 don't we? 8 MR. MORAZZINI: Absolutely. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Because they provoke 10 violence. And the American Psychological Association 11 and the American Pediatric Association have said that 12 certain kinds of video games here create violence when 13 children are exposed. There are 80 people who think to 14 the contrary. There are two huge things of meta 15 studies that think that -- not to the contrary. All 16 right. So what are we supposed to do? 17 MR. MORAZZINI: Well, Justice Breyer, I 18 think, in going back to Justice Scalia's question, I 19 find it hard to believe, and I know of no historical 20 evidence that suggests, that our Founding Fathers, in 21 enacting the First Amendment, intended to guarantee 22 video game retailers' First Amendment right - 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I go back to -- to 24 what Justice Breyer was asking? Because this Court, 25 with respect to the fighting words -- Chaplinsky and "in
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 your face" and provoke an immediate action -- the Court 2 has been very careful to cordon that off so it doesn't 3 have this spillover potential. So you -- you didn't 4 latch on to fighting words. Your analogy is to 5 obscenity for teenagers, as I understand it. 6 MR. MORAZZINI: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. With 7 regard to fighting words, the -- the societal interest 8 in preventing acts of violence is -- is different than 9 the concern at issue here today. 10 JUSTICE KAGAN: So could I just make -- make 11 sure I understand that, Mr. Morazzini, because, as I 12 understand, the State has given up its argument that the 13 interest protected by this law is an interest in 14 preventing minors who see these games from going out and 15 committing violent acts themselves; that the State is 16 not saying that that's the interest in the law; is that 17 correct? That instead the State is saying that the 18 interest in the law is in protecting children's moral 19 development generally? 20 MR. MORAZZINI: Justice Kagan, we welcome 21 that as -- as an effect of California's regulation, but 22 the primary interest was the internal intrinsic harm to 23 minors. That's what the State of California is deeply 24 concerned with in this case. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have a point of
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 clarification. Justice Ginsburg talked about the 2 labeling parts of this Act. The circuit court struck 3 those portions of the Act. You have not challenged that 4 ruling. 5 MR. MORAZZINI: Justice - 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There are two sections 7 to the Act. 8 MR. MORAZZINI: Sure. 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: One is a criminal act 10 for selling to a minor, and the other is a requirement 11 that you label in a certain way each video. The 12 district court said both were -- I think the circuit 13 court said both were unconstitutional, correct? 14 MR. MORAZZINI: Yes, Justice Sotomayor. 15 They found - 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And your brief has not 17 addressed the labeling requirements at all. 18 MR. MORAZZINI: Well, we didn't, Your Honor, 19 because one holding of the Ninth Circuit hinged upon the 20 other. In striking down the body of California's law, 21 the restriction on the sale, the court found that since 22 it's not illegal to sell these games to 18-year-olds, 23 that the governmental purpose served behind the label 24 itself was -- was in fact misleading. So under the 25 Zauderer case law -- I don't have the case cite before
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 me -- but under Zauderer regarding lawyers' advertising 2 of -- of services, it's -- the government can require a 3 labeling, so long as it's necessary to prevent 4 misleading the consumer. 5 The Ninth Circuit found that because they 6 struck down the body of our law, that the "18" label 7 would be misleading. So that - 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's an interesting 9 concession on your part, that the labeling doesn't have 10 a need separate from the restriction on sale. I would 11 have thought that if you wanted a lesser restriction, 12 that you would have promoted labeling as a reasonable 13 strict scrutiny restriction to permit the control of 14 sale of these materials to minors, but you seem to have 15 given up that argument altogether. 16 MR. MORAZZINI: Justice Sotomayor, I 17 certainly did not attempt or intend to concede that the 18 Ninth Circuit's opinion was correct in any sense in this 19 case. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you have conceded 21 it by not appealing it, but okay. We're not -- your 22 case on labeling rises and falls on the sale to minors? 23 MR. MORAZZINI: At this point, I would 24 agree, Your Honor. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does California -

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: I gather that -- that if - 2 if the parents of the minor want the kid to watch this 3 violent stuff, they like gore, they may even like 4 violent kids - 5 (Laughter.) 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- then -- then the State 7 of California has no objection, right? So long as the 8 parent buys the thing, it's perfectly okay. 9 MR. MORAZZINI: Your Honor, under Ginsberg, 10 they're entitled to direct the development and the 11 upbringing of their children in the manner they see fit. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 13 MR. MORAZZINI: It's important to the State 14 of California that the parent -- that we ensure that the 15 parent can involve themselves in this important 16 decision. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so that's basically 18 all this is, is a -- a law to help parents; is that 19 right? 20 MR. MORAZZINI: It's one of the two 21 fundamental interests that are served by this law, yes, 22 ensuring that parents can involve themselves in the 23 front end. California sought to erect a barrier in 24 between a retail sales clerk and a minor with regard to 25 violent material, just as we allow for minors' access to
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 sexual material, because California sees that the 2 developmental harm that could be caused to minors is no 3 less significant than that recognized by this Court in 4 -- in Ginsberg with regard to minors' exposure to sexual 5 material. Now, again, the material at issue in Ginsberg 6 was not obscene. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think there's any 8 barrier in California to minors' access to sexual 9 material? 10 MR. MORAZZINI: I -- I believe California 11 has a law, Penal Code Section 313.1. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: California has a 13 Ginsberg-type law. 14 MR. MORAZZINI: Yes. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: Does your office spend a lot 16 of time enforcing that? 17 MR. MORAZZINI: I'm not aware, 18 Justice Alito. But there is a proscription on the sale 19 of sexual material to minors. It's defined as harmful 20 to minors, similar to California's Act. In fact, 21 California's Act, in incorporating the three prongs of 22 Miller, goes even further than the Ginsberg law at issue 23 in Ginsberg v. New York. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- you've been 25 asked questions about the vagueness of this and the
23
Alderson Reporting Company

1 problem for the seller to know what's good and what's 2 bad. California -- does California have any kind of an 3 advisory opinion, an office that will view these videos 4 and say, yes, this belongs in this -- what did you call 5 it -- deviant violence, and this one is just violent but 6 not deviant? Is there -- is there any kind of opinion 7 that the -- that the seller can get to know which games 8 can be sold to minors and which ones can't? 9 MR. MORAZZINI: Not that I'm aware of, 10 Justice Ginsburg. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: You should consider 12 creating such a thing. You might call it the California 13 office of censorship. It would -- it would judge each 14 of these videos one by one. That would be very nice. 15 MR. MORAZZINI: Your Honor, we -- we ask 16 juries to judge sexual material and its appropriateness 17 for minors as well. I believe that if -- if we can view 18 the - 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we let the government do 20 that? Juries are not controllable. That's the 21 wonderful thing about juries, also the worst thing about 22 juries. But - 23 (Laughter.) 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: But do we let government 25 pass upon -- you know, a board of censors? I don't

1 think so. 2 MR. MORAZZINI: Justice Scalia, California's 3 not doing that here. The standard is quite similar to 4 that in the sexual material realm. California is not 5 acting as a censor. It is telling manufacturers and 6 distributors to look at your material and to judge for 7 yourselves whether or not the level of violent content 8 meets the prongs of this definition. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I can see your white 10 light's on. But even if we get past what I think are 11 difficult questions about vagueness and how to interpret 12 this law, isn't there a less restrictive alternative 13 with the -- a V-chip? 14 MR. MORAZZINI: Well, Your Honor, I believe 15 you're referring to the parental controls that are 16 available - 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. 18 MR. MORAZZINI: -- on some of the new 19 machines. As we submitted in our briefing, a simple 20 Internet search for bypassing parental controls brings 21 up video clips instructing minors and young adults how 22 to bypass the parental controls, so - 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So V-chips don't work. 24 MR. MORAZZINI: I believe the V-chip is 25 limited to television, Justice Kennedy.

SMITH 7 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 8 MR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 9 please the Court: 10 The California law at issue restricts the 11 distribution of expressive works based on their content. 12 California, as we've heard today, does not seriously 13 contend that it can satisfy the usual First Amendment 14 standards that apply to such a law. Instead, it's 15 asking this Court to grant it a new free pass, a 16 brand-new Ginsberg-like exception to the First Amendment 17 that would deny constitutional protection to some 18 ill-defined subset of expressive works and, I submit, 19 not just video games, but necessarily movies, books, and 20 any other expressive work that describes or portrays 21 violence in a way that some court somewhere, some day, 22 would decide is deviant and offensive. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- the 24 distinction between books and movies may be that, in 25 these video games, the child is not sitting there
26
Alderson Reporting Company

1 passively watching something; the child is doing the 2 killing. The child is doing the maiming. And I suppose 3 that might be understood to have a different impact on 4 the child's moral development. 5 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, it might. The 6 -- the State of California has not marshaled a shred of 7 evidence to suggest it's true. And if you look at the 8 social science - 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was -- what was 10 the state of the record that was present before the 11 Court in Ginsberg? 12 MR. SMITH: The state of the record was that 13 they were aware of science on both sides, but made a 14 judgment that as a matter of common sense, they could 15 decide that obscenity, even somewhat at-large 16 obscenity - 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the Court acted 18 on the basis of common sense? 19 MR. SMITH: Yes. It said as long as there's 20 science on both sides, but in that particular area, 21 which is an exception based -- that goes back to the 22 founding, they felt that it was -- it was proper for 23 them to adjust the outer boundaries of the exception. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the material wasn't 25 obscene. They were girlie magazines. I imagine to
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 today's children they would seem rather tame - 2 MR. SMITH: Well - 3 (Laughter.) 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the magazines 5 involved. But they were definitely not obscene with 6 respect to adults. 7 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, that's 8 certainly true, but one of the things about the case 9 that is important to recognize, they didn't pass on the 10 particular material before the Court. They simply said, 11 is this somewhat larger a definition of variable 12 obscenity going to be acceptable to - 13 JUSTICE BREYER: Talking about common sense, 14 why isn't it common sense to say that if a parent wants 15 his 13-year-old child to have a game where the child is 16 going to sit there and imagine he's a torturer and 17 impose gratuitous, painful, excruciating, torturing 18 violence upon small children and women, and do this for 19 an hour or so, and there is no social or redeeming 20 value, it's not artistic, it's not literary, et 21 cetera -- why isn't it common sense to say a State has 22 the right to say, parent, if you want that for your 23 13-year-old, you go buy it yourself. Which I think is 24 what they're saying. 25 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, the State has
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to have some reason to think that parents - 2 JUSTICE BREYER: It does, it does. What it 3 has is -- and I've looked at the studies, perhaps not as 4 thoroughly as you, but it seemed to me that Dr. Ferguson 5 and Dr. Anderson are in a disagreement. They aren't in 6 that much of a disagreement actually, but they've looked 7 in depth at a whole lot of video games, not movies 8 they're talking about or other things; they're talking 9 about video games. 10 And both groups come to the conclusion that 11 there is some tendency to increase violence. And the 12 American Psychiatric -- Psychological Association and 13 the American Pediatric Association sign on to a long 14 list on -- I think it's the Anderson side that this does 15 hurt children. 16 I have to admit that if I'm supposed to be a 17 sociological expert, I can't choose between them. But 18 if I can say could a legislature have enough evidence to 19 think there's harm, the answer is yes. 20 MR. SMITH: There is two aspects of harm. 21 The one I was about to address was the question of 22 whether parents need additional help in exercising the 23 role that they have played throughout the history - 24 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. They need additional 25 help because many parents are not home when their
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 children come home from school. Many parents have jobs, 2 I -- we hope. And -- and when -- when their children 3 are there, they do what they want. And all this says 4 is, if you want that gratuitous torture of, let's say 5 babies, to make it as bad as possible, what you do, 6 parent, is you go buy it; don't let him buy it on his 7 own, and he's 13 years old. Now, what's the common 8 sense or what's the science of that? 9 MR. SMITH: Well, two aspects. With respect 10 to parental controls, Your Honor, there's a whole 11 variety -- a whole series of things that parents have 12 available to them and are using today to deal with any 13 concerns that they have about what's appropriate for 14 their children. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't want to 16 interrupt your answer, but any 13-year-old can bypass 17 parental controls in about 5 minutes. 18 MR. SMITH: That is one element of about 19 five different elements, Your Honor. And if I could 20 talk about them -- there is the ratings. Parents are 21 doing the purchasing 90 percent of the time. Even if 22 the child does the purchasing, they bring the game home, 23 the parent can review it. 24 The game is being played in the home on the 25 family television or computer most of the time. Any
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 harm that's supposed to be inflicted on them is supposed 2 to take place over a period of years, not minutes, so 3 the parent has ample opportunity to exercise parental 4 supervision over what games are being played in the 5 house. Plus there is the parental controls, which are 6 very similar to the ones that the Court has found to be 7 significant in the Playboy case, in the COPA case, in a 8 whole variety of cases. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: How much do these videos 10 cost? 11 MR. SMITH: They cost in the range of $50 to 12 $60 when new, Your Honor. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not too many 13-year-olds 14 walk in with a $50 bill, do they? 15 MR. SMITH: It seems very likely that the 16 people, if there are any out there, buying games without 17 parental permission -- which the State, by the way, has 18 not even tried to show -- they are very likely in the 19 16-year-old category. The - 20 JUSTICE BREYER: You're away from the common 21 sense. If you're going back to the common sense of it, 22 what common sense is there in having a state of the law 23 that a State can forbid and says to the parent the 24 child, the 13-year-old, cannot go in and buy a picture 25 of a naked woman, but the 13-year-old child can go in
31

1 and buy one of these video games as I have described? 2 I've tried to take as bad a one as I could think of, 3 gratuitous torture of children. Okay? Now, you can't 4 buy a naked woman, but you can go and buy that, you say 5 to the 13-year-old. Now -- now, what sense is there to 6 that? 7 MR. SMITH: Well, there's -- there's various 8 aspects of this that I think it's important to 9 understand. First of all, violence has been a feature 10 of works that we create for children and encouraged them 11 to watch throughout the history of this country. We 12 have a very different sense of whether violence 13 per se - 14 JUSTICE BREYER: You mean love is not 15 something that people have tried to encourage children 16 to understand and know about? I mean, what's the 17 difference between sex and violence? Both, if anything? 18 MR. SMITH: There's a huge difference. The 19 difference is - 20 JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you. I understand 21 that. 22 (Laughter.) 23 MR. SMITH: We do not -- the difference is 24 we do not make films for children in which explicit sex 25 happens. We do make films for children in which graphic
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 violence happens - 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Graphic violence. 3 There is a difference. We do not have a tradition in 4 this country of telling children they should watch 5 people actively hitting schoolgirls over the head with a 6 shovel so they'll beg with mercy, being merciless and 7 decapitating them, shooting people in the leg so they 8 fall down -- I'm reading from the district court 9 description -- pour gasoline over them, set them on 10 fire, and urinate on them. We do not have a tradition 11 in this country. We protect children from that. We 12 don't actively expose them to that. 13 MR. SMITH: And -- and parents have been 14 doing that for -- since time immemorial. The question 15 before this Court is whether you're going to create an 16 entirely new exception under the First Amendment, 17 whether parents need to have such a new exception 18 created, and whether or not, if you're going to do it, 19 you could possibly figure out what the scope of that 20 exception is. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it your position 22 -- I know this is a facial challenge, Mr. Smith. So is 23 it your position that the First Amendment could not 24 prohibit the sale to minors of the video game that I 25 just described?
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. SMITH: My position is that most people 2 would think that that's an inappropriate game for 3 minors -- we do not try to sell it to minors -- but that 4 the Constitution should not be - 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know you don't, 6 but what is -- you're avoiding the answer. Does the 7 First Amendment protect the sale of that video to 8 minors? 9 MR. SMITH: My position - 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A minor? 11 MR. SMITH: -- is that there is not a 12 violence exception to the First Amendment for minors, 13 and there should not be. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position is 15 that the First Amendment does not, cannot, no matter 16 what type of law, whether this one is vague or not, that 17 the State legislature cannot pass a law that says you 18 may not sell to a 10-year-old a video in which they set 19 schoolgirls on fire. 20 MR. SMITH: And the reason for that is 21 there's no possible way, it's an insuperable problem, to 22 use the English language to draw up an exception to the 23 Constitution, to the First Amendment, that would - 24 JUSTICE ALITO: But what if -- what if a 25 State passes a -- what if California took the list of
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 video games that your association rates as mature and 2 said there's a civil penalty? And you apparently don't 3 want your -- you don't want vendors selling those games 4 to minors; isn't that right? 5 MR. SMITH: Exercising our First Amendment 6 rights, we have decided - 7 JUSTICE ALITO: You don't want that. And, 8 now, what if California said there's a civil penalty 9 attached to that? 10 MR. SMITH: What that would do is transform 11 the ESRB, the private voluntary system that exists, into 12 the -- the censorship commission that this Court struck 13 down in Interstate Circuit. When you -- when the 14 government does that and you have to go to them for 15 permission to allow kids into the movies or to play this 16 game, it is a prior restraint. You have way too much 17 discretion. It's a licensing authority that the First 18 Amendment doesn't allow. 19 JUSTICE ALITO: You seem to argue that - 20 that there really is no good reason to think that 21 exposure to video games is -- is bad for minors, 22 exposure to really violent video games is bad to minors; 23 is that right? 24 MR. SMITH: I think it's important to draw a 25 distinction between harm that could be cognizable under
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the law and appropriateness. Families have different 2 judgments that they make about their children at 3 different ages and with different content and different 4 family values, and that's what - 5 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Smith, is there 6 any showing that the State could make that would satisfy 7 you, that would say, yes, that's a sufficient showing 8 for this law to go forward? 9 You know, I understand that you think that 10 the current studies don't suggest much of anything about 11 harm. 12 MR. SMITH: No, they don't. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: But -- but are there studies 14 that would be enough? 15 MR. SMITH: Well, I guess I can imagine a 16 world in which expression could transform 75 percent of 17 the people who experience it into murderers. That's 18 clearly not the way the human mind works. And here the 19 reality is quite the opposite. Dr. Anderson testified 20 in the Illinois trial, which is in the record, that the 21 vast majority of people playing the games will grow up 22 and be just fine. And, in fact, he -- he acknowledged 23 that the effects of these games are not one whit 24 different from watching cartoons on television or 25 reading violent passages in the Bible or looking at a
36

1 picture of a gun. 2 JUSTICE ALITO: So why - 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you really don't want 4 to argue the case on that ground. I -- I gather you 5 don't believe that the First Amendment reads: Congress 6 shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech except 7 those that make sense. Is that - 8 MR. SMITH: Your Honor, my main ground today 9 is exactly that, that this Court said last year in 10 United States v. Stevens it doesn't have a freewheeling 11 authority to create new exceptions to the First 12 Amendment after 200 years based on a cost-benefit 13 analysis, and this is -- this is a test of that. This 14 is exactly what the State of California is asking you to 15 do. 16 JUSTICE ALITO: But we have here a new -- a 17 new medium that cannot possibly have been envisioned at 18 the time when the First Amendment was ratified. It is 19 totally different from -- it's one thing to read a 20 description of -- as one of these -- one of these video 21 games is promoted as saying, "What's black and white and 22 red all over? Perhaps the answer could include 23 disposing of your enemies in a meat grinder." Now, 24 reading that is one thing. Seeing it as graphically 25 portrayed -
37
Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: And doing it. 2 JUSTICE ALITO: -- and doing it is still a 3 third thing. 4 So this presents a question that could not 5 have been specifically contemplated at the time when the 6 First Amendment was adopted. And to say, well, because 7 nobody was -- because descriptions in a book of violence 8 were not considered a category of speech that was 9 appropriate for limitation at the time when the First 10 Amendment was violated is entirely artificial. 11 MR. SMITH: We do have a new medium here, 12 Your Honor, but we have a history in this country of new 13 mediums coming along and people vastly overreacting to 14 them, thinking the sky is falling, our children are all 15 going to be turned into criminals. 16 It started with the crime novels of the late 17 19th century, which produced this raft of legislation 18 which was never enforced. It started with comic books 19 and movies in the 1950s. There were hearings across the 20 street in the 1950s where social scientists came in and 21 intoned to the Senate that half the juvenile delinquency 22 in this country was being caused by reading comic books, 23 and there was enormous pressure on the industry. They 24 censored -- they self-censored. We have television. We 25 have rock lyrics. We have the Internet.

1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Smith, do you think all 2 video games are speech in the first instance? Because 3 you could look at these games and say they're the 4 modern-day equivalent of Monopoly sets. They're games. 5 They're things that people use to compete. You know, 6 when you think about some of them -- the first video 7 game was Pong. It was playing tennis on your TV. How 8 is that speech at all? 9 MR. SMITH: The games that we are talking 10 about have narrative, events that are occurring, 11 characters, plot. And that's exactly what the State has 12 set out to regulate here. It says if these events occur 13 here -- there is violence, one person is hurting another 14 person -- it has to be a human being who's the victim - 15 and it's doing it in a -- in a way that they find 16 offensive in some way, we're going to regulate it. So, 17 obviously, what - 18 JUSTICE KAGAN: So are we going to separate 19 video games into narrative video games and non-narrative 20 video games? 21 MR. SMITH: You don't have to, as long as 22 the law is limited to regulating narrative. That's what 23 this law is limited to. Now, if the law said you 24 shouldn't buy -- play games that have red images that 25 appear in them, or something else that was somehow
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 non-content based, that might be a closer case. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what -- what about a 3 law that says you can't sell to minors a video game - 4 it doesn't care what the plot is, but no video game in 5 which the minor commits violent acts of maiming, 6 killing, setting people on fire? What about that? 7 Would that -- would that be regulating speech? 8 MR. SMITH: Well, of course, Your Honor. 9 That's exactly what -- what - 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not speech. You're 11 saying you just can't let the kid maim -- maim, kill - 12 MR. SMITH: I'm sorry. Were you - 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- or set on fire. What 14 the law would be directed at is not the plot, not the 15 video game itself, but the child's act of -- of 16 committing murder, maiming, and so forth. 17 MR. SMITH: Well, the events in a video game 18 are -- what happens in the plot is a combination of what 19 the game gives you and what the player adds to it. 20 There's a -- there's a creative aspect coming at it from 21 the other side. It's often referred to as a dialogue 22 between the player and the game. I would submit that 23 both are completely protected by the First Amendment. 24 Just as a person actually - 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: The child is speaking to
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the game? 2 MR. SMITH: No. The child is helping to 3 make the plot, determine what happens in the events that 4 appear on the screen, just as an actor helps to portray 5 what happens in a play. You're acting out certain 6 elements of the play, and you're contributing to the 7 events that occur and adding a creative element of your 8 own. That's what makes them different and in many ways 9 wonderful. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Smith, your - 11 your challenge is a facial challenge? 12 MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that under - 14 whether you use the Salerno test or the Glucksberg test, 15 if there is either one or any applications that would 16 satisfy the Constitution, the facial challenge fails. 17 Right? 18 MR. SMITH: Very clear under the law of this 19 Court that those tests don't apply in a First Amendment 20 context if the -- the - 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought we 22 referenced them last year in the Stevens case, and the 23 only reason we didn't have to decide which applies is 24 because we adopted an approach that looked at 25 overbreadth and said this statute is overbroad and
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 specifically didn't decide whether it could be applied 2 in that case to -- to crush videos. 3 MR. SMITH: Well, that's -- that's correct, 4 Your Honor, but I think it's -- there's no argument 5 here, I don't think, that if you can find one game out 6 there to which this can constitutionally be applied, 7 even though it would also be unconstitutionally applied 8 under the vast run of other cases - 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I 10 understood -- the tenor of much of the questioning, I 11 think, is that there may be games and may be minors - 12 maybe a less violent game sold to a 17-year-old, perhaps 13 that violates the First Amendment, but something like 14 Postal 2 sold to a 10-year-old might -- might well not 15 violate the First Amendment to apply this law to that. 16 MR. SMITH: Well, that may be - 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the way we 18 approached the issue in Stevens, where we had hunting 19 videos and crush videos, would say that it's too broad 20 to apply the law to everything, so we strike it down, 21 it's overbroad, but leave open the possibility that a 22 more narrowly drawn statute might pass muster. 23 Why -- why isn't that a good approach here? 24 MR. SMITH: You certainly could do that. 25 Certainly, the key thing is that you strike down this
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 law, because this law is clearly much broader than any 2 one game. I would submit to you, though, that there's 3 no way, in fact, anybody is going to be able to come 4 back and draw a statute that gets to what they claim, 5 because the English language is not susceptible of that 6 level of precision. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So it's not 8 susceptible. Throughout you've been arguing your point, 9 which is fair. You have some experts who -- who favor 10 you, and you make that point very strongly, and your 11 point's a pretty good one and a serious one, that it's 12 very hard to draw this line under traditional First 13 Amendment standards. 14 But I'd like you to deal with their point 15 for a moment. And I take it their point is: There is 16 no new First Amendment thing here. There is a 17 category -- call them X -- which really are involving 18 things like torturing children, et cetera. Maybe you 19 don't like to sell them to anybody. You have them X'd 20 or some special thing. But they exist, and they fit 21 within a Miller-type definition. They are much worse 22 than the simple girlie magazine that was involved there. 23 And they will use traditional First Amendment tests; 24 that is to say, there is speech at issue, that speech is 25 being limited, it is being done for a good reason,
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 compelling interest -- namely, this problem with the X 2 videos and the torture and living it through -- and 3 there is no less restrictive alternative that isn't also 4 significantly less effective. 5 See, I want you to deal with that directly, 6 because what you have been doing for the most part is 7 saying we have to be in some new, total new area, et 8 cetera. But their argument is you don't have to be in 9 some totally new area, et cetera. Apply traditional 10 First Amendment standards, and we win. That's their 11 argument, and I'd like to hear what you have to say 12 about that, specifically. 13 MR. SMITH: Your Honor, they do not suggest 14 that there's any existing exception to the First 15 Amendment that would apply to violence. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: This is not an exception. 17 It is the traditional strict scrutiny First Amendment 18 test. 19 MR. SMITH: Well, they make a feint at 20 trying to argue that - 21 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then let's - 22 to get you to focus on it, I'll say I've made the 23 argument. 24 (Laughter.) 25 MR. SMITH: There you go. Your Honor, I
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 think if you apply strict scrutiny here, they do not 2 come close to the kind of showing that would be required 3 under -- under the First Amendment. 4 First of all, they have not shown any 5 problem, let alone a compelling problem, requiring 6 regulation here in a world where parents are fully 7 empowered already to make these calls, where crime, 8 including violent crime, since the introduction of these 9 games, has been plummeting in this country, down 50 10 percent since the day Doom first went on the market 11 15 years ago; in a world where parents are fully aware 12 of what's going on in their homes and aware of the 13 ratings system and can use all the other tools that we 14 have talked about - 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they have plenty of 16 evidence that - 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why couldn't you make the 18 same arguments with respect to the obscenity statutes? 19 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, because 20 obscenity doesn't have strict scrutiny applied to it, if 21 it did, I expect you could make the same arguments, if 22 there were - 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why shouldn't violence be 24 treated the same as obscenity? 25 MR. SMITH: Well, because, first of all, we
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 don't have the same history of it. There's no 2 historical pedigree of that kind of an exception. And, 3 as I was suggesting earlier, there's a fundamental 4 difference factually, which is Ginsberg works tolerably 5 well because we take everything that's sexually explicit 6 and appeals to a prurient interest, and we say over 7 here, it's not appropriate for minors. 8 Violence would require you to draw a much 9 different line between acceptable protected violence and 10 unacceptable unprotected violence for minors, and that 11 given the lack of historical pedigree but also just 12 given the nature of what you're trying to do - 13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the courts - 14 MR. SMITH: -- that's a - 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The courts struggled for 16 many, many years and are to some extent still struggling 17 with obscenity. They came up with basically what we 18 might call the Miller standards. And -- and the State 19 has said this gives us a category that we can work with, 20 with reference to violence. 21 MR. SMITH: And if you take the Miller 22 standards and you take two things out of it -- you take 23 out of it explicit sex and nudity, and you take out an 24 appeal to prurient interest -- what do you have left? 25 You have left -- what you have is a structure with no
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 apparent meaning. There is no way to know how a court 2 would apply a standard like deviant violence, morbid 3 violence, offensive violence, let alone decide which 4 video games have a redeeming social, political, artistic 5 value. 6 The value of a video game is completely in 7 the eye of the beholder. Some would say they're 8 beautiful works of artistic creation; others would 9 say - 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You could make all those 11 arguments with reference to obscenity. 12 MR. SMITH: Except that you know -- we know, 13 we all know, at least with respect to Ginsberg -- adult 14 obscenity, I would acknowledge, is a very difficult 15 line. Adult -- Ginsberg works reasonably well, because 16 if it has sex in it and naked people having sex in it 17 and it's designed to be appealing to people's prurient 18 interests, you don't give it to minors. And you don't 19 have a lot of cases out there about that. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and you started 21 Ginsberg with something that is proscribable even with 22 regard to adults. 23 MR. SMITH: Correct, Your Honor. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: You know that there is such 25 a thing as -- as obscenity, which can be proscribed even
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 -- even as to adults; whereas in this case, I don't know 2 that there's such a thing as morbid violence which could 3 be eliminated from ordinary movies. 4 MR. SMITH: Let me -- I think a little 5 history is helpful here. This Court has twice dealt 6 with laws attempting to regulate violent works in the 7 past. One was in Winters v. New York, where law applied 8 to magazines and books, and one was in the 1960s. On 9 the very day Ginsberg came down, in the Interstate 10 Circuit case, the City of Dallas had an ordinance where 11 there was going to be a commission that was going to 12 review each movie and decide if it was appropriate for 13 children. 14 JUSTICE ALITO: Let me be clear about 15 exactly what your argument is. Your argument is that 16 there is nothing that a State can do to limit minors' 17 access to the most violent, sadistic, graphic video game 18 that can be developed. That's your argument? 19 MR. SMITH: My position is - 20 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it or isn't it? 21 MR. SMITH: My position is that strict 22 scrutiny applies, and that given the facts in the 23 record, given the fact that the -- the problem is 24 already well controlled, the parents are already 25 empowered, and there are greatly less alternatives out

1 there - 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, when you - 3 MR. SMITH: -- there isn't any basis to say 4 scrutiny is satisfied. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, when you say that - 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, just to be 7 clear, your answer to Justice Alito is, at this point, 8 there is nothing the State can do? 9 MR. SMITH: Because there's no problem it 10 needs to solve that would justify - 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I -- could I 12 just have a simple answer? 13 MR. SMITH: The answer is yes, Your Honor. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's nothing the 15 State can do. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Smith, how can you 17 say that? There's plenty of proof that -- that children 18 are going into stores and buying these games despite the 19 voluntary rating system, despite the voluntary retailer 20 restraint by some. There's still proof out there, and 21 an abundance of it, that kids are buying the games. 22 MR. SMITH: I disagree. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And there's proof that 24 some parents, as well-intentioned as they may or may not 25 be, have not been able to supervise that. So I -

1 starting from the proposition that there is a problem, 2 it's a compelling State need, why are you arguing that 3 there is no solution that the State could use to address 4 that problem? 5 MR. SMITH: The -- the existing solutions 6 are perfectly capable of allowing this problem to be 7 addressed, assuming it is a problem. And I would - 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's still about 20 9 percent of sales are going to kids. 10 MR. SMITH: That's when they send in 11 somebody who's 16 to test the system. There isn't any 12 evidence at all in this record that actual children, not 13 testers, are in fact disobeying their parents and 14 secretly buying these games, bringing them into the 15 home, and playing them for years with their parents 16 unaware of it. There's simply no evidence of that at 17 all. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you have a law 19 that says the State has to put -- the dealers have to 20 put the violent video games in a particular area of the 21 video store? 22 MR. SMITH: There -- there is - 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That is not -- and 24 then -- you know, and minors are not allowed in that 25 area.

1 MR. SMITH: Well, if what you're saying is 2 you're going to have a limit on the ability of minors to 3 buy them because of walled off, and minors are not 4 allowed - 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 6 MR. SMITH: -- to go pick them off the 7 shelf, then I don't know how that differs from the 8 current law, Your Honor, assuming you could figure 9 out - 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Your answer -- your answer 11 to the first question of Justice Alito and the Chief 12 Justice was yes, isn't that -- that you are saying 13 there's nothing they can do. So now, am I right about 14 that or am I not right? 15 MR. SMITH: Yes. Strict scrutiny does not 16 make sense - 17 JUSTICE BREYER: I am right? Okay. All I 18 wanted was an answer to that. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they can't say, 20 example, all the -- all the highest rated videos have to 21 be on the top shelf out of the reach of children. Can 22 they do that? 23 MR. SMITH: I would think that that's 24 probably not - 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what they do

1 with cigarettes or something, isn't it? 2 MR. SMITH: Except that cigarettes are not 3 speech, Your Honor. This is fully protected speech. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know that 5 cigarettes are not speech, Mr. Smith. 6 (Laughter.) 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Cigarettes are 8 something that we have determined are harmful to 9 children. The question is, you say the record doesn't 10 support the idea that these video games are harmful to 11 children. Some of us may conclude that it does. 12 MR. SMITH: Well, surely the record doesn't 13 support it. The record says that if -- even if you take 14 the studies at face value, it's not one whit more 15 harmful than watching television cartoons. That's what 16 the record shows. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But on that -- on that 18 score, Mr. Smith, there is a study by the FCC. The 19 question is whether violence can be restricted during 20 the hours when most children are awake, just the way 21 pornography is. I don't remember what -- what are the 22 hours, that -- something like from 10:00 in the evening 23 until - 24 I don't -- but -- but didn't the FCC say, 25 yes, we could do the same thing for violence that we're

1 doing for sex, except we don't think we ought to do it; 2 we think Congress should do it? 3 MR. SMITH: What they did was they spent 4 several years trying to come up with a definition that 5 would allow anybody to figure out which violent TV shows 6 have to be put into this adult category and which don't, 7 and they eventually punted and said we have no idea how 8 to do that; Congress asked us to do it; we cannot do it; 9 and they punted it back to Congress to try to come up 10 with a definition. 11 This is a very difficult task, trying to use 12 language to differentiate levels of violence or types of 13 violence in a manner that would in some way tell people 14 what the rules of the game are. I think, even if you 15 think that there's some problem out there that needs to 16 be solved, you ought to think very carefully about 17 whether or not you're going to authorize the creation of 18 some new rule authorizing regulation in this area, when 19 no one will have any idea what the scope of it is. 20 JUSTICE ALITO: And you say there's no 21 problem because 16-year-olds in California never have 22 $50 available to go buy a video game and because they 23 never have TVs in their room, and their parents are 24 always home watching what they -- they do with their 25 video games, and the parents -- and the video games have
53

1 features that allow parents to block access, to block 2 the playing of violent video games, which can't be 3 overcome by a computer-savvy California 16-year-old; 4 that's why there's no problem, right? 5 MR. SMITH: I guess, if what we're really 6 going to do is judge the constitutionality of this law 7 based on what 16- and 17-year-olds are getting and 8 whether that would be harmful to them, I think the 9 problem there is the line between 16 and 17 and 18 is so 10 fine, that you're not going to be able to identify any 11 real category of games that fits into that category. 12 And it's important, by the way, to -- to 13 note that California hasn't told us whether we should 14 judge it for 5-year-olds, 10-year-olds, 17-year-olds. 15 If it's 5-year-olds, then it's vastly over-restrictive; 16 if it's 17-year-olds, I suspect -- I suspect it wouldn't 17 restrict anything because nobody is going to be able to 18 convince a -- jury, well, this is an 18-year-old game, 19 not a 17-year-old game. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We draw that kind of 21 line of course in the death penalty area, don't we? 22 Between 18-year-olds? You are under 18; you can't be 23 sentenced to life without parole; if you were over 18, 24 you can. 25 MR. SMITH: You do draw that line, Your

1 Honor. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And we do it for 3 drinking; we do it for driving. 4 MR. SMITH: But here you're assessing works 5 of expression and trying to decide what age they -- they 6 would correspond to, and I don't think you can cut it 7 that finely and say, well, this is an 18 game; this is 8 only a 17 game. I just don't think that works. So if 9 that's the test, the test Justice Breyer suggested it 10 ought to be, then the statute essentially would restrict 11 nothing. If the test is 5-year-olds - 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Stick to the X things, 13 maybe. Maybe it would restrict the total gratuitous 14 torture. And if that's what it restricted, why is that 15 such a terrible thing? 16 MR. SMITH: Well, first of all - 17 JUSTICE BREYER: And as you experimented 18 with other things, as they did in the obscenity area, 19 you could discover you could limit it to that. 20 MR. SMITH: I think the "maybe" is telling, 21 though, Your Honor. Somebody, as Justice Scalia pointed 22 out, in publishing a game has to know what -- what to - 23 what the rules of the game are in advance, subject to 24 hundreds of millions of dollars of penalties. There's a 25 $1,000 a game penalty if you have the wrong -

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you have your rules, 2 so why wouldn't the first step be they'd follow your 3 rules? Your rules. The X things would be limited to 4 people who are over 18, and we'll see if we ever get 5 prosecuted for a different one. And you might never. 6 MR. SMITH: Our rules wouldn't help you at 7 all. They say that -- that -- they're only restricting 8 a smaller number, a small subset of M-rated games, 9 which, by the way, we say are appropriate for 10 17-year-olds. So you have -- these ratings that the 11 State wants us to impose are going to conflict with the 12 ratings that are already on the packaging which are 13 being used by parents every day to make these judgments. 14 So it's actually interfering -- the prospect of it would 15 interfere with the information already on the packaging. 16 Thank you. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 18 Smith. 19 Mr. Morazzini, you have 4 minutes remaining. 20 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ZACKERY P. MORAZZINI 21 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 22 MR. MORAZZINI: Thank you, 23 Mr. Chief Justice. 24 I wanted to address one point that has been 25 raised about minors' ability to access these games.
56
Alderson Reporting Company

1 Yes, new games do cost $60, but California's law also 2 regulates the rental of these video games, which is just 3 a few dollars per game. So minors certainly can afford 4 them and can access them. 5 But I also wanted to draw out the point that 6 California's law really is not an ordinance that's 7 directed to a plot of a game. It's expressly directed 8 to games with essentially no plot, no artistic value. 9 This is the helpful nature of the third prong of the 10 Miller standard. So it really is only going after the 11 nature of the game where the child is acting out - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. If it has a 13 plot, it has artistic value? Is that going to be the 14 test for artistic value? Anything that has a plot? 15 MR. MORAZZINI: It will be one factor to be 16 considered, Justice Scalia. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well - 18 MR. MORAZZINI: The nature of the plot and 19 the nature of the - 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, one factor to be 21 considered, sure. But you're not telling us that, so 22 long as it has a plot, it's okay? 23 MR. MORAZZINI: No. Your Honor, as this 24 Court held in the Jacobellis case, a single quotation 25 from Voltaire on the flyleaf of an otherwise obscene
57

1 work was not going to make that work non-obscene. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't have artistic 3 videos that involve maiming and cutting off heads and 4 eviscerating people, and pouring gas, right? So long as 5 its artistic, it's okay. 6 MR. MORAZZINI: No, if the -- if the level 7 of the violence -- just as in obscenity, if the level of 8 the violence causes the game as a whole to lack the 9 artistic -- it's -- it's a balance, Your Honor, just as 10 it is with sexual material. Each aspect -- that's why 11 violence and sex are so similar - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Artistic for whom? For a 13 5-year-old? What a 5-year-old would appreciate as great 14 art, is that going to be the test? 15 MR. MORAZZINI: No. Again, minors as a 16 class. So those under 18 years old. Those under - 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think Mortal Kombat 18 is prohibited by this statute? 19 MR. MORAZZINI: I believe it's a candidate, 20 Your Honor, but I haven't played the game and been 21 exposed to it sufficiently to judge for myself. 22 JUSTICE KAGAN: It's a candidate, meaning, 23 you know, yes, a reasonable jury could find that Mortal 24 Kombat -- which is, you know, an iconic game, which I'm 25 sure half of the clerks who work for us spent

1 considerable amounts of time in their adolescence 2 playing. 3 (Laughter.) 4 MR. MORAZZINI: Justice Kagan - 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what she's 6 talking about. 7 (Laughter.) 8 MR. MORAZZINI: Justice Kagan, by 9 "candidate," I meant that the video game industry should 10 look at it, should take a long look at it. Now -- but I 11 don't know off the top of my head. I'm willing to state 12 right here in open court that the video game Postal 2, 13 yes, would be covered by this Act. I'm willing to guess 14 that games we described in our brief, such as MadWorld, 15 would be covered by the Act. I think the video game 16 industry - 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would a video game that 18 portrayed a Vulcan, as opposed to a human being, being 19 maimed and tortured -- would that be covered by the Act? 20 MR. MORAZZINI: No, it wouldn't, Your Honor, 21 because the Act is only directed towards the range of 22 options that are able to be inflicted on a human being. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if the -- if the 24 video producer says this is not a human being, it's an 25 android computer-simulated person, then that doesn't -

1 all they have to do is put a little part or feature on 2 the creature and they could sell the video game? 3 MR. MORAZZINI: Under the Act, yes, because 4 California's concern -- I think this is one of the 5 reasons that sex and violence are so similar. These are 6 base physical acts we're talking about, Justice 7 Sotomayor. So limiting, narrowing our law here in 8 California -- there in California -- to violence, 9 violent depictions against human beings - 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what happens when the 11 character gets maimed, head chopped off, and immediately 12 after it happens they spring back to life and they 13 continue their battle? Is that covered by your Act? 14 Because they haven't been maimed and killed forever. 15 Just temporarily. 16 MR. MORAZZINI: I would think so. The 17 intent of the law is to limit minors' access to those 18 games - 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You think so? Isn't 20 that feedback to Justice Scalia's question? 21 MR. MORAZZINI: Well, Your Honor, this - 22 this is a facial challenge.
