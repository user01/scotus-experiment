  {
    "speaker": "BUSCH",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a gang-related murder in which a jury found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. There was one trial conducted, and the defendant was sentenced to life in prison. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in its conclusion that the Michigan Supreme Court's decision on double jeopardy was unreasonable. The AEDPA precludes habeas corpus relief where a State court makes reasonable factual determinations. The Michigan Supreme Court's decision was not only reasonable, but also correct. The Michigan Supreme Court's decision was correct for three reasons. First, this was a factual matter which was reasonably decided. Second, the trial judge's --"

  {
    "speaker": "BUSCH",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, the Michigan Supreme Court was evaluating what exactly this trial judge said. It was ambiguous. And in trying to determine what he said, then we could understand, or they could understand what he had done and what legal import that had."

    "speech": "But -- but there was no -- all I'm saying, there was no doubt about what -- what he said. The -- the legal import is -- may be much more difficult to figure out."

  {
    "speaker": "BUSCH",
    "speech": "Your Honor, the factual question in terms of what it was that he said is -- is different than what he had actually done. And therein lying -- understanding what this judge had done or said, the meaning of it, then would give us some understanding of what the legal import was."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I guess there are really three questions, aren't there? One is what he said, and there -- as the Chief Justice says, there's no dispute on what he said. The second question is what he meant by what he said. And the third question is, once you know what he meant, at law does that constitute a -- a final judgment."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BUSCH",
    "speech": "That -- it would be our position that it is a factual question and courts -- the Court in Parker versus Dugger and Wainwright versus Goode have dealt with this issue. Where we have ambiguous rulings of a trial judge, that has been found to be a factual --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I'm not sure actually -- your inference. I mean, it's quite a fine point, but I guess I wouldn't say necessarily that what he meant has anything to do with it. That is, he said certain things in the world, and if he had a secret meaning, we don't care nor does the law. But having said these particular things in the world, then the question would be, can the Michigan Supreme Court -- does it -- did it -- it characterized those things, and it said as a matter of Michigan law, those things said in the world do not amount to a judgment of acquittal. So then I guess we would -- if that's the way to look at it, then we would have the problem of deciding whether, even though as a matter of Michigan law, those events that took place in the world do not amount to a judgment of acquittal. Nonetheless, for purposes of the Federal Double Jeopardy Clause, do they amount to a judgment of acquittal? Those would be two legal questions. One, a State law question, and one, a Federal question, and no factual question."

And then at page 18 of the same exhibit, the court actually schedules an 8:30 motion the following day when the prosecutor in this case -- the assistant prosecutor asked the court if he could be heard. And the judge said, I'll be glad to hear you. And in fact, the court had originally scheduled the attorneys to be there at 10:00 and then changed the time for them to show up before the jury came back. And lastly I think it shows that no one who was involved in this case at the trial level actually believed that a final ruling had been made. The court says at page 34 -- excuse me. The defense counsel says -- and I'm quoting Mr. Odette -- that's correct. They don't -- I'm not disputing that, but it's my firm impression that when I left the court yesterday, that there had been a ruling and that Mr. Stamos had indicated he'd like to have the matter reconsidered. And I believe the court said, whatever. And what's instructive is what the judge said next. That's right. And I -- well, I said, yes, I'd be glad to listen, or words to that effect. Lastly --"

And it's really the same question that Justice Breyer and Justice Scalia I think were -- were raising. My understanding is that the courts, up to this point, have treated the issue here as an issue of fact. What was the judge -- what did the judge think he was doing? Did he understand or could one reasonably understand that the had made a final ruling or not? It might also have been treated as an issue of law. Given what the judge did, even if he thought he had made a final ruling, he might, as a matter of law, consistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause, have been able to change his mind if he hadn't issued a formal order and if no one had acted in reliance. But I understand that legal question, the way I just put it, is not the question that people understood has been decided in this case, and that everybody is treating this as a -- as an issue of the factual question and that's what you're addressing.

In other words, the Michigan court was correct because judges, trial judges in particular, need time to reflect. They're often making these decisions without trial transcripts, in many cases without extensive legal research."

You have -- your -- your opponent has to show that either it was an unreasonable application of our precedents or contrary to our precedents, if it's a legal question, and if it's a factual question, that the Michigan Supreme Court made unreasonable findings of fact."

That is especially so where, as here, a party promptly seeks reconsideration which necessarily renders the initial ruling inconclusive. That rule reflects four important legal and practical considerations. First, trial courts often must rule swiftly without the benefit of extended briefing, argument, or deliberation or even a copy of the trial transcript. They could not operate justly absent the opportunity for reconsideration. Second, the Double Jeopardy Clause affords the government a full and fair opportunity to make its case in the first tribunal. In the context of trial, that full and fair opportunity includes reconsideration. Indeed, reconsideration is particularly important precisely because the government very often cannot appeal."

That is -- that is one of the rules the Court follows and it's a general rule, but in important cases, particularly in the qualified immunity context, for example, the Court will -- will sometimes announce the constitutional rule because it's sufficiently important to settle the matter rather than resolving it on statutory grounds or in -- in the context of qualified immunity on reasonableness grounds."

For example, the Court decided a double jeopardy issue in Monge, but that was 4 years after addressing the exact same issue in -- on Teague grounds in an earlier case. And for those 4 years, the lower Federal courts and the courts in the State of California for which it had special applicability suffered through a -- a tremendous amount of uncertainty.

Now, you say the judge can change his mind at any time 'til the end of the line. It seems to me that would be grossly unfair to a defendant."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "For double jeopardy purposes, but not for due process purposes. That would raise a -- raise a -- a serious due -- excuse me -- due process issue. It's the exact same issue that arises, for example, when a trial court dismisses a count of a complaint, which raises no double jeopardy concerns at all and then, very late in the trial, determines that he had erred in dismissing an -- a count of the indictment. When that happens, the ordinary process is either the court must reopen the evidence to permit the defendant to put on the defense that he didn't have the opportunity to present, or the defendant may be entitled to a mistrial. But that is very much a fairness trial, due process issue, not a question of double jeopardy. The third point is that double jeopardy --"

I haven't been talking to the witness in the hall as you thought, or whatever, and then Judge Wyzanski could have, in fact, taken back the -- the judgment of the directed -- directed verdict of acquittal, although this Court later wouldn't have been able to do it in your view."

  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "In our view that's precisely correct, so long as Judge Wyzanski had not discharged the jury because once you discharge the jury, the -- the defendant's right to trial before his tribunal of choice has been eliminated. The -- so long as the jury hasn't been discharged, the trial court has inherent authority to correct its own mistakes. No double jeopardy purpose is served by giving -- by precluding reconsideration to give the defendant the benefit of acquittal to which no court, and certainly not the jury and not the trial court that putatively granted it, believes the defendant is entitled.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "Well, I think it would -- our best case would probably be this Court's statements in Arizona versus Washington, in essence that the government -- although the government often doesn't get an appeal and it doesn't get a second shot at -- bite of the apple, it does get one full and fair opportunity before the trial court. In our view that full and fair opportunity must include reconsideration precisely because trial courts move so swiftly and because the initial decision by a trial court isn't meant to be a final decision but is, in fact, part of the deliberative process, part of the ongoing dialogue in trial among the judge, among a prosecutor and defendant's counsel."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So if you drop the first degree murder charge -- or the judge orders it dismissed and then the defendant testifies thinking, well, at least I'm not going to be tried for first degree, in your view the trial judge can change its ruling and reinstate the first degree murder charges because the defendant shouldn't have relied? He --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "No. The ordinary rule -- and this is the same rule that applies where a court, for example, dismisses a count of the indictment -- is that defendants are entitled to rely on the interlocutory rulings. If they do so to their detriment and to their prejudice and it denies them the opportunity to present their fair defense, that is a significant due process problem and may entitle --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What -- what if you have a series of defendants in a -- in a case and it's being tried, and at the close of the prosecution's evidence, the judge dismisses the indictment as against one of the defendants, but keeps on so the jury is still there? What happens then? Can the -- the prosecution come back a couple days later and say, you made a mistake?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "That's, actually points up a difficult question which is whether or not the dismissal of the -- well, if it's dismissal in the indictment, it certainly isn't a double jeopardy problem, but if it's a judgment of acquittal at that point, the question the court would have to confront --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, say -- change my hypothetical to a judgment of acquittal."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "Right. That's what I assumed you had meant. And if that were the case, the court would have to decide whether or not that there -- there's constructively or through legal fiction the discharge of the jury with respect to that defendant even though the --actual jury is still there"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's an extraordinary doctrine."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "Well, I -- I would believe that the proper answer would be that if the jury is still available, the prosecution can seek reconsideration. But one could say that the jury was constructively discharged with respect to that defendant and thereby preclude the prosecution from seeking reconsideration. But the critical moment in all of those cases is what constitutes discharge of the jury, the defendant's chosen trier of fact."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But getting back to the earlier point, if a -- if the defendant testifies, thinking there's going to be no first degree charge, and it's later reinstated, under your position I think you would say, he shouldn't have relied. The rule is that he knows the  judge can change his mind. Therefore, his reliance was at his peril."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but the hypothetical is there is one."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "Right. And if the defendant relies to his detriment and it prevents him from presenting a fair defense to which due process entitles him, we believe that he might be entitled to a mistrial. But we -- nothing of that sort happened here because defendant not only was on notice that this -- that the ruling was subject to change, but if you look at the point in the joint appendix, which is the penultimate page, where the court announced -- page 46, where the court announces that it has decided to reconsider, there's no objection from the defense saying, wait a minute, we relied. Our whole defense rested on this ruling. There's no statement to that effect."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I suppose parties can -- can  repudiate a contract, can't they, since there's no -- no involuntary servitude? But the mere fact that one party to a contract knows that the other party can repudiate it, does not mean that the repudiation can be cost-free."
  },

    "speaker": "LAMKEN",

    "speech": "The other party is entitled to rely upon the contract despite his knowledge that it can be repudiated."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "LAMKEN",
    "speech": "Right. I -- I think that just points out the general rule, that -- when a trial court issues a mid-trial ruling, the defendant generally has a right to -- to rely on it, and if he relies on it and it denies him his opportunity to present a fair defense, that presents a serious due process problem. But it is not a double jeopardy problem because double jeopardy is concerned with having two trials against the defendant when the prosecution had its full and fair opportunity in the first. The final problem with the contrary rule is that it requires appellate courts to engage in an often unrealistic endeavor to go through and try and determine what the trial court, through its spontaneous and sometimes extemporaneous statements, really meant to do or what it actually did. For example, in this case it seems to come down to the question of whether the words, my impression at this time, is -- suggest sufficient tentativeness and whether the word okay is the functional equivalent of it is so ordered. In addition, under respondent's approach, the trial -- the court of appeals would be required to determine whether the request for reconsideration came promptly enough, whether or not it came in the same breath -- I see I'm out of time. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."

    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: First of all, a brief factual correction. The change in the judge's ruling did not occur before Mr. Vincent testified. The change in the judge's ruling occurred on April 2nd, 1992, 2 days after the ruling had been made after Mr. Vincent had testified. What happened on April 1st, 1992 was the judge indicated that he would reconsider his motion and hold it in abeyance, but he did not, at that time, take back the directed verdict of acquittal."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, he didn't take it back, but he made it clear that he -- he did not consider it -- he did not consider that he had made a final ruling. At least that was clear. It was clear that no final ruling had been made before the testimony occurred."

    "speech": "No. I -- I don't know who -- who -- in whose favor it breaks. I'm just asking what your position on it is, whether -- whether -- because on that -- on that question hinges whether we are dealing here with a question of fact, as we would be in interpreting -- in -- in deciding, you know, what he intended, or a question of law, as we would be in interpreting the words of a contract where indeed it doesn't matter what the parties intended. If they express themselves this way, you -- you take the objective meaning of it. Right? And that's a question of law for the court and not a question of fact for the jury."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, in -- in your position here attacking a State judgment, you don't -- you don't immediately get to the constitutional question. You get to the question of whether the Michigan Supreme Court's ruling was either contrary to our precedents or an unreasonable application of them. In other words, the Michigan Supreme Court could have been wrong as a matter of abstract constitutional law and it could still be upheld here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "Yes. What we attacked in Federal district court on habeas was the Michigan Supreme Court's conclusion that there had never been an acquittal at all, and we persuaded the Federal district judge and the Sixth Circuit that the Michigan Supreme Court's conclusion that there had not been an acquittal was an unreasonable application of this Court's precedents, particularly Ball, Kepner, Green, because the Michigan Supreme Court placed primary emphasis on the absence of formal trappings, and this Court has repeatedly held that even in the absence of any written judgment at all, as in Ball and Kepner, that a final directed -- a verdict of acquittal is final."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It could be, but presumably Michigan knows Michigan law, and if they want to say, under the law of Michigan, the events that took place here do not amount to an acquittal, I guess that's their right. Now, is there anything in the cases that you cite which says that Federal law requires Michigan to count these things as an acquittal?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",

    "speech": "All right. Now, it happens in Michigan they don't do that. In Michigan, they have the Michigan system. Now, what is it that tells Michigan you have to, as a matter of Federal law, count this as an acquittal? I quite agree with you that there are cases where the Court has said this is an acquittal, but I don't think they're faced in those cases with a State court that says the contrary."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "That's right. In this case, however, if you look at the full record, the trial judge himself -- and if we get to the issue of intent, Justice Scalia -- the trial judge himself says over and over, I made a ruling, I came to a conclusion, I made a decision, and even at one point, I granted a motion for a directed verdict.

What -- what the Michigan Supreme Court ruled or stated was they agreed with the Michigan Court of Appeals and the dissenters in the Michigan Supreme Court that characterizing the trial judge's comments as an acquittal would require us to reverse Mr. Vincent's conviction. The Michigan Supreme Court actually said that. So they -- and that was after a discussion of Smalis. Both the Michigan Court of appeals and the Michigan Supreme Court, after reviewing this Court's decision in Smalis, like so many other lower courts, have come to the conclusion that what a trial judge may not do, consistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause, is revisit a directed verdict at any point later in the trial."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why, how? Explain that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "Because the judge announced his ruling. All the parties, including the judge, understood that under Michigan court rules, the judge could not reserve his decision, had to make it. He did so. He announced his decision. He said, okay. Is there anything else?"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "When I read the court rule and then read the Federal rule, the difference in the practice is what they mean by reserve under the Federal rule where you can reserve -- and it happens every day -- is a district judge says, you move at the end of the plaintiff's case. I'm the district judge. I say I'm going to let it go to the jury. If the jury acquits, you're home free. If it convicts, I'll go back to it. That happens all the time. And that, it seems to me, is what the Michigan rule says can't happen in Michigan --"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But surely it can't mean that if a -- if a motion is made at quarter after 4:00 in the afternoon and the court customarily recesses at 4:30, that he can't wait until the next morning, so no testimony being taken in the meantime."

He enters the -- he tells his clerk at 4:30, enter the order dismissing the first degree charge. He then comes back at 8:30 in the morning, after having thought about it overnight. He tells the clerk, put in a new docket entry, order withdrawn, motion to dismiss denied. No one knows about this until quarter to 9:00. Defense doesn't even know about it. What result in that case?"

  },

    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "In the judge's own mind, he didn't acquit. And what you're urging is so different from how we approach trial rulings generally, and the point was made that in a trial, things go fast, judge -- judges make rulings. It's very common, is it not, for a judge to make a ruling and then go home that night, maybe read over the daily transcript, maybe have her law clerk check a few authorities, and say, oh, my goodness, I made a mistake, the next morning. You couldn't run trials -- I mean, the trial judges don't have the luxury that appellate judges do in that regard. They have to make rulings on the spot, and they can revisit them. You -- you are suggesting that this rule, like no other, is -- once the judge utters the words, motion granted, that's the end of it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",

    "speech": "-- saying at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I grant your motion, and then overnight -- and then they come back the next morning and the judge says, I'm not so sure. Prosecutor, tell me more about this. What's the difference of the overnight interval? Nothing has happened. The trial hasn't gone on. No witnesses have appeared."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "But, Your Honor, if that was the law, then Smalis v. Pennsylvania is impossible to understand because in Smalis the prosecution there could have taken some sort of emergency appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme -- Pennsylvania Superior Court, got a ruling late that afternoon, and come back the next morning and resumed the trial. And in fact, the prosecution tried exactly that in a Tenth Circuit case, United States versus Eliason."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I'm sorry. I don't follow you because I thought the judge in Smalis was firm throughout, that he never equivocated about what his ruling was."

    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "Actually the judge in Smalis agreed to a reconsideration motion --"

    "speech": "But then he came up just where he was the first time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "Yes, that's -- that's right. What I'm saying is, is that if double jeopardy doesn't protect -- if there's no double jeopardy violation, if it can be revisited quickly, then Smalis is impossible to understand because Smalis then would simply come down to if you can do it quickly, if you can get an appeal to a higher court and a reversal quickly --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, being -- being revisited on appeal is different from being revisited at the trial by the trial judge. That's -- that's the distinction that's being drawn by your opponent here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "Yes, Justice Scalia. And -- and the point of that argument is that it makes it completely dispositive as to whether there are other defendants remaining, as I believe Mr. Chief Justice --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You don't have to go that far at all. I mean, Smalis is not a case where the judge changed his mind, I take it. And this is a case where the judge changed his mind."

I'm right about that."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "I agree. But if you look at the trial judge's comments, he consistently maintains that he -- he made a ruling. And ruling is actually the exact word from Martin Linen, that this Court has to decide whether or not the trial judge made a ruling."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Moran, I'd like to get back to an AEDPA question, and that is, as I understand it, there is a division among lower courts on just how much leeway a trial judge has to take back a directed verdict. And if there is disarray in the lower courts, how can we say there's clearly established law in your favor?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "Because what -- what AEDPA requires is not to look at the decisions of the lower courts, but to look to see whether the decision of the Michigan Supreme Court was a clearly unreasonable application. Now, I should point out, first of all, on that issue whether a judge can take back a directed verdict, the Michigan Supreme Court did not rule against us, in fact indicated that it agreed with our position that a judge may not take back a directed verdict if he had -- if he has actually rendered one. And the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled the same way. But if you look at the split of authority, it's a very striking split of authority. The cases that cite and rely upon Smalis on very similar situations where there is a directed verdict, a partial directed verdict during an ongoing trial, so the trial continues, and then the judge attempts to take back the directed verdict at some point later in the trial, those courts that have applied Smalis have, with one exception, held that the judge cannot do it. Those courts that have gone the other way have almost uniformly relied on a Second Circuit decision, United States versus LoRusso, which says that there is no problem with doing that because it does not result in a second trial. And what this Court could not have been more clear about in Smalis is that a double jeopardy is violated not only if a reversal of a directed verdict would result in a second trial, but if it would result in a continuation of the same trial. And that is why this case is constitutionally indistinguishable from Smalis. The only difference between this case and Smalis is that instead of going to a higher court, as was attempted by -- in the Tenth Circuit in United States versus Ellison, what happened there is that the prosecution -- there was a partial directed verdict, exactly as in this case. The prosecution ran across --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But you -- that's assuming the -- assuming the whole factual point at issue here, that there was a partial directed verdict."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And in Smalis, there was no doubt about that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "Well, there was doubt as to what the judge had done. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court said it wasn't a directed verdict because it was a legal ruling and not a -- not --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but that -- that was a very theoretical thing, whether as a matter of -- when you're saying there's no evidence as a matter of law, that's a factual ruling or a legal ruling."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I -- I don't think that bears on our case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "No, and that is -- and that is a distinction. That's why we have an issue one, Mr. Chief Justice, is -- is, of course, we have to get past the issue of was there a directed verdict. Then we get to issue two. If there was a directed verdict, can the judge take it back? And that is where I maintain that this case is constitutionally indistinguishable from Smalis. On -- on issue one, I -- I just wanted to make a further point about whether this is fact finding or a legal finding. The Michigan Supreme Court itself did not regard what it was doing as fact finding. There was not the slightest indication in the Michigan Supreme Court's opinion that it thought it was engaged in fact finding. Nor did this Court think that it was engaged in fact finding in several cases in which this Court has examined arguably ambiguous district court transcripts to determine whether or not an acquittal had been granted, for example, Scott and even more clearly, Sanabria. In Sanabria, this Court had to wade through a difficult record to determine whether or not the district court had, in fact, granted a directed verdict on both theories, numbers theory and horse betting theory."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, let me follow up on an earlier question of Justice Breyer's. Do you think that if this is true under the Federal system that it was a directed verdict, it must therefore be true under the -- under an -- under any State system?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "Yes. I believe that follows immediately, well, first of all, from Maryland v. Benton which applies Double Jeopardy Clause to the States, but also from Crist --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but the fact that -- that that case applies double jeopardy to the States I don't think necessarily settles whether a particular State procedure is or is not a directed verdict."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "No. But it also follows from Crist v. Bretz in which this Court rejected a -- Montana's attempt to declare that jeopardy doesn't attach until the first witness is sworn in a jury trial. And this Court said, no. Where -- where jeopardy attaches and terminates is a matter of Federal constitutional law, and it concluded, therefore, that Montana must follow the Federal rule to that point which is that jeopardy attaches when the jury is sworn. And so this Court has consistently applied the same principles about jeopardy-attaching and jeopardy-terminating events whether the cases arise in State or Federal court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, so the Federal rule is that it attaches when there's been a directed verdict, but it's up to State law when -- when there's been a directed verdict. I mean --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I find that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- there's nothing incompatible there."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "Justice Scalia, I find that hard to square with Martin Linen which teaches us that what a reviewing court must do is putting aside form, looking at substance to decide whether the trial court has found an essential element of the offense is missing. And here, the trial judge clearly stated that there is no premeditation been shown, that therefore second degree murder is the appropriate charge, that a docket entry that could not have been more clear was made to that effect on that day, March 31st, 1992, and then followed by at least five statements by the trial judge over the next 2 days explaining that he had made a ruling, that he had directed a verdict, come to a conclusion and made a decision --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "He kept saying I didn't direct a verdict. He was distinguishing as between granting a motion. He says, I granted a motion, but I didn't direct a verdict."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "MORAN",
    "speech": "Excuse me, Justice Ginsburg. You're quite correct. He said, I granted a motion. I didn't direct a verdict. And his distinction was clearly one of law. He clearly believed that so long as the jury was not told, there was a distinction between granting a motion and directing a verdict. And that position is untenable after Sanabria versus United States and also Martin Linen where the -- the United States made the same argument in Martin Linen, that as long as it's the judge after the hung jury declaring a -- an acquittal, if it doesn't involve the jury in some way, it doesn't count. The same argument was apparently made in Sanabria and dismissed in a footnote that it was so obviously -- so obviously contrary to Martin Linen. And so the judge never said as a fact -- as a fact -- I did not find absence of premeditation. He clearly found absence of premeditation, consistently admitted that that's what he had done, but simply believed, as a matter of double jeopardy law, wrong as a matter of double jeopardy law, that he could take back that decision. The Michigan Supreme Court's conclusion was contrary even under the criteria that the Michigan Supreme Court adopted, wanting to see certain formalities before they would conclude that a acquittal has been granted. That standard was met here. The Michigan Supreme Court itself acknowledged that a docket entry is exactly the sort of formality that they were looking for but then inexplicably failed to notice that there had been such a docket entry made in this case. Not inexplicably the State failed to include the docket entry in its appendix in violation of the Michigan court rules. That's why the Michigan Supreme Court was apparently unaware of the dispositive docket entry."

In fact, the Michigan Supreme Court stated in its opinion at footnote 4 -- it made reference to the fact that it was actually not reaching the conclusion. It wasn't reaching a decision as to whether the judge could change his mind. The respondent's position essentially requires the people to forfeit the second prong of AEDPA. Even if the Court was wrong on its factual finding or unreasonable, the result of this case must be viewed within the filter of that statute which says that the law that they applied was reasonable. There are -- he has cited several cases and we have several cases in the other direction, interestingly enough, including one, United States versus Baggett, which comes out of the Sixth Circuit itself, which says -- in that case there were -- three times the judge announced a ruling and then agreed to hold it in abeyance. In -- in that case the Court said that -- that -- the appeal court said that they were free to change their mind -- the judge was free to change their mind any time prior to the entry of judgment.
