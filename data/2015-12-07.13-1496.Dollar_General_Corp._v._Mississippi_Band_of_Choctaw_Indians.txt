5 Corporation v. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians.

6             Mr. Goldstein.

7           ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

8               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it

10 please the Court:

11             Our narrowest argument assumes that, in

12 circumstances like this case, Indian tribes do have the

13 legislative jurisdiction to subject nonmembers to tribal

14 tort law duties.

15             Respondents argue that the same facts also

16 give Indian tribes the mandatory adjudicatory

17 jurisdiction to decide private tort lawsuits against

18 nonIndians.  Respondents' theory is that, when the

19 Tribes entered the United States and were incorporated

20 into this country, their power to adjudicate cases in

21 this fashion was understood to be an element of their

22 sovereignty.  That is not correct.

23             In  I want to identify the three separate

24 respects in which the overriding sovereignty of the

25 United States and our Constitution 

Alderson Reporting Company

1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could you  could you

4

2 please explain your opening statement?  You  you say

3 there is legislative authority but not judicial

4 authority.  I don't know of any other instance in which

5 a jurisdiction has authority to legislate, to regulate

6 the conduct in question, but does not have authority to

7 back up that legislative authority by adjudicatory

8 authority.

9             Can you give me an example of 

10             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I can give you several,

11 Justice Ginsburg.

12             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.

13             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The first is removal.

14 Remember, our point is not that the Tribes lack any

15 adjudicatory jurisdiction.  It is that they lack

16 mandatory adjudicatory jurisdiction so that we do not

17 have access to a neutral judicial forum.  A State has

18 the power to pass State tort law, for example, but it

19 does not have the sovereign authority to insist that the

20 case be litigated in its own courts.

21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It has the authority,

22 but  but an outofState defendant can be moved to

23 Federal court, but it has the adjudicatory authority.

24             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Ginsburg, everyone

25 agrees that the Tribes have a form of adjudicatory

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
5 1 authority upon consent.  They don't have it inherently. 2 The question is going to be:  What qualifies as consent? 3             Our point is that, in three separate 4 respects, the national tradition of the United States 5 and our Constitution does not contemplate that a 6 sovereign would adjudicate cases in this fashion.  And I 7 want to briefly identify the three, if I could. 8             First, the Constitution contemplates the 9 availability of a neutral forum for suits against 10 noncitizens, and by analogy, noncitizens as you say, 11 Justice Ginsburg, have always been able to remove a case 12 from State to Federal court. 13             The United States at the time of 14 incorporation could not have accepted that nonIndians 15 would not be able to remove to a neutral forum. 16             Second, the Constitution contemplates that 17 this Court will be the one Supreme Court, and State 18 court rulings on questions of Federal law have, of 19 course, always been reviewable in this Court. 20             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I  I don't  this 21 is an important part of the dialogue, but let me just go 22 back to the first part of  of  of your response. 23             Is  is it blackletter law given the 24 Tribes have complete legislative authority over 25 nonTribe members on  for  for regulatory purposes?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 I  I  I take it that as a blackletter law given?

6

2             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Kennedy, if we say

3 it  in those terms, regulatory authority without

4 getting into the question of all forms of legislation,

5 for example, tort law, then the first exception to

6 Montana says that, although there is a presumption

7 against jurisdiction, the Tribes do have their

8 regulatory authority.

9             We have the argument that tort law, because

10 it is so broad and would swallow the rule, that the

11 Tribes lack legislative authority over nonmembers.  We

12 have the argument that that is not within the

13 legislative jurisdiction.

14             What I had said at the beginning 

15             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But doesn't that clash

16 with what the Court said in Strate?  I mean, Strate 

17 I'll read you the sentence.  It says, "It's an

18 unremarkable proposition that where tribes possess

19 authority to regulate the activity of nonmembers, civil

20 jurisdiction over disputes arising out of such

21 activities presumptively lies in tribal courts."

22             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Justice Ginsburg, I

23 need to just separate two questions:

24             Justice Kennedy I understood to be asking me

25 was:  Do the Tribes have the antecedent legislative

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 authority?  And I was explaining that we have the

7

2 argument that in the tort context they do not.

3             You then point out that if 

4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If this is a tort case.

5 It was a 

6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So then I don't understand

7 why you opened your  your  are  I  I thought you

8 said 

9             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We assumed.

10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   I  I  you

11 assumed 

12             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  We 

13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   that this could be 

14 well, I 

15             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Justice 

16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   I don't know why you

17 make that assumption.

18             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I  I  I just 

20             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I apologize.

21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   can't get off square

22 one.

23             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.

24             I do not intend, Justice Kennedy, to give up

25 a good argument in our favor.  I was just attempting to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 identify the narrowest ground for reversal.

8

2             I'm very pleased to discuss the threshold

3 point, and that is that, with respect to nonmembers, the

4 Tribes do not have the authority to subject us to such

5 sweeping tort law duties.  It's not that there aren't

6 tort law duties.  The plaintiff here is a citizen of the

7 State of Mississippi.  Mississippi's tort  State tort

8 law does apply to the case.  And the plaintiff has a

9 remedy in State court.

10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But will you then go back

11 to my question 

12             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.

13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   about Strate?  Because

14 if what you're arguing now is correct, Strate would have

15 been a oneline decision:  No tort jurisdiction over a

16 nonIndian.

17             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's

18 true that this Court's decisions can often be resolved

19 in different ways.  What Nevada v. Hicks in the footnote

20 addressing this question explains is that what the Court

21 has done is narrowly identify the legislative

22 jurisdiction of the Tribe in the cases before it.  And

23 so in Strate and in other cases, it has held that the

24 Tribe lacked that antecedent legislative authority.  And

25 on that basis, concluded that, well, then because the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 adjudicatory authority can't be broader than the

9

2 legislative authority, there's no adjudicatory authority

3 either.

4             So the second point that I was going to make

5 is that it's true that 

6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But are  are you saying

7 then this sentence that I just read to you from the

8 opinion of the Court was just wrong?

9             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Ginsburg, what the

10 Court has said in Nevada v. Hicks, addressing the

11 various times that there is dictum in the Court's

12 opinions that has assumed the parallel between

13 legislative and adjudicatory jurisdiction is that that

14 question had not been fully considered by the Court and

15 it remained open.  And we assume that that's one of the

16 reasons the Court granted review in this case.  To

17 decide, assuming that there is legislative jurisdiction,

18 whether there also is adjudicatory jurisdiction.

19             And I'm pleased to explain why it is.  And

20 what I  my introduction was trying to do was, assuming

21 the antecedent legislative jurisdiction, here's why you

22 don't have jurisdiction to decide a court case in this

23 fashion.

24             So the first one that I gave you was the

25 availability of a neutral forum as anticipated by the

Alderson Reporting Company

1 Constitution.

Official

10

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I address that for a

3 moment?

4             States appoint judges.  Sometimes they're

5 elected, but often they're appointed.  We don't think it

6 lacks being a neutral forum because the State can sue a

7 citizen there.  We think of it as neutral because the

8 judges are neutral.

9             You're just assuming that these judges are

10 not neutral.

11             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Oh, Justice Sotomayor, I

12 think actually that your hypothetical is a good one for

13 us.

14             In Article III of the Constitution, we

15 contemplate the availability of a neutral forum when a

16 noncitizen is a defendant in the case, including when

17 we, you know, ordinarily respect the neutrality of State

18 court judges.  Right?  If a noncitizen is sued in State

19 court, like we are a noncitizen of the Tribe, is sued in

20 the Tribe 

21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's out of comity

22 or our sense of comity between the States.  But it

23 doesn't have anything to do with the fairness of a

24 judicial forum.

25             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Oh, I  I just simply

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1 disagree, Your Honor.  My understanding of the premise 2 of removal jurisdiction is that there was a concern or 3 at least a belief that respect for rule of law is 4 enhanced by the availability of a neutral forum. 5             But I did want  6             JUSTICE BREYER:  What's wrong with the 7 tribal courts? 8             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  What's wrong with the tribal 9 courts?  It depends. 10             First of all, let me say that there are 11 modern tribal judiciaries like this one that deserve 12 genuine respect.  That are  have developed real 13 principles in attempt to identify law that can be known 14 ex ante and the availability of a neutral forum. 15             There are, however, many tribes, everyone 16 agrees, that don't have anything like that.  They 17 instead deserve respect in a different  18             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Fine.  So  so 19 we've seen lots of tribal courts, which I can't 20 distinguish them in the fairness and procedure and so 21 forth from every other court in the country, and maybe 22 there's some where that isn't true. 23             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right. 24             JUSTICE BREYER:  So what  what you do is 25 you go and complain, we didn't get due process of law.

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  If you're in one of the

3 ones that has some unusual thing about it.

4             But if you're in a normal thing, you say,

5 it's normal.

6             So what's wrong with saying just that?

7             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.

8             JUSTICE BREYER:  Like a State court which

9 has terrible procedures, terribly unfair, or a foreign

10 court.  You complain you didn't get proper process.

11             But that has nothing to do with this case.

12             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  All right.  I 

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  Or little.

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You  you can remove from

15 State court, can't you?

16             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  That's right.

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And when  and  and when

18 removal is asked for, we don't ask the question, what's

19 the matter with State courts?  Do we?

20             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's right.  Our

21 Constitution 

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  We  we just say that the

23 Constitution says you have a  a choice of having your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
13 1 not going to lose sight of your question, but just on 2 this point, our Constitution says we anticipate a 3 neutral forum that this Court will  the Supreme 4 Court  5             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, the Constitution 6 says the removal of statute is a statute.  It's not 7 constitutional. 8             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Ginsburg, I 9 understand that.  My  what  and, Justice Breyer, I'm 10 not losing sight of your question  what the  what 11 Oliphant and other precedents of this Court say is that 12 the Tribes have the sovereign authority that is 13 consistent with the overriding sovereignty of the United 14 States.  And the point I was trying to make is that our 15 legal tradition understands that there will be certain 16 basic protections. 17             And remember, two of the things I'm 18 identifying in the Constitution are not specific to the 19 States:  The supremacy of the Constitution  but the 20 Constitution does not apply in tribal courts  and also 21 the supremacy of this Court as the one Supreme Court, 22 which is not available. 23             Now, Justice Scalia, those are features of 24 our national legal tradition, and those features existed 25 at the time of incorporation of the Tribes into the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1 United States.  And my point is that Congress could not 2 have believed that, if State courts couldn't do these 3 things, that the tribal courts would be superior. 4             Now, Justice Breyer, you said, well, what's 5 wrong?  Two things.  I want to say that there are some 6 things wrong even in the context of a tribe like this 7 one. 8             For example, we have a Federal claim against 9 the due process  a due process claim against the 10 putative damage award in  that's asked for in this 11 case, and that would be entirely unreviewable in this 12 case. 13             Now, you contemplate the prospect that we 14 would collaterally attack the judgment.  A few things 15 about that. 16             The first is, if that's going to be serious, 17 if we are really going to have a serious regime of 18 collateral attacks where you would just assess whether 19 or not the tribal court ruling is consistent with due 20 process.  That is hardly treating the tribal courts as 21 sovereigns.  Imagine a Federal district court ruling 22 could be overturned by a circuit court in Mississippi. 23 We wouldn't say that that was an actual sovereign 24 ruling. 25             And the second is that that review system is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
15 1 extremely rare.  The Respondents identify a single case, 2 one Ninth Circuit case in which a tribal ruling was 3 overturned. 4             What the Federal courts have done is afford 5 enormous respect and only overturned rulings of tribal 6 courts or foreign courts that are way out of bounds.  My 7 point is that the rule that's contemplated by the 8 Constitution is not one of being way out of bounds, it 9 is simply that we have a right to due process; that this 10 Court will be the Supreme Court, that the Constitution 11 is the supreme law of the land.  And when that is not 12 true in the courts that we are talking about, even the 13 bestmanaged, most modern courts, when those rules 14 simply don't apply, that is not consistent  15             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But doesn't the Indian 16 Civil Rights Act  I mean, it's not the Bill of Rights, 17 but Indian Civil Rights Act is pretty close. 18             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, the 19 rule of the Constitution is not "close is good enough," 20 but I will say that I think the Indian Civil Rights Act 21 is a point in our favor.  Because when you talk about 22 the regulatory matters discussed in the first Montana 23 exception like taxation and licensing, those are things 24 that Congress has left to the Tribes.  But the Indian 25 Civil Rights Act, like Public Law 280, like the Courts
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
16 1 of Indian Offenses, like the Indian deprivation system 2 shows that the United States has actually been deeply 3 involved in the tribal judiciary.  It has not treated 4 tribal adjudication of civil claims as something that 5 belongs to the Tribes.  It's quite different. 6             The United States obviously did not regard 7 the Tribes' judiciary as something that is purely a part 8 of their government, because time and again, it has 9 micromanaged them. 10             And, Justice Breyer, I do want to point out 11 another example of that, and that is the Violence 12 Against Women Act.  There, we see the right way of doing 13 this, and that Congress has developed systems that say 14 if this tribal judiciary is a good one which affords due 15 process, then it has jurisdiction over cases. 16             And we think that's the right approach here. 17 Congress has the institutional capacity to develop rules 18 like the one you were talking about.  It's a much 19 more  20             JUSTICE BREYER:  You can do it both ways. 21 And there are books, some of which I have at least 22 looked through, and certainly articles that suggest that 23 the tribal courts function perfectly well, certainly in 24 many places. 25             Now, I take it your argument is that there
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
17 1 are some places they don't function well, and in respect 2 to matters that are not matters of Federal law, there 3 won't be review from those courts unless you 4 collaterally attack them.  Is that your point? 5             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Breyer, as I 6 mentioned, we have real concerns, even with respect to a 7 system like this one.  For just an example  8             JUSTICE BREYER:  I just want to know, have I 9 got your point right? 10             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, I  our point is 11 broader.  You had suggested, Justice Breyer, that I was 12 concerned about another set of tribal judiciaries.  I 13 just don't want to lose sight of the fact that there are 14 concerns, even when you have the most modern tribal 15 judiciary. 16             An example is that the  we are a 17 noncitizen, a nonmember of the Tribe, and the tribal 18 jury may be composed only of members of the Tribe, and 19 there's no inherent rule that stops the jury members 20 from being people who know the plaintiff. 21             Now with respect to other judiciaries, it is 22 the case that we do recognize, and the United States has 23 recognized, a wide swath of tribes that use more 24 traditional disputeresolution mechanisms that also 25 deserve respect because that's the tribal tradition.
Alderson Reporting Company

1 But it is not the tradition of due process.

18

2             And the question you've got to figure 

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  The nontribal member goes

4 to the tribal land and signs an agreement that says

5 tribal law would apply, and then commits a tort on the

6 tribal lands, and even under those circumstances, and

7 even if the court is functioning well, the tribal court

8 cannot take jurisdiction over his claim.  That's your

9 position.  And then to that I say, if I haven't got it

10 already, why not?

11             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Justice Breyer, I do

12 think your hypothetical of a contract is a really good

13 one for us, because we do believe that the Respondents

14 are most concerned, and their best facts are a business

15 like this one, to be honest, that's operating on tribal

16 land, in the Reservation on an ongoing basis, and they

17 say, look, you have to have anticipated the

18 applicability of tribal tort law.  We disagree, but we

19 understand the argument.

20             My point is that in these circumstances,

21 what the Tribes do is, as a condition of operating on

22 the Reservation, they call for not just what you

23 describe, which is the application of tribal law, but a

24 consent to the forum.  And remember, in this case, there

25 is a consent to the forum, but the  which the Tribe

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
19 1 wrote, but they limited it to disputes arising from the 2 lease. 3             So we say, going forward, we have two 4 solutions.  One I've described:  That's the prospect of 5 congressional action.  You say it could work the other 6 way, and I'll come back to that. 7             But the second is just the contract. 8 Obviously, in the cases that they are concerned about, 9 what the tribe can do and will do is require as a 10 condition of coming onto the Reservation that you 11 accede, knowingly and actually, to the jurisdiction of 12 the tribal courts, and  13             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Goldstein, you 14 could have done that, too.  The contract can go either 15 way.  The question is what's the default rule when the 16 contract doesn't say anything. 17             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Actually, it wouldn't work 18 the other way, Justice Kagan, with all due respect. 19 Remember, this is a private tort suit by a member of the 20 Tribe. 21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but remember, this is  22 there's  this is an exception for consent.  The  the 23 company would have  the store would have an extremely 24 good argument that it didn't consent if it had signed a 25 contract with anybody, with the Tribe, not just with the

Official
20 1 individual person.  If it had signed a contract with the 2 Tribe, saying we insist on a State forum, they clearly 3 haven't consented. 4             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Justice Kagan, I just 5 don't understand how it is the case  I disagree, let 6 me just explain why.  I understand that you take the  7 you have the opposite view. 8             If a private person sues us, the fact that 9 we have a contract with that  that individual State 10 government does not strip a State court of jurisdiction 11 over their private suit.  So that's our view of it. 12 But  13             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it does when the 14 Montana exception relies upon a consensual relationship. 15             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  But Justice Kagan, for the 16 other side to win, what they have  their premise is 17 that the consensual relationship exists in simply the 18 activity with the individual tribal member, not the 19 contract.  Remember, their point is that a contract is 20 irrelevant.  So the consent would exist simply by 21 operating the business. 22             But in all events, it is the case that we 23 could insist on a contract; they can insist on a 24 contract.  My point to Justice Breyer was simply that 25 the upshot of our position still leaves enormous room

21 1 for the exercise of tribal sovereignty.  They do have 2 this power.  Remember that the data before you from the 3 United States indicates that this is a very small 4 proportion of cases that the tribal courts adjudicate. 5 The data from this Tribe indicates that it's 1 percent 6 of cases. 7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  All of these arguments, your 8 arguments  let me figure out whether this is right. 9 Your arguments about it's  it's a nonneutral forum, 10 it's an unfair forum, we don't know whether they have 11 the same procedures that  that are commonly  that 12 commonly exist in Federal and State courts.  Those 13 arguments have nothing to do with tort claims versus 14 other claims; is that right? 15             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  They do have a lot to do 16 with the fact that it's a private claim.  Let me 17 distinguish, importantly, actions by the Tribe itself. 18             And the analogy here is that when a State 19 sues a noncitizen, that is an act of the sovereign and 20 it is not removable, because what Montana is concerned 21 with, what this Court's precedents are concerned with, 22 is the exercise of sovereign authority in the pursuit of 23 selfgovernance. 24             This is not a sovereign action.  This is a 25 private suit between two individuals, and so it is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 important that if the Tribe is exercising its sovereign 2 authority, bringing a civil enforcement action against 3 us, for example, that would have presented  present a 4 very different question, because it would be 5 sovereignty.  It has never been understood that  6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So if the Tribe brought 7 this suit, instead of the parents of the boy who was 8 molested, if  if it  then it would be okay? 9             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, we think that's an 10 impossibility.  Remember that the other side's 11 explanation  although there aren't any citations; it's 12 hard to know what the tort law is  the other side's 13 explanation is that tort law of the Tribe tracks 14 Mississippi tort law, and there isn't a situation in 15 which the Tribe could bring such an action.  And I think 16 if it was a parens patriae action, we would still regard 17 it as in the interest of the individual. 18             I'm thinking instead, Justice Ginsburg, of 19 take the followon to what Montana describes, that is, a 20 licensing regulation or a taxation regulation.  We 21 believe that if the Tribe went into tribal court to 22 enforce those measures, that would be a sovereign action 23 and it would be susceptible of the Montana exception. 24             The difference is when the Tribe is not a 25 party here.  We don't deny that there is some sovereign

Official
23 1 interest.  Okay.  There is some sovereign interest in 2 this adjudication. 3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's a bit of an odd 4 argument, isn't it, Mr. Goldstein, that there's less of 5 a sovereign interest in protecting your own citizens 6 than in enforcing your licensing laws? 7             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  If that were our argument, 8 it would be an odd one.  What we say is that you have a 9 very different regime.  If you have a legal regime that 10 said here is a duty towards our noncitizen, our  our 11 tribal members or just individuals on the Reservation, 12 and if you violate that, here are a set of fines, you 13 will be excluded from the Reservation, then that would 14 be an act of the sovereign. 15             So our point isn't just it's the nature of 16 this  you know, this is a very serious allegation that 17 we take very seriously about a minor child, a member of 18 the Tribe.  I am not demeaning that in any way and 19 saying, well, that's less important than taxation or a 20 hunting license.  Not at all. 21             My point is that you are being asked that at 22 the time the Tribes came into the United States, was a 23 private suit against a nonmember regarded as an 24 incidence of sovereignty, could the Congress of the 25 United States, when the States didn't have this
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
24 1 authority, when the Constitution didn't contemplate they 2 would, have really believed that the Tribes could? 3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your  your  your brief 4 consistently, let me say, suggests  5             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   that Congress could 7 authorize this jurisdiction. 8             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could Congress pass a law 10 saying that all 500plus Indian Tribes in the 11 United States have unlimited criminal authority, could 12 impose life sentences on nontribal members, American 13 citizens? 14             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We think not, and let me 15 explain the reason.  That would be State action.  You 16 know, the Federal government would be passing a law 17 essentially shunting the jurisdiction over an 18 individual's matter into another adjudicative system. 19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, why can they do  20 if  if there's a limit on that, why isn't is there a 21 limit on what Congress could do with reference to tort 22 law?  Because you get unlimited power  500 tribes have 23 unlimited power to impose punitive damages for civil 24 torts if it happens within the boundaries of the 25 Reservation.

25 1             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Kennedy, if I have 2 suggested that Congress could do that, I apologize.  It 3 wasn't my intention. 4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My question is:  What are 5 the limits? 6             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The limits are due process, 7 and that is that if you  and the reason that due 8 process applies here is that the tribe of judgment  9 we've switched to the civil context now in your newest 10 hypothetical. 11             If the Tribe's judgment would presumably be 12 enforceable in the courts of the United States or of a 13 State, there would be State action then, and it would 14 violate the principle of due process. 15             It also  16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My  my hypothetical is 17 that the Congress gives Indian powers  Indian tribes 18 complete powers, both civil and criminal, over all 19 persons on tribal Reservations.  No Federal review, 20 nothing. 21             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's unconstitutional 22 because Congress is subject to the Constitution.  It 23 would violate the Supremacy Clause; it would violate 24 Article III, which contemplate  sorry. 25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then why  why doesn't

GOLDSTEIN:  I'm sorry. 7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   the Montana First 8 exception.  We could say the Montana First exception 9 doesn't apply to this case. 10             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We do  okay.  Justice 11 Kennedy, we do make the argument you're describing.  I 12 apologize.  I misunderstood your point.  It's my fault. 13             We say that there is a significant 14 constitutional avoidance argument  that's how we 15 describe it  in concluding to  for concluding that 16 Montana does not apply here because of the very serious 17 prospects that there would be a loss of property without 18 due process of laws because the tribes would have just 19 what you've described. 20             This plaintiff has sued us for multiple 21 millions of dollars in punitive damages.  We do not have 22 the guarantees provided by the Constitution, and we do 23 not have review in this Court. 24             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if the  Congress 25 of the United States give the UN authority

5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   just so long as it says

6 there has to be due process, they're not a

7 constitutional entity?

8             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's the second point I

9 made, Justice Kennedy.  We have the procedural due

10 process question, but also the Article III question, and

11 that is this is the Supreme Court of the land.

12             The Supremacy Clause says that the

13 Constitution will be the supreme law throughout the

14 land, and Congress could not take cases in the

15 United States and assign them to the UN or the Triple A

16 or anybody else.  We absolutely agree with that.

17             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what civil  what

18 civil cases can be brought?  What  let's assume that

19 the incident occurs on the Reservation, and the

20 wrongdoer is not a member of the Tribe.  What civil

21 claims can be brought against nonmembers in tribal

22 court?

23             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The following.  The first is

24  and this case is an illustration of it  those

25 claims that are subject to the contract that allow the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 individual or the business to come on to the

28

2 Reservation.  We acceded, quite expressly, to

3 jurisdiction over disputes arising from the lease.

4             The second is when the Tribe itself, in the

5 exercise of its sovereign authority, brings the action,

6 so long as it's consistent with principles of due

7 process, we think that would be much more consistent

8 with Montana 

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  For example?  What would

10 fit into that category?

11             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The examples that I gave

12 before are that enforcing a taxation rule, enforcing a

13 licensing rule.  Also importantly, the Tribe has the

14 selfhelp remedy of exclusion from the Reservation.

15             If I could reserve the balance of my time.

22             The facts of this tragic case place it

23 squarely in the heartland of the sovereign tribal

29 1 land with a lease and license from a tribe and agreed to 2 participate in a tribal internship program.

We have never before recognized Indian 10 court  court jurisdiction over a nonmember, have we? 11             MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think that you haven't 12 applied the rule.  But as Justice Ginsburg was saying, 13 this Court unanimously, in Strate, said that when tribes 14 possess authority to regulate activities of nonmembers, 15 civil jurisdiction over disputes  16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  Right.  But 17 I guess I want to make sure I understand what's at issue 18 here. 19             There has never been a case in which a 20 nonmember has been haled into Indian tribal court for  21 on the basis of tort, has there? 22             MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think that there have 23 been many cases, Your Honor.  Four of them have come 24 before this Court in which they have been haled before. 25 So Strate is an example.  Iowa Mutual is an example.

3             MR. KATYAL:  So this Court decided those

4 questions on antecedent grounds 

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess I don't know

6 that we need to  there has never been a case where a

7 nonmember has been held liable in tort in an Indian 

8 Indian court.

9             MR. KATYAL:  Mr. Chief Justice, that's

10 exactly right in terms of describing 

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think it's a

12 little odd to say this is in the heartland of Indian

13 jurisdiction.

14             MR. KATYAL:  I don't think it's odd at all.

15 That's the rule that this Court laid down.  That's the

16 language in Strate.  And my friend, Mr. Goldstein's,

17 best argument on the other side is your language in 

18 this Court's language in 

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's dictum.  Dictum is

20 dictum.  Dictum doesn't make something a heartland.

21             MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think that 

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Cases make it.  Judgments

23 make it heartland.

24             MR. KATYAL:  Well, Justice  Justice

25 Scalia, I think everything about this Court's precedents

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 in this area, which are all tort cases, lead to that

31

2 conclusion.

3             Mr. Goldstein's best argument is Hicks.  But

4 remember in Hicks, the Court went out of its way to say

5 that the claims in El Paso, which were very similar to

6 the claims here  it was a nonmember business doing

7 business on tribal land.  It was a tort lawsuit  what

8 did this Court say, citing to footnote 4 of El Paso?

9 There is little doubt there was jurisdiction in that

10 case.

11             So yes, I understand that they are dicta,

12 but it is dicta of the most persuasive sort.  It is the

13 unbroken rule of this Court, frankly, that in all of

14 these cases, this Court has said there is presumptively

15 jurisdiction.

16             And indeed, the exhaustion cases would make

17 no sense otherwise because twice this Court said, in

18 tort cases, in Iowa Mutual and National Farmers Union,

19 this Court said you've got to go to tribal court and

20 exhaust your remedies.

21             And Justice Scalia, if the rule in those

22 cases was, hey, tribal courts don't have jurisdiction,

23 they would have done what you did in your opinion in

24 Hicks, because at page 369 you said, quote, "Since it's

25 clear tribal courts lack jurisdiction over State

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 officials, adherence to the tribal exhaustion

32

2 requirement would serve no purpose."

3             JUSTICE ALITO:  Does your argument apply

4 whenever a nonmember enters into a commercial

5 transaction with a member?

6             MR. KATYAL:  No, it doesn't apply 

7             JUSTICE ALITO:  On tribal land?

8             MR. KATYAL:  Well, on tribal land we do

9 think  we don't think you have to go as far as the

10 Solicitor General to say it's absolutely 100 percent

11 dispositive, but we do think this Court has recognized

12 in Merrion and El Paso that when you're on tribal lands,

13 the tribe's powers are at their zenith.

14             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I'm trying to

15 understand the limits of your  of your argument.

16             So what would happen in this situation?  A

17 tribe  a member of the Tribe purchases a product

18 online from a nonmember company, and the product is

19 delivered to the Tribal member on tribal land.  The

20 delivery person gets involved in a traffic accident or

21 some other dispute in the course of delivering the

22 product, and the product itself injures the person who

23 purchased it.

24             So could the  the person who got into 

25 who was in the accident with the delivery person sue in

Alderson Reporting Company

1 tribal courts?

Official

33

2             Could the person who  the tribal member

3 who purchased the product bring a products liability

4 action against the manufacturer in tribal court?

5             MR. KATYAL:  It depends a little bit more on

6 the facts.  In general, what this Court has said is that

7 you need a consensual relationship with someone on the

8 Tribe  on tribal land.  And so, you know, to the

9 extent that that delivery service was operated by, you

10 know, by the nonmember and that they're actually doing

11 the delivery, absolutely.  There's a nexus between the

12 delivery and the injury.

13             Now, if it was some exotic tort, so for

14 example it's the delivery truck comes onto tribal land,

15 and unbeknownst to them there's some unusual tradition

16 that says delivery trucks have to be painted, you know,

17 some other color or something like that that they don't

18 know about, I think this Court's decision in Plains

19 Commerce Bank says that's not what you're reasonably

20 anticipating.

21             So this is a very limited rule, really

22 tailored  it's circumstances like this in which

23 every  the law of every jurisdiction 

24             JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  What about the

25  what about the products liability action?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
34 1             MR. KATYAL:  So again, if  if a business 2 is sending  intentionally, knowingly sending goods 3 onto tribal land, and those turn out to be defective, 4 then they're liable for that, for that tort.  That is 5 something that's a reasonably  reasonably to be 6 anticipated  7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that could be for 8 punitive damages, millions of dollars? 9             MR. KATYAL:  If  if that's what they have 10 consented to.  So for  11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No.  No.  There's no 12 consent.  It's just what Justice Alito said, that they 13 send their products to 50 different States  14             MR. KATYAL:  If  if there's  15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   and all of the tribes. 16             MR. KATYAL:  If  if they do so knowingly, 17 and there is that kind of longterm relationship, then 18 yes, unless they themselves disclaim that  and of 19 course it's very easy  20             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, number one, that's 21 not explicit consent.  We can get into that later. 22             MR. KATYAL:  Well  well, I  23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the  24             MR. KATYAL:   I certainly  25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There's no  so punitive

35

2             MR. KATYAL:  Right, as long as they haven't

3 affirmatively disclaimed it.  And I think that is,

4 Justice Kennedy, the proper rule.

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't know what

6 authority 

7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Again, what about limiting

8 

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, Justice

10 Kennedy.

11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't know what

12 authority Congress has to subject citizens of the

13 United States to that nonconstitutional forum.

14             MR. KATYAL:  It's exactly what this Court 

15 and Justice Kennedy joined this in Plains Commerce

16 Bank  because what this Court said is that, yes, there

17 are these constitutional concerns that  or that tribes

18 are  you know, tribes are outside the constitutional

19 system and so on.

20             But when someone consents through their

21 words or their actions, not express consent, then that

22 takes it out of that circumstance.

23             And so Dollar General had a remedy available

24 to it right away.  It  it didn't have  nobody forced

25 Dollar General to show up on the tribal lands.  Nobody

1 forced Dollar General to sell to these customers.

36

2 Nobody forced Dollar General to have this Youth

3 Opportunity Program.  And yes, like every employer in

4 this country, Justice Kennedy, when you do those things,

5 you open yourselves up to the reasonable liability that

6 follows.  This 

7             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me give you

8 another  another hypothetical:  Somebody goes to an

9 Indian casino and loses a lot of money, and then when

10 the person goes home, the person goes online and says

11 that, they  they cheated me.  The game was rigged.

12 The  the Blackjack dealer was doing something.  And

13 they  and so then the  the  the Tribe  could the

14 Tribe sue that person for defamation in tribal court?

15             MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think  I  I think

16 that that that's not something that would be permissible

17 under this Court's Atkinson Trading nexus test.  I think

18 it's got to be something that's got to be reasonably

19 anticipated, and I'm not really sure that that kind of

20 thing is.

21             All we're saying here is that this is a

22 circumstance in which, as the Solicitor General's brief

23 at Page 32 says, the law of every jurisdiction treats

24 this kind of thing as something that is a reasonably

25 anticipatory thing when someone's running a shop

But of course, as you were 10 saying, Justice Ginsburg, removal is not 11 constitutionally compelled.  So it would require a 12 statute. 13             Here the removal statute requires diversity, 14 full diversity between the parties, and $75,000 is the 15 limit.  And I don't think that we would say anything 16 that doesn't fall within that is somehow not an incident 17 of sovereignty. 18             And I also would point to this Court's 19 language in Iowa Mutual about the diversity statute, 20 because what this Court said with respect to the 21 diversity statute is, you know, it does require a 22 statute. 23             That statute doesn't really tell us 24 anything, one way or the other, about tribal 25 jurisdiction.  And what this Court went on to say is
Alderson Reporting Company

38 1 that civil tribal tort jurisdiction is an incident to 2 sovereignty.  It's Williams v. Lee.  It's about the 3 right of the people to govern themselves. 4             And, you know, to treat this, 5 Justice Kennedy, like express consent is to treat a 6 tribe the way you're treating the American Arbitration 7 Association or JAMS, and that has never been what this 8 Court has said.  When you're dealing with the Montana I 9 exception, which is a limited exception, it requires 10 really  you know, it requires a true relationship, an 11 open and honest consent of the kind that existed here, 12 in which they knew they were coming onto tribal lands 13 and subjecting themselves to tribal law. 14             JUSTICE BREYER:  Do  15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why was the 16 contractual provision acquiescence in the application of 17 tribal law limited in the way that it was if they were, 18 in fact, subjecting themselves to tribal jurisdiction 19 across the board? 20             MR. KATYAL:  I  I  I don't think it was 21 limited at all.  This is the language at Joint Appendix 22 page 45:  "This agreement and any related documents 23 shall be construed"  excuse me  "Dollar General 24 shall comply with all codes and requirements of all 25 Tribal and Federal Laws and regulations now enforced or
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
39 1 which may hereafter be enforced which are applicable and 2 pertain to Dollar General's specific use of the demised 3 premises." 4             That is not limited language. 5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there any reason 6 that the issue that we're arguing about couldn't be 7 dealt with through particular contractual provisions, as 8 they are in some cases where you either suggest 9 yourselves to the jurisdiction of the tribal court or 10 not? 11             MR. KATYAL:  Sure.  I think that they could, 12 on  on either side.  I think that's  that's 13 possible.  But I think what this Court has said, time 14 and again, is that that is not necessary. 15             Your language, Mr. Chief Justice, in Plains 16 Commerce Bank, is that you can consent by your words or 17 your actions.  This Court's earlier language in the 18 pathmarking Montana case is not that it requires 19 express consent, but rather through commercial dealing, 20 contracts, leases or other arrangements. 21             For you to go further than that and adopt my 22 friend's argument is to radically depart from that 23 pathmarking decision, and change the rules and put 24 tribes on no greater a footing than the American 25 Arbitration Association.

KATYAL:  Exactly. 11             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, is there any  and  12 and what is the word in Cherokee?  I forget.  It's 13 "something dependent nation."  What kind of  it was  14 there are two words  15             MR. KATYAL:  Domestic dependent  16             JUSTICE BREYER:  What? 17             MR.

All right. 19             So if, in fact, Tasmania had this kind of 20 situation, and an American went to Tasmania and got a 21 reasonable judgment, I take it our courts would enforce 22 that. 23             MR.

41 1 if I wanted  I wanted the limitation, and I wanted to 2 know if you wanted me to read one thing that you have 3 cited in respect to what is only impressionistic, that 4 the vast number of tribal courts are indistinguishable 5 in terms of fairness, et cetera, from the courts of  6 other courts in the United States, what would I read? 7             MR. KATYAL:  Well, I  I  I think, you 8 know, we've cited to, you know, some large  9             JUSTICE BREYER:  Which of those do you want 10 me to read? 11             MR. KATYAL:  Well, I  I think that maybe 12 Justice O'Connor's article is a good place to start. 13             And so I  I think what I would say there, 14 Justice Breyer, is that fairness concerns have never 15 been relevant to the jurisdictional inquiry.  I think 16 that's what this Court's decision in Iowa  Iowa Mutual 17 said. 18             With respect to your productliability 19 hypothetical, we think there are four limits on the rule 20 we have, which is why  you know, look, this has been 21 going on for a long time, tribal court jurisdiction. 22 Congress hasn't seen fit to modify it, you know, if they 23 were concerned about the concerns Justice Kennedy had. 24             And the reason is because this is a limited 25 thing.

You can't just 4 wander on to the Reservation the way the Oklahoma  5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If we're  if we're 6 going to evaluate the due process concerns on a 7 casebycase basis, as a general matter, it  does it 8 violate due process for a nonmember to be subjected to a 9 jury verdict where the jury consists solely of tribal 10 members? 11             MR. KATYAL:  Well  well, first of all, you 12 know, that's not necessarily what's going on here. 13 There's no jury trial in this case.  But  14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand that. 15 But it's kind of a yesorno question.  Does it  does 16 it violate due process as a general matter for a 17 nonmember to be subjected to a jury trial with the jury 18 composed solely of members of the Tribe? 19             MR. KATYAL:  I  I could see it violating 20 ICRA.  It wouldn't violate, formally, the Constitution. 21 It would violate, you know, the due  it arguably could 22 violate the Due Process Clauses incorporated into ICRA. 23 That would be something  24             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's because tribes are 25 not governed by the Due Process Clause.

43 1             MR. KATYAL:  Yes.  But they are governed  2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  They're nonconstitutional 3 entities. 4             MR. KATYAL:  Correct.  But Congress has 5 brought the Due Process Clause to tribes in the form of 6 ICRA.  And of course, Justice Kennedy, if they were more 7 concerned and said, look, we don't even like the way, 8 tribes, you're interpreting ICRA or something like that, 9 tribal courts, they could go further.  They could do 10 all  11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I guess they could  12             MR. KATYAL:  They could ban those juries. 13 They have plenary jurisdiction in this area.  That's why 14 the ball game is in Congress's court, Congress's shoes. 15 It's not in this Court's. 16             JUSTICE BREYER:  I  is it right?  I'm 17 thinking that there are $50,000 at stake in many cases. 18 And many citizens of New York who want to feel  sue 19 citizens of Massachusetts, do have to go before juries 20 to obtain the $50,000 in a Massachusetts court.  And 21 suppose the plaintiff is a Yankee fan? 22             (Laughter.) 23             MR. KATYAL:  That's  that's absolutely 24 right.  And  and  that's absolutely right, and I  25 and so in  in that sort of 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
44 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think that  2 you think the concerns are on the same level:  Forcing 3 somebody in a State court to be subjected  a 4 New Yorker to be subject to jurisdiction where 5 everyone's from Massachusetts because it's Massachusetts 6 court.  You think that's the same as subjecting a 7 nonmember accused of a terrible assault on an Indian to 8 jurisdiction before a jury consisting solely of members 9 of the Tribe. 10             MR. KATYAL:  I don't think it's the same, 11 Mr. Chief Justice, but I think there are two things 12 which make them similar.  One is that they themselves, 13 that nonmember, is consenting to that by going to  14 like the store here, setting up shop and running the 15 Tribal Opportunities Program and serving its members. 16             And number two, the big difference is that 17 Congress has full control over there.  If they are 18 concerned about all tribal member juries or something 19 like that, they can regulate those. 20             Civil jurisdiction and tribal courts have 21 been going on for decades, and we haven't seen Congress 22 doing that.  And indeed much  and very interesting 23 here, you've got the sovereigns of every relevant 24 entities, you've got the United States, as well as the 25 State of Mississippi itself, saying we're not concerned
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 about those things.  Actually, this is an incident of  2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The Constitution runs to 3 the people.  The people have a right to insist on the 4 Constitution even if Mississippi or the Federal 5 government doesn't care. 6             MR. KATYAL:  I completely agree with that, 7 Justice Kennedy.  My only point is to say that, here, 8 Dollar General has themselves, by opening  they  9 they have the keys to avoiding this by not showing up at 10 the Reservation  11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  This  this gets into 12 implied consent, express consent, you know, all the 13 hypotheticals.  You consent to have your luggage 14 searched, you go through this, I don't consent, I don't 15 consent  it's implied.  Everybody knows that. 16             But this is  this is quite  it seems to 17 me that the first exception in Montana is quite 18 different.  It talks about contracts, and the Tribe 19 could certainly have put this in a contract if they 20 wanted just like an arbitration clause. 21             MR. KATYAL:  Well, Justice Kennedy, we do 22 think  the argument doesn't depend on it, but we do 23 think that they did put it in the contract.  That's the 24 language that I was just reading to the Chief Justice. 25             But just to be clear, the language of
Alderson Reporting Company

1 Montana I is broader than what you're saying it is,

46

2 again, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases or

3 other arrangements.  And my friend, Mr. Goldstein,

4 clever as he may be, doesn't have an argument that this

5 isn't commercial dealing.  This is  this is, you know,

6 as good as  this is the heart  as I was saying, this

7 is the heartland of what Montana I is about.  This is a

8 circumstance in which a tribe is entering into a long 

9 store is entering into a longterm relationship.  And

10 any business in America doing this, whether they  they

11 set up shop in France or in the city of San Francisco,

12 knows they're opening themselves up to a  to the local

13 regulation that may follow.

14             JUSTICE ALITO:  If there were a forum

15 selection clause in this contract selecting State court,

16 would that bind Tribe member  members?

17             MR. KATYAL:  I do think it would.

18             JUSTICE ALITO:  If so, on what theory?

19             MR. KATYAL:  I think that the Tribe itself

20 has the ability to, just as they can decide to use the

21 American Arbitration Association or whatever, they can

22 buy into some other area of law.  I don't think that my

23 friend, Mr. Goldstein, is disagreeing.  He said

24 sometimes it's hard to do, in response to Justice Kagan.

25 I don't think it's hard to do at all because the whole

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
47 1 question is are you reasonably anticipating a certain 2 amount of jurisdiction, and you are. 3             And of course there's other solutions. 4 Indemnity provisions; if you're worried about the due 5 process  lack of due process, you can have indemnity 6 arrangements, as many leases do, including Dollar 7 General's current lease.  There's lots of different ways 8 to deal with this concern about, you know, lack of 9 constitutional concerns. 10             But this Court  11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Katyal, so why would 12 these plaintiffs want to bring the case in tribal court 13 where they can get, in your argument, they can get 14 Dollar General but they can't get Townsend?  If they 15 sued in State court, they could sue both defendants. 16             MR. KATYAL:  Mmhmm.  So because going after 17 Dollar General effectively does provide them all the 18 remedy they need, that's why they never appealed that 19 piece  piece of it. 20             And, you know, and the other thing is this 21 is really important as a matter of tribal sovereignty 22 that is  Williams v. Lee says it's about the right of 23 the people to govern themselves.  The Domestic Violence 24 brief gives other reasons why in general people want to 25 bring suits in tribal courts because it's a more
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 familiar process and one closer, geographically, to

48

2 them.  Many times State courthouses are hours and hours

3 away.  So that's  that's another reason.

4             But the bottom line here is this Court said

5 in Williams v. Lee this is about the right of the people

6 to govern themselves.  I appreciate the constitutional

7 concerns, but Plains Commerce Bank baked those into its

8 consent rule.  It said yes, there are those

9 constitutional concerns.  They would apply to some

10 wandering entity or something like that, but not to

11 someone who consents either through their words or their

12 actions.

13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just so you know, it

14 seemed to me a reading of the first Montana exception,

15 which is what we're talking about here, talking about

16 taxation, licensing, then it talks about consensual

17 relationships and we have this whole question:  Is it

18 explicit or is it implied?

19             And then it talks about commercial dealing

20 contracts, leases, or other arrangements.  That doesn't

21 sound like torts to me.  And it seems to me that since

22 there's a Reservation in mind, you might you want to

23 address it.

24             MR. KATYAL:  Sure.  So I think this Court in

25 Regal already said that torts are a form of regulation.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 I think there's no reason to think of torts any

49

7            ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

8           FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

9                SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

10             MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11 please the Court:

12             I'd like at the outset to respond to the

13 argument that tribal court jurisdiction over tort claims

14 is somehow inconsistent with the superior sovereignty of

15 the United States.

16             That argument was flatly rejected, I think,

17 in both National Farmers Union and Iowa Mutual where

18 this Court was asked to apply the rule of Oliphant to

19 civil jurisdiction.  And this Court, in an unanimous

20 decision joined by Justice Rehnquist, who was the author

21 of Oliphant, said that those principles do not apply to

22 civil jurisdiction.  Iowa Mutual and National Farmers

23 Union enforced the rule of exhaustion on that premise.

24             Then, importantly, not too long after that,

25 Congress undertook a thorough review of tribal courts in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
50 1 connection with the passage in 1993, as we explain in 2 our brief, of the Tribal Justice Improvements Act  3 Tribal Justice Act.  It held hearings, and in that  in 4 that statute, Congress made two specific findings: 5 Tribal justice systems are an essential part of tribal 6 government and serve important forums for ensuring 7 public health and safety and political integrity of the 8 Tribe, and Congress in Federal courts  9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Nobody denies that here. 10             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, no, but if I could  11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It is essential for  for 12 disputes between tribal members. 13             MR. KNEEDLER:  If I could finish, what 14 Congress's  Congress's judgment, the next finding, 15 Congress and Federal courts have repeatedly recognized 16 tribal justice systems as the appropriate forums for the 17 adjudication of disputes affecting personal and property 18 rights. 19             The committee reports on that statute made 20 clear that they  that those provisions were enacted in 21 light of Iowa Mutual and National Farmers Union, and in 22 fact, one of the  one of the committee reports says 23 that that second provision was added in recognition of 24 the jurisdiction that tribal courts have over 25 nonIndian 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  If it said personal and

2 property rights of nonTribal members.

3             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well 

4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or against nonTribal

5 members.  It makes no reference to that at all.

6             MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  The  what I'm saying,

7 it was enacted in the wake of National Farmers Union and

8 Iowa Mutual, which both concerned tort claims against

9 nonIndians.  And the legislative history makes clear

10 that Congress was implementing that, and it provided

11 funding for tribal courts.

12             Another point 

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think everybody who

14 voted for that statute was aware of that, right?

15             MR. KNEEDLER:  There were 

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  They were aware of those

17 cases, I'm sure.  Everybody who voted for that

18 language 

19             MR. KNEEDLER:  I  I 

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:   were aware that it  it

21 stemmed from those cases because that's what the

22 committee report says.

23             MR. KNEEDLER:  This  this was a statute

24 against the backdrop of two decisions of this Court

25 saying that the rule of Oliphant does not apply to civil

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 jurisdiction over nonIndians in tort cases

52

2 specifically.

3             And importantly also, in Iowa Mutual the

4 argument was made about, specifically in connection with

5 the diversity point, which Mr. Katyal has responded to,

6 but the argument that the policies of the deferred city

7 statute, such as concerns about perhaps competence of

8 tribal courts or bias, that they should at least inform

9 the analysis.  And the Court said that would be

10 inconsistent  and this is before the 1993 statute 

11 that would be inconsistent with Congress's judgment

12 about encouraging tribal courts as an important

13 expression of tribal sovereignty.

14             And then Congress comes along and provides

15 funding and training, statutes that  that provide for

16 training of tribal judges, money to support the payment

17 of tribal judges and to support tribes in publication of

18 their tribal codes.  Congress thoroughly examined this

19 and then again in the year 2000 enacted a statute with a

20 similar finding.

21             So what we have here is not congressional

22 silence but congressional approval of that, here in

23 particular.

25 know that you've answered  I'm going to assume

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

KNEEDLER:  Congress  the answer is 6 Congress has not placed it as part of the inherent 7 sovereignty of a  of a tribe that  that predates the 8 Constitution as  and was not displaced, as this Court 9 made quite clear in the National Farmers Union decision, 10 unlike in criminal cases where, from the start, from 11 1790  and this was an important part of the Court's 12 analysis  in  in Oliphant. 13             From the very beginning, Congress placed 14 criminal jurisdiction over crimes by nonIndians against 15 Indians in Federal courts in order to assure that they 16 would have the full protection of the Due Process Clause 17 in courts.  Congress has never done that with respect to 18 civil jurisdiction. 19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And it's not right that 20 everybody has the  the right to an Article III 21 tribunal. 22             MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  That was going to be  23 that was going to be my second point.  State courts over 24 issues of State law does not have the authority  or do 25 not have the ability to go to Federal court.  And  and

56

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but outofStaters do,

3 at least where there's an adequate amount in

4 controversy, right?

5             MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  The Constitution does

6 not require that.  It provides for it, but does not

7 provide  does not require it.  There's an

8 amountincontroversy requirement, and also a

9 completediversity requirement.

10             And if Dollar General was a Mississippi

11 corporation, there would be no  no ability to remove

12 it.

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is it consistent

14 with your concept of due process, as a general matter,

15 to have a nonmember tried by a jury consisting solely of

16 tribal members?

17             MR. KNEEDLER:  I  I think there's a very

18 strong argument that it is because the  the tribal

19 members are the citizens of the jurisdiction whose

20 courts are being held.  Just like when someone goes from

21 Alabama to Mississippi, they may be tried before a jury

22 of Mississippians who are not  of which that plaintiff

23 is not a member.  But if there is a problem with that,

24 that is why the Indian Civil Rights Act is there.  If

25 that is a due process problem, that is something that

Alderson Reporting Company

57

2             And Justice Kennedy, in response to your

3 concern, Congress has fulfilled its obligation with

4 respect to the jurisdiction of tribal courts over

5 nonmembers by the Indian Civil Rights Act to assure that

6 the protections that are equivalent to the Due Process

7 Clause are  are afforded people.

8             There may be  may be some 

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do the same thing with the

10 American Arbitration Association?

11             MR. KNEEDLER:  No, it could not.  The Tribes

12 have inherent sovereignty; the American Arbitration

13 Association does not.

14             The last thing I wanted to point out is 

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But  but I do think, on

16 your earlier point, there  there was not a general

17 practice before, say, 1900 at least, of trying nontribal

18 members before Indian civil tribal courts.

19             MR. KNEEDLER:  The courts 

20             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or  or is that

21 incorrect?

22             MR. KNEEDLER:  But  but  no.  There was

23 some with the five tribes in Oklahoma.  The Tribes did

24 not have developed judicial systems, but that does not

25 mean that they weren't resolving disputes in some

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 manner, however it may be.  They have now given

58

2 expression to dispute resolution through tribal court

3 systems, for which they should be commended, I think,

4 not  not undermined.

5             And again, the Court made that point in Iowa

6 Mutual, recognizing that tribes did not have courts at

7 the time, but that did not deprive them of jurisdiction

8 today.

9             And with respect to the consensual

10 relationship, I point out on page 372 of this Court's

11 decision in  in Nevada v. Hicks discussing the Montana

12 case, it was referring to private individuals who

13 voluntarily submitted themselves to tribal regulatory

14 jurisdiction by  by arrangements that they or their

15 employers entered into.  That precisely describes the

16 situation where you have consent hewn.  You have a

17 business operating on the Reservation pursuant to tribal

18 license, a tribal lease agreement, and this particular

19 child was working there because of a consensual

20 agreement.

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And so I could say that

22 person was subject to tribal regulatory jurisdiction,

23 which can be interpreted, narrowly, to mean the Tribe

24 can regulate that person's conduct.  If he violates that

25 conduct, the Tribe, as a tribe, can fine him.  It

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 doesn't necessarily mean that the regulatory

59

2 jurisdiction includes the  the power to impose tort

3 law and adjudicate tort law.

4             MR. KNEEDLER:  May I answer?

5             This Court has often said that tort law is a

6 form of regulation, and again, that Iowa Mutual and

7 those cases are premised on the idea that tribal tort

8 law governs.  And this Court's observation in Nevada v.

9 Hicks about El Paso, that the Navajo tribal law tort

10 claims, the tribal court  there was little doubt that

11 the tribal court had jurisdiction over those claims.

12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

13             Mr. Goldstein, five minutes remaining.

14         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

15               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

16             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Thank you.  I have three

17 points, and they all happen to relate to questions by

18 Justice Scalia.

19             The first deals with the question of whether

20 tribal tort law, the last point by my friend, is a form

21 of regulation.  And we have cases like Regal, we have

22 the preemption context in which the Court has said

23 something like that.  But the big difference is that

24 that is about the substance of the tort law, not the

25 forum where it occurs.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             Imagine a case like Regal.  We would say

60

2 that the application of State tort law was a form of

3 regulation.  But if that was heard in a Federal district

4 court, on removal, on  in diversity jurisdiction, or

5 on a Federal question, it would still be State

6 regulation.

7             So my point here is:  The most that can

8 establish is that the substantive tort law's regulation,

9 not the forum.  We do not agree that that's so, but it

10 would be the only thing that they could get from that

11 argument.  What would remain is the difference of

12 adjudication from the substance of the tort law.

13             The second point, as Justice Scalia, I will

14 line up my friend's committee reports against the text

15 of the Constitution.  We do not have an answer to the

16 fact that our constitutional tradition has three points

17 in it that are inconsistent with this form of

18 adjudication.  And two of them are not specific to the

19 States.

20             The Constitution is the supreme law of the

21 land in the United States.  This Court is the Supreme

22 Court of the United States.  That's not true just with

23 respect to the States, that is a bedrock  those are

24 bedrock principles.  Neither of them are true here.

25             We also think that our tradition is that you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
61 1 have access to a neutral court.  I understand; I accept 2 that Congress implemented that in a removal statute that 3 does not apply here.  But my point is that Congress 4 could not have understood that it was a necessary 5 incident of sovereignty when the States were subject to 6 removal jurisdiction at the time the tribes came into 7 the United States. 8             It is historically implausible to believe 9 that in all three of these respects, when the tribes 10 came into the United States, they were in a superior 11 position to the States.  And we know that from one other 12 example, and that is also at the time  so these are 13 the judiciary acts of 1789 and '90, Congress made the 14 judgments of State courts enforceable by full faith and 15 credit, but not tribal courts.  And it cannot be, then, 16 that it thought the tribal courts were better than the 17 State courts. 18             And it does relate, Mr. Chief Justice, to 19 your point that the Court has never held, despite 20 dictum, that a nonmember is subject to adjudication in a 21 tribal court.  Because if you haven't done it till now, 22 it is, I think, respectfully implausible to believe that 23 Congress thought it was true in 1880, at a time when the 24 tribes had much less developed legal systems. 25             My final point is  relates to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 administrability.  And you have been offered two

62

2 alternatives.  The other side says we have a test about

3 nexus and foreseeability.  I have a standard that says,

4 write it down in a contract.

5             My rule is infinitely more administrable

6 because the other side imagines that people will

7 constantly be running to State and Federal court saying

8 this nexus wasn't strong enough; I didn't know when I

9 mailed this to the Tribe, or this form of tribal tort

10 law is not quite foreseeable enough for me to know what

11 the rule is.

12             That is a bad system.  You have said, time

13 and again, that jurisdictional rules need to be known

14 ahead of time, and they need to be clear.  And I don't

15 understand the answer to our point that it is

16 disrespectful of the sovereignty that is asserted here.

17 If the Tribal Supreme Court can constantly be overruled

18 by a circuit court in Mississippi, are we seriously

19 treating it as an independent sovereign?  That 

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, let me ask you

21 something.  What then remains of the sovereignty of the

22 Indians?  They can  they can bring a tort suit against

23 you?  The Tribes can bring a tort suit against you for

24 dumping on their  on their land?  For defacing their

25 archeological digs?  I mean, why is that okay?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
63 1             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Justice Sotomayor, I 2 do not want to give up on our broader argument that 3 Montana's first exception doesn't apply here.  But our 4 position is consistent with the fact that this is a 5 question, as my friends have emphasized, of State 6 sovereignty.  And when the sovereign brings an action, 7 it is much easier to understand that that is an exercise 8 of self government and sovereignty than a private tort 9 suit between two people. 10             In addition, we have  11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It makes  you're  12 you just want to cherry pick what "sovereignty" means. 13             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Sotomayor  14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because if they're 15 sovereign, the United States can have treaties with 16 people that basically say in your land, you do what you 17 want; I'm not going to enforce your judgment if I don't 18 think it's consistent with due process here.  But we 19 don't dictate to other sovereigns what kind of systems 20 they should have. 21             You're right we have the power to do that, 22 but it's still something that we don't have to exercise. 23             MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Sotomayor, because 24 my time has expired, I will be brief.  The difference is 25 the dependent sovereignty of the Indian tribes and the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 fact that individuals have the protections of the

64

2 Constitution.
