 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear 
 4 argument now in No. 02-6320, John J. Fellers v. the 
 5 United States.
 6 Mr. Waxman.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 9 MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 
 10 please the Court:
 11 Unlike the two cases in which you heard 
 12 argument yesterday, and unlike Oregon v. Elstad, the 
 13 original inculpatory statement in this case was 
 14 elicited not merely in violation of a prophylactic 
 15 rule, but of the Constitution itself, specifically 
 16 the Sixth Amendment right of an accused to the 
 17 assistance of counsel throughout his criminal 
 18 prosecution, a right designed to protect equality in 
 19 the adversarial process by a --
 20 QUESTION: What is your authority, Mr. 
 21 Waxman, for saying that this is different from the 
 22 Miranda warnings in the sense that it's -- it's an 
 23 immediate violation rather than something --
 24 something like Miranda?
 25 MR. WAXMAN: Well, it's -- Your Honor, I 

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 guess I have a two-fold answer. First of all, the --
 2 the constitutional right involved is the Sixth 
 3 Amendment right, unlike in Miranda, the Fifth 
 4 Amendment right of self-incrimination. And in -- in 
 5 Oregon v. Elstad and Chavez v. Martinez, this Court 
 6 recognized that although the Fifth Amendment 
 7 self-incrimination right is not completed until the 
 8 statement or its fruits are introduced at trial, the 
 9 primary illegality, as this Court has used the 
 10 phrase, is the coercion of the confession, and the 
 11 Elstad rule doesn't apply where the primary 
 12 illegality is constitutionally-proscribed conduct.
 13 And here, this Court has not formally 
 14 decided whether the Sixth Amendment is violated at 
 15 the time the uncounseled, post-indictment statement 
 16 is deliberately elicited, or only when the statement 
 17 or fruits are admitted, that briefs of both sides 
 18 rehearse for the Court somewhat conflicting 
 19 statements in different opinions. 
 20 We rely on the cases cited in footnote 5 
 21 on page 8 of our reply brief, but for purposes of 
 22 this case, Your Honor, it doesn't matter, because in 
 23 Elstad, this Court made clear, and reiterated in 
 24 Chavez, that although the Fifth Amendment violation 
 25 is incomplete at the time a confession is coerced, 

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 nonetheless the fruits of that confession have to be 
 2 suppressed under the derivative evidence rule, unless 
 3 the Government carries its burden to prove sufficient 
 4 attenuation of taint. And therefore, even if the 
 5 conduct deliberately eliciting from Mr. Fellers his 
 6 inculpatory statement at a time when the officers 
 7 knew he had been indicted, and the prosecution knew 
 8 that he had a right to the advice of counsel, the 
 9 fruits of that statement under Nix and Wade have to 
 10 be suppressed. That's a rule that this Court has 
 11 applied in Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and 
 12 Sixth Amendment cases.
 13 QUESTION: Do police officers generally 
 14 know this distinction, that when an indictment has 
 15 been handed down, suddenly the Sixth Amendment is in 
 16 the case as well as the Fifth? There's an element of 
 17 fiction to it in that the person doesn't have a 
 18 lawyer yet. As a bright line rule, I guess, we need 
 19 some point to know when proceedings have commenced, 
 20 but I - I still think there's an element of fiction 
 21 in it.
 22 MR. WAXMAN: Well, Justice Kennedy, I 
 23 don't -- I don't think I would call it fiction. I'm 
 24 no more able to -- to testify than the member of this 
 25 Court would be as to exactly what training the police 

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 are told. But this Court has long established, long 
 2 maintained that the Sixth Amendment cuts very bright 
 3 lines. It is specific to the offense and it begins 
 4 only when, but when, the state makes the unilateral 
 5 determination to change its formal relationship with 
 6 an individual from one in which the individual may or 
 7 may not be under investigation, but the --
 8 QUESTION: Mr. Waxman, you -- you're 
 9 making a -- a very technical distinction, if I 
 10 understand you correctly. If we focus on the suspect 
 11 in the case of no indictment yet, who has been 
 12 arrested, and the person who has been indicted and 
 13 then arrested, and they're both alone with the same 
 14 police officers in the same jail cell, and they're 
 15 both subjected to the same interrogation. Why should 
 16 the derivative evidence rule apply to the one or not 
 17 the other? If we're talking about constitutional 
 18 rights, it seems to me that these two individuals are 
 19 similarly situated.
 20 MR. WAXMAN: Well, they -- they aren't, 
 21 Your Honor, and I don't think this is a matter of 
 22 technicality or formality. It is a matter of 
 23 formalism, but the two different amendments -- the 
 24 Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, 
 25 and the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of 

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 counsel throughout criminal prosecution, protect very 
 2 different things. The first protects voluntariness, 
 3 and the second protects the right of someone as to 
 4 whom the Government has formally set its face and 
 5 invoked a formal adversarial process.
 6 QUESTION: The point is why -- why should 
 7 that make a difference other than the convenience of 
 8 the bright line? As in Justice Ginsburg's 
 9 hypothetical, it could be the same drug ring, the 
 10 same investigation, just the grand jury has -- hasn't 
 11 got around to indicting the second defendant until 
 12 the next day and then their rights are different.
 13 MR. WAXMAN: Your -- Your Honor, it's --
 14 it is entirely true that if the Court agrees with --
 15 agrees with our submission here, that the Government 
 16 can very easily conform its conduct simply by not 
 17 conducting uncounseled interrogations or elicitations 
 18 prior to changing its status. But the -- the -- we 
 19 have to examine, this Court has exhorted counsel over 
 20 and over again to be clear about what the underlying 
 21 right is protected in determining what the 
 22 appropriate remedy is. 
 23 And the right here is not coercion. The 
 24 right here is not just addressed at police. It's 
 25 addressed at the prosecution. And there is a 

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 difference. You may call it technical, but it is in 
 2 fact the hallmark of our adversary system that once 
 3 the Government decides to invoke a formal adversary 
 4 process, it proceeds on the supposition that each 
 5 side deals with each other, A, at arm's length, and 
 6 B, assisted by the advice of counsel, who will 
 7 prevent each side, and in particularly the defendant, 
 8 from, as this Court has explained in -- from 
 9 conviction resulting from his own ignorance of his 
 10 legal and constitutional rights, and that's what's 
 11 being protected.
 12 The unindicted individual, as to whom the 
 13 Government may be conducting an investigation, 
 14 doesn't have that formal right, but once the 
 15 Government invokes our adversarial system, it invokes 
 16 a set of protections that protect, not an 
 17 individual's right to be protected from coercion or 
 18 involuntariness -- that's protected no matter when 
 19 the custodial -
 20 QUESTION: Well, how -- how far does this 
 21 right go, Mr. Waxman? Are you -- are you saying that 
 22 police officers can't talk to someone who has been 
 23 indicted?
 24 MR. WAXMAN: Oh no, of course not. Your 
 25 Honor has made clear for the - in his opinion for the 

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Court in Patterson v. Illinois -- I believe it was 
 2 Your Honor -- in any event, the Court made clear in 
 3 Patterson v. Illinois that the Sixth Amendment right 
 4 to the assistance of counsel doesn't prevent the 
 5 Government from eliciting statements from an indicted 
 6 defendant. It requires that the accused either have 
 7 counsel or make a waiver of the right to counsel, and 
 8 the Court --
 9 QUESTION: Well, but it's - it's - I'm -
 10 I'm talking about a situation where, say the police 
 11 simply say something to a -- an indicted defendant. 
 12 There's no violation of a right there, is there?
 13 MR. WAXMAN: There only is a violation of 
 14 a right, Your Honor, if what -- if the police 
 15 statements and conduct amount to what this Court has 
 16 deemed deliberate elicitation. That is, that what 
 17 the Court has said in a half a dozen cases is that 
 18 the Government may not do without counsel is 
 19 deliberately elicit incriminating statements in the 
 20 absence of his lawyer.
 21 QUESTION: And you think that's what 
 22 happened here?
 23 MR. WAXMAN: I am -- I am absolutely 
 24 certain that that's what happened here, and the --
 25 QUESTION: That was the finding of the 

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 magistrate and the --
 2 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. The magistrate who 
 3 heard that police officers, Justice O'Connor, found 
 4 specifically that officers --
 5 QUESTION: He found deliberate eliciting 
 6 of the comments at the first statement?
 7 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. He said it was, quote, 
 8 designed to elicit a response -- I'm quoting from 
 9 page 103 of the joint appendix --
 10 QUESTION: Is that a factual finding or --
 11 MR. WAXMAN: It is.
 12 QUESTION: -- or a legal conclusion? I 
 13 mean, it seems to me he can -- he can find as a fact 
 14 what the officer said, but whether it constitutes 
 15 deliberate elicitation within the meaning of our - of 
 16 our opinion, it seems to me, is a legal question.
 17 MR. WAXMAN: Well, it's - I think, Your 
 18 Honor, Justice Scalia, it's -- this is a mixed 
 19 question of law and fact under Miller v. Fenton and 
 20 Thompson v. Keohane. But because --
 21 QUESTION: And the Eighth -- the Eighth 
 22 Circuit said, the Eighth Circuit is the closest court 
 23 to this one, and I thought that the Eighth Circuit 
 24 said, and that it's a threshold question in this 
 25 case, that it wasn't anything like interrogation, and 

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that that's -- wasn't that the -- the --
 2 MR. WAXMAN: The Eighth --
 3 QUESTION: -- prime ground of the Eighth 
 4 Circuit?
 5 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, the Eighth 
 6 Circuit -- two judges, the majority, the panel in the 
 7 Eighth Circuit, concluded that it wasn't 
 8 interrogation. The concurring judge --
 9 QUESTION: But wouldn't we have to answer 
 10 that --
 11 MR. WAXMAN: -- pointed out, Judge Riley 
 12 pointed out, that under the Sixth Amendment, unlike 
 13 the Fifth, interrogation is not the standard. The 
 14 standard is deliberate elicitation, or, as this Court 
 15 has also phrased it, whether the prosecution, quote, 
 16 intentionally creates a situation likely to induce 
 17 the accused to make incriminating statements without 
 18 the advise of counsel.
 19 QUESTION: I thought the Eighth Circuit's 
 20 position was that all this was was the police 
 21 informing the defendant that he had been charged with 
 22 this and this crime.
 23 MR. WAXMAN: That is -- the -- the -- I 
 24 don't believe the Eighth Circuit made any such 
 25 finding, but the magistrate who heard the two 

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 officers testify and evaluated their credibility made 
 2 a determination, Justice Scalia, that is a mixed 
 3 question of fact and law. The inquiry under the 
 4 Sixth Amendment, deliberate elicitation or 
 5 intentional creation of a situation, or purposeful 
 6 conduct, which are the words this Court has used, 
 7 involve a determination, among other things, about 
 8 the credibility of what the officers said.
 9 And when the magistrate concluded that 
 10 they -- that their conduct was designed to elicit a 
 11 response, and that it was not made for any purpose 
 12 other than to get a response --
 13 QUESTION: Well, was - was there any 
 14 debate or controversy about what they in fact said?
 15 MR. WAXMAN: There was no debate about 
 16 what they said, but -- but there was a credibility 
 17 finding made by the magistrate, because the --
 18 QUESTION: If there was -- if there was no 
 19 factual dispute, why - why did -- why was credibility 
 20 involved?
 21 MR. WAXMAN: Well, when you have -- when 
 22 you -- because there is a subjective intent here, the 
 23 subjective intent of whether Officer Bliemeister, he 
 24 came to the house knowing that this man had been 
 25 indicted, and said, we are here to discuss with you 

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 your involvement with methamphetamine and your 
 2 involvement with four individuals.
 3 QUESTION: Well, why -- why should 
 4 subjective intent make any difference here? I mean, 
 5 the -- the effect on the -- on the accused is exactly 
 6 the same.
 7 MR. WAXMAN: Your Honor, I'm -- I'm simply 
 8 reciting back for -- for you the court's 
 9 instructions, and -- and saying that if the standard 
 10 is deliberate elicitation and intentionally creating 
 11 a situation, it essentially, in terms of providing a 
 12 line, it proscribes what the police may not 
 13 deliberately do, and --
 14 QUESTION: Well --
 15 MR. WAXMAN: -- but deliberateness, I 
 16 think, is a finding of the magistrate, which -- to 
 17 which the Eighth Circuit and this Court owe 
 18 deference.
 19 QUESTION: But deliberateness may refer to 
 20 nothing more than intending the statement that was 
 21 made, and whether it elicits or not, or whether it 
 22 constitutes elicitation -- what a terrible word --
 23 whether it constitutes elicitation, it seems to me, 
 24 can be judged objectively, can't it?
 25 MR. WAXMAN: Your Honor, perhaps, but 

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 designed to elicit, it strikes me as including a 
 2 subjective component. But even if I'm wrong, I 
 3 submit that the magistrate was correct as an a priori 
 4 matter in saying, look, these people -- these 
 5 officers -- these agents of the prosecution, came to 
 6 this man's house. They not only knew he had been 
 7 indicted, Officer Bliemeyer had been the witness --
 8 QUESTION: Bliemeister, I think.
 9 MR. WAXMAN: Bliemeister -- had been the 
 10 witness before the grand jury, and he comes --
 11 QUESTION: Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, I -- I will 
 12 assume that that is correct. I mean, I -- the record 
 13 looks to me just as you're describing it. But 
 14 assuming that, do you think there is any practical 
 15 difference between what Deputy Bliemeister did here 
 16 and what the officer did in Elstad?
 17 MR. WAXMAN: I don't remember what the 
 18 officer did in Elstad.
 19 QUESTION: Well, in -- in Elstad, the --
 20 there were two officers, one went with the mother of 
 21 the suspect into the kitchen to tell her why they 
 22 were there. The other one -- excuse me -- stayed in 
 23 another room with the -- with the boy who was the 
 24 suspect and started telling them what they were there 
 25 to -- to investigate, there was a burglary next door. 

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 And at the end of the conversation that's quoted in 
 2 the opinion he said, you know, I -- I think you may 
 3 know something about that, and the boy said, yes he 
 4 did. And it seems to me that the elicitation there 
 5 was functionally about the same as the elicitation 
 6 here.
 7 MR. WAXMAN: Well, that --
 8 QUESTION: But I want to know whether you 
 9 agree.
 10 MR. WAXMAN: I -- I actually don't agree. 
 11 I think -- I think for other reasons, that is, the --
 12 the fact that this is a Sixth Amendment it doesn't 
 13 matter. But I do think --
 14 QUESTION: Well --
 15 MR. WAXMAN: -- when the police officers 
 16 come and say, we are here to discuss with you the 
 17 following things, which happened to be the precise 
 18 things that he has just been indicted for, that is a 
 19 paradigm -- paradigmatic deliberate elicitation.
 20 QUESTION: Well, yeah, but --
 21 MR. WAXMAN: And --
 22 QUESTION: -- to -- to say to a kid, you 
 23 know, I think you may know something about this, and 
 24 the person making that statement's a cop, sounds like 
 25 elicitation to me.

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. WAXMAN: Well, if -- if -- Mr. --
 2 QUESTION: Functionally -- if -- if 
 3 functionally it is, let's assume -- I -- I tend to 
 4 think it is -- and -- and functionally in each case, 
 5 whether it's Fifth Amendment right or Sixth Amendment 
 6 right, the statement doesn't come in unless there is, 
 7 among other things, a voluntary waiver of the right 
 8 to the presence of counsel then and there. And in --
 9 in each case we didn't have it. It's hard for me to 
 10 see why in functional terms it should make a 
 11 difference whether we're talking about Sixth or Fifth 
 12 and why there should be a difference between this 
 13 case and Elstad.
 14 MR. WAXMAN: Because the functional 
 15 analysis depends on the right being protected. The 
 16 Fifth Amendment right does not embed a policy against 
 17 deliberate elicitation of information from suspects. 
 18 In fact, our system embraces that. And if there was 
 19 a violation in Elstad, it was --
 20 QUESTION: Well, neither does the Sixth. 
 21 The -- what the Sixth says is, before you try 
 22 anything like that, you've either got to have his 
 23 counsel present or his counsel permission or his 
 24 waiver of it. What's the difference?
 25 MR. WAXMAN: It -- the difference is 

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 what's being protected. What's being protected in 
 2 the Fifth is coercion. What's being protected in the 
 3 Sixth in this instance is precisely what --
 4 QUESTION: Well, Mr. Waxman, isn't it also 
 5 true that in one case there was an indictment, in the 
 6 other there wasn't?
 7 MR. WAXMAN: Well, yes. And what the 
 8 Sixth Amendment protects in terms, Justice Souter, is 
 9 that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall 
 10 enjoy the right to the assistance of counsel.
 11 QUESTION: And -- and recognize he's got 
 12 that right because there was the indictment. And in 
 13 the Fifth Amendment case, the Miranda case, we 
 14 recognized that he's got that right, because this 
 15 Court has said that's the only way you're going to 
 16 make the Fifth Amendment work. So we start with the 
 17 assumption that he's got the right, and that in fact 
 18 the elicitation or statements that produce his 
 19 statement are -- are -- are improper. His statement 
 20 is inadmissible unless there's a waiver of the right 
 21 to the presence of counsel at that time.
 22 MR. WAXMAN: Absolutely. And that gets us 
 23 right to Elstad, and the line that this Court drew in 
 24 Elstad at the very outset of its opinion, which is 
 25 that the consequences of an interrogation in 

17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 violation of Miranda differ importantly from the 
 2 consequences of a violation of the Constitution 
 3 itself, that is, primary illegality that goes 
 4 directly, without prophylaxis, to what the 
 5 Constitution proscribes. And this Court said over 
 6 and over and over again in Elstad that we will not 
 7 apply a derivative evidence rule where the violation 
 8 is only the former, but we will apply it in the 
 9 latter. 
 10 And that is the key distinction in this 
 11 case. The distinction is not that the statements 
 12 that they elicited from Mr. Fellers at his home 
 13 didn't also violate Miranda, if he was in custody and 
 14 the court found that he was, they did.
 15 QUESTION: But most of our Miranda cases, 
 16 we recognize that the -- the police nationwide 
 17 understand the dynamics of Miranda. I have no 
 18 empirical basis, and apparently you don't know 
 19 either. My assumption is most police officers would 
 20 be very surprised if there's a difference between 
 21 Fifth and Sixth --
 22 MR. WAXMAN: But --
 23 QUESTION: -- their Fifth and Sixth 
 24 Amendment obligations in -- in this -- in these 
 25 circumstances.

18
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. WAXMAN: But Justice Kennedy, I submit 
 2 to you that it doesn't matter as a matter of 
 3 constitutional prophylaxis. It may very well -- what 
 4 the police officers know is, they knew they had to 
 5 give him his Miranda warnings there. That we can be 
 6 sure of. And they also knew that there would be 
 7 consequences for not doing it, and this is not just 
 8 the police. If it -- if it please the Court, this is 
 9 the prosecution. Once there is an indictment, the 
 10 police are not acting on their own. The police are 
 11 part of the government prosecution, and if police 
 12 don't know that, and are trying to game the system 
 13 the way we heard it yesterday, it's the burden of the 
 14 prosecution -- the prosecution and the Government to 
 15 make sure that they do understand that.
 16 What we're talking about here is the 
 17 preservation of -- as this Court has said it --
 18 equality -- equality of each side once the Government 
 19 unilaterally define -- changes its posture with 
 20 respect to someone so that that person is accused, 
 21 and when it does that, it has to make -- it has to 
 22 take steps to avoid interfering with the ability of 
 23 the defendant at all critical stages and all 
 24 confrontations to proceed based on ignorance or 
 25 misapprehension of his rights or the legal 

19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 consequences. 
 2 I realize this sounds like --
 3 QUESTION: Mr. Waxman, can I -- Mr. 
 4 Waxman, can I just clarify that we do have the 
 5 threshold question in this case, right? Because as 
 6 it stands in the Eighth Circuit, you don't even have 
 7 a foot in the door because there was no 
 8 interrogation, it was only -- so we have to overturn 
 9 the Eighth Circuit on that point before we get to 
 10 what you're now talking about.
 11 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, Your Honor. Now, the --
 12 the Eighth Circuit was incorrect, because it applied 
 13 the wrong standard. It asked whether there was 
 14 interrogation, when this Court made clear in Rhode 
 15 Island v. Innis that that is not the test under the 
 16 Sixth Amendment for good reasons, and in any event, 
 17 this was the, quote, functional equivalent of 
 18 interrogation. I mean --
 19 QUESTION: Well, because of the Eighth 
 20 Circuit's position on the original statements, it 
 21 really didn't address the subsequent jailhouse 
 22 statements in any proper fashion, did it?
 23 MR. WAXMAN: No. It -- it said -- what 
 24 the Eighth Circuit said is, look, we don't think that 
 25 there was a primary illegality, and therefore, we 

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 don't have to discuss --
 2 QUESTION: Right.
 3 MR. WAXMAN: -- what the fruits 
 4 consequences are.
 5 QUESTION: So I suppose -- if we were to 
 6 agree with you on the first statements and conclude 
 7 they were deliberately elicited, we'd have to remand, 
 8 I suppose --
 9 MR. WAXMAN: I don't think so, Your Honor.
 10 QUESTION: -- on the second question.
 11 MR. WAXMAN: Because the question 
 12 presented in the petition, the second question 
 13 presented in the petition is, okay, assuming that 
 14 there was a violation of the Sixth Amendment in the 
 15 first interrogation, does the invocation, the mere 
 16 invocation of Miranda warnings, cleanse that taint?
 17 QUESTION: No, it wasn't that --
 18 QUESTION: Well, except the Eighth Circuit 
 19 didn't address that second question.
 20 QUESTION: Right.
 21 MR. WAXMAN: That's correct.
 22 QUESTION: Well, would you like to say 
 23 something about it --
 24 MR. WAXMAN: I would.
 25 QUESTION: -- because I -- in looking at 

21
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 it, I want -- would like you to address the 
 2 particular argument. First, the questioning at the 
 3 house was about whether he'd ever participated in 
 4 taking drugs with these people. The relevant 
 5 question was whether he distributed drugs at the 
 6 station. They did ask him if he wanted a lawyer. He 
 7 did consciously waive it. And therefore, in fact, 
 8 since this case is about a right to a lawyer, maybe 
 9 if he'd had a lawyer it would have made a difference, 
 10 but it's hard to see how the decision not to have the 
 11 lawyer flowed from the first.
 12 MR. WAXMAN: Well --
 13 QUESTION: So they're different subject 
 14 matters. Time passes and it's pretty attenuated to 
 15 say that that first violation led him to the second. 
 16 All right. Those are the arguments, et cetera.
 17 MR. WAXMAN: Okay.
 18 QUESTION: What do you say?
 19 MR. WAXMAN: I'll -- I'll answer Justice 
 20 O'Connor's question first and then your question. 
 21 Justice O'Connor, the -- the -- the point here is 
 22 that this Court has uniformly held that where there 
 23 is conduct that constitutes primary illegality in 
 24 violation of the Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth Amendments, 
 25 not just a prophylactic rule, but the constitutional 

22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 requirement itself, the remedy is, you apply the 
 2 derivative evidence rule, which puts the burden on 
 3 the Government to prove that the taint has 
 4 sufficiently attenuated.
 5 QUESTION: But certainly the -- the -- the 
 6 defendant can waive his right to counsel later on, 
 7 and he did.
 8 MR. WAXMAN: He absolutely can. And our 
 9 case doesn't --
 10 QUESTION: And he did.
 11 MR. WAXMAN: He --
 12 QUESTION: Do you think it's tainted 
 13 simply because if we find a violation originally?
 14 MR. WAXMAN: Our -- our case, Your Honor, 
 15 doesn't depend on any argument or showing that the 
 16 second statement was either involuntary or that the 
 17 waiver of the right to counsel was not knowing and 
 18 intelligent. Our submission is that the second 
 19 statement is the fruit of the poisonous tree, just as 
 20 if it were a piece of inanimate evidence. There's 
 21 nothing wrong if somebody said -- with what the -- if 
 22 police going and finding the body in the Nix case, 
 23 the Christian burial case, but it's tainted because 
 24 they got the -- that information derived from a 
 25 violation of the Sixth Amendment. I had not up here 

23
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 -2 QUESTION: But he can certainly waive his 
 3 Sixth Amendment right later. I just don't understand 
 4 why what you say necessarily follows. We've never 
 5 held that squarely, have we?
 6 MR. WAXMAN: Well, you -- you have never 
 7 held in a Sixth Amendment --
 8 QUESTION: No.
 9 MR. WAXMAN: You've never held the -- the 
 10 precise question that's presented here for sure. But 
 11 you have held that where there is conduct that 
 12 violates the Sixth Amendment, this is Nix and Wade, 
 13 the fruits of that conduct, regardless of what 
 14 happens thereafter, are excludable as fruit of the 
 15 poisonous tree, unless the Government shoulders its 
 16 taint-attenuation burden.
 17 And you have also held in a variety of 
 18 cases that, starting with Wong Sun, that where the 
 19 fruit is testimonial evidence, it too has to be 
 20 excluded with the understanding that the administer 
 21 -- the intervening administration of Miranda warnings 
 22 are potent evidence, but they are not sufficient in 
 23 and of themselves to establish taint attenuation. 
 24 You said it in Brown. You said it last term in Kaupp 
 25 v. Texas. You've said it in Dunaway and any number 

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 of other cases.
 2 QUESTION: How is the second statement the 
 3 fruit of the first?
 4 MR. WAXMAN: The first statement in the 
 5 first -- I mean, as a -- that -- this is a sort of a 
 6 common sense, practical analysis, but in the first 
 7 statement he was -- he acknowledged that he had used 
 8 methamphetamines and he had associated with the four 
 9 individuals that the police officer named. And you, 
 10 Justice Breyer, the indictment was conspiracy to 
 11 possess methamphetamines with intent to distribute 
 12 and to distribute. He made very inculpatory 
 13 statements.
 14 Thirty minutes later, he executes a 
 15 Miranda warning -- waiver -- in the station house, 
 16 and he is asked, okay, tell us more about this 
 17 possession and tell us person by person about your 
 18 association with those four people. They then go on 
 19 and ask more questions about other people, but in 
 20 this case, the link between the two is as direct as 
 21 one can possibly imagine. I mean, this Court has 
 22 established a -- has long recognized a presumption 
 23 that where the -- when the Government acquires 
 24 evidence in violation of the Constitution, any 
 25 substantially similar evidence obtained by the police 

25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 subsequent to that derives from it unless the 
 2 Government can prove it doesn't. That was waived.
 3 QUESTION: I can under -- I can understand 
 4 the position, although I'm not entirely persuaded by 
 5 it, that where -- when you are violate -- have 
 6 violated the Fifth Amendment and gotten a confession 
 7 that's already on the table, the second confession is 
 8 sort of the fruit of that, because the person thinks, 
 9 what the heck, I've already confessed, I may as well 
 10 -- that's the argument that it's the fruit.
 11 MR. WAXMAN: The taint --
 12 QUESTION: But I don't -- but I don't see 
 13 how the waiver of -- of counsel the second time is 
 14 the -- is the fruit of the improper approach the 
 15 first time. I mean, I -- I don't see somebody 
 16 saying, what the heck, I waived counsel the first 
 17 time, I may as well waive it the second.
 18 MR. WAXMAN: Your Honor, the taint --
 19 QUESTION: That doesn't follow the way --
 20 the way confession does.
 21 MR. WAXMAN: The taint, which this Court 
 22 in Elstad, in part IIa of its opinion in Elstad, said 
 23 was insufficient -- IIb -- was insufficient to prove 
 24 involuntariness, is in fact what demonstrates that 
 25 there is fruit of the poisonous tree here in the 

26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 link, and that is the accepted, common sense 
 2 proposition that an uncounseled accused, from whom 
 3 the Government deliberately elicits an unwarned, 
 4 incriminatory statement after it institutes 
 5 adversarial proceedings, is erroneously likely to 
 6 believe that there is little to be gained and much to 
 7 be lost from attempting to avoid further 
 8 incrimination.
 9 QUESTION: Well, now, but is there -- is 
 10 there some authority for that specific proposition 
 11 that you just said?
 12 MR. WAXMAN: This Court recognized it in 
 13 Bayer, in Brown, in --
 14 QUESTION: Did it say -- I -- I'm -- you --
 15 you just recited kind of a litany. Did the Court 
 16 recite that sort of a litany in Bayer?
 17 MR. WAXMAN: Well, in Brown, for example, 
 18 it said that the second warrant statement, quote, was 
 19 clearly the result and fruit of the first. The fact 
 20 that Brown had made one statement believed by him to 
 21 be admissible bolstered the pressures for him to give 
 22 the second, or at least vitiated any incentive on his 
 23 part to avoid self-incrimination.
 24 QUESTION: But that -- that's a -- that's 
 25 a first statement. That's -- you're -- you're 

27
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 talking here about a waiver of counsel and you're 
 2 saying that's the same thing.
 3 MR. WAXMAN: It is the same thing. In 
 4 that case they were talking about the second 
 5 statement, which was preceded by a waiver of counsel, 
 6 and making not the, Your Honor, not the legal 
 7 judgment that the second statement was there for 
 8 coerced or involuntary, but the practical -- what 
 9 this Court has described as the psychological and 
 10 practical disadvantage of having confessed a first 
 11 time can be regarded as a fruit of the first.
 12 QUESTION: Yeah, but isn't the -- the --
 13 isn't the -- correct me if I'm wrong. I think your 
 14 theory is that the waiver itself is likely to be a 
 15 fruit because a person is going to say, I've already 
 16 let the cat out of the bag, what do I need a lawyer 
 17 for. Is -- is --
 18 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. That's -- as --
 19 QUESTION: -- that your position?
 20 MR. WAXMAN: -- as -- as Justice Harlan 
 21 stated in his concurrence in Darwin, which is only a 
 22 concurrence, but I think is sort of the --
 23 QUESTION: Well, but that -- that's -- the 
 24 cat out of the bag is what we rejected in Elstad.
 25 MR. WAXMAN: You rejected it, Your Honor, 

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 as evidence or as constituting or -- or eliciting a 
 2 presumption of involuntariness. But you did it only 
 3 after -- in part IIa of your opinion in Elstad, you 
 4 said, derivative evidence rule doesn't apply. Fruits 
 5 are not going to be excluded from Elstad -- from a 
 6 Miranda violation. Now, the Court said in part IIb, 
 7 now we have to deal with the contention that he says 
 8 it's involuntary, and his only evidence that it's 
 9 involuntary is that it was the cat out of the bag and 
 10 there was this psychological compulsion. 
 11 That's too attenuated and hypothetical to 
 12 constitute a presumption of compulsion, but it is 
 13 precisely what this Court has recognized in Brown and 
 14 Dunaway and Bayer and Taylor and Harrison as being a 
 15 psychological fact --
 16 QUESTION: And that should make the case 
 17 -- that case that we heard yesterday easier than this 
 18 one if that's the standard, because there, the first 
 19 unwarned set of questions was much more intense, much 
 20 more detailed than in this case.
 21 MR. WAXMAN: Right. And the -- the only 
 22 burden in the -- in the case yesterday that I don't 
 23 have is that the primary illegality was a violation 
 24 of Miranda, and not of the Fifth Amendment 
 25 prohibition against coerced confessions itself.

29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Thank you.
 2 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Waxman.
 3 Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.
 4 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
 5 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 6 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 
 7 it please the Court:
 8 On the central legal issue in this case, 
 9 the critical fact is that, at the jailhouse, after 
 10 petitioner was transported from his home, petitioner 
 11 received a full set of Miranda warnings, which 
 12 apprised him of his right to counsel, and knowingly, 
 13 voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to 
 14 counsel.
 15 QUESTION: Did the Eighth Circuit ever 
 16 decide whether there was a knowing and voluntary 
 17 waiver at the jailhouse?
 18 MR. DREEBEN: Yes. I believe that the 
 19 Eighth Circuit did, Justice O'Connor, because the 
 20 Eighth Circuit applied Oregon v. Elstad to reject 
 21 what appears to be a Miranda-style argument that 
 22 petitioner made in addition to his Sixth Amendment 
 23 argument.
 24 QUESTION: I thought that perhaps since 
 25 they didn't think the first statement posed a problem 

30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that they never really got to the crux of the 
 2 jailhouse inquiry.
 3 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I think in -- in 
 4 part, Justice O'Connor, your reading of the opinion 
 5 is correct. The court did say that under Patterson, 
 6 the Sixth Amendment argument that petitioner is 
 7 making in this Court doesn't get out of the starting 
 8 gate, because there was no interrogation, it used the 
 9 word interrogation. There was an issue about whether 
 10 interrogation is equivalent to deliberate 
 11 elicitation, and I'll try to address that.
 12 But before the court got to the Sixth 
 13 Amendment question, it addressed on pages 121 and 122 
 14 of the joint appendix the argument based on Elstad, 
 15 and the argument that the petitioner made was that 
 16 the statements made at the jailhouse should be 
 17 suppressed -- and this is on page 121 of the joint 
 18 appendix -- because the primary taint of the 
 19 improperly elicited statements made at his home was 
 20 not removed by the recitation of his Miranda rights 
 21 at the jail.
 22 And then the court went on to discuss 
 23 Oregon v. Elstad in detail and rejected that holding, 
 24 that argument. And the way that I interpret that 
 25 passage is that the court affirmed the district 

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 court's explicit finding of a knowing, voluntary, and 
 2 intelligent waiver, and applied Elstad to reject that 
 3 claim.
 4 QUESTION: Just so I understand what the 
 5 Sixth Amendment rule is, if the Sixth Amendment 
 6 prohibits the state from eliciting statements when 
 7 the defend -- when proceedings have begun, outside 
 8 presence of counsel, is it wrong for them to give the 
 9 Miranda warning and if he's then silent, then go 
 10 ahead and say, now you've had your Miranda warning, 
 11 would you like to talk to us? Is that consistent 
 12 with the Sixth Amendment rules that we impose? That 
 13 is to say, can you elicit the statement after you've 
 14 given the waiver, consistently with the Sixth 
 15 Amendment right?
 16 MR. DREEBEN: Yes. Patterson v. Illinois 
 17 specifically addressed the question of what does it 
 18 take for officers to obtain a waiver of counsel. The 
 19 only point where I would disagree, Justice Kennedy, 
 20 with your summary is that presence of counsel is not 
 21 required. The defendant has the right to choose 
 22 whether to have or to waive counsel.
 23 And in Patterson, the Court held that the 
 24 Miranda warnings conveyed to a suspect who has been 
 25 indicted all of the information needed to make a 

32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 knowing and a voluntary and intelligent waiver of 
 2 counsel in custodial interrogation. That's what 
 3 petitioner got.
 4 QUESTION: And they can attempt to elicit 
 5 that waiver consistently with the Sixth Amendment?
 6 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct. They can 
 7 approach the defendant, apprise him of his rights, 
 8 and if the defendant then makes a knowing and 
 9 intelligent waiver of his rights --
 10 QUESTION: No, that wasn't my question. 
 11 Can they -- can they advise him of those rights, he's 
 12 silent, and then try to elicit the statement? Say, 
 13 now we've apprised you of your rights and we want you 
 14 to talk to us. Is that consistent with the Sixth 
 15 Amendment?
 16 MR. DREEBEN: I think so, if that's 
 17 construed as seeking a waiver of his right to 
 18 counsel. Of course, there has to be a finding that 
 19 there was in fact a waiver of the right to counsel. 
 20 The police officers can't simply read Miranda 
 21 warnings, provide no interruption whatsoever to make 
 22 sure that the defendant actually understood them, and 
 23 then barge right ahead.
 24 Now, there are cases where the courts have 
 25 to decide whether there was an implicit waiver of 

33
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

2 case like that, because the Miranda waiver form in 
 3 the record clearly indicates --
 4 QUESTION: But, Mr. Dreeben, maybe I'm 
 5 wrong on the facts, but you're relying on the waiver 
 6 at the station house?
 7 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct.
 8 QUESTION: Do you agree that prior to that 
 9 waiver there had already been a violation of the 
 10 Sixth Amendment?
 11 MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Stevens. Our --
 12 QUESTION: Well, then -- then you don't 
 13 need the waiver.
 14 MR. DREEBEN: That -- that is true. I --
 15 my submission is on the critical legal question. 
 16 Even if the Court finds against us on what I would 
 17 acknowledge is a close question about whether the 
 18 interaction at the home constituted deliberate 
 19 elicitation under the Sixth Amendment --
 20 QUESTION: Assume it was deliberate 
 21 elicitation. Would you say it was a violation then?
 22 MR. DREEBEN: No, I wouldn't say that it 
 23 was a -- an actual violation of the Sixth Amendment 
 24 at the time. The Sixth Amendment is a trial right. 
 25 The right to counsel has to be evaluated by reference 

34 Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 -2 QUESTION: So even if there was no waiver 
 3 at the home, there -- there still was no violation of 
 4 the Constitution?
 5 MR. DREEBEN: Not at that time. I -- I 
 6 want to make it perfectly clear, Justice Stevens --
 7 QUESTION: It seems to me a rather extreme 
 8 position.
 9 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I don't think it 
 10 is extreme, because I'm going to follow it up with 
 11 what I think Your Honor is getting to, which is, can 
 12 the police simply go to an indicted suspect's home, 
 13 ignore his right to counsel, and engage in 
 14 questioning? And the answer is, generally no, 
 15 sometimes yes. The generally no is that once the 
 16 defendant has been indicted, the right to counsel 
 17 provides a -- a direction to the police not to 
 18 interfere with or circumvent the right to counsel.
 19 QUESTION: Well, what is the sometimes 
 20 yes?
 21 MR. DREEBEN: Sometimes yes is that, this 
 22 Court has recognized in its seminal case in this 
 23 area, the Massiah case, and then again in Maine v. 
 24 Moulton, that the Sixth Amendment, as it is 
 25 offense-specific, does not preclude the police from 

35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 investigating ongoing criminal activity that's not 
 2 charged.
 3 QUESTION: Well, but this is -- this was 
 4 an offense-specific interrogation if it -- if was an 
 5 interrogation.
 6 MR. DREEBEN: Yes. I -- and this case 
 7 doesn't involve the --
 8 QUESTION: It seems to me there's an 
 9 analogy to civil cases here. Supposing you just had 
 10 a civil lawsuit pending against the person and after 
 11 it's filed, wouldn't there be an ethical obligation 
 12 on -- on behalf of the plaintiff not to send agents 
 13 out to question your adversary in the proceeding?
 14 MR. DREEBEN: There may be a ethical 
 15 obligation, even if the party is not known to be 
 16 represented at the time, although --
 17 QUESTION: If he's known not to be 
 18 represented, that's my case.
 19 MR. DREEBEN: He's known not be 
 20 represented, I think it's a closer question whether 
 21 -- whether the ethics rules would -- would bar the 
 22 approaching of the defendant. But this Court has 
 23 made --
 24 QUESTION: Who -- who -- who would you go 
 25 to? If he hasn't appointed counsel and --

36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Stevens --
 2 QUESTION: -- and he's filed the case --
 3 he's filed the case pro se. Who would you approach 
 4 if you don't approach him?
 5 MR. DREEBEN: I think, Justice Stevens --
 6 QUESTION: Now, I'm assuming that the --
 7 the Government is the plaintiff in the case. That --
 8 MR. DREEBEN: The implication is that you 
 9 couldn't approach him. And this Court has clearly 
 10 made it evident that whatever the ethical rules might 
 11 be with respect to private conduct, the Sixth 
 12 Amendment rules are not governed by them. And the 
 13 Sixth Amendment rule, in this area at least, is 
 14 relatively clear. The police can approach an 
 15 unrepresented defendant, advise him of his rights, 
 16 and obtain a waiver of the right to counsel.
 17 QUESTION: Well, can the police approach a 
 18 person and deliberately elicit statements without 
 19 advising him of his right to counsel after 
 20 indictment?
 21 MR. DREEBEN: Not on the charged offense, 
 22 Justice O'Connor, and have the information admitted 
 23 at trial. The -- the threshold question --
 24 QUESTION: Well, have we looked to whether 
 25 the statement was deliberately elicited? Has that 

37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 been our understanding of what we'd look to?
 2 MR. DREEBEN: That -- that has been the 
 3 way that this Court has formulated the test, and I 
 4 would suggest that if --
 5 QUESTION: And so should we apply that 
 6 test here to those early statements?
 7 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, but I think the Court 
 8 should clearly reformulate it to make it in the 
 9 context of overt interrogation by the police, known 
 10 police officers, to be an objective test. The 
 11 deliberate elicitation standard, as so phrased, gives 
 12 rise to some confusion, because it does suggest that 
 13 there's a subjective component to it, where 
 14 deliberate elicitation does have a different 
 15 application than interrogation for purposes of 
 16 Miranda with respect to undercover agents. The Court 
 17 has made clear that once a suspect is indicted, the 
 18 police cannot use an undercover agent, not known or 
 19 identified as such to the defendant, to circumvent 
 20 his right to counsel. And in that respect, 
 21 deliberate elicitation is broader.
 22 But in footnote 12 of Maine v. Moulton 
 23 where the Court was discussing deliberate elicitation 
 24 in some detail, the Court made clear that intent is 
 25 hard to prove, and it's really not the main issue 

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 here anyway. What we should be interested in is 
 2 whether the Government must have known that its 
 3 conduct would be likely to elicit incriminating 
 4 statements, and that is essentially the same as the 
 5 Rhode Island v. Innis standard for interrogation. In 
 6 fact, it's a little bit more onerous for the 
 7 defendant, because it says, must have known, and the 
 8 Rhode Island v. Innis standard is should have known.
 9 In any event, the Government submits that 
 10 the Court should make it clearer that when you're 
 11 dealing with identified police officers interacting 
 12 with suspects post-indictment, the Rhode Island v. 
 13 Innis standard, the objective test should be the 
 14 definition of deliberate elicitation. Then the 
 15 question becomes, was there deliberate elicitation on 
 16 the record in this case?
 17 What happened is, the officers arrived at 
 18 petitioner's home. The officers knew petitioner. 
 19 This was not somebody that they had never met before. 
 20 They'd met him on prior occasions. And they said in 
 21 one continuous statement, we're here to discuss your 
 22 methamphetamine activities, we have a warrant for 
 23 your arrest --
 24 QUESTION: Didn't they say, we're here to 
 25 discuss with you?

39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DREEBEN: Justice --
 2 QUESTION: Wasn't it Bliemeister's 
 3 statement, I'm here to discuss with you?
 4 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, on three 
 5 occasions when Officer Bliemeister was asked to say 
 6 what he said in his own words, he said, we're here to 
 7 discuss your methamphetamine activities. On one 
 8 occasion, when defense counsel in cross-examination 
 9 reformulated what Officer Bliemeister said, and said, 
 10 didn't you say you're here to discuss with petitioner 
 11 his methamphetamine activities, Officer Bliemeister 
 12 answered yes. Both the magistrate judge and the 
 13 district court did not use the with you language in 
 14 describing what the officer said.
 15 And to the extent that this case turns on 
 16 a rather subtle distinction in language, I think the 
 17 distinction is relevant, because what the officers 
 18 were essentially doing is introducing the topic of 
 19 what they were going to tell petitioner, namely, your 
 20 methamphetamine activities have landed you in 
 21 trouble, we're here to arrest you, we have an 
 22 indictment for your arrest. And then petitioner 
 23 began to speak primarily --
 24 QUESTION: Telling -- telling is not 
 25 discussing. I mean, I don't see why the phrase, with 

40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 you, is essential when the only person in the room is 
 2 -- is -- is you --
 3 (Laughter.)
 4 QUESTION: -- and somebody comes in and 
 5 says, I'm here to discuss, you know, whatever. Who 
 6 else are you going to discuss it with then?
 7 (Laughter.)
 8 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think there was any 
 9 ambiguity about the object of the statements, but the 
 10 question of what the officers were intending to do is 
 11 somewhat informed by the way they phrased it.
 12 QUESTION: No, but the -- the usual sense 
 13 of the word discuss is something that involves other 
 14 than -- something involving more than a monologue. 
 15 So I mean, I -- as Justice Scalia said, I -- it might 
 16 make it clearer if he had said with you each time, 
 17 but without the with you, discuss implies give and 
 18 take.
 19 QUESTION: At -- at least if there's nobody 
 20 else in the room. I mean, if there's a crowd of 
 21 people and you say, I'm here to discuss something, 
 22 maybe you're going to discuss it with the other 
 23 people. That's fine, but -- but it -- this was 
 24 one-one-one.
 25 MR. DREEBEN: I readily acknowledge that 

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 this is a case that could be reasonably decided more 
 2 than one way, but I would submit that if you look at 
 3 what the officers did, the officers in the -- at his 
 4 home, basically informed him about the fact that he 
 5 was under arrest and indicted. He spoke 
 6 uninterrupted except by one completely irrelevant 
 7 question to the topic of the indictment, until the 
 8 officers interrupted him, cut him off, and said it's 
 9 time to go, John, you know. And John said, can I 
 10 please get some shoes on? And they accompanied him 
 11 downstairs, he got shoes, then they took him down to 
 12 the jailhouse. No questions about the topics that 
 13 were later discussed at the jailhouse.
 14 QUESTION: Well, if we were to conclude 
 15 that there was a violation of the so-called 
 16 deliberate elicitation standard, modified or not, 
 17 then what, with regard to the subsequent conversation 
 18 of the jail, after the warnings had been given?
 19 MR. DREEBEN: Then I think, Justice 
 20 O'Connor, that this Court should apply its rule in 
 21 Oregon v. Elstad that the knowing, voluntary, and 
 22 intelligent waiver of the right to counsel 
 23 constitutes an independent act of free will that 
 24 breaks any causal link that might otherwise have been 
 25 posited between the statements that were made in the 

42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 initial unwarned session --
 2 QUESTION: And you think that that 
 3 determination has been made knowing and voluntariness 
 4 as to the jailhouse statement --
 5 MR. DREEBEN: I --
 6 QUESTION: -- by the court below.
 7 MR. DREEBEN: Not only do I think that it 
 8 was made explicitly in the district court and 
 9 implicitly in the court of appeals, but I don't 
 10 believe that petitioner contests it. I don't believe 
 11 that petitioner's position is that the waiver of 
 12 rights was actually tainted. What I understand 
 13 petitioner's position to be is that there was a 
 14 violation of a primary constitutional norm at home 
 15 when -- when petitioner was interrogated or 
 16 statements were deliberately elicited. Accordingly 
 17 -18 QUESTION: The fruits --
 19 MR. DREEBEN: Exactly. The same fruits 
 20 rule ought to apply that applies under the Fourth 
 21 Amendment and then petitioner relies on Fourth 
 22 Amendment precedents, which the Government does not 
 23 think are -- are applicable here.
 24 QUESTION: I - I think -- I think he would 
 25 say it is a fruit because it is not totally 

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 voluntary, given the fact that he had already let the 
 2 cat out of the bag. I -- I -- I don't think -- I 
 3 don't think he would acknowledge that the second 
 4 waiver -- that the waiver of counsel in the second 
 5 interrogation was entirely free, given what had 
 6 preceded.
 7 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia, I'll 
 8 have to let petitioner's briefs speak for what --
 9 QUESTION: Well, we -- we've destroyed his 
 10 right of rebuttal, so --
 11 (Laughter.)
 12 QUESTION: And that's the question 
 13 basically, because I think that's an important 
 14 question and -- and the question is whether there is 
 15 a right to a lawyer, and when the Government violates 
 16 the right to the lawyer, like the Fourth Amendment or 
 17 any other amendment, they can't use a fruit. Now, 
 18 Oregon v. Elstad is talking about a right that isn't 
 19 complete until you fail to introduce the -- until you 
 20 use it as testimony at trial, and therefore Oregon v. 
 21 Elstad is a different, and considerably more lenient 
 22 test. I confess I always would have thought until 
 23 this moment that our Court cases said you apply the 
 24 fruits because the violation is complete. 
 25 Now, it seems to me in advocating the 

44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 second, you're advocating a considerable change, but 
 2 whether it's a change or not a change, I want to know 
 3 the reason for it.
 4 MR. DREEBEN: There are two critical 
 5 reasons, Justice Breyer, why Oregon v. Elstad should 
 6 apply in this context. The first is that the right 
 7 that the defendant did not get, by hypothesis now, at 
 8 home, was the right to make an informed waiver of the 
 9 right to counsel. When the defendant got the Miranda 
 10 warnings at home, that fully cured any deficiency in 
 11 knowledge that the defendant previously had about his 
 12 right to counsel, and enabled him to make an act of 
 13 free will that broke any causal link between the 
 14 first statements and the second statements.
 15 And the second crucial reason why Elstad 
 16 should apply here is Elstad is not simply limited to 
 17 reasoning that is only applicable in the context of 
 18 compulsion under the Fifth Amendment. It also 
 19 clearly and explicitly said, it's very speculative 
 20 and attenuated to posit that a defendant who spoke at 
 21 one time is therefore going to believe that the cat 
 22 is out of the bag and I should speak again, I don't 
 23 really have a choice.
 24 QUESTION: Right. But as to the first, my 
 25 Constitution says you have a right to a lawyer, not 

45
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 -- of course you can waive it, like anybody -- other 
 2 right. But that's quite different than the Fifth 
 3 Amendment right, which is a right not to testify 
 4 against yourself, which is in complete to a trial. 
 5 As to the second, of course, attenuation 
 6 is relevant. It's relevant under the tree -- fruits 
 7 doctrine. It's relevant under Elstad. So if you 
 8 prove attenuation, fine. So, given those two things, 
 9 why do we have to change the law here? Or is it a 
 10 change?
 11 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think it's a 
 12 change, Justice Breyer, because the Court has never 
 13 addressed the specific dynamic involved in this case 
 14 under the Sixth Amendment of a defendant who makes an 
 15 unwarned statement --
 16 QUESTION: Well, the Nix v. Williams case 
 17 bears on it to some extent, doesn't it?
 18 MR. DREEBEN: It does --
 19 QUESTION: That was a Sixth Amendment 
 20 case.
 21 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice O'Connor, and I 
 22 -- I accept, although I think it's fair to say that 
 23 Nix did no more than assume that there would be a 
 24 fruits rule as to physical evidence.
 25 QUESTION: Yeah. And the Court in Nix 

46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 made it pretty clear that we assumed there would be a 
 2 fruits suppression.
 3 MR. DREEBEN: Correct. As to physical 
 4 evidence.
 5 QUESTION: But applied some other reason 
 6 to let the body --
 7 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the Court -- the Court 
 8 there relied on inevitable discovery.
 9 QUESTION: Right.
 10 MR. DREEBEN: Here, our basic position is 
 11 that the voluntary testimony of the defendant himself 
 12 is different from physical fruits or from the 
 13 situation involving a tainted line-up, which was 
 14 involved in Wade, and that the decision, made 
 15 voluntarily and intelligently by a defendant to waive 
 16 counsel, is a per se break in any causal chain that 
 17 would be positive.
 18 And our second argument is that the Court 
 19 has already rejected in Elstad the idea that there is 
 20 a causal link between a defendant's letting a cat out 
 21 of the bag in the first statement and then being 
 22 confronted with the question whether to waive his 
 23 rights in the second.
 24 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, do -- do I 
 25 understand correctly that essentially you are saying 

47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that Mr. Waxman in wrong in bracketing the Sixth 
 2 Amendment with the Fourth Amendment, that it belongs 
 3 with the Fifth Amendment? And one, it seems to me, 
 4 large difference between the two of you is Mr. Waxman 
 5 describes the Sixth Amendment violation of -- as 
 6 occurring on the spot. You have said in your brief 
 7 it's just like the Fifth Amendment. It's sort of 
 8 inchoate until the Government seeks to introduce it 
 9 at a trial. Is that still your view, so that the --
 10 the right to counsel isn't complete -- the violation 
 11 isn't complete until the Government makes an effort 
 12 to introduce it at trial?
 13 MR. DREEBEN: It is. My view that the 
 14 violation is not complete until the evidence is 
 15 introduced at trial, but I think where I put the 
 16 Sixth Amendment is not numerically accurate, but it's 
 17 somewhere in between the Fourth and the Fifth 
 18 Amendment rules, in that there are circumstances in 
 19 which I believe that there is a fruits rule attached 
 20 to conduct that infringes a Sixth Amendment norm. 
 21 The right itself may not be a completed violation 
 22 until evidence that results from infringing a Sixth 
 23 Amendment norm is actually used against the 
 24 defendant. Adversarial fairness is the goal of the 
 25 Sixth Amendment. If it is not infringed, neither is 

48
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the Constitution.
 2 QUESTION: Because if -- if the -- we 
 3 describe that right, that Sixth Amendment amendment 
 4 right as a right to counsel at every critical stage 
 5 in the criminal proceeding, then that sounds like 
 6 there's a critical stage and you haven't been told 
 7 and haven't waived your right to a lawyer, the 
 8 violation is complete.
 9 MR. DREEBEN: No, I don't think so, 
 10 Justice Ginsburg. And one example that I think makes 
 11 the point very clear is this Court's ineffective 
 12 assistance of counsel cases. Those cases require not 
 13 only that a lawyer performs deficiently, below any 
 14 reasonable professional standard, but also that there 
 15 be an effect on the fairness of the trail in the form 
 16 of prejudice. It's a two-part standard. There is no 
 17 constitutional violation merely by interfering with 
 18 the right to counsel. Another case that makes that 
 19 point --
 20 QUESTION: Well, there's a constitutional 
 21 deficiency. I mean, we're playing with words. What 
 22 we're saying in the counsel cases is, if we have to 
 23 go back and unring the bell, we want something more 
 24 than simply the deficiency. We want to know that 
 25 requiring a new trial or whatever is likely to make a 

49
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 difference.
 2 The question here is -- is asked, I think, 
 3 Justice Ginsburg's question is asked on a prospective 
 4 basis. And that is, at the time the -- the police 
 5 question without counsel, is that a violation of the 
 6 -- of the Sixth Amendment?
 7 MR. DREEBEN: And my --
 8 QUESTION: Your -- your answer a moment 
 9 ago was, the only violation of the Sixth Amendment 
 10 was the denial of the -- of the opportunity to waive. 
 11 But he's got to have an opportunity to waive 
 12 something, and I suppose that implies that he has, at 
 13 least on a prospective basis, a right to the presence 
 14 of counsel there if the police are going to question 
 15 him, absent a -- a waiver.
 16 MR. DREEBEN: I -- I think that there's a 
 17 lot in your question, Justice Souter, but I -- I 
 18 think I basically agree with the thrust of it. He 
 19 does have the right to choose whether to have counsel 
 20 or not after he's been indicted when the police 
 21 approach him for interrogation. The question in this 
 22 case is, what do you do if that didn't happen? And 
 23 -24 QUESTION: Of course, the -- the other way 
 25 to look at is upside down. I mean, if -- if you 

50
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 concede that there's a Sixth Amendment violation 
 2 immediately, you're still free to argue that -- that 
 3 in -- in the Miranda case, there's also a Fifth 
 4 Amendment violation immediately. Now, you couldn't 
 5 do that with Elstad, but after Dickerson, you can 
 6 certainly argue that.
 7 MR. DREEBEN: Well, as we discussed 
 8 yesterday, Justice Scalia --
 9 QUESTION: Yes, I know.
 10 MR. DREEBEN: I -- I believe that the 
 11 violation in a Miranda case consists precisely of the 
 12 admission of the defendant's statements in the 
 13 Government case in chief. The Fifth Amendment is an 
 14 evidentiary rule. That's what the nature of the 
 15 violation is. It's not a conduct-based rule.
 16 QUESTION: Well, and that has a textual 
 17 support in the constitutional language itself.
 18 MR. DREEBEN: That -- that's correct.
 19 QUESTION: But you don't have quite the 
 20 same thing on the Sixth Amendment?
 21 MR. DREEBEN: No, but I don't think that 
 22 it matters because we're conceding that the Court 
 23 engages in fruits analysis. Our primary position in 
 24 this case on the legal issue is that the defendant's 
 25 independent, untainted decision to waive counsel is a 

51
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 act of --
 2 QUESTION: But Mr. Dreeben, it's -- the 
 3 thought runs through my mind that if he were to waive 
 4 counsel in front of a judge in a trial setting, the 
 5 judge would ask him a lot of questions and be sure 
 6 the waiver was intelligent and voluntary and so 
 7 forth. And you're suggesting, at the time he's first 
 8 indicted when the police approach him, he doesn't 
 9 need any of that guidance as all. If he just answers 
 10 the question, that's sufficient.
 11 MR. DREEBEN: Well, that -- that is --
 12 QUESTION: It's a rather dramatic 
 13 difference in the kind of waiver of this very 
 14 important right.
 15 MR. DREEBEN: True. But that's what the 
 16 Court held over Your Honor's dissent in Patterson v. 
 17 Illinois. The Court explicitly considered the issue 
 18 of what kind of a waiver is necessary, and the Court 
 19 held that the issuance of Miranda warnings provides 
 20 the defendant with all the information that he needs 
 21 to know.
 22 QUESTION: But, of course, you didn't even 
 23 have the Miranda warning here --
 24 MR. DREEBEN: No, but --
 25 QUESTION: -- at the home.

52
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DREEBEN: And we're not claiming that 
 2 there was a waiver of the right to counsel. Our --
 3 our claim for whatever favor it may meet with the 
 4 Court is that there was no deliberate elicitation of 
 5 statements. We're not claiming a waiver at the home. 
 6 We are unequivocally claiming a waiver at the 
 7 jailhouse.
 8 QUESTION: Don't you think it is a rather 
 9 -- rather strange that the judges are as careful as 
 10 they are in a trial setting, whereas the police can 
 11 just do what they did here? Does that -- doesn't 
 12 trouble you?
 13 MR. DREEBEN: No, I don't think it's 
 14 strange at all, because as the Court explained in 
 15 Patterson, the question of a waiver is a functional 
 16 question that turns on what the role of counsel might 
 17 be at a particular setting. Now, the role of counsel 
 18 at trial is considerably more complex in dealing with 
 19 evidentiary matters and legal claims than the role in 
 20 pre-trial interrogation.
 21 QUESTION: Actually, in -- in a situation 
 22 like this, the whole outcome of the proceeding is 
 23 determined by what happened in his home.
 24 MR. DREEBEN: Well, in this particular 
 25 case, and this is my third and final point, if the 

53
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Court should determine that the waiver of rights is 
 2 not a per se independent act that attenuates any 
 3 taint, on any record the Court should not find that 
 4 there is any taint that is unattenuated. The 
 5 violation at home, if there was any, was an extremely 
 6 mild violation. If the defendant let the cat out of 
 7 the bag, it was really at most one paw, not an entire 
 8 cat.
 9 (Laughter.)
 10 MR. DREEBEN: The -- the defendant barely 
 11 spoke at all about his activities relating to the 
 12 charges that were identified in the indictment. He 
 13 said that he had business and personal problems and 
 14 he was a methamphetamine user, and he rambled on for 
 15 a while until the police cut him off. At the station 
 16 house, he was asked specifically person by person 
 17 what his relationship was with the individual and 
 18 what the activities were, and of course, he gave more 
 19 elaborate information at that time, but -- and this 
 20 is critical too. It was not information that 
 21 admitted the charges in the indictment. This wasn't 
 22 a case where a defendant said, well, I've confessed 
 23 once, I might as well confess again now that I have 
 24 my Miranda warning. This was an individual who spoke 
 25 about his problems at his home, then he gets down to 

54
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the station house and he's essentially talking about 
 2 all the things that make him not liable, criminally 
 3 liable under the indictment. 
 4 It was an instance in which, I would 
 5 submit, the motive for the defendant to talk was not 
 6 that the cat was out of the bag, but that he was 
 7 hoping to minimize any suggestion of guilt and 
 8 persuade the officers that the indictment was not 
 9 properly founded.
 10 And finally, of course, the officers never 
 11 exploited any prior statement and they did give him a 
 12 thorough, complete administration of Miranda 
 13 warnings, and under the circumstances of this case, 
 14 even if the Court were to apply a taint analysis 
 15 sometimes, or to assume that a taint analysis 
 16 applies, the facts of this case demonstrate enough 
 17 attenuation so that the jailhouse statements should 
 18 be admitted, while the statements at home were 
 19 suppressed.
 20 QUESTION: Are -- are you arguing that the 
 21 fruits rule does not apply, or are you arguing that 
 22 this is not the fruits?
 23 MR. DREEBEN: I am arguing that a fruits 
 24 rule applies under the Sixth Amendment. I'm 
 25 conceding that by virtue of the Court's assumption in 

55
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Nix v. Williams and its holding in United States v. 
 2 Wade. But the case of a defendant's own voluntary 
 3 statements should be treated as a special case under 
 4 a fruits rule in which there is per se attenuation in 
 5 the form of an independent act of free will that 
 6 intervenes between the violation and the ensuing 
 7 waiver. And that comes about when the defendant 
 8 receives full and complete information about his 
 9 rights. There is no suggestion of involuntariness in 
 10 his waiver and he decides to speak.
 11 The ultimate test in attenuation law is 
 12 was there an independent act of free will when you're 
 13 speaking of a confession that breaks the causal link 
 14 to the prior illegality. Here, we submit as a matter 
 15 of law under Oregon v. Elstad's reasoning, there was.
 16 Thank you.
 17 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. 
 18 Dreeben. The case is submitted.

 20 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
