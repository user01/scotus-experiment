1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:08 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument this morning in Case 08-1457, New Process Steel 5 v. The National Labor Relations Board. 6 Mr. Richie. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHELDON E. RICHIE 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. RICHIE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 The issue in this case is whether the 12 National Labor Relations Board can continue to issue 13 adjudicatory decisions when its membership falls to two. 14 The National Labor Relations Act clearly states that at 15 all times, a quorum of the board will be not less than 16 three members. The board's interpretation - 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it your position that 18 all of the actions of the board, including those taken 19 by the regional offices and by the general counsel and 20 by everybody else, is inoperative once -- once the 21 membership falls below three? 22 MR. RICHIE: No, Justice Scalia, 23 particularly with respect to the general counsel, the 24 statute at 153(d) has a separate enumeration of -- of 25 obligations and powers and authority, so we don't think
3 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that that fails. 2 We also think that, with respect to certain 3 administrative type functions - 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it has a separate - 5 a separate authorization for these three -- three-person 6 adjudicatory panels as well, doesn't it? 7 MR. RICHIE: It has -- it does, 8 Justice Scalia. It does have a separate authorization 9 for panels of three or more members. It does not have, 10 as in this case, a separate authorization for panels of 11 two members. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. But that's a 13 different argument from the argument you were starting 14 off with, which, as I understood it, was once the 15 membership of the board falls below the quorum of three, 16 by reason of that, the three -- former three-member 17 panels, of which there are now only two left, cannot 18 act. Is that your argument? 19 MR. RICHIE: It is our argument that the - 20 that once the membership falls below three, that the 21 National Labor - 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: The membership of the 23 board? 24 MR. RICHIE: I'm sorry, Your Honor? 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: The membership of the
4 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 board? 2 MR. RICHIE: When the membership of the 3 board falls below three. But we also believe that when 4 the membership of the group falls below three, that the 5 delegee group's authority to make adjudicatory decisions 6 lapses. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understood that argument 8 and I thought that was the only one you were making. 9 But you are making a broader one, that it also happens 10 whenever the -- whenever the board's quorum disappears. 11 MR. RICHIE: You are correct, 12 Justice Scalia. We are making that argument. It's 13 because of the first sentence of 153(b), which states 14 that the delegations have to be to members of three or 15 more members. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the regional offices 17 can't function, of the NLRB? 18 MR. RICHIE: Well, we believe they can 19 function. They can receive, for example, unfair labor 20 practices complaints. They can't make adjudicatory 21 decisions. And we think that that is exactly what - 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can the board pay salaries? 23 MR. RICHIE: We believe they can, because 24 there is probably a different statute that enumerates 25 that, Justice Scalia, other than this statute with
5 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 respect to the authority with respect to adjudicatory 2 decisions. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm really reluctant to 4 rely upon this first argument that you are making, 5 because I really don't know what it does to all of the 6 functioning of the board. 7 MR. RICHIE: Well, one of the -8 Justice Scalia, one of the things that we think is clear 9 is that the remedy for fixing an undersized board is not 10 for the board to redefine itself and to read the 11 statute, but for Congress or the president to act. And 12 there are many ways in which the president and Congress 13 could -- could fix the problem of an undersized board. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But here the court of 15 appeals said that the Act does two things. First, it 16 said that the full board can delegate full powers to any 17 three-member group. That was step one, and that was 18 done here. 19 And then it says there's this rule that a 20 quorum is three, but then it said: Except as to one of 21 these three-member groups that has been designated, 22 except, and there the quorum is two. So why doesn't the 23 statute answer the question that, yes, a quorum is 24 three, except when it's two? 25 MR. RICHIE: Well, I think there is two
6 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 answers to that, Justice Ginsburg. One is here the 2 government -- the board takes the position, as they say 3 on page 29 in a footnote to their brief, that when a 4 delegate group possessed of all of the board's power 5 acts, it is acting as the board and not as an agent of 6 the board. 7 So first, we would say that the second 8 quorum provision isn't even applicable to this group 9 that was established -- of members Kirsanow, Liebman and 10 Schaumber. And so we think the three-member quorum - 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand that. 12 Would you -- would you make that argument again? 13 MR. RICHIE: Certainly, Justice Scalia. The 14 government -- I'm sorry, "the government." The NLRB in 15 its brief in footnote 21 on page 29, as well as in the 16 delegation, the minutes of the delegation in 2007, which 17 are found in our brief in the appendix on -- I think 18 it's pages 4a and 5a. Both say that when -- the NLRB 19 says in the footnote "When the delegee group possessed 20 of all of the board's powers," which is what we have 21 here, "acts, it is acting as the board and not as an 22 agent of the board. So our position is that when you 23 become the board, as this group did, now you are subject 24 to that minimum three-member delegee -- three member 25 quorum requirement.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not an agent of 2 the board because the three-member group that has a 3 quorum of two has the full powers of the board. So the 4 statute doesn't say anything about a three-member group 5 that has a quorum of two being an agent of the board. 6 MR. RICHIE: It's a -- it's a group that is 7 delegated authority, and therefore, whether it's a full 8 delegation or partial delegation, we believe that the 9 common law principles of agency and principal make that 10 delegee group an agent. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But where does the 12 statute make that three-member group with a quorum of 13 two, a quorum of two, an agent? It says they may be 14 designated to exercise any and all powers? 15 MR. RICHIE: Justice Ginsburg, it does not 16 say the word "agent" in it. But the delegation that 17 it's referring to is at common law a principal-agency 18 relationship. So it's our position that once that 19 delegation occurs that the -- in a normal situation, 20 because you could have a three-member group of four 21 members, a board of four or a board of five, and you 22 could have a group with three members. When the 23 delegation is made, it's our position and we believe 24 that this is the position that the D.C. Circuit took as 25 well, that that's an agent of the board.

1 JUSTICE BREYER: You should -- you should 2 have a very direct answer to this question. 3 Were you finished, because I don't want to 4 interrupt that train of thought? 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The D.C. Circuit I think 6 was the source of your opening argument because they 7 said when the number drops below three there is no 8 board, and I guess that's what your opening argument was 9 based on. 10 MR. RICHIE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it did 11 say that. But it also went on to say that it was 12 applying the rules, the common law rules of principal 13 and agency, and that when the board without three 14 members lost its authority to act, that the delegee 15 group to which the delegation was made also lost 16 authority to act. And in this case that's exactly what 17 happened. We had a three-member board -- we actually 18 had four delegate to three, and then two terms expired. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just on this same 20 point before Justice Breyer I think moves to another 21 point. The statute does use the word "quorum" twice 22 and, as Justice Ginsburg has pointed out, except that 23 two members -- in its last phrase it uses the word 24 "quorum" twice: "Except that two members shall 25 constitute a quorum." It doesn't say two members may

1 act. 2 MR. RICHIE: Justice Kennedy - 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It says shall constitute a 4 quorum." 5 MR. RICHIE: Justice Kennedy, I think we 6 have to start first -- and you are correct, there are 7 two quorum provisions, but "quorum" is not defined 8 differently. Quorum -- I think we agree within NLRB 9 that a quorum is the minimum number of members of a body 10 necessary to transact business. We have two different 11 bodies defined in this statute. We have the board as 12 one body and we have the group as a different body. And 13 so when the -- when the exception appears in the 14 statute, we agree again with the D.C. Circuit's 15 interpretation of that as simply defining two different 16 numbers of people necessary to fill out a quorum of 17 these two different bodies that are defined within the 18 statute. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Can you -- can you -- if 20 you are right, it seems to me you should have a very 21 clear, concise answer to the question that I'm just 22 going to ask you. And this is the question: Imagine 23 that there was no delegation, none. Now we have five 24 members; is that right? One of them dies. So there is 25 a vacancy. Now, can the remaining four exercise the
10 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 board's power? 2 MR. RICHIE: Clearly. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: Clearly. Okay. So what is 4 the difference between the situation I just described 5 and this situation where the Board simply delegated its 6 power to three people and one of them dies? What's the 7 difference? I can't find any difference in the 8 language. So what is the difference? 9 MR. RICHIE: Justice Breyer, the difference 10 is that in this statute there is a clear statement that 11 at all times the board must have a three-member quorum. 12 In your hypothetical there were still four members. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: Correct. 14 MR. RICHIE: The board was still in place. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Except that two members 16 shall constitute a quorum of any group designated 17 pursuant to the first sentence, which says "The board is 18 authorized to delegate to any group of three all of the 19 powers which it may itself exercise. " So, what's the 20 difference? 21 MR. RICHIE: Well, the difference is that 22 once the -- the difference between the hypothetical and 23 the situation we are in is that there were four members, 24 and the statute - 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I know that, but I'm
11 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 asking why does that make a difference? 2 MR. RICHIE: It makes a difference because 3 the statute requires that at all times the board shall 4 have a quorum of three members, a minimum quorum of 5 three members. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Except. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't that tied to a 8 quorum for the board as a whole to act? Once it's 9 delegated a responsibility to a three-member board, it's 10 already said, unless it takes another vote, that it's 11 going to let those three people decide. It has -- I 12 understand the word "delegated" to mean it's given over 13 its power to a subgroup. If it wants to take it back, 14 it needs a quorum to do that. That's what I understand. 15 MR. RICHIE: Well, I think the problem is, 16 Justice Sotomayor, that the delegation to a group of 17 three is indeed a valid delegation. We don't contest 18 that. But what we have here is a phantom group. And 19 what the -- what the board said, because member 20 Kirsanow's term expired in December, about 11 days after 21 the delegation. And if you look at the minutes of the 22 board when they are delegating to the group, it says in 23 the minutes that they "are continuing to be a two-member 24 quorum of a three-member group," as if member Kirsanow 25 is a phantom . It's a fiction. The group ceases to

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 exist and the board -- it's not just that the board 2 falls below three and the board ceases to exist with all 3 delegated powers to this group. The group ceases to 4 exist. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that brings you back 6 to Justice Breyer's hypothetical. There's five members 7 on the board. Clearly they can delegate under the 8 statute. Now there are only four members. Something 9 happens to the fifth. Under your theory, the entity 10 that originally delegated no longer exists and therefore 11 the group, the entity that received the delegation of 12 powers, must cease, must cease to act. 13 MR. RICHIE: Justice Kennedy, I - 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the quorum of three 15 that authorized two to act disappears and that means the 16 principal is no longer there, so the agent can't 17 exercise the authority, why isn't it the same when five 18 become four? 19 MR. RICHIE: Well, we believe that the 20 reason that it isn't, Justice Kennedy, the same is - 21 terrible sentence. It's not the same because the 22 statute contemplates vacancies on the board and multiple 23 vacancies, so long as they don't go below three. The 24 statute -- the vacancy clause in the statute doesn't 25 apply to a group at all. So the delegating group in the
13 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 hypothetical clearly is still in place as the board 2 because it's the board that delegated. And the board 3 still exists. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: As far as the interests of 5 your client are concerned, is there any functional 6 difference between what happened here and what could 7 happen very routinely even if the board had five 8 members, namely that after the case was assigned to a 9 three-member panel one of the three members of the panel 10 became unable to sit on that case, but the remaining two 11 members were able to reach agreement so the case could 12 be decided? 13 MR. RICHIE: Justice Alito, the difference 14 is that here there was never a way to reconstitute this 15 board -- I'm sorry, the group -- as three members. When 16 you have five or you have four members of the board and 17 a member of a three-member group is unable to perform 18 his or her function - 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't there another 20 difference? Is it not the case that the decisions of 21 these panels can be appealed to the full board? Are 22 they automatically final? Can the board not revise the 23 decision of one of its panels? 24 MR. RICHIE: Well, I believe that the board 25 could revise the decision of one of its panels.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: You've got to tell me more 2 than you believe it. What is the case? 3 MR. RICHIE: The adjudication is final. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: The adjudication is final. 5 MR. RICHIE: Of the three-member group. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is no appeal to the 7 full board? 8 MR. RICHIE: That is correct. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Then what is the reason -10 I now see. Your answer to my question is that the 11 vacancy clause applies to the full board but not to the 12 group. 13 MR. RICHIE: That's correct, Justice Breyer. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, got that 15 answer. And now I see how you could read the statute 16 that way. So, now I would like -- and that would be in 17 your favor. 18 MR. RICHIE: That's true. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and, therefore, I 20 would like to know, since you could also read it the 21 other way, why should it be read your way? I mean, I 22 can think of a lot of reasons why not. One is something 23 that Justice Scalia was raising: It may work havoc as 24 to what remains effective, what doesn't, what about the 25 board staff decisions, which are, which aren't. I can
15 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 see a lot of reasons for not doing it. 2 But what are your best reasons for reading 3 that vacancy clause the way you want me to read it? 4 MR. RICHIE: Justice Breyer, we -- we 5 believe that it is important to have a promote -- to 6 have a robust debate and an expression of -- a potential 7 for expression of dissent. And what you have here is 8 you have two members in a group and -- who have publicly 9 announced that on more than one occasion over the last 2 10 years plus 3 months when this board has sat with only 2 11 members, that they have sometimes compromised their 12 opinions in the interest of the institutional purposes, 13 basically to keep the doors open. 14 And so you don't have a full and robust 15 debate. You don't have the potential for an expression 16 of a dissenting view, and that's the -- that's the 17 distinction that we see. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the problem is that 19 that exists whether we read your rule or not in the way 20 you want. You have -- you've conceded that a 21 three-member board could lose a member, a three-member 22 group could lose a member and its acts still be binding, 23 as long as you say there is -- there is three members on 24 the full board. But this lack of opportunity for 25 dissent exists any time there is a vacancy. You just
16 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 don't like the system. 2 MR. RICHIE: Justice Sotomayor, if we 3 consented that when there was an absence, a member who 4 dies, retires, is incapacitated, that the two members of 5 a properly constituted three -- three-member group could 6 still function, I certainly did not mean to say that. 7 We do not consent to that or agree with that 8 proposition. What -- what somebody - 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You are now 10 saying that the group always has to be three members? 11 MR. RICHIE: Yes. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That somebody can't die, 13 leave, recuse themselves from that group without 14 invalidating the actions of that subgroup. Where in the 15 statute do you read that limitation when it says a 16 quorum of two is okay to act? 17 MR. RICHIE: The definition of a quorum, 18 Justice Sotomayor, is the minimum number of persons of a 19 body necessary to transact business. The body here is 20 defined as three or more people. So, when the - 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I am talking about 22 the group. 23 MR. RICHIE: I am, too. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the group is not 25 defined as three or more people. It's defined as three.
17 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 The board is defined as three or more. The group is 2 defined as three. So I'm -- I'm a little confused. 3 MR. RICHIE: In the statute, the group is 4 defined as -- the board is authorized, and I'm reading 5 from 153(b), Appendix 1a to our brief: "The board is 6 authorized to delegate to any group of three or more 7 members" - 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I see. 9 MR. RICHIE: -- "any or all" -- that is 10 where we find it necessary that the group must contain 11 at least three members. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's a totally 13 different argument from the one that relies upon the 14 size of the board, right? 15 MR. RICHIE: It is, and we think it's an 16 additional argument. We think there's multiple - 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even if the board were 18 still properly constituted and had a full five members, 19 if one of the three members to a -- a board should die, 20 it would no longer be a three-member board and could no 21 longer be, as your argument goes, the recipient of the 22 delegation, right? 23 MR. RICHIE: That's correct, Justice Scalia. 24 But what's happened routinely for -- for 60 years since 25 1947 when Taft-Hartley was passed, is that what the
18 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 board did was it reconstituted the panels any time a 2 member died or retired. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There have been 4 situations before where the board dwindled to two 5 members. Is this the first time that the board has 6 continued to adjudicate the cases that they can, or when 7 there were prior periods with only two did the board 8 continue to adjudicate? 9 MR. RICHIE: This is the first time, yes. 10 For over -- from 1947 through 19 -- up to 2007, any time 11 the board fell to two members -- as far as we know, any 12 time the board fell to two members, the board 13 reconstituted -- I'm sorry. Any time a group fell to 14 two members, the board reconstituted the group to a 15 three-member group. 16 JUSTICE ALITO: There is a well-established 17 practice on the court of appeals that when a three-judge 18 panel for some reason loses one of the members due to a 19 death or resignation or recusal, the panel can continue 20 to decide the case if the remaining two judges can 21 agree. And -- and do you see -- do you think the -- the 22 situation is different with the NLRB for some reason? 23 Or do you think that that -- that those decisions on the 24 courts of appeals are unlawful as well? 25 MR. RICHIE: Well, Justice Alito, I think
19 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 it's a different statute. But we also -- I also think 2 the court of appeals, which is the delegating body that 3 forms the -- the three-member courts, still is in 4 existence. And if we just - 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you are shifting 6 arguments. You can't keep jumping back and forth 7 between the two arguments. The one is that the 8 appointing body has to still be fully constituted, or at 9 least have a quorum, and the other one, which I thought 10 Justice Alito was addressing, is the quite separate 11 argument that the recipient of the delegation has to be 12 three. And when it falls below three it's only two. 13 And I don't know that you have a response 14 to -- to -- to his point, with respect to the latter 15 argument, except -- except that it's a different 16 statute. 17 MR. RICHIE: Well, Justice Scalia, it's a 18 different statute but it's also a very temporary and 19 limited circumstance. You have a panel that was formed 20 to hear a case. Here you have got a delegation of all 21 the authority, the board has -- the group has become the 22 board, and we effectively have a two-member National 23 Labor Relations Board. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: So I would have thought, 25 but this is only me -- other people don't necessarily go
20 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 in for this kind of argument. But in thinking of the - 2 the -- the arguments in your favor, the one that sort of 3 resonated a bit with me was that this is a very 4 Republican Congress in 1947 that passed Taft-Hartley, 5 and one of the things they were really aiming at was to 6 move the board from three to five. And this is a way so 7 that that just doesn't happen. 8 But I assume from the briefs filed that 9 there is no supporting legislative history for that, 10 what I've just said, so I better wipe it out of my mind. 11 (Laughter.) 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: If there is no legislative 13 history, it could be true. 14 (Laughter.) 15 MR. RICHIE: Justice Breyer, the legislative 16 history I think is -- there is no legislative history on 17 what happens when the board falls below two members. 18 But it is clear that from 1935 to 1947, the board was 19 made up of three members, and the statute clearly said 20 under the Wagner Act two members could be a quorum of a 21 three-member board. 22 In 1947 when Taft-Hartley was passed, 23 Congress intentionally increased the quorum and 24 increased the size of the board. If it had intended to 25 have only two members serve at any time as a two-member
21 Alderson Reporting Company

1 board, they would not -- that would be a strange way to 2 do it, in a statute that not only increases the size of 3 the board, but changes the minimum quorum requirement 4 from two to three. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: I was surprised by your 6 answer to -- I was surprised by your answer to one of 7 the earlier questions, because one of your amici says 8 that any member of the board, regardless of whether he 9 or she sits on the panel hearing a case, may request 10 that the case be heard by all five board members. Is 11 that -- is that not correct? 12 MR. RICHIE: That is correct, but that's to 13 hear it as opposed to overturn it once the decision is 14 made. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Heard an initial -- an 16 initial decision. But just -- the review of the panel 17 is in the court of appeals, right? 18 MR. RICHIE: That's correct, 19 Justice Ginsburg. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you could have 21 initially a panel of five, but that would not be 22 reviewing the panel of three? 23 MR. RICHIE: That's correct, 24 Justice Ginsburg. The -- the -- the five-member board 25 would not review the three-member group's decision. But

RICHIE: What was - 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you have a -- you are 7 changing, oh, we had a three-member board, that's no 8 good, we thought that's unfair. We are going to make to 9 five. But then we allow the five to convert themselves 10 to three for finally deciding all the cases. What - 11 what has been accomplished? 12 MR. RICHIE: Multiple - 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Nothing. 14 MR. RICHIE: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia. 15 Multiple members of three. And so before 16 you had a -- a -- without a delegation, you had a group 17 of three members. They could -- that group could 18 hear -- or board - 19 JUSTICE ALITO: The amicus says that the 20 members of the board not serving on a panel are given 21 the opportunity to review draft decisions, thus no case 22 will issue unless it reflects the majority opinion of 23 the full board. 24 MR. RICHIE: It's a draft - 25 JUSTICE ALITO: So that can be, in effect,

RICHIE: That's not - 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Only if a majority 8 of the board wants to do that, right? 9 MR. RICHIE: No, Mr. Chief Justice. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One member of the 11 full board can overturn a group delegation, in other 12 words, and hear the initial decision? 13 MR. RICHIE: No, Mr. Chief Justice. They 14 can agree to -- to review the decision and they can 15 agree before the decision is made to join the panel, 16 basically is what they do. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if one board 18 member wants to do that and four don't? What happens? 19 MR. RICHIE: One member wants to join the 20 panel? 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One member wants to 22 review the group's decision. 23 MR. RICHIE: That member would review the 24 group's decision. He wouldn't be able -- he or she 25 wouldn't be able to overturn the group's decision.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- I am really 2 confused now. 3 Is it or is it not the case that the full 4 board has the power to review a decision of one of these 5 panels? Before you said no; before you said it's final. 6 MR. RICHIE: The decision is final once it 7 is rendered. They can review the decision in draft form 8 before it is - 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that is -- that is my 10 question, whether they -- they can review it before it 11 is rendered, is that what you are saying? 12 MR. RICHIE: They can do that or they can 13 ask to be included on the -- on the panel. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: They can review it before 15 it is rendered. Okay. 16 MR. RICHIE: But they can't overturn it. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is this different from 18 the practice that some courts of appeals follow of 19 circulating a panel decision to the full court some days 20 before it's issued to the public? That doesn't put the 21 non-panel members on the panel. Is this practice that 22 you are describing the same or is it different? 23 MR. RICHIE: I believe it's the same, 24 Justice Ginsburg, that it's exactly the same. But - 25 but you have an additional opportunity -

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's quite 2 different from the court of appeals sitting en banc. 3 The practice of circulating the opinion does not put all 4 of the members of the court on the panel. 5 MR. RICHIE: That is correct, 6 Justice Ginsburg. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: But it provides an 8 opportunity for them to vote to hear the case en banc 9 before it's ever issued. 10 MR. RICHIE: That's correct, Justice Alito. 11 It does. And it -- and therefore you have what we don't 12 have here, is an opportunity for a robust debate. 13 If there are no other questions I would like 14 to reserve the remainder of my time. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 16 Mr. Katyal. 17 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL 18 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 19 MR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 20 and may it please the Court: 21 We agree that the plain text controls this 22 case and there are three features to that text. 23 First, section 153(b) permits delegation of 24 any or all of the board's power to three or more 25 members. Second, that section sets out a general quorum
26 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 rule of three members. And third, as Justices Alito -2 Justices Alito, Kennedy and Ginsburg have pointed out, 3 there is the phrase "except that" in the rule, a special 4 quorum provision that sets up panel quorums at two 5 members. 6 And in this case, faced with a vacancy 7 crisis, the board validly delegated its powers in 8 December 2007 to a three-member panel, and Petitioners 9 have never contested otherwise. Rather, they argue that 10 when the board dropped it down to two members - 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just before the third 12 member no longer became -- no longer was a member of the 13 board. 14 MR. KATYAL: That's true. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: So knowing when it gave it 16 to this three member panel that it would shortly become 17 a two-member panel, and that thereby the board would be 18 able to act with only two members instead of with three, 19 which is what the quorum requirement for the board is. 20 I must say that seems to be a very strange 21 procedure when you have a statute that says the board 22 has to -- has to have three for a quorum. When the 23 board sees, oh, God, we are about to lose our third 24 member, let's set up a three-member panel with this guy 25 who's about to go off. It will immediately become a
27 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 two-member panel and then we can act with only two 2 members. That's wonderful. 3 It doesn't seem to you like an evasion of 4 the whole purpose of the -- of the quorum requirement? 5 MR. KATYAL: I don't think so. I think it's 6 precisely what was -- what the text allows, because it's 7 not, Justice Scalia, simply a three-member quorum 8 requirement. It's a three-member quorum requirement, 9 "except that." 10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Except -- may I just 11 interrupt a bit, just on the "except" clause at the very 12 bottom. When you are talking about individual cases 13 it's easy. Sure, one member dies; the other two can 14 finish. But you are talking about long-run governance 15 of the board. The two members -- two members shall 16 constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to 17 the first sentence. 18 Now, 2 years later, after -- what is the 19 group designated pursuant to the first sentence at the 20 time of the decision 2 years later? 21 MR. KATYAL: It is the same group of people 22 that were - 23 JUSTICE STEVENS: But there is no such group 24 exists at the time that that power is being exercised. 25 MR. KATYAL: Well, Justice Stevens, the

1 language is written in the past tense. It's "any" - 2 the language in this is found in the government's brief 3 at 10a. 4 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, it's not the past 5 tense. "Two members shall constitute a quorum." 6 MR. KATYAL: "Of any group designated 7 pursuant to" the first sentence. 8 JUSTICE STEVENS: But there is no group 9 around at the time they're -- that this case is being 10 decided, that was designated before. 11 MR. KATYAL: That group was designated on 12 December 20, 2007, and that met the requirements of - 13 JUSTICE STEVENS: But your -- your inquiry 14 is focusing on what happens 2 years later. 15 MR. KATYAL: And -- and with respect to 2 16 years later, I submit to you that that penultimate 17 sentence in 153(b) is met. That is a designated group 18 pursuant to the first sentence. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't know how you 20 could write the sentence without the "ed" unless you 21 want to say -- to make your point, if the statute had 22 been written the other way, to any group continuously 23 being designated. 24 MR. KATYAL: Sure, I think you could say 25 something like constitute a -- that two members shall
29 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 constitute a quorum of any group that continues to meet 2 the requirements of the first sentence thereof, or 3 something like that. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: To read -- you can read the 5 language the way you want, that -- because of the 6 vacancy clause. You see, there is a sentence there that 7 says "A vacancy shall not impair the right of the 8 remaining members to exercise the power." That implies 9 in the absence of that clause, five to four, they 10 couldn't. Okay? 11 Now, you say that clause applies to the 12 remaining members, i.e., to the three. And now we don't 13 have three. And since we don't have three, there are - 14 and you have to have three. Because they're not - 15 there's not -- there are not the remaining members, you 16 see. 17 MR. KATYAL: Right. So let me say a few 18 things about that. The first is - 19 JUSTICE BREYER: As long as there was 20 another member, you could -- you could do it. But 21 without that remaining member, you can't. 22 MR. KATYAL: So the first thing to say about 23 that argument, Justice Breyer, and it's one that 24 Justice Scalia brought up to my friend before - 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
30 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. KATYAL: -- it is a totally different 2 argument. It really does rest on the first sentence of 3 153(b). 4 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes. 5 MR. KATYAL: And my friend admitted, it's a 6 totally new, different argument. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 8 MR. KATYAL: It's not in the question 9 presented. It's not before the Court. But were the 10 Court interested in it, I do think that the language of 11 the quorum provision, "quorum" meaning a number 12 sufficient to transact business, is the most relevant 13 language, and that suggests that two is enough so long 14 as you have that initial delegation to a group of three 15 and then one member drops off. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, don't -- don't you 17 think it is significant that the -- the vacancy clause 18 that you were discussing -- where is it? It's in (b). 19 "A vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of 20 the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of 21 the board." And it says nothing about a vacancy in the 22 group not impairing the power of the group. 23 MR. KATYAL: The -- the - 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which -- which buttresses, 25 it seems to me, the argument that when the group is no
31 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 longer a group of three the delegation is no longer 2 effective. 3 MR. KATYAL: I don't think so. The -- the 4 language is "A vacancy in the board -- in the board 5 shall not impair the powers of the remaining members of 6 the board." 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of the board. 8 MR. KATYAL: Of the board. And - 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't say that 10 about the group. That's my point. 11 MR. KATYAL: Well, but by definition, 12 Justice Scalia, the members that had been delegated this 13 power on December 20th are members of the board. And 14 they are not -- they are not simply extraneous actors. 15 And so the vacancy clause, I think - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. The -- this whole 17 passage distinguishes between the board and the group. 18 I mean, it's -- it doesn't -- it doesn't mean the group 19 when it says "the board" and the board when it says "the 20 group." 21 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think it -- I don't 22 know that there is a distinction. I think that there 23 when they say the board, it by definition includes the 24 group, because that is part of the board. They aren't 25 extraneous individuals.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, counsel, if I - 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, go ahead; 4 finish. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: The quorum for the group 6 should be three, then. Right? 7 MR. KATYAL: The quorum -- well, except 8 that, Justice Scalia, it says -- it goes on to say that 9 the quorum is actually two. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let -- let's say the 11 board delegates to a group the authority to act as the 12 board until December 31st, 2010. And on December 30th, 13 2010, the group delegates to itself because it's acting 14 as the board the authority to act until December 31, 15 2011. Is that valid? 16 MR. KATYAL: Well, if -- if the initial 17 delegation did give any and all of the powers to the - 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All the powers of 19 the board until December 31st. 20 MR. KATYAL: And then -- then I take it, 21 yes, they could exercise that delegation. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So a delegee can 23 delegate to itself the full authority of the -- the 24 master in the master -agent relationship? 25 MR. KATYAL: Under the statute. Now, there
33 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 may be other problems with it. So 153(a), which is 2 found in our brief, in our government brief at page 10a, 3 sets out, for example, removal for cause. And if some 4 members of a group were somehow - 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no; they are 6 just -- you know, they make the distinction that the 7 board should continue to function. 8 MR. KATYAL: Yes. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though their 10 original delegation was limited to 2010 - 11 MR. KATYAL: Right. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- they, acting as a 13 board, get to delegate to themselves as the group the 14 authority to go beyond that. 15 MR. KATYAL: Right. I suppose that -- I 16 mean, it's not presented here but yes, I suppose that 17 would be permissible. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, what if the 19 board, consisting of five members -- let's say three 20 Democrats and two Republicans -- the three Democrats 21 delegate to a group the authority to act as a board. 22 They designate themselves as the members of the group. 23 They have at that point, authorized themselves to act as 24 the board with as little as two members, even though 25 they couldn't have done that as members of the board.

1 MR. KATYAL: I think that's right, 2 Mr. Chief Justice, and it underscores that the statute 3 itself can't control all of those problems and whether 4 you set the quorum at three or two, even if you have a 5 full board of five, you can have these machinations that 6 are potentially - 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though the 8 whole -- even though the whole purpose of expanding from 9 three to five was to ensure that more than two are 10 required for the board to act? 11 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think that the purpose, 12 as the legislative history reveals, and it's set out in 13 our brief, was to increase efficiency and to have 14 overlapping panels adjudicating cases. I do think that 15 there's a -- there's ways to prevent your situation from 16 happening; that, and they include not just removal for 17 cause, which I think this would be the paradigmatic case 18 if three members of the body were trying to cut out two 19 members from doing their job. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not trying to, but 21 succeeding in doing so. 22 MR. KATYAL: Succeeding, absolutely. And I 23 think - 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, it 25 depends upon who would remove them for cause.

KATYAL: And then you would have 8 other -- you would have other checks as well. If you 9 had one-party government and all of these factors 10 aligning in the way you are suggesting, you would have 11 the possibility that the circuit court's review under 12 160(f) might come into play, I mean, because each board 13 decision can be potentially appealed to a circuit court. 14 There is budgetary processes and - 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I just want to make 16 sure there is nothing to constrain -- if you have three 17 Democrats, three -- or two Republicans or, of course, 18 the other way around, nothing to constrain them from 19 acting fully as the board with only two -- two 20 Democrats? 21 MR. KATYAL: I don't think the statute 22 itself constrains it - 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the statute. 24 MR. KATYAL: -- under either my friend's 25 reading or mine. I think that rather, it is a matter of

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 etiquette, practice, tradition, and all sorts of 2 institutional checks that are laced into the way in 3 which the board - 4 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any other legal - 5 this is what -- one thing, if I were thinking without 6 the language for a moment, and I -- the Taft-Hartley 7 Congress did, I think, want to limit the powers in a 8 number of ways of the board, maybe expand the membership 9 to be sure there would be both parties in larger 10 numbers. 11 If you could limit this to adjudications, 12 you would say, well, then they can't set major policy 13 with just two members. But I don't see a way to do 14 that, particularly since the board has often set rules 15 in adjudication which have broad application. 16 So am I right in thinking that we have to 17 decide either, it is okay for two members to set the 18 most major policies, or we have to say they can't even 19 conduct adjudication, even the simplest adjudication, 20 even the least significant? 21 MR. KATYAL: I think -- I think, Justice 22 Breyer, that the board traditionally doesn't engage in 23 much rulemaking. It does make its decisions - 24 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. But that is a 25 rule. They set a rule in the adjudication -
37 Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. KATYAL: And I do agree that -- that at 2 stake here is the potential to decide cases. Now, when 3 you mention the Taft-Hartley Act, I think that that 4 legislative history is important for a different reason, 5 which is up in -- from 1935 to 1947, and this is set out 6 in footnote 1 of our brief, that board decided over 7 460 cases as a two-member body. There was a vacant 8 third position. 9 And there were 2 years of debate, 10 contentious debate, as you alluded to before, about 11 Taft-Hartley, and yet they left that piece intact. They 12 permitted two-member bodies to decide these cases. And 13 so to the extent legislative history is relevant for 14 members of the Court, we suggest it strongly suggests 15 that what the board did here, faced with this vacancy 16 crisis, mirrors what happened between 1935 and - 17 JUSTICE ALITO: It begs the question - 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose our 19 first inquiry were agency law, and we concluded that 20 under agency law when the principal ceases to exist the 21 agent may no longer function. Let's assume we conclude 22 that under agency law. Could you then cite us a case or 23 a rationale for saying that agency law should not apply 24 to a government agency, to a problem of this type, and 25 if so, what is your authority?

1 MR. KATYAL: Sir, they are set out at page 2 28 of our brief. They are United States v. Wyder, the 3 two Donovan cases. I think it is a long-established 4 principle that principal/agent relationships, which we 5 don't think necessarily apply to this case, but even did 6 you -- even were you to disagree, as the premise of your 7 question suggested, that government delegations survive 8 the loss of that principal. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is your point that 10 official acts done stay in effect even though the 11 official is gone, until the official's successor in 12 office is appointed and that successor can remand the 13 instruction? 14 MR. KATYAL: That's -- that's precisely 15 correct. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that is like the de 17 facto officer doctrine. It could be that, if the 18 Petitioner prevails here, the de facto officer doctrine 19 would leave in place everything that has been done. 20 MR. KATYAL: Justice Kennedy, those - 21 that's a different - 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that's 23 quite a different -- different point. 24 MR. KATYAL: Absolutely. That's a different 25 point. What I'm saying and what these cases say is
39 Alderson Reporting Company

1 that, for example, when an attorney general designates 2 their power to -- the wiretap authority to a 3 subordinate, an assistant attorney general, and then 4 that attorney general leaves office, that wiretap 5 authority nonetheless continues in the subordinate until 6 it is revoked by a successor. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: But hasn't the situation 8 that has prevailed now for some time changed the -- the 9 decision-making process of the board in at least two 10 important ways? First, there isn't any opportunity for 11 full board review of cases. But more important, if you 12 have only two members on the board and only two members 13 on the panel, the process is very different from a panel 14 in which there were three members, or in which two 15 members can be supplemented with an additional member if 16 they can't agree. 17 What are the two to do? They have to - 18 they have to split the difference all the time. And 19 there have been decisions in which the members have - 20 basically have suggested that that's exactly what has 21 happened. 22 MR. KATYAL: Justice Alito, I am not here 23 suggesting that the two-member board is ideal or 24 equivalent or optimal to a -- an optimal thing. 25 Congress set out five. But faced with a vacancy crisis
40 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and shutting down the board entirely, I think the board 2 did the prudent thing here by continuing to operate, 3 continuing for these 800 or so days to decide these 4 cases. 5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, not only is the 6 two-member board not -- not ideal. Do you think it is 7 reasonably possible that Congress back in 1947 8 contemplated this particular problem and would have 9 solved it the way you suggest? 10 MR. KATYAL: I do think that Congress had 11 before it a well -- it was well-known that over 460 12 times the board had decided cases with only two members, 13 with the third being vacant. And I think that's what - 14 JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's always when 15 there is -- there is in existence three people who could 16 have served. But the particular problem we've got now, 17 going on for 2 or 3 years: All the decisions by two 18 members. Do you think Congress would have authorized 19 this? 20 MR. KATYAL: As opposed to shutting down the 21 entire board, yes, Justice Stevens. I think that's the 22 purpose of the - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends. I mean, if 24 shutting down is the only way to put pressure on 25 Congress to -- I mean, you may have a Congress that is

1 just delighted to have only two Democratic members left 2 on the board and all the cases decided by two Democratic 3 members. What possible incentive does that Congress 4 have to increase the board to -- to the level that it 5 should be? None. 6 If you want to solve the crisis that you are 7 so worried about, the only way to solve it is to say: 8 Boy, you know, there is -- it's Armageddon coming; we 9 are going to not be able to act at all. That would 10 solve the crisis. 11 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think the politics in 12 Armageddon could cut different ways, depending -- I 13 mean, these are nomination battles that are focused on 14 individual personalities. And, Justice Scalia, the only 15 empirical evidence we have -- this is not the first time 16 the board has done this, contrary to my friend's 17 suggestion earlier. 18 In 2005, the board was faced with the exact 19 same situation. The board was going to go down to two 20 members. They decided to do the exact same delegation 21 and give -- give all the powers to a group of three, and 22 four days later, Congress fixed the problem with the 23 president. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm much more impressed 25 by -- by your opponent's assertion, which I don't think
42 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 you have contradicted, that for many years whenever 2 there was a death in one of the three-member panels, 3 that panel was reconstituted. A new person was 4 appointed, instead of just letting it continue to 5 operate with only two. Doesn't that mean something? 6 Doesn't that suggest that these panels were viewed by 7 the board as requiring three people? 8 MR. KATYAL: No, it suggests that they 9 thought three was optimal, where it was -- where they 10 could get three bodies. But here, when they only have 11 two -- and again, faced with shutting down and not 12 deciding the lion's share of cases, which aren't the 13 controversial ones that give rise to the disagreement, 14 Justice Alito, that you were positing -- they've decided 15 to go and do it -- and do their business and try and 16 resolve these. 17 And they have done, I think -- the corpus 18 reveals a really remarkable job at reaching agreement in 19 a large number of cases on the basis of existing 20 precedent. Are these decisions - 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- how has it -- how 22 has it worked? And I understand that they are not 23 dealing with controversial decisions. How many 24 decisions are there now? 25 MR. KATYAL: I believe that there is 586 or

1 so decisions that they have rendered, and of those they 2 have set aside about approximately 70. It was 65 as of 3 a few days ago and it's gone up, because they involve 4 questions about overturning precedent or novel issues, 5 and so they haven't reached agreement in those. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What actually 7 happens on -- on the ground? Somebody complains about 8 an unfair labor practice to the board, and let's say the 9 petitioner prevails and the board can't function. What 10 happens next? Is there -- I don't know if there would 11 be a review or not, but can you go to the court of 12 appeals? 13 MR. KATYAL: If -- if -- if the board is 14 disabled? 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, assume there is 16 no board. As you say, the -- the problem that would 17 happen if you don't prevail? 18 MR. KATYAL: Well, if there is -- if there 19 is no board, then I take it the cases would get stuck 20 after the ALJ. There is nothing to take exception to, 21 and so I'm not sure they could go directly to the court 22 of appeals, because the statute, 160(f), I think, 23 doesn't permit review from an ALJ decision directly up. 24 It permits review only of the board's decisions. And if 25 there is no board decision, then presumably these cases

How many cases? Has it only been this 9 instance where it has been two members or have there 10 been other instances? 11 MR. KATYAL: Well, the -- the board only 12 went down to two members as a whole starting in 1993. 13 It has happened four times: In 1993 for 2 months; in 14 2001, I believe for 1 month; in 2005 for only a few 15 days. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that when the 400 cases 17 that you are talking about were? 18 MR.

1 think that that is crucial language, because that is a 2 subordinating conjunction. And what it does is 3 essentially modify that. The two-member quorum language 4 modifies what happens before, the "at all times" - 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you need the "except 6 that" once you have language. You need it because now 7 you have a bigger board and it says there is a 8 three-member quorum. 9 MR. KATYAL: Precisely. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought they -- they 11 simply are taking the earlier phrase, the earlier 12 statutory phrase, and they are changing those words 13 because grammatically you now need it? 14 MR. KATYAL: Precisely correct. You need it 15 grammatically because otherwise if you didn't have 16 something like that, it would suggest that the panel 17 quorum would be three as well. But -- but the language 18 is quite specific on this and, contrary to what the D.C. 19 Circuit found, "at all times" is modified by that 20 subordinating conjunction in the phrase that follows. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what authority 22 does an ALJ purport and in fact exercise? He's not 23 acting or she's not acting for the board? 24 MR. KATYAL: The -- the ALJ is appointed by 25 the board and they essentially write tentative decisions

1 that the board, as I understand it, can approve or 2 disapprove. Exceptions can be taken by litigants up to 3 the board. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under the Petitioner's 5 theory, if there is no quorum would those appointments 6 then be invalidated, too? 7 MR. KATYAL: Well, I -- and this goes to 8 Justice Scalia's first question of the argument, I -- I 9 think that it's possible. I think that there is -- the 10 D.C. Circuit's reasoning is -- potentially could be read 11 so broadly as to say that the entire board goes poof and 12 everything under it, including the salaries. 13 I think if the Court were inclined to -- to 14 write a decision like that, we would try to look to, as 15 you mentioned before, the de facto officer doctrine and 16 the specific language of the delegations to the ALJ's 17 and the specific language to the general counsels, to 18 try to see if there is a way to preserve all of the 19 board's action in this circumstance. 20 Of course, that isn't before the Court at 21 this point, but I understand that the dramatic 22 consequences, potentially dramatic consequences of the 23 D.C. Circuit's ruling, may inform the judgment. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do we have any notion 25 when -- when the board will reduce to one?

1 (Laughter.) 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: When -- when -- when is one 3 of the two's term over? 4 MR. KATYAL: In the absence of any further 5 confirmations or other appointments, one of the members, 6 Member Schaumber, will leave on August 27th of this 7 year. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of this year. At which 9 point there will be some pressure on Congress, I guess, 10 right? 11 MR. KATYAL: There will. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are -- there are 13 two nominees, are there not? 14 MR. KATYAL: There are three nominees 15 pending right now. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Three? 17 MR. KATYAL: Yes. And they have been 18 pending. They were named in July of last year. They 19 were voted out of committee in October. One of them had 20 a hold and had to be renominated. That renomination 21 took place. There was a failed quorum -- a failed 22 cloture vote in February. And so all three nominations 23 are pending. And I think that underscores the general 24 contentious nature of the appointment process with 25 respect to this set of issues.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the recess 2 appointment power doesn't work why? 3 MR. KATYAL: The -- the recess appointment 4 power can work in -- in a recess. I think our office 5 has opined the recess has to be longer than 3 days. 6 And -- and so, it is potentially available to avert the 7 future crisis that -- that could -- that could take 8 place with respect to the board. 9 If there are no other questions - 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 11 Mr. Richie, you have 3 minutes remaining. 12 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHELDON E. RICHIE 13 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 14 MR. RICHIE: First, let me address the - 15 the issue of what happens if we prevail, how will the 16 problem be fixed. There are two types of cases. There 17 are representation cases, and then there are cases 18 dealing with unfair labor practices. 19 The unfair labor practices, 20 Mr. Chief Justice, have a limitations period to them. 21 The -- the issues -- the issues with respect to 22 representation have no limitations. So in response to 23 Justice Ginsburg's comment -- I believe it was 24 Justice Ginsburg -- there's a -- when a successor comes 25 on board, these issues, if these -- if we prevail and
50 Alderson Reporting Company

1 our decision is vacated, those are -- can be reheard by 2 the board when a successor is in place. 3 The D.C. Circuit - 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Just the - 5 just the representation cases, not the unfair labor 6 practice cases? 7 MR. RICHIE: That's correct. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wouldn't the - 9 MR. RICHIE: Well, except to the extent, 10 Justice Scalia, that the statute of limitations has not 11 run on those unfair labor - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I understand. 13 MR. RICHIE: -- cases. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wouldn't -- wouldn't 15 the statute of limitations at least be told during the 16 period when they can't do anything? I suppose that's a 17 different case. 18 MR. RICHIE: That's an argument. That's a 19 different case. I don't know the answer. And I'm sure 20 the litigants would argue that. 21 With respect to the issue of the -- whether 22 it's three members that are required on both the board 23 and the group, the D.C. Circuit didn't deal with that, 24 but they did deal with the exception issue. And they 25 said -- I'm reading from the appendix page 89 of our

1 petition: The board forum requirement therefore must be 2 satisfied regardless of whether the board's authority is 3 delegated to a group of its members. 4 A modifying phrase such as -- as this, 5 talking about the "at all times three members" denotes 6 that there is no instance in which the board forum 7 requirement may be disregarded. 8 And then the court said: "It therefore 9 defies logic as well as the text of the statute to argue 10 as the board does that a Congress which explicitly 11 imposed a requirement for a three-member quorum at all 12 times would in the same sentence allow the board to 13 reduce its operative quorum to two without further 14 congressional authorization." 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Except that it said 16 "except." 17 (Laughter.) 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: At all times "except." 19 MR. RICHIE: And, Justice Ginsburg, that was 20 what the D.C. Circuit was referring to was the "except 21 that" language, and saying in that same sentence, where 22 there is a requirement at all times of a three-member 23 quorum of the board, that it is -- it defies logic that 24 Congress would in that same sentence state except when 25 there is three that falls to two.
