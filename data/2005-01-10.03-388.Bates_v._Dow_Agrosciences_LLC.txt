3 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument in Bates

4 against Dow AgroSciences.

5 Mr. Frederick.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

9 may it please the Court:

10 Pesticides are economic poisons designed to kill

11 living things. Sometimes they do not work as designed.

12 For more than a century until the 1990's, courts

13 routinely permitted farmers to bring claims against

14 pesticide manufacturers for crop damage caused by

15 pesticides. In enacting amendments to FIFRA in 1972,

16 Congress did not intend to displace those preexisting

17 State law remedies.

18 The farmers here allege claims for defective

19 design, defective manufacturing, fraud, breach of

20 warranty, and failure to warn for a brand new product that

21 severely damaged their peanut crops. I'd like to start

22 with our narrowest theories for reversal and demonstrate

23 for three reasons why those claims survive preemption.

24 The defective design and manufacturing claims

25 challenge the product's composition, not its label. The

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 fraud, warranty, and negligence claims involve general

2 legal duties, not pesticide-specific requirements, and the

3 failure to warn and fraud claims are not different from or

4 in addition to FIFRA requirements.

5 Now, with respect to the first point, Dow

6 concedes at pages 43 and 49 of its brief that defective

7 design and manufacturing claims generally are not

8 preempted. That concession warrants a remand here, as

9 this case was decided before discovery, enable the farmers

10 to develop their claims.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But couldn't you make every

12 failure to warn claim a defective design claim? That is,

13 they didn't warn about the effects, but those effects

14 would not have been present if the product had been

15 designed to assure that there wouldn't be any adverse

16 effect on the peanut crop.

17 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, the way the

18 Restatement of Torts and Product Liability in sections 1

19 and 2 describe, there are basically three theories that

20 products liability claims can proceed on: a defective

21 design, defective manufacturing, and defective warnings.

22 The restatement explains that they are distinct legal

23 theories that go to different problems that the

24 manufacturer has caused with respect to the product. A

25 defective design claim asserts that the composition was

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 inadequate and that a properly designed product could have

2 been put on the market that would not cause the harm.

3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Frederick, on the

4 defective design claim, presumably that's based on a

5 factual theory that Dow could have reasonably designed

6 Strongarm to be safe for growing peanuts in high-acid

7 soil.

8 MR. FREDERICK: Correct.

9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But doesn't that mean your

10 client should have to put forward some evidence

11 establishing a material issue of disputed fact on that

12 point?

13 MR. FREDERICK: Certainly, but here --

14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And it didn't do that.

15 MR. FREDERICK: Well here, Your Honor, the

16 motion for summary judgment that Dow filed was not based

17 on the merits of the claims. It was based on them being

18 preempted, displaced as a matter of Federal law. They

19 also asserted a limitation of -- of remedy provision.

20 But we never had discovery in this case. The

21 District Court, after finding jurisdiction, considered

22 Dow's motion for summary judgment on preemption and locked

23 us out of the courthouse door before we ever had a chance

24 to prove that a safer design for the product could have

25 been made. And that's where we think the court's decision

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 below was overbroad and should be reversed.

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the problem I have with

3 -- with the Government's case and with the respondent's

4 case is that -- it's really the obverse of what Justice

5 Ginsburg said. Their problem is that they would recast

6 everything as a warning.

7 MR. FREDERICK: That's absolutely correct.

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the restatement have some

9 specific provisions that say no matter how good the

10 warning is, you're still entitled to proceed when there's

11 a -- I don't know -- dangerous product or defective

12 product or something?

13 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. Restatement sections 1 and

14 2 address this, and what the restatement says is that if

15 you can show that the product could have been reformulated

16 to be properly designed, then the existence of a warning

17 that might go to certain of its uses would not negate a

18 defective design claim. The Texas Supreme Court --

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even -- even if the warning

20 specifically covered that design defect?

21 MR. FREDERICK: That -- that's -- that's

22 correct. And what the restatement --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So even if this product said,

24 warning: may not be effective in high pH soils, that's

25 not good enough?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FREDERICK: Under the restatement rule,

2 which Texas has adopted in the Uniroyal case, which we've

3 cited in our brief I think at page 47, that is true

4 because the restatement explains that there are certain

5 warnings that could be ignored or not observed or not

6 understood properly and that if it can be proved that a

7 properly designed product would be on the market, there

8 are public policy reasons why that's what we want to

9 encourage manufacturers to do. I mean, under --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: At any cost? I mean, what if

11 it -- you know, yes, I can -- I can sell you stuff that

12 will -- that will work in high pH soil, but it's going to

13 be three times as effective. Do I have to sell it?

14 MR. FREDERICK: Well, the --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can't I just sell it for those

16 people who don't need it for -- for high pH soil at a

17 third the price with a warning that says, hey, by the way,

18 don't use this in high pH soil? It's crazy to say you

19 can't do that.

20 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, to answer your

21 question in several ways, that's a jury determination to

22 -- to ascertain the reasonableness of the alternate design

23 that the manufacturer would be asked to -- to do or to

24 market a separate product that was separately designed for

25 high-acid soils.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it's never a question of

2 the reasonableness or the adequacy of the warning?

3 MR. FREDERICK: I don't think it's a question of

4 warning in this sense, Justice Kennedy. If you take

5 their theory, which is that a defective design claim

6 always collapses to a failure to warn, they can put out a

7 defectively designed product that admittedly causes harm,

8 and all they have to do is change the label and say, if

9 used in these particular circumstances, it may cause harm,

10 because that would necessitate a change to the label --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, not necessarily. It

12 wouldn't be always either way. I would think that if in

13 fact you have a product and the product causes harm in a

14 subset of cases, which you could warn against, then a jury

15 could decide whether the unreasonableness consists of not

16 having designed the super-safe product or the

17 unreasonableness consists of not having had a different

18 label.

19 MR. FREDERICK: And that -- there are -- that's

20 why the restatement makes clear that there are distinctive

21 theories for defect --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: And you're arguing that in this

23 case you have the first.

24 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: It seems implausible on -- you

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 know, --

2 MR. FREDERICK: Well, we have both actually.

3 JUSTICE BREYER: -- because all they'd have to

4 do is don't use it in pH soil.

5 MR. FREDERICK: No. We have defective warning

6 too, and -- and if I can address that as well. The

7 statute here prohibits in section 136q(1) any false or

8 misleading statement in the label as to any particular.

9 Our position is that the 2000 label said, suitable for

10 peanut-growing areas in all places where peanuts are

11 grown. That was false. Under the statute, that is a

12 misbranding, and that is actionable as -- both as a

13 failure to warn, as a fraud claim, and as a breach of

14 warranty.

15 Now, the Medtronic majority made absolutely

16 clear that that kind of claim is not preempted, and in

17 fact all nine Justices agreed that when the State law

18 claim is parallel to the Federal requirements, the

19 existence of a State law remedy is not an additional

20 requirement.

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So on -- on that aspect of the

22 case, you put in your pleadings that this was a violation

23 of FIFRA.

24 MR. FREDERICK: We don't necessarily need to say

25 a violation of FIFRA is -- so long as the requirement is

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the same, although we can certainly --

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's a -- that's a bit

3 different. You were -- you were asserting a moment ago I

4 thought -- please correct me if I'm wrong -- that this was

5 a violation of FIFRA because it was misbranded.

6 MR. FREDERICK: I --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that you then

8 have a suit under FIFRA, but I don't think that was the

9 theory of your complaint.

10 MR. FREDERICK: No. The theory of our complaint

11 was a failure to warn both for negligence and as a

12 defective product.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the reason for that, I take

14 it, is that FIFRA does not -- I mean, I think you agree

15 FIFRA does not provide an independent private right of

16 action.

17 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: So you've got to sue under

19 State law, but you would -- you would kind of have a slam

20 dunk for your position, I suppose, if your pleading said,

21 the failure to warn only to the extent that in fact the --

22 the warning given in compliance with FIFRA was an

23 inadequate warning. That would -- that would keep you

24 within the -- the -- in effect, the -- the Federal limit,

25 and it would also make clear that you had a State law

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 cause of action, not a Federal cause of action.

2 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, and because --

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and that's in effect

4 what you're arguing.

5 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. And -- and because of the

6 preliminary of this suit, Justice Kennedy, we certainly

7 should have the opportunity to amend our complaint. There

8 are counterclaims that this is done at the motion for

9 declaratory judgment.

10 JUSTICE BREYER: In your view -- in your -- your

11 opinion, if you were to follow that, would EPA -- suppose

12 EPA does the following. EPA looks into this and they

13 publish a reg that says in this case or in this subset of

14 cases, or some kind of description that fits yours, we

15 think that the labeling should be thus and so and we think

16 that State tort suits will interfere with our ability to

17 promote the uniform labeling and therefore they're

18 preempted. Can the EPA do that on your theory?

19 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, it can and the -- the

20 interesting aspect of this, Justice Breyer, is that of

21 course EPA hasn't done that. EPA has made very clear it

22 never tested for efficacy. It never even gave notice and

23 comment so that --

24 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, EPA has -- has waived

25 efficacy data requirements. Right?

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. FREDERICK: Yes.

2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, is it your position that

3 a State can pass a law requiring labels to have efficacy

4 claims?

5 MR. FREDERICK: They have to do it pursuant to

6 their powers under 136v(a) which is the regulation of sale

7 or use or under 136v(c) which says that when a State

8 designates a particular locality requirement and a special

9 need, it can impose a label -- it can impose requirements

10 that the manufacturer has to comply with.

11 Now, the EPA importantly -- and this is in their

12 regulations at 163.152 -- has specifically said that

13 States have labeling authority. The States can impose

14 labeling requirements. Now, there's no reason why --

15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But you're not relying on

16 that in this cause of action.

17 MR. FREDERICK: No, Justice -- no, Justice

18 O'Connor, except to the extent that if the State can

19 affirmatively do it through a positive regulation, their

20 theory has to be wrong that the -- that any incidental

21 effect that induces a change to label is preempted. That

22 theory has to be wrong, and that's what the Fifth Circuit

23 relied on.

24 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, does -- does FIFRA

25 require the manufacturer to say on the label what the item

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 can be used for?

2 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, but I want to address --

3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So how -- how does an express

4 warranty claim escape preemption --

5 MR. FREDERICK: As the --

6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- where -- where Dow just

7 says the federally mandated statement is included on my

8 label and it's true?

9 MR. FREDERICK: A warranty claim, Justice

10 O'Connor, as this Court made clear in the Cipollone case,

11 is not a requirement under State law because it's a

12 voluntary contractual arrangement between the parties.

13 The Court I think has made clear that what has to be

14 ascertained here is does the State cause of action or the

15 State law create a requirement. That's not true in the

16 warranty case because FIFRA doesn't speak to requirements

17 in -- as to warranties. It speaks to requirements in

18 other ways.

19 So what Dow did here with its warranty was

20 completely voluntary, and the fact that it breached that

21 warranty by putting on the market a product that was not

22 suitable for the use in all areas where peanuts are grown

23 is a breach of a warranty that it voluntarily undertook.

24 Breach of that is not a requirement imposed under State

25 law. And that has been, I think, verified by seven

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Justices of this Court in the -- in the Cipollone case.

2 Now, if I could speak to the fraud claim, it is

3 important to understand that in both Cipollone and in a

4 footnote in Medtronic, the Court made clear that where

5 there are general legal duties that are not observed by

6 the manufacturer that don't go to the specific product

7 itself, those claims are not preempted.

8 Here our assertion is that Dow put on the market

9 a -- a product that was mislabeled and that they went out

10 and told people fraudulently was suitable for their uses.

11 We acted in reliance on that and we suffered damages.

12 Those are general legal duties, not pesticide-specific

13 ones. And the existence of the preemption clause of

14 136v(b) does not displace us from the opportunity to try

15 to prove to a court that fraud was committed here.

16 Now, if I could briefly address two points. One

17 is that the inducement to change theory should be

18 rejected. That was the basis on which the Fifth Circuit

19 decided this case and it is an overly broad theory for

20 several reasons.

21 First, it's not supported by the text of 136v(b)

22 which says requirements for labeling. It doesn't say

23 requirements that induce a change to the label. And

24 that's how many of the courts have gone off track since

25 the Cipollone decision was announced by this Court. They

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 have read FIFRA as saying just because the word

2 requirements is 136v(b), thereby any State law claim that

3 imposes a requirement that might induce a manufacturer to

4 change the label is thereby preempted. We think that's

5 overly broad because it confers way too much discretion on

6 manufacturers to decide what to put on labels, and they

7 can claim immunity for any overly broad claim of efficacy

8 so long as when they are sued, they can say we're induced

9 to change the label.

10 Because EPA does not evaluate the specific

11 contents with respect to efficacy or the claims that are

12 made on -- on a label, if a manufacturer makes an overly

13 ambitious statement as to efficacy, all the manufacturer

14 has to do under the inducement to change theory is go to

15 court and say we would have to change the label and

16 thereby 136v(b) preempts it.

17 Now, I'd also like to stress that the other

18 side's theory creates a huge regulatory gap. As your

19 question, Justice O'Connor, noted, the EPA does not

20 evaluate efficacy on the front end. And in fact, the

21 history behind these provisions is that EPA understood

22 from the very beginning that common law claims would serve

23 an important incidental regulatory effect.

24 If we could review the history for a moment.

25 Prior to the 1972 changes to FIFRA, for decades farmers

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 had brought claims against manufacturers for design

2 defect, for failure to warn, for the kinds of common law

3 claims that we have asserted in this case. It was so well

4 established by 1972 that there was a huge section in the

5 American Law Reports that annotated all the cases and

6 explained what the common law duties of pesticide

7 manufacturers were. Yet, notwithstanding that, when

8 Congress enacted the 1972 act, despite thousands of pages

9 of hearings, committee reports, legislative debates, there

10 is not one mention of any effort to displace those

11 preexisting common law claims.

12 And when EPA, in discharging its

13 responsibilities under the 1972 act, got overwhelmed by

14 the requirement that it re-register products that were

15 already out on the market, pursuant to the 1972 act's

16 standards, it very promptly went to Congress and said, you

17 should waive efficacy requirements because we simply can't

18 do this. Congress responded, but importantly in the

19 administrations on both sides, EPA has always understood

20 except until just a couple of years ago when the Solicitor

21 General changed the position of the Government, that these

22 kinds of incidental common law suits would have an

23 important regulatory effect.

24 If we could just take the case of DDT. For 30

25 years, manufacturers were sued for DDT and awarded damages

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 until it became clear that the groundswell over the course

2 of decades that DDT needed to be banned, and it was only

3 at the back end that the expert agency regulators

4 determined that in fact the product needed to be banned,

5 but that was only after a very long history in which

6 common law suits had provided remedies to farmers and

7 others who were harmed by that product.

8 Now, in 1982, the Reagan administration's EPA

9 expanded the efficacy waiver and it included far greater

10 products than had been done in the Carter administration

11 in 1979. And in the Federal Register notice announcing

12 that it was intending to expand that efficacy waiver, the

13 EPA in 1982 said the reason why we think this can be done

14 is because suits can be brought against manufacturers who

15 put on the market ineffective products. We cited that on

16 page 31 of our brief.

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But do you take the position

18 that juries can do what a State regulation cannot do, or

19 are they much -- are they on a par?

20 MR. FREDERICK: Well, our broadest theory,

21 Justice Kennedy, is that the word requirements in 136v(b)

22 doesn't include common law claims at all.

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose we disagree with that.

24 MR. FREDERICK: If you disagree with that, then

25 they would have to be the same, and that's why our point

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 about the existence of the parallel requirements is the

2 same.

3 I want to address the point of the discordance

4 between what State juries can decide and what State

5 regulators can decide because Dow and the Government have

6 featured that in their case. The Government in the

7 Medtronic case at page 27 of its amicus brief there said

8 there was no problem to be had with juries rendering

9 supposedly inconsistent decisions so long as they were

10 following one Federal standard. The Federal standard here

11 is clear: falsity. Tell the truth. That's what

12 manufacturers are obliged to do under the statute and

13 under the regulations.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's their strong point.

15 So what is the response to that? Because you can easily

16 get two juries in different parts of the country to decide

17 absolutely opposite things as to what the label should

18 say, and in those circumstances, they say, well, they're

19 in an impossible situation and that's why Congress passed

20 this statute, to be sure it would be EPA and not two juries

21 in different places.

22 MR. FREDERICK: First, the juries -- unlike a --

23 a declaratory judgment or an injunctive type remedy,

24 Justice Breyer, a jury for a common law damages claim is

25 not saying what affirmatively should be on the labels.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm speaking practically. And

2 I don't have to go into all the argument.

3 MR. FREDERICK: Sure.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: You know the argument. It's a

5 very familiar argument.

6 MR. FREDERICK: Sure. The answer is that --

7 that Congress was prepared to accept a certain level of

8 disuniformity when it enacted 136v because it made very

9 clear in sandwiching the preemption provision of 136b --

10 surround -- by (a) and (c) that it was prepared to allow

11 States to depart in significant respects from what was

12 nationally uniform. And the way it did so was to say

13 States can regulate sale or use and they can also impose

14 extra requirements for special locations.

15 Now, what Dow did here I think illustrates the

16 way the system is supposed to work, which is that when a

17 problem was identified with their product in the States of

18 Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, within 7 months it

19 petitioned the EPA to append to its national uniform label

20 a supplemental label. And that supplemental label says it

21 is for distribution in those three States only and it

22 provided 10 important changes to the label that it

23 otherwise had as a nationally uniform label. That's how

24 the system is supposed to work. If the incidental

25 regulatory effect of jury verdicts or common law claims

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 induces or causes some kind of change to the label, that

2 can be done without an adverse effect to national

3 uniformity through the supplemental labeling process. And

4 what Dow did here was it has its label and then it

5 attaches the supplemental label that addresses the

6 particular conditions that exist in the State.

7 And the EPA has recognized that as a perfectly

8 appropriate and valid way to address the geographic,

9 environmental, and climatic conditions that exist in the

10 different regions of the country that engage in

11 agriculture. There's nothing that is uncertain about that

12 if you accept the premise of the Government's argument in

13 Medtronic, which is that juries can be properly

14 instructed, if it came to that, so that they could follow

15 the appropriate Federal standard.

16 Now, I would like to turn -- sorry. Did you --

17 no, go ahead.

18 I would like to turn briefly to the -- the

19 requirements aspect of the case because we do think that,

20 under our broadest theory, this is a different situation

21 than Medtronic and Cipollone, and because of the important

22 statutory indications that are in the provision 136v.

23 Unlike in Medtronic, there is an explicit provision that

24 is a non-preempted provision, and that is different from

25 Medtronic. Where in Medtronic there was a provision that

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 allowed the FDA to impose its own decisions as to

2 requirements and whether or not the States should be

3 displaced, here Congress made the determination in 136v(a)

4 and in (c) that those kinds of requirements can be

5 imposed. They're in addition to what the Federal standard

6 is. That means that you have to look at requirements in a

7 somewhat different way because the States have this

8 authority that they did not have under the Medical Device

9 Amendments.

10 There's a textual indicator under (b) also which

11 refers to (a) in the sense that (b) says such State that

12 shall issue these requirements. Such -- the meaning of it

13 in Webster's means what has been already described -- is

14 in (a), and in (a) the States are authorized to promulgate

15 regulations. So we think that there is a textual basis

16 for distinguishing the word requirements that this Court

17 -- five Justices in this Court in Medtronic said would

18 encompass common law claims.

19 If there are no further questions at this time,

20 I'd like to reserve the balance --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: Let me ask one because I think

22 you'll hear some variation of this, and you have a minute,

23 which is the -- the statute sets up a perfectly good way

24 of keeping this branded stuff off the market. All any

25 complaining farmer has to do is to go to EPA and ask them

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to pull it, and pulling it is an unbelievable sanction.

2 It's like the atomic bomb on the company. And so that's

3 very strong.

4 And the only thing that leaves out is the

5 possibility of damage remedies, but if you want your

6 damage remedy, just go to EPA and tell them to give it to

7 you because they can write the rule the other way that I

8 was suggesting.

9 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I don't think that EPA

10 could write a rule requiring damages to be done. It

11 doesn't have the statutory authority --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: They would just say it doesn't

13 preempt.

14 MR. FREDERICK: Well, there's no indication here

15 that EPA can do that kind of thing. In FIFRA, it

16 certainly doesn't have that kind of provision. I mean,

17 certainly there are different ways that the statute could

18 have been written. That isn't the choice that Congress

19 made.

20 Thank you.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Waxman.

22 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

23 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

24 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Stevens, and may it please

25 the Court:

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 FIFRA's preemption provision, which Congress

2 specifically amended in 1978 to add the title uniformity,

3 preempts by its terms, quote, requirements for labeling

4 different from those required under FIFRA.

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why doesn't the other

6 amendment limit your argument? Because Congress has also

7 passed an amendment to the effect that unless EPA chooses

8 to get in to the business of -- of passing on efficacy, it

9 -- it need not do so. And in fact we know it is not doing

10 so. Why, therefore, doesn't the uniformity argument go to

11 those subjects that EPA does review for and why doesn't

12 the subject of efficacy, in effect, drop out of -- of the

13 -- the whole preemption claim?

14 MR. WAXMAN: There are -- there are two

15 fundamental reasons. The first is that it is a principal

16 requirement of FIFRA, and has been since 1972 and remains,

17 that a manufacturer may only sell a registered pesticide

18 with the precise labeling to the word and font size that

19 EPA has approved, and that requirement applies whether the

20 wording relates to human safety, environmental protection,

21 or efficacy.

22 Now, the specific amendment in 1978 was, as Mr.

23 Frederick indicated, represented a representation by EPA

24 to Congress -- and Congress' -- the -- the committee

25 report plainly indicates this -- that the EPA was not

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 saying we are no longer regulating efficacy, we are no

2 longer concerned with efficacy. What they said was

3 because the Department of Agriculture and the extension

4 services and the State universities are all involved in

5 this and, in particular, are involved in the statutory

6 requirement that before a manufacturer can even apply for

7 registration, even submit a registration application, the

8 manufacturer must do extensive, rigorous efficacy testing,

9 which Congress has indicated correctly is very expensive

10 --

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not monitored at

12 all. The -- the manufacturer can say -- make up reports

13 and EPA is never going to look at it.

14 MR. WAXMAN: If the manufacturer makes up

15 reports, it has committed a felony. EPA can enforce it.

16 It can refer it to the Attorney General. It's just like

17 the --

18 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But maybe it isn't a labeling

19 violation. I mean, there are claims made here that I have

20 trouble shoehorning into your theory. For instance, why

21 does a claim that Dow negligently failed to field test its

22 product on peanuts on acid soil impose a label

23 requirement?

24 MR. WAXMAN: Justice --

25 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I -- I just don't understand

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that.

2 MR. WAXMAN: Justice O'Connor, I think -- I will

3 address the negligent testing and, of course, the design

4 defect --

5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.

6 MR. WAXMAN: -- discussion that's figured so

7 prominently in my colleague's argument.

8 It's very, very important to understand that

9 unlike in Sprietsma and Medtronic and so many of the --

10 and, for that matter, with respect to the preempted claims

11 in Cipollone, the claims that were preempted below, we

12 didn't file a rule 12 motion to dismiss. We couldn't have

13 with respect to at least one of those two claims. We

14 filed a motion for summary judgment that said with respect

15 to -- let me take design defect first. With respect to

16 design defect, it is possible under Texas State law to

17 state a claim for products liability under defective

18 design without impeaching the labeling.

19 And there is a brief filed in this case by Dean

20 Powers, the University of Texas Law School, for the -- the

21 Texas Chemistry Council who's an expert on Texas tort law,

22 and he goes through the Texas torts in detail to show why

23 they are all preempted and all invalid under independent

24 and adequate State grounds.

25 But what we did is we didn't move to dismiss.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 We filed a motion for summary judgment, and in that motion

2 for summary judgment, we pointed the respondents in this

3 case to this Court's decision in Celotex v. Catrett, and

4 we said, in effect, we know that you can allege a design

5 defect claim without impeaching the labeling, but we think

6 that what you are complaining about does impeach the

7 labeling. Therefore, show us what you have.

8 Now, under rule 56, they had two alternatives.

9 They could have filed an affidavit or a request under rule

10 56(f), as this Court referenced in Anderson v. Liberty

11 Lobby, and said, hey, we don't know how this was made. We

12 don't know how this was tested. We don't know how this

13 was manufactured. We're entitled to discovery, and

14 district courts recognize that all the time. What they

15 did --

16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And they didn't do that?

17 MR. WAXMAN: They did not do that, and what they

18 did was to submit affidavits and documentary evidence,

19 including expert affidavits.

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, you said

21 they didn't file a motion to dismiss. I thought you

22 brought the lawsuit.

23 MR. WAXMAN: We brought the lawsuit and we --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: But then they couldn't file --

25 MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. I said we didn't file

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 a motion to dismiss --

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: You didn't file a motion to

3 dismiss your own complaint?

4 MR. WAXMAN: No, no. Their counterclaims.

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, okay.

6 MR. WAXMAN: In other words, this wasn't decided

7 -- Mr. Frederick's reply brief talks over and over and

8 over again about how this was decided on the pleadings,

9 and you know, there was no discovery allowed. Under rule

10 56, they could have asked for discovery when we basically

11 said, okay, let's show our hands. We got two jacks. What

12 do you got? And what their expert said and what their

13 response said was if the 2001 amended label had been on

14 it, we wouldn't have been injured.

15 Now, rule 56(c) says that when you oppose a

16 summary judgment motion with affidavit evidence, the

17 burden is on the adverse -- the adverse party must by

18 affidavits, or otherwise provided in this rule, set forth

19 specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for

20 trial, and they didn't do that.

21 Now, the classic design defect -- let me -- let

22 me give you an example.

23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let's just try to boil

24 it down a little bit for my purposes. Do you concede that

25 there could be a claim based on no testing --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. WAXMAN: Well --

2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- that there could be a

3 claim based on design defect, that there could be a claim

4 saying there were off-label oral statements made that

5 amounted to fraud or misleading --

6 MR. WAXMAN: I'll take them in your precise

7 order.

8 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay.

9 MR. WAXMAN: Under Texas law -- and the Court of

10 Appeals opinion, the Grinnell opinion cited by the Court

11 of Appeals opinion, says this, as does Dean Powers. Under

12 Texas law, negligent testing is not an independent tort.

13 It is of necessity a subset of inadequate warnings. It is

14 an element of a -- the tort -- the claim of product defect

15 related to warnings. And so it is not possible under

16 Texas law, settled Texas law. Other States are different,

17 but Texas in its sovereign capacity has chosen to make

18 claims of negligent testing an element of the tort of

19 defective product by failure to warn, and that --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the way you proceeded in

21 this case, you made it clear that it would be impossible

22 for the Texas court itself to weigh in on this because you

23 jumped the gun. They wanted to proceed in Texas court,

24 and then we would have known what Texas law was on these

25 subjects. You said, no, we want to be in the Federal

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 forum.

2 MR. WAXMAN: We want -- as the -- as the Fifth

3 Circuit found and the District Court found, we filed a

4 declaratory judgment in Texas after we received their

5 demand letters because we wanted this to be adjudicated in

6 a single forum, which the Texas venue rules would not have

7 allowed, and we -- we actually filed this in Lubbock,

8 Texas, which is the geographic center of where these 29

9 farmers operate.

10 Now, with respect to defective design, yes,

11 under Texas law if they had a -- they have to allege and

12 they have to prove that there is a safer alternative

13 design for this product, which they never even introduced

14 one quantum of evidence about. But --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me you're --

16 you're arguing the merits of the tort claims rather than

17 the preemption issue.

18 MR. WAXMAN: Well, what we said was your claims

19 are preempted if they impeach the labeling that we are

20 required by Federal law to use.

21 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But they now say they don't.

22 They ought to be able to proceed on those claims. What do

23 we do with that?

24 MR. WAXMAN: Well, what this -- what -- what

25 happens under rule 56 --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And also the -- also the

2 claims of false, misleading statements outside the label.

3 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. I'm going to get to the false

4 and misleading statements outside the labeling in a

5 minute, but just to finish the design defect point, they

6 filed a complaint -- a counterclaim which had as a count

7 this was defectively designed. It is possible under Texas

8 law to prove that something is defectively designed. If

9 they had come in and said, but we filed a motion for

10 summary judgment that says here's our evidence and we

11 don't think that you can satisfy -- that you are, in fact,

12 complaining about a defective design --

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: But if they did allege a

14 defective design claim under Texas law, would that have

15 been preempted?

16 MR. WAXMAN: No. If -- if they had said, look,

17 the problem with this, which as footnote 9 of our brief

18 indicates, it's not a --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me your argument

20 is not whether there's preemption. It's whether there's a

21 State cause of -- State law cause of action.

22 MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. It's -- it's both.

23 With respect to defective design, what we said is, your

24 claim is preempted because you aren't going to go to the

25 jury on defective design without impeaching the label. If

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 we're wrong, prove it in response to our summary judgment

2 submission.

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you can --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that their burden?

5 MR. WAXMAN: It is --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that their burden or is your

7 burden to show --

8 MR. WAXMAN: It is -- it is absolutely their

9 burden in -- as the responding party to a motion for

10 summary judgment, to show that there are material facts

11 that are either in dispute or there are material facts

12 that would allow them to go to the jury.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: But on your theory there is no

14 material fact, it seems to me, because your -- what you

15 say they cannot make good on that claim without impeaching

16 the label.

17 MR. WAXMAN: And they --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Every time they sue on the --

19 on the ground that -- let's say, that -- that the -- the

20 actual use was inconsistent with what the label described,

21 you could say, gee, if their theory is correct, we'd have

22 to change our label to say that what's on the label now is

23 in fact not properly descriptive of the product. So it's

24 not a -- a question of needing more fact. On your theory,

25 whenever they, in effect, sue on the basis of what you

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 say, your response is going to be, as a matter of law,

2 well, if they're correct, we'd have to say something else.

3 That impeaches the label. Therefore, preemption.

4 MR. WAXMAN: That is exactly right. What they

5 could have done in response to our motion for summary

6 judgment is to say this product assertedly harms -- when

7 it is applied before the seed is planted, will harm the

8 product it is -- the plant that it's supposed to protect

9 if the soil pH is too high. They could have easily have

10 come back and said if they had a -- a design defect claim

11 that didn't impeach the label to say you should have --

12 there was a way to manufacture this product. You could

13 have it in pellet form rather than in the soluble form or

14 if the problem was the alkalinity of the soil, there is a

15 way to design this so that it is dissolved in a more

16 acidic solution.

17 The classic case, which is referenced in the

18 NRDC brief, which has many, many examples of true design

19 defect claims that don't impeach labels, is a case

20 involving rat poison. It's a case called Banks v. ICI

21 America. It's a Georgia Supreme Court --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: So you quite clearly have both.

23 I understand that.

24 Let me ask you a question about the -- the

25 preemption point because what I think they're saying is go

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 read the red brief, your brief, pages 6 and 7, and there

2 you see a statutory requirement and you see regulatory

3 requirements, regulation. And I think one of their claims

4 is we are arguing that that statutory requirement, without

5 any change in the regulatory, that -- that it was

6 violated. These are false. They're misbranded. So we

7 are not imposing a requirement different from or in

8 addition to the requirement of Federal law. We are

9 enforcing a requirement that is the same as the

10 requirement of Federal law, and if, by the way, the EPA

11 were to think that tort suits in those circumstances in

12 practice are too disuniform, let them promulgate a

13 regulation to that effect. But they haven't.

14 Now, what -- what is the answer to that

15 argument?

16 MR. WAXMAN: The answer is threefold. Number

17 one, a challenge to a -- the wording of a statement on the

18 label on the grounds that it is false and misleading is --

19 does impose a requirement different than Federal law, not

20 the requirement that -- that labeling not be false and

21 misleading, but the fundamental requirement that a --

22 unless and until the EPA says otherwise, the manufacturer

23 can only sell this product with the precise labeling that

24 EPA has approved. And it -- if you look at page 63a --

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, do I --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. WAXMAN: -- of the joint appendix --

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, do I take it from

3 what you have just said that there is no -- even though

4 the statute prohibits misbranding, that there is no way

5 that that can be privately enforced, that misbranding is

6 something strictly for EPA to deal with, that the statute

7 has a prohibition on misbranding? I can see the argument

8 that all we're doing is enforcing the provision that says

9 no misbranding. So is EPA the only the player in the

10 misbranding --

11 MR. WAXMAN: Insofar as labeling is concerned,

12 the answer is yes, and that's because the statute -- the

13 statute has many, many instances in which it makes it

14 clear that in service of the objective of a nationally

15 uniform label, the expert agency that approves and

16 dictates the language of that label be the one to decide

17 what is or isn't --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Waxman --

19 JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that?

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- can I ask you one question

21 here?

22 JUSTICE BREYER: Because you were just going to

23 point out where it says that --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: It goes to your --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: -- which I think is --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: Excuse me.

2 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry.

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Just let me ask this one

4 question. Supposing the label says, this product contains

5 vitamin A. Period. And it doesn't contain vitamin A, and

6 they prove that in court. And you say you would have to

7 change the label. I suggest you could change the product

8 by putting vitamin A in it.

9 MR. WAXMAN: Well, you can -- you're --

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't that an answer to

11 the misbranding? You change the product not necessarily

12 the label.

13 MR. WAXMAN: Because the difference between a --

14 that would be a -- a manufacturing defect, which are cases

15 that have been decided --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: It would be a false statement

17 in the label. The label happened to be false, a

18 misrepresentation in it.

19 MR. WAXMAN: If -- if the -- if it contains --

20 I'm sorry. Was it vitamin A? If it contains vitamin A

21 because that's what the manufacturer intended and that's

22 what the manufacturer produced --

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. The manufacturer knew it

24 didn't contain it. He falsely put that in the

25 statement --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. WAXMAN: Oh, I see. Said that --

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- and -- and it's -- it's a

3 misbranded, false statement. Now, does he have to change

4 the label or could he change the product?

5 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I believe that you have --

6 you would have to -- I mean, would it be efficacious with

7 vitamin A? I don't know, but if it -- if it requires a

8 change in the label, it has to be done by EPA because the

9 manufacturer commits a Federal law violation if it sells

10 the product with any different label. If you -- if I can

11 just direct the Court's attention to --

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I'm suggesting he

13 could sell the product with the same label if he just

14 changed the product to correct the misstatement.

15 MR. WAXMAN: Well, the test, as the Fifth

16 Circuit stated, Justice Stevens, is whether a judgment

17 against Dow -- I'm quoting. Quote: whether a judgment

18 against Dow would cause it to need to alter the Strongarm

19 label. I'm -- and that's the -- those are -- that's the

20 test that was applied here and is always applied.

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but why --

22 MR. WAXMAN: That is, does the State law cause

23 of action -- is it premised on a State law duty that there

24 -- that different labeling be used --

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but neither --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. WAXMAN: -- that is, a little bit different

2 than what Federal law requires.

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: The problem that I think some

4 of -- several of us are having is that both the -- as I

5 understand it, the Fifth Circuit test in your argument

6 draws no distinction between the two following kinds of

7 situations. Situation A: there's something that the

8 manufacturer should have told you, should have put on the

9 label, but the manufacturer didn't. Situation B: the

10 manufacturer puts something on the label which in fact is

11 wrong and in Justice Stevens' example is in fact false and

12 it causes harm.

13 It makes sense, it seems to me, for preemption

14 purposes to say if the person who sues sues simply on the

15 ground that I bought it in reliance on the label, the

16 label was false, I should get damages for -- for whatever

17 harm was caused, that situation should be dealt with for

18 preemption purposes differently from the situation in

19 which the -- the manufacturer made no false statement. He

20 simply should have said more. And if -- if you don't

21 distinguish between those two situations, then the -- the

22 prohibition against mislabeling means absolutely nothing

23 because -- because it can never be enforced, in effect,

24 except with respect to some prospective user. It can

25 never be enforced with respect to the actual user.

1 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Souter, that is a choice

2 that Congress could have made. It is plainly not a choice

3 that Congress did make because it applied the preemption

4 provision to requirements that are either in addition to

5 or different than. And whether a label is assertedly

6 misleading because it fails to include something on the

7 EPA-approved label or --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Requirements for labeling or

9 packaging --

10 MR. WAXMAN: Yes.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that are in addition to or

12 different.

13 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. I -- I --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Requirements for labeling or

15 packaging.

16 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, and -- and if it -- if the --

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, and the argument that's

18 being made is that we ought to -- we ought to read -- we

19 ought to read the limitation, which Justice Scalia has

20 just described, with respect to labeling and packaging, in

21 a relatively narrow way to allow the suit to go forward

22 and, therefore, we ought to make a distinction between the

23 two kinds of situations.

24 MR. WAXMAN: The allegation in this suit -- the

25 claims in this suit -- and I -- I see that my time has

3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

4 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

5 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

6 MS. BLATT: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

7 it please the Court:

8 It would entirely destroy the uniformity

9 contemplated by -- contemplated by the statute if the EPA-

10 approved and mandated label were subject to jury-by-jury

11 invalidation based on a jury's determination of whether a

12 label is false.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is a new position for the

14 Government, isn't it?

15 MS. BLATT: Yes, we have --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: You used to take the opposite

17 position.

18 MS. BLATT: That's right.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: And we're dealing here, as --

20 nobody has mentioned it, but there -- there's a clear

21 statement rule for preemption, isn't there? Doesn't the

22 preemption of -- of traditional State powers have to be

23 clear in the statute?

24 MS. BLATT: We -- we think subsection (b) is

25 unambiguous in preempting any statement.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's ambiguous enough

2 that the Government -- the -- the chief beneficiary of the

3 -- of the supposed preemption didn't see it. It used to

4 come out the other way. How can you possibly say it's

5 clear?

6 MS. BLATT: Well, the agency is allowed to

7 change its position and we realize --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. It's -- it's

9 welcome to change it, but it -- it's one thing to change

10 it. It's another thing to change it and come in to say

11 that the question is clear.

12 MS. BLATT: Well, we think that -- we realize

13 that our position was inconsistent with not only the

14 Court's decision in Cipollone and in Medtronic that

15 recognizes that requirement extends to common law duties.

16 But more importantly, a system where a jury-by-jury on the

17 same facts could come up with completely different reasons

18 why a label is false --

19 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so if you have one

20 administration thinking the one thing and the other

21 thinking the other thing, why isn't the answer that the

22 agency can promulgate the reg it wants? And therefore if

23 the reg -- if the agency comes to that conclusion, let

24 them promulgate that reg. And if a different one thinks

25 it can work with the tort suits, let them promulgate that

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 reg.

2 MS. BLATT: Well, unlike Medtronic where

3 preemption occurred by virtue of the FDA's regulation,

4 under FIFRA there's preemption by virtue of the statute

5 itself. And I just want to give one --

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but why isn't there a big

7 difference, for purposes of your argument, between the

8 Medtronic situation and this one for the simple reason in

9 this case you've got a statute that authorizes EPA to do

10 absolutely nothing on the subject of efficacy? And EPA

11 does nothing on the subject of efficacy.

12 MS. BLATT: Well, that's just not true, with all

13 due respect. I mean, they -- the -- we don't verify the

14 accuracy of the efficacy labeling, but the requirement,

15 both in the preemption provision and in the requirement to

16 use the EPA label, clearly extends to efficacy.

17 And you can have disuniform context whether it's

18 safety or efficacy. Imagine a label that directs a

19 product to be mixed for 20 minutes. One jury could find

20 the label was false because the product should have only

21 been mixed for 10 minutes. Another jury in the same

22 courthouse could find the label was false because the

23 product should have been mixed for at least 30 minutes.

24 And this case is another really good example.

25 Now the petitioners are saying the label says that the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 soil only should be a 7.2 level. Their expert says --

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the remedy to that

3 would not necessarily be to change the label. It might be

4 to change the quality of the product that requires how

5 much time for mixing.

6 MS. BLATT: And we think it's critical that our

7 position is that this statute only operates in the area of

8 labeling, and it preempts only those State labeling

9 requirements --

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: What do you say about my

11 vitamin A example?

12 MS. BLATT: I think your vitamin A example is an

13 excellent example of a non-preempted claim. If a

14 manufacturer says that this is a pesticide and he puts

15 Clorox in the bottle, the plaintiff wants to get to the

16 jury on the theory that a reasonable manufacturer would

17 not have used Clorox. He would have used the pesticide.

18 If the argument, on the other hand, is Clorox was fine. I

19 don't have a problem with Clorox, I just wish I would have

20 been given a warning, but that's not the way a plaintiff

21 would frame his complaint.

22 We think it's critical that our theory is if the

23 plaintiff's theory of recovery is necessarily --

24 necessarily predicated on a requirement that the

25 manufacturer used a label different than the EPA-approved

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 label the Federal law required it use --

2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let's -- let's be

3 specific here. If it's a failure to test, if it's a -- a

4 design defect requirement, if it's an off-labeled, false

5 misrepresentation, why are they preempted?

6 MS. BLATT: On the face of the complaint, we

7 agree that they're not preempted. Our only position is by

8 the time it got to summary judgment, the courts decided

9 that they had no evidence on what would have been non-

10 preempted claims. If another farmer wants to bring an

11 expert that says Strongarm can be manufactured --

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: But then do you endorse the

13 theory of the Court of Appeals in this case?

14 MS. BLATT: Well, we think the Court of Appeals

15 took it claim by claim and read the affidavit -- or at

16 least the District Court did --

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: And you think just mere

18 inducement to change a label is sufficient to create

19 preemption.

20 MS. BLATT: Mere inducement only to the extent

21 that that's a shorthand way of saying the label was --

22 necessarily had to be required. Let me give you an

23 example.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: If Congress wanted that, surely

25 it could have stated it more clearly than simply saying

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the State shall not impose or continue in effect any

2 requirements for labeling or packaging. A tort suit

3 because of -- of mislabeling is not a requirement for

4 labeling or packaging.

5 MS. BLATT: If the --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: And if Congress wanted to say

7 that, they could have said it.

8 MS. BLATT: Well, I think they did say if a

9 common law duty is necessarily premised on the requirement

10 that the manufacturer used a different label than Federal

11 law required him to use. In this case, the common law

12 duty of a failure to warn is saying the manufacturer

13 should have put something on --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: You have -- you have that

15 provision which talks about requirements for labeling or

16 packaging in conjunction with another provision that

17 authorizes the State to regulate the sale or use.

18 MS. BLATT: The --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you -- you have to make

20 sense of the two.

21 MS. BLATT: Right, and that's --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it seems to me that means

23 the State can impose certain requirements upon the seller

24 to the consumer --

25 MS. BLATT: Not on labeling. Justice Scalia,

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 every day --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, every change -- virtually

3 every change -- virtually everyone -- if -- if you believe

4 the respondent's theory, virtually any State regulation of

5 the substance of the sale will require a change in the

6 label.

7 MS. BLATT: That's just not true. Every day

8 States and localities around the country are imposing use

9 restrictions. They tell -- they tell applicators and

10 users when and where to apply the pesticide and what types

11 of --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sale -- sale or use is what it

13 says.

14 MS. BLATT: That's right and they --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Say -- if they regulate the

16 sale or use.

17 MS. BLATT: That's right, and they do that every

18 day without imposing labeling requirements. Imagine --

19 imagine --

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Give me sale examples.

21 MS. BLATT: They require the manufacturer, in

22 order to sell the product, be registered with the State,

23 and they can impose whatever sale restrictions they

24 want --

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And can they --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. BLATT: -- that don't go to the labeling.

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can they do the same thing by

3 -- through jury verdicts?

4 MS. BLATT: Absolutely not. It would be bad

5 enough if a manufacturer had to shop his label around 50

6 States and had each --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So now -- so now you say a

8 State can do something by regulation that a jury can't do.

9 MS. BLATT: No. A State absolutely cannot

10 impose labeling restrictions on a manufacturer.

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking if the -- if juries

12 can do anything that the -- are -- are prohibited under

13 your view from doing anything that the State could do by a

14 State regulation.

15 MS. BLATT: Right. I'm sorry. Right. Under --

16 it -- the alternative theory would give more power to the

17 jury to impose labeling restrictions than the State, and

18 we don't think the State can do it. And it would be far

19 more pernicious if a label were subject to jury-by-jury

20 invalidation. No one would read the label, much less

21 understand it.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt, there's a brief in

23 this case -- there's a brief in this case that just shows

24 hundreds, if not thousands, of crop damage claims. And

25 your theory is that with this ambiguous provision Congress

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 wiped all that out. It's hard to believe.

2 MS. BLATT: No. Congress just wiped out

3 labeling and only those labeling requirements --

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But everything becomes -- but

5 every -- every time -- my crop was stunted. Okay. You

6 have to change the label so you can't bring that suit.

7 MS. BLATT: Justice Ginsburg, it's just not

8 true. The lower courts well understand this distinction,

9 and they -- they let go all the time claims as not

10 preempted that are true manufacturing defect or true

11 design defect claims. This is not a complete immunity.

12 This is a narrowly targeted one as to labeling.

13 There is a famous example of the Benlate --

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He says their claim is -- is

15 very simple. You didn't tell us that using this in our

16 kind of soil would stunt the crop and wouldn't kill the

17 weeds.

18 MS. BLATT: Right.

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're saying that kind

20 of claim can't be brought anymore.

21 MS. BLATT: It can be brought if there's State

22 law and evidence to support the State law that doesn't

23 attack the labeling. And our --

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I've described a set of facts

25 which your position I think you have to say affects the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 label. The -- the farmer says I bought this bottle. It

2 said okay for all peanuts. My crop grew and it was

3 stunted and the weeds stayed alive.

4 MS. BLATT: If they found an expert that said if

5 you had manufactured this differently or if you had

6 designed it differently and there was evidence to support

7 that, our view is that those claims aren't preempted. And

8 the alternative to let juries --

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. I'm not giving you that

10 case. I'm giving you exactly what happened.

11 MS. BLATT: This case -- they didn't have any

12 evidence other than saying that the label was inaccurate.

13 But the next -- another jury could rely on the

14 respondent's evidence to say the label was inaccurate

15 because it works better on high pH soil, and another jury

16 could say, well, we need a margin of safety and the label

17 should have said 6.8 instead of 7.0, which is what their

18 expert says. And you can have this time and time again

19 with how often the pesticide has to be applied, when it

20 has to be applied. And to -- and the -- the whole point

21 of section 136v(b) was to have reliability --

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that happening when EPA

23 took the opposite view? Was there this tremendous

24 disparity with juries going every which way --

25 MS. BLATT: Well, there's -- there's been

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 preemption at least since the late '80's, and I don't know

2 of cases where juries -- or the theory for recovery was

3 invalidating the label.

4 There are lots of cases that are true

5 manufacturing defect claims, and I direct your attention

6 to the Benlate where the manufacturer contaminated his

7 product. If I'm the plaintiff, my theory -- the theory

8 was you mismanufactured this product. A reasonable

9 manufacturer would have taken practices to prevent

10 contamination, and it destroyed a lot of crops and EPA

11 actually took enforcement action against that

12 manufacturer.

13 The rat poisoning example -- a 9-year-old kid

14 died of rat poisoning because it tasted like a candy bar.

15 The theory of recovery was all the manufacturer had to do

16 was put a bittering agent in it that would have made the

17 kid throw up and the rats still would have loved the

18 poisoning. That has nothing to do with the label.

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Blatt.

20 You have about 4 minutes.

21 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

22 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

23 MR. FREDERICK: I just have two points to make.

24 With respect to the summary judgment posture of

25 the case, the way this unfolded was that on one day the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 District Court decided the motion for jurisdiction, that

2 it had jurisdiction. On the very next day, Dow rushed

3 into court with its motion for summary judgment. And what

4 Mr. Waxman cites as the Celotex invocation merely says

5 that on -- on this point it is neither unfair nor

6 premature to require defendants to produce evidence in

7 support of their claims now as the Celotex trilogy

8 requires. I'm reading from their motion for summary

9 judgment. That was filed before the counterclaims.

10 The only thing that they knew about was the

11 deceptive trade practices notice letter that the farmers

12 had filed pursuant to State law. So they didn't know what

13 our claims were, and they were requiring or saying that

14 the District Court could throw us out of court without

15 giving us any opportunity to file counterclaims, much less

16 try to develop evidence that would prove them.

17 Now, with respect to the disuniformity point,

18 when Congress amended the statute in 1988 to add the word

19 uniformity, it said in that public law that it was a

20 technical amendment. We don't know why Congress put the

21 word uniformity in. The legislative history is barren.

22 It just says this is a technical amendment. It didn't

23 change the substantive provisions that empowered States to

24 impose regulations that would have the effect of

25 disuniformity.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Now, at the end of the day, we've got claims

2 that have been brought historically since the late 19th

3 century. Until EPA had a sudden change of heart, there

4 were decades in which juries made these decisions with

5 respect to these kinds of products, and those preemption

6 decisions really didn't take hold until after this Court

7 announced Cipollone in 1992. And it was only at that

8 point that the courts began to have preemption, but for

9 the previous 2 decades, juries routinely decided these

10 kinds of cases. The sky did not fall. EPA didn't come in

11 and say there's labeling disuniformity as a result of

12 this. There simply were no problems. But what did happen

13 was that the farmers who used products were able to get

14 compensation when pesticides damaged their crops.

15 Thank you.

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: The case is submitted.

17 (Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the case in the

18 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
