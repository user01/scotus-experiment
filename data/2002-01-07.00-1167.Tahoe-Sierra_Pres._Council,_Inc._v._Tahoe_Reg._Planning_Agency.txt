 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 next in Number 00-1167, Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council
 5 v. The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.
 6 Mr. Berger.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL M. BERGER
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
 9 MR. BERGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 10 please the Court:
 11 There are three important things that should be
 12 kept in mind while we're addressing the issue this
 13 morning. First, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency
 14 totally prohibited a select group of individual landowners
 15 scattered around Lake Tahoe from making any use whatever
 16 of their land. These prohibitions were never designed as
 17 the kind of planning time-out touted by TRPA and its
 18 amici. Rather, they were amendments --
 19 QUESTION: Well, what about a temporary order
 20 that says, gee, we're required by State law to develop a
 21 plan and it's going to take us a few months and, pending
 22 that, you can't develop? Now, does that invoke
 23 immediately some per se taking rule?
 24 MR. BERGER: It does if it's a flat prohibition
 25 of use, Your Honor, and if there is --

3 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: A flat prohibition that says, while
 2 we're developing this plan, which we think won't take
 3 long, you can't go ahead with your development?
 4 MR. BERGER: Justice O'Connor, I do believe that
 5 if it is a total prohibition on use, and there is no use
 6 being made of the property at the time, that it's part of
 7 the public project to have this freeze on use, and it's
 8 the public that ought to be paying for that project, not
 9 the individual landowners who are frozen out.
 10 QUESTION: Suppose that -- we'll have to play
 11 with the facts a little bit, it's a hypothetical case, but
 12 that within a month from now the World Trade Center is
 13 ready to be constructed and New York says -- and the owner
 14 wants to rebuild highrises for office only, and the city
 15 says, wait a minute, this is so important to the whole
 16 city, we need a year to think about it, a year in addition
 17 to the usual zoning process. A taking?
 18 MR. BERGER: I think if they forbid the entire
 19 use of the property and don't allow any applications for
 20 use to be made, don't allow the owner to do anything --
 21 QUESTION: Well, they could use it for a parking
 22 lot.
 23 MR. BERGER: If there is some reasonable,
 24 economically viable, productive use that can be made of
 25 the property at the time, then I don't believe we have a

4 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 per se taking.
 2 QUESTION: Well, I guess my question -- and I
 3 know you had a more general introduction before I
 4 interrupted you, is the use of a moratorium a standard
 5 instrument of zoning policy, or is it very rare? I
 6 couldn't find anything in the briefs on this.
 7 MR. BERGER: It has, I believe, become much more
 8 rare these days. There's an awful lot more planning going
 9 on. Agencies are doing a better job of planning, and they
 10 find the need for this kind of a total prohibition on
 11 development to be made.
 12 QUESTION: My impression is that most of these
 13 moratoriums, or moratoria, whatever they're called, would
 14 not be total. I mean, if you're considering altering a
 15 rural zoning scheme that now doesn't have any limit on
 16 number of residencies per acre, and you're thinking of,
 17 say, no more than one house on every 3 acres, the only --
 18 and that's what you're thinking about, the only moratorium
 19 you would have to impose would be no more -- until we make
 20 up our mind, no more than one house on every 3 acres. It
 21 wouldn't say, nobody does anything while we're sucking our
 22 thumb on this question, right?
 23 MR. BERGER: That's correct, Justice Scalia --
 24 QUESTION: And --
 25 MR. BERGER: -- and I think that's the more

5 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 typical kind of moratorium, and the kind that most of the
 2 amici on the agency's side have been talking about.
 3 QUESTION: There was one Minnesota moratorium
 4 that was -- seemed somewhat like this that had been
 5 sustained by, I think the Minnesota appellate court.
 6 MR. BERGER: There was one, Your Honor, and I
 7 would submit that that court erred. It happens. Lower
 8 courts do that sometimes.
 9 (Laughter.)
 10 MR. BERGER: And we believe that --
 11 QUESTION: So we notice.
 12 (Laughter.)
 13 MR. BERGER: And we believe that that simply is
 14 not an appropriate precedent for this Court to follow.
 15 QUESTION: Why, why is it -- I guess this is
 16 going to be your basic point. Why is it the case -- let's
 17 take not this moratorium, but let's take a moratorium that
 18 lasts for a year, and after that time everyone believes
 19 the board will allow certain kinds of development. Other
 20 things being equal, that year of no use would probably
 21 have reduced the value of the land by 5, 10 percent. Now,
 22 so why, since that's the effect of the moratorium I'm
 23 imagining, should the public have to give compensation for
 24 that small diminution in value?
 25 MR. BERGER: Because it's not the diminution in

6 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 value we're talking about here, Your Honor. It's the
 2 total elimination of the ability to make use of the
 3 property, and in all of this Court's cases you have talked
 4 about denial of economically productive use of land, and
 5 what we're doing here, and what you're talking about in
 6 your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, is taking away the
 7 right to use that land.
 8 It's as if I took away your car for a year and I
 9 parked it in the garage and I kept good care of it, and I
 10 returned it to you at the end of the year with no
 11 diminution in value whatsoever, or perhaps the 5 percent
 12 that Your Honor hypothesized. You still would have been
 13 without the use of that car for a year, and I think that
 14 you would be entitled to compensation for the fact that I
 15 deprived you of the use of that car.
 16 QUESTION: Well, certainly if the respondent
 17 here had simply said, we're going to need your property
 18 for 3 years, and so we're going to take a leasehold
 19 interest for 3 years, the respondent would have had to
 20 compensate for that.
 21 MR. BERGER: Chief Justice, I couldn't agree
 22 with that more, and I believe that that is in fact what
 23 we're dealing with here.
 24 QUESTION: No, but you're -- it seems to me
 25 you're not dealing with that here, because in that

7 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 hypothetical the person, the third party in fact takes the
 2 property in the sense of using it for that party's own
 3 benefit. Here, no one, the Tahoe Regional Planning
 4 Authority isn't using the property for its benefit. It's
 5 saying that during this period of time there are some
 6 things that you can't do.
 7 MR. BERGER: That's true, Justice Souter, but
 8 frankly I don't see the difference between them, because
 9 the Government --
 10 QUESTION: Well, one difference is that the
 11 person taking in the one hypothetical gets a considerable
 12 personal value, i.e., the use of a car, or the use of
 13 property for a period of time. There's no such fact in
 14 evidence here.
 15 MR. BERGER: Absolutely true, but this Court's
 16 jurisprudence has always examined cases like this from the
 17 impact on the property owner, not from what the Government
 18 gains by the taking. Justice Holmes said that in the
 19 Boston Chamber of Commerce case a century ago.
 20 QUESTION: Isn't your argument, and wasn't your
 21 answer to Justice Breyer's question in effect to invoke
 22 the kind of standard language which has come out of the
 23 Lucas case? In other words, it is preventing all use of
 24 the property, or all economically productive use of the
 25 property, and yet Lucas garaged that phrase in the

8 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 circumstance in which the denial of economic use was
 2 assumed to be permanent.
 3 Here, we're dealing with a situation -- Justice
 4 Breyer's question dealt with a situation in which the
 5 deprivation is assumed to be temporary, so that it does
 6 make sense in his hypothetical to say, well, it reduces
 7 the value of the property during the interim period maybe
 8 by 10 percent. That is a very different economic fact
 9 from an indefinite, permanent deprivation which would
 10 reduce the economic value of the property down to
 11 something close to zero, and doesn't that distinction have
 12 to be recognized, and isn't that the reason why the Lucas
 13 formula simply cannot be used uncritically in this
 14 circumstance?
 15 MR. BERGER: Justice Souter, I believe that that
 16 distinction gets recognized at the valuation phase, not at
 17 the liability phase. In other words, taking for a small
 18 period of time, or for less than the full life of the
 19 property, would be compensated less than taking the full
 20 fee interest.
 21 QUESTION: Yes, but what you're really saying
 22 is, if the -- I think, that if in Justice Breyer's
 23 hypothetical there is a diminution in the value for this
 24 period of 10 percent, that you've got to compensate for
 25 the full 10 percent, and it seems to me that our cases are

9 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 pretty clear in saying, that's not how you measure the
 2 compensation obligation. That's the -- that's an example
 3 of taking, you know, the one stick out of the bundle and
 4 saying because you can't use that one, you've got to
 5 compensate 100 percent for that one, but I think our cases
 6 rule that out, don't they?
 7 MR. BERGER: Actually, your cases in quite a
 8 number of different circumstances say that if you do take
 9 one important stick out of the bundle, you may well have
 10 taken the property --
 11 QUESTION: Permanently. Permanently.
 12 MR. BERGER: Well, except in First English, Your
 13 Honor, where this Court expressly said, and examined all
 14 the cases, that temporary takings are constitutionally no
 15 different than permanent takings.
 16 QUESTION: Well, except that that gets to the
 17 argument that the other side makes throughout here, that
 18 the assumption of that statement was that we had a taking
 19 in the first place, whereas the issue in this case is
 20 whether we do have a taking.
 21 MR. BERGER: Well, that's correct, and what
 22 we're talking about here is a deprivation of all use. 
 23 That's why we have a pretty clean case for the Court to
 24 deal with here.
 25 QUESTION: It's a deprivation of all use if you

10 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 fit it into Lucas.
 2 Lucas was a case that did not involve a
 3 permanent taking, so that it seems to me your first
 4 argument has got to be not that the Lucas formula can
 5 apply here, but that the Lucas formula should apply here
 6 as opposed to this Penn Central formula. You've got to do
 7 that in order to get into First English.
 8 MR. BERGER: I agree with that completely, but I
 9 think that what we're dealing with, if you examine the
 10 facts of the case, is that from the time that these
 11 ordinances were enacted in 1981 until whatever end point
 12 you want to look at, there was a total deprivation of use.
 13 QUESTION: Well, Mr. Berger, you may well have
 14 been able to prevail under the Penn Central approach, I
 15 assume, viewed in its entirety over this period of time,
 16 but that was waived. Am I correct in that?
 17 MR. BERGER: We did not present a Penn Central
 18 case, that's correct.
 19 QUESTION: And all you want is this pure and
 20 simple per se taking, as applied to, as it comes to us,
 21 what is it, a 3-year period?
 22 MR. BERGER: Well, there was this 3-year period
 23 chopped out at the beginning of the time.
 24 QUESTION: And that's what we're focused on here
 25 as the case actually comes to us?

11 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BERGER: That appears to be what the Court
 2 is interested in, as the Court reframed the question.
 3 QUESTION: May I ask you this question, Mr.
 4 Berger? Just looking at temporary takings, and just
 5 looking at the liability stage as opposed to the valuation
 6 stage, is there a distinction in your view between a
 7 regulatory taking and a physical taking?
 8 MR. BERGER: I don't believe so, Justice
 9 Stevens. I think that this Court did deal with that in
 10 the First English case, and it explained that physical
 11 takings and regulatory takings are judged by the same
 12 constitutional standards.
 13 QUESTION: So that in your view -- of course,
 14 the physical taking, even for 10 minutes, would be a
 15 taking. There's no doubt about that. But your view is,
 16 even if the regulation prohibits all use of a piece of
 17 property, an automobile, whatever it may be, for 10 or 15
 18 minutes, there is a taking. The damages may be
 19 infinitesimal, but there's always -- past the liability
 20 stage.
 21 MR. BERGER: If there is a total prohibition of
 22 use --
 23 QUESTION: For 10 minutes.
 24 MR. BERGER: -- there is liability. Now --
 25 QUESTION: So --

12 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Mr. Berger, can you reconcile the
 2 different approach that this Court has said goes for
 3 spatial separation, like the air space in Penn Central,
 4 and time segregation? It seems to me that if the one --
 5 if Penn Central is the regime for splitting off the air
 6 rights, it should also be the regime for splitting off a
 7 discrete period of time.
 8 MR. BERGER: Your Honor, this Court and other
 9 courts have always dealt with the time value of property,
 10 if I may, differently than they have in these spatial
 11 terms. The fact is, leasehold interests, future interests
 12 have always been recognized as independent items of
 13 property that are independently protected by the
 14 Constitution.
 15 If you had a piece of property that had a
 16 landlord and a tenant and a lender and some remainder
 17 person --
 18 QUESTION: But these are all physical takings.
 19 MR. BERGER: -- with all interests, and it was
 20 condemned, all of them would be entitled to compensation.
 21 QUESTION: But that's --
 22 QUESTION: These are all physical takings cases.
 23 MR. BERGER: And this Court has said in First
 24 English that there is no difference constitutionally,
 25 Justice Stevens, between the physical takings and the

13 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 regulatory takings.
 2 QUESTION: Suppose I --
 3 QUESTION: What do you do about the fact that
 4 there is a regulatory taking of sorts whenever you have a
 5 permit system, let's say the normal zoning regime in which
 6 you cannot construct any building on your acreage without
 7 first applying and getting the approval of the zoning
 8 agency?
 9 MR. BERGER: Justice Scalia --
 10 QUESTION: During that period, there's been a
 11 total taking. You cannot do anything with that property
 12 until you get the building approved.
 13 MR. BERGER: Clearly you cannot do anything
 14 until you've gotten the property approved, but it seems to
 15 me that there is a fundamental difference between a
 16 landowner working through a system whose end product is,
 17 at least theoretically and probably very likely, the
 18 issuance of a permit to go ahead and develop something
 19 that is economically productive on that land as opposed to
 20 being stuck in a system where you're forbidden --
 21 QUESTION: But that would have been during that
 22 interval of time it meets your test. Nothing can be done
 23 until the permit issues, so a fortiori, under your theory,
 24 compensation due.
 25 MR. BERGER: I don't believe so, Justice

14 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 O'Connor, because --
 2 QUESTION: Well, that's what it sounds like.
 3 Now, what about your basic zoning law? I'm
 4 going to, as a city, limit the use of this property to one
 5 house per acre. You can't have unlimited apartments or
 6 commercial property owner. Now, for the enactment of
 7 that, is there a taking immediately?
 8 MR. BERGER: No, Your Honor.
 9 QUESTION: Well, you're permanently deprived of
 10 the use of it for commercial purposes.
 11 MR. BERGER: Yes, Your Honor, but you are not
 12 totally deprived of the use of it.
 13 QUESTION: But can we get back to the basic
 14 question that Justice Scalia asked, and Justice O'Connor
 15 asked it as well. I want your answer. Why is it that a
 16 delay for purposes of ordinary zoning, which, let's
 17 assume, prohibits you from any use of the property, is not
 18 a taking?
 19 MR. BERGER: Because you are there in a process
 20 working toward the actual development of the process, of
 21 the property, pardon me, in contrast to being in a
 22 situation like these people are, where there is no process
 23 for development. There is instead the desire --
 24 QUESTION: Let's assume that the Tahoe Regional
 25 Planning Agency thought, in good faith, that there would

15 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 be some development allowed, but they needed a year to
 2 think about it. My -- that's the same as the World Trade
 3 Center hypothetical. We know something very valuable is
 4 going to be built, but you say it's a taking, and I don't
 5 understand the difference between that and the regular
 6 zoning procedure.
 7 MR. BERGER: The difference is that in the
 8 second situation there is a conscious and total
 9 prohibition on use, and that's the purpose of the
 10 regulation, is to prohibit the use. In the former
 11 situation, where you're applying for a permit, the purpose
 12 of the regulation is not to prohibit use but, in fact, to
 13 enable use.
 14 QUESTION: Well then, it seems to me you have to
 15 change your answer about the World Trade Center
 16 hypothetical, where you say there's going to be a very
 17 valuable use, we just don't know what it is, but we need a
 18 year to think about it, in addition to the normal -- and
 19 you told me that was taking, but now your rationale seems
 20 to me to back away from that.
 21 MR. BERGER: If they are in a process where
 22 there will be development at the end, then I believe that
 23 there is not an automatic per se taking, but it seems to
 24 me that what we're dealing with, if we've got a total use
 25 prohibition, we do have a taking. It's a question of

16 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 time.
 2 QUESTION: But Mr. Berger, your -- it seems to
 3 me your deciding whether the temporary taking is --
 4 whether the temporary interference is a taking or not
 5 depends on what's going to happen after the temporary
 6 period expires, because in one situation you think, well,
 7 they know they're going to get something valuable out of
 8 it, in the other they don't, but that means that the test
 9 for the temporary period turns entirely on an evaluation
 10 of the future.
 11 MR. BERGER: Well, if I made it sound that way,
 12 Justice Stevens, I apologize. I -- what I'm saying is
 13 that you have two different schemes set up. One is a
 14 process leading toward development. The other is a
 15 process of total blockage, and where the intent of the
 16 Government is simply to block the use of property. We're
 17 not looking at the future --
 18 QUESTION: Well, you're not suggesting they're
 19 doing it just for the sole purpose of blocking the use. 
 20 Don't they have some ultimate goal in sight here?
 21 MR. BERGER: Sometimes they may. Sometimes they
 22 don't.
 23 QUESTION: But your -- you rest on the
 24 hypothesis that they are just interested in a total
 25 blockage for a temporary period of time, and they don't

17 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 care what happens later.
 2 MR. BERGER: But that is the fact that we're
 3 dealing with. We're dealing with --
 4 QUESTION: They don't have any interest in
 5 protecting the lake?
 6 MR. BERGER: We have no question about their
 7 ability to protect the lake. The question is how they do
 8 that, and what they've decided to do in order to protect
 9 the lake is to prohibit these people from making any use
 10 of their land.
 11 QUESTION: But it seems to me in effect -- maybe
 12 this is a variant on Justice Stevens' question -- that
 13 you're saying, what's really wrong here is that this is
 14 not done in good faith, that this is not done, let's say,
 15 in the case of the period of time necessary to get
 16 permits, with an actual development in mind. This is
 17 called a moratorium, but they mean something more than
 18 just moratorium, they just mean stop, period, and it
 19 sounds to me as though you're making it turn on whether
 20 it's good faith or bad faith.
 21 MR. BERGER: Oh, I don't think it needs to. I
 22 think, in fact, in this case, when they put this
 23 moratorium in the context not of -- they don't even call
 24 it a moratorium. They did this as amendments to their
 25 Water Quality Act. What they said was, these properties

18 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 need to be kept frozen in order to protect the clarity of
 2 Lake Tahoe.
 3 QUESTION: And your argument in effect contrasts
 4 that with an existing permit system whereby if you comply
 5 with certain requirements you will ultimately end up with
 6 a permit, the purpose of which is to make sure you do
 7 comply with the requirements.
 8 MR. BERGER: Exactly, Chief Justice.
 9 QUESTION: But you still have -- I mean, in the
 10 one case the regulating agency has said, you can't do
 11 anything with your land while we're thinking about the
 12 scheme we're going to adopt, and in the other case the
 13 agency has said, just as categorically, you can't do
 14 anything with your land while we consider your
 15 application. In both cases they're, for a later
 16 regulatory purpose they're both saying, you can't do
 17 anything with your land.
 18 MR. BERGER: Justice Scalia, in a sense that is
 19 certainly true, but in the case of the processing of a
 20 permit application, we know that there is permitted use. 
 21 It's there. It's in the books.
 22 QUESTION: Not during the pendency. Not while
 23 the application is pending.
 24 MR. BERGER: The regulations of the agency say
 25 that for this property there is permitted use. The

19 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 question is how you make that use, and under what
 2 conditions and circumstances, not whether there will be
 3 use at all, where you have in the second situation a total
 4 prohibition on use and we don't know what's going to
 5 happen at the end of that total prohibition on use.
 6 The key to it may be this case itself, where the
 7 light at the end of the tunnel that they keep touting as
 8 the saving grace of this kind of a regulatory regime
 9 turned out to be no light at all. There was a complete
 10 continuation of the use prohibition when this temporary
 11 so-called period ended.
 12 QUESTION: Well, under your theory it would seem
 13 that -- suppose that a building catches fire and is
 14 substantially destroyed by fire, and the fire department
 15 comes, and the police department, and they block it off
 16 for a period of time, no use while this is investigated,
 17 none, property owner can do nothing, can't enter it,
 18 you're out of there. I guess the city or the governing
 19 jurisdiction would have to pay the property owner.
 20 MR. BERGER: I don't think at that point, Your
 21 Honor, that that would be a taking.
 22 QUESTION: But it fits squarely within your
 23 argument.
 24 MR. BERGER: No, I think that in that case, Your
 25 Honor, you would at least be entitled to perhaps some

20 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 nuisance examination. You've got a wrecked building that
 2 is a hazard, and at least the Government would have the
 3 ability to order the property cleaned up before anything
 4 else could be done with it, and I think in those
 5 circumstances --
 6 QUESTION: But that seems to make the question
 7 whether there's a taking turn on the nature of the motive
 8 of the -- underlying the regulation or the prohibition,
 9 and I thought your position was, regardless of the good
 10 faith and the great public interest in doing it, the State
 11 has to pay when it does this.
 12 MR. BERGER: Your Honor, I think we all have to
 13 live with what this Court called the nuisance exception
 14 when it decided the Lucas case, and that there are some
 15 things that the Government can do that prohibit all use
 16 that are not compensatory.
 17 QUESTION: Are you satisfied with the standard
 18 that says, every Government regulation is a candidate for
 19 a taking, just as every speech act is a First Amendment
 20 candidate, but it's actually a taking in this area only
 21 when the impact of the Government regulation is not part
 22 of a reasonable process looking towards a reasonable form
 23 of regulated development?
 24 MR. BERGER: I think I could accept that,
 25 Justice Breyer.

21 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Well, if that's so, they're going to
 2 say they win, because they're going to say, of course,
 3 this was an effort, reasonably, to regulate Lake Tahoe
 4 over a period of time. It's very complicated, it didn't
 5 last -- it lasted a long time, but no more than necessary.
 6 MR. BERGER: Oh, I would disagree with that
 7 characterization. This was not an effort to regulate Lake
 8 Tahoe. This was an effort to prevent the use of these
 9 properties. Certainly they --
 10 QUESTION: But that's a reasonableness
 11 calculation, and that's the Penn Central aspect rather
 12 than the more categorical approach that you're urging upon
 13 us, I should think.
 14 MR. BERGER: Your Honor, if they had come up
 15 with a nuanced, subtle regulation that had something to it
 16 other than the meat ax approach that the agency took in
 17 this case, I think you would have a Penn Central-type
 18 analysis, but what we've got in this case is not anything
 19 subtle at all. We've got a complete, easy, quick
 20 prohibition, and --
 21 QUESTION: What is the status today? What is
 22 it, 22 years later?
 23 MR. BERGER: We're 22 years later.
 24 QUESTION: What's the status today of the
 25 properties affected by this suit?

22 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BERGER: The clients that I represent are
 2 still, for the most part, unable to do anything. There is
 3 the new plan put in in 1987, which this Court looked at in
 4 the Suitum case, and some of the people, those in the
 5 position of Mrs. Suitum, in the stream environment zones,
 6 are still totally prohibited from using their land. Most
 7 of the people are still totally prohibited from using
 8 their land.
 9 A large number of them have sold their land to
 10 Government agencies that were buying them up at bargain
 11 basement prices, at nothing approaching what would, an
 12 appraiser would call fair market value, but the value of
 13 land that couldn't be developed, in order to mitigate
 14 their losses, and as the court approved in the Del Monte
 15 Dunes case, what they'd like to do is to make themselves
 16 whole.
 17 QUESTION: Well, is it your position that all of
 18 the properties involved in this petition are, today, still
 19 totally deprived of any use whatever?
 20 MR. BERGER: I believe, Justice O'Connor, there
 21 may be a handful of them that under the 1987 plan, and the
 22 regulations that came under that in 1989, were finally
 23 released and allowed to do something, but it's only a
 24 small number, and for the most part these properties are
 25 still unused and unusable.

23 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Is it your position that the
 2 application of the Penn Central approach would not result
 3 in appropriate compensation determinations at the end of
 4 the day?
 5 MR. BERGER: I don't know that, Your Honor. As
 6 a pragmatic matter, doing a Penn Central approach on a
 7 case that involves hundreds and hundreds of individual
 8 properties would have been a nightmarish litigation that
 9 only the wealthiest of landowners would be able to afford
 10 and, particularly in light of the clear prohibition of use
 11 that they decided that they needed, we thought that it
 12 made more sense to do a Lucas-type approach than a Penn
 13 Central approach in this case.
 14 QUESTION: May I just ask this one question? 
 15 With regard to those who have subsequently been permitted
 16 to develop their land, it's your view that you're
 17 nevertheless entitled to a takings compensation for the
 18 period which the moratorium was in effect?
 19 MR. BERGER: Yes --
 20 QUESTION: Yes.
 21 MR. BERGER: -- Justice Stevens, that's true.
 22 I'd like to reserve the rest of my time, Mr.
 23 Chief Justice, if I may.
 24 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Berger.
 25 Mr. Roberts.

24 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.
 2 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
 3 MR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
 4 may it please the Court:
 5 Petitioners' only takings claim before the court
 6 of appeals and his only -- their only takings claim before
 7 this Court is a facial per se claim. That means that
 8 their contention is that the mere enactment of the
 9 temporary moratorium in this case effected a taking with
 10 respect to every parcel to which it applied -- that's the
 11 facial aspect -- without any consideration of the reasons
 12 for the moratorium. That's the per se aspect. And what
 13 is more, that bold claim is limited at this point to the
 14 temporary moratorium in effect from August '81 until April
 15 1984.
 16 QUESTION: Mr. Roberts, you described it as a
 17 bold claim. Supposing it had gone on for 10 years.
 18 MR. ROBERTS: In 10 --
 19 QUESTION: Would it be still bold?
 20 MR. ROBERTS: On the facial aspect I think so,
 21 Your Honor. I think doing the Penn Central analysis and
 22 not the Lucas analysis, so long as it's not a permanent
 23 deprivation abuse.
 24 Now, certainly a 10-year claim would have a much
 25 harder row to hoe against a takings challenge, but I would

25 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 like to know the impact on the property's value, why the
 2 10 years was necessary, if it was, the sorts of things
 3 that are factored under Penn Central.
 4 QUESTION: Well, you could do a Penn Central --
 5 you could have done Penn Central in Lucas. I mean, Penn
 6 Central is wonderful. We could apply it to everything,
 7 but as Mr. Berger pointed out, that's a terribly
 8 complicated analysis, enormously expensive for property
 9 owners to have to go through, which is why you have cases
 10 like Lucas.
 11 MR. ROBERTS: This Court said Lucas applied only
 12 in the rare circumstance, a total ban on economic
 13 reproductive use.
 14 QUESTION: Suppose I take a 3-year leasehold,
 15 right. The Government comes in and says, we're taking
 16 this property for 3 years, not a permanent taking, just a
 17 3-year taking.
 18 MR. ROBERTS: That --
 19 QUESTION: We do a Penn Central analysis of
 20 that?
 21 MR. ROBERTS: Oh, no. If the Government
 22 condemns a leasehold, that's a taking, and compensation is
 23 due.
 24 QUESTION: All right, suppose in this case that
 25 one of these barred owners leased the property to someone

26 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 who's going to put a mobile home on it for a year, the
 2 moratorium comes in effect, assume the mobile home can't
 3 be -- is that a taking of the leasehold, of the
 4 lessee's --
 5 MR. ROBERTS: No.
 6 QUESTION: -- interest?
 7 MR. ROBERTS: No. You don't sever up the
 8 property interest and -- so that it corresponds to the
 9 extent of the regulation and then say --
 10 QUESTION: You're taking from the lessee. 
 11 That's all he's got.
 12 MR. ROBERTS: Well, the right at issue here is
 13 the right to build residences, to develop the property.
 14 QUESTION: No. My hypothetical is that it
 15 applies to a mobile home and the guy who leases for -- the
 16 lot for a year, and then TRPA says you can't put the
 17 mobile home on there for a year. They take this entire
 18 leasehold. Compensable?
 19 MR. ROBERTS: It would first of all be under the
 20 Penn Central analysis, and the economic impact --
 21 QUESTION: Why, if it's a total taking?
 22 QUESTION: General Motors certainly didn't do
 23 Penn Central.
 24 MR. ROBERTS: No, but the other -- the
 25 distinction is the one this Court talked about in Loretto,

27 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 between -- you mentioned the World War II condemnation
 2 cases. The Pee Wee Coal case, the Government came in and
 3 occupied the coal mine to prevent a strike. That was a
 4 taking. In Central Eureka they said, you cannot use the
 5 gold mine, and this Court said, that's different, that's
 6 not a taking.
 7 That's the type of distinction that we're
 8 talking about here between physical appropriation or,
 9 extended to Lucas, a ban on total economic use, and the
 10 temporary regulation that's at issue here. Because the
 11 regulation is temporary, the land retains economic value.
 12 QUESTION: I'm still not sure of your answer. 
 13 Your answer is that in my hypothetical about the 1-year
 14 lease that's taken from the lessee, it has to be a Penn
 15 Central analysis because?
 16 MR. ROBERTS: Because you're starting out with a
 17 property -- presumably the regulation applies to the
 18 property generally, and it just so happens that this one
 19 parcel has been severed out into a leasehold, and in doing
 20 that, that is a question that has to be addressed before
 21 you get to the analysis, should you sever out the affected
 22 property interest to a leasehold.
 23 QUESTION: But you could have made that same
 24 argument in General Motors, and I think the Government
 25 did, that you shouldn't just treat it as a leasehold,

28 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 you've got to value the whole property. The court says
 2 no, there was a leasehold in effect, that's what the
 3 Government took, that's what the Government has to pay
 4 for.
 5 MR. ROBERTS: But if -- if this Court is -- in
 6 its past takings cases, when it's been presented with a
 7 regulation that applies to a discrete property interest,
 8 it hasn't said, well, let's redefine the effective
 9 property interests to that. It didn't do it in Penn
 10 Central, it didn't do it in Keystone Bituminous, and it
 11 didn't do it in the construction laborers case.
 12 The way the property was held by the petitioners
 13 in this case is fee simple. This regulation applied to
 14 fee simple property. It did not affect the value anywhere
 15 near the extent that the regulation in Lucas did.
 16 QUESTION: No, but just to make it clear, in my
 17 hypothetical -- I know it didn't happen, but in my
 18 hypothetical, no recovery because?
 19 MR. ROBERTS: No, I'm not sure it's no recovery,
 20 but I am sure that it's still evaluated under Penn
 21 Central, because --
 22 QUESTION: But Mr. Roberts, if you evaluate it
 23 under Penn Central, would it be legitimate to evaluate it
 24 this way. I've assumed it would be, but maybe I'm wrong. 
 25 Assume that the leasehold is not physically taken, so that

29 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the Government doesn't substitute itself for the trailer
 2 owner and use the property. It's strictly a prohibition
 3 of use. I assumed that under Penn Central the lessee
 4 would have his claim against the lessor because the lessor
 5 was not delivering. The lessor would not have a claim for
 6 a permanent deprivation here because there, with respect
 7 to the lessor there would only be the temporary taking.
 8 MR. ROBERTS: Well --
 9 QUESTION: So that the lessee would probably
 10 come out okay against a different party. The lessor would
 11 be in the same position that the lessor would be in if
 12 there had never been a lease. Is that the way it would
 13 work?
 14 MR. ROBERTS: Well, presumably the impact of
 15 regulation would be something that would be addressed in
 16 the lease agreement itself.
 17 QUESTION: Yes.
 18 MR. ROBERTS: I mean, if they were leasing it to
 19 build a mobile home and it turns out they can't, who bears
 20 the responsibility for that, again a matter between the
 21 lessor and the lessee.
 22 The important point is that the, what the
 23 petitioners are arguing for is an extension of the Lucas
 24 rule which applied in a, as the Court said, the rare
 25 circumstance in which all economic use is prohibited, and

30 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the Court emphasized in Lucas that that had the
 2 consequence of rendering the property valueless. This is
 3 how the Court phrased the question presented in Lucas,
 4 whether the act's dramatic effect on the economic value of
 5 Lucas' lot accomplished a taking.
 6 Well, here, there is no dramatic effect on the
 7 economic value of the affected lots, because we're talking
 8 about temporary regulation for a limited time.
 9 QUESTION: Well, but does --
 10 QUESTION: Well, in light of what's happened, we
 11 know it's been 22 years, and presumably many of these
 12 properties will never be allowed to be developed. Is
 13 there no end in sight? Can we not look at that as a
 14 taking?
 15 MR. ROBERTS: First, Your Honor, my
 16 understanding of the record is quite different from my
 17 brother's. If you look at the pretrial order, Exhibit A,
 18 pretrial order filed July 17, 1998, it describes the
 19 situations with respect to each of the properties. Most
 20 of them have been sold long ago. Of those that are not
 21 sold, two-thirds have a score that makes them buildable
 22 under the '87 plan, so two-thirds of the petitioners who
 23 still own property can build on those lots according to
 24 the record in this case, and that is just petitioners'
 25 allegations.

31 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: When you say sold, do you mean at the
 2 bargain price that Mr. Berger referred to, sold to --
 3 MR. ROBERTS: Sold typically to the Government
 4 buy-out agencies, I wouldn't say at a bargain price.
 5 QUESTION: Sold to the Government agencies who
 6 will do with it just exactly what is achieved by the
 7 Government's not taking position of it, that is, nothing. 
 8 I find this distinction between whether the Government
 9 takes possession of the land versus whether the Government
 10 doesn't take possession of the land quite unrealistic --
 11 MR. ROBERTS: Well --
 12 QUESTION: -- where you're talking about a
 13 Government that wants to assure that the land lies fallow. 
 14 The Government achieves entirely what it wants by simply
 15 saying, nobody shall do anything with the land. That --
 16 why should the Government condemn the land? It doesn't
 17 have to.
 18 MR. ROBERTS: That's not, of course, what we're
 19 talking about here. What we're talking about here is a
 20 time-out for a limited period while the agency carries out
 21 its responsibility to determine what can be done with the
 22 land.
 23 QUESTION: All right, so how does he prove that? 
 24 What about the one-third who could never build?
 25 MR. ROBERTS: Well --

32 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: What happens to them? What is your
 2 view of the correct thing he should have done? Is a
 3 person who never is allowed to build, and never can use
 4 the property at all, simply out of luck, if what they say
 5 is we're having a 10-year, a 30-year procedure of 3-year
 6 moratoriums, 10 at a time or something like that? How is
 7 it supposed to work, in your opinion?
 8 MR. ROBERTS: Well, the first thing I'd say is,
 9 you bring an as-applied claim and not a facial claim. The
 10 facial claim is the mere enactment of this temporary
 11 moratorium effective taking. Well then, don't talk to me
 12 about what happened 15 years later, if the mere enactment
 13 of the temporary moratorium is your complaint. That's a
 14 different case, and he brought that case, and it was
 15 thrown out because it was too late.
 16 There were challenges brought to the '84 plan,
 17 there were challenges brought to the '87 plan. Those
 18 challenges failed, and now the effort is to link those
 19 challenges up to what's left, the little tail on the dog
 20 of this temporary moratorium that started the process.
 21 QUESTION: How does an as-applied challenge go? 
 22 What if you make an as-applied challenge. What would you
 23 have to prove? Would you have to prove that any
 24 intelligent agency could make up its mind and, you know,
 25 either fish or cut bait within a year? Suppose --

33 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ROBERTS: If the as-applied challenge is to
 2 the temporary moratorium?
 3 QUESTION: Yes.
 4 MR. ROBERTS: Well, you go through the Penn
 5 Central factors, and if it's taking too long, that's
 6 certainly something pertinent on the character of the
 7 Government action. That's what other courts have looked
 8 to.
 9 QUESTION: No, no, but it goes beyond Penn
 10 Central if you're no -- if it is no longer an honest
 11 moratorium to decide what you're going to do with the
 12 land, then you're out of Penn Central. Then it's just a
 13 taking. You're kidding us. You only need a year to
 14 decide what you want to do. You've imposed a moratorium
 15 for 5 years. Why should I have to go through Penn
 16 Central? Four of those years is just prohibiting me from
 17 using my land with no other governmental purpose in mind
 18 except the prohibition.
 19 MR. ROBERTS: And that's one of those things
 20 that they would have to show. Here, of course, the
 21 district court found that the planning effort was
 22 undertaken as speedily as possible.
 23 QUESTION: But you acknowledge that if, in an
 24 as-applied challenge, there's a showing that the agency
 25 does not need 3 years or 5 years or whatever, that the

34 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 thing could reasonably have been done in 1 year,
 2 everything beyond the 1 year is then a taking?
 3 MR. ROBERTS: No. You have to go through the
 4 other factors. This is not a per se analysis.
 5 QUESTION: Why?
 6 MR. ROBERTS: The other factors include the
 7 impact on the property. You're claiming a taking. What
 8 was the effect on your property?
 9 QUESTION: Well, what if -- let's take a
 10 hypothesis where the moratorium is 10 years. Now, you
 11 still go through this thing that you're talking about? It
 12 cannot be long enough ever to be a per se taking?
 13 MR. ROBERTS: Well, even the court of appeals
 14 recognized that the moratorium is long enough so that the
 15 present value of the uses that might be allowed is de
 16 minimis, then perhaps the categorical rule would apply,
 17 and 10 years seems like it's going to be too long for the
 18 Government to figure out and carry out its
 19 responsibilities and planning, but I wouldn't say that we
 20 try to find a point in time at which suddenly we shift
 21 from the accepted Penn Central analysis to the Lucas per
 22 se analysis.
 23 QUESTION: Well, but yet you agree that shift
 24 has to take place somewhere along the continuum of time.
 25 MR. ROBERTS: I guess what I'm saying is at some

35 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 point calling something a temporary moratorium is a misuse
 2 of the label. If it's 30 years, that's too long.
 3 Now, the best that Justice Holmes could do was
 4 say that when it goes too far it becomes a taking, and I
 5 may not be able to do much better, but the Penn Central
 6 factors allow consideration of things like, what is the
 7 need for it? The need may not be sufficiently compelling
 8 to justify a moratorium of 2 years, or the need may be
 9 sufficiently compelling to justify a longer moratorium. 
 10 What was the impact on your -- the property?
 11 Keep in mind, the petitioners submitted no
 12 evidence of impact on value. We have no idea from the
 13 record what the impact of the temporary moratorium was,
 14 other than the evidence that we submitted which shows that
 15 properties were sold for significant amounts of value
 16 during the period of the temporary moratorium, which makes
 17 sense.
 18 A temporary ban on development doesn't render
 19 property valueless. If you have two parcels of property,
 20 one subject to a permanent ban on use, and the other
 21 subject to a temporary ban, it is true, as some of the
 22 amici say, the permanent ban could be made temporary and
 23 the temporary ban could be made permanent, but you're not
 24 going to pay the same price for both of those parcels of
 25 property. The one that's subject to the temporary ban is

36 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 going to have a higher market value, reflecting the fact
 2 that future uses are available, or will be available or
 3 not, depending on the plan that's ultimately adopted.
 4 QUESTION: I suppose that depends on how much
 5 any prospective buyer would believe that the temporary ban
 6 is really temporary, or how much they believe that it's
 7 going to be strung out and extended, and if worst comes to
 8 worse, and the Government can't pick it up at bargain
 9 prices it will pay compensation to get rid of the land. 
 10 I --
 11 MR. ROBERTS: And that's like the petitioners'
 12 effort to link their lost challenges to the permanent land
 13 use plan to their challenge to the temporary moratorium. 
 14 QUESTION: Mr. --
 15 MR. ROBERTS: The district court --
 16 QUESTION: Excuse me. Had you finished your
 17 answer?
 18 MR. ROBERTS: I was just going to say that the
 19 district court in this case specifically found that the
 20 agency acted in good faith throughout, so the idea that
 21 the temporary moratorium to allow planning to take place
 22 was some kind of a sham for a permanent --
 23 QUESTION: Well, but it also found there was a
 24 total deprivation of use for X amount of time.
 25 MR. ROBERTS: Only looked at from that period. 

37 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Only looked at for the 32-month period, and our submission
 2 is that that's the improper way to carve up the property
 3 interest and say, oh, it's a total taking, because we're
 4 going to only look at the property that was taken.
 5 QUESTION: Mr. Roberts, in answer to one of
 6 Justice O'Connor's questions about a hypothetical fire
 7 damage case Mr. Berger referred to the nuisance exception
 8 as possibly taking the case out of the whole takings area.
 9 At what point in what procedure would the possible
 10 availability of the nuisance defense arise or be
 11 considered with respect to polluting Lake Tahoe?
 12 MR. ROBERTS: Well, we raised the claim before
 13 the court of appeals that one reason there was no taking,
 14 even if Lucas applied, was because of the nuisance, et
 15 cetera. The Court didn't find it necessary to reach that
 16 issue.
 17 QUESTION: I see.
 18 QUESTION: And so the district court said there
 19 wasn't -- that a nuisance hadn't been made out. The
 20 district court said that, didn't it?
 21 MR. ROBERTS: That's right, and we appealed
 22 that, and the court of appeals didn't find --
 23 QUESTION: And what was your argument to the
 24 court of appeals, that this was a nuisance exception?
 25 MR. ROBERTS: That given the impact on the lake

38 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 of development, that it fell within the California and
 2 Nevada nuisance requirements.
 3 QUESTION: That it all should be a park.
 4 MR. ROBERTS: Not that it should all be a park,
 5 but that further development would threaten the serious
 6 and, in fact, irreparable harm to the lake. That's the
 7 basis for the Government action in this case that the
 8 petitioners have never challenged.
 9 But I want to emphasize in concluding that it's
 10 important to remember that the issue is not whether a
 11 total ban on use for this period effects a taking. The
 12 issue is whether a temporary moratorium from August of '81
 13 to April of '84 for the purpose of carrying out the
 14 responsibility of undertaking planning with respect to
 15 these lots is on its face with respect to every lot that
 16 it applied to a per se taking without regard to the
 17 reason.
 18 QUESTION: Phrased that way, it's quite clearly
 19 in your favor, but I think they're seeing this as a group
 20 of landowners thinking from the beginning, whatever the
 21 justification for this, and the justification is
 22 excellent, saving Lake Tahoe, it's going to end up that we
 23 won't be able to use our land for anything, and we've been
 24 able to tell you that from day one, so we brought a case
 25 right off the bat that we knew that was going to happen,

39 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 and then year after year went by when people told us,
 2 maybe you'll be able to build, maybe you won't, which
 3 really wasn't so, we knew we wouldn't, and then it ended
 4 up that we couldn't, all right.
 5 Now, what are we supposed to say to them? 
 6 Aren't they supposed to have some remedy at law? And
 7 that's I think why he wanted to hear all his questions,
 8 not just one, and there is that lurking in this case, and
 9 I'm not totally sure how to deal with it.
 10 MR. ROBERTS: Well, first of all they waited
 11 until the '84 plan took effect to file their lawsuit. 
 12 That suggests to me the gripe was with the permanent ban,
 13 not so much the temporary moratorium.
 14 Second of all, the supposition in your question
 15 makes this not a facial challenge. In other words, it's
 16 not the mere enactment. It's because we know what's
 17 really going on here. That's an as-applied challenge,
 18 that's not a facial challenge, so the landowners in your
 19 case said, as, in fact, some have, bring an as-applied
 20 challenge saying, as applied to me this is a taking.
 21 QUESTION: So do you agree that a temporary
 22 moratorium that ripens into a permanent ban is a taking?
 23 I mean, you know, let's assume that I sold the
 24 property during the temporary moratorium which later
 25 ripens into a total ban, and I claim that I should have

40 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 been compensated for those 3 years that I owned the
 2 property without any ability to do -- does that constitute
 3 a taking?
 4 MR. ROBERTS: I think the period in which the
 5 agency's justification is, we need a time-out to undertake
 6 planning so that we're not locking the barn door after the
 7 horse escapes, should be evaluated separately from the
 8 period in which the agency says, this is the land use
 9 plan, and if you've got a gripe with us you can challenge
 10 that. Those are two separate periods. The character of
 11 the Government action is different in those two periods.
 12 QUESTION: Okay, let's assume that they are
 13 analyzed separately, and it is found that for the period
 14 Justice Scalia is talking about the Government really was
 15 not acting in good faith. Its plan, its intent right from
 16 that moment on, from the first day on, was to ban all
 17 development whatsoever. In that case, does he have a
 18 claim for a complete taking during the 3-year period?
 19 MR. ROBERTS: Oh, certainly, yes.
 20 QUESTION: Okay.
 21 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. I don't think it's a facial
 22 claim, because it depends on more than looking
 23 specifically at the face of the ordinance.
 24 QUESTION: So it's a question basically of good
 25 faith and intent --

41 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ROBERTS: And here the --
 2 QUESTION: -- and understanding what they're
 3 doing.
 4 MR. ROBERTS: The district court at petition
 5 appendix at page 69 said the agency acted in complete good
 6 faith, and completed its responsibilities as quickly as
 7 could be expected.
 8 Thank you, Your Honor.
 9 QUESTION: If the court of appeals opinion is
 10 just simply affirmed just as is, weren't we wasting our
 11 time in First English?
 12 MR. ROBERTS: Oh, no. First English didn't
 13 address the question of when a temporary regulation can
 14 become a taking. It said that if you have a temporary
 15 taking, and it assumed arguendo that there was a taking
 16 for a temporary period, compensation is required, and we
 17 don't dispute that at all.
 18 QUESTION: Yes, but as -- assume the court of
 19 appeals opinion is the law. First English wasn't a
 20 taking. That's your whole point.
 21 MR. ROBERTS: Well, that's what the California
 22 State courts determined on remand when they were addressed
 23 with the question.
 24 QUESTION: No, no, just talk about Federal law. 
 25 You're saying that First English could not have been a

42 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 taking, so we were just waiting our time up here.
 2 MR. ROBERTS: Oh, no, no, not at all. First
 3 English could have been a taking. It would have required
 4 an evaluation under, again, Penn Central, not Lucas, to
 5 determine whether the regulation at issue there, both the
 6 temporary and permanent, and both were at issue at
 7 different points in First English, constituted a taking.
 8 But once you assume that that was a taking, and
 9 you assume the results of that analysis, then it is a
 10 taking. Compensation is required.
 11 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Roberts.
 12 MR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Your Honor.
 13 QUESTION: General Olson, we'll hear from you.
 14 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON
 15 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
 16 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
 17 GENERAL OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 18 please the Court:
 19 The colloquy so far today seems to me to
 20 illustrate the wisdom of Justice O'Connor's comment in her
 21 concurring opinion in the Palazzolo case last June that
 22 the Court should avoid per se rules in the area of
 23 regulatory taking.
 24 Petitioners knew per se rule of takings
 25 jurisprudence, taken to its logical end, would make every

43 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 freeze in the status quo, however brief, during a
 2 permitting, planning, or rezoning process equivalent to a
 3 condemnation, to use their words --
 4 QUESTION: I don't understand it that way,
 5 General Olson. I thought Mr. Berger separated out, or at
 6 least certainly tried to separate out the normal zoning
 7 process where you're working towards a permit and a permit
 8 is realistically possible at the end of the road.
 9 GENERAL OLSON: It seems to me that's a very
 10 difficult distinction for him to make, because it requires
 11 an analysis of the nature of the Government's interest in
 12 each particular permitting process. We know that they can
 13 be short, we know that they can be long, we know that they
 14 can be comprehensive.
 15 QUESTION: I don't think that's necessarily
 16 true. I think you can segregate, at least to my
 17 satisfaction, the idea of a zoning requirement in
 18 existence -- you have to file for a permit -- and
 19 basically to show that you comply with the zoning
 20 requirements. In other words, if you're going to have
 21 zoning at all, a permit process is almost necessary as
 22 opposed to a moratorium which doesn't say, you know, look,
 23 we're going to look over your application and decide
 24 whether you can build. It simply says no, you can't
 25 build.

44 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 GENERAL OLSON: Well, what we would submit is
 2 that that zoning permitting process is part of the
 3 background principles of land use, land regulation, just
 4 as temporary moratoria have always been, that when there's 
 5 rezoning process, a process referred to by this court in
 6 the First English case, that process may have to come to a
 7 halt.
 8 The purpose for the temporary moratoria here was
 9 to allow the agency to develop a sensible plan and, as Mr.
 10 Roberts has already noted by reference to the record,
 11 there's no indication that it was not in good faith. The
 12 length of the period, 32 months, was held by the district
 13 court to be a reasonable time to accomplish the
 14 objectives. The purpose of the plan, as acknowledged by
 15 the petitioners themselves, is that the purpose for the
 16 plan was to prevent the degradation of the lake and they
 17 indicated that a slowdown -- in their brief, they
 18 mentioned in their brief that a slowdown in building
 19 permits was an appropriate governmental response to that
 20 measure.
 21 Now, in each instance the question is going to
 22 be, how long did it take, was it in good faith, what was
 23 the Government up to? Here, the Government was attempting
 24 to preserve the value that Mr. Berger's clients wanted. 
 25 They themselves purchased their property and planned to

45 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 build a home on it because of the pristine quality of the
 2 lake. They make the argument in their brief that it was
 3 being degraded, that something had to be done about it. A
 4 limit on development they say -- I think it's on page 3 of
 5 their brief -- was the logical objective to solve,
 6 approach to solve that particular problem.
 7 So what Lake Tahoe, the regional board that
 8 we're dealing with here today, was doing was saying, wait
 9 a minute, before we destroy the lake let's stop, let's
 10 have a process in which we evaluate how to solve the
 11 problem that every landowner around the lake, including
 12 the petitioners, want to have solved.
 13 QUESTION: Well, that's extraordinary. You
 14 refer to it, General Olson, as just a traditional
 15 moratorium. I don't think this is a traditional
 16 moratorium at all. I think it's quite extraordinary to
 17 just say, you know, a time out, nobody does anything with
 18 this land. I just don't think that that's the normal kind
 19 of moratorium. Nobody does anything beyond the limited
 20 use that we anticipate we will ultimately impose. It's
 21 very rare that you impose a complete prohibition of use,
 22 because that's a condemnation.
 23 GENERAL OLSON: It may be unusual, but it is not
 24 so rare. In fact, page 5 of the petitioners' brief refers
 25 to the two --

46 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Two cases, as I recall, that
 2 involve -- total, right, yes.
 3 GENERAL OLSON: Two instances, and the first one
 4 that they refer to is to aid the preparation of a
 5 comprehensive plan by precluding developers from obtaining
 6 permits that conflict with the plan being drafted. That
 7 is precisely almost the same words that were used by the
 8 legislator in connection with the compact that suggested
 9 that there ought to be a moratorium. This is the compact
 10 itself in the 1980 amendments. It specifically said that
 11 it was necessary temporarily to halt works of development
 12 in the region which might otherwise absorb the entire
 13 capability of the region for further development or direct
 14 it out of harmony with the ultimate plan.
 15 Now, if there is some challenge to the good
 16 faith of what was going on here, that is not this case. 
 17 If there's some challenge to what happened afterwards -- I
 18 think the questions Justice Stevens asked point out that,
 19 well, if there was something that was done improperly to
 20 take these people's property with respect to what happened
 21 afterwards, or how far it went, or how it affected a
 22 particular property owner, that is the Penn Central test.
 23 Now, for tactical reasons, the property owners
 24 in this case decided not to pursue a Penn Central case. 
 25 We heard here today that because it would be too expensive

47 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 and too complicated for any individual property owner to
 2 bring that case. Well, that is going to be the case every
 3 time anybody challenges Government action as a taking of a
 4 piece of property.
 5 These property owners decided to pool their
 6 interest and decide not to show what the Government's
 7 interest was, the degree of invasion in individual
 8 property rights, how much it hurt, whether or not it was
 9 in good faith and so forth, so they eschewed tactically
 10 all of those considerations.
 11 Now, instead --
 12 QUESTION: With some reason, because they
 13 couldn't use their property at all -- at all.
 14 GENERAL OLSON: They couldn't use their property
 15 at all as far as this case was concerned, and the question
 16 presented in this case, for a limited period of time while
 17 a Government agency was acting to address the problem that
 18 they acknowledge, because they acknowledge that continued
 19 development along the lines that was occurring at the time
 20 this moratorium was adopted was degrading the lake and
 21 destroying their property.
 22 QUESTION: That's fine, and that's a general
 23 social problem for which the entire society should pay.
 24 GENERAL OLSON: Well --
 25 QUESTION: If, indeed, you do need that time to

48 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 figure out what to do with the lake, why should some
 2 individuals bear the burden of that necessary pause to
 3 consider what to do?
 4 GENERAL OLSON: I submit it's the teaching of
 5 this Court that not every delay, not every intrusion on
 6 the use of property, not every incursion on property
 7 rights constitutes a taking under the Fifth Amendment.
 8 QUESTION: I understand that, but these aren't
 9 the only people who are using Lake Tahoe. They're
 10 preserving Lake Tahoe for all of the citizens of that
 11 State and for citizens of other States, for that matter.
 12 GENERAL OLSON: Well, Justice --
 13 QUESTION: And yet they're saying, since we need
 14 time to think about this, we are preventing total, total,
 15 all the use of your land for 3 years.
 16 GENERAL OLSON: Well --
 17 QUESTION: I don't see that it seems to me fair
 18 that these people should bear the whole brunt of the
 19 moratorium.
 20 GENERAL OLSON: They haven't established that
 21 they have bore the whole brunt. They haven't established
 22 the degree to which their individual property rights were
 23 violated, or the extent of their intrusion. They haven't
 24 done all of the things that this Court --
 25 QUESTION: They've certainly established a

49 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 common situation. That is, every one of them, presumably,
 2 was prevented from using the property for 3 years.
 3 GENERAL OLSON: Because the use of that
 4 property, as they acknowledge, would have destroyed the
 5 very property rights that they're here seeking to
 6 vindicate, and what we're saying is that in many different
 7 situations the Government might have lots of reasons,
 8 local governments, State governments, Federal Governments,
 9 to cause a pause in the development.
 10 Now, what --
 11 QUESTION: I agree with that, and that's what
 12 worries me.
 13 GENERAL OLSON: That's right, and --
 14 QUESTION: That's exactly what worries me.
 15 GENERAL OLSON: And that's why this Court in the
 16 Penn Central case gave an opportunity to use a reasoned
 17 decisionmaking to solve the problem, to find out how far
 18 is too far. To ask that very question that Justice Holmes
 19 did is to entertain the answer. We need to know how -- in
 20 order to determine how far is too far, this Court has said
 21 repeatedly we need to look at the circumstances.
 22 What -- the rule that petitioners are proposing
 23 interdicts that judicial fact-finding, reasoned
 24 decisionmaking process. What it also does is cause the
 25 permitting agency, the Lake Tahoe Regional Planning Board,

50 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to try to do this on a permit-by-permit, quasi-
 2 adjudicative process, as opposed to what they did do, as
 3 instructed by Congress, a legislative process in which
 4 things would stop, reasoned decisionmaking would take
 5 place --
 6 QUESTION: Well, no one is challenging their
 7 authority in the sense of acting for the Government, but
 8 the fact that they were instructed to do it by Congress
 9 doesn't make it any more or any less of a taking.
 10 GENERAL OLSON: Well, I understand that,
 11 Mr. Chief Justice, but what I'm saying is that the
 12 Government agencies that looked at this problem decided
 13 that it had to be solved in a global way. This was
 14 Government acting in a way we want it to act, in a
 15 legislative process with transparency to look at the whole
 16 problem and, if there had been a taking because it was too
 17 long, or too much of an intrusion, there is a remedy under
 18 the Fifth Amendment and it's described, how you get to
 19 that remedy is described in this Court's jurisprudence in
 20 the Penn Central case. The petitioners here sought not to
 21 pursue that remedy.
 22 QUESTION: May I ask, do you understand your
 23 opponent to be arguing that a curfew would be a taking?
 24 GENERAL OLSON: A taking -- well, a curfew --
 25 QUESTION: I remember in Honolulu during the war

51 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 you couldn't go out after certain hours of the night, and
 2 so the property was totally useless when the curfew --
 3 would that be a taking under --
 4 GENERAL OLSON: Well, I think that they're
 5 arguing that any momentary suspension of the use of
 6 property would be a taking.
 7 QUESTION: So it would be.
 8 QUESTION: Thirteenth Amendment.
 9 Mr. Berger, you have 4 minutes remaining.
 10 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL M. BERGER
 11 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
 12 MR. BERGER: Thank you, Your Honor. Let me
 13 touch briefly on a couple of things, if I might.
 14 First, General Olson talked about this Court's
 15 cases that generally have built on the question of, we
 16 can't tell how far the regulation goes until we know how
 17 far they went. Well, that's true, and in this case we
 18 know precisely how far they went. They totally prohibited
 19 the use of all of the property owners who are here in
 20 front of this Court, and it's that question that we're
 21 here to answer. When we know how far they went, we don't
 22 need to get into any detailed, factual investigation of
 23 other circumstances.
 24 Justice Kennedy asked about the First English
 25 case, and whether the Court wasted its time there if the

52 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Ninth Circuit's opinion in this case is simply affirmed,
 2 and I would have to conclude that that is indeed what
 3 happened. The clear message of merely affirming what the
 4 Ninth Circuit did in this case would be to tell all the
 5 lower courts that they need to pay no attention to First
 6 English, because this Court laid out a lot of clear
 7 messages in the First English decision that the Ninth
 8 Circuit paid no attention to, and --
 9 QUESTION: But it also said we merely hold --
 10 this is from First English, stating the holding. We
 11 merely hold that where the Government's activities have
 12 already worked a taking of all use of property, no
 13 subsequent action by the Government can relieve it of the
 14 duty to provide compensation for the period during which
 15 the taking was effective.
 16 MR. BERGER: Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg, that
 17 is true, and -- but what the Court said in First English
 18 was that we're limiting, you were limiting the case to
 19 what you called the facts presented in that case, and the
 20 facts presented in that case were a temporary moratorium
 21 for about the same length of time as the one that we're
 22 dealing with here, which froze all use of that property
 23 and, in fact, in my belief had a better justification for
 24 it, because it had a health and safety justification,
 25 which this one doesn't.

53 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 As you, justice Ginsburg, pointed out, the trial
 2 court examined at great length the question of whether
 3 these people were creating a nuisance and concluded that
 4 there was no nuisance created here. As much as he was
 5 concerned about the fact that continued development around
 6 Lake Tahoe might change the color of the lake, there was
 7 no health problem with changing the color of the lake. 
 8 There was no safety problem with changing the color of the
 9 lake. We would all be the poorer, I think --
 10 QUESTION: But that question was not resolved on
 11 appeal.
 12 MR. BERGER: That's correct, the court of
 13 appeals did not deal with that question, only the district
 14 court did, and its analysis is there for you to look at.
 15 The 1980 compact amendments that the two
 16 legislatures and Congress went through are interesting in
 17 this case, because while they, in fact, said there was a
 18 need for a moratorium, but the moratorium that the
 19 legislators and Congress agreed to was not the one that
 20 TRPA enacted here. They said, what we need is a cap on
 21 the number of building permits that are issued, and that's
 22 in the record here, too, and they said we're going to
 23 limit the number of building permits that each city and
 24 county can issue to the number that they issued in 1978.
 25 The first thing that TRPA did after that was

54 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 enacted was to say, we need to rearrange that, and we're
 2 going to say, you can issue those permits, but you can't
 3 issue any of them to these people. These people are
 4 totally frozen out, and they're being frozen out as part
 5 of a major public project so that we can clarify the
 6 waters in Lake Tahoe, and it just seems to us that where
 7 you have these people who are being asked to make this
 8 sacrifice on behalf of the greater public good, either of
 9 the people who already own homes around Lake Tahoe, and
 10 whose lands therefore gets more valuable, or on behalf of
 11 the rest of us who don't own homes up there but who might
 12 like to vacation there so that we can also enjoy the
 13 beauties of Lake Tahoe, that those people shouldn't be
 14 left flapping in the breeze with no compensation for the
 15 fact that they're the ones that have been asked to pay for
 16 this project.
 17 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Berger.
 18 The case is submitted.
 19 (Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the
 20 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
