In order to quarantine, do you have to provide treatment?"

    "speaker": "HART",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I don't find an answer to those questions precisely in this Court's jurisprudence. It does seem to me that one of the things this Court has said, however, on a due process level, is that a statute -- if the State is going to claim that it's committing an individual for treatment, that's what its statutory purpose is, then the statute ought to relate to that in terms of the nature of the confinement and the duration of the confinement."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

Assume our first case holds that a statute is civil, a facial attack on the statute as being criminal authorization for double jeopardy and ex post facto violation, and we reject that by saying the statute on its face is a civil statute. Does that mean that every application of that statute that might subsequently be challenged would have to come up with the same answer?  In other words, is it conceivable that a statute which is valid in response to a facial attack could nevertheless be invalid as applied in particular cases? does that mean, yes, the legislature wants a civil statute, not a criminal statute, but it is so punitive in effect as to be transformed from civil to criminal?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "HART",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I believe two things about that.  First, that Hudson stands for the proposition and reaffirms the notion that the effects test for whether a statute is civil or criminal is a facial test, and having given you that answer, I believe that what the effects test, or what that language means, is what are the necessary consequences of the very statutory provisions that whether it's Congress or State legislature has provided.  That would be the effects."

I'm not asking you to concede that that theory should prevail, but that is at least a possible assertion that could be made in a Federal court. really turns on is not even a broad proposition, or a broad set of rules about how we determine whether it's criminal or civil, but rather, your case depends on the proposition that it doesn't vary from individual to individual.

The other thing that I think answers, or helps answer that, Your Honor, is that Washington's law, just like Kansas' law, is a civil commitment statute, and once having enacted a civil commitment statute, there are certain consequences that fall from that for a State, and among them is to provide care more considerate than one would receive or is constitutionally entitled to receive in a penal institution."

In other words, the supreme court of Washington sent this back to the trial court on a less restrictive issue, less restrictive alternative.

My understanding, Your Honor, of this sort of mental disorder, this sort of paraphilia, is that it is a difficulty with volitional control, that you'll have situations where individuals will have these repeated urges and fantasies and then act on them, perhaps be remorseful, but they will repeat, and the ability to control them is something that the individual cannot do consistently."

We have argued that in the State court and lost, that that volitional control element is required, and as the amicus brief suggests, that remains potentially unclarified by the Hendrix opinion, but in Washington that testimony was sufficient. I think it's important to point out with regard to the testimony, to the decision in the superior court below in Mr. Young's case at the joint appendix, page 61, the trial court applied to Mr. Young a burden of proof unconstitutional, so that needs to be clarified, I suggest."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Now, you've heard the Attorney General say, and I guess what's important is that your client have some remedy, that he does have a remedy. That's what's important, and the remedy is that those conditions that made the Hendrix statute civil do not pertain to your client, then the law of Washington is violated, and therefore your client has an excellent remedy. Either the Hendrix majority conditions apply, or they do not.  If they do apply, you can't complain -- on my -- I was in dissent. But if they don't apply -- if they don't apply, Hendrix is not treated as a civilly committed person, and so we look at that and we decide it's not punitive. Justice Kennedy suggested that if, in fact, it turns out that treatment is a sham, then the decision would go the other way, and the dissent focused heavily on conditions and showed that treatment was not, in fact, there, so my suggestion is that this Court over and over and over again in a series of cases has looked at how a statute is implemented.  In the Allen v. Illinois case this Court said this would be a different case if somebody had claimed that there was punitive conditions. Most recently in Gardner v. Jones this Court, in evaluating an ex post facto claim, said, we're going to remand this case because there wasn't enough discovery done below about what's actually going on, and what the Court said is that the respondent must show that, as hand, that --"

Let's assume that criminality of the statute's character is not a shifting and springing quality. Does -- on the assumption that it's a civil statute, does your client have a remedy under State law, and I would add to it, does he have a remedy, even on the assumption of about with counsel for the State."

I would think the answer to Justice Souter's question, I mean, at least as I would see it, would be you have a civil statute, but this person is suffering there would be another, which would say that the Federal Constitution doesn't permit a person who is civilly committed to be there without any treatment, where he can sustain the treatment, et cetera, et cetera, and that would be the Federal constitutional claim. You might win, you might lose, but it seems to me you have those already in the lower courts, and we don't need a remand on this case to give you those. That's where I'm confused.  I mean, they're already pending, those two claims.  One's in the Washington system, the other's in the Federal system, and so what's this thing now going to help on?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BORUCHOWITZ",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, the posture of this case is somewhat unusual in that the Court has taken cert of this case before the evidentiary hearing in district court, and the Ninth Circuit said, send this back effect of this statute illuminates the punitive purpose, and that the effect itself is punitive. After Hendrix, and after the Ninth Circuit remanded the case the first time, then the focus of the court was on the punitive effect."

That's something we haven't reached yet, but I would think that would be the first question for the judge to decide.  What nature of evidence do I take?

First of all, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, Hendrix was decided affecting Hendrix alone the Washington statute, and that's not your function today, because what you're being asked to do is whether the court of appeals remand was correct or not. Now, along the way, you have to examine the question of how do we go about making that decision, and initially you look at the face of the statute, but that's not enough.  The civil label is not enough, you've said over and over again, and what you do then is, you look beyond that to the purpose and effect.

    "speech": "It seems to me that now that we're here the Court could do many different things.  The Court could simply say, we meant in Hendrix that the conditions were important.  We were all concerned about that, and the Ninth Circuit is right to consider the purpose and effect as shown by the conditions.  You could just do that. You could also say, by the way, mental abnormality, we really did mean what we said about lack of control, and that there should be some showing about, the person has no volitional control, and that would clear up a lot of things in the lower courts.  As we pointed out in our supplemental two-page brief, the State of Kansas just decided that yes, in fact, Hendrix just require the lack of volitional control. apply Hendrix.  There's nothing different from Hendrix in what the Ninth Circuit did.  We're simply going to send it down for the district court to evaluate it, and if the district court, Judge Cunero decided that let Judge Dwyer handle it because he's done the 1983 litigation, that could easily -- that's something the district court could do if it decided to do that. But obviously the 1983 litigation has not been a habeas situation involving the question of release because of unconstitutional punishment, and what this case is ultimately about is that a man has been punished for 10 years in a prison, longer than he served under his criminal sentence, without having committed another crime and without having a traditional mental disorder. And so there are many issues presented, and I think one of the things that's difficult about examining disability, and they were imposed in administrative proceedings. In Ward, the Court found that the penalty for oil discharge and water pollution was more analogous to traditional civil damages. In Shaw v. Martin, before the Court found that pretrial detention did not violate due process, the Court examined the actual conditions of confinement and cited testimony in the opinion about actual practices."

This is a situation where the State of Washington, over the time that the injunction has been in place, has made it harder to get less restrictive alternatives.  One of the things that this Court was concerned about in Hendrix, and specifically mentioned, was the less restrictive alternative idea, and what Washington has done in the last 5 years is to eliminate less restrictive alternative from the initial court determination and to make it harder for someone to get it. I would suggest that this Court over and over, in a number of cases involving both double jeopardy and due process and ex post facto has been to look at the statute as applied. In Foosha, Justice Thomas dissented saying that where is the proof?  In answer to Justice Scalia's question, does it just mean what naturally flows from the language, or does it mean the actual implementation?

But I think the answer to the question would be yes, because it has had a punitive purpose and effect from the beginning, but I don't think there's anything that's in conflict with Hendrix for us to go forward.  What Hendrix said was, nobody here's saying it's punitive,  it applies to Hendrix alone, it would be different if, and that's what the Court has said in many different circumstances, including Allen v. Illinois.  The case would be a different case if someone had shown that there was a punitive effect. So over and over again I think the Court has looked at the actual implementation of the statute, but you're right, I think from the very beginning he's been here that it's simply the administrative agency running amok.  This is certainly an act of the State that binds the State. The State -- thank you, Your Honor."

    "speech": "Thank you. I would like to point out to the Court again that this case is before the Court on a very narrow issue, and it is a threshold issue, and that is, how the Court determines whether a statute is civil or criminal.  Hudson establishes that that is done facially. Washington -- the issue about whether Washington's statute is civil or criminal is not before violent acts if he is not detained.  That is not before this Court.  The Washington supreme court and the Ninth Circuit have both ruled against Mr. Young on those issues, and there was no cross-petition here. The only issue before this Court, and what Mr. Young is contending, is that because he alleges that he is not receiving treatment consistent with a civil statute, that he ought to be released, and the only way Mr. Young can contend that is by saying, if I do not receive the treatment that I'm entitled to under a civil statute, somehow that converts this statute to a criminal statute, that one day your statute can be civil, the next day it can be criminal. In Mr. Young's view, if Washington had two commitment centers instead of one, the law would be civil at the center where the commitment -- where the treatment Washington's statute. Washington's statute is a civil law, and that is meaningful.  It means that people confined pursuant to that law are entitled to the treatment that civil committees are given under the statute and under the Constitution, and the proportionate, measured, wholly adequate remedy is to go to court and require the State of Washington to provide the treatment and the care that it has promised."
