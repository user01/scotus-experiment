4 next in Case 151808, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v.

5 Valle.

6             Mr. Landau.

7            ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU

8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9             MR. LANDAU:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10 and may it please the Court:

11             This case turns on the straightforward point

12 that the people of Puerto Rico are the source of

13 authority for the laws of Puerto Rico.  That means that

14 a prior Federal conviction has no Double Jeopardy

15 implications for the enforcement of the Commonwealth's

16 criminal laws because Commonwealth law and Federal law

17 emanate from different sources of authority:  The people

18 of Puerto Rico on the one hand and Congress on the

19 other.

20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Landau, could

21 Congress amend 48 U.S.C. 1704, which covers Guam, the

22 Virgin Islands, American Samoa?  Could it amend that

23 statute and put Puerto Rico in there as well?

24             MR. LANDAU:  It could certainly amend that

25 statute, Your Honor, with respect to Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 prosecutions in Puerto Rico pursuant to its authority

4

2 over Federal prosecutors.

3             Your question, Your Honor, raises a very

4 intricate question with  with 

5             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In  in the statute

6 is  it works both ways.

7             MR. LANDAU:  In the statute, Your Honor, it

8 does because there's no question Puerto Rico is in a

9 unique status different than Guam, the Virgin Islands,

10 and American Samoa precisely because those are all

11 territories governed, as traditionally, by organic acts

12 of Congress.

13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But is there  is

14 there 

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What  what about the

16 Northern Marianas?

17             MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor, they are in an

18 interesting position that is generally more analogous to

19 Puerto Rico in the sense that they are a Commonwealth of

20 the Northern Marianas with a compact of their own that

21 was very much modeled on Puerto Rico, although it's

22 somewhat different than the Puerto Rico model.  But

23 there's a profound distinction that goes to the heart of

24 this case between the home rule territories, were

25 Congress, to be sure, has delegated a measure of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 selfgovernment to those particular territories, but

5

2 each of them, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American

3 Samoa are still governed by organic acts of Congress, as

4 was Puerto Rico prior to 1952.

5             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Landau, could you

6 finish your answer to my question?  You said yes, as far

7 as what the federal Congress can deal with, what the

8 federal prosecutors do, but the statute works both ways.

9             Are you saying it couldn't  Congress has

10 no power to do that with respect to Puerto Rico?

11             MR. LANDAU:  I would say, Your Honor, that

12 that raises a very interesting and tricky issue with

13 respect to the compact that the 1950 Public Law 600

14 offered the people of Puerto Rico that was accepted.  As

15 this Court said in the Flores de Otero case in the

16 1970s 

17             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You're saying it's a hard

18 question, but you haven't given me 

19             MR. LANDAU:  Well, I  I  I think the

20 answer is probably not, insofar as this Court said 

21 and I'm not saying this myself.  I'm quoting this Court.

22 Congress relinquished control over the organization of

23 the internal affairs of the Island.

24             Now, one point to make very, very clear:

25 Our position today on the double jeopardy issue does not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 turn on that relinquishing issue.  But to answer your

6

2 hypothetical specifically, if Congress started to tell

3 the Puerto Rico prosecutors what cases they may

4 prosecute, that might raise some serious questions

5 under 

6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Just take the statute as

7 it is.  Just add Puerto Rico 

8             MR. LANDAU:  Right 

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   not telling

10 prosecutors what to do in a particular case.

11             MR. LANDAU:  Well, and  and, again, Your

12 Honor, I think the critical point here, and I think what

13 is most telling going back to some of the colloquy that

14 just happened in the other case, Congress since 1952 has

15 never attempted to do anything like that, to tell the

16 people  to exercise control over what the government

17 officials in Puerto Rico 

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That doesn't mean it

19 couldn't.  That doesn't mean it couldn't change the law.

20             Is it essential to your case that we

21 recognize Puerto Rico as a sovereign?

22             MR. LANDAU: It is not essential that you

23 recognize Puerto Rico as a sovereign with a capital "S,"

24 because if you get 12 political 

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's our usual double

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 jeopardy law, isn't it?

7

2             MR. LANDAU:  It  it is 

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:   two sovereigns, it's a

4 different matter.

5             MR. LANDAU:  It is the shorthand that this

6 Court has typically used, the dual sovereignty doctrine.

7 But the court made clear this is the lesson of the

8 Wheeler case where the court was  the Ninth Circuit

9 said, gee, these Indian tribes don't look like

10 sovereigns to us, because they are subject to the

11 plenary control of Congress.  That's not what we

12 typically think of as sovereigns.

13             And this Court says you're missing the

14 point, Ninth Circuit.  What we mean in the context of

15 double jeopardy, the language we are construing is the

16 same offense.  Laws  offences created by two different

17 entities are not the same offense if they flow from

18 different sources of court.

19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I don't understand how

20 that helps you, Mr. Landau.  You're saying that the test

21 is what the source of authority is, and you're saying

22 that the source of authority here is the Puerto Rican

23 people.

24             MR. LANDAU:  Correct.

25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that seems to be just 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
8 1 you're not taking another step back.  What's the source 2 of authority of Puerto Rican people?  The source of 3 authority of Puerto Rican people was a Congressional 4 act.  If you go back, the ultimate source of authority 5 is Congress. 6             MR. LANDAU:  That, Your Honor, is the crux 7 of the case.  And with all respect, I disagree with the 8 suggestion that the ultimate source here is Congress. 9 Congress could be  what Your Honor just described is 10 very much like a home rule jurisdiction, where, let's 11 say, you have the Virgin Islands legislature that passes 12 a Virgin Islands law.  But that government of the Virgin 13 Islands is itself a creature of Congress, as was the 14 government of the Philippines in the early 1900s, and 15 Puerto Rico in '30s at the time of the Shell case. 16             What made all the difference in the world, 17 Your Honor, was in 1950 to '52 Congress said, we 18 recognize and fully endorse the government  the 19 concept of government by consent.  So we are not 20 delegating authority to   21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but Congress today, if 22 it felt like it  and of course it won't.  But if it 23 felt like it, could Congress go back on that decision? 24             MR. LANDAU:  Well, this then goes to the 25 relinquishment issue, Your Honor, in terms of what is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 the nature of the compact.  This has been a very

9

2 emotional and hotbutton issue in Puerto Rico.  As Chief

3 Judge McGruder noted in his article in 1953 already,

4 there were divergent views at the time from the very

5 outset on whether 

6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, suppose we assume

7 that Congress could rescind the existing compact.

8             MR. LANDAU:  Right.

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you then lose your

10 case?

11             MR. LANDAU:  Absolutely not, Your Honor. And

12 that is 

13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why?

14             MR. LANDAU:  Because this is, again, the

15 lesson of Wheeler.  It was uncontested in Wheeler that

16 plenary congressional control over the Indians  over

17 the Indian tribes meant that Congress could abrogate

18 Indian sovereign immunity with the stroke of a pen, and

19 even abrogate the tribes and derecognize the tribes.

20 But that didn't mean that the existing tribal laws at

21 the time were not considered the laws of the separate

22 tribes 

23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are there  you know,

24 "sovereignty" is a slippery word.  That's why the

25 framers didn't use it in the constitution.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
10 1             Are you suggesting there's kind of a second 2 class sovereignty and a first class sovereignty? 3             MR. LANDAU:  Well, Your Honor, I  I 4 couldn't agree more with your insight, that 5 "sovereignty" is a slippery word.  If you got 12 6 political philosophers, they would all give you a 7 different answer as to what "sovereignty" means.  And I 8 think that is precisely why Wheeler said we can't have 9 judges and courts trying to decide double jeopardy 10 questions by asking abstract questions of sovereignty, 11 because, you know, even the State sovereignty is 12 different than the sovereignty of the independent 13 nations.  They don't have ambassadors, et cetera.  So 14 what this Court has made clear is that the test in the 15 double jeopardy context is all about the source of 16 authority for the laws. 17             And going back to Justice Kagan's question, 18 which I think cuts to the heart of the case, in this 19 particular case Congress said, we  and this is 20 pursuant to demands for  by the people of Puerto Rico 21 for government by consent.  The people of Puerto Rico 22 said, we are tired of being a colony.  We want to create 23 our own government.  And so the Constitution of Puerto 24 Rico could not be more explicit on this score, that it 25 says, "The political power of the Commonwealth emanates
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
11 1 from the people."  That document was submitted to the 2 Puerto Rico voters.  So you're a Puerto Rico voter and 3 you say this is what I'm voting for.  It was submitted 4 to the President of the United States and Congress, who 5 approved that particular  6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Landau, we have a 7 situation as a result of the decision of the Supreme 8 Court of Puerto Rico.  I think it was two of the 9 justices who said we're not going to get into this 10 business about the Constitution.  We think, interpreting 11 our own double jeopardy provision, somebody should not 12 be tried a second time.  So that's going to be the law 13 of Puerto Rico.  That's  if the Puerto Rico Supreme 14 Court said that, then we would have the situation that 15 has led us to grant cert in this case.  That is, if you 16 have a prosecution first in the Federal government, then 17 Puerto Rico will not have a second prosecution.  You 18 have it first in Puerto Rico.  The Federal government is 19 free to institute a second prosecution. 20             MR. LANDAU:  You're absolutely  you're 21 absolutely right, Your Honor.  And that was the position 22 of two of the nine justices on the Supreme Court of 23 Puerto Rico.  That position did not command a majority, 24 which is why there's no adequate and independent State 25 ground here.  The majority was very explicit 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And they could.  They

12

2 could.  If  if the  if we told the majority you're

3 wrong, nothing would prevent them from agreeing with

4 those two justices, right?

5             MR. LANDAU:  No, that's absolutely right.

6 And  and about 21 

7             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then there's no way you

8 could break that situation of having  it depends on

9 which  which jurisdiction goes first.

10             MR. LANDAU:  That's correct, Your Honor.

11 And that  that is true in about 21 states, that as a

12 matter of State law, either statutory or constitutional,

13 do not allow a subsequent prosecution.

14             But again, that doesn't change the point.

15 What  what made a cert grant appropriate and

16 intolerable was that the Federal  was the difference

17 between the Federal and State courts in Puerto Rico on

18 the federal constitutional question.  It was not if one

19 were Federal and one were State.

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Landau, there's

21 something you said that resonates with me, 'cause I've

22 been trying to find a definition of "sovereignty."  And

23 one has been created in the briefing by saying that

24 states are sovereign; yet if you look at international

25 usage, they wouldn't consider states necessarily

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 sovereign because they can't order their foreign

13

2 affairs.  They can't print money.  They can't do lots of

3 things that others would consider them sovereign for.

4             So I guess the Constitution does something

5 else with that word.  What is it  what are the

6 elements of sovereignty with respect to the Double

7 Jeopardy Clause that you think are commanded by our case

8 law?  There  there's more than just the Puerto Rican

9 people say.

10             MR. LANDAU:  Absolutely.

11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And it can't be that

12 it's the compact alone.  So what is it?  What are the

13 principles 

14             MR. LANDAU:  Absolutely.

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   that you meet that

16 would create sovereignty in the Double Jeopardy sense?

17             MR. LANDAU:  To  to take your  your

18 question in turn, Your Honor, this Court has made it

19 clear in a series of cases starting in Wheeler in 1978

20 that really tries to synthesize what the Court has been

21 saying with respect to the dual sovereignty doctrine

22 over a century.

23             And what the Court said is, in the Double

24 Jeopardy context, we are trying to decide whether two

25 offenses from different entities are the same offense.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
14 1 That has traditionally been called "dual sovereignty." 2             But what we mean by "dual sovereignty" in 3 this context doesn't require this broader  let's 4 say  I'll call it "sovereignty with a capital S" 5 inquiry.  It is a much more targeted and narrow inquiry 6 into  is the  the source of authority for each 7 offense. 8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, I'm looking at 9 Lanza, and it says  I think Lanza says, and it's a 10 Double Jeopardy  11             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right. 12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   Clause, that for 13 Double Jeopardy Clause purposes, sovereignty means, one, 14 that the separate entity possesses the authority to 15 determine what shall be an  an offense against their 16 peace and dignity; two, can enact laws without the 17 interference of the other; and, three, draws authorities 18 to punish the offender  and this is the one that 19 you've been arguing  from a distinct source of power 20 from the other sovereign. 21             MR. LANDAU:  Right. 22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And  and you keep 23 saying it's the Constitution.  It's the "We the People." 24 It sounds a  a bit histrionic to me.  It  there's 25 something else.  What is meant 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
15 1             MR. LANDAU:  It is, Your Honor.  And I  2 and I  3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   by this distinct 4 source of power? 5             MR. LANDAU:  If  if could just say  make 6 two quick points in response to that. 7             First, Lanza is not the last word on this 8 because Wheeler, in the '70s, clarified what Lanza meant 9 because, for instance, the Ninth Circuit in Wheeler 10 said, well, the Indian Tribes don't fit the Lanza 11 definition because Congress has plenary authority to 12 overrule at any time.  So that goes to the first part of 13 your question. 14             To the second part of your question, it is 15 Congress acting in tandem with the people of Puerto Rico 16 that's critical.  In other words, it is certainly not 17 the people of Puerto Rico that could unilaterally and 18 without reference to Congress just say, guess what?  We 19 are the source of authority of our own laws.  And  and 20 that would be the end of the story. 21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Landau, I thought 22 that, in the  in the case of the Indian Tribes, 23 what  what the Court said is they were once sovereign 24 before we got here and we took some of that sovereignty 25 away.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1             That's not the case with Puerto Rico.

16

2             MR. LANDAU:  Yes.  We are certainly not

3 saying that we are absolutely on all fours with the

4 Indian Tribes.  There are  what Your Honor said is

5 true.  Although one thing to keep in mind, of course, is

6 that not all tribes proceeded the  the  the creation

7 of the United States.  In fact, if Congress can

8 recognize Indian Tribes to this day, the standard is

9 under 25 C.F.R. 83.7.  And an entity that existed as

10 recently at 1900 can still be considered an Indian

11 tribe.  So 

12             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the rationale was

13 that the tribes had this sovereignty, and that's what

14 was being respected.

15             MR. LANDAU:  That  that  that is

16 correct, Your Honor.  The  the  the tribes had an

17 inherent sovereignty.  But I think the point for Double

18 Jeopardy purposes doesn't require the inherency.  It

19 just requires a  a recognition by Congress of an

20 exercise of sovereignty.  And that goes, I think 

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what is it?  That is,

22 look.  If we simply write an opinion and it says, Puerto

23 Rico is sovereign, that has enormous implications.

24             MR. LANDAU:  It does.

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  The insular cases are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 totally changed in their applications.

17

2             MR. LANDAU:  Right.

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  The political implications

4 I'll just stay away from.

5             On the other hand, if we write an opinion

6 that says it's just a territory, that has tremendous

7 implications.

8             MR. LANDAU:  Correct.

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  How did we tell the UN it

10 wasn't a colony?  Why are we not reporting on this

11 colony every year?

12             MR. LANDAU:  Correct.

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  So either way, between

14 those two, the implications in law and in politics and

15 everything else are overwhelming.

16             Therefore, you argue a third and middle

17 position.  Your position pointing to four cases in this

18 Court, so you have very good authority.  It's for Double

19 Jeopardy purposes.  There is a different question.  The

20 question is what are the sources of the law?  And then I

21 find four cases that say just what you said.  Okay?

22             Now, you say the sources of the law, the

23 sources of criminal law here are different.  Okay.  What

24 I think Justice Sotomayor wanted you to say is explain

25 that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1             MR. LANDAU:  Yes.

18

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  Take a little time, if you

3 like.  In what way are they different?

4             MR. LANDAU:  Absolutely, Your Honor.

5             They are different, Your Honor, because

6 Congress invited  in Public Law 600, Congress said, we

7 recognize the principle of government by consent.  That

8 is something that we, as Congress rightly 

9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Going back to the

10 political issues.  And  and  and that's what I think

11 Justice Breyer is trying to stay away from.

12             This is a very simple question.

13             MR. LANDAU:  Okay.

2 legislative powers of which were vested by the people of

3 Puerto Rico in the legislative assembly.  In other

4 words, the Puerto Rico Constitution could not be more

5 specific in saying "We, the people of Puerto Rico, in

6 exercise of our" 

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The laws were made by

8 Puerto Rico's comparable Congress.

9             MR. LANDAU:  That is correct, Your Honor.

10 And  and this is the  I think the point I'd really

11 like to underscore, because I think it's critical here,

12 is this arrangement was not something that Puerto Rico

13 did as a rogue usurpation of authority.  This was

14 pursuant to the invitation of Congress and with the

15 blessing of Congress.  That was submitted to the

16 Congress.  The Congress saw that language.

17             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Even in saying that,

18 Mr. Landau, you're putting Congress in the driver's seat

19 here:  It was done at the invitation of Congress.

20 Congress approved it.  Presumably Congress can unapprove

21 it if Congress ever wished to.

22             So if Congress is in the driver's seat, why

23 isn't Congress the source of authority for the purposes

24 of our Double Jeopardy jurisprudence 

25             MR. LANDAU:  Because

20 1             JUSTICE KAGAN:   which seems to make that 2 the issue?  I mean, you can imagine a different Double 3 Jeopardy jurisprudence where the issue was who just 4 exercises authority in the real world?  But that seems 5 not to be what we ask. 6             MR. LANDAU:  That's  that's correct. 7 That's correct.  And I think that  that the key point 8 that I'd like to make, Your Honor, is that you have to 9 look at  Congress has plenary authority over the 10 territories under the Territorial Clause.  Our position 11 is that Congress is not the prisoner of its plenary 12 authority; it is the master of plenary authority. 13             And therefore, when Congress can decide 14 that, for the longterm future of Puerto Rico, it does 15 not think it is appropriate or good for  for Puerto 16 Rico or the United States to have direct or delegated 17 Federal power in Puerto Rico.  It says we accede to 18 the  the request of the Puerto Rican people to create 19 their own government and to be the source of authority 20 of their own law. 21             So that's what Congress invites.  The people 22 of Puerto Rico accept the invitation.  They enact a 23 Constitution that is entirely explicit saying the 24 political power of the Commonwealth creates the 25 structure, creates a legislative authority, vests the

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let  let's call this 

3 this theory of yours interim sovereignty.  Are there any

4 examples in international law of interim sovereignty?

5             Are there any examples in international law

6 or in the United States' experience of a dichotomy such

7 as you suggest?

8             MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor, again, I think 

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I  I  I just don't

10 know the answer to that.

11             MR. LANDAU:  I think that  that  that,

12 in a sense, the danger of that is that's already going

13 back to asking about concepts of sovereignty.  And I

14 think the more one asks those more abstract questions,

15 it gets away from what is a much simpler question, which

16 is  I think this goes back to Justice Sotomayor's

17 point, which is what is  we have before us here 

18 we  this is a specific case or controversy.

19             Nobody's asking the Court to make a broad

20 political statement.  All we want to know is may Puerto

21 Rico, may the Commonwealth prosecutors prosecute these

22 particular Puerto Rico Commonwealth gun charges or 

23 and ammunition charges?  Okay?

24             The  the source of authority for these

25 particular laws is the legislature of Puerto Rico, and

LANDAU:  That's what distinguishes this 5 from municipalities  I'm sorry. 6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why does  why does 7 the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have that authority? 8 Where did it come from? 9             MR. LANDAU:  The  Congress can recognize 10 and invite an exercise of sovereignty, just like this 11 Court recognized in Lara. 12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it had complete 13 authority under the Territorial Clause whether to do 14 that or not, right? 15             MR. LANDAU:  That's correct.  And that is 16 exactly  17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that would  18 I  it would seem to me, then, that the authority to do 19 it came from Congress when they passed the  20             MR.

Official  Subject to Final Review
23 1 Puerto Rico.  And  and what it did is the Constitution 2 that Puerto Rico adopted and that Congress then accepted 3 specifically says political power emanates from the 4 people.  So Your Honor, I think  5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why is  I mean, 6 you seem to fix on invited as somehow different than 7 authorized. 8             MR. LANDAU:  Well, even if you said  I 9 guess the point is authorized sounds like a delegation 10 of authority. 11             I think the point is Congress said, look, 12 you go adopt your own constitution.  That in and of 13 itself doesn't necessarily answer the question of where 14 the authority from that constitution comes from.  But 15 again, when it says fully recognizing the principal of 16 government by consent, this is what the people of 17 Puerto Rico wanted.  They wanted to  to create their 18 own government.  They didn't want to have another 19 Organic Act. 20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Aren't there territorial 21 legislatures? 22             MR. LANDAU:  There are indeed, Your Honor. 23 In  in  24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's the difference? 25             MR. LANDAU:  The difference is

And in fact, that 5 was the tradition in the 19th century.  We cited a 6 number of cases  of course there weren't a lot of 7 these kind of cases in the 19th century because the 8 Federal government had very, very limited criminal 9 power.  So these come up in things like counterfeiting 10 money and selling liquor to the Indians. 11             But  but so  so the  12             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I just ask you a 13 question about that?  I don't quite understand because 14 this  this whole issue is a result of a fivetofour 15 decision of this Court in the 1950s, right?  Bartkus. 16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Bartkus. 17             MR. LANDAU:  But yeah, I mean, certainly  18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So  so talking about 19 cases before that, there was just  there was no issue 20 before that. 21             MR. LANDAU:  Well, Your Honor, certainly 22 the  the principle of dual sovereignty had been 23 recognized by this Court as early as the 1840s; in other 24 words, that  that two offenses for Double Jeopardy 25 purposes were not the same if  if they were created by

LANDAU:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And 6 again  7             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And so I don't think it 8 was settled before then. 9             MR. LANDAU:  Well, but it  it was 10 something that  it has been an issue that had divided 11 people in the Court.  In the more recent cases since the 12 1950s, it has not been a particularly divisive issue. 13 And just to be clear in this case, there is no call by 14 the other side to overrule  15             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm questioning you 16 looking back before the Bartkus case, for precedent. 17             MR. LANDAU: Right.  But Bartkus didn't come 18 out of the blue, Your Honor.  Bartkus has antecedents. 19             Lanza was the first case in 1922 when 20 prohibition is what really suddenly had federal criminal 21 laws that were quite widespread throughout the country. 22 And Lanza is, I think, the first case you can 23 characterize as a square holding of this case on the 24 dual sovereignty doctrine. 25             It continued to be a somewhat controversial

1 doctrine up until the 1950s, and then it's been, I

26

2 think, settled since then.  And it's not been challenged

3 in this case.

4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Landau, I'm not sure

5 you answered my question about why territorial

6 legislatures are different.

7             MR. LANDAU:  They are different because

8 those  the other ones are Home Rule legislatures.  In

9 other words, there's a Virgin Islands Organic Act,

10 there's a Guam Organic Act.  So Congress  and a D.C.

11 Home Rule Act.

12             Congress created that government structure

13 and endowed it with authority.  Pursuant to what

14 Congress did, the people have a certain degree of

15 autonomy.  They elect their legislators.  D.C. has D.C.

16 laws.  The Virgin Islands has Virgin Islands law.  You

17 know, to some extent or other those can be vetoed,

18 maybe, by Congress.

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you say that the issue

20 is the source of the law in question, it seems to me

21 that the territorial legislature is as much the source

22 of a law as is the legislature of Puerto Rico.

23             MR. LANDAU:  The question, Your Honor, is

24 the ultimate source of authority for the law.  So when

25 you have a Home Rule jurisdiction  again, this is 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
27 1 I'm not saying that this is what this Court has held, 2 that when you have a Home Rule jurisdiction  this is 3 the Waller case, for instance, where it's a 4 municipality, was clearly  the city council was the 5 source of the law.  But the ultimate source of the law 6 was delegated power from the State. 7             The critical point here is that the 8 Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the legislative assembly of 9 Puerto Rico  this goes back to Justice Sotomayor's 10 point and Justice Kagan's point  is not exercising 11 power delegated by Congress  12             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I see your  I see your 13 time is getting up.  It seemed to me that in a way, if 14 you answered Justice Scalia's question, well, yes, it 15 is  it is true that local legislature is the source of 16 the law, and there is Double Jeopardy there too.  Yes. 17             MR. LANDAU:  Well, you  again, that would 18 be another way of looking at the  at the issue.  And 19 that, frankly, was the historical way of looking at it. 20 If you go back to the 1850s cases, they said 21 territories, which at that time were creatures of 22 Congress, that was considered to be a separate sovereign 23 for Double Jeopardy.  That's the historical antecedent. 24 But in the 20th century, particularly in Wheeler and the 25 more recent cases, the Court has said the question is

1 the ultimate source of authority.

28

2             The ultimate source of authority for the

3 laws of Puerto Rico, unlike the ultimate source of

4 authority for the laws of the Virgin Islands, is the

5 people of Puerto Rico, not Congress.

9            ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM G. UNIKOWSKY

10               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

11             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may

12 it please the Court:

13             Under our Constitution, States are sovereign

14 and territories are not.

15             Although Puerto Rico has indisputedly

16 achieved a historic degree of autonomy, it remains a

17 territory under Article IV.  As such, it cannot be

18 considered sovereign for Double Jeopardy purposes.

19             An unbroken line of this Court's Double

20 Jeopardy cases has stated, both before and after the

21 enactment of the 1952 constitution of Puerto Rico, that

22 territories are not sovereign for Double Jeopardy

23 purposes.

24             JUSTICE KAGAN:  It does seem, Mr. Unikowsky,

25 as if Congress has given Puerto Rico as much authority

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 as it possibly could have short of making it a State

29

2 itself.  Do you disagree with that?

3             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, two responses.  One,

4 yes, I disagree with that.  And two, even if I agreed

5 with that, we do think that there is a sharp dividing

6 line between States and territories for constitutional

7 purposes.

8             JUSTICE BREYER:  What kind of territory is

9 it?

10             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  It is a  we think there's

11 only one type of territory 

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  There is.  The  the

13 insular cases have at least two.

14             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, yes.  The insular

15 cases that hold that it is considered an unincorporated

16 territory.  That is true.

17             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So it's that kind.

22 a case that just construed a Federal statute to hold

UNIKOWSKY:  That is correct, Your Honor. 17             JUSTICE BREYER:  Where does it say that in 18 any of our cases? 19             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, I think the Yankton 20 case very clearly says that if a portion of land is not 21 in a State, then it has to be under a territory. 22             JUSTICE BREYER:  And what are the Indians? 23             MR.

31 1             JUSTICE BREYER:  Because  because we do 2 not recognize explicitly in the Constitution 3 "Commonwealth," therefore there is no Commonwealth?  Is 4 that what you want us to say? 5             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I want you to say that this 6 Court has already held in the Harris case that 7 Puerto Rico is a territory.  And not only that, that  8             JUSTICE BREYER:  With some purposes.  But 9 the  the issue here, as I see it  which maybe will 10 take a second  is there are four cases that say we 11 don't have to reach these grand questions.  All we have 12 to do is decide what the source of power is. 13             Now their argument is that even if you go 14 back to the Foraker Act, which indeed did have the 15 people of Puerto Rico making laws, and if you then add 16 the Resolution 600 which delegated the authority to make 17 the Constitution, the Constitution itself which speaks 18 of "We the People" of Puerto Rico making a law, the fact 19 that later Congress and the President said Puerto Rico 20 has a Republican form of government, the fact that 21 subsequent to that we went to the United Nations and had 22 them withdraw the requirement to report on a colony 23 because Puerto Rico is not a colony   and you know 24 the words as well as I, and they sure sound like 25 "sovereign."

4 Commonwealth too  are to be interpreted in light of

5 the civil code tradition of Europe, which was the

6 tradition that applied prior to 1900, and not the common

7 law.

8             I don't see, when you put all those things

9 together, if you're looking at the facts of what the law

10 of Puerto Rico is in the area, it sounds to me like it's

11 civil code coming out of a constitution which I grant

12 you was given by authority of Congress.  So there we

13 are.

14             Now five things they've listed there that

15 make it different, not only from anything you can think

16 of but from anything I can think of.  So why don't you

17 reply to those five things, if you want.

19 things established

21             (Laughter.)

22             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I think those features of

23 Puerto Rico and others established that Puerto Rico has

24 undoubtedly achieved a significant degree of autonomy,

25 but those characteristics are not the characteristics

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 that matter for sovereignty purposes or for Double

33

2 Jeopardy purposes.  The question is the ultimate source

3 of power, and here the ultimate source of power is

4 Congress, which delegated the authority to enact the

5 Puerto Rican Constitution.

6                      And I'd also point out that if one

7 looks at the characteristics of sovereignty as defined

8 in the Constitution and this Court's cases, Puerto Rico

9 doesn't have them.

10        For instance, in the Alden cases, this Court

11 explained one of the reasons we call States sovereign is

12 that one cannot frame their generally  general police

13 power as the delegation of Federal power because the

14 Federal government doesn't have a general police power

15 in the States, so there's nothing to delegate.  That's

16 just not true in Puerto Rico where 

17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that was not true of

18 many of the territories that were admitted as States.

19 They came in to Statehood and were conferred by a  the

20 sovereignty was conferred by a  agreement with the

21 Federal government.  And States were admitted by

22 agreement, and sovereignty were confirmed on them by

25 say one of the islands in the Caribbean.  I'll make one

2             Atlantis has been  never kicked out its

3 foreign colonial status 200 years ago, but it really

4 doesn't have many resources.  And it comes to the

5 United States and it says, I want a treaty.  You'll take

6 care of all of our external affairs.  We'll follow

7 whatever you say with respect to external affairs.

8 We're even going to use the American dollar 'cause it's

9 convenient, but you can't touch our internal affairs.

10 And Congress approves that treaty.  Would that, for

11 Double Jeopardy purposes, not be a sovereign?

12             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I think it wouldn't be a

13 sovereign if that was not part of the United States, not

16 wouldn't?

17             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  It wouldn't.  So for

18 instance, we can see that Micronesia and Palau, which

19 are not independent countries, I believe in the

20 United Nations, are  are genuinely sovereign, even

21 though there are defense agreements with the

22 United States because the United States has foreign

23 allies with whom they have many treaties and

24 relationships, and those foreign allies may be

25 sovereign, but those aren't territories.  They're not

3             That's the distinction in Puerto Rico, which

4 is, indisputably, a territory 

5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But if Congress has that

6 treaty power, why does it have similar power under its

7 Rule and Regulation Clause of the Constitution?  There's

8 no limiting principle of what rules and regulations

9 Congress can make.

10             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, let me refer, Your

11 Honor, both to 

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Under that 

13             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I apologize.

14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR   under that

15 constitutional clause, there's no suggestion of how or

16 even what kinds of treaties  perhaps not in violation

17 of the Constitution, but what kind of treaties Congress

18 can make.  And it makes an awful large number of them.

19             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  It does, Your Honor.  But

20 let me refer to both the constitutional text and

21 structure as the basis of our argument.  Beginning with

22 the text, Article IV characterizes territories as,

23 quote, "belonging to the United States."  And we believe

24 that is antithetical to the concept of sovereignty.

25             Congress has the ultimate power to enact a

1 wide variety of the governmental forms in the

2 territories, but the sine qua non of a territory is

3 that, in fact, Congress does possess that power.

4             And I'd also refer to the constitutional

5 structure.  The framers of our Constitution split the

6 atom of sovereignty between the Federal government and

7 the States.  And I think that presupposes that the

8 question of what types of sovereigns would exist in the

9 United States is a question of constitutional 

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  The Indians.  What about

11 the Indians?

12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Unikowsky, it sure seems

13 as though in the early 1950s, Congress with respect to

14 Puerto Rico, said we want to give it some sovereign

15 authority.  We want to give it an enormous amount of

16 Home Rule authority, basically everything, and we also

17 have some idea in our heads that Puerto Rico ought to be

18 a sovereign with all the things sovereigns have like a

19 Constitution and a "We the People" clause.

20             And  and why isn't that something 

21 it's  it's an unusual idea, to be sure, a  a

22 sovereign territory.  But Congress seems to have wanted

23 to do exactly that.

24             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, I'd first push back on

25 your premise.  I don't think that's what Congress wanted

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 to do.  I think that the history, the legislative

37

2 history, and the  the events, the historical record,

3 show that Congress wanted to delegate autonomy, which is

4 different from creating a sovereign.

5             So first I'd  I'd turn to the issue of

6 Section 20 in which Congress just unceremoniously

7 stripped a portion of the Puerto Rican Constitution and

8 permanently barred Puerto Ricans from enacting 

9 reenacting it.  That is not consistent with what I think

10 we ordinarily consider a sovereign.

11             And I'd also point to the legislative

12 history and record.  I mean, there's testimony from the

13 Secretary of the Interior, from The Resident

14 Commissioner of Puerto Rico, from the Governor of

15 Puerto Rico, in the House report, in the Senate report.

16 All of that seemed to contemplate that the political

17 status of Puerto Rico wouldn't change and this was just

18 a delegation.

19             I mean, there was actually a hearing we

20 quote on page 30 of our brief where the chairman of the

21 relevant Senate committee basically tells everybody

22 that, in fact, Congress's powers over Puerto Rico

23 wouldn't be altered at all; that ultimately this was a

24 delegation of power that one  that was revoked and

25 wouldn't change Congress's ultimate power over

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 Puerto Rico.

38

2             So I actually think it's Petitioner's

3 position that really is fundamentally inconsistent with

4 the historical record as it existed at the time.

5             We don't dispute that there's  this is

6 historic legislation.  I mean, it's true.  Petitioner's

7 brief characterizes the 1950 to '52 legislation as,

8 quote, "path marking."  And we actually agree with that,

9 it was path marking.  It was historic legislation that

10 delegated a significant amount of power to the people of

11 Puerto Rico, and it was very historically important, and

12 remains important today.

13             But there is a difference, a meaningful

14 constitutional difference between the delegation of

15 power and the conferral of sovereignty.  The former

16 occurred in Puerto Rico, as it has occurred in other

17 territories.  The latter can only apply to States within

18 our union.

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And is  is our argument

20 so abstract that it doesn't acknowledge real

21 practicalities of multiple prosecutions?  Of  of

22 course Mr. Landau couldn't come up and say, please

23 forget Heath and Wheeler and Walter and Grafton.  Let's

24 do something other than sovereignty.

25             Has there been any suggestion by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 commentators and so forth that this whole inquiry of

39

2 sovereignty and source of power is a little bit

3 misplaced?

4             Of course, you have the problem with the

5 cities within its  within separate  within one

6 State, which is, it seems, ought to be subject to a

7 single rule.  But have there been any commentaries that

8 lead us to another approach altogether?  I don't think

9 we're going to overrule four cases, but 

10             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I will acknowledge that

11 there has been some larger articles suggesting that this

12 whole line of cases is wrong and the Court should look

13 to something else, to autonomy.  But certainly this

14 Court's cases, going back a century, haven't followed

15 that approach at all.

16             And I actually think the municipality

17 example is a very good one for us because cities

18 regularly enact Home Rule charters through a very

19 similar type of Democratic process that Petitioner

20 describes for Puerto Rico.

21             The fundamental principle of Petitioner's

22 position here is that the enactment of a  of a charter

23 of local selfgovernment setting forth the parameters

24 for local selfgovernment in and of itself leads to

25 sovereignty.  That's how they distinguish the Shell

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
40 1 case.  But if that's true, the  there's no limiting 2 principal because municipalities do that all the time. 3             I didn't fully understand  4             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Unikowsky, you  you 5 said before that Congress didn't mean to confer 6 sovereignty here.  Do you think Congress could do that? 7             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  No, Your Honor, it could 8 not.  We think that the Constitution prohibits that, and 9 Congress's exercise of its powers was fully consistent 10 with that constitutional requirement. 11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  You  12 you're saying to me that Congress can't make Puerto Rico 13 independent? 14             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Of course it could, Your 15 Honor. 16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if it can do that, 17 why can't it have other arrangements with Puerto Rico 18 the way it has with everybody else?  Why are we saying 19 that with respect to territories they don't have that 20 power? 21             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Your Honor, I think if 22 Congress  if Puerto Rico is to remain a territory, 23 which it is under Article IV, as this Court has held, 24 then Congress must retain the ultimate power.  I think 25 that follows from the constitutional structure in which

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  UN said that Puerto Rico

7 has been invested with the attributes of political

9 selfgovernment attained by the Puerto Rican people.

There are about ten words such as 6 "republic," "not a colony," "attributes of political 7 sovereignty," repeated in five or six key documents. 8             I do  not everyone does  happen to think 9 that what we tell the UN to get it removed from the 10 colony status bears some consideration.  I grant you not 11 everyone agrees with that, but that's my view of it. 12             Laughter. 13             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  And I guess 14 I  all right.  Forget it. 15             (Laughter.) 16             MR.

I just think that having the attributes 21 of political sovereignty, and being a republic, and 22 saying that the Constitution of Puerto Rico is the basic 23 document, whatever the language was there, don't sound 24 like a municipality. 25             MR. UNIKOWSKY: Your Honor, there are
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
43 1 differences between a municipality and Puerto Rico, such 2 as Puerto Rico has a much more delegated power than the 3 typical municipality.  That is undoubtedly true. 4             But the  there's no  5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You think that doesn't 6 have meaning?  In most municipalities, their offenses 7 are treated as criminal offenses and not criminal 8 infractions.  They can only pass laws with respect to a 9 very limited amount of issues. 10             The States have control over many, many 11 other things.  They are substantially different.  Why 12 would we have bothered talking about the structure of 13 Florida's system with municipalities in Waller?  We went 14 through how the State controlled all of the  most of 15 the internal affairs of municipalities, and we said they 16 are not separate sovereigns because of this control. 17 All we could have said is what you want us to say now, 18 which is municipalities' ultimate source is the State 19 government. 20             But we did something very different in that 21 case. 22             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Your Honor, may I answer? 23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Briefly. 24             MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yes, Your Honor. 25             I think that, already as of Shell, Puerto
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 Rico enjoyed that broad police power.  That's why

44

2 Petitioner's argument turns entirely on the existence of

3 the Constitution of Puerto Rico.  And our point is that

5 confer sovereignty.

8            ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY

9           FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

10                SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

11             MS. SAHARSKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

12 please the Court:

13             I think to respond to some of the questions

14 that have come up, I'd like to go back and address what

15 the Court has said this test is, for dual sovereignty in

16 the Double Jeopardy context, and why it's been using

17 that test.

18             And the test that the Court has consistently

19 used for the past 100 years is by looking to the

20 ultimate source of the authority, the laws for

21 prosecuting and the authority to prosecute.  And the

22 reason that the Court has said that it's looked to that

23 ultimate source is because the dual sovereignty doctrine

24 rests on the basic structure of our Federal system.

25 That's what the Court said in Wheeler.  And the Court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
45 1 has been very careful to guard who is a sovereign under 2 the Constitution and who is not, because, after all, 3 we're talking about a weighty power here, which is the 4 ability of two sovereigns to prosecute a person for an 5 offense with the same elements. 6             So if you trace the history of what this 7 Court has done, it started with Lanza and Grafton. 8 Lanza was a case about the Federal government as opposed 9 to the States.  And the Court said should they have this 10 power to dual prosecute?  Well, we look to the 11 Constitution, and the unique structure that was put in 12 place:  The splitting the atom of sovereignty.  And we 13 are in a circumstance where both the States and the 14 Federal government have this sovereign power.  They 15 should both be able to prosecute. 16             But then the case  the Court turned to 17 cases about the territories, which was the Shell case 18 about Puerto Rico, but then also the Grafton case about 19 the Philippines, and it said, no, the territories derive 20 their ultimate power from Congress.  That's true by 21 virtue of the Territory Clause. 22             Now, one thing that the Court has considered 23 in the course of those cases as they've evolved, I 24 think, is the suggestion that Justice Kennedy made, 25 which is maybe we should focus on something else like
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
46 1 autonomy and the ability to prosecute, and what it looks 2 like practically, or on the ground. 3             And the Court has consistently rejected a 4 test along those lines, and I think that we have three 5 data points for that. 6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  They haven't 7 issued that. 8             In all of those cases, Grafton and all of 9 the ones pre1952, the Court pointed to the fact that, 10 when these islands pass laws, they could be vetoed by 11 Congress or  or were  that was the Organic Act. 12             In all of these places, Congress was 13 appointing their legislature, in part, or they were 14 appointing colonial governors.  And we went through, in 15 each one of them, very carefully, what the issues of 16 control that remained, that didn't make them sovereign 17 in any way, that made them classic territories. 18             So it's not that we didn't  we eschewed 19 looking at that. 20             MS. SAHARSKY:  I don't think that's right. 21 And I'd like to just look at the specific example of 22 Puerto Rico that the Court considered in the Shell case. 23             As you say, by that point, Puerto Rico  or 24 as you suggested, there had already been significant 25 selfgovernment in Puerto Rico.  There were two houses
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
47 1 of the legislature elected.  And the Court, when asking 2 this question about whether there could be both Puerto 3 Rico antitrust defenses and Federal antitrust defenses, 4 went through the situation in Puerto Rico and said there 5 is significant selfgovernment in here now.  It defined 6 Puerto Rico as having an autonomy similar to that of the 7 States  that's in 1937  and said that Congress had 8 given it a sweeping grant of legislative authority. 9             But the Court nonetheless said that under 10 our constitutional system, as a territory of the United 11 States subject to Congress's authority, that Puerto Rico 12 was not a separate sovereign. 13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you forget that 14 Congress could veto those laws. 15             MR. SAHARSKY:  It  16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Before 1952, Congress 17 could veto Puerto Rico's laws.  It has relinquished that 18 right. 19             MR. SAHARSKY:  I don't think that that's 20 right.  I don't think that that's right, and to the 21 extent the Petitioner suggests it, it's just not 22 consistent with the Territory Clause of the 23 Constitution, which, after all  24             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, now, this is  25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   gives plenary power to

1 Congress.

Official  Subject to Final Review

48

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  This is  it's very

3 interesting what you're saying.

4             Remember, though, one of the provisions of

5 the Puerto Rico Constitution, which Congress approved

6 and said it was a Republican form of government, is that

7 criminal actions shall be conducted in the name and by

8 the authority of the people of Puerto Rico.

9             Now, that sounds like a delegation of

10 authority as to source, to go back to the Spanish system

11 if they want.

12             Now, if I take your view, then I guess you

13 have to say  and it has considerable implication 

14 that that doesn't matter because Congress can take back

15 what they gave.

16             Now, is that the position of the government

17 or the executive branch?  Because that has tremendous

18 implication.

19             MR. SAHARSKY:  Right.

20             JUSTICE BREYER:  Because obviously, there is

21 an argument as to whether what Congress and the

22 President gave in Resolution 600, followed by the

23 Constitution, followed by what happened at the UN, under

24 the authority  and looking to Felix Frankfurter for

25 guidance, who said that the Constitution provides us

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
49 1 with many forms of possible relationship.  That's what 2 his view was. 3             And now, is the position of the executive 4 branch  I mean, you want to take a position on this? 5 That  that  that Congress, if it wishes, can take 6 all of that back and Puerto Rico has no more 7 independence than  in principle, than any of the other 8 places that were territories? 9             Now, that's  that's a big question.  But 10 do  do you  do you see it's an important question? 11             And I want to know if the government's 12 position rests upon it, because that's  that's an 13 important statement for the executive, in my opinion. 14             MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, two  two responses to 15 that question. 16             The first, I think, is the first part of 17 your question, this statement in the Puerto Rico 18 Constitution that the authority to prosecute comes from 19 the people of Puerto Rico and that it's in the name of 20 the people of Puerto Rico.  That's been true since 1900. 21 That was in the 1900 Organic Act; that was true in 1917. 22 Puerto Rico is not claiming that it was a sovereign 23 then.  So I  I would not rely on that. 24             But the second and, obviously, more weighty 25 question you raised is the question of could  could
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 Congress revise the arrangements it has with Puerto

50

2 Rico?  And we think the answer is yes, and that that

3 follows from the structure of the Constitution and its

4 history.

5             I want to explain why that's why, but first,

6 I think it's very important for us to say that

7 Congress's position towards Puerto Rico, starting in

8 1900 through 1917 with the elected legislature 

9 elected legislators; 1947, the elected governor; and

10 then this act in 1950, has been one of increasing

11 selfgovernment, recognizing the benefits of that to the

12 people of Puerto Rico.  That's why Congress authorized

13 the enactment of the Constitution.  We think that that's

14 a good thing.  We have no reason to believe that

15 Congress would revisit that.  And we think it's had many

16 benefits for the people of Puerto Rico and the United

17 States.

18             But asking the constitutional question,

19 which is what the Court has asked in its double jeopardy

20 cases, about whether Congress could revise the

21 arrangement with Puerto Rico, the answer is yes.  And we

22 think that that follows from its status as a United

23 States territory because of two parts of the Territory

24 Clause.

25             The first is that territories belong to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 United States, meaning that they are under the

51

2 sovereignty of the United States.

3             And then second, that Congress is the one

4 who makes the rules.

5             And if I could just make one more point,

6 which is historically, the fact that Congress was 

7 that the United States was the sovereign and the only

8 sovereign in the territories was very important at the

9 time that the Constitution was put together.

10             You may recall that the United States had

11 land there through the Northwest Ordinance, but it was

12 trying to figure out what to do with, and there were

13 questions with the States, what would happen.  And so

14 that this provision needed to be added to the

15 Constitution to make clear that Congress was the one who

16 was going to make rules for the territories, and that it

17 would be under the sovereignty of the United States.

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  But there are some

19 things 

20             MR. SAHARSKY:   and in this 

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's go back to the

22 insular cases right there.

23             There are different kinds of territories.

24 It's because of that that Frankfurter says that the

25 Constitution has left the field of invention open.  The

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
52 1 decisions in the insular cases mean this, if they mean 2 anything:  That there's nothing in the Constitution to 3 hamper the responsibility of Congress in working out 4 arrangements. 5             Now, if that's so, why couldn't Congress 6 delegate, without the power to take it back, the 7 authority to Puerto Rico to work out its own criminal 8 code subject to the constraints of the Bill of Rights, 9 et cetera?  Why couldn't it?  I mean, if Frankfurter is 10 right.  Or do you take the opposite position, that it 11 couldn't? 12             MS. SAHARSKY:  The insular cases were 13 talking about something different and narrower, which is 14 whether all the protections of the Bill of Rights apply 15 to the territories by their own force.  But to answer 16 the broader question that you answered, or asked, we 17 think that it's inconsistent with the grant of authority 18 to Congress in the Constitution for a territory to be a 19 territory but no longer be sovereign, because the 20 Territory Clause defines territories of the United 21 States as subject to the authority of the United States. 22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think it's not 23 possible, Ms. Saharsky  I mean, putting aside whether 24 Congress has done it here, but you think it's simply not 25 possible for Congress to confer sovereignty in the sense
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 that would matter for the Double Jeopardy Clause?

53

2             MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, it certainly could by

3 making it a State 

4             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.

5             MS. SAHARSKY:   or by making it

6 independent.

7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But  but  but not short

8 of that.

9             MS. SAHARSKY:  We think that that would just

10 be fundamentally inconsistent with the constitutional

11 design.  And if I could just maybe give the  the last

12 part of my historical answer, because I think it's very

13 important, is:  When this provision was put into the

14 Constitution, it was coupled with the New States Clause,

15 and it was understood that the options for sovereignty

16 were statehood.  It was not that if this was a

17 territory, that the territory was controlled by the

18 United States, and I think it would have been very

19 surprising to the States in the constitutional

20 conventions to think that when States were defined as

21 such important things in the Constitution, sharing the

22 sovereignty with the United States, that Congress could

23 somehow create a sovereign territory.  We just don't

24 think that's correct.

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Suppose Congress could also

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
54 1 say, could it not, that  in its criminal code, that if 2 a crime has been prosecuted and under Puerto Rican law 3 it will not be  the same  the same crime will not be 4 prosecuted under Federal law? 5             MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, I think there  6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Couldn't it say that if it 7 wanted to? 8             MS. SAHARSKY:  I think there are two 9 different options.  Congress can define what crimes are 10 and whether they are crimes in Puerto Rico, as opposed 11 to somewhere else.  So if that's what you're suggesting, 12 yes, I think that's what Congress could do.  What we 13 don't think that Congress could do is change the meaning 14 of the Fifth Amendment and the Double Jeopardy Clause, 15 because that's something for this Court. 16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  No  well, but  no, 17 certainly Congress cannot  cannot deny double jeopardy 18 effect to something that would be double jeopardy, but 19 I'm talking about a statute that says, even though it 20 might have double jeopardy effect, we say  we say no. 21             MS. SAHARSKY:  Well  right, and what I'm 22 saying is I think Congress' ability is to define crimes 23 and to set out what  what they are and where they are, 24 but if the question is what the Fifth Amendment permits 25 and doesn't permit, we really think that's up to this

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it's not a matter of

3 what the Fifth Amendment permits.  Congress just says,

4 we will  the Justice Department will not prosecute a

5 crime that has already been prosecuted in  in Puerto

6 Rico.

7             MS. SAHARSKY:  Right.  And the Justice

8 Department can work with Puerto Rico to decide who will

9 prosecute what crimes.  In fact, we do that as a general

10 matter so that there's usually not any overlap of the

11 kind that occurred in this case.  But I think that's

12 just a very different thing from suggesting that Puerto

13 Rico is a sovereign under the Double Jeopardy Clause.

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, no, I understand that.

15             MS. SAHARSKY:  But they're looking at it 

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm just saying, if you

17 like that result, it can be done by the statute.

18             MS. SAHARSKY:  Right  I'm sorry if I

19 misunderstood the question.  I'm just trying to be extra

20 careful, because 

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm trying to be helpful.

56 1             MS. SAHARSKY:  I just want to make sure that 2 I'm being clear, because I think this case does raise a 3 lot of important questions, and I do think that this 4 Court's jurisprudence over the past 100 years has been 5 very careful about what it means to be a double jeopardy 6 sovereign  7             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could you explain before 8 you sit down when and why the United States changed its 9 position on this question?  Because as I understand it, 10 in  in more than one brief, took the position that 11 Puerto Rico, for double jeopardy cases, is  for the 12 Double Jeopardy Clause is  is treated like a State. 13             MS. SAHARSKY:  That's right.  The government 14 took that position in two courts of appeals and defended 15 it in a brief in opposition to this Court, where we also 16 said the issue didn't matter.  But since that time, we 17 have revisited this issue, given substantial attention 18 to it, both within the Department of Justice and within 19 many agencies of the Federal government, and our 20 position as set out in our brief is that it is not a 21 separate sovereign.  And we think that that's entirely 22 consistent with the other things we've learned and the 23 testimony that DOJ and others have given to Congress 24 about Puerto Rico's current status and options for the 25 future.

57 1             The end of our brief talks about the task 2 force that the President has put in place, that has 3 issued reports three times over the past decade and a 4 half, which have said this is the constitutional status 5 Puerto Rico has now.  To the extent the people of Puerto 6 Rico want to change it, here are the options that are 7 consistent with the Constitution.  Tell us what you 8 want, and then Congress will decide where to go from 9 there. 10             So I would not want to suggest that as a 11 result of this case, that Puerto Rico's options are set 12 in stone.  We don't think that they are set in stone. 13 We just think that right now Puerto Rico is a territory 14 of the United States, and as a result it's not a 15 separate sovereign under the Double Jeopardy Clause. 16             And just to give the court the three data 17 points where the Court has said we're going to focus on 18 sovereignty under the Constitution and we're not going 19 to focus on autonomy or level of control, you have the 20 Puerto Rico v. Shell case which was where the Court said 21 Puerto Rico already has autonomy, but they're still not 22 a double jeopardy sovereign.  You have Waller, which is 23 about municipalities and the State of Florida trying to 24 basically treat its municipalities as a sovereign, and 25 the Court said, no, no, no, you are not in the same
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
58 1 relationship to your municipalities as the States are to 2 the Federal government; the municipalities are more like 3 the territories, there's a different ultimate source of 4 authority.  And then the Court, with respect to the 5 Indian tribes, said even though Congress has the ability 6 to legislate for the tribes, they still have this 7 inherent source of authority that predated the 8 Constitution and was recognized in the Constitution. 9             So for the Court to turn away from that, we 10 think, would really upend that precedent, and not for a 11 good reason, because  I think I'd like to conclude, if 12 I can, where I started, which is:  This power, this dual 13 sovereignty power, is a weighty power the Court has 14 reserved for those entities that have the ultimate power 15 under our Constitution, defined in our Constitution. 16 And for that reason, Puerto Rico, despite its 17 significant selfgovernment, is not a sovereign under 18 the Constitution. 19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 20             Four minutes, Mr. Landau. 21          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU 22                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 23             MR. LANDAU:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 24             If I could very briefly just say that 25 there's two real questions here, as the questioning has
Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
59 1 brought out.  First, what happened in 1950 to '52?  And 2 B, if so, is that constitutional? 3             There's no question, if you look at the 4 documents of 1950 to '52, that Congress required Puerto 5 Rico to have a Republican form of government, which is a 6 government by the people, of the people.  This was 7 understood at the time to be a new experiment.  This was 8 not just another organic act.  And the Constitution of 9 Puerto Rico, which was approved by Congress and the 10 President, says the power, the political power of the 11 Commonwealth emanates from the people.  And Congress 12 recognized that.  Okay.  So that goes to the what 13 happened. 14             Then you go to the real meat of the case, 15 which is the constitutional argument.  It is shocking 16 that the Respondents and the United States government in 17 this case are using the Territorial Clause as a 18 restriction on power, a limitation on power of 19 government.  This is so ironic, for exactly what Justice 20 Breyer was saying:  That the insular cases, if they 21 stand for anything, mean that Congress has plenary 22 control over the territories.  That means that Congress 23 can come up with inventive solutions which are broader 24 than the only menu that they give, which is a colony 25 governed pursuant to direct or delegated Federal power,

60 1 statehood, or independence.  Where do they get this view 2 that you can't come up with something inventive like the 3 Commonwealth, or the estado libre asociado, as Justice 4 Breyer said?  This is the genius of our system, that it 5 allows us to have these unincorporated territories  6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Landau, would you 7 explain what "estado libre asociado" means in Spanish? 8             MR. LANDAU:  It means "free associated 9 state," literally, and again, I think  10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Literally. 11             MR. LANDAU:   it has the concept of free 12 and it has the concept of associated, and state, in 13 estado. 14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you know why they 15 didn't use that phrase in the compact with the United 16 States? 17             MR. LANDAU:  I think they thought that  18 that Commonwealth was the more natural English word. 19 I'm not sure, Your Honor. 20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I believe, because I've 21 seen the Act, that they didn't because States have a 22 different meaning in the United States. 23             MR. LANDAU:  And again, we are certainly not 24 saying that we are a State.  Again, that was the whole 25 genius of the Commonwealth.  It allows flexibility by

2 solutions.  So 

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The Solicitor General's

4 office claims that Grafton says that when we're looking

5 at double jeopardy, we're looking at something

6 different.  We're looking at territory versus state.  Do

7 you agree with that reading of the Shell case and of

8 Grafton?

9             MR. LANDAU:  Absolutely do not agree that

10 Grafton said that in any and all contexts, that

11 regardless of any kind of territory, it is invariably

12 going to have that political relationship.  Grafton was

13 describing the particular relationship there, where the

14 Governor of Puerto  of the Philippines was appointed

15 by the President.  He 

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And how about Shell?

17             MR. LANDAU:  Just to finish that one point,

18 Your Honor, Grafton  it was called Grafton v.

19 United States because the Phillipine prosecution was

20 brought in the name of the United States.

21             Shell is exactly the same thing.  The Shell

22 case said that was pursuant to an Organic Act, but

23 things changed in the 50s fundamentally.

24             I'm not just saying this.  This court

25 recognized in the whole series of decisions in the '70s

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 that there was a fundamental transformation and that

62

2 Puerto Rico represents a very unique constitutional

3 experiment in our history, about how we have an

4 unincorporated territory that exists in longterm

5 association with the United States, but being the

6 creator of its own government, which is very important

7 to the people of  of the  of the government.

8             If there's one thing you read, please, in

9 our reply brief, read that Frankfurter memo because he,

10 as the law officer in the Department of War, addressed

11 exactly this issue.  And please do not take the

12 Constitution of Puerto Rico away from the people of

13 Puerto Rico.
