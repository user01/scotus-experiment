 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 first this morning in No. 00-1519, United States against
 5 Ralph Arvizu.
 6 Mr. Schlick.
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 9 MR. SCHLICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 10 please the Court:
 11 Since Terry, this Court has held repeatedly that
 12 reasonable suspicion analysis requires a common sense
 13 evaluation of the totality of the circumstances. The
 14 decision below is fundamentally inconsistent with that
 15 rule because it requires law enforcement officers to
 16 disregard potentially relevant facts when determining
 17 whether investigative stop is warranted. 
 18 This Court's decisions in Cortez and Sokolow are
 19 especially clear in rejecting attempts to put categories
 20 of facts off limits. In Cortez, the Court held that a
 21 vehicle's route, the timing of its trip, and its capacity
 22 for carrying illegal aliens together established
 23 reasonable suspicion, notwithstanding that each of those
 24 facts independently might be consistent with innocent
 25 travel.

3 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 In Sokolow, the Court rejected a rule that would
 2 have limited officers' ability to consider the personal
 3 characteristics of suspected drug smugglers. The Court
 4 held that that sort of rule adds to the difficulty of
 5 applying the reasonable suspicion standard. It does not
 6 ease it. And the Court further confirmed that innocent
 7 facts, facts consistent with innocent travel, in
 8 themselves may together establish reasonable suspicion.
 9 In this case, the Ninth Circuit attempted to
 10 establish a rule that would bar categorically
 11 consideration of certain facts that the court deemed
 12 innocent. That -- that rule presents two fundamental
 13 problems. 
 14 The first is that it doesn't accommodate the
 15 subtleties of real world encounters. For every
 16 categorical rule, there would have to be exceptions and
 17 subrules, and even if law enforcement officers could be
 18 asked to master those, they would still then have to
 19 anticipate new situations, and those rules could not
 20 provide guidance when --
 21 QUESTION: Mr. Schlick, you said this is an area
 22 in which one can use one's common sense, and I thought
 23 that what the Ninth Circuit was telling us was that some
 24 items in that list under all circumstances wouldn't cast
 25 suspicion. And one was -- had a certain familiar ring

4 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 with me that when you see a police car, you slow down. 
 2 This wasn't a car that came to a screeching halt or was
 3 trying to dodge it, and then it just slowed down. And
 4 isn't that a most natural reaction? 
 5 MR. SCHLICK: The problem, Justice Ginsburg, was
 6 that the Ninth Circuit didn't admit of situations in which
 7 deceleration might be relevant. For example, in the 
 8 Fifth Circuit's Villalobos case, which we cited in our
 9 brief, the law enforcement officer pulled in front of the
 10 vehicle that was suspected. The vehicle then slowed to
 11 drop back away from the law enforcement officer vehicle,
 12 and the Border Patrol officer in that case deemed that
 13 suspicious, that it appeared that the vehicle had changed
 14 its speed in order to increase its distance from the
 15 law --
 16 QUESTION: But they weren't talking about that
 17 case. They were talking about this case. And I thought
 18 what they were saying was that there was nothing
 19 suspicious about the slowdown here, and if that's all that
 20 you have, it won't do.
 21 MR. SCHLICK: Justice Ginsburg, we read the
 22 court of appeals opinion as attempting to establish
 23 categorical rules. On page 12a of the petition appendix,
 24 the court says, we attempt here to describe and clearly
 25 delimit the extent to which certain factors may be

5 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 considered by law enforcement officers in making stops
 2 such as the stop here. On the same page, slowing down
 3 after spotting a law enforcement vehicle is an entirely
 4 normal response that is in no way indicative of criminal
 5 activity. That -- that appears not to have made a -- the
 6 possibility that deceleration may in some context be
 7 suspicious. 
 8 And indeed, in the Ninth Circuit's Sigmond-
 9 Ballesteros case, decided after this case, the Ninth
 10 Circuit interpreted its decision in this case as holding
 11 that only certain factors may be considered by law
 12 enforcement officers when making stops. And it's -- it's
 13 that categorical rule that is inconsistent with the
 14 totality of the circumstances test. 
 15 QUESTION: I suppose it would be suspicious if
 16 -- if you're on a highway that has not only a maximum
 17 speed but a minimum speed, and -- and the car slows down
 18 20 miles below the minimum when it -- when it sees a
 19 police officer. That -- that wouldn't be a normal
 20 reaction, would it? 
 21 MR. SCHLICK: No. No, it would not. 
 22 QUESTION: And -- and do you think it's a normal
 23 reaction always to slow down when one sees a police -- a
 24 police car even if you happen to be going 10 miles below
 25 the speed limit already? 

6 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SCHLICK: It may depend on the particular
 2 area, and that's -- that may be a question on which you
 3 would look to the law enforcement officer's experience and
 4 expertise.
 5 QUESTION: I don't do it. Maybe you do it. But
 6 if I'm 10 miles under the speed limit already, I -- I
 7 don't immediately slow down when I see a police car. I
 8 don't know why you are willing to accept that as a -- as
 9 an image of reality that everybody slows down when you see
 10 a police car. If you're -- if you're going over the speed
 11 limit, I assume you do.
 12 MR. SCHLICK: I think your intuition accords
 13 with common experience and the holdings of most courts.
 14 QUESTION: There was a concrete record here of
 15 what this driver was doing, and he wasn't going 10 miles
 16 an hour. He was going a -- a normal speed.
 17 MR. SCHLICK: Justice Ginsburg, on page 57 of
 18 the joint appendix, Agent Stoddard testified that the
 19 extreme deceleration in this case, from about 50 to 55
 20 miles per hour down to about 25 or 30 miles per hour, was
 21 not normal and did set respondent's vehicle apart from
 22 ordinary traffic on those roads.
 23 QUESTION: What was the speed limit on the
 24 roads?
 25 MR. SCHLICK: Between 25 miles per hour and 35

7 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 miles per hour, Your Honor.
 2 QUESTION: And that's what he slowed down to.
 3 QUESTION: That was an established speed limit?
 4 MR. SCHLICK: Yes, Your Honor. In -- in the
 5 joint appendix, there are photographs which show speed
 6 limit signs, and it's 35 miles per hour down near the
 7 southern portion of the roads, 25 in the northern portion.
 8 QUESTION: What -- what was the portion where --
 9 where he slowed down? I mean, it was 25 to 35? No. It
 10 was either 25 or 35. What was it, do you know? 
 11 MR. SCHLICK: I -- I don't know for sure. I --
 12 I would guess it was 25, but I don't know for sure.
 13 QUESTION: But that's what he slowed down to. 
 14 So, he had been going above the speed limit.
 15 QUESTION: That sounds a lot more reasonable
 16 then. I mean, gee, if you don't slow down to the speed
 17 limit when you see a police car, you're in big trouble.
 18 (Laughter.) 
 19 MR. SCHLICK: Again, Agent Stoddard testified
 20 that that sort of deceleration, that speed, was not common
 21 in the area, and it --
 22 QUESTION: You mean they just keep zipping along
 23 at 50 despite seeing a police car. What part of the
 24 country is this anyway? 
 25 (Laughter.) 

8 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: It's Arizona. 
 2 (Laughter.) 
 3 QUESTION: What was the nature of the road? Was
 4 -- was it a regularly paved road? 
 5 MR. SCHLICK: No, Mr. Chief Justice. The road
 6 on which respondent was apprehended was a dirt road. It
 7 was a road that Agent Stoddard testified is used primarily
 8 by the local ranchers and by Forest Service vehicles and
 9 by the Border Patrol itself. It's -- it's not an improved
 10 highway. And it was extremely unusual, Agent Stoddard
 11 believed, for a vehicle, a minivan, to be on these roads,
 12 and it was a notorious smuggling route. 
 13 QUESTION: Is this one on exhibit 5 of the joint
 14 appendix, or have I got the wrong road there? Exhibit 5
 15 is Kuykendall Cutoff Road and Rucker Canyon Road.
 16 MR. SCHLICK: Yes, Justice Kennedy. The -- the
 17 photographs at the back of the joint appendix depict the
 18 route. They -- they moved from the southerly portion of
 19 the route up, as you get back to the later pages, toward
 20 the northern portion. Exhibit 24, for instance, is the
 21 intersection of Kuykendall Road and Rucker Canyon Road,
 22 which is very close to where the apprehension occurred.
 23 The maps in the joint appendix on pages 155 and
 24 157 show the area at issue. And you can see the first of
 25 those maps on page 155 shows the route beginning at the

9 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 bottom of the page in the center, Leslie Canyon Road. 
 2 Respondent then -- and that's -- that's paved for about 10
 3 miles, about the first 10 miles near Douglas. 
 4 Respondent traveled north on that road and then
 5 at the T intersection you see approximately in the middle
 6 of the page, by which point the -- the roads become
 7 unpaved, headed right, away from the Border Patrol
 8 checkpoint, away from the highway, which would take you
 9 north, through the dirt road, proceeded up Rucker Canyon
 10 Road, about three-quarters of the way up the page. That's
 11 an important intersection.
 12 QUESTION: Well, he turned left rather than
 13 right, didn't he? 
 14 MR. SCHLICK: I'm sorry. Turned -- turned right
 15 at the intersection, at that T intersection where Leslie
 16 Canyon Road jogs right, then stayed on Leslie Canyon Road,
 17 took a left on Rucker Canyon. And that was a critical
 18 turn. 
 19 Had he gone right, he would have been going
 20 towards the only recreation areas in the vicinity. And
 21 that might have explained the presence of cargo in his --
 22 in his minivan. Agent Stoddard could see that there
 23 appeared to be cargo on the floor of the van. But he
 24 instead turned left, away from the only -- the local
 25 recreation area and on a route that, if he then took --

10 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 took a right onto Kuykendall Road, which is -- which is
 2 again almost in the center of the page near the top
 3 between numbers 2 and 3 -- if he took that right on
 4 Kuykendall Road, then he would be circumventing the Border
 5 Patrol checkpoint which is indicated by number 1 on the
 6 left-hand margin of the page.
 7 QUESTION: The idea that he would eventually go
 8 north on Kuykendall and then take -- go west to rejoin 191
 9 north of the checkpoint.
 10 MR. SCHLICK: That -- that's right, and then
 11 head up to I-10, which would allow him to go to Tucson --
 12 Tucson or Phoenix, for example. And it was that route
 13 which Agent Stoddard testified is a notorious smuggling
 14 route, very rarely used by anyone except ranchers and
 15 Forest Service personnel --
 16 QUESTION: Although it is a route that could
 17 have been used by people going up to the Chiricahuas.
 18 MR. SCHLICK: It's -- it's possible, Your Honor,
 19 but --
 20 QUESTION: From Douglas. 
 21 MR. SCHLICK: -- the district court addressed
 22 that possibility on page 22a of the petition appendix and
 23 said that that would require a 40 or 50 mile trip over
 24 unimproved dirt roads. The most logical way to go is to
 25 take I-191 straight up I-181 and then across to Chiricahua

11 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 National Monument. 
 2 That's particularly significant in this case
 3 because the registration of the minivan was to a block
 4 that was just two blocks from I-191 in Douglas, and that
 5 makes it all the more inexplicable that a -- a vehicle
 6 that should know the roads would go out of its way to
 7 Leslie Canyon Road, rather than just going two blocks,
 8 picking up the highway and heading straight north. You
 9 know, that's -- that's the route that you would take if it
 10 were a long distance trip. 
 11 I said that the cargo couldn't be explained by
 12 the recreation area, because it had already passed the
 13 turn on Rucker Canyon Road. Nor could it be explained by
 14 a long distance trip because the highway is the road that
 15 you would take if you were headed on -- on a long distance
 16 with children with suitcases or overnight bags. 
 17 QUESTION: Mr. Schlick, could I come back to the
 18 -- to the slowing -- slowing up? I'm not quite sure what
 19 the -- what the Government's objection to the court's
 20 opinion is. I -- I would tend to think that -- that it is
 21 true, in the circumstances of this case, that if somebody
 22 is barreling along at 50, sees a police car, and slows
 23 down to 25, that is not at all suspicious. Indeed, I -- I
 24 might consider it suspicious if he continued barreling
 25 along at 50. 

12 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 So, you know, if your argument is that in the
 2 circumstances of this case, the slowing down was
 3 suspicious, I -- I don't think I agree with you. On the
 4 other hand, it is the case that the court of appeals
 5 seemed to have -- seems to say that slowing down can never
 6 be suspicious. 
 7 Now, which of the two are -- are you objecting
 8 to? Do you really think that -- I mean, that there was
 9 proper suspicion in this case simply because the person
 10 slowed down to the speed limit when he saw the police car?
 11 MR. SCHLICK: In this case, Justice Scalia, the
 12 deceleration is -- is not a factor on which the case would
 13 turn. There were other indications of nervousness which
 14 I'd like to discuss in a moment. 
 15 QUESTION: Okay. So, as to that factor, your --
 16 your -- really your only objection is you can't be as
 17 categorical as the court of appeals put the point. 
 18 MR. SCHLICK: That's -- that's exactly right. 
 19 We think it's a good example of the error of the court of
 20 appeals' approach. 
 21 But in this case, even looking at the factor of
 22 nervousness, there were other indications. After
 23 decelerating, respondent drove past the Border Patrol
 24 vehicle and stared rigidly straight ahead, without looking
 25 at or acknowledging Agent Stoddard, which --

13 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: May I ask this question? At the very
 2 page of the opinion that you call our attention to, the
 3 court of appeals said, in reaching our conclusion, we find
 4 that some of the factors on which the district court
 5 relied are neither relevant nor appropriate to a
 6 reasonable suspicious -- suspicion analysis in this case. 
 7 And are you agreeing with Justice Scalia that the slowing
 8 down in this case was not relevant?
 9 MR. SCHLICK: Justice Stevens, we would say that
 10 it had some relevance. It was -- it was not a
 11 particularly important factor, but it had some relevance. 
 12 The -- the court of appeals I think --
 13 QUESTION: Do you think the court of appeals
 14 erred in saying that in this case it had no relevance?
 15 MR. SCHLICK: Yes, Justice Stevens. 
 16 QUESTION: I see. 
 17 QUESTION: And what about -- what about, you
 18 know, not -- not waving to the police car as you go by? I
 19 don't know when I -- if I were ever exceeding the speed
 20 limit and saw --
 21 (Laughter.) 
 22 QUESTION: -- and saw a police car, it seems to
 23 me I would slow down and -- and try to give the impression
 24 that I wasn't slowing down because I saw the police car.
 25 (Laughter.) 

14 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: I mean, you know, you don't hit the
 2 brake and wave at the police officer. 
 3 (Laughter.) 
 4 QUESTION: So, why is that a suspicious factor? 
 5 I don't see why in the circumstances of this case that's a
 6 suspicious factor either.
 7 MR. SCHLICK: Agent Stoddard's testimony was
 8 that both respondent and his front-seat adult passenger
 9 stared straight ahead. The respondent gripped the wheel
 10 very tightly in -- in a position that Agent Stoddard
 11 deemed characteristic of someone who simply wants to melt
 12 into their vehicle if possible, and --
 13 QUESTION: Or maybe somebody who had been going
 14 50 miles an hour in a 25-mile-an-hour zone.
 15 MR. SCHLICK: Again, Agent Stoddard's testimony
 16 was -- was that respondent's behavior was -- was very
 17 unusual. 
 18 And after he saw those -- those and began to
 19 follow the minivan, there was another indication of
 20 nervousness, which was at the intersection of Rucker
 21 Canyon Road and Kuykendall Road. Respondent turned on his
 22 blinker, well ahead of the intersection, then turned it
 23 off, drove towards the intersection, and just before the
 24 intersection, made a sharp turn and turned on his blinker
 25 again, which again indicated uncertainty or nervousness,

15 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 which supported the inference that he was unusually
 2 distracted by the presence of the Border Patrol vehicle. 
 3 QUESTION: What's the testimony as to the amount
 4 of use this particular route got? How many cars a day,
 5 anything about how many cars a day or an hour came over
 6 it?
 7 MR. SCHLICK: The testimony, Mr. Chief Justice,
 8 was that this road -- the sensor hits on -- the Border
 9 Patrol maintains sensors along Leslie Canyon Road and
 10 Rucker Canyon Road, and that the first sensor on Leslie
 11 Canyon Road, which responded to northbound traffic, was
 12 triggered about once every 2 hours. 
 13 QUESTION: So, that would mean one car every 2
 14 hours? 
 15 MR. SCHLICK: Correct. And -- and that's
 16 directly relevant to the expected response. When you're
 17 in an area where one car travels approximately every 2
 18 hours, you're more likely to acknowledge perhaps a
 19 friendly wave -- another vehicle. This road was extremely
 20 remote, and again, most of the traffic was local vehicles
 21 from -- from the ranches, and the minivan was a vehicle
 22 which was not only unusual by type for this road, because
 23 it was not a four-wheel drive vehicle, but also had the
 24 capability of carrying a large amount of concealed cargo,
 25 which made it well-suited to smuggling activity. This

16 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Court noted in Brignoni-Ponce that that is a factor that
 2 is potentially relevant when determining whether
 3 investigative stop is warranted in the border context.
 4 The -- the second problem with the court of
 5 appeals approach, in addition to the fact that it can't
 6 comprehend the subtleties the real world encounters, is
 7 that it's unrealistic to ask officers to put out of their
 8 minds facts that they see before them and believe to be
 9 relevant. Even if officers could do that, they would then
 10 be left to speculate about the hypothetical import of the
 11 imagined set of facts, and that's going to --
 12 QUESTION: One -- one of the things the Ninth
 13 Circuit said is just looking at this laundry list and just
 14 to throw everything in and mix it all up and say it's
 15 suspicious that the driver didn't look at the police
 16 officer or didn't wave, but it's equally suspicious that
 17 the children did wave. So, one characterization of that
 18 was damned if you do, damned if you don't. If you wave,
 19 that's no good, and if you don't wave, that's no good. 
 20 And I think that the -- the Ninth Circuit can't be faulted
 21 for saying it's not good enough just to list everything
 22 that happened and say it's -- everything the officer could
 23 perceive and say it was all relevant. Some of it is
 24 relevant and some of it isn't. 
 25 Why would, for example, the children -- how old

17 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 were the children, by the way?
 2 MR. SCHLICK: 12, 10, and 7.
 3 QUESTION: And the children were waving in the
 4 back, and something was to be inferred from that? 
 5 MR. SCHLICK: They weren't simply waving, Your
 6 Honor. Without turning toward the Border Patrol
 7 vehicle --
 8 QUESTION: They were waving forward. 
 9 MR. SCHLICK: Correct. 
 10 QUESTION: And -- and the car -- the police --
 11 the Border Patrol car was behind them.
 12 MR. SCHLICK: Correct. It may be expected that
 13 a Border Patrol agent would have some experience with
 14 children's reaction to him in his vehicle. And in this
 15 case he said he -- he hadn't seen anything like this. It
 16 went on for about 4 or 5 minutes. It was methodical. The
 17 children waved together, facing forward without -- without
 18 facing Agent Stoddard. 
 19 With respect to the damned if you do/damned if
 20 you don't argument, waving or not waving, the court of
 21 appeals ignored the fact that -- Agent Stoddard's
 22 testimony was that he deemed it suspicious that when the
 23 Border Patrol vehicle was stopped and respondent drove
 24 past, respondent didn't acknowledge him at all. After
 25 that, he turned and began to follow respondent's vehicle,

18 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 and it was only at that point that the children began
 2 their odd waving. So, it's a reasonable inference that
 3 having failed in his effort to avoid the -- the Border
 4 Patrol officer's attention, respondent then went to plan
 5 B, which was we'll attempt to -- to look like a family on
 6 -- on an outing, and one way of -- of perhaps deflecting
 7 the agent's suspicion is to have the children wave. But
 8 that resulted, from Agent Stoddard's perspective, in a --
 9 a very odd circumstance, and that's the exactly the sort
 10 of situation that the reasonable suspicion analysis --
 11 QUESTION: To -- to what extent, Mr. Schlick, do
 12 three judges, say, sitting in San Francisco or Los Angeles
 13 or nine Justices sitting here -- do we defer to the
 14 judgment in these matters of a Border Patrol agent on the
 15 scene? 
 16 MR. SCHLICK: Ornelas, among other cases,
 17 addressed that, Your Honor, and -- and held that it's
 18 appropriate to give due weight to the expertise and
 19 experience of law enforcement officers and local judges. 
 20 And in this case, both Agent Stoddard and -- and the trial
 21 judge deemed this route to be unusual, to be associated
 22 with smuggling. It deemed -- the trial judge deemed the
 23 factors that I've enumerated to be significant in the
 24 context of what was going on out there, and I believe
 25 those are the trial judge's words. We have to look at

19 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 this in the context of what was going on out there. 
 2 The cargo, for example. He considered the
 3 possibility that it might just be camping supplies, but he
 4 said that would be -- that would be a possible inference
 5 were it not for all the other indications of illegality. 
 6 So, he -- he correctly undertook to analyze the facts --
 7 QUESTION: May I ask this question? I got the
 8 impression, in reading the officer's testimony, what he
 9 really did is once he checked and found where the car came
 10 from, where it was registered in a high drug area, that's
 11 what triggered his decision to stop the vehicle. And my
 12 question to you is supposing all he knew was the very
 13 unusual circumstances of a family driving in an area
 14 that's mostly driven through by ranchers and -- and not
 15 families. That fact, the rare amount of traffic on the
 16 road, and the -- and the location from which the car
 17 originated, would that be enough in your view?
 18 MR. SCHLICK: If you --
 19 QUESTION: -- put aside all these rather unusual
 20 things like waving and slowing down and so forth. Would
 21 those three facts be enough in your view to justify the
 22 stop? 
 23 MR. SCHLICK: As -- as I understand your
 24 question, no, I don't think they would be. But when you
 25 start adding factors such as missing the turnoff to the

20 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 recreation areas, such as carrying the concealed cargo --
 2 QUESTION: Well, missing the turnoff is part of
 3 the location, as I say. The unusual location of the
 4 vehicle at the time of the stop. Is that -- and the fact
 5 it was not the normal. You normally see ranchers or -- or
 6 Border Patrol people. You don't normally see families out
 7 there. That's a -- that's a road that is not usually
 8 used. Is the -- I'm just wondering if the rarity of the
 9 -- of the general scene plus the fact that they did --
 10 that the officer did check and find that this vehicle was
 11 registered in the -- in the area known for drug smuggling,
 12 was that enough? I think you said no.
 13 MR. SCHLICK: Is -- in your hypothetical,
 14 Justice Stevens, is the fact that it was a minivan?
 15 QUESTION: Yes.
 16 MR. SCHLICK: Yes, yes. If you knew that it was
 17 a minivan, which was out of character, suited to carrying
 18 aliens, and knew that the route had been taken, that last
 19 turn onto Kuykendall Road, north so that the minivan would
 20 not approach the checkpoint, then yes, there would be
 21 reasonable suspicion.
 22 QUESTION: In other words, you're saying -- what
 23 you're saying I think is that even if the Ninth Circuit
 24 were correct in disregarding the waving and the slowing
 25 down and the failure to wave once, you'd still have a

21 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 reasonable suspicion.
 2 MR. SCHLICK: Yes, Justice Stevens. It would be
 3 our position that even if you consider only the three
 4 factors that the court of appeals considered categorically
 5 in the analysis -- that would be the route, the fact that
 6 it was a minivan, and the time. The time was when the
 7 Border Patrol was likely to have stepped down its
 8 surveillance. The court of appeals held if you considered
 9 those factors, there was no reasonable suspicion. We
 10 would disagree and say even if you only consider those
 11 factors, there was reasonable suspicion. But the
 12 appropriate analysis is to consider all the factors
 13 collectively, and then clearly there were grounds for the
 14 stop. 
 15 If the Court has no further questions --
 16 QUESTION: I have another question, if -- if you
 17 have the time. 
 18 This checkpoint is about 30 miles north of the
 19 border. Was there also a checkpoint in the --in the town
 20 from which the car originated? I'm just a little puzzled
 21 at what the -- at the setup here, why there's the
 22 checkpoint 30 miles from the border, and whether or not
 23 there was one closer to the border. 
 24 MR. SCHLICK: There -- there's a border
 25 inspection station in -- in Douglas, but the Court

22 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 explained in Martinez-Fuerte the -- the criteria the
 2 Border Patrol uses to establish its fixed checkpoints, and
 3 I think those criteria continue to hold true today. One
 4 of them is that the checkpoint should be outside, about 25
 5 miles from the border, because 25 miles is the zone in
 6 which a border crossing card allows an alien to travel. 
 7 So, you would -- so, you would be stopping aliens who were
 8 -- who were legally there because of their border crossing
 9 card. 
 10 Also, you want your checkpoint to be somewhat
 11 remote from -- from the population center. Douglas is a
 12 town of about 15,000 people. And you want your -- your
 13 checkpoint to capture traffic which is heading north, away
 14 from the border, rather than just local traffic within
 15 that area. 
 16 QUESTION: And then the other question I had is
 17 about the sensors. There were two sensors triggered in
 18 this case, as I understand the record. Are there -- are
 19 the sensors spotted purely in order to identify every
 20 vehicle that uses this particular road that this -- this
 21 man used?
 22 MR. SCHLICK: The sensors are magnetic sensors
 23 which are directional. So, they don't pick up southbound
 24 travel, which would -- which would not be consistent with
 25 smuggling away from the border. They do pick up all

23 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 northbound traffic. So, it would pick local --
 2 QUESTION: Well, they picked up not only the
 3 northbound, but also the fact that he turned right the
 4 first time. No, left the first time. He passed the
 5 Rucker Canyon Road. 
 6 MR. SCHLICK: Yes. In this case there were two
 7 sensors. One was before Rucker Canyon Road. When that
 8 sensor was triggered, Agent Stoddard began to drive
 9 towards respondent to -- to check out the sensor hit. And
 10 then a second sensor was triggered after respondent turned
 11 left on Rucker Canyon Road and away from the national
 12 forest. 
 13 QUESTION: Away from the recreational area. 
 14 MR. SCHLICK: That's right. 
 15 QUESTION: Yes. 
 16 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Schlick. 
 17 Ms. Brambl, we'll hear from you.
 18 ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTORIA A. BRAMBL
 19 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 20 MS. BRAMBL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 21 please the Court:
 22 I wanted to respond to the question that you
 23 asked, Mr. Chief Justice, about who should we give due
 24 weight to and who is going to know better, the officer in
 25 the field, the district court, or the court of appeals. 

24 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 And certainly the decision in Ornelas v. United States
 2 does instruct us that we give weight -- we review for
 3 clear error the -- the factual findings that the district
 4 court made. However, inferences from those findings that
 5 the district court makes and -- and that the officer makes
 6 are reviewed. They're reviewed giving due weight to
 7 those. That is not as strict or rigorous as the standard
 8 as for clear error. 
 9 And then finally, Ornelas -- that decision
 10 really wanted and instructed the courts -- the courts of
 11 appeal to issue opinions that were instructive to firm up
 12 the precedent and to offer guidance to everybody, to
 13 officers in the field, to litigants, to district courts. 
 14 And really, the Ninth Circuit in this case -- they handle
 15 the lion's share, over two-thirds of -- or approximately
 16 two-thirds of the border stop cases come from the Ninth
 17 Circuit. They also have developed experience. They've
 18 developed both practical experience in seeing these cases
 19 over and over again and seeing neutral and rote factors
 20 offered over and over again that really don't have any
 21 weight. And they're instructing through this opinion and
 22 several other opinions that they've issued over the last
 23 20 or 30 years --
 24 QUESTION: All those -- that type of opinion
 25 seems to me contrary to our opinion in Sokolow where we

25 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 said you just can't categorize these kind of factors and
 2 say that this kind of thing is never useful and something
 3 else is always useful. 
 4 MS. BRAMBL: I think that all the parties agree
 5 that the totality cannot have categorical rules because --
 6 QUESTION: Well, then certainly you -- you must
 7 -- you're not defending then some parts of the Ninth
 8 Circuit opinion. Is that correct? 
 9 MS. BRAMBL: I think that some of the language
 10 that the Ninth Circuit used was inartful in that it made
 11 it sound -- if you take one sentence out of the whole
 12 opinion, it would make it sound like they were creating
 13 categorical rules. But when you read everything, the
 14 whole opinion, in the context, they do cite all of the
 15 cases this Court has decided: Sokolow, Terry, Cortez,
 16 Brignoni-Ponce, Wardlow. They say that they consider
 17 everything.
 18 But then they go through factor by factor. And
 19 I do defend the way they went about that, separating out
 20 the factors and discussing them because it seems that that
 21 would be the only orderly way to go about the analysis,
 22 and the only way to -- to offer an opinion that really
 23 does give some instruction and guidance. 
 24 QUESTION: How -- how is that? I was quite
 25 disturbed actually by the opinion because I thought there

26 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 were five or six Supreme Court cases that say this is just
 2 the kind of opinion you should not write. So, then I -- I
 3 went through it, and it says, for example, one of the
 4 factors, the fact the minivan slowed, is prohibited by our
 5 precedent. Well, my own common sense reaction would be it
 6 all depends. If he was going 40 miles an hour and slowed
 7 to 10 in -- in 2 seconds, I'd say, why in the middle of
 8 the desert did he feel compelled to slow so much? I -- I
 9 suspect people don't give tickets in Arizona for driving
 10 50 miles in the middle of the desert. Maybe they do, but
 11 it doesn't say that. I think it would depend. 
 12 He says that the fact that a van is registered
 13 to an address in a block notorious for smuggling is of no
 14 significance and may not be given any weight. 
 15 Then there are four or five others which are
 16 listed where the second factor is of questionable value.
 17 The failure -- he has five of them there, which say our
 18 precedent says you give no weight. 
 19 Now, I just don't see how to square that either
 20 with Ornelas, Sokolow, or five other precedents of this
 21 Court, as well as with common sense, because it seems to
 22 me it would all depend. 
 23 MS. BRAMBL: Well, I certainly agree that --
 24 that there may be circumstances in which where you live or
 25 slowing down could be. With respect to the first one,

27 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 where they do say squarely prohibited by our precedent,
 2 they go ahead and -- and then relate instances where
 3 slowing down -- where they do find that this is
 4 suspicious. Just merely the act of slowing down they have
 5 determined, using common sense and -- and I think a lot of
 6 the comments this morning illustrate that if maybe not a
 7 universal reaction, it's so common to slow down when you
 8 see a law enforcement officer, that it's meaningless.
 9 QUESTION: Maybe -- maybe we really don't know
 10 enough to say that. I -- I was engaging in that
 11 conversation with the Government's counsel. But -- but in
 12 point of fact, I'm not sure what the reaction is, as -- as
 13 Justice Breyer puts it, out in the middle of the desert.
 14 For one thing, I don't know whether -- whether
 15 Border Patrol officers can give speeding tickets. For
 16 another thing, I don't know whether it's generally known
 17 that Border Patrol officers cannot give speeding tickets.
 18 And therefore, I don't know whether it's, indeed, quite
 19 common out in the middle of the -- of the vast desert of
 20 Arizona for people to go barreling along at 50 miles an
 21 hour past a Border Patrol agent and ordinarily to wave and
 22 say hi. 
 23 (Laughter.) 
 24 QUESTION: These are all matters that I'm sure
 25 the Border Patrol agent was aware of, and perhaps the

28 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 district court. I'm less certain that the court of
 2 appeals out in San Francisco was -- was aware of all of
 3 those things. Why shouldn't I give the Border Patrol
 4 agent and the district court the benefit of the doubt?
 5 MS. BRAMBL: Well, the agent -- like so many of
 6 the factors in this case, the agent didn't really tie down
 7 or tie into his experience why slowing down would be
 8 predictive or indicative of not just speeding but of
 9 criminal activity such as alien or drug smuggling, which
 10 was the reason that he was out there. 
 11 QUESTION: Well, he said, people, when they see
 12 my Border Patrol car, normally don't slow down. He
 13 certainly said that, and he found that to be unusual. 
 14 Now, why -- why should I think that that is false?
 15 MS. BRAMBL: Well --
 16 QUESTION: Do you know, as a matter of fact,
 17 whether Border Patrol agents give speeding tickets? 
 18 MS. BRAMBL: I think that that's an open
 19 question. 
 20 QUESTION: It's an open question whether they
 21 give speeding tickets? 
 22 MS. BRAMBL: But I believe that generally --
 23 QUESTION: Don't they have other things to do?
 24 MS. BRAMBL: They do have other things to do. I
 25 believe that if driving would be characterized as

29 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 dangerous where maybe the public was in jeopardy, that
 2 they would be authorized to make a stop, but just because
 3 someone is speeding or violating an Arizona traffic law, I
 4 don't believe that they would make such a stop.
 5 But I wanted to point out that the Ninth Circuit
 6 opinion went on, after they said that this factor was
 7 squarely prohibited, to say the kinds of ways that slowing
 8 down or a deceleration would be indicative of reasonable
 9 suspicion or would -- would have some weight. And they
 10 characterized that as evasive driving where -- where
 11 perhaps the Border Patrol is seen and then there's an act
 12 of evasion as well as deceleration.
 13 QUESTION: Ms. Brambl, the -- the district court
 14 ruled for the Government in this case, and the Ninth
 15 Circuit reversed. And I don't see that in the district
 16 court's opinion, which the court of appeals was -- was
 17 reviewing, that same laundry list that appears in the
 18 Ninth Circuit's decision. So, what I don't understand is
 19 if you just take the district court's opinion, what did
 20 the district court rely on that could be questionable? 
 21 The district judge did not rely on the children waving, as
 22 I recall. 
 23 MS. BRAMBL: Well, the district court judge did
 24 refer to that, but what's -- what the -- the court of
 25 appeals picked up on, which the district court didn't, was

30 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 all of the inferences that -- and subjective beliefs that
 2 this waving entailed because it wasn't just -- the
 3 children were facing forward and waving forward. So, it
 4 was a big leap that they were even waving at the agent to
 5 begin with and an even bigger leap that the agent made
 6 that they were coached to do so, presumably by the driver
 7 or the adult passengers. And that's what the Ninth
 8 Circuit seized on.
 9 And another big deficiency with this is how does
 10 waving or waving in a mechanical, odd way, as the district
 11 court found -- how would that be tied in to criminal
 12 behavior? And the record doesn't indicate how.
 13 QUESTION: How do we know from the record what
 14 kind of wave it was? What -- what he says in his
 15 testimony is they kind of stuck their hands up and began
 16 waving to me like this. Well, I'm sorry. 
 17 (Laughter.) 
 18 QUESTION: There we are. Okay? 
 19 Now, the person who saw that was the district
 20 judge, and the way it was characterized by the policeman
 21 is it wasn't in a normal pattern. It looked like they
 22 were instructed to do so. And without being able to see
 23 what he did, it's a little tough for me. And -- and so, I
 24 don't know. What the courts both say is it doesn't add
 25 much. 

31 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 The odd thing about the court of appeals opinion
 2 is it seems to suggest, because it doesn't prove the case,
 3 it's not relevant. Now, I -- I mean, what's the response
 4 to that? 
 5 MS. BRAMBL: Well, I think that -- that goes to
 6 the heart of the issue presented by this case, which is
 7 what can the court of appeals exclude as factors, even if
 8 they do it on a case-by-case basis. Can they look at
 9 factors and just say, you know what, this is so marginally
 10 relevant or completely weightless that we're not going to
 11 -- to count it in the equation? And although I don't
 12 defend this --
 13 QUESTION: But it does seem as though the Ninth
 14 Circuit was trying to suggest that no other court could
 15 consider it in the calculus either in the future and --
 16 and was making some kind of effort to develop some more
 17 rigid guidelines than we've seen in the past.
 18 Let me tell you what concerns me very frankly. 
 19 We live in a perhaps more dangerous age today than we did
 20 when this event took place. And are we going to back off
 21 from totality of the circumstances in an era when it may
 22 become very important to us to have that as the overall
 23 test? And I'm concerned that the Ninth Circuit opinion
 24 seemed to be a little more rigid than our precedents
 25 require or that common sense would dictate today.

32 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. BRAMBL: Well, I certainly agree that
 2 totality and reasonableness has to remain flexible, and
 3 that given the times that we live in, that perhaps
 4 adjustments are going to be made. Thankfully this case I
 5 don't know presents the -- the specter of that. 
 6 And it -- it seems that what the Ninth Circuit
 7 tried to do in this case was to really provide some
 8 meaningful guidance. They could have just listed the
 9 factors in a very straight forward way without any
 10 discussion and just said, you know what? We add all these
 11 together and there's no reasonable suspicion. And we
 12 probably wouldn't be here today. However, what they tried
 13 to do I think is to provide some guidance for everybody
 14 because when we get these cases as --
 15 QUESTION: When we have said that the test is
 16 totality of the circumstances, the amount of guidance that
 17 can be provided by -- by a court is -- is somewhat
 18 limited.
 19 MS. BRAMBL: It is but there's a surprising
 20 repetition of factors. This Court in --
 21 QUESTION: A surprising repetition of factors by
 22 the Ninth Circuit.
 23 MS. BRAMBL: Well -- well, even this Court in
 24 Ornelas recognized that certain fact patterns were
 25 similar, such as Sokolow and Royer and a few others, that

33 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 really -- given how fact-specific they are, there really
 2 is, especially when you start looking in border areas
 3 where -- for instance, there are a number of stops where
 4 there are checkpoints and -- and people claiming that
 5 perhaps these people are on the road for checkpoint
 6 evasion purposes. 
 7 QUESTION: Yes, but -- but you know, checkpoints
 8 vary too. The checkpoint north of San Diego is -- is in a
 9 heavily populated area where things may be quite different
 10 than out here in the Sulphur Springs Valley where there
 11 aren't very many people. 
 12 MS. BRAMBL: Well, sure. It seems that -- that
 13 if you look through, for instance, just Ninth Circuit
 14 opinions, or if you go over to Fifth Circuit and Tenth
 15 Circuit, but also look at the -- the border areas, you do
 16 see surprising number of repetition, even though perhaps
 17 some are in very urbanized areas and some are in rural
 18 areas.
 19 QUESTION: Well, that's -- that's true. The
 20 officers are -- are trained to tell the district court,
 21 the finder of fact, all of the factors that entered into
 22 their judgment. It seems to me, though, a fair reading, a
 23 necessary reading of the Ninth Circuit's opinion, that we
 24 now have seven factors that every officer in the Ninth
 25 Circuit must memorize and not rely on. And I just don't

34 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 see how that's consistent with the ability of the police
 2 to perform their work or consistent at all with our
 3 opinions. And as the court -- as the Government has told
 4 us, the Ninth Circuit itself has construed this opinion in
 5 subsequent cases precisely that way.
 6 MS. BRAMBL: Well, the Ninth Circuit, even since
 7 this opinion, still examines all of the factors. They
 8 still look at the totality even in the Sigmond-Ballesteros
 9 case that the Government cited in its briefs. However --
 10 QUESTION: You have a point that's a serious
 11 point I think. The first time I see a case where the
 12 policeman testifies I -- I stopped this individual because
 13 he looked nervous as he came away from the airplane down
 14 to the baggage counter, and he looked both ways, and then
 15 there was sweat on his upper lip and he walked around the
 16 baggage thing, and then, looking around, went over to his
 17 suitcase -- the first time you see that, you think, well,
 18 that makes sense to me. But when you see exactly the same
 19 thing 15 times, you begin to wonder. Now, that I guess is
 20 your point.
 21 MS. BRAMBL: Well, it -- well, it is.
 22 QUESTION: Okay. Now, what do we do about that? 
 23 I had thought that the way to deal with it is -- totality
 24 of the circumstances is the way to deal with it, not
 25 having rigid rules that say you can never consider whether

35 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 his -- he was sweating or wasn't sweating. In other
 2 words, I don't see how a rigid rule helps. It puts too
 3 many cases on one -- it gets the wrong cases. It doesn't
 4 draw a sensible line. 
 5 Now, what's your view of that? I see your
 6 problem. I want to know the solution. 
 7 MS. BRAMBL: Well, I think that the solution is
 8 to allow courts like the Ninth Circuit and other circuits
 9 to say, look, we see the same thing time and time again,
 10 and it really has very little or no meaning. Officers, we
 11 want you to tell us why this factor is suspicious. It's
 12 not going to be enough anymore to come in and just say, he
 13 looked nervous, he slowed down. And --
 14 QUESTION: But that -- and I -- I think your --
 15 your point is -- is well taken as far as you go, but it
 16 seems to me that that's not going to help the Ninth
 17 Circuit opinion here because what you're saying is don't
 18 rely on highly general factors which are so general that
 19 we really, in the abstract, don't know where they point. 
 20 Be more specific. Give us facts not conclusions. But
 21 that's not -- that's not what the Ninth Circuit said. The
 22 Ninth Circuit, in effect, said, well, we're -- we're
 23 simply going to exclude certain categories of fact.
 24 MS. BRAMBL: Well, as I said, the language the
 25 Ninth Circuit used could have been a lot more clear and a

36 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 lot more artful.
 2 QUESTION: Well, it might have said what you
 3 said, but it didn't say what you said. I mean, isn't that
 4 so?
 5 MS. BRAMBL: Well, they did say frequently, and
 6 in effect, when there was a rehearing in this case, they
 7 amended the opinion to add under the circumstances of this
 8 case and in this case on many, many times. 
 9 QUESTION: Maybe not often enough. 
 10 (Laughter.) 
 11 MS. BRAMBL: It would have helped. 
 12 QUESTION: Because -- because initially the
 13 opinion did read categorically we don't consider slowing
 14 down, we don't consider kids waving, and then they threw
 15 in a lot of under the circumstances in this case, not in
 16 -- in every instance, but in a number of cases. That's --
 17 the amendment seems at odds with what the original opinion
 18 was, which seemed to be saying we have three categories
 19 here: never relevant, sometimes relevant, always relevant.
 20 MS. BRAMBL: And I think you're right. They --
 21 I wouldn't say that they were categorical in excluding,
 22 but they -- they certainly did seem to suggest that --
 23 that certain factors were not relevant, and they did add
 24 in this case. And basically if someone comes into court
 25 with the exact same factor and they're not able to show

37 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 why that's relevant or probative in this case, why this
 2 factor isn't neutral and does have an inference of
 3 criminal activity, then that factor, if you follow the --
 4 the other courts follow the Ninth Circuit's opinion it's
 5 going to -- it's going to be excluded. It's not going to
 6 be considered as relevant or probative. 
 7 I think that that is the kind of guidance that
 8 the circuits should be offering. 
 9 QUESTION: Well, one thing that the circuit
 10 didn't do and it did puzzle me was when I read the
 11 district court's opinion, I thought the district court was
 12 saying, yes, I could go along with they're in a recreation
 13 area. But when it came to a certain point and they made a
 14 turn, it made no sense at all because if that's where they
 15 were going to go, they should have gotten right on the
 16 highway. That seemed to be unanswered, that. Why wasn't
 17 -- the -- the Ninth Circuit didn't deal with that as
 18 precisely as the district court did.
 19 MS. BRAMBL: That's true, but the Ninth Circuit
 20 did point out -- and if you look at the map that's on --
 21 on page 157 of the joint appendix -- that's the map that
 22 we submitted in connection with this case and that the
 23 district and the -- the Ninth Circuit considered -- it
 24 shows that -- it's got a lot more detail, as far as a lot
 25 of the destinations. And when the Government said that

38 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 really there weren't any destinations beyond Rucker
 2 Canyon, beyond where the stop occurred --
 3 QUESTION: Where you turn onto Kuykendall?
 4 MS. BRAMBL: Yes. Once you turn onto that road
 5 and you keep going, you can see to the east there's a
 6 number of campgrounds, a number of areas, including --
 7 QUESTION: The Chiricahua?
 8 MS. BRAMBL: Yes. 
 9 QUESTION: Yes, but to go from Douglas to
 10 Chiricahua National Monument would be -- would be
 11 extremely odd to go the route this minivan took. You'd go
 12 up -- up 191 and cut over above the checkpoint.
 13 MS. BRAMBL: Well, the van was appropriate for
 14 that road and the conditions, and I would point out that
 15 when the agent had --
 16 QUESTION: Well, if it's appropriate, if it's --
 17 it's also appropriate to go on a paved highway, I take it.
 18 MS. BRAMBL: Well, sure, but --
 19 QUESTION: I mean, why would you go up this
 20 very winding road to a place that you can get to much more
 21 quickly by going up a paved highway?
 22 MS. BRAMBL: It might be a -- a matter of
 23 preference and -- and taste. But these areas are
 24 beautiful and --
 25 QUESTION: Well, you know, all of these factors

39 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 -- as Justice Breyer suggested, we're not saying that they
 2 would prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt or that they
 3 would amount to probable cause. But all we're talking
 4 about is reasonable suspicion. 
 5 MS. BRAMBL: But it isn't suspicious for a
 6 family from Douglas to use a road that leads right from
 7 Douglas, that start out -- that starts out 10 miles paved,
 8 to go through a beautiful area up to perhaps Chiricahua
 9 Monument or some of the areas along there on the --
 10 QUESTION: Yes. You can't -- it's obviously
 11 nothing criminal. But what -- what did the respondent
 12 say, that he was going to meet somebody there? 
 13 MS. BRAMBL: That's correct.
 14 QUESTION: What's -- how does that tie in with
 15 going to a recreational area?
 16 MS. BRAMBL: Well -- well, it really doesn't
 17 because we know that he was involved in illegal activity,
 18 but that's the hindsight of what the officer found after
 19 the stop. And the -- the --
 20 QUESTION: Would you comment on a -- on a phase
 21 of the case that keeps puzzling me? The -- the sensors on
 22 the road. It must be that the -- that there was some
 23 suspicion on every vehicle that went up here because I
 24 guess the first sensor that was triggered caused the
 25 officer to -- to go over and take a look at the vehicle,

40 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 and that happened rarely enough, so you make a special
 2 examination of every vehicle that trips the sensor. And
 3 then if they trip the second sensor, that's -- they're
 4 doubly suspicious. And how -- how relevant is that in the
 5 whole picture? 
 6 MS. BRAMBL: Well -- well, I think what's
 7 important to recognize is that when you look at the maps,
 8 there aren't too many roads that lead anywhere from
 9 Douglas because it's right on the border. So, there's the
 10 main road, the paved one, that the district court that Mr.
 11 Arvizu should have taken, and then there's this dirt road,
 12 the unpaved one, which is quite well-maintained, and they
 13 have sensors on that to catch all the cars that avoid the
 14 checkpoint. 
 15 But my point is that every road that leads away
 16 from the border is suspicious to some degree and can be
 17 labeled that way. It happened to be --
 18 QUESTION: It is particularly suspicious if
 19 there's a much more rapid route available, rapid and
 20 comfortable. If you got three kids in the car, you
 21 generally don't want a bumpy road. 
 22 MS. BRAMBL: Well, they were going 50 to 55
 23 miles per hour. 
 24 QUESTION: I know. 
 25 MS. BRAMBL: And there was no testimony that the

41 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 car was flying -- the van was flying all over the place,
 2 which -- which tells me -- and the pictures bear it out --
 3 is that this wasn't -- it was a dirt road and it was in a
 4 -- a fairly isolated area, not full of houses and -- and
 5 whatnot. But this was a decent road.
 6 QUESTION: It's not only an isolated area, but
 7 the testimony was that the people who normally used the
 8 road were locals, ranchers or others, that it was not a
 9 road frequently traveled by families. 
 10 MS. BRAMBL: However, the -- that was the
 11 testimony by the Border Patrol agent.
 12 QUESTION: Right. 
 13 MS. BRAMBL: The investigator from our office
 14 testified that this road was used and enjoyed by all kinds
 15 of families. The Chiricahuas are a beautiful area. 
 16 There are a number of areas within them that -- that are
 17 visited by people from all over, and because they're
 18 basically in the -- in the residents of Douglas' back
 19 yard, people from Douglas frequent that area. So, we
 20 don't have a record as to how many sensor hits turn out to
 21 be smugglers, how many turn out to be ranchers, and how
 22 many turn out to be people from Douglas visiting the area.
 23 QUESTION: But we do have a record that suggests
 24 that every time somebody trips the sensor, they go out and
 25 take a look at them. 

42 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. BRAMBL: That's true. 
 2 QUESTION: Yes. 
 3 MS. BRAMBL: And -- and it would be a shame if
 4 -- if every family on a road like that or on that road in
 5 a minivan on a holiday would be subject to heightened
 6 scrutiny just because this happens to be a road where
 7 smugglers sometimes use it. And --
 8 QUESTION: Is there any indication there ever
 9 has been such a family? I mean, I imagine if there were
 10 an innocent family that happened to accidentally come from
 11 an area where there is a lot of smuggling, that doesn't --
 12 you know, not everybody is a smuggler in such an area. 
 13 They drive with their family just for recreation 50 miles
 14 out of the way. Their children wave oddly. 
 15 (Laughter.) 
 16 QUESTION: They screech to a halt, and there
 17 they were, stopped. I -- I guess they would be sort of
 18 outraged and there might be some publicity about it. Has
 19 there been such a --
 20 MS. BRAMBL: Well, one of the problems with --
 21 with Fourth Amendment issues is that the vast majority of
 22 innocent people that are protected by the Fourth Amendment
 23 often remain silent when they are subjected to arbitrary
 24 or -- or random stops. 
 25 QUESTION: I'd feel much more sympathetic to --

43 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to that person than -- than I would to your client whose
 2 -- whose argument essentially is, yes, I was indeed a
 3 smuggler, but -- and he suspected me to be a smuggler and
 4 he turned out to be right. But the suspicion was not
 5 accurate. I don't understand that. Should we give any
 6 weight to the fact that he turned out to be right? Does
 7 that -- does that have any bearing on whether the
 8 suspicion was reasonable or not? 
 9 MS. BRAMBL: It doesn't. In fact, if we had
 10 that kind of test, then we would have no way to litigate
 11 reasonable suspicion issues because the only way we get to
 12 court --
 13 QUESTION: I'm not saying it's conclusive. I'm
 14 just saying, you know, I'm -- I'm more inclined to find
 15 that the Border Patrol agent who stops a smuggler had a
 16 reasonable suspicion than I am to find that a Border
 17 Patrol agent who stops a -- a happy family out on outing
 18 had a reasonable suspicion.
 19 MS. BRAMBL: Well, the problem is there weren't
 20 really any factors or --
 21 QUESTION: How would one know about the stops of
 22 someone who is a perfectly law-abiding citizen? Nobody is
 23 pressing charges against them. Quite the contrary. And
 24 very few of them would bother with a Bivens action given
 25 the qualified immunity. So, we don't hear from those

44 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 people. And I thought the whole idea of the Fourth
 2 Amendment, frankly, is that you have to protect the crooks
 3 because if you don't protect them, then the innocent, the
 4 law-abiding people will lose their protection. 
 5 MS. BRAMBL: That's exactly right. The -- the
 6 Fourth Amendment protects all of the law-abiding people,
 7 and it seems like Terry struck a balance. You -- you can
 8 stop people when you have reasonable suspicion, but that's
 9 the floor below which you cannot go because otherwise
 10 you're casting in a large universe of -- of innocent, law-
 11 abiding citizens who are going to be stopped. And they're
 12 the people that we're concerned about in this litigation.
 13 And obviously our client is not a sympathetic
 14 figure because he was doing something wrong. But all of
 15 the objective factors that were available to the agent
 16 pointed not to a smuggler running dope or aliens, but
 17 instead to a family that was on an outing on a -- a lovely
 18 day on a -- a very scenic area. 
 19 All of the factors that the Ninth Circuit found
 20 had some level of suspicion, the fact that it was a
 21 minivan, the fact that it was a road that could be used by
 22 smugglers and could be used to avoid the sensor, and the
 23 fact that it was 45 minutes before a Border Patrol shift
 24 change -- all those are really just the setting. When you
 25 get to the individualized factors that were listed, those

45 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 factors are the ones that fall short. 
 2 QUESTION: Well, but just before the shift
 3 change is an individualized factor.
 4 MS. BRAMBL: Well --
 5 QUESTION: I mean, we're not saying that anytime
 6 someone comes along this road it's suspicious. We're
 7 saying it's suspicious just before the shift change.
 8 MS. BRAMBL: Well, it's certainly 45 minutes
 9 before a shift change when perhaps, depending on where the
 10 agents are out in the field, some of them may be returning
 11 back. But it -- it would seem inappropriate to say,
 12 families, you better find out when Border Patrol shift
 13 changes are because otherwise you won't -- you travel on
 14 these roads, you're going to get stopped. And --
 15 QUESTION: Would you explain to me the
 16 significance of the shift change? I frankly didn't quite
 17 understand. 
 18 MS. BRAMBL: Well, the Border Patrol claims that
 19 smugglers, in general, are aware of when they change
 20 shifts and --
 21 QUESTION: But what difference would it make --
 22 does that make? 
 23 MS. BRAMBL: Well, the thought is that smugglers
 24 would then think they're getting by because all of the
 25 agents are at the -- at the station. The truth of it is,

46 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 we see this factor so often throughout the -- the
 2 published cases, that it seems a strategy, if it is one,
 3 that does not work because --
 4 QUESTION: But the idea would be that the Border
 5 Patrol agents were all at the checkpoint and wouldn't be
 6 out in the field to -- to be able to follow up on any
 7 information from the sensor. 
 8 MS. BRAMBL: That's exactly right. 
 9 QUESTION: But I still don't understand because
 10 that would be at the moment of the change. 20 minutes
 11 ahead of time some will be coming in, and 20 minutes after
 12 some will be going out. They're still within -- within
 13 time to react to a sensor, which they did. 
 14 MS. BRAMBL: Well, sure.
 15 QUESTION: It still really puzzles.
 16 MS. BRAMBL: And that's the point we were able
 17 to make in the -- in the record that the -- the court of
 18 appeals reviewed, which is that when -- exactly when shift
 19 change would occur and when the agent --
 20 QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Brambl.
 21 MS. BRAMBL: Thank you. 
 22 QUESTION: Mr. Schlick, you have 5 minutes left.
 23 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK
 24 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 25 MR. SCHLICK: Mr. Chief Justice, unless the

47 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Court has further questions, we submit that the judgment
 2 of the court of appeals should be reversed. 
 3 QUESTION: Tell me. Explain to me again why the
 4 shift change is so significant. 
 5 (Laughter.) 
 6 MR. SCHLICK: Certainly, Justice Stevens. The
 7 -- the testimony was that agents who are out in the field
 8 will, as the 3:00 p.m. shift change approached, head back
 9 to --
 10 QUESTION: Right.
 11 MR. SCHLICK: -- the checkpoint on I-191. That
 12 drive would take perhaps 45 minutes, perhaps a half hour,
 13 perhaps as much as an hour, depending on where they were.
 14 So, during that period, a Border Patrol agent who was,
 15 let's say, stationed on Leslie Canyon Road, supervising
 16 the road, would be driving back. 
 17 QUESTION: He'd be driving back, but at the same
 18 time the sensors are working. If the sensor is triggered,
 19 they tell him -- they say, turn around and go back, which
 20 is what happened to this guy. I just don't understand it.
 21 MR. SCHLICK: That's true. And Justice Stevens,
 22 you may be thinking more clearly than smugglers. What
 23 smugglers see is the absence of Border Patrol vehicles,
 24 and they take that as an indication that --
 25 QUESTION: Does the record tell us whether it

48 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 was generally known that there were sensors on this road?
 2 MR. SCHLICK: The record does not. It does not
 3 reveal that, no, Your Honor.
 4 QUESTION: I had the feeling it might be a
 5 different case if they just put a sign up saying,
 6 strangers in this area are subject to stop if they're not
 7 -- you know, if they're not local people. We got sensors
 8 that will catch you. But if they gave them notice, I
 9 wonder if it would be a different case. 
 10 MR. SCHLICK: Certainly, Justice Stevens, the
 11 smugglers are well aware of the location of the checkpoint
 12 and the route to -- to evade it.
 13 QUESTION: But not of the sensors you think.
 14 MR. SCHLICK: I -- I can't answer that question.
 15 The record doesn't reveal. 
 16 QUESTION: Are there -- is there anything in the
 17 record that suggests at all, or anywhere, that there are
 18 other -- there are families, that sometimes people do use
 19 this for picnics? They like sightseeing. They want to go
 20 up there on this old dirt road. Is there any -- any
 21 evidence on that at all? 
 22 MR. SCHLICK: The record does include evidence
 23 that the recreation areas off of Rucker Canyon Road -- if
 24 respondent --
 25 QUESTION: Well, that's one of them, but there's

49 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 one further to the north. So, somebody who likes driving
 2 on old dirt roads, as some people do, might take their
 3 family, drive up there, going further to the north. So, I
 4 wonder what the state of the -- any evidence at all in
 5 there that -- that families who are not smugglers do use
 6 this road once a week, once a day, once a month. 
 7 Anything?
 8 MR. SCHLICK: No, Justice Breyer. The -- the
 9 testimony was that that recreation area to the north
 10 existed. There was no testimony that any particular
 11 number of -- of families do, in fact, use these roads. 
 12 The testimony to the contrary was that ranchers and Forest
 13 Service personnel and the Border Patrol itself used these
 14 roads. The district court's finding on page 24a of the
 15 petition appendix was that this route was not a logical
 16 route to get up to the Chiricahua National Monument.
 17 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.
 18 Schlick. 
 19 The case is submitted.
 20 (Whereupon, at 11:10 a.m., the case in the
 21 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
