    "speech": "We'll hear argument now on number 01-521, The Republican Party of Minnesota, et al., versus Verna Kelly. Mr. Bopp."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Like most states, Minnesota selects its judges through periodic popular elections. And when candidates' speech is severely restricted, the people are denied access to the information they need to make an informed choice. While state court judges are different from other elected officials, Minnesota's Announce Clause, as now interpreted by its supreme court, goes too far resulting in elections without campaigns."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Could we find out from you just what the Announce Clause prohibits that isn't already prohibited by the Pledges and Promises Clause, as it's been interpreted?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Yes, Justice O'Connor. The Announce Clause prohibits, according the decision of the Eighth Circuit, any general -- allows general discussions of the law, while it prohibits any implying of how a person would rule -- a candidate would rule, on an issue or case before the Court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "How does that differ, then, from the Pledges or Promises Clause?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "The Pledges and Promises Clause prohibits any pledge or promise that -- other than faithful performance of duties in office. The difference between \"announce,\" the plain language of the clause, and \"pledge or promise\" -- \"announce\" is simply making known, is one of the formulations of the Eighth Circuit, or implying; while \"pledging or promising\" is making a commitment on how you would rule in a future case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But you think the Announce Clause, even as interpreted by the Eighth Circuit to be the same as the ABA canon, goes beyond that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, there is one aspect of the current 1990 ABA canon that has -- was not discussed by the Ninth Circuit or by the ABA brief. And that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And where does that appear in your brief? Where is the ABA canon we're talking about? Where is it? I want to look at it while you're talking about it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "I do not have a reference to the ABA canon, Your Honor. I apologize. The ABA canon states that a -- the 1990 ABA canon states that a candidate may not make statements to commit, or appears to commit in deciding cases, controversies, or issues likely to come before the Court. While the ABA and the Eighth Circuit seem to imply that the 1990 canon was similar, if not the same, as the 1972 canon, they did not discuss the difference between the words \"announce\" and \"commit.\" \"Commit,\" if you look in the dictionary, says \"pledge.\" And, thus, the 1990 canon appears to be more narrow under plain --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, the Eighth Circuit did say that it was -- that Minnesota's provision is the same as the ABA canon, right?"

  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "It did, Your -- it did, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And the ABA canon prohibits candidates, judicial candidates, from making statements that commit or appear to commit a candidate."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And that looks very much like the Pledge or Promise language. I -- I don't know how we should interpret this."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Well, one of the problems, Your Honor, is that the January 29th opinion of the Minnesota Supreme Court interpreting the Announce Clause adopted the Eighth Circuit opinion and its interpretations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Unfortunately, the Eighth Circuit had conflicting statements about the scope of the interpretation that it was announcing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, you were -- you appear to be arguing, in your brief at least, that the Announce Clause is unconstitutionally vague."

    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But did you make that argument below?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Yes, we did, as to the interpretation proffered in the district court, adding the words \"likely to come before the Court.\" But where we are now, Your Honor, is that the Eighth Circuit sua sponte added other glosses to this canon, even though it was not advocated by any of the parties."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You didn't include a vagueness challenge in your petition for certiorari, did you?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Yes, we did."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is it in the question on which we granted cert, do you think?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "No, but it is encompassed within the violation of the First Amendment that we allege."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But I wouldn't have thought vagueness was a First Amendment issue."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Well, in the context of First Amendment protected speech, a -- something that chills First Amendment speech, because of -- it is a vague rule, and therefore does not provide a bright line necessary for the exercise of that speech, that it constitutes a First Amendment violation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "One of the statements of the Eighth Circuit -- and I don't have the citation to the brief; I have the citation to the Federal Third -- 247 F.3d 881. It says that the Announce Clause applies only to discussion of a candidate's predisposition on issues likely to come before the candidate if elected to office."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "That is one of the three constructions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If we could -- would you agree that that's perhaps the narrowest of the three constructions? I want to find what might be the most likely statement to survive review and then have you discuss that, because I take it that you would not be -- you would not agree that even that is constitutional."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "It is not the narrowest, Your Honor, because it uses the word \"issue.\" There are other formulations --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "-- in the Eighth Circuit case where they use the word \"decide a case,\" such as on page 45a of the petition -- the petition appendix. It prevents candidates from, quote, \"implying how they would decide cases,\" end of quote. And they also, on page 52a of the appendix to the petition, say that, quote -- that the canon, quote, \"applies only to discussions of a candidate's predisposition on issues,\" as you've quoted, and then finally concludes on page 53 with the statement that it prohibits candidates, quote, \"only from publicly making known how they would decide issues.\" So we have conflicting interpretations of --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, let's take the -- let's take the last one. I take it, if that were the authoritative narrowing constructing that were before us, you would disagree with its constitutionality."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Would you agree that that would be a constitutional standard if it were part of a code of judicial ethics that applied to the judge after the judge was on the bench?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "No, and -- but I believe that this canon does apply to judges once they are elected and on the bench."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, are judges, after they are on the bench, subject to, all of the same rights that they have before they go on the bench, insofar as making public comments?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "No, they may be limited in a number of different ways, Your Honor, that are necessary to advance compelling interests."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, why is it that, if an election is in July, the State can, under your view, not prohibit statements in June before he's elected, but they can prohibit the statements in August, after he's elected?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, the First Amendment applies -- has its most urgent application in campaigns for election, and it is -- and while both judges and judicial candidates may be limited in their speech, it has never been held that simply announcing your views on a disputed legal or political issue constitutes an indication of partiality such that would justify, for instance, recusal or disqualification."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But I thought you said it would be okay. Then maybe I didn't understand your answer. I thought you said that the kind of limitation that Justice Kennedy referred to would be all right for sitting judges, that you could prohibit sitting judges from letting their views be known on any controversial issues."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Well, then I misspoke, if that was your understanding."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- you think you could prohibit judges from discussing those matters."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "No. Canon 4 -- and in fact, Canon 4(b) of the Minnesota canons encourages judges to propose changes in the substantive and procedural law, even individually."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Sitting judges -- sitting judges run for election. So whatever rights the contender would have in an election, I assume that the sitting judge who was running for reelection would have those same rights, in your view."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "We believe that they should."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Because the sitting judge could not be restricted, could he or she, in a way?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Well, sitting judges are restricted, for instance, from commenting on pending cases that are pending before them, quite properly. But here we are talking about stating general views about the law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So sitting --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You wouldn't object to candidates being prohibited from commenting about particular cases either, would you?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "No, I would not."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speech": "We --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- wouldn't permit that, would you?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "We believe that that can properly be --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I thought you gave examples, or your -- one of the briefs gave examples of commenting on specific decisions that had been rendered by the Minnesota Supreme Court, and you said that restraint on that comment was impermissible."

    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Am I not right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Yes. That is our position."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So you're making --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That was a past case. That was a distinction you're making between past cases and pending cases in the court that are likely to come before you if you're elected."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Yes, I -- the First Amendment protects discussion of past cases. However, the Eighth Circuit opinion only allows discussion of past cases while the enforcement authorities, specifically the Office of Lawyers Professional Responsibility, had previously said that you could criticize those opinions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, supposing that -- supposing that Minnesota -- the Minnesota Supreme Court had announced that its Fourth Amendment was more protective than the federal Fourth Amendment and a candidate running for that court saw that several cases, the evidence had been suppressed in Minnesota courts, the defendant was acquitted, so he said, \"I think we should go back to the idea that our Fourth Amendment is the same as the federal Fourth Amendment.\" Would that be permitted under this rule?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Under the Announce Clause?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Under the Announce Clause."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Not if it's considered implying how you would rule in a future case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But do we know that -- do we -- is there any mechanism for getting a clarification? And the big problem in this case is this is a frontal attack, and so we have no specific examples. And you can say, \"I think this would fit, and I think that wouldn't fit.\" Is there any mechanism in Minnesota for seeking clarification? For example, whether the Minnesota Supreme Court's current rule is, indeed, the ABA's 1990 rule?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "You can seek a private advisory opinion that is not binding on either the office or the board. And petitioner Wersal sought such an opinion after suit was filed regarding other matters, and they declined to provide that advice."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Bopp, I would assume your answer would be that if it's too fuzzy for us to understand what it means in order to rule upon its constitutionality, it's also too fuzzy for a judicial candidate to know what it means in order to conform his conduct to it and, therefore, unconstitutional."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Yes, sir, Your Honor, not only to candidates, but this canon binds the family members, the supporters of the candidate. If they say anything that is viewed to violate this construction -- this new construction of this rule, then the candidate, him or herself, is subject to discipline or removal from office."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I still want to make clear your position. Your position is -- is that the judge can, after the judge's election, be disciplined, sanctioned for certain remarks that he could not be sanctioned for before the election. Is that correct?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor, and if I gave you that impression, I apologize."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "In other words, the rule --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",

    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "The rule --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- to speak are the same."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "The rule is the same. But I think the point I was making was that once a judge assumes office, there are restrictions on, for instance, his ability to discuss a pending case that is not imposed upon a lawyer that is not involved in the case in any way."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, do you claim --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "So then --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "All right. Then your position is that there is a difference as it applies to pending cases as to which a sitting judge has to -- to which a sitting judge has been assigned."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "-- BOPP",
    "speech": "Yes, there are specific ethical"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And that's all."

    "speech": "And that's appropriate --"
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Now --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "-- an appropriate limit."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And those are what?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "It's in the realm of Pledges and Promises. It would apply to candidates whether they're sitting judges or not, and that is that a candidate for judicial office shall not pledge or promise certain results in deciding a particular case or issue in a case without regard to the law or facts of the case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Suppose he said, \"There are a lot of criminal cases pending,\" and, to take the Chief Justice's hypothetical, \"we've gone too far in interpreting the Fourth Amendment, and I'm going to be more strict.\" In your view --"

  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "I think that's a --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- that could be prohibited."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",

    "speech": "He says, \"I promise when these cases come before me, this is what I'll do.\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I'm surprised you take that view."
  },

    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, there is a public perception of the impartiality of the judiciary that I think properly can be taken into account."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "And I think this rule announces a rule that is consistent with the judge's obligation to decide cases in accordance with his or her role."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, that's an extremely fine line you're drawing, it seems to me, because I think a moment ago, in response to my question, you said that a candidate would be prohibited, and wrongly prohibited, under your view -- on your view of it and from saying that Minnesota should adopt the federal Fourth Amendment standard rather than the more liberal Fourth Amendment standard that the Supreme Court of Minnesota hypothetically had it. You say that a candidate ought to be allowed to do that, but he isn't under the Minnesota rule?"
  },

    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "He is not, under the -- well, to the extent that we know what the Announce Clause means --"

In your view, can the State prohibit the candidate from saying, \"I've been reading about this case. I know what the evidence is, and I believe so and so should be convicted, and I think the sentence ought to be the following.\" Could the State, consistently with the First Amendment, prohibit that kind of a comment?"

  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Yes. And while judges certainly have views, and they announce these views in numerous different ways, if they are binding themselves not to have an open mind and to decide a case in advance, then that is a violation of the oath, and that type of pledge or promise should be and can be prohibited under the First Amendment."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is this different from that? That is, I read through the Minnesota Bar Association's brief, the ABA's brief, and portions of the Brennen brief. All right? They all suggested to me that this ethical rule, like all ethical rules, is vague, interpreted by interpretive opinions, of which there are many. I mean, there are two pages of them in these briefs. Now, as I understood it, it comes down to an effort to do just what I did in my own Senate confirmation hearing, to say, \"I will try to reveal my judicial philosophy. I will try to stay away from anything that is going to commit myself or appear to commit myself about how to decide a future case.\" All right."

  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, it is such a problem to know exactly what the provision covers now. It isn't clear to me. And what we end up with at the end of the day is a system where an incumbent judge can express views in written opinions, and perhaps otherwise, as well, and yet a candidate for that office is somehow restricted from discussing the very same thing in the election campaign. That's kind of an odd system, designed to what? Maintain incumbent judges, or what?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "No, it's not, Your Honor. In fact, that is not correct in terms of the effect of that situation. Again, if you look at page 20 of the Joint Appendix, what the executive director of the Lawyers Board has said is that an incumbent judge can criticize the prior decision of that sitting judge. So that the challenger actually has greater opportunity than an incumbent judge, because an incumbent judge has a record of decisions."

    "speech": "Your Honor, our position is, just as the ABA indicated, that our rule is the functional equivalent of a commitment clause."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "The Minnesota Supreme Court turned down the ABA rule, the ABA rule -- we're talking -- they're both ABA rules. Minnesota now has on its books the 1972 rule. The 1990 rule is the one that you said is the functional equivalent of the current rule. And yet the Minnesota Supreme Court considered and turned down that rule. So that's one of the aspects of this case that makes it very fuzzy. The court that turned it down now says, \"We agree with the Eighth Circuit.\" And you're telling us that the Eighth Circuit has adopted, essentially, the ABA's current rule."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, and that is the case, and you are right. Back in 1995, there was discussion of adoption of the commit clause by the Minnesota Supreme Court. It did not occur at that time. There has been a lot that has evolved over the last seven years, Your Honor, and the Minnesota Supreme Court has made the decision in its January 29th, 2002, order that this construction by the Eighth Circuit is the construction that they are going to place on their clause."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Whatever that is."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Well, this construction, Your Honor, is, for all practical purposes, identical to the commitment clause. And --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Gilbert, may I ask --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- a question based on what you said about stare decisis? You say -- have said consistently you can discuss your judicial philosophy. Well, why wouldn't one's position on stare decisis fall under judicial philosophy?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "I think it would, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So that -- so you're changing back then, because you said a while ago that stare decisis -- if you said, \"I think that decision about the Fourth Amendment was wrong, and I don't believe in stare decisis,\" you said you couldn't put those two together."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Your Honor, you can put them together. I think the question was, could someone then conclude from that what the ramifications would be if that particular candidate came to the Supreme Court, for example, on what the candidate would do with respect to that decision -- whether the candidate would overturn or not."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And your answer was it would imply how he's going to vote and, therefore, would not be --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Again --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- would not be acceptable, right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, with the distinction being to protect the integrity of the judiciary."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, let me ask about that. You know, in evaluating whether a state has demonstrated the kind of significant interest necessary to abridge speech, it seems to me we have to look at the entirety of the state law to see what interest it's pursuing. I, frankly, am absolutely befuddled by the fact that Minnesota wants its judges elected -- that's its constitutional provision -- and then enacts statutory provisions that are intended to prevent the electorate from knowing, even by implication, how these candidates are going to behave when they get on the bench. It seems to me a total contradiction. And, indeed, it looks to me like a legislative attempt to simply repeal Minnesota's constitutional provision providing for the election of judges, which is a neat and easy way to get rid of it if you can't do it by plebiscite. Why does it make any sense to vote for a judge in an election, a judge who is not able, even by implication, to tell the electorate what kind of a judge he would be?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Well, but, Your Honor, that's the fallacy in that statement, is that a candidate can tell the electorate what kind of candidate they are. The only thing that the candidate cannot say -- it's a very limited restriction -- and that is, how I am going to decide a future case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Not a particular -- well, no, not just a future case, a future issue -- any, not a particular case, but any issue --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "And --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- how I will vote on the Fourth Amendment situation, how I will vote on the incorporation doctrine. I can understand your saying, he shall not commit himself, \"I promise to vote this way.\" No judge should do that. He should be able to be persuaded that he's been wrong. But to say that my current view is that the Fourth Amendment should be just like the federal Fourth Amendment, and stare decisis in constitutional matters is not a doctrine that I think is very strong -- it seems to me you ought to be able to say that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "And they can say that. I think the difference of opinion we have here is whether they can go the extra step and just say, \"And I would try to overturn the decision if I'm elected.\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, if that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "I have to --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- if that indicates a disqualification or a lack of temperament for the bench, the voters can decide that. The bar association and the judges can come out and say, \"We have a candidate running who doesn't have the right judicial temperament,\" and the voters decide. That's the way elections work."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "They can do that, but I submit to you, what happens if that judge wins? What happens if that judge wins and the litigants come before that judge who has prejudged that case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I suppose the people have said what kind of judges they want."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Oh, and it's all of a sudden majority opinion?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Why is that any worse than litigants who come before a judge who's already sitting and who has said in a prior opinion that he thinks the Fourth Amendment in Minnesota should be interpreted the same way the federal Fourth Amendment is? Why --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Because in --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- is that any different?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Because in a prior opinion, due process was accorded, because the judge actually heard the argument of the litigants, heard the facts and the applicable law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "You mean a judge can't have an opinion without hearing from all sides and going in briefs and so forth?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Absolutely."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, what if -- even if he gives a speech, does he have to first have this sort of vetting?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Not at all, Your Honor. The only -- again, the limited restriction here is that the -- a judge cannot -- I'm sorry -- a judicial candidate cannot prejudge a future case, cannot say, \"I think this statute over here is unconstitutional,\" or, \"I think, in consumer fraud cases, that anybody who wins is entitled to punitive damages.\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So you don't trust the electorate in Minnesota to decide whether a judge has a judicial temperament. You wish us to depart from the usual philosophy --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Again --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- that we do not allow the State to presume that the public is better off not having complete information."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Maybe we should know about this judge's temperament. And if he spouts off on all sorts of issues, we say, this is not the kind of judge we want."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Your Honor, again, this is a balance that's being struck. There's competing interests here. There's the First Amendment interest that we're all familiar with. There's the due process interest of individual litigants. There's the compelling governmental interests that the State has in ensuring the integrity of the judiciary, both in terms of the actual integrity and the perception of it. And that's why this limited restriction is appropriate."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Maybe you shouldn't have judicial elections if the last is a significant State interest."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, that's --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "To the degree that you're making it a significant State interest here. See, I just question whether it is a significant State interest, because you have a constitution that says, \"We're going to have judicial elections.\" Now, that may be a very bad idea, but as long as that's in your constitution, I find it hard to believe that it is a significant State interest of Minnesota to prevent elections from being informed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Well, again, Your Honor, we're trying to weigh the different interests. I am sure you wouldn't suggest that the State doesn't have a compelling interest in the integrity of the judiciary, and that is a competing interest that is being weighed here, and that results in the commitment clause that the ABA has adopted and the parallel provision that has been construed narrowly by the Eighth Circuit, which, again, only forbids or prohibits a judge saying, \"I'm going to decide this particular issue this way in the future.\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "So you're saying the public doesn't know enough in order to determine whether a judge has the requisite qualifications for office."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I'm not saying that the public knows or doesn't know. The concern is what happens if that candidate is elected, and then you or any other litigant comes before that candidate, who is now a judge, and tries to litigate the issue that the judge has already prejudged."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "How fair is that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "My goodness, we -- I think we have -- I will say present company excluded -- I know we have had judges on this Court who have answered questions about particular legal issues to the Senate confirmation hearing. Are you saying that those judges were disqualified from sitting in cases in which that issue would later come up?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor, I'm not. And actually, I'm surprised to hear that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is it -- oh. It's --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "I am surprised to hear that, in light of the testimony that is in our brief and other briefs --"

    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "But, Your Honor --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I actually found that when they approached a particular case about how you were going to decide in the future, both the senators -- in my experience, since it only concerns me -- would not press the issue of how you would decide a particular case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I'm not talking about --"
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Gilbert, do you think we should draw any distinction, or whether it would be reasonable for us to draw any distinction, between the application of the rule to the candidates themselves and the application of the rule to all of these ancillary individuals around them -- their associates, their families? Let's assume that we say that the rule passes muster with respect to the candidate. What's the justification for muzzling the candidate's spouse? I mean, I know, in fact, what --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- it is, because we figure, you know, that's how you get the message out. But do we have a more difficult First Amendment hurdle?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I don't think so, not at all. I think it's really a misnomer to talk about muzzling, which is what the petitioners have indicated."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Let's say \"limiting.\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Well, it's not even that. What the rule does is ask the judicial candidate to encourage close family members not to effectively circumvent the rule by announcing views that they might be aware of that the judicial candidate would support."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But if the family member says, \"Well, I'm going to tell anyway.\""
  },

    "speaker": "GILBERT",

    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "There's no --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But there could be. Do I understand that there would be an inquiry in that event as to whether the candidate had, indeed, encouraged the family member to be quiet?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Your Honor, the standard is \"knowingly permit.\" So, in other words, some -- the judicial candidate would actually have to be the actor behind those actions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "All right, but I want to know, in practical terms, what happens. The spouse makes a statement -- any one of the statements that have been mentioned here, except as suggesting prejudgment of a case. The candidate stays mute. I presume that a complaint would be filed against the candidate, and I presume the candidate would have to answer to the commission as to whether the candidate had, indeed, knowingly encouraged this."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I'd assume a complaint would not be filed under those circumstances."

  },

    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And I assume that there could be a complaint, simply based on the emphatic statement of the spouse. And my question is, does the candidate have to show, in that event, that he did not knowingly encourage, or does the State have to show -- or the prosecutor or whoever it is -- that he knowingly did encourage. What's the drill?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Yes, of course, the burden's on the State. And not only is it on the State, but the State would have to show by clear and convincing evidence."

    "speech": "Yeah, it's conceivable, Your Honor, but, again --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Counsel, is that -- is that part of the canon part of the question in this case? I know it's part of the canon. I didn't understand that it was presented to us in the petition. What's your view?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Your Honor, it's kind of oblique. The focus is on Mr. Wersal's comments. And then there are other comments. And I think one of the justices mentioned a vagueness challenge. To the extent there's any vagueness challenge at all that was discussed at the Eighth Circuit and is part of the petition, it deals with these third parties and the phase \"knowingly permit.\" And the issue --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Because we didn't have the interpretation that was later adopted --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- by the Eighth Circuit. What Counsel says is that the new vagueness issues that he's raising are a consequence of the opinion which your Supreme Court has adopted, the Eighth Circuit's opinion."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Well, we -- Your Honor, you're correct. However, the Eighth Circuit opinion is the opinion that's being appealed here. And what the petitioners have done is, they have refused to acknowledge that narrow construction. And the fact of the matter is that the Minnesota Supreme Court has now authoritatively adopted that as a state court construction. But the fact of the matter is, as well, that the Eighth Circuit already opined on what the standard is, and that issue was not raised by them, in terms of vagueness. It simply was not raised."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Was not raised where?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "In the petition."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "In the petition. The petition is whether it's, it unconstitutionally impinges on the freedom of speech. And one of the principles of freedom of speech is that you cannot -- you cannot chill speech by having a prohibition that is not clear. I don't think that this is a separate issue from the First Amendment issue at all."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Well, they have not --"
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "They certainly did in the reply brief."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "They have in the reply brief, but not in the petition, which was the question that was asked previously. And as to vagueness, I should say that this court has been really clear in the Broadrick v. Oklahoma case, for example, and the Colton v. Kentucky case, that sometimes rules and statutes -- and, frankly, all the time, rules and statutes are not conducive to mathematical precision, that there are going to be, as the Court has said, germs of uncertainty in how these laws are applied. And these laws are going to be applied based upon facts and circumstances. And in this particular case, I think it's really significant that we don't have any facts and circumstances as to what Mr. Wersal wants to say."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I think you could set up a system where you get advisory opinions, but I don't know that we've ever allowed that to be done in the First Amendment area."

  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, I don't -- Your Honor, first of all, I'm not a proponent of what -- of that. But in Letter Carriers, that was a critical consideration in upholding the Hatch Act against constitutional attack, because there was the ability of people who had questions about the application of the statute to actually go to an advisory board and get an opinion. Similarly here, both of the boards that are parties to this case do provide advisory opinions, and they provide them on short notice, as well. So there is that mechanism. I'm not suggesting it's a substitute, but it is a consideration in terms of if there is a close question on an issue and someone wants some assurance as to how that particular situation would be interpreted, they can go to the boards and ask that question."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Well, they actually do advisory opinions over the phone, Your Honor, on very short order, and they could do it in a matter of hours or days, depending upon what the needs are."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Gilbert, you brought out that this is not just a question of the candidate informing the voter, that behind all of this is a litigant who's going to be in a future case. How does it work in Minnesota? Suppose, to take an example that Mr. Bopp provided in his brief, the judge -- or the candidate is campaigning \"Tough on Drunk Driving.\" And then I'm a drunk driver, and I come before this judge, now elected, and I say, I want him to recuse, he said he's tough on drunk driving."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "Are you asking in the --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Would there be, under Minnesota law, a grounds to say, \"I don't want that judge, because he's announced in the election that he's tough on drunk driving\"?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GILBERT",
    "speech": "No, I don't think so, Your Honor, not under those circumstances. One distinction I would like to make here -- oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Gilbert. Mr. Bopp, you have three minutes remaining."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BOPP",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I don't think this is a matter of mathematical precision. The State brief, itself, states two different formulations of the rule. They say, quote, \"It is clear that the clause applies to statements about how they would decide, quote, issues, end of quote, on pages 1 and 47. And then they say it is, quote, \"clear,\" end of quote, that the announced clause applies to statements about cases. And that is on pages 12 and 37. The rule is not even clear in terms of the State's own formulation of its scope. Secondly, as the Joint Appendix indicates on pages 111 through 123, announcing your views also includes simply answering questions on radio interviews or after speeches. It is hardly a remedy for a candidate to call up the board or the office for an oral opinion which is not binding on them about whether or not they can answer a question on the radio. And, finally, it is undisputed that the people of Minnesota want an impartial judiciary. Governor Arnie Carlson, at Joint Appendix page 247, said -- who's a State's witness -- that people do not want judges who are pre-committed. Thus, candidates who would make excessive statements, who would appear to be partial, risk defeat at the polls in Minnesota. Thus, the people can be trusted to make the decisions that they, themselves, have conferred upon themselves, as long as they have the information they need to make that choice. The First Amendment guarantees that they should receive that information, which the Announce Clause both prohibits and chills. It is, therefore, unconstitutional."
