    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Although Chicago's ordinances cannot survive the faithful application of due process doctrines, there is an even simpler, more essential reason for reversing the lower court's judgment. The Constitution's plain text, as understood by the people that ratified it, mandates this result. In 1868, our nation made a promise to the McDonald family; they and their descendants would henceforth be American citizens, and with American citizenship came the guarantee enshrined in our Constitution that no State could make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of American citizenship. The rights so guaranteed were not trivial. The Civil War was not fought because States were attacking people on the high seas or blocking access to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment were understood to include the fundamental rights honored by any free government and the personal guarantees of the --"

And whenever they spoke about those unenumerated rights, they gave some concrete examples. So I think that there might be two categories of unenumerated rights if a claim were before the court under that provision. If a right is, for example, the sort of right that was mentioned in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the piece of legislation enacted by a supermajority of Congress, where the Congress said, over President Johnson's veto, here are the rights of American citizenship, and they are -- they listed: To make and enforce contracts; to sue, be parties, and give evidence; to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.

Maryland decided that henceforth American history and tradition are important to consider what rights are protected in this country. It's true that our friends overseas who have more or less civilized, free societies don't respect rights to the same level that we do. For example, England, which is a free society, has a monarchy. They have hereditary lords in parliament. They don't have First Amendment protection."

This is a highly statistical matter. Without incorporation, it's decided by State legislatures; with, it's decided by Federal judges. Now, think of this, too: That when you have the First Amendment, or some of the other amendments, there’s always a big area where it's free speech versus a whole lot of things, but not often free speech versus life. When it's free speech versus life, we very often decide in favor of life. Here every case will be on one side guns, on the other side human life. Statistics, balancing life versus guns. How are Federal judges in your opinion, rather than legislatures in the States in a Federal system -- how are Federal judges supposed to carry this out? I want to see where we’re going."

So New York Times v. Sullivan is the law of all 50 States, et cetera, et cetera. And I think that in a sense the virtue of that approach is probably even more apparent with the Second Amendment than it might be with some other jurisprudence --"

And so Glucksberg has its discussion about the standard for unenumerated rights, but it starts that off by saying of course the Bill of Rights are different. And, of course, the Bill of Rights, I think, as I read this Court's selective --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "They stand in a favored position, but we've never said had to be literally all the way down the line, or we couldn't have done the criminal jury -- nonunanimous criminal jury case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Again, though, it's interesting that the one place that I -- that I see where the Court has not effectively translated all the case law is one of the procedural rights, the Sixth Amendment criminal jury right. And I think with respect to the substantive rights -- and I think the alliance here or the similarity between the First and the Second Amendments are very stark in this respect -- this Court has incorporated essentially not just the amendment and not just the right, but all of the jurisprudence as well. And, you know, I would -- just to dwell for a moment if I'd could on the -- on the First and the Second Amendment, I think it's striking, very striking, that if this Court's not going to reconsider its Privileges or Immunities Clause jurisprudence, the Cruikshank case actually stands as very good precedent for incorporating the Second Amendment, just as it was the precedent this Court relied on in incorporating the assembly and petition rights of the First Amendment in the De Jonge case. And the reason is Cruikshank -- the whole reason that Cruikshank said the First and Second Amendments aren't privileges of national citizenship is because they were preexisting rights that didn't depend on the Constitution for their existence. That seems to me to be a pretty good working definition of what a fundamental right is, one that is so fundamental and basic that it preexisted our very Constitution. And so it's not surprising that De Jonge cited Cruikshank as favorable precedent for incorporation. I think the exact same logic would apply to the Second Amendment here, and, as I say, I do think the consequence of that, certainly the most logical consequence, would be to carry over the jurisprudence under the Second Amendment. Now, right now, that's not carrying over a lot, right? That's carrying over the Heller case. But I think in a way that points up to the fact that one of the virtues of incorporation is that, because the Miller decision of this Court sowed confusion, we don’t have substantial Second Amendment jurisprudence. And I would think that it's going to be difficult enough to develop the Second Amendment jurisprudence that you wouldn't want to make it more difficult by having to develop a Federal Second Amendment jurisprudence and then some sort of shadow version of that jurisprudence for the States. And I think in the more recent incorporation cases, this Court was quite candid that it wasn't going to adopt sort of a shadow version of the Federal guarantee or some watered-down version of the Federal guarantee, but it really saw the virtue of incorporating not just the right but the jurisprudence that came with that right. And so I do think that's in a sense something that counts in favor of incorporating the Second Amendment and doing so through the Due Process Clause, the same way this Court has dealt with the other substantive guarantees of the Bill of Rights. And I think if you apply that jurisprudence, the case really is very straightforward. In fact, I think if you compare the First Amendment and the Fourth Amendment to the Second Amendment, they have the same textual guarantee to the people, they trace their origins to preexisting rights back to the English Bill of Rights, back to even earlier constitutional history."

    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "That's true of the criminal jury trial right, too, all of those things? And yet we don't -- it's not exactly the same. I just don't see why it has to be exactly the same. I can understand your argument that it should be substantially the same, but I don't see that there's anything in the text of the Fourteenth Amendment that would justify saying it must be precisely the same, or of any of our cases."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "Well -- and, again, Justice Stevens, you know, since I think that -- that the incorporation clause is -- I mean, the incorporation jurisprudence is, to put it lightly, a gloss on the text of the Due Process Clause --"

  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "That's right. That's right, Justice Stevens. But I guess I would say is that, putting the Sixth Amendment to one side, which I think is a bit of an outlier in the jurisprudence here, I think the trend of all of this Court's incorporation jurisprudence has been more towards complete incorporation of the right and the jurisprudence. So -- I mean, Mapp is a perfect illustration."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "That still allows scope, once you determine that the right is incorporated, for recognizing that the States might have broader interests that the Federal Government doesn't have.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "CLEMENT",
    "speech": "That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think the same thing can be said for any other one of the other incorporated amendments. So I think the same thing might be true in the First Amendment. There are certainly going to be situations that the Federal government confronts that the State governments won't confront the exact analogue situation and vice versa. Now, you know, there may be unique issues about national parks that the States aren’t going to have to confront, and the jurisprudence can take that into account. But I think that's far different from saying that we really are going to have this shadow jurisprudence for one of the provisions. And I think, again, to go back to Mapp just as an illustration, when this Court first incorporated the Fourth Amendment and said, well, we’ll talk about the exclusionary rule later; maybe we won't incorporate the Fourth -- the exclusionary rule. We’ll just incorporate the Fourth Amendment's basic guarantee. And the trend of later cases was to say, no, kind of in for a penny, in for a pound --"

And the way that -- the way -- the way that the right might be incorporated in respect to that is light years different from the way it might be interpreted if you think what it is, is the right to have a gun to shoot a burglar. They’re just two separate things. And as to the first, it's pretty hard for me to see why you’d incorporate it, for reasons I won't go into. As to the second, I understand it. So we’re starting with a difference in purposes at the least. And shouldn't that make a difference in how you  incorporate?"

And I would simply finish by noting that the one thing that I think we can come to a conclusion about Blackstone is the very fact that Blackstone dwelled on the right is good evidence that it's a fundamental right that should apply to the States."

Firearms, unlike anything else that is the subject of a provision of the Bill of Rights, are designed to injure and kill.

As far as I know, no justice has ever disagreed with that -- with that ruling or suggested he was wrong in so ruling. From -- it was -- the only reason -- and when the Fourteenth Amendment was passed and ratified in the late 1860s, again, the -- the framers did not directly apply the Bill of Rights to the States.

I think -- the argument that I’m making is that States and local governments under the political process, which as far as we know, if the only issue had been self-defense, the framers would have been satisfied to leave this to the States and to leave this to the political process, and not to put it in the Constitution -- that -- that -- that as far as the right to self-defense goes, that’s something that has always been effectively regulated through the political process and especially at the State and local level.

It’s certainly relevant that in the last 220 years, no State has done that or even come close, and, in fact, as the briefs on the other side of the case from some of the States show, they are quite in the opposite direction.

But that --"
  },
  {

    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "I -- the Court would just say that what Heller held was if you look at the meanings that the words in the Second Amendment had, the common meaning -- as the Court said in the Heller opinion -- the common meanings that the word had in 1791, it imposed limitation on the state. It took a preexisting right that had not been -- it was not codified in the Constitution, and it said, this self-defense right we need in the Constitution in order -- in order to protect the militia against being disarmed by the Federal Government."

    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "Well, it's actually what the Court said in its opinion. What the Court said in its opinion is the reason it was codified was the concern that the framers had with the -- that the Federal Government might disarm the militia. Not self-defense.

But today --"

  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",

Perhaps the right to self-defense is, and then like other rights, similar rights, if the Court were to hold that that is constitutionally protected, the question would be is the State now giving you sufficient means to exercise that right? Not whatever means you want, but sufficient means so that you reasonably can exercise that right.

And he would say, insofar as that right to bear arms is important for the purpose of maintaining the militia, it's high on the ordered liberty chart. Insofar as the right to bear arms is there to shoot burglars, it's low on the ordered liberty chart. And if that's what they’d say, it's conceivable that part of this amendment would go through and be incorporated; namely, that part which would prevent a law that would disarm people to the extent they couldn't form militias. But that part which would disarm people to the extent that they couldn't shoot burglars, that would not be incorporated."

As far as today, it is true that 44 States have some kind of recognition of a right to keep and bear arms. Now, some of those States -- a couple of them, at least, two to four -- recognize that only in connection with the militia, and it's really quite different from the right that this Court recognized in Heller. Many other of the rights that are recognized in State constitutions include provisions that really would be unheard of, and that actually point to the reasons why this is not fundamental, like, say, freedom of speech or freedom of religion. They have provisions that say: Subject to such regulation as the legislature may prescribe, or the like. And that points out the other difference. Because firearms are -- the same features that make them useful for self-defense make them also useful as instruments of violent crime, suicide, and accidental death.

At or around that time, there are numerous States that had regulations barring the carrying and even that go up to the point of possession of pistols and Bowie knives, which are not firearms, but are also arms under the Second Amendment, and so on."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, all those may be perfectly valid today, or -- if the Court incorporates the Second Amendment. Incorporation doesn't say anything by itself about whether those types of regulations, which you think are reasonable and your friends think may not be reasonable, are valid or not."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "I think the Court in Heller did hold that a ban on -- a ban on handguns is invalid. That was the holding of the case. And these are -- these were laws that were passed that are very close to that. In the 1860s and the 1870s, in Texas, in these weapons from our jurisdiction. And they were generally upheld at that time. Now, those were responding to local conditions at the time, and generally, the history of firearms regulation, because of the risk that firearms pose, has been that in this country, it has been widely recognized that in many places it's appropriate to carry firearms. And many jurisdictions have found, and reasonably found, that allowing broad use, carriage, and whatever of firearms is appropriate, but there are some jurisdictions that have found that's not to be the case, throughout our history. And that has been a State and local decision that has worked through the political process in those jurisdictions. And that political process here is another distinction between the Second Amendment and some of the other amendments that have been incorporated -- is that one basis, I think, for incorporating the other amendments and for applying them against the States has been that there is a concern about a discrete minority or a highly unpopular view that’s not going to get a fair shake in the political process. I don't think that has ever been the case here. And as far as I know, the framers didn't think that was the case with respect to the right to keep and bear arms. It's a right that gets controlled in accordance with local conditions, with local cultures, and with local views about the necessarily difficult questions about how best to protect public safety. That is -- that has been a part of our -- of our history since 1860, since --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "But there -- but there are provisions of the Constitution, of the Bill of Rights, that have been incorporated against the States, where the States have substantial latitude and ample authority to impose reasonable regulations, rights respecting -- rights respecting property, the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. We look to see what the political process does. We look to see -- why can't we do the same thing with firearms?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "Well, it's just that the end -- I have really two points I’d like to make about that. One is the analysis the Court used in Heller. In Heller, what the Court said is: This is not the time to balance things; you cannot ban handguns. Now, there may be local -- there have been local jurisdictions before and there are now ones where they feel allowing some firearms, but banning handguns, is the best way to achieve public safety and to increase the zone of ordered liberty for their people. And those things would be apparently impermissible under Heller. But even more than that, Heller construed the Second Amendment's \"bear\" -- the word \"bear,\" \"to keep and bear arms\" -- to mean the same thing as \"carry\" in this Court's case in Muscarello, much later. And to carry -- generally to carry. Many -- there’s a long history of regulation of not just concealed carry, as the Court did recognize in Heller, but of banning open carry in a variety of jurisdictions. Again, generally, it's someplace that is -- it has a particular problem; it's a city or something like that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Do you think there is existing authority with reference to other provisions of the Bill of Rights that would allow us to incorporate just the core of Heller with respect to the States? Just the core of the Second Amendment with respect to the States, along the lines to this question Justice Stevens was asking earlier?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "Well, I think that there would be --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "And if so, what's -- what case do we look to for that proposition?"

  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "I think really this -- I cannot offhand think of a case that would lead you to that -- would lead to that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "If you look to Justice Harlan's dissent in Griswold, where he says the Fourteenth Amendment stands on its own bottom and it can be either more or less than the provisions of the Bill of Rights, and there’s no reason in the world why this Court could not adopt the same position here and say: Insofar it’s incorporated, it applies only within the home. The Court had ample precedent for that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "And actually the other point I make is if you approach it from the other point of view, the case has not been made here -- it hasn't even been brought -- that the City of Chicago is denying people the -- the right to have any kind of firearm or the right to have any kind of reasonable means of self-defense."

    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "No, what I would say is that --what I would say is that if the Court -- what I was saying is that if the Court approaches it from the standpoint of perhaps if there is -- if the Court chooses in an appropriate case to recognize a fundamental right to self-defense, it would then raise those kinds of questions. And someone could make the case that they are being denied any right to self-defense or any reasonable right to exercise self-defense because of a jurisdiction's firearms regulations; the Court could address that. That's not a claim that has been made in this case; that's not a claim that could be made in this case because --"
  },

    "speaker": "SCALIA",

    "speaker": "SCALIA",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "FELDMAN",
    "speech": "No, actually I -- I don't want to impose that on the States. I think it's very unlikely that the Court would ever be called upon to, because our history for the last 200 years -- 220 years had been of reasonable State and local regulation of firearms that responds to local conditions, to local threats of violence, and so on that occur. And I don't see any reason to think that there will be a jurisdiction that would try to sufficiently ban firearms that people wouldn't have a reasonable means of self-defense."

It shouldn't vary one way or the other with whether the same -- to the same extent under either the Privileges or Immunities Clause or the Due Process Clause.
