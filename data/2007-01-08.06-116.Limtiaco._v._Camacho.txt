1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:05 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus 5 Camacho. 6 Mr. Waxman. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 This case is properly before this Court, 12 which should reverse under the plain language and 13 purpose of the Organic Act of Guam. As to jurisdiction, 14 at the time Congress amended the Organic Act to replace 15 the certiorari jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit with 16 direct review in this Court, the Ninth Circuit had 17 already granted the writ of certiorari that had been 18 timely filed and the case had been briefed, argued and 19 submitted. The amendment said nothing about its 20 application to pending appeals, and someone had to 21 decide whether and how it applied to this case. The 22 Ninth Circuit was the proper body to do that, at least 23 in the first instance, and until it did, this case was 24 before that Court within the meaning of Gibbs versus 25 Wynn.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, I thought the 2 Ninth Circuit did decide that question in another case 3 that was pending, Santos. 4 MR. WAXMAN: It did decide it in Santos, 5 Justice Scalia. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wasn't that the time at 7 which it was clear that the Ninth Circuit no longer had 8 jurisdiction? 9 MR. WAXMAN: Well, for reasons that we 10 articulate, Your Honor, in a -- I forget the footnote 11 number, but a footnote in our brief, there are some 12 important distinctions, although they turned out not to 13 be dispositive, between the nature and position of this 14 case and Santos. 15 But in any event, we know from the Ninth 16 Circuit that it did not consider it otherwise, because 17 if the Court will refer to I believe it's page 50a or 18 51a of the joint appendix, after the Court decided 19 Santos, it sua sponte issued an order in this case -- it 20 is on page 51a -- resubmitting this case effective 21 February 1 to the Ninth Circuit's active consideration. 22 And shortly thereafter, it filed the order in this case 23 from that -- in our view, triggered the 2101(c) 90-day 24 period. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you suggesting that
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the test is whether under colorable jurisdiction -- a 2 hypothetical case, suppose the statute, Federal statute 3 is very clear that it applies in any case. Would your 4 argument be the same? 5 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I wouldn't have the most, 6 the strongest argument that I have in this case. I 7 think -- now, the Court's cases are not clear here but 8 it does seem to me that in the instance as here, where 9 it isn't just that a party has made some application or 10 filed a cert petition with a court, but the court has 11 actually reached out and asserted jurisdiction, surely 12 anything other than an amendment withdrawing -- that an 13 active withdrawing -- withdrawing jurisdiction that 14 requires anything other than merely a ministerial act, 15 where there can be no possible confusion about what 16 Congress intended to do, certainly anything short of 17 that, it lies with the Court to ascertain it. And here 18 -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if we accept that in 20 the opinion, what was the phrase you used, colorable 21 jurisdiction, or -- it's something I made up, I suppose 22 -- is there some concept that we can refer to or some 23 phrase that works to -- in order to incorporate your 24 test that you seem to be suggesting? 25 MR. WAXMAN: I actually would not embrace
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that test. I think that in an instance, Your Honor, 2 where a court in which, properly had jurisdiction and 3 affirmatively asserted it and issued -- and I can take 4 the Court through this -- a series of orders of the 5 Court, following this 19, the October 19, 2004 enactment 6 leading up to the decision in Santos and thereafter, 7 which the Court continued to rule, continued to issue 8 orders in this case, I think a good argument can be made 9 that on a theory of constitutional avoidance the court 10 ought to construe any enactment of Congress, no matter 11 how pellucid it is, as not constituting a self-effecting 12 reversal of a preexisting order of the Court in which 13 the case had been pending per order of the Court. 14 And so I'm not sure that I would even 15 embrace a ministerial test concept in the context in 16 which a case is properly pending in front of a court 17 which has affirmatively asserted jurisdiction over it. 18 And indeed here -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Waxman, may I just ask 20 this question? I don't understand what the import of 21 this order on page 51 is. I have it in front of me. 22 What did that do? Is it anything different immediately 23 after the order entered than -24 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. And I 25 think you should -- well, I suppose you could start
6

1 anywhere. But let's, maybe it would be as well to start 2 on 49a of the joint appendix. In December 15 -3 remember, the Guam Organic Act was amended I believe 4 October 30, 19 -- or 2004, and it was silent as to its 5 effect on cases that had already been filed and were 6 pending in the Ninth Circuit. 7 Sua sponte, the Court -- well, actually it 8 was not sua sponte. Almost two months after Congress 9 enacted the Organic Act, the respondent in this case, 10 Governor Camacho filed a motion on December 8 with the 11 Court renewing a previous motion for the Court to 12 expedite its resolution in this case. And Governor 13 Camacho's affidavit in support of that motion is 14 included in the joint appendix. 15 In response to the motion, not telling the 16 Court hey, by the way, it's been nice doing business 17 with you but we have no further truck with your court 18 because Congress passed the statute and you are ipso 19 facto by operation of law no longer in business, the 20 Ninth Circuit issued the order on page 49a that says no 21 opinion in this case can issue until the case of Santos 22 is decided clarifying our continuing certiorari 23 jurisdiction over decisions from the Guam Supreme Court. 24 Then turn to page 50a of the joint appendix. 25 A week later, on December 22, the Court sua sponte
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 issues an order withdrawing and deferring a ruling in 2 this case pending the decision in Santos. Santos is 3 then decided in January. And on February 1, the Court 4 issues an order in this pending case saying okay, it's 5 resubmitted to the panel. And shortly thereafter, the 6 panel issued the order dismissing this case for lack of 7 jurisdiction, and from that date we filed a timely 8 petition for certiorari. 9 Now the contention of the respondent in this 10 case that the attorney general should immediately upon 11 enactment of the Organic Act amendment have also filed a 12 petition with this Court would do one of two things. It 13 either would have put this Court in the position of 14 determining the effect of the amendment at the very same 15 time that the Ninth Circuit was doing so, which is a 16 state of affairs that this Court has repeatedly 17 rejected, most notably in Andrews versus Virginia 18 Railway, or it would have amounted to nothing more than 19 what this Court has called, quote, "the filing of a 20 redundant slip of paper." 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, am I wrong? I 22 thought that the Attorney General of Guam did file cert 23 in some cases that are pending, or am I wrong on that? 24 MR. WAXMAN: The attorney -- there were two 25 cases in which the Guam Supreme Court issued a final --
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 its own final ruling after the October 30, 2004 2 amendment of the Organic Act. And in that instance, the 3 Organic Act was in effect. He filed a petition for a 4 writ of certiorari in this Court. There were two cases 5 that were pending in the Ninth Circuit and over which 6 the Ninth Circuit had granted the writ, this case and 7 Santos. In Santos, but not in this case, the Court 8 asked the parties to file supplemental briefs with 9 respect to the Court's continued jurisdiction, and the 10 attorney general did so in this case, and it's discussed 11 in our reply brief. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, going back to 13 what you just said, isn't a third possibility, the most 14 likely possibility, that this Court would simply hold 15 the petition if there were -- if the attorney general 16 filed a cert petition here while the Ninth Circuit had 17 not yet disposed of the case, this Court could have just 18 held it because the Ninth Circuit was likely soon to 19 dispose of it. 20 MR. WAXMAN: Well, the attorney general 21 could have filed a petition for writ of certiorari 22 before judgment in this Court, you know, at any time 23 prior to the time that the Ninth Circuit issued its 24 order dismissing jurisdiction. 25 This Court has said uniformly outside the
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 special context of three-judge courts that it will not 2 require the mere filing of a redundant piece of paper, 3 to quote the Colville Indian Reservation case, and it 4 has declined to extend this well, why don't you just 5 file a notice of appeal. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no sense in 7 which it's redundant, though. It would have been the 8 first piece of paper that this Court would have seen in 9 the matter. 10 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. But that is actually what 11 this Court was referring to in the Colville Indian 12 Reservation case and other cases in calling it redundant 13 in the sense that it was identical or effectively 14 identical to a piece of paper that had invoked the 15 jurisdiction of another court at the same time. 16 In the three-judge court context, 17 Justice Ginsburg, although this Court's jurisdiction to 18 hear direct appeals in three-judge courts has been 19 greatly reduced since the 1950s and sixties and early 20 seventies, there are certain instances that this Court 21 has realized where it is unclear whether an appeal lies 22 to a regional court of appeals or to this Court and it 23 is unavoidable there that you would file a notice of 24 appeal in both instances; but this is not a situation in 25 which there was any uncertainty about where the petition
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 for a writ of certiorari from the Guam Supreme Court's 2 decision had to be filed. The Organic Act said the 3 Ninth Circuit had certiorari jurisdiction. The Ninth 4 Circuit granted the petition in this case and had 5 assumed authority over it, and so -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't it just the 7 case -- you've made several arguments, but you have a 8 case that's lodged in the court of appeals. It's not 9 simply a petition there. They have accepted it for 10 review. 11 MR. WAXMAN: Right. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So in the normal course 13 when you have a district court decision, a trial court 14 decision, then you're on appeal and the case is fully 15 lodged in the court of appeals, it's like the judgment 16 is suspended until the appellate court is done. So you 17 have no final judgment that is properly taken anyplace 18 else until that judgment is entered. I think that's the 19 essence of your argument, isn't it? 20 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, and in fact -- I mean, 21 it's -- I don't think that anything actually turns on 22 this in the context of this case, but it is quite 23 significant that at the time -- there has yet never been 24 any appellate determination of the substantive question 25 in this case. The Guam Supreme Court considered this as
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 a court of first instance that original petition was 2 filed in the Guam Supreme Court. 3 And the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals at 4 the time that the attorney general filed the petition 5 for a writ of certiorari was the only place the attorney 6 general of Guam could go to get review of this 7 construction by a territorial court sitting as a trial 8 court in the first instance of an act of Congress. 9 JUSTICE ALITO: Does it make any difference 10 that the review was discretionary in the Ninth Circuit? 11 What if before the act was passed there was an appeal as 12 of right to the Ninth Circuit? Wouldn't your argument 13 be exactly the same? 14 MR. WAXMAN: It would be exactly the same. 15 We just think that, given the fact that this is an 16 instance in which the Ninth Circuit granted the writ of 17 certiorari and issued both before -- both before the 18 amendment and after the amendment and both before Santos 19 and after Santos orders reflecting the fact that it 20 believed it continued to have authority over this case, 21 the appropriate outcome in this case is more 22 straightforward than it might be in some other closer 23 instances. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Perhaps you should go on 25 to the merits.

1 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And on that I have a 3 preliminary question, because we have a new attorney 4 general and the question is whether the new attorney 5 general continues to oppose the legislature and the 6 governor on this bond issue. Do -- in other words, do 7 we still have a case or controversy? 8 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we do. 9 I have spoken personally and repeatedly with the 10 attorney general, who is with me at counsel table, who 11 has instructed me unequivocally to continue vigorously 12 to advocate the construction of the Organic Act that 13 reflected in our petition and in our merits and reply 14 brief. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I have a more basic 16 question, whether we had a case or controversy to start 17 with. This is kind of an intramural dispute between two 18 Guamanian officials about what Guam's position should be 19 with respect to the Organic Act and I'm wondering why 20 that's a justiciable controversy under Article III. The 21 cases you cited in your petition all involved on its -22 only facially intra -- interbranch disputes within the 23 Federal Government; but the agencies in those cases 24 always -- were representing a real party in interest. 25 United States versus ICC, the ICC was actually the
13

1 railroad in whose favor the had commission ruled. Why 2 shouldn't we just let Guam figure out its position on 3 its own and then when a private party with standing 4 challenges something then we'll have a case or 5 controversy. 6 MR. WAXMAN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, this 7 is actually an a fortiori. If you don't agree with me 8 and you think that there really wasn't a case or 9 controversy, then we would respectfully submit the 10 appropriate resolution would be to dismiss and vacate 11 the Guam Supreme Court's decision so that the attorney 12 general -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no. Guam -14 presumably, some state courts issue advisory opinions. 15 We don't -- that's their business. It's just a question 16 of whether we have jurisdiction to address the question 17 in that context. 18 MR. WAXMAN: Indeed. But here's the 19 situation here, and this is why I think it's an a 20 fortiori case. The attorney general and the governor of 21 Guam are each separately elected. They each have 22 non-discretionary obligations under Guam law in addition 23 to their obligation to interpret and enforce the 24 Constitution and laws of the United States. The 25 attorney general cannot be removed by, by the governor,
14
Alderson Reporting Company

1 by Guam law, unlike the case in many of these Federal 2 executive branch intramural disputes; and she is 3 required by Guam law in any instance in which the 4 governor and the legislature attempt to borrow money 5 subject to the full faith and credit of the territory to 6 certify that such borrowing is lawful. And in this 7 instance, therefore, she is, as the unremovable elected 8 chief law enforcement of the territory, she is required 9 both to properly apply the Federal law that, the Organic 10 Act that constitutes Guam's constitution and Guam 11 territorial law which requires her affirmatively to 12 certify the legality of the proposed buy-in. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that she is 14 removable by election, and that is indeed what has 15 happened. And I understand that one of the issues in 16 the election was precisely whether this borrowing 17 authority existed or not. And if that's the case, you 18 have a new attorney general that presumably as an 19 original matter would not do what the prior attorney 20 general did. 21 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it is an intrabranch 23 dispute that can be resolved by the electorate 24 essentially. 25 MR. WAXMAN: There may very -- it may very
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 well occur. In fact, there either is or imminently will 2 be a proposed additional borrowing of $123 million 3 proposed by the governor to the legislature, and that is 4 going to require this attorney general to ascertain, 5 presumably prior to the time this Court -- well, I won't 6 presume, but perhaps before this Court renders a 7 decision in this case were it to, whether she can or 8 cannot certify that. 9 Now, the answer to that question will turn 10 in the first instance -- and she's not going to be 11 reelected before then. She can't be removed by the 12 governor before then. Her position is that if she 13 ascertains that in the form in which it's enacted that 14 proposed borrowing implicates, you know, constitutes 15 debt within the meaning of section 11, she will not sign 16 that legislation. 17 And that, it seems to me, during the 18 campaign -- of course, none of this is in the record -19 her position was that she would continue to pursue this 20 litigation in the Supreme Court, which is why she's 21 here. 22 JUSTICE SOUTER: I guess I'm not quite sure 23 what that means. I mean, it's one thing to say I will 24 pursue the litigation because it would be a good thing 25 to have a definitive answer from someone other than the
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 governor or me. Is it her position at the present time 2 that the position of her predecessor is correct or not? 3 MR. WAXMAN: It is her position that if she 4 were presented tomorrow with a borrowing that would 5 exceed the debt caps under the position of the attorney 6 general in this case, she will not sign it because that 7 constitutes her interpretation of the law. 8 JUSTICE SOUTER: So she adopts the 9 interpretation of her predecessor? 10 MR. WAXMAN: Correct. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: I have a question, if I 12 can, if we should reach the merits of the case -13 MR. WAXMAN: I think you should reach the 14 merits of the case. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: I know that. That isn't 16 it. I have a question about -- I have a question about 17 the merits. 18 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I have four reasons why 19 I think we are correct -20 JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but I have a 21 question I'd like you to go into. 22 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: I looked up, my law clerk 24 has, and found eight States that seem roughly 25 comparable. Those that go to assessed value, every
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 single one of them -- and most of them do -- they have 2 the word like "assessment. The only comparable places 3 we found are Puerto Rico, Philippines in 1916, and Guam 4 here which don't use the word "assessment," but use the 5 words "aggregate taxable value." 6 All right. Now, what's happened in those 7 places? We know what's happening in Guam. I can't -8 with the Philippines in 1916 and Puerto Rico, there 9 ought to be some experience there even if we couldn't 10 find a case how they treated it. 11 MR. WAXMAN: Well, they -- what's happening 12 in all those jurisdictions will certainly consume at 13 least the rest of the balance of my time. The simple 14 answer is that -- is the following. There are -15 looking first at the States, there are States that use 16 the term "the valuation." There are States that use 17 "the assessed valuation," "aggregate assessed 18 valuation," and there are a few States that use "tax 19 valuation." It is uniformly the case in the States and 20 elsewhere that the word "assessed" in this context is 21 understood to refer to the valuation against which the 22 property tax is based, whether that happens to be a 23 place where it is full value or a fractional value; but 24 it is also the case that at the time that the Guam 25 Supreme -- that the Guam Organic Act was enacted
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 fractional valuation was a commonplace for purposes of 2 assessing property tax. Now, in the territories -3 JUSTICE BREYER: Try Utah, try Iowa. Try -4 MR. WAXMAN: There were three States that we 5 discussed, Passy is one, Halsey is the other and I can't 6 remember the name of the other one, where they used -7 where the State constitution just said "aggregate 8 valuation" or "the valuation" and the State supreme 9 court said: There's no modifier for valuation; that 10 must mean full value. 11 There are, conversely, the State supreme 12 court in Fishburn in the Illinois context and in the 13 Indiana context where even that formulation, "the 14 valuation," the State supreme court said: Come on, it 15 is -- the debt limitation is always calculated -16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Waxman, can I ask you 17 this, just about Guam, not about the other territories. 18 Is there anything in the Organic Act that would prevent 19 Guam from changing the assessed percentage from 35 20 percent to 100 or 150? 21 MR. WAXMAN: Absolutely nothing. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So there's no, no limit in 23 the Organic Act of any real meaning? 24 MR. WAXMAN: That's -- the limit in the 25 Organic Act, and it makes it entirely consistent with
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 all of the other territories that I -- are not that many 2 and I will explicate -- which is the uniform rule has 3 been that the basis for valuation of property against 4 which the debt limitation percentage is multiplied is 5 the same as the valuation of property against which the 6 property taxes apply. And in the territories the 7 Congress has used essentially two formulations: In the 8 Springer Act it was "assessed value of taxable 9 property." In Alaska, it was "aggregate taxable value." 10 In Guam it's "aggregate tax valuation." In Hawaii, it 11 was "assessed value;" in the Northern Marianas, 12 "aggregate assessed valuation." 13 The Philippines, which you mentioned, is a 14 particularly instructive example because in 1902 and 15 1905 it was "assessed valuation," but then in 1916 and 16 1922, it was altered to be "aggregate tax valuation." 17 And then the Virgin -- Puerto Rico is "aggregate tax 18 valuation" and the virgin Islands, which we've 19 discussed, is "aggregate assessed valuation." 20 Now, the legislative histories of these 21 provisions, including the Guam provision, are lengthy, 22 obscure and frankly have been very difficult to obtain 23 because in many instances the hearings are unreported. 24 And we have been receiving the legislative history, 25 particularly the unpublished legislative histories, of
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 these provisions up to and including Saturday because in 2 the 11 days over the Christmas holiday in which we did 3 our reply brief we simply could not get hearing, 4 transcripts of hearings that were conducted in 1949 in 5 that Agana, Guam. 6 But we are prepared to lodge the relevant 7 provisions with the Court for the Court, and I don't 8 want to, therefore don't want to make any argument about 9 it, but I don't want to say that these words -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Please don't. 11 (Laughter.) 12 MR. WAXMAN: But the -13 JUSTICE BREYER: My question is the 14 following. In Puerto Rico and in the Philippines after 15 1916, and in Alaska, were there any instances in which 16 they issued bonds that exceeded the 10 percent of the 17 assessed value as opposed to the aggregate market value? 18 They either did or didn't and that shouldn't be hard to 19 find out. 20 MR. WAXMAN: I think that would be hard to 21 find out, and I don't know. I do know that there is 22 legislative history with respect to the use of the word 23 "assessed" and tax in this context both in Puerto Rico 24 and in the Philippines. I don't know about Alaska. 25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Just on the merits, the
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 first thing that the tax authorities have to do is they 2 have to value the property. 3 MR. WAXMAN: Correct. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And they're valuing it for 5 tax purposes, so that sounds like tax valuation. 6 MR. WAXMAN: I'm not -- our argument is that 7 the word "tax valuation" has to have meaning; and the 8 plainest meaning is the meaning, we respectfully submit, 9 the most natural meaning of "tax valuation" is the 10 valuation that is used by Guam for the calculation of 11 tax. 12 And that's true not only as a matter of 13 plain language, but for three other reasons. First of 14 all, as I indicated, it puts Guam in harmony with the 15 regime that has existed in every other U.S. territory in 16 which the value of property against which the debt 17 limitation rate is assessed is the same as the value of 18 property against which the tax rate is assessed. And 19 secondly, or thirdly, that fully accords with the 20 statutory and legislative history both with respect to 21 the territories and the states that reflects that it has 22 always been understood that tax valuation and assessed 23 valuation are equivalent in this context, and 24 understanding that furthers Congress's consistent goal 25 of restraining borrowing by territories.

1 And finally, interpreting tax to mean full 2 renders the word tax all but meaningless. I grant you, 3 Justice Kennedy, that it is possible to come up with a 4 meaning. It is not a meaning that the Guam Supreme 5 Court adopted but it is a possible meaning; but the Guam 6 Supreme Court interprets -- actually said in its 7 opinion, tax has to mean something. It interpreted tax 8 not to modify valuation, the word that follows it, but 9 to modify the word "property," and to read it as taxable 10 property, which is with all respect plainly wrong. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: There are big lenders in 12 the United States and those people don't fool around. 13 They get opinions. And they lend money to Puerto Rico 14 or they lend money to some of these places. They're 15 going to have opinion letters. And those opinion 16 letters are going to say whether they think in their 17 opinion this is over reaching to many bonds or not. And 18 Of course, I would think those opinion letters would say 19 for Puerto Rico, what the words aggregate tax valuation 20 mean. They might or might not. 21 In other words, I'm trying to find ways of 22 getting the tax. 23 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I don't have any such 24 opinion letters. And I would therefore, much like to 25 reserve at least a minute for rebuttal. But with
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 respect -2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now Mr. Waxman, 3 we've taken a fair amount of your time before you got to 4 the merits. So we'll give you a couple of minutes for 5 rebuttal. Why don't you answer that. 6 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you. 7 With respect to Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico 8 happens to be a situation which so far as we have been 9 able to ascertain, the law actually requires that for 10 purposes of determining valuation for application of the 11 tax rate, the assessed rate is required to be the actual 12 value, as is the case in the Virgin Islands. So that 13 distinction wouldn't exist. 14 On the other hand, in the Philippines, it is 15 clear from 1902 on that a system of fractional valuation 16 was in place. Now, getting -- figuring out what 17 actually happened in the Philippines way back when, when 18 it was a territory of the United States, has been 19 challenging and its may very well be that there is 20 information; but simply, simply obtaining for example, 21 the -- the three unpublished hearings with respect to 22 the Virgin Islands legislation in 1949 has been actually 23 surprisingly -- surprisingly challenging. If I may 24 reserve the balance of my time? 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

1 Mr. Waxman. Ms. Brinkmann? 2 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN, 3 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 4 MS. BRINKMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 5 it please the Court: 6 This case should be dismissed for want of 7 jurisdiction because the certiorari petition filed in 8 this Court to review the judgment of the Guam Supreme 9 Court was untimely. If the Court were nonetheless to 10 reach the merits of the opinion of the case, the opinion 11 of the Guam Supreme Court interpreting section 11 of the 12 Organic Act should be affirmed. 13 There are three principal reasons supporting 14 both of these positions. First, on the dismissal: 15 Dismissal is required, one, because when the Ninth 16 Circuit was divested of authority to adjudicate the 17 merits of the case, on October 30th, 2004, this Court 18 was then the only court that could review that judgment. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Brinkmann, Congress 20 sometimes withdraws jurisdictions from courts, but while 21 the case is spending it isn't until the court issues the 22 order -- there's no automatic dismissal of the case when 23 Congress passes an act. There is a case lodged in the 24 court, and that court will follow Congress's directions 25 and dismiss it. But until it does, its hold final

1 judgment. The judgment of the Guam Supreme Court is 2 suspended while it's sub judicata before the Ninth 3 Circuit, and then when the Ninth Circuit acts, then 4 there is a trigger. But until there isn't. 5 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, we respectfully 6 disagree. We don't believe that there was any 7 suspension of the time for filing once the Ninth Circuit 8 was divested of jurisdiction. This Court as long ago as 9 the Eisenberg case has recognized that the time for 10 filing certiorari is suspended so long as a lower court 11 has jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the case. 12 The Court reinforced that more recently -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if, what if you have 14 an ambiguous statute where it really is not clear 15 whether it applies to pending cases or not? What, what 16 -- you say if it turns out after the fact that it does 17 apply to pending cases, you are out of time, if you 18 haven't immediately filed here while the case is still 19 -- is still pending. 20 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, that is the 21 situation that the Court confronts in the three-judge 22 district court cases within in the instances in which 23 there was a mistake made as to where the appeal should 24 be taken. And the Court has jurisdiction to decide, the 25 jurisdiction in those instances has vacated and remanded

1 the order. 2 I want to emphasize to this Court that in 3 the Santos case, Petitioner requested that the Ninth 4 Circuit remand the order to the Guam Supreme Court, and 5 in the language of this Court, what that does is it 6 refreshes the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court so that 7 it can timely brought here. If Petitioner -8 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, would the Ninth 9 Circuit have had jurisdiction after October 30, 2004 to 10 vacate the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court and send 11 the case back? 12 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes. We believe under the 13 authority of this Court in those three-judge courts, 14 that is the solution that this Court has established -15 JUSTICE STEVENS: We did that. "We don't 16 have jurisdiction but we are nevertheless going to enter 17 the following order, which presumably depends on our 18 having jurisdiction, that the judgment is vacated," 19 assuming it's bad. You agree that the Ninth Circuit 20 could have done that? 21 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor. Petitioner 22 agreed that, he asked for that relief in the Santos 23 case. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that subject 25 to gamesmanship? Parties that are out of time in this
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Court going to a lower court and saying well, just 2 vacate and re-enter, and then I can start all over 3 again? We've discouraged that. 4 MS. BRINKMANN: We think not, Your Honor. 5 In the Donovan Ricky Richland case, the Court made clear 6 you would not vacate it when it was simply a failure to 7 obey the rules. The Court refused to vacate and remand 8 in that case, as we point out in our brief. This is a 9 case such as Justice Scalia was positing where there is 10 an actual issue of, colorable question of jurisdiction. 11 The proper course would to be to challenge, and here 12 Petitioner did not even try to litigate the question, 13 did not file any brief after Santos came down, never 14 tried to distinguish this case from Santos. He merely 15 waited and did not timely pursue the writ of the Guam 16 Supreme Court, the judgment that was final at that point 17 in time. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you'd say Santos, 19 then, is -- is -- is the Rubicon? Not the enactment of 20 the statute, but Santos? 21 MS. BRINKMANN: No we believe in this 22 particular instance, particularly on, with the clarity 23 under Brunner, of the divestiture of the Ninth Circuit 24 jurisdiction here. This is not a rule of force. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah. Your last argument,
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 then, is irrelevant. I mean if it's clear, it doesn't 2 matter what they did before. 3 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, I'm suggesting in 4 response to your question, Justice Scalia, that in those 5 other situations where there may be a question, that 6 does not put the Petitioner in a situation of not being 7 able to seek review. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is not this case. 9 MS. BRINKMANN: That's correct, Your Honor. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Ninth Circuit would 11 have been without authority to issue the orders in 12 Santos under your reasoning. The Ninth Circuit is 13 powerless because the authority had been transferred by 14 virtue of the statute to this Court, so the Ninth 15 Circuit was wrong in any orders it issued. 16 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, the Ninth 17 Circuit maintained jurisdiction to decide jurisdiction. 18 And indeed if Petitioner had litigated the question of 19 jurisdiction they could have brought a writ to the Ninth 20 Circuit and come to this Court and litigated the 21 question of jurisdiction. If the Court had found there 22 was jurisdiction it could have reached the merits. If 23 the Court had found it was not, there was no 24 jurisdiction, it would have -- in the three-judge courts 25 and said no, you need to come directly up from the Guam
29

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Supreme Court with vacate and remand for a fresh 2 judgment, and then you come to the Guam Supreme Court. 3 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, how much time 4 did the Petitioners have after the statute passed? 90 5 days? Or the interval of 90 days minus whatever had 6 been run? 7 MS. BRINKMANN: 90 days Your Honor. We 8 believe that the -9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why would that be so? 10 MS. BRINKMANN: The timely petition to the 11 Ninth Circuit and the grant of certiorari would have 12 suspended the finality of the Guam Supreme Court 13 judgment. Once Congress in its authority to demarcate 14 the jurisdictions of the lower Federal courts had passed 15 that the statute, it was no -- for no court to question 16 that, was divested jurisdiction at that time. The Guam 17 Supreme Court judgment was again final and it had 90 18 days to petition. 19 I should say there are other cases. 20 Eisenberg makes clear that time was not suspended when 21 the court below does not have jurisdiction. The Market 22 Street Railways case makes clear when as a matter of law 23 the lower court no longer can act on the case, the time 24 is no longer suspended. And the Jesse Oil case makes 25 clear that the party can not rely on a false exercise of
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 jurisdiction by the lower court. 2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in this case if it 3 was not a false exercise in Santos, why was it a false 4 exercise here? 5 MS. BRINKMANN: It was not a false exercise, 6 Your Honor, until October 30 of 2004. At that time 7 Congress spoke. And what that -8 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it, it, it was still an 9 exercise -- it was an exercise in this case of the same 10 authority that it was purporting to exercise in Santos, 11 which you conceded. And that is the authority to 12 determine its own jurisdiction. I presume that 13 jurisdiction is determined on a case by case basis when 14 a case has already been accepted by the Court, and as 15 Justice Ginsburg said is sub judice. So if there was, 16 if there was jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction in 17 Santos, I don't see why there wasn't likewise 18 jurisdiction to determine it here. 19 MS. BRINKMANN: There was jurisdiction, Your 20 Honor. Our position is the same in both of those cases. 21 And indeed if that issue of jurisdiction had been 22 litigated in this case, Petitioner could have brought a 23 writ to the Ninth Circuit judgment and litigated 24 jurisdiction in this case. But if the courts ultimately 25 determined that there was not jurisdiction, it had --
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Once the -- once the Ninth 2 Circuit determined that it had no longer a continuing 3 jurisdiction to do anything more than it did, in the 4 order that finally dismissed this, the other side wasn't 5 bound to litigate that here. 6 All the other side is saying is that up to 7 that point, the court was determining its own 8 jurisdiction. And therefore it is only when it 9 determined that its jurisdiction no longer existed, that 10 the filing period began to run. 11 So it seems to me that the crucial question 12 is if it could determine its own jurisdiction in Santos 13 which you concede, why can't it determine its own 14 jurisdiction here? 15 MS. BRINKMANN: It can, Your Honor, but -16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that what it was 17 doing? 18 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, but if it is found 19 there is no jurisdiction, then the party cannot have 20 relied on that to suspend -21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why can't it? 22 MS. BRINKMANN: Because this Court's cases 23 make clear, the Wynn, Eisenberg case -24 JUSTICE SOUTER: But those -- those -- are 25 they -- and you have got me here. The argument here is
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that the, that the Ninth Circuit already had taken 2 jurisdiction in this case. It wasn't a question of 3 whether to accept it or not. 4 MS. BRINKMANN: And in those cases, Your 5 Honor, the courts also -- appellate courts were 6 undoubtedly exercising jurisdiction in those cases. And 7 in Eisenberg, for example, it was a request to recall 8 the remittitur. It took months for the California 9 Supreme Court to decide that case. And they said yes, 10 there's a standard where you can do that there -- the 11 court. We find you don't make it, so we don't have 12 jurisdiction. They came to this Court and said out of 13 time. You had to have sought our review timely, from 14 the final judgment of the California Supreme Court, you 15 could not wait for that period of time in which the 16 California Supreme Court decided to not have 17 jurisdiction. 18 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -19 MS. BRINKMANN: That is a well established 20 Federal jurisdiction principle. 21 JUSTICE SOUTER: I guess I'm still at a loss 22 on the point that for one purpose, the purpose of the 23 90-day filing period, you're saying that the Ninth 24 Circuit did not have jurisdiction; but for another 25 purpose, the determination of whether it had
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 jurisdiction, you're saying it does have jurisdiction. 2 Am I misunderstanding your argument? 3 MS. BRINKMANN: I don't believe so. I think 4 that's very common -5 JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't see how you can 6 have it both ways. 7 MS. BRINKMANN: Well this Court has made 8 clear, for example, in the three-judge district court 9 cases, that this Court has jurisdiction when an appeal 10 comes before it, to decide whether or not it has 11 jurisdiction over that appeal. When parties have made 12 -13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe I should say I don't 14 know why this Court can have it both ways. 15 (Laughter.) 16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Don't, don't we have to 17 choose one analytical path or the other analytical path? 18 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, I think it 19 rests in this whole idea that courts have to have 20 jurisdiction to decide jurisdiction. But when you're -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then when they decide 22 they didn't have jurisdiction, then it's retroactive? 23 That's what your position is? 24 MS. BRINKMANN: No. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Ninth Circuit has
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 jurisdiction this whole time. But the day that it 2 issues its decision dismissing this case, then it is 3 retroactive back to the date that Congress passed the 4 statute? That's what you seem to be saying. 5 MS. BRINKMANN: The divestiture of the 6 jurisdiction occurred on the date that Congress's 7 statute went into effect. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: What if, what if the Ninth 9 Circuit had incorrectly held that it had jurisdiction? 10 Would it be the same? 11 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, that would have 12 been the scenario I discussed before, the parties could 13 have litigated that. If it came to this Court, and the 14 Court found there was jurisdiction, so be it. We think 15 it would have been a wrong ruling. And if it came to 16 this Court and this Court reversed, that is the scenario 17 we discussed, where in the three-judge district court 18 when that turns out, the court says we don't have 19 jurisdiction, you needed to come up through the other 20 route, we will dismiss, vacate and send back and come 21 up. 22 Now I have to urge on the Court there's a 23 purpose for that. In those cases the party is actively 24 believing and pursuing the view that jurisdiction 25 exists. In this case that was not the scenario.
35
Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But those cases really 2 are not on point. Because there was a vast confusion in 3 the days when there was a three-judge court, do I file a 4 jurisdictional statement, do I file a cert petition? 5 Sometimes this Court said we'll treat the jurisdictional 6 statement as a cert petition. But those existed from 7 the beginning. Here there's a case lodged in the Court 8 of Appeals, the Court of Appeals had every basis of 9 jurisdiction. This was no big shakes about it. It 10 wasn't, did they file the right paper? And then 11 Congress does something. And the Court would follow 12 suit. 13 It just seems to me very strange to say the 14 court has jurisdiction to decide whether it has 15 jurisdiction, but if it decides it doesn't, then the 16 date of that order is not the critical date, but you go 17 back to the date that Congress passed the law. 18 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, I think that 19 this Court addressed this scenario, and one of two 20 things could have happened. As you pointed out during 21 Petitioner's argument, it would have been an easy thing 22 to file a protective cert position. This Court is well 23 familiar, has recognized the appropriate of protective 24 filings -- certainly in the Federal habeas situation 25 where there are mixed petitions and we go back in
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 thought, protective filing within the 90-day period 2 would have been appropriate. And I urge, particularly 3 because Petitioner filed a brief within that period in 4 the Santos case, recognizing that Brunner required that 5 there was a divestiture of Ninth Circuit jurisdiction as 6 of the day of the statute enactment. 7 Even if there had not been that protective 8 filing, if Petitioner had a colorable jurisdiction 9 argument and litigated it, this Court has made clear 10 that once that has been determined adversely, there can 11 be a vacation and remand back to the Guam Supreme Court 12 so that judgment can be brought up. I would like to 13 turn to the merits if I could, Your Honor. 14 We believe that the well-reasoned opinion of 15 the Guam Supreme Court should be affirmed for three 16 reasons. First, the interpretation takes full account 17 of the text of the statute. As Justice Kennedy was 18 mentioning before, the purpose of this is to have a debt 19 limitation that is based on the property in Guam and the 20 tax valuation of that property in Guam. The tax 21 valuation is the valuation of the property that is 22 subject to tax. 23 This is not an original interpretation of 24 this provision. In the Superior Court opinion from 1989 25 that we attached to our brief in opposition, the Guam
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Supreme Court came to the same conclusion and 2 interpretation of this language. We think it is an 3 eminently reasonable and correct interpretation, 4 particularly in light of the absence of the word as set. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But don't you know 6 that your interpretation reads the word tax out of this 7 statute? I mean your position would be exactly the same 8 if it just said 10 percent of the value of the property 9 in Guam. 10 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor. That would 11 include the tax-exempt property. That would be a much 12 larger number. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: That's where I'm having 14 trouble on your side. I can't get very far with a 15 history of other places. Apparently I can't get there. 16 Tax doesn't seem to help me very much. So I 17 thought, well, one thing is clear. What they're trying 18 to do here is they take out of the box, if you look at 19 it, take all of the list of property that they don't 20 tax. I guess a school, maybe some tax exempt business 21 or something. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: Now their reason for doing 23 that must be that those people who they've exempted 24 entirely by statute are not going to be much help in 25 paying Guam. Well, if that's true, isn't precisely the
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 same thing true of the two-thirds of the property that 2 they don't take into account when they set their taxes? 3 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: Because? 5 MS. BRINKMANN: Because that property in 6 Guam is still securing this debt to a certain degree. 7 It is property that must be valued for tax purposes. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: No. It doesn't secure it 9 one bit if, in fact, the tax statute says you can't take 10 it into account when you set your taxes. Just as is 11 true of, let's say, a tax free business of some kind. 12 Now Guam doesn't have to do that, it could change its 13 statute, but so could it change its statute in respect 14 to a school, a university, or whatever the other things 15 are that are off those tax rolls. You know that, you 16 know, your answer was circular. That assumes that the 17 whole property is, but it isn't. 18 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, as a 19 matter of textual interpretation as to the tax valuation 20 of property in Guam, you look at the property in Guam 21 and then you have to take the tax valuation. You're 22 taking the property that is subject to tax. 23 We believe that this is the intent of 24 Congress also for two reasons, Justice Breyer, that 25 addressed your issues before about one suggestion that
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Guam could change this. The purpose of Congress here 2 was to set a meaningful debt limit. That is what real 3 value appraisal value does. It is an economic 4 determination of currency fact. 5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why why does it do 6 any more than the 35 percent value? That sets a 7 definite limit. 8 MS. BRINKMANN: Because that could be 9 changed at the whim of the legislature, Your Honor, and 10 the legislature could change that assessment to increase 11 the debt limit and -- while lowering taxes and altering 12 any tax liability. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With respect to much 14 of the tax exempt property, that could be changed by the 15 legislature as well. 16 MS. BRINKMANN: But when you're looking to a 17 bond debt limitation, you're looking at the bond market, 18 you're looking at investors, the certainty of an 19 appraisal value, actual real value, and -20 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't have to be 21 100 percent. They could change what you call the tax 22 valuation from 100 percent of the fair value to 150 23 percent. There's really much less to this case than 24 meets the eye. I mean, Guam is going to be able to 25 fiddle with this thing no matter how you come out.

1 MS. BRINKMANN: We don't believe that was 2 the intent of Congress. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, whether it was their 4 intent or not, is it not the case that Guam could say 5 all property will be valued at 150 percent of its fair 6 market value and we will then impose a 1 percent real 7 estate tax instead of the 2 percent, or instead of the 8 1.5 percent we had before? 9 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, they certainly could do 10 that as a matter of fact. We don't believe that should 11 alter the debt limitation Congress enacted, and that's 12 precisely why we believe that the Guam Supreme Court 13 opinion gives a meaningful interpretation of the purpose 14 of Congress and gives a real debt limitation that 15 exactly should be affirmed as exactly the purpose that 16 Congress intended. And that's why the assessed value 17 can be so easily manipulated, and is not a reasonable 18 interpretation. 19 I also would like to address 20 Justice Breyer's question about the -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, just before you go 22 there, if I were a bond investor, I would much prefer 23 issuing bonds if it's the lower value, if it's the 24 assessed value. I'm just more secure. 25 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, the uncertainty,
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 however, that the debt limitation is a real limitation 2 that serves the purpose of Congress in order to have 3 some kind of fiscal responsibility to the Territory is 4 what is furthered by the real limitation of having a 5 concrete appraisal full value as a basis for the 6 calculations. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you do have a 8 concrete appraisal, but it's just reduced to 35 percent. 9 MS. BRINKMANN: But that can be changed at 10 the whim of the legislature without any accountability 11 to the voters because at the same time that they change 12 the tax rate and not alter any tax liability. 13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say without any 14 responsibility to the voters. I mean, the voters are 15 going to know that if the valuation is changed and the 16 tax rate isn't, their taxes are going up. So I assume 17 the voters are going to be vigilant to what is going on 18 and I assume they have telephones and they'll call their 19 representatives. Why is this -- why do you posit this 20 sort of failure of representative democracy? 21 MS. BRINKMANN: Because I assume the tax 22 rate will be changed, so it's not just -- there's no -23 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if the tax rate is 24 changed, they're going to call twice. 25 MS. BRINKMANN: No. The tax rate will be
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 changed to be lower to maintain the same level, so there 2 would be no -- because the legislature isn't acting to 3 address any tax liability. They're simply asking to 4 manipulate the debt limitation, which is very contrary 5 to the purpose and any meaningful message that debt 6 limitation -7 JUSTICE SOUTER: But they're going to know 8 this. I mean, they're going to be, if they are 9 concerned at all about it, they'll be in touch with 10 their representatives. 11 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, of course the 12 bond issuance here also goes to the Guam legislature and 13 they are held accountable for that in the political 14 arena. I would suggest, Your Honor, the question 15 about -- I agree with petitioner's counsel about the 16 certainty of determining some of this historical 17 material is difficult and not precise. But we have gone 18 back and looked at the contemporaneous statutes in each 19 of these territorial jurisdictions, and as Mr. Waxman 20 pointed out, Puerto Rico it turns out actually uses the 21 actual value, all of them use the actual value. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do they tax on the basis 23 of the -24 MS. BRINKMANN: Yeah. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a fractional,
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 this 35 percent. In the other places, do they use as 2 the -- the value taxed 100 percent of the property -3 MS. BRINKMANN: Yeah. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and then just have a 5 lower tax rate? 6 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what was the 8 appraisal practice? I mean, in a lot of these 9 jurisdictions you have appraised value that turns out to 10 be 30 percent of the actual market value. 11 MS. BRINKMANN: But here, in the Virgin 12 Islands and Alaska, Federal law requires that the taxes 13 be imposed on the actual value. In the Virgin Islands 14 it said your assessment will be actual value. That's 15 why the term assessment was used in the Virgin Islands 16 debt limitation, because that was in a preexisting 17 Federal statute that required assessment be an actual 18 value. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Which one? You say they've 20 all used market values? 21 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, which of the ones 23 that use it have in fact an assessed value that is a 24 percentage of market value? 25 MS. BRINKMANN: None.

1 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, that 2 doesn't help us then. 3 MS. BRINKMANN: But I think it does further 4 the purpose of what Congress was looking to in both the 5 Virgin Islands and Alaska. The requirement for various 6 reasons that they impose their tax on the actual value 7 certainly supports the reasonableness of the 8 interpretation here, Your Honor. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, we could look at 10 Hawaii. In Hawaii they use the word assessed value. 11 They couldn't possibly have wanted it to be market 12 value, I wouldn't think. 13 MS. BRINKMANN: But the actual -14 JUSTICE BREYER: And in the District of 15 Columbia -- where are we on this? It's something else 16 in D.C. They use assessed value in the Virgin Islands. 17 MS. BRINKMANN: The preexisting law in 18 Hawaii before it became a territory had tax imposed on 19 the actual value, and subsequent to the debt limitation, 20 the territorial law also put it on actual value. 21 I would suggest, Your Honor, certainly if 22 there is any debate that there's more than one 23 interpretation of the Organic Act, that deference should 24 be afforded to the Guam Supreme Court's interpretation 25 of that. That is well established under this Court.

BRINKMANN: Most of the income and 10 revenue on Guam comes from the Federal income tax, 11 because unlike on the mainland, the Federal income tax 12 goes to the Guam Treasury rather than the United States 13 Treasury. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know that any 15 taxes from Guam are returned to Guam. Are additional 16 tax revenues given to Guam other than those that are 17 derived from Guam? 18 MS.

And we are not 12 suggesting that the Court affirm an erroneous 13 interpretation at all. This is a more than reasonable 14 interpretation of a theory, well reasoned opinion by the 15 Guam Supreme Court. The Guam Supreme Court has support, 16 it's 17-year old superior court opinion that had reached 17 the same conclusion. That was the only law out there 18 that Guamanians had looked to for the interpretation of 19 those provisions of the Organic Act. It predated the 20 1993 appraisal. And it took that opinion and did not 21 simply adopt it, but went through and did a very 22 detailed analysis of the test of the statute of the 23 Organic Act, the fact that it did not include the word 24 assessed, which was used 10 months later by Congress in 25 the Virgin Islands.

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: Miss Brinkmann, just to 2 follow up on Justice Scalia's question, is there any 3 history of the Federal government having to bail out the 4 Guam government for bankruptcy or anything close to 5 that? 6 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, none 7 whatsoever. 8 JUSTICE STEVENS: And is there anything in 9 the record that tells us what kind of a credit rating 10 Guam has? 11 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, I don't 12 believe it does. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did this value issue -- I 14 mean, was the borrowing effective given the controversy 15 between, the attorney general refused to sign, did that 16 have any consequences for whether this bond issue went 17 through? 18 MS. BRINKMANN: Absolutely, Your Honor. 19 Because of Petitioner's delay for more than a year and a 20 half in a court that did not have jurisdiction, these 21 bonds still have not been able to issue. And Petitioner 22 responded no. As a practical matter, the bond market 23 will not support issuance of these bonds until attempts 24 to undermine their validity have been brought to an end. 25 And so the Guam government has been doing different

1 means of financing in a positive manner. The economy of 2 Guam has returned because of many of the devastating 3 world events have taken, have passed in time, and the 4 economy is recovering. The U.S. military is returning 5 with a very large presence there. But they are still, 6 my understanding, approximately two years behind in 7 getting back tax returns. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In that case, you should 9 want us to exercise jurisdiction, decide it one way or 10 the other. 11 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, we believe that 12 it should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, the 13 Guam Supreme Court opinion stands, and we prevail under 14 that ruling, the Guam Supreme Court's interpretation of 15 Section 11 of the Organic Act. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you tell me whether 17 the rate of tax is uniform throughout Guam? The rate of 18 real estate tax. Is it an island-wide tax or is it 19 local, county? 20 MS. BRINKMANN: It is an island-wide tax, 21 Your Honor. Land is taxed at one-quarter of 1 percent 22 and improvements are taxed at 1 percent. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know why you just 24 didn't raise your assessed value from 30 percent to 100 25 percent and reduce the rate of tax accordingly.

1 MS. BRINKMANN: We don't believe that 2 Congress intended to inject itself into the workings of 3 this local territorial tax mechanism. The various 4 policies -5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you still have the 6 option, and I'm just dying to ask the question not 7 having anything to do with the case. Why did they do 8 this? Why did they have -- was it just to make 9 everybody feel good and they think they're ripping off 10 the government because they're getting only a 35 percent 11 value, even though everybody knows they'll just raise 12 the rate if it changes? 13 MS. BRINKMANN: That is exactly the kind of 14 policy decision that the local governing authority makes 15 about taxes. Actually the Petitioner has a footnote 16 explaining the origin of fractional tax valuation. 17 Indeed, it seems to be consistent with some of the 18 history also that we've seen that there would be 19 informal adjustments of valuations to take into account 20 perhaps poverty, or to take into account less 21 meritorious justifications. And the -- because of the 22 perception or, I believe petitioner calls it the 23 political psychology perhaps, of having such a high 24 rate, that is a policy decision that different taxing 25 authorities make.

1 It should not mean that Guam surrenders 2 two-thirds of its debt limitation. Congress did not use 3 the word assessed and it's a very difficult argument to 4 adopt that by failing to use assessed, they limited it 5 to an assessed value that surrendered two-thirds of the 6 Guam territorial debt limitation contrary to all -7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but you talked 8 about this as the deference we owe to the Guam Supreme 9 Court. This is a Federal statute, right? This was 10 passed by Congress. 11 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor, and in the 12 Santa Fe case versus Friday, with all due respect, 13 Petitioner is incorrect that that addressed territorial 14 laws. That was a provision in the New Mexico Organic 15 Act that fed up the jurisdiction of district courts that 16 Congress created in New Mexico. There was a provision 17 in that Organic Act provision of New Mexico that said 18 the jurisdiction of those courts was as limited as law. 19 That passage was interepreted in this Court 20 in Friday looking at another Federal statute and some 21 territorial laws. I would direct the Court to the 22 briefs in the case, that opinion itself was quite brief, 23 and when you look at the explications of the party, it 24 simply reinforces that the Court there was construing an 25 organic act, a Federal statue, and local territorial

1 statutes, and there directly said that they should defer 2 to the local understanding of the courts unless it is 3 clearly wrong. So we urge that that, too, should be -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does that apply to 5 all the provisions of the Organic Act? I mean, there 6 are provisions there addressing the jurisdictional issue 7 that we are considering here as well. Do we defer to 8 the Guam Supreme Court's view on that? 9 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, I see my time is 10 up, but if you'd like me to respond? 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's fine. 12 MS. BRINKMANN: I think that you could look 13 to your area of administrative deference, for example, 14 under Chevron, where you do also defer to the authority 15 of an agency, the interpretation of an agency. The 16 determination of its own authority the Court has upheld. 17 Thank you, Your Honor. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. 19 Brinkmann. 20 Mr. Waxman, we'll give you 3 minutes. 21 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 22 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 23 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 24 I want to direct the Court -- in response to 25 two questions that were asked of Ms. Brinkmann, I want
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to direct the court to two pages of the Guam Supreme 2 Court's opinion, and I'm going to summarize them for you 3 now, but for purposes of what's the difference between 4 in terms of bond holders, the fact that certain property 5 isn't taxed at all and certain property is only taxed at 6 35 percent, what's important to note here, and that is 7 reflected at page 26a of the petition appendix, the tax 8 roll on Guam includes a valuation of all nontaxable 9 property. The Guam Supreme Court then has to go back 10 and say, well, of this approximately 183 million is 11 exempt. So in Guam, the tax assessor and the Guam 12 courts are treating property that is wholly exempt from 13 taxation the same way that it treats the two-thirds of 14 fair market value that is exempt from application of the 15 tax rate. 16 Secondly, in response to Justice Kennedy's 17 questions about why are we focusing -- why wouldn't bond 18 holders focus on assessed valuation rather than the rest 19 and what difference does all of this make, page 18a of 20 the joint appendix, which is footnote 8 of the Guam 21 Supreme Court's opinion, which comes in the -- the 22 portion of the opinion where the court says, look, "tax" 23 has to mean something; we think it means taxable 24 property, not tax valuation. 25 The Guam Supreme Court in its opinion in
53

1 footnote 8, quoting from some language from a dissenting 2 opinion in the Hawaii Supreme Court, says as follows, 3 and I'm quoting from footnote 8: "It has been argued 4 that the use of a percentage of assessed value as a 5 measure of the State debt limit is without 6 significance," now skipping the rest of the sentence. 7 "The people that buy the bonds are interested in the 8 ratio of your debt to your assessed value because, while 9 all of the tax revenues of the State or the counties 10 naturally are available for the payment of the debt, 11 it's been customary for bond holders to look to the real 12 property tax as their collateral." 13 That is the authority on which the Guam 14 Supreme Court relied and it applies to this case and it 15 explain why the word "assessed" and the word "taxable" 16 have been construed synonymously and interchangeably in 17 the legislative history of these territorial statutes 18 and why assessed value is understood to be usually 19 fractional value for reasons of political psychology 20 that Ms. Brinkmann addressed, but even where it's full 21 value, it is only pursuant to a determination that for 22 assessment purposes full value should be used. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 24 The case is submitted. 25 (Whereupon, at 11:08 a.m., the case in the
