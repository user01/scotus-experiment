1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:09 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 this morning in Case 11-161, Armour v. City of 5 Indianapolis. 6 Mr. Stancil. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. STANCIL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 The city chose a method for abandoning its 12 sewer funding mechanism that left Petitioners paying 30 13 times more than their next-door neighbors to connect to 14 their neighborhood sewer project simply because 15 Petitioners had paid their tax bills in full. 16 Mere timing of payment does not render 17 similarly situated taxpayers into separate groups. And 18 that is particularly true here where the taxpayers are a 19 discretely defined group of homeowners sharing equally 20 in a common specific benefit and State law explicitly 21 defines them as similarly situated. 22 The city's principal contention is that 23 jettisoning the Barrett Law, the way they funded the 24 initial taxation, was itself an end for this 25 justification and itself justified the gross disparity

1 imposed on Petitioner -- on Petitioners. That does not. 2 The fact that an arbitrary classification may yield a 3 desirable result does not render it any less arbitrary. 4 The city must have a reason for drawing the distinction, 5 but paying one's taxes in good faith does not eliminate 6 a taxpayer's right to equal treatment. 7 Indeed, State law here makes clear that 8 delaying payment by choosing an installment plan does 9 not put a taxpayer on special footing. For example, the 10 Barrett Law declares that installment payments, quote, 11 "shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes." 12 And installment payments are automatically secured by a 13 lien against the property. 14 Taxpayers who select the installment plan, 15 which they may do for any reason or no reason 16 whatsoever -- and, in fact, if they make no choice, they 17 default into the installment plan. They are required, 18 if the city asks as it did here, to sign an agreement, 19 agreeing to pay the installments in full with interest 20 and not to contest the validity of the underlying 21 assessment. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I understand 23 your arguments. Your adversary raises a point that 24 concerns me, which is what happens to all other amnesty 25 programs like parking ticket amnesties? And if you take
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 your logic to an extreme, how about something that 2 doesn't involve money but immigration status amnesty, 3 illegal aliens who can apply for citizenship and be 4 forgiven their illegal entry? 5 Doesn't the logic of your theory basically 6 mean that there are no circumstances in which the 7 government could treat people differently? 8 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor, for several 9 reasons. For starters, this Court's equal protection 10 and rational basis cases in particular make clear that 11 context is key. So, forgiving a penalty imposed on a 12 speeder, for example, who has an overdue ticket or a 13 parking ticket is a qualitatively different judgment 14 than forgiving the underlying tax liability of a broad 15 swath of - 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Every time a police 17 officer stops me for a traffic violation, I get angry 18 when he lets somebody else go. So, you're suggesting 19 that there is a difference between that and this case 20 where the government is basically saying you owe me 21 something and I'm going to forgive you what you owe me? 22 MR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor. The Chief 23 Justice's opinion in Engquist took that specific example 24 on, not with you in mind presumably, but took that 25 example on specifically, and it said: This is the kind
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 of action itself that is inherently a subjective 2 individualized determination. It's not irrational to 3 pull over one traffic violator and not another because 4 that's the nature of -- of the enforcement action. That 5 is qualitatively different from a tax imposed on 181 6 homeowners who live next door to each other, and then 7 12 months later saying, you know, 31 of you are going to 8 pay 30 times as much in reality as the other 150, even 9 though - 10 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought there were a lot 11 more than -- there are 20 different lots, 20 12 different -- there are -- I mean, when -- what's your 13 view of -- of how the cutoff should work? Do they have 14 to refund all the money, everybody who, in fact, ever 15 paid a Barrett Law assessment? 16 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor, and State law 17 on this is quite clear. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't care what the State 19 is; I'm saying a matter of constitutional law. 20 MR. STANCIL: Well, constitutional law looks 21 to State law. That's what we took out of Allegheny 22 Pittsburgh and Nordlinger. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. All right. So what? 24 MR. STANCIL: But -- but I will back up. 25 I'll do it both ways, Your Honor. State law itself says
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the following taxpayers are similarly situated, your 2 project specific to your neighborhood, because those are 3 the people to whom you're guaranteed -- with whom you're 4 guaranteed equal treatment. It isn't that you're 5 entitled to a certain price for a sewer connection under 6 this law. It's - 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Why can the State, when 8 they have, let's say, 10,000 people who have already 9 paid their assessments -- well, why doesn't it have to 10 give them back their money, on your theory? That's my 11 simple question. 12 MR. STANCIL: Because they're not similarly 13 situated. Because - 14 JUSTICE BREYER: Why aren't they? 15 MR. STANCIL: Because your -- the States 16 have flexibility to define at the outset who is 17 similarly situated. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Fine. They define 19 here who is similarly situated, and the people who 20 aren't are the ones who are on the installment plan. 21 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor, but they still 22 have to have a basis for saying that. They don't - 23 JUSTICE BREYER: They do. They do. The 24 reason is because they think it's unfair to give the 25 people -- they think it's -- they don't want to bother
7

Alderson Reporting Company

1 collecting it from these people who haven't paid yet. 2 Okay? That's why. And they don't see a way, if you - 3 so, if we're going to free them, we don't want to go 4 back into history and then suddenly give back all the 5 people who've ever paid their assessment. I mean -- so, 6 we draw the line somewhere. 7 MR. STANCIL: Your Honor - 8 JUSTICE BREYER: This is where we're drawing 9 it. That's the State law. 10 MR. STANCIL: Well, that - 11 JUSTICE BREYER: What's wrong with that? 12 MR. STANCIL: That's not what this Court's 13 cases say. It's not the fact that you need to draw a 14 line somewhere. I'll take the case that Respondents 15 rely on heavily, FCC v. Beach - 16 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean -- my point, I'm not 17 making it clear. My point is that what's less rational 18 about saying, if you paid, too bad; we're having an 19 amnesty for the future? What's less rational about 20 doing that than saying some of the people who paid in 21 full will get their money back, and some will not? 22 Which is the line you want to draw. 23 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. Let me - 24 I'll back up again. So, we do have a specific 25 definition of who is and who is not entitled to equal
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 treatment or roughly equal treatment. So -- that's 2 under State law. So, they've already committed to who 3 is and who is not similarly situated. So, all you need 4 to decide in this case -- and this is brought as an 5 as-applied challenge by -- by these homeowners -- is: 6 Are these people who are promised you will pay the very 7 same as your next-door neighbor for this pipe that 8 you're going to flush your toilet into -- are they 9 allowed to then change their mind and say actually 10 you're going to pay 30 times as much? 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stancil, who are 12 "these people"? We have the plaintiffs in this suit, 13 and there's a judgment -- there was a judgment in the 14 court of first instance and the appellate court for a 15 dollar amount, but we're told that there are many more 16 of these Barrett Law projects and that they all operate 17 the same way. 18 So, the result is a lot more money than 19 these plaintiffs are claiming; is that not so? If your 20 position on the law is right. 21 MR. STANCIL: If we're -- if we are correct, 22 the city will end up paying a little more than in our 23 specific case, but I'd like to explain why and how much 24 because it's an important distinction. 25 There are about 21 Barrett Law projects that
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 still have balances outstanding. Many of them are 2 almost paid off. So, it -- in -- there are only three 3 that have the 30-year option. The rest have the 10-year 4 option. Anything from 2001 prior. So, in fact, I think 5 I can give you specific numbers. 6 There are seven projects that are less 7 than -- that are half paid off or about less than -- or 8 less than half paid off. Because the equal protection 9 violation is only triggered by gross disparity between 10 equally -- similarly situated taxpayers, the city may or 11 may not have to refund in each project down the line. 12 If you're in year 9 of 10 of repayment, that's not a - 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: That counts as a gross 14 disparity? 15 MR. STANCIL: If you're in year 9 of 10, I 16 don't think that counts as a gross disparity. 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: What does, is my question. 18 How -- how do you separate a gross disparity from a 19 non-gross disparity? 20 MR. STANCIL: Well, start with this case, 21 which is easy. It's 10 to 1 and 30 to 1. It's the same 22 number as in Allegheny Pittsburgh. But even if you drew 23 4 to 1 or 5 to 1 as a line, as the Court has done, say, 24 in punitive damages cases where it suggested outer 25 limits, that -- I think those are easy lines to draw and
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 certainly lines that the lower courts could draw. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if you win, does - 3 does the city just have to give you enough to bring it 4 down to 5 to 1 so that it's no longer a gross disparity? 5 MR. STANCIL: I don't think so, Your Honor. 6 I think triggering -- the gross disparity triggers the 7 violation. And the question is, well, what's the remedy 8 for a violation? I think they'd have to have a reason 9 for saying we're going to -- it would be the very 10 definition of arbitrary to say, well, even though you're 11 entitled to equal treatment as a matter of law, you 12 know, and even though we're not -- it's not -- liability 13 isn't triggered except for gross disparities, I think 14 they would have to give us that -- that figure. 15 And, Your Honor, if I could, I'd like to get 16 back, Justice Ginsburg, to your question about how these 17 other projects -- there's a suggestion by Respondents 18 that there's a terrible line-drawing problem in how do 19 we calculate these benefits. It's simply not the case. 20 We have this Federal class action in the Cox case, which 21 is every other Barrett Law project that's active except 22 ours. We opted out. 23 The damages question was before that court, 24 because -- because the court ruled in favor of the 25 position that this is an equal protection violation.
11

1 The city put together a damages pleading, and it -- and 2 it produced to the dollar a calculation of every 3 overpayment in every Barrett Law project. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: But that isn't the 5 administrative -- the administrative -- well, maybe 6 that's one of them. The administrative problem is, I 7 thought, the following: Imagine that you are the city 8 mayor. All right? And suppose the mayor does what you 9 want. The mayor says I'll give all these people in 10 their project back their money. 11 The next day in my office, there show up 15 12 people who say: Last month, we happened to be in 13 project 2, and we paid all our money. Why don't you 14 give us back our money? You just gave it to the people 15 in project 1. Give it to us. 16 And the next day after that, there are 14 17 people from project 3 and from project 4. What is your 18 answer to those angry taxpayers who have said we don't 19 understand why you refunded the money from project 1 but 20 not for us? 21 What's your answer? 22 MR. STANCIL: Two reasons. One, you were 23 not promised equal treatment under State law to those 24 other projects; you were promised equal treatment with 25 the people you live next door. Two, you use a different
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 pipe. These pipes cost different amounts of money to 2 put in different places, and they're done over time. 3 Your Honor's hypothetical -- actually, if I 4 could tweak it a little bit, it -- the question is not 5 who comes in for somebody -- who comes in from a project 6 last month. The only question is who comes in from a 7 project 11 or more years ago, because those are the only 8 ones that'll still be in repayment. 9 The Cox -- if we win -- well, there's a 10 repayment plan. That's the only thing that creates 11 this -- this asymmetry. The only people who are going 12 to come in and say, well, you refunded some people on my 13 project but not me are people in repayment. So, it's 14 only going to be from a project '95 - 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You see, the problem 16 that I have is that you're trying to lop off half of the 17 project, which is what was the Barrett project, without 18 looking at what the new project is. And that goes to 19 what Justice Breyer's point was. Moving forward, every 20 old project and every new project is going to pay more 21 money than they did under the Barrett Law because I 22 think, if I understand correctly, the city is raising 23 a -- essentially not a flat fee, but a fee, assessing a 24 flat fee across all taxpayers so that these sewer lines 25 can be built.
13

Alderson Reporting Company

1 Am I correct about that? 2 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. For future 3 sewer projects that they start, each person who connects 4 to that new pipe pays a $2,500 flat fee. Every resident 5 citywide who uses the municipal sewer -- new, old, or 6 whatever -- pays an extra about $10 a month under the 7 new system. So, what they did is they decided this 8 program, the Barrett Law, is politically very unpopular; 9 we would like to get rid of it. Fair enough. But they 10 chose a way to do it. They said well, we're going to be 11 completely ignorant of -- of the effects. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it -- but it says 13 that new people are going to pay a flat fee. Old people 14 are going to pay $10 more a month that they didn't have 15 to pay. 16 MR. STANCIL: Right. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so, why can't they 18 come in, and why don't they come in, and say exactly 19 what Justice Breyer said: You forgave the payments of 20 taxes for hooking up to the sewer system of these new 21 people coming in. You're treating me differently. 22 MR. STANCIL: There's -- there's nobody who 23 will pay more under the new system than my clients 24 because the new people pay $2,500 and the same monthly 25 fees that now every Indiana resident pays.
14

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, so, everybody else 2 says I want to pay $2,500. You're still not dealing 3 with the fact that this was one decision tied to others. 4 It was a package deal and -- so that the rationality of 5 this package deal has to be seen in context. You want 6 to lop it off and say all I'm looking at is how much 7 these taxpayers paid for this old system, not what the 8 new system is creating. 9 MR. STANCIL: But that's because, under this 10 Court's equal protection cases, they have to have a 11 reason for this particular line. They can't say we have 12 a general objective, and it doesn't matter if we pursue 13 it - 14 JUSTICE BREYER: I might have missed a fact, 15 which -- which I'd like to know. Let's call your 16 project, project 1, all right? And all the others are 2 17 through 20. Are there any people in projects 2 through 18 20 who still have money outstanding, or are they all 19 paid off? 20 MR. STANCIL: Yes. They have -- they're in 21 various states of repayment. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: They're in various states. 23 Okay. What happened to the taxpayers who still owe 24 money in projects 2 through 20? 25 MR. STANCIL: They all got refund -- or
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 their balances were completely forgiven. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, it's the same. 3 So, now the people for the angry taxpayers in projects 2 4 through 20 show up at the mayor and say, Mayor, you're 5 not only -- you only -- you're not only -- under your 6 system, you not only gave the all-paid-up people back, 7 if you win, but you also forgave the future people in 2 8 through 20, and you're not giving us our money back. 9 MR. STANCIL: Let me make clear, 2 through 10 20 are - 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Am I right on the facts? 12 MR. STANCIL: I'm not sure. I want to make 13 sure I understand that -- that fact. Two through 20 are 14 actually older projects - 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Older projects. 16 MR. STANCIL: Okay. So, they owe less 17 money, and they come into the mayor and they say: 18 Where's my money? I paid in full. I paid my - 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Right. 20 MR. STANCIL: -- 9,000, but Joe over here 21 got his last $1,000 forgiven. 22 Here's what the mayor says - 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 24 MR. STANCIL: The mayor says: I talked to 25 my lawyers. If it's a grossly disproportionate
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 burden -- so, if you end up paying grossly 2 disproportionately to your next-door neighbor, because 3 that's what Allegheny Pittsburgh and Nordlinger and all 4 the Court's cases say, then I'm entitled -- I have to 5 give you a refund. But, if you end up paying 10 percent 6 more than the other person to connect to this pipe, 7 that's just not an equal protection problem. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I see the - 9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stancil - 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think -- I think that 11 Justice Breyer is suggesting that if you treat 12 unconstitutionally a whole lot of people, you can get 13 away with it. 14 (Laughter.) 15 MR. STANCIL: Well - 16 JUSTICE BREYER: Oddly enough, I was not 17 suggesting that. 18 (Laughter.) 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, some - 20 some time ago, I thought you were just about to tell us 21 how much money the city says will be at stake if you 22 prevail. 23 MR. STANCIL: In my case, there's 24 $273,391.63. In the Cox case, $2,783,702.59, on the 25 assumption that all of those people are grossly
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 disproportionately burdened. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the -- the city 3 says that's the total amount that's at issue if you 4 prevail, if the taxpayers prevail on this claim. 5 MR. STANCIL: That's -- that's what they 6 said in Cox. Yes, Your Honor. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: Could the city cure the 8 problem by rescinding the forgiveness for those who paid 9 under the installment plan - 10 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: Why not? 12 MR. STANCIL: This was specifically 13 addressed in Allegheny Pittsburgh. That's exactly what 14 the West Virginia Supreme Court said. They said, well, 15 if you have any remedy, it's only to raise the taxes on 16 other people. And this Court specifically rejected 17 that. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: You wouldn't have any 19 incentive to bring a lawsuit if that were the remedy, 20 would you? 21 MR. STANCIL: Right. I'm already unpopular. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, effectively - 23 MR. STANCIL: I'm unpopular in Indianapolis 24 as it is. 25 (Laughter.)
18

Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. STANCIL: If I went back and just raised 2 everybody's taxes, I'll -- I'll never get to go. 3 (Laughter.) 4 MR. STANCIL: But, again, this -- and that's 5 just the practical reality. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't that a choice 7 for the legislature? Because everybody could be treated 8 equally by getting their money back, or nobody gets out 9 from under the old system. So, why shouldn't that be - 10 the decision is you can't treat these two groups of 11 people differently. So, I think the Court has said in a 12 number of cases you can equalize up or down. That is a 13 legislative choice. 14 MR. STANCIL: It was a legislative choice, 15 Justice Ginsburg, but having now made a choice that 16 inflicts a constitutional violation, this Court's cases 17 are clear, that the correct and the default rule is 18 refunds, because -- for exactly the reason 19 Justice Scalia raised. Even if it's possible to go back 20 and do that, which -- it isn't always the case, but even 21 if it's possible, that just means the equal protection 22 cases and tax cases don't get brought because the most 23 you can hope to get is - 24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stancil, if that's 25 right, and let's take a case which is different from the
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 one that -- that you're saying. Let's take a case where 2 there are many, many, many more open projects, involving 3 much, much more cost than you're saying is true here. 4 And the mayor looks at this and says: You know what? 5 Unless I can just draw the line here, I'm not going to 6 be able to change this financing system, either unless I 7 can draw the line here or unless I can say, you know, 8 nobody gets any money. 9 What's a mayor to do? 10 MR. STANCIL: Well, again, I agree with 11 Justice Scalia that making a big mess isn't a 12 justification for arbitrarily ending it. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but I -- I guess what 14 I'm asking is we have this terrible program; everybody 15 hates it; it's not fulfilling its intended purposes; the 16 mayor and everybody else wants to change it: How is the 17 mayor going to change this program now? 18 MR. STANCIL: There are two ways he could 19 have changed this program. One, he could have offered 20 us refunds. Two - 21 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm suggesting - 22 MR. STANCIL: I know - 23 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- that that is financially 24 prohibitive. 25 MR. STANCIL: I will pay for it then because
20

Alderson Reporting Company

1 he can go and he could -- he could have done two things 2 here. They could have -- and I'm using "the mayor" 3 loosely; it's actually the board of public works and the 4 city-county council. But he could have increased that 5 monthly fee under the new program. There actually - 6 these sewer projects still cost the same. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Have we ever decided an 8 equal protection case on the basis that the -- the State 9 who had violated the -- the Constitution can't afford to 10 pay for it? Is there any case that supports that? 11 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's just too expensive? 13 MR. STANCIL: No. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: And, therefore, we have to 15 deny equal protection? 16 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. And I - 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, isn't that what you're 18 saying, Mr. Stancil? Is what you're saying that when 19 cities create tax policy, they can't think about the 20 budget implications of that tax policy? 21 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. What I'm 22 saying is when they want to change tax policy, having 23 already said these taxpayers are the same and entitled 24 under law to equal treatment, they can't just say, well, 25 it would be too expensive on us to treat them equally

1 when unwinding that program. This Court in Plyler has 2 said resources are not sufficient. 3 And any tax case could be justified. If 4 the -- if the city says, well, you know, we want to 5 have -- we want to refund X dollars to our taxpayers, 6 but we only have enough to refund to the blonde people 7 and not to brunettes, that's arbitrary, even if they 8 couldn't afford to do it other ways -- another way. 9 So, they can't just pick a method that sort 10 of where the math works out or is convenient, and just 11 say, well, that's the way we could have done it. 12 I would, if I could, just return to the 13 practical ways they could have done this, And I think 14 that highlights just how arbitrary this line was. They 15 could have increased those monthly fees under STEP, the 16 new program. I mean, that's how they paid for the rest 17 of these projects. They're paying off the bonds of the 18 old projects by charging everybody in Indianapolis $10 19 more a month. 20 They could have just collected -- in our 21 project, they could have collected for 2 more years. 22 They could have said you'll be forgiven -- I think it's 23 about 27 months. You will -- we're going to forgive 24 your balances as of, you know, whatever that would be -25 June of 2010, whatever it would be, 2007 -- collected
22

Alderson Reporting Company

1 that money, and then they would have had the cash to 2 refund to the people who had paid in an equal amount 3 that they were forgiving to the others. So, I think -4 I think that's sort of -- it's a red herring to say, 5 gosh, we had no other way, or we only had these options 6 A, B, and C. 7 I'd like to -- I really want just to drill 8 down on the illustration of just how crazy I think this 9 is. Suppose that the United States decides tomorrow to 10 go to a national sales tax instead of the Federal income 11 tax. It's February 29th; millions of people have paid 12 their taxes for 2011; many, many -- most of us have not 13 yet paid. Could the IRS come in and say: Well, if 14 you've already filed and paid your taxes for 2011, too 15 bad. But lucky you, if you're a late filer; you're 16 going to get your entire tax bill forgiven. 17 I don't think that's remotely close. I 18 think that is arbitrary, and I'll give you a couple of 19 reasons. One, absolutely no notice. So, the timing of 20 payment, the method of payment that was selected, gives 21 those taxpayers absolutely no notice as to some 22 constitutional significance that attaches to it. 23 And I don't think -- and I can tell you from 24 talking to my clients, they don't -- they didn't think 25 that by paying up front in full that they had -- they

1 were somehow sacrificing their chance to equal treatment 2 or that the city might some day wipe out 97 percent of 3 their neighbors' tax obligations. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That is the parking 5 amnesty example that you have said wasn't the same. 6 Because if an individual taxpayer has filed late, it's 7 like the parking guy who didn't file his ticket, either. 8 MR. STANCIL: Well - 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, you really are 10 saying that amnesty programs are out of the question if 11 the risk is imposed equally on everyone. 12 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. In the 13 parking ticket example, forgiving a penalty for late 14 payment is a qualitatively different -- to borrow from 15 Engquist again, a subjectively individualized 16 determination designed to achieve another goal, a 17 legitimate goal in itself. Pay your parking ticket, and 18 we'll let the penalty go. That is different. 19 So, if my clients were here saying, well, 20 you're not charging me - 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but you're saying if 22 you forgive the parking ticket, that's an equal 23 protection violation. 24 MR. STANCIL: No, Your -- I mean, I would 25 not, Your Honor. Again, it's context-driven. The

1 parking - 2 JUSTICE BREYER: The goal here is very 3 simple. They say we have hundreds or dozens or 20 4 different programs anyway, and once we start getting 5 into the business of distinguishing among people who are 6 already paid up, it's going to be a nightmare. And so, 7 the only clear line we draw is between the people who 8 are already paid up and the people who haven't paid. 9 And we don't want those people who haven't paid to have 10 to pay because that's going to be another 20 years of 11 administrating $33 a month. 12 Okay. That's their rationale. Now, that 13 may not be perfect, but it sounds reasonable, doesn't 14 it? What's wrong with it? 15 MR. STANCIL: It's not, Your Honor. And 16 I'll say it rests on the faulty - 17 JUSTICE BREYER: It's not their rationale, 18 or it's not perfect? 19 MR. STANCIL: It's not reasonable, Your 20 Honor. It rests on the faulty premise that this is some 21 administratively - 22 JUSTICE BREYER: It's not impossible. They 23 don't say it's impossible. Say, try looking through the 24 U.S. tax code. It has thousands of pages. There is not 25 one human being alive who understands every provision.

1 All we have to do is start comparing the provision on 2 page 1 with page 3 with page 7 and page 9, and we will 3 discover irrationality forever. 4 So, I don't -- I mean, you may have this 5 fairly simple case, but I foresee, if you win, the - 6 don't ask me what will happen, but I have a suspicion 7 it's not going to be too good. 8 MR. STANCIL: Your Honor, I mean -- there's 9 one -- there's somebody not here in this case that I 10 think belies this notion - 11 JUSTICE BREYER: What? 12 MR. STANCIL: -- that this is going against 13 the tax code broadly or amnesty programs or forgiveness 14 decisions generally. If -- if -- I think if people 15 really thought that this case was going to foul up the 16 tax code or forgiveness, I think the IRS would be here 17 or the United States would be here saying this is very 18 similar to what we do on a daily basis in compromising 19 debt on an individual basis. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there an easier 21 thing to administer than the system that was struck down 22 in Allegheny Pittsburgh? 23 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Whatever you paid, 25 that's what your assessment was. And they argued, well,
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 this is easy; that's enough. And this Court said, no, 2 it's an equal protection violation. 3 MR. STANCIL: Correct, Your Honor, and, 4 again, the administrative burden there was actually 5 quite significant. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't believe in the 7 administrative nightmare exception to the Equal 8 Protection Clause? 9 (Laughter.) 10 MR. STANCIL: Not when it takes only three 11 pages and - 12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me -- I'm 13 curious to know, if other States have provisions like 14 the Barrett Law and they're concerned about this, can 15 they provide in the initial documents a -- a promise 16 that there will be no forgiveness, so that there would 17 be a contract clause sort of argument against what 18 happened here? In other words -- and if we could 19 explore that for just a minute, I'm going to ask what it 20 is that you thought constituted a promise in this case. 21 MR. STANCIL: Well, there are four - 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And maybe not a promise in 23 the contract sense. 24 MR. STANCIL: Yes. Four separate provisions 25 of the Barrett Law -- just -- I'll rattle them off for
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 you. First, it says installment payments shall be 2 collected in the same manner as other taxes. It 3 actually says "shall collect" two other times. Requires 4 a lien. It says that municipal officials who don't 5 collect installment payments can actually be held 6 personally liable and removed from office for failing to 7 discharge their duties. That's on pages 2a to 3a of the 8 appendix to the blue brief. 9 So, I don't think there's any sensible way 10 to read the Barrett Law as saying it doesn't require 11 payment. And none of the State court judges who've 12 looked at this have suggested that. And - 13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: On the other aspect of my 14 case, do you think other States could provide protection 15 against this, in the event you do not prevail here, and 16 -- and put in the documents that it is understood that a 17 condition for your approving of this, these sewers, will 18 be that there will be no forgiveness? 19 MR. STANCIL: I suppose they could, Your 20 Honor. I -- again I'd argue that - 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would that then be 22 enforceable under the contract clause, do you think? 23 MR. STANCIL: I'm not sure it would be 24 under the contract clause. But could I flip it and 25 suggest that if a State wanted to preserve its right to
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 forgive willy-nilly, they could include a provision in 2 their law that says, by the way, if you choose an 3 installment plan and we change our policy, there shall 4 be -- you're not entitled to equal treatment with people 5 who pay up front? 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Give you a warning? 7 MR. STANCIL: Right. And let's -- we'll see 8 who pays up front under that system. 9 (Laughter.) 10 MR. STANCIL: If I can, Your Honor -- if I 11 can, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 13 Mr. Stancil. 14 Mr. Clement. 15 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 16 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 17 MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 18 and may it please the Court: 19 In 2005, the City of -- the City of 20 Indianapolis decided that it wanted to abandon its 21 reliance on the Barrett Law, a program that had proved 22 unpopular for financing public improvements. In doing 23 so, they decided to make a clean break and forgive the 24 outstanding balances that were due under the Barrett Law 25 program. The alternative of maintaining those accounts
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 and maintaining the tax liens associated with those 2 accounts for nearly three decades was particularly 3 unattractive. Now, the - 4 JUSTICE ALITO: I think you've put your 5 finger on the reason for this, which is that the city 6 calculated that what it did would be more politically 7 acceptable than treating the people who paid up front 8 equally on an economic basis with the people who paid in 9 installment plans. Now, if that's the reason for this, 10 is that rational? 11 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Alito, it -- it 12 might well be rational. I mean, sometimes things that 13 make policy sense that the public likes also make good 14 government sense. And in this context, what they wanted 15 to do is they wanted to get out of the Barrett Law 16 business. That's the exact words - 17 JUSTICE ALITO: But what does that mean, 18 they wanted to get out of the Barrett Law business? 19 MR. CLEMENT: Can I put it very concretely? 20 I mean, before this -- you know, when they used to have 21 the Barrett Law and used it on an ongoing basis, within 22 the controller's office, they had a Barrett Law office. 23 They wanted to get rid of the Barrett Law office. 24 How do you get rid of the Barrett Law 25 office? You get of the obligation to continue to
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 collect these payments for 30 years; you get rid of the 2 obligations to keep all these files together and see 3 whether you're in a position to enforce a tax lien. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: That really doesn't seem 5 very complicated, to collect payments that people have 6 agreed to pay. And if they didn't want to do it 7 anymore, I bet they could have contracted that out for a 8 very modest fee to any number of private entities that 9 would have done it for them. 10 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Alito, of 11 course, they could have continued to collect. I think 12 that's common ground here, which I think ultimately 13 shows why this is a very curious equal protection 14 theory, because if the city would have continued to 15 collect these, you know, for 30 years, then they agree, 16 there's no Equal Protection Clause problem at all. 17 Now, I think as Justice Kagan was 18 suggesting, if you now create a rule that says when they 19 do forgive, they actually have to provide refunds and 20 face Equal Protection Clause violations, then in the 21 future, nobody is going to ever forgive. What they're 22 going to do in the future is, even though they're trying 23 to move away from this policy, even though they're 24 trying to get out of the Barrett Law business, they're 25 going to be stuck.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, I think maybe if you 2 prevail in this opinion, we should say the principle we 3 are adopting in this case is: Don't trust the 4 government. 5 MR. CLEMENT: No, Justice Kennedy, I don't 6 think that's right. But the fact that that's your 7 reaction I think shows that this is not really an equal 8 protection claim, and it's not really like Allegheny 9 Pittsburgh because, as your colloquy with Mr. Stancil 10 suggested, they would admit that if the government said, 11 as part of the Barrett Law, look, you know, we reserve 12 the right to abandon the Barrett Law, and if we do so, 13 we -- you know, we may forgive installment payments - 14 if they said that, the equal protection claim would go 15 away in their view. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's simply 17 because, as we said in Allegheny Pittsburgh, the basis 18 for considering the equal protection claim is the rights 19 that you're given under State law. In Allegheny 20 Pittsburgh, it says you have the right to be treated 21 equally with respect to assessments. And you weren't. 22 Here the law says you have the right to be 23 treated equally, or whatever it is, the apportionment, 24 and they weren't. All that you're saying there is that 25 State law gets to set the base. And if the State law
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 says we don't treat people the same in extending sewer 2 hook-ups, then that takes away your Equal Protection 3 Clause. But it just sets the base. 4 MR. CLEMENT: Two differences, 5 Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, you know, there's 6 no -- there's no real analogue to Allegheny Pittsburgh 7 because Allegheny Pittsburgh is a one time in time case. 8 There the problem was that statute was very different. 9 It was facially neutral, and it was being applied in an 10 unequal way. 11 Nothing, not one word, in Allegheny 12 Pittsburgh suggests that if the State of West Virginia 13 wanted to change its policy and adopt proposition 13 as 14 the law of West Virginia, that it couldn't do so. And 15 that's the anomaly here. This equal -- this equal 16 treatment requirement they get, they get it from the 17 Barrett Law. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The change in 19 policy - 20 MR. CLEMENT: That's the exact law that - 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The change in 22 policy is from treating people equally to treating 23 people unequally. I don't see how the fact that they're 24 changing that policy addresses the issue at all. 25 They're going from a system where everybody was subject
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to the same assessment to a system where some pay 2 something and other people pay 30 times that. Yes, it's 3 a change, but it's the change that presents the problem. 4 MR. CLEMENT: No, I -- with respect, I think 5 it's the change that makes this case different from 6 Allegheny Pittsburgh. It's the change that makes this 7 government action rational. 8 This would be a different case if they 9 didn't change the Barrett Law program, and they just 10 stuck by it and said, you know, we're going to forgive 11 some people. But here they decide they're going to - 12 they're going to abandon the very law that imposes, 13 supposedly -- I want to talk about what State law really 14 does. But it supposedly imposes this equal protection 15 requirement. That's the very law they want to move away 16 from. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I still don't - 18 MR. CLEMENT: And this idea that - 19 JUSTICE ALITO: Other than political 20 expediency and administrative convenience, I still don't 21 understand what rational basis you claim there was for 22 the distinction that was drawn. Now, maybe one of those 23 is sufficient, but other than those two possible bases, 24 I don't see another one. 25 MR. CLEMENT: Well, you know, I count five,
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Justice Alito. If you want to hear -- I mean, I'll go 2 through them. One is what I call making a clean break, 3 having not to deal with the vestiges of the old program. 4 You may call it political expedience. I don't think it 5 is. I think that's, you know, a good government 6 concern. 7 The second is avoiding the administrative 8 burdens of particularly the refund process. And I think 9 it's worth recognizing that -- you know, they say, well, 10 what could be simpler; just cut a check. But to whom 11 and for what amount? I mean, you know, if you're going 12 to go back to close accounts, the first thing you're 13 going to have to confront is what do we do with the 14 people that have sold their house? 15 Well, I mean, you know, we've got to figure 16 out where they are now. We've got to figure out, I 17 mean, do we - 18 JUSTICE ALITO: Those are reasons for not 19 giving refunds, but what are the reasons for forgiving 20 the debt that people agreed to? 21 MR. CLEMENT: Well -- okay. But, if I 22 could, they don't challenge the forgiveness. So, the 23 reason that I'm trying to explain that there are 24 rational bases for not giving refunds is because the 25 challenge that's really brought here is to Resolution
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 101, and it's - 2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you don't -- you 3 don't - 4 MR. CLEMENT: -- it's forgiveness without 5 refunds. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't dispute that the 7 city would have that option if we rule against you. 8 MR. CLEMENT: Would have the option what, 9 Mr. Justice Kennedy? 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just not to forgive the 11 unpaid balances. The city has the option, I assume. 12 MR. CLEMENT: They certainly have the option 13 in the future. I think it's a dispute between the 14 parties whether they have the option as a part of the 15 remedy. I would say, not to get ahead of myself, but to 16 address the remedy, this is very different from 17 Allegheny Pittsburgh. And it has to be that one option 18 is to simply invalidate Resolution 101. 19 I'm not -- I don't -- I'm not aware of any 20 other area of the law where you can have a statute or an 21 ordinance that draws an invalid distinction, and one 22 remedial option is not to invalidate the statute or the 23 ordinance. And that's the position. 24 Their position is, you know, if you would 25 have put something in there that said we're not going to
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 do anything, you'd be fine. But having given 2 forgiveness and said we're not going to give refunds, 3 you're stuck not only with the forgiveness but also with 4 giving refunds. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's a -- that's a big 6 difference. In one case, there's an expectation; in the 7 other case, there isn't. 8 MR. CLEMENT: No, Mr. Justice Kennedy, 9 because the expectation here is at the time of 10 Resolution 101. At the time of Resolution 101, I think 11 it's common ground. The city was under no obligation to 12 provide forgiveness. 13 So, if in 101, by providing forgiveness 14 without refunds, they violated the Equal Protection 15 Clause, why isn't the logical remedy for that to simply 16 invalidate Resolution 101? No forgiveness; everybody 17 gets equal treatment. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because you would -- you 19 would eliminate all litigation on Equal Protection 20 Clause grounds if all that the plaintiff is going to 21 achieve is not any benefit to him but harming somebody 22 else. 23 That's -- the classic case is -- is the sex 24 discrimination case, where a State had a drinking law 25 which said that -- that men could drink at the age of 18
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 but women at the age of 21. And what happened in the 2 lawsuit? Did the court say, well, I guess -- I guess 3 men will be able to drink at 18. No, that's - 4 MR. CLEMENT: No, I think what they said - 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: They said men would have to 6 drink at 18, not that women will have to wait to 21 7 because - 8 MR. CLEMENT: No, I think they said that 9 was, with respect - 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They said it could go 11 either way. 12 MR. CLEMENT: Exactly. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was up to the Oklahoma 14 legislature. They could make it 21 for everyone or 18 15 for everyone. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the city retains 17 that option in this case going forward. The problem 18 with - 19 MR. CLEMENT: No, but - 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- your analogy is 21 you're dealing with a situation -- you're saying, well, 22 here's a violation and the law can -- and what does the 23 law do? But this -- this is exactly 180 degrees away. 24 There's no violation, and the law creates the violation. 25 In that situation -
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. CLEMENT: Right. So, then you - 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- I think you're 3 dealing with an entirely different case. 4 MR. CLEMENT: If the law that created the 5 violation is Resolution 101, than the remedy in every 6 other area of constitutional law, including sex 7 discrimination, is clearly that the State has the 8 option. They can level up or they can level down. The 9 only case that's different is Allegheny Pittsburgh and 10 the assessment cases it relies on. But there's an 11 important difference. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Then you're saying that the 13 difference between the two classes is that if you 14 continue to have the tax apply to the people who haven't 15 paid it yet, there is a large administrative expense. 16 And if you -- as an expense that does not exist in 17 respect to the class that has already paid it. 18 So, the question, I would have thought, in 19 our Court is whether that's a rational distinction. And 20 I think contrary to what was suggested, administrative 21 expenses, of course, make a difference where the Equal 22 Protection Clause is concerned because they 23 differentiate between the two classes. And trying to 24 avoid an administrative expense is a rational reason, 25 normally, for making the distinction.

1 Now, I mention that because I know -- what 2 -- it can -- does that bring to mind any authority which 3 would be helpful? Because there was a question that 4 there is no such authority. It makes sense to me, but 5 is there some authority for that? 6 MR. CLEMENT: Sure, there is, Your Honor. I 7 mean, you look to a number of places. I would look to 8 Carmichael v. Southern Coal where, you know, this Court 9 is confronting a case where the State says, you know, 10 we're not going to tax employers -- employers who are 11 smaller than eight, because, you know, the game is not 12 worth the candle. And in a similar way here, they say 13 we want to get out of the Barrett Law business. We want 14 to make a clean break. And they say, you know, we don't 15 want to keep this office in the controller's office. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: But here -- here the State 17 has defined the class. That's the difference. I mean, 18 to say employers with less than eight is a separate 19 class, that's fine. But -- but here, the State said 20 we're creating this class of -- of people who have to 21 pay for sewer assessments, and we're going to treat them 22 equally. That's what the law required. 23 MR. CLEMENT: I would have thought, Justice 24 Scalia, if this was an equal protection case, not a 25 contracts case, not a Winstar case, not an estoppel
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 case, if this was an equal protection case, the relevant 2 time period would be the time period of the ordinance 3 that's challenged, Resolution 101. At that time, there 4 is a difference already in real-world fact between those 5 who've paid in full and those who have outstanding 6 balance, and are going to keep the city in the Barrett 7 Law business for three decades. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you're saying that any 9 future law which -- which disregards an equal 10 classification that a prior law established is okay? So 11 long as it's a future law that does it. 12 MR. CLEMENT: It - 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: There will always be a 14 future law that does it. 15 MR. CLEMENT: No, it -- it could be. There 16 still has to be a rational basis for it. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 18 MR. CLEMENT: And -- and - 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what we're 20 questioning. 21 MR. CLEMENT: Right, but a rational basis is 22 -- boy, you know, we have two sets of accounts. Half of 23 these accounts are going to be a nightmare to maintain. 24 We have an estimate from our controller -- this is in 25 the Cox litigation, but it's cited in one of the amicus
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 briefs. We've got an estimate from our controller 2 that's going to cost us $200,000 to upgrade and maintain 3 this system. We really don't want to spend that. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think I 5 don't see the answer - 6 MR. CLEMENT: Now, is that $200,000 7 associated - 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Excuse me. I don't 9 see the answer to Justice Scalia's question. You're 10 saying this would be a rational system going forward, 11 but you also promised the people that they would be 12 treated equally over a certain period. 13 When you start out it's not equal because 14 somebody pays $400 and somebody else pays 10,000, and - 15 but over the 30-year period, it's the same. That's why 16 it's equal in the beginning, even though somebody pays 17 400 and somebody pays 10,000 because they're going to 18 pay the same over the period. 19 Then you lop off the period. So, you're not 20 treating them equally. Go -- when you started. You can 21 no longer say don't worry about the inequality; it will 22 sort out in 30 years. Now you can't -- you have no way 23 of telling them why it's not unequal. 24 MR. CLEMENT: With all due respect, 25 Mr. Chief Justice, you're making this sound like it's an
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 estoppel case, like it's a Winstar case. It's not a 2 broken promise case. This is an equal protection case. 3 And the reason there's a rational difference at the time 4 Resolution 101 is, is because that point in time has 5 passed and they're in an different position. 6 But I also do want to make clear that you 7 will look in vain in the Barrett Law for this stern 8 promise that no matter what happens, we will eventually 9 collect the same amount from everybody. What there is, 10 is there is a requirement for equal assessment in the 11 first instance -- nobody says that was violated -- and 12 then, if you elect four installments, there's a 13 provision that says you shall collect. 14 The irony of their position is they say it's 15 perfectly okay for the city to break that promise. It's 16 perfectly okay to give forgiveness. They don't have a 17 quorum -- a quarrel with forgiveness. They want 18 forgiveness. They just want to get some refunds, too, 19 as a result. 20 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, they want forgiveness, 21 but you outline correctly in your brief the fact that 22 the city had three options. One of the options was to 23 hold everybody to what they understood when they signed 24 up under the Barrett Law. 25 And I -- I do not understand how your
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 administrative convenience argument fits in with the 2 decision to forgive the debt of the people who agreed to 3 pay on the installment plan. When the city was 4 collecting those payments was that a net loss? Were the 5 administrative costs of making those collections more 6 than the amount of money that was brought in? 7 If not, then I don't see how administrative 8 convenience justifies a rejection of that option. 9 MR. CLEMENT: Justice Alito, as I hear you, 10 you've switched from rational basis to it has to be, you 11 know, a net -- unless we can show a net loss, we lose. 12 Why can't we make a rational judgment that there's a 13 unique $200,000 cost associated with maintaining this 14 program? We don't want to maintain the program. It's 15 tremendously politically unpopular. We've moved away 16 from it. We don't want to -- I mean, can you imagine 17 the city - 18 JUSTICE ALITO: It's rational for a city to 19 say that it costs us $100,000 to collect this money, and 20 if we do collect it, we're going to bring in $500,000; 21 so, we don't want to pay the $100,000; so, we're going 22 to get rid of the program? That's rational? 23 MR. CLEMENT: It is rational, Justice Alito, 24 because they have to maintain an office to do it. You 25 know, think about the city. Do you really think -

1 JUSTICE ALITO: No, but the net -- the 2 net - 3 MR. CLEMENT: Do you really think - 4 JUSTICE ALITO: If the net -- if it's a net 5 gain, what is the rationality of abandoning it? 6 MR. CLEMENT: Because they want to get rid 7 of the office; they want to get out of the business; 8 they want to make a clean break. 9 Can you imagine the city 27 years from now 10 trying to take somebody's home by imposing and then 11 trying to enforce a tax lien based on a program that 12 they walked away from 27 years earlier? They'd get 13 laughed at. They couldn't do that. 14 And if they could make that judgment in - 15 another way of thinking about it, 10 years from now, 16 okay, they've collected everything from the 10-year 17 payers. All they've got left are the 20-year payers, 18 the 30-year payers. They say, you know, this is 19 ridiculous. It's still -- we're still taking in more 20 money than we're -- than it would cost, but it's 21 ridiculous. We want to get out of this business. We've 22 told the people - 23 JUSTICE ALITO: You put your finger on it. 24 They want to get out of the business. What they've done 25 is to shift the cost of the sewers from a -- from a

1 small group, a small interest group that is able to 2 presumably exert some political power to -- to 3 everybody. They spread the cost around to everybody. 4 And everybody -- the ordinary person who has to pay a 5 little bit more every month doesn't get all fired up 6 about it. 7 That's what this -- that's what this is 8 about, isn't it? 9 MR. CLEMENT: No, it's not what it's about, 10 the way you're describing it. Maybe there's a takings 11 claim for somebody to bring, but it's not an equal 12 protection claim. What you just articulated would be 13 exactly the same if there were a provision in the 14 Barrett Law that said, by the way, if we ever get rid of 15 the Barrett Law, all bets are off; we might not 16 collect the insolvency - 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is a 18 provision -- you said I'd search in vain for this 19 provision in the Barrett Law. 20 MR. CLEMENT: Yes. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I went and 22 searched and 15 - 23 (Laughter.) 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- 15(b)(3)says, 25 "The costs shall be primarily apportioned equally among
46

1 all abutting lands or lots." 2 MR. CLEMENT: Yes, that's the -- I -- I - 3 that's the provision I already mentioned about 4 appraisals. That's talking about the costs - 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It says "costs." 6 MR. CLEMENT: The costs of the project when 7 they are doing the appraisal. When they're coming up 8 with the cost for how much it's going to cost to stick 9 the pipes in the ground, they have a law that says it 10 has to be divided equally among the lots. That's an 11 assessment. There's a specific provision that you can 12 challenge the assessment if you don't like it. Once you 13 don't challenge it, it's final. 14 There's actually two provisions in the 15 Barrett Law that you won't search in vain for that talk 16 about the interest of finality, which is yet another 17 reason that justifies the differential treatment here 18 between people who have paid in full, their accounts are 19 closed, and people who have ongoing outstanding 20 balances. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where do I 22 look to find that when they say the costs shall be 23 apportioned equally, they are not referring to the 24 costs, but they were referring to the assessments? 25 MR. CLEMENT: They're referring to the costs

1 of the project, the improvement, that will then be 2 reflected - 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The costs of the 4 project are funded by the -- the sewer hook-ups, and 5 some people pay 400 and some people paY 10,000. 6 MR. CLEMENT: No, but it's the costs that 7 are then reflected in the assessment on each lot. And 8 there's then a process for challenging that assessment 9 on the assumption that the costs are allocated equally 10 to each lot, and then when that's done, the finality 11 provisions kick in. 12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that just - 13 MR. CLEMENT: And nobody says there was 14 anything wrong. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That just underscores the 16 promise of the State -- or the city that all owners will 17 be treated equally. That just underscores the point 18 that that was the understanding and the commitment. 19 MR. CLEMENT: With respect, that's not. 20 The original idea is, sure, you know, we're going to 21 assess the costs of the project equally among everybody 22 whose benefiting from the project. And then we're going 23 to have an assessment, and if the Barrett Law doesn't 24 change, the assumption is everybody's going to pay the 25 same amount.

1 I'm not here to tell you otherwise, but the 2 point is the Barrett Law, like most laws, doesn't have a 3 clause that plans for its own demise. It doesn't say, 4 well, you know, if -- if we get rid of this law, we 5 either will or will not enforce the installments. 6 And I think the question here is at a 7 different point in time when they've made a different 8 judgment -- we don't like the Barrett Law. It's proven 9 unpopular. It's proven unwieldy. It's not just 10 popularity or political. It's that, you know, they're 11 facing lots of low-income subdivisions with septic 12 tanks, and, you know, they're forcing the prospect of 13 trying to get people to pay $10,000 to improve a -- the 14 sewer on a house that's worth $50,000. They realize 15 that's a non-starter. We've got to get out of this 16 business. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You just said it's 18 not popularity. In page 1 of your brief, you say, "The 19 Barrett Law method eventually proved to be politically 20 unpopular." Sounds like it's popularity to me. 21 MR. CLEMENT: It's not just popularity. You 22 know, every once in a while the people have a point. 23 And it's not just that they don't like something; it's 24 their right to not like it. And they're very much right 25 to not like a law that says you got a $50,000 house and
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 we're going to make you pay for a $10,000 sewer hook-up. 2 They were right to get out of the business. 3 Having done that, I don't understand why they're saddled 4 with a provision of law that exists in the old law that 5 they're trying to get away from. 6 And just to be clear -- I mean, if you want 7 to look at a case that I think shows you why the State 8 law is not as equality ber alles as they're presenting, 9 take a look at an old Indiana case called Allendorf, 176 10 N.E. 240. That's a case where some people in the 11 project challenged the -- the assessment, said, you 12 know, that's unfair; it's too much. Other people paid 13 in full. 14 The people who challenged it went to court. 15 They eventually settled with the city for a reduced 16 amount. Then later on the people who had paid in full 17 went into court and said we're entitled to pay no more 18 than those guys. You know what the Indiana appellate 19 court said? No dice. That doesn't work. You 20 basically -- you either waived your right in express 21 waiver or if you paid in full, it's -- you know, it's 22 too late. It's too late. 23 So, the -- and this is, with respect, I 24 think part of the problem with the Allegheny Pittsburgh, 25 and particularly this extension of it. You're putting
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 so much weight on the State law, and it gets you in this 2 business of flyspecking the Barrett Law. 3 I mean, you know, this -- I mean, Justice 4 Thomas made this point very well in the Nordlinger case, 5 that there's an anomaly here, which is you're looking - 6 supposed to be looking at Federal law, and the violation 7 seems to be tied to potentially a violation of State 8 law. 9 If I could focus on that for a minute, 10 because this is another really important difference 11 between Allegheny Pittsburgh and this case, which speaks 12 right to the remedy. In Allegheny Pittsburgh, it's a 13 facially neutral statute. And so, it would be an 14 anomaly there to say that when there's a facially 15 neutral statute, you're going to invalidate the -- the 16 statute. The statute's fine. The problem is you've 17 been assessed at 100 percent; everybody else has been 18 assessed at 50 percent. The Court in that unique 19 context says, you know, there's no obligation to go and 20 sort of mandamus the assessor, to bring everybody else 21 up. You get to sort of go back to that level. 22 This is very different. The challenge here, 23 like in Nordlinger, is a challenge to a distinction 24 drawn in a law. Resolution 101, unlike the law in 25 Allegheny Pittsburgh, is not facially neutral. It draws
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 a distinction. So, the relevant question is the 2 rationality of that distinction. Is it rational? 3 We submit there are multiple reasons why it 4 is rational. But if you disagree with me, the obvious 5 remedy is to strike down the statute or at least remand 6 to the State court with express instructions that they 7 have the option, which is exactly what happened in the 8 sex discrimination cases. 9 And, Justice Scalia, if you're worried about 10 incentives and standing, look at Heckler v. Mathews, 11 another sex discrimination case. This exact issue came 12 up. And what the Court said is standing is based on 13 your right to guaranteed equal treatment. Whether or 14 not it's a pocketbook injury, you have standing if 15 you're denied equal treatment. 16 Now, these guys may have been denied equal 17 treatment on the assumption they're right. But they can 18 get equal treatment restored just as easily by 19 Resolution 101 being invalidated in full as they can by 20 getting an additional windfall by getting a refund. And 21 as Justice Alito - 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why is that -- why 23 is that a big deal for us? I mean, that's the law. You 24 get your -- your choice. 25 MR. CLEMENT: Okay. But, I mean, that's a
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 big difference because that's different from what 2 they're saying. They're saying there's no remedial 3 option. They're saying we are stuck now. We -- we have 4 to give refunds. That's the only permissible 5 constitutional remedy. And, obviously, the city would 6 prefer to get out of the Barrett Law business and to 7 provide these forgiveness, but it would certainly be a 8 lot better for the city if they would at least -- this 9 Court made clear, they have the option of leveling up or 10 leveling down. I do think, though, that gets to Justice 11 Kagan's - 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that -- if I 13 could -- you mentioned Heckler v. Mathews. In Heckler 14 v. Mathews, the Court said, quote: "Ordinarily, 15 extension" -- of the withheld benefit -- "rather than 16 nullification is the proper course." 17 MR. CLEMENT: Yes. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, while it is true 19 that you can cure a violation by leveling up or leveling 20 down, ordinarily, extension of the benefit is the proper 21 course. And that's for the reason Justice Scalia gave, 22 because, otherwise, there would be no equal protection 23 case brought. 24 MR. CLEMENT: If that were the rule, Heckler 25 v. Mathews would have come out the other way. The Court
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 was -- you know, the Court - 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what -- what 3 did the Court mean when they said, ordinarily, extension 4 is the proper course? 5 MR. CLEMENT: Well, they were talking about 6 a specific situation (a) under Federal law. So, I don't 7 know why the rule would be the same. And the sex 8 discrimination cases are much more on point for purposes 9 of this. But they're also talking about a very specific 10 context where you have a limitation on a benefit. And 11 the idea is, if you strike down the limitation, the 12 default option is everybody gets the benefit. 13 This is different. I mean, you know, really 14 what Heckler is talking about is severability concerns. 15 There's no severability that works here. Resolution 16 101 -- if you look at it, it doesn't say anything about 17 refunds. It simply says we're going to forgive the 18 balances on the outstanding accounts. 19 If that's somehow impermissible, then the 20 law goes. There's nothing to sever. There's nothing - 21 there's not one word in the statute about refunds. And 22 that's different from the context where you have a 23 general extension of benefits and you have some 24 limitations on the benefits. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think would
54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 happen if the city says -- if it came out that way -- we 2 really want to give refunds or cut off -- we want to 3 stop collecting the money, period? Then to make it fair 4 on this hypothesis, the city would have to go back and 5 refund money. To whom? And how many? 6 MR. CLEMENT: And -- and in what amount? 7 JUSTICE BREYER: And you heard your -- your 8 friend try to make a distinction between this project, 9 and you wouldn't have to give the money, he said, to 10 every other person, whoever back in 1850 or 1890 or 11 whenever it was began to make Barrett Law payments. But 12 you would with this one. 13 Now, what -- I'd like a little comment on 14 that. 15 MR. CLEMENT: Well, you're absolutely right. 16 And, you know -- and, you know, I talked about the 17 question - 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Right, because it's a 19 question. 20 MR. CLEMENT: Well -- okay. Then the answer 21 is it would be an administrative nightmare. If I 22 understand the question - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that. 24 Why? I mean, people paid the lump sum. 25 MR. CLEMENT: With respect to -
55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 JUSTICE SCALIA: If people come forward and 2 say I'm one of the ones who paid the lump sum, I want a 3 refund; and if somebody doesn't come and present such a 4 claim, the city doesn't pay. If someone does - 5 JUSTICE BREYER: That's right - 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely, the city has 7 records. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Let me try to get my 9 question, which is, I'm not -- I'm thinking this is 10 project 1. So, certainly, on the hypothesis, you have 11 to pay back the people who already paid up for project 12 1. But in your brief, you say there's project 2 through 13 20. And is there, in your opinion, a basis for 14 distinguishing all those people who have paid up in 15 those projects, or would you have to give them their 16 money back, too? 17 Now, you heard your friend's statement - 18 explanation of why you wouldn't have to give them the 19 money back, and I want to get your response to that. 20 MR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, what I 21 heard him say is we probably would. And I think we 22 certainly would as to most of the projects. There might 23 be a couple of the projects where the differences are so 24 small that he would say there's no gross inequality 25 there. But as to most of the other projects, there are
56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 still substantial differences - 2 JUSTICE BREYER: How many people does that 3 involve, about? 4 MR. CLEMENT: It involves -- you know, I 5 don't -- I know the number of projects. It's like 20 6 projects. So, I'm guessing it's at least 1,000 people. 7 And then, of course, somebody's going to come in if we 8 do that, as you suggested, and say wait a second - 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Was his figure of 10 2 million accurate? As the stake -- in the other case. 11 MR. CLEMENT: The stakes in the other case 12 without interest I think are $2.7 million. So, you 13 know, I think the -- the ballpark figures are right. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say "the 15 other case," you mean every other project? Because 16 that's -- that's, what, a class action; right? 17 MR. CLEMENT: It's -- it's a class action, 18 the Cox -- the Federal litigation. But still, that's 19 not a -- that's not an insubstantial amount. 20 Of course, the relevant question is not, you 21 know, are the damages a set figure after you've had 22 litigation in Federal court? The question is what is 23 the city administrator, at the time he's trying to 24 decide whether he has a refund obligation, to do? 25 And, Justice Scalia, you said, well, it's
57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 clear as mud. I mean, did you listen to the answer 2 about gross inequality? What, are they supposed to run 3 it through the gross inequality calculator that tells 4 them, well, you know, it's close, but it's not really - 5 there's not a discrete obligation? I don't know how -6 I would not know how to advise them as to which of the 7 other 21 projects they owed a refund to and which they 8 didn't. I would be at a complete loss. 9 And the reason - 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if 11 everybody -- if everybody entitled to a refund came 12 forward, it would cost you $2.7 million. And it - 13 MR. CLEMENT: No, actually it would -- plus 14 this one. So, it would be a little over 3. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Three - 16 $3 million. And you say the real problem is the huge 17 administrative cost in trying to figure out who you owe 18 it to. If it's that huge, all they do is somebody who 19 comes forward, asks for a refund, verify that they're - 20 you know, were a homeowner on the project, give them the 21 refund. 22 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I mean - 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The most it's going 24 to cost is $3 million. 25 MR. CLEMENT: Yes, in this case. And the -
58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 and the law that you develop here is not going to be 2 limited to this case; it's going to apply in other 3 contexts as well. Heaven knows where it stops. As I 4 said, Allegheny Pittsburgh -- it was at least limited to 5 a particular context. Now, I mean, I don't know why any 6 city ever -- I mean, maybe this is the limiting 7 principle that no city ever again will provide amnesty 8 or forgiveness under any circumstances. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Amnesty -- I don't 10 get -- amnesty is entirely different. Amnesty is for 11 people who did something wrong. Nobody did something 12 wrong here; it wasn't wrong to pay with installments. 13 MR. CLEMENT: But, Mr. Chief Justice, 14 it's the - 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the amnesty cases 16 don't apply. 17 MR. CLEMENT: It's the same principle. I 18 mean, I could certainly see some -- you know, suppose 19 the city elects a laissez-faire mayor and says you know 20 what? Parking tickets -- it's not worth the hassle; 21 we're going to getting out of the parking ticket 22 enforcement business, and we're going to forgive 23 everybody their parking tickets. 24 If I had just paid my parking tickets, I'd 25 be hacked off, but I wouldn't feel like I had a Federal
59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 constitutional right to get my money back. And that's 2 the difference - 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you do with the 4 hypothetical about the income tax and the sales tax? 5 So, you don't pay any income tax if the sales tax had 6 gone into effect. 7 MR. CLEMENT: I think if they really got rid 8 of the -- the Federal tax forever, I don't think there 9 would be an equal protection violation. I think there 10 might be a different constitutional violation. If you 11 listen to him, the first thing he ticked off about why 12 that would be so horrible is there was no notice. Well, 13 that sounds like a due process concern to me, not an 14 equal protection concern. 15 And that's really what's happening here. 16 When they transport Allegheny Pittsburgh from the 17 context it arose in to this very different context, 18 they're converting it from an equal protection case to 19 something more like a contract clause case or to a 20 Winstar case or something like that. And not one word 21 in that opinion suggests that once a State adopts a 22 certain policy, that it's trapped. It can't make a 23 reasonable and rational transition away from that policy 24 to a policy that better serves the citizenry. 25 JUSTICE ALITO: Is -
60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. CLEMENT: And if it doesn't - 2 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there some identified or 3 identifiable demographic difference between the two 4 groups that either justifies or could on -- on a remand 5 justify the different treatment? 6 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think the one -- I 7 don't think there's a demographic difference. I think 8 the one concrete difference that really is a difference 9 is, from the city's perspective, they're looking at two 10 groups, all of whom are going to have to pay a new 11 higher monthly fee. 12 And I think they can make a rational 13 decision that says, look, you know, one of these groups 14 has to make two monthly payments to the city for sewer 15 and water. That seems a little crazy. So, why are 16 we -- what we'll do is we'll just make everybody in the 17 city in terms of their ongoing payments to the city for 18 sewer and water -- we will treat them all exactly the 19 same. One fee. 20 Thank you, Your Honor. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 22 Mr. Stancil, you have 4 minutes remaining. 23 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL 24 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 25 MR. STANCIL: Justice Alito, I want to just
61

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 pick up right there. What they're actually saying on 2 these two monthly payments idea is that it's rational 3 for somebody who's just paid $300, and now everybody 4 pays an extra $10 a month -- we don't want them to have 5 to make their $30 a month Barrett Law payment having 6 paid $300 and the extra 10. 7 My clients still have to pay the extra $10 a 8 month, but we're out of pocket $9,300. I think that is 9 -- I think that's patently irrational, to say that we're 10 trying to help people who are out 300 bucks from having 11 to pay an extra $30 a month going forward. 12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stancil, here's what 13 worries me about this case: To me, this is a case about 14 transition rules. All legislation creates classes of 15 citizens, and some are -- and -- and puts them all in a 16 group and says you're going to be treated in the same 17 way as long as this legislation exists. And then a 18 legislature comes along and changes that piece of 19 legislation, and different people are affected 20 differently by it. 21 And to me what you are suggesting is that 22 when that break is made and when that transition occurs, 23 the -- I don't know how you would apply the rule that 24 you're suggesting, which is that everybody in the former 25 class has to be treated the same as a matter of
62

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 transition policy. 2 MR. STANCIL: If you've promised equal 3 treatment -- and we're talking about a -- this is a -- a 4 specific case. A specific commonly shared benefit among 5 people who are indistinguishable on any rational basis. 6 They live next door to each other; they flush into the 7 same pipe; and they paid and were promised equal 8 payment. In that instance, you -- then there has to be 9 a rational method. You have to treat them equally when 10 you transition. 11 So, there may be times where the city has 12 promised and committed, and there is no independent 13 rational basis for distinguishing. 14 It's not that -- if we want to go forward 15 and we want to tax blondes instead of brunettes, well, 16 the fact that we're going to start doing that 17 prospectively doesn't make that okay. And, moreover, 18 this isn't prospective. We're talking about an 19 assessment historically imposed on the very same day for 20 the very same. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: But time is usually a 22 rational reason for doing it. If -- suppose everybody 23 paid on the installment plan. The city could say as of 24 a certain date we're -- no more installment payments. 25 And the people who paid up previously, would -- would
63

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 they be -- would they have an equal protection claim? 2 MR. STANCIL: If we -- I'm sorry. I 3 thought - 4 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that there had never 5 been the option of making the lump-sum payment. 6 Everybody paid on installment plans over a 10-year 7 period, and then the city decided January 1, 2012, no 8 more installment plans; everything that's still due is 9 forgiven. That would be rational, wouldn't it? 10 MR. STANCIL: Right. Because we'd all be 11 treated equally. 12 Could I quickly get to the administrative 13 nightmare? In -- if you go to the Cox litigation and go 14 on Pacer and you pull up document number 98, you'll find 15 the city's filing in the Cox case, in which they give 16 the name and address and amount of -- owed to every 17 taxpayer under any of these 20 other Barrett Law 18 projects. This is -- I think it's -- I think it's 19 ludicrous to say there's some Gordian knot that would 20 have to be cut to issue refunds. 21 But, more generally, I think this is part of 22 the city's argument. They say, well, perfection may be 23 difficult to achieve. Well, so be it. It always is; 24 but that does not justify gross disparities and 25 "anything goes." You may want to make a clean break and
64

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 go to a new system, fine. But you have to do it in a 2 way that treats the same people the same. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: The argument isn't that 4 it's expensive to administer as much as it is there are 5 1,000 people in all these projects who are already paid 6 up. We don't have enough money to pay them all back. 7 That's why we don't want to pay them back. At the same 8 time, we don't want to collect the money for 30 years 9 from these other people who aren't fully paid yet. 10 MR. STANCIL: Well, if that's the case - 11 JUSTICE BREYER: The question, I guess, is, 12 is that rational? 13 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. Simply 14 sending in your tax bill -- again, if you sent in your 15 taxes yesterday, are you "too bad, so sad"? I don't 16 think that's rational. 17 And I want to get back to reliance interest 18 because -- I can't. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 20 The case is submitted. 21 (Whereupon at 11:09 a.m., the case in the 22 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 23 24 25
