3 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument in the

4 case of Smith against Massachusetts.

5 Mr. Nathanson.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. NATHANSON

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8 MR. NATHANSON: Justice Stevens, and may it

9 please the Court:

10 The trial judge found Melvin Smith not guilty on

11 the merits and unequivocally so. That acquittal entitled

12 Melvin Smith to repose. Instead, what he got was a moving

13 target. The trial judge's later reconsideration of

14 Smith's acquittal placed him in jeopardy for that same

15 offense twice.

16 Smith's position on the matter is completely

17 faithful to this Court's precedent, and it makes sense in

18 the real-world practice of criminal law.

19 The State, on the other hand, asks this Court to

20 make exceptions to the rule, long-held, that acquittals

21 terminate jeopardy.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. Just to say that this --

23 what happened here was not a final determination.

24 Take an analog -- an analogy to rule 54(b). The

25 judge can say, yes, I've made this ruling and it sticks.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1 You see, I'm going to give you a separate piece of paper

2 that says judgment, but if I don't give you that separate

3 piece of paper, even though I said judgment granted, it

4 doesn't count until the very end of the case. I can

5 always change my mind. Why shouldn't it operate the same

6 way on the criminal side?

7 MR. NATHANSON: Well, first of all, obviously,

8 that's a civil case. The Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't

9 apply to civil cases. Second of all -- except with some

10 rare exceptions.

11 What I think the best way to -- to really define

12 finality here -- and -- and whatever finality is, I really

13 do think we -- we do have it here because this Court has

14 said an acquittal under Martin Linen, a resolution,

15 correct or not, of some or all if the factual elements --

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I looked at Martin

17 Linen, and there, there was something labeled judgment of

18 acquittal entered. Here we have an endorsement on a

19 motion, and then we have an entry by the clerk saying --

20 what does the entry say? Motion granted or something like

21 that.

22 MR. NATHANSON: Allowed, and it was attested by

23 the clerk.

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But is there -- this

25 might be significant. Is there in Massachusetts, when a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 motion for acquittal is granted and there are other

2 charges still going on, is there a piece of paper that

3 says, judgment, acquitted on count whatever it was?

4 MR. NATHANSON: No, Your Honor. The -- the

5 formal rule, which is not always observed, but the formal

6 rule is that it must be recorded on -- on the docket and

7 announced in an open courtroom. That happened here.

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose you have a State

9 and the State has a statute, and the statute says any

10 motion for acquittal may be granted by the -- the trial

11 court at the close of the prosecution's evidence, but that

12 motion shall not be deemed final and may be reviewed by

13 the district court at any time before -- or by the trial

14 court at any time before the submission of the case to the

15 jury. Then there's no repose element because the -- the

16 defendant is on notice that this may not be final. What

17 would be the -- your position in that case if a statute

18 like that were on the books? And if you say that that's

19 different, then I'll say, well, suppose the supreme court

20 of Massachusetts just makes up this rule as a judicial

21 matter.

22 MR. NATHANSON: Well, to answer the first

23 question, I think that if -- if such a statute were

24 enacted, I'm willing to grant, for purposes of this case,

25 that it wouldn't be a double jeopardy problem. It may in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 a later case -- and you know, I'd be very interested in

2 that -- a problem under a combination of Jackson and

3 Winship because the defendant may have a -- a right to

4 that determination.

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay, well, let -- let's just

6 assume that you've conceded that. Now, you've been

7 guarded about it. If we can do that by statute, why can't

8 we do that by a judicial decision by the supreme court of

9 -- Judicial Court of Massachusetts?

10 MR. NATHANSON: Well, first of all, the Supreme

11 Judicial Court of Massachusetts is the one who promulgated

12 the rules in this case. Rule 25(a) is promulgated by the

13 Supreme Judicial Court of --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but they put a gloss on

15 the rule by their decision.

16 MR. NATHANSON: Well, that was the Massachusetts

17 Appeals Court, I might add.

18 Second of all, the rule itself requires that the

19 motion shall be ruled upon at that time. It says nothing

20 about reconsideration, and clearly --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: They've held that in this case.

22 We have a Massachusetts decision. It's their law and

23 under their law in Massachusetts, the judge can revise it.

24 MR. NATHANSON: Actually --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it isn't their law,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 then I don't know how -- why they affirmed this conviction

2 rather than reversing it.

3 MR. NATHANSON: I'm not sure I know either, Your

4 Honor.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, but I mean, I -- I

6 take it that it is their law, otherwise I'd see reversal,

7 wouldn't I, and not affirmance?

8 MR. NATHANSON: Actually I think what they

9 did --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: What?

11 MR. NATHANSON: -- Your Honor, is they assumed

12 that there was an error in -- in -- when dealing strictly

13 with the rule, at the -- at the end of the section dealing

14 with this, they assume that there was an error and said no

15 prejudice, which I've contended in the brief --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so in other words,

17 they're saying that in this case -- how could there not be

18 prejudice? He had another trial. I mean -- how could --

19 I don't understand this from beginning to end then.

20 But let me go back to my original question.

21 What rule do you propose?

22 MR. NATHANSON: As for finality, the rule I

23 propose is, first of all, we have to start with the basic

24 foundation, which is an acquittal, under Martin Linen with

25 a resolution --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm saying is, for double

2 jeopardy purposes --

3 MR. NATHANSON: Yes.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: -- an acquittal in your view is

5 an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes when?

6 MR. NATHANSON: There's -- there's three things

7 that I think Court should look at. One, first of all,

8 because we treat acquittals from the bench for double

9 jeopardy purposes the same as acquittals from a jury, a

10 prosecutor can poll a jury immediately after the verdict.

11 A prosecutor clearly --

12 JUSTICE BREYER: No. I'm asking you for a --

13 I'd have to write -- if I agreed with you, I'd have to say

14 we have here a judge who changed his mind. Under the

15 clause of the Constitution, a judge cannot change his mind

16 when. Now, go ahead. Now, fill in the blanks.

17 MR. NATHANSON: Yes.

18 JUSTICE BREYER: According -- I know what their

19 rule is. Their rule is a judge can change his mind up to

20 the point that the jury is dismissed, something like that.

21 I understand that. Now, I want to know what your rule --

22 is your rule a judge cannot change his mind once he writes

23 the word acquittal on a piece of paper, even if he says,

24 oh my God, I meant to say no acquittal? Too late. Too

25 late. Okay, now, so I want to know what your rule is. Is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that the rule?

2 MR. NATHANSON: No, Your Honor.

3 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What is the rule?

4 MR. NATHANSON: The -- your first question --

5 the constitutional point of no return, shall we say, is

6 further proceedings. If there is an acquittal and there

7 are further proceedings --

8 JUSTICE BREYER: There is no further proceeding

9 if he writes the word acquittal, I guess until he changes

10 his mind. So 3 minutes later, he says I change my mind.

11 Now there are further proceedings.

12 MR. NATHANSON: Well, then at that point you

13 look to other indicia of finality that this -- this Court

14 referenced that in -- in Vincent, and that -- that's

15 generally compliance with State procedure. Compliance

16 with State procedures --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: I need to write a simple rule.

18 All I'm trying to get from you is what is your rule. Is

19 your rule that when a judge writes the word acquittal --

20 an acquittal, by the way, happens to mean there's nothing

21 left for the jury to do on that charge. That's what it

22 means. When he writes the word acquittal, he cannot change

23 it. Is that your rule?

24 MR. NATHANSON: No. The rule is that the --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And what is your rule?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. NATHANSON: The rule is that the judge

2 cannot change it, as a matter of Federal constitutional

3 law, if there are further proceedings. In a multi-count

4 case, count A is acquitted. We initiate further

5 proceedings on count B and C.

6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But your answer just isn't

7 responsive. When has it become final?

8 MR. NATHANSON: It ripens at the --

9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: When? When the judge says

10 something, when he writes something? When does it become

11 final? At what point in time?

12 MR. NATHANSON: What I'm suggesting is --

13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What is your proposed rule?

14 You haven't said yet.

15 MR. NATHANSON: What -- what I'm suggesting is

16 -- is two things.

17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Just one thing. Just when

18 does it become final? Let's limit it to one thing.

19 MR. NATHANSON: It -- it becomes final when

20 there are further proceedings initiated.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: Sorry. I don't understand

22 that.

23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: That doesn't make sense.

24 MR. NATHANSON: The -- the -- that is the line

25 drawn by most of the lower courts.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: You're not understanding my

2 question then. Imagine a case in which a judge writes the

3 word acquittal. Now, half an hour later, he thinks, oh,

4 my God, what have I done. The jury is still sitting

5 there. Of course, they're sitting there because he hasn't

6 had a chance to dismiss them yet. They happened to be

7 having lunch or something. Is it final?

8 MR. NATHANSON: It is not final --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: It is not final.

10 MR. NATHANSON: -- if -- if the defense has not

11 been forced at that point to choose to rest or put on a

12 case. That is the --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: Say that again.

14 MR. NATHANSON: If the defense is forced to rest

15 or put on a case.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: But he wrote the word

17 acquittal. There's nothing more for anybody to do until

18 he changes the word.

19 MR. NATHANSON: Well, I think we're talking

20 about two separate things. Is Your Honor's question

21 presupposing a single-count case or a multi-count?

22 JUSTICE BREYER: Let's try single-count. Okay?


23 MR. NATHANSON: Okay. 


24 JUSTICE BREYER: There he is. He writes the


25 word acquittal and the jury says, oh, what do we do now?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Go home, says the clerk. Now, before they can get out the

2 door or anything else happens, before they get out the

3 door, he says, oh, my God, I made a mistake. Can he do

4 that under your rule?

5 MR. NATHANSON: I'm not entirely sure of the

6 answer to the question, Your Honor, but I -- I think,

7 first of all, we look at compliance with State procedure.

8 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What I thought from

9 reading your brief, which you're confirming, is your rule

10 -- once the judge says acquittal, that's the end of it.

11 If he decides 3 seconds later, he cannot change his mind.

12 Now, that rule to me is inconsistent with most law.

13 MR. NATHANSON: If we're talking about a

14 clerical error, Your Honor, the Massachusetts rules and

15 the Federal rules provide for correction of clerical

16 errors. What -- what we're talking about here is not a

17 clerical error, but the judge clearly intended to do what

18 she did.

19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, was your client --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But a very plain error --

21 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- was your client prejudiced

22 in any way by not putting on some evidence that the -- he

23 would have put on?

24 MR. NATHANSON: May I begin, Your Honor --

25 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Just answer the question for

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 once.

2 MR. NATHANSON: Yes, Your Honor. There -- there

3 was a defense that he essentially forfeited by not being

4 aware that the judge was going to, at some point --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was a terribly risky

6 defense because his main defense is I wasn't there, I

7 didn't do it, somebody else did it. How could he then

8 turn around and say I missed the opportunity to tell the

9 jury I really was there, but it was okay for me to have

10 the gun? I mean, what -- what defense counsel would do

11 that after having spent his whole effort to say it was the

12 other guy, it wasn't this defendant? And then to make

13 this defense that he had a right to possess this gun

14 because he belonged in the house, that would be

15 extraordinary.

16 MR. NATHANSON: Your Honor, counsel for co-

17 defendant, Felicia Brown, presented just such a defense

18 and she was acquitted. She presented the defense that

19 Melvin Smith did not shoot Christopher Robinson, but if

20 Melvin --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Nobody charged her with

22 possessing a gun.

23 MR. NATHANSON: But what I'm saying is --

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- look, there were a

25 lot of charges in this case, and we're dealing with what

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 is a relatively lesser offense of this whole string of

2 events so that Brown being acquitted of other offenses

3 doesn't say anything about this offense, which relates to

4 the possession of a gun. That's -- that's all that it is.

5 MR. NATHANSON: What I'm saying is that it

6 wasn't risky, Your Honor, because the -- this jury was

7 willing to consider an alternative defense that would have

8 otherwise appeared as a concession. They did not take it

9 as a concession.

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he would be -- the

11 defendant -- you know, he hasn't gone to the jury yet, and

12 the jury would say, my goodness, this is like a common law

13 pleader. I didn't borrow the kettle. It was broken when

14 I got it. Or, I returned it unbroken. To -- to do that, to

15 say I wasn't there, that's my main defense, but then,

16 jury, I'd like you also to consider that if you think that

17 I was there, then -- it -- it really doesn't fly as a

18 criminal defense.

19 MR. NATHANSON: I'd just respectfully disagree,

20 Your Honor. But -- but the -- the larger point is if we

21 allow this rule in general, we are going to engender

22 serious problems. I'm saying that there -- that there was

23 some reliance here, but we're going to engender much more

24 serious problems in other cases where a defendant perhaps

25 presents a defense that is helpful to the remaining

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 charges, but damaging on the acquitted charge.

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if -- if -- you

3 know, we shape the expectation by what we say. If -- if

4 we say that a judge is always free to consider his ruling

5 and as long as the -- there's a right to reopen, then any

6 kind of reliance is -- is misplaced.

7 MR. NATHANSON: What Massachusetts law says in

8 -- in the Zavala case, they said that there is not a right

9 to reopen where the judge has determined that the evidence

10 is insufficient.

11 Second of all --

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That is when the case is not

13 ongoing. I mean, here we had a case that was continuing

14 and -- and the judge said, oops, I made a mistake, which

15 is common at the trial level. I mean, these decisions --

16 she made this decision in a split second. Maybe she was

17 too hasty, and then a trial judge will say, my law clerk

18 went to the library at lunch, there was a Supreme Judicial

19 Court of Massachusetts case going just the other way, so

20 of course, I confess error, but the defendant isn't

21 prejudice.

22 The defendant hadn't put on a -- well, the -- it

23 came up at closing. Right? So if the defendant was

24 prejudice, anyway he could have said, wait a minute,

25 judge, I want to put on that defense that I really was

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there but I had a right to have the gun.

2 MR. NATHANSON: He didn't say that, Your Honor.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he could have. So he --

4 so I don't see that you have a realistic claim of

5 prejudice.

6 MR. NATHANSON: Well, I -- I don't think

7 prejudice is a factor in double jeopardy jurisprudence.

8 Either the defendant has been placed twice in jeopardy or

9 he has not.

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you have to set a --

11 a point in time, and your point is -- well, it's not

12 exactly clear, but there's one point that says when the

13 jury is discharged. Then there may be other reasons why

14 there's unfairness to the defendant so that you wouldn't

15 permit it, other than double jeopardy. But if -- why

16 isn't that a sensible place to draw the line?

17 MR. NATHANSON: Because if -- if discharge of

18 the jury is the rule, then the judge can reconsider an

19 acquittal at any point in a defendant's case. 2 weeks

20 into a defense case, the judge could reconsider an

21 acquittal.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The question -- we're talking

23 about a Federal constitutional rule, and suppose -- you

24 pointed out this went only to an intermediate appellate

25 court. Suppose the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 interpreted its rule at 25(a) and it says, that rule

2 allows some leeway for the judge to say I got it wrong as

3 long as there's no prejudice to the defense. That's what

4 our rule means.

5 MR. NATHANSON: I don't think that's

6 permissible, Your Honor. It -- it is -- granted, for

7 purposes of this argument, that it's permissible for

8 States to order judges to withhold rulings, that there

9 shall be no ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence

10 prior to the return of a jury verdict. Louisiana, for

11 example, does that, and I think Oklahoma.

12 But for the Supreme Judicial -- Judicial Court

13 of Massachusetts to say that an acquittal has no force is

14 simply straight contravening what this Court has said.

15 It's -- it's essentially a continuing jeopardy argument.

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you do agree, I take it,

17 that if the judge says, yes, I agree with you, there isn't

18 a scintilla of evidence, and -- and at some point I'm --

19 I'm going to enter an acquittal, but I'm not going to do

20 it now just in case I have a second thought, but at least

21 by the -- the end of the trial, I'll take care of it, you,

22 I take it, concede that that is permissible.

23 MR. NATHANSON: I think that is permissible

24 because --

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if that -- if that's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 permissible, if you win this case, isn't that going to be

2 the way trials are conducted when -- when there are mid-

3 trial motions like yours? Every judge is going to say,

4 yes, looks as though you -- you got them there, but I'll

5 -- I'll just hold onto this until things are over, and

6 then I'll rule. That's -- that's the way they're all

7 going to respond, isn't it?

8 MR. NATHANSON: No, I don't think so, Your

9 Honor. I think judges are -- are intelligent people.

10 They read the pleadings beforehand. Justice Donovan

11 clearly read the pleading beforehand in this case, and she

12 -- she was prepared to ask for argument on it. I don't

13 think that judges do these things so precipitously that

14 they are not going to be confident in their ruling.

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but every judge knows he

16 drops a catch once in a while, and -- and if he wants to

17 guard against wrecking the whole trial or -- or creating

18 an appellate issue later, he's just going to be cautious

19 and hold onto it.

20 MR. NATHANSON: And judges should be cautious,

21 Your Honor.

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it also important to

23 know, though, whether the defendant has to put on a case

24 or not? So he can't just reserve judgment. I'll tell you

25 after the trial is over whether you should put a case on

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 or not.

2 MR. NATHANSON: That -- that is, in fact, the

3 point, Justice Stevens. The Double Jeopardy Clause is a

4 constitutional policy of finality for the defendant's

5 benefit. He -- that's what this Court said in Jorn. The

6 defendant has to know whether he -- he's defending a case.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: But does -- does --

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the defendant here ask to

9 be -- to have the right to reopen?

10 MR. NATHANSON: He did not.

11 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: May I ask --

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Did he --

13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- you another question here?

14 There -- there were three charges against your client, as

15 I understand it. Unlawful possession of a firearm.

16 That's the one we're talking about.

17 MR. NATHANSON: Yes, Your Honor.

18 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Assault with intent to

19 murder.

20 MR. NATHANSON: Yes.

21 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Assault and battery by means

22 of a dangerous weapon.

23 MR. NATHANSON: Yes.

24 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: The jury convicted on all

1 MR. NATHANSON: Yes.

2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, he was given concurrent

3 sentences.

4 MR. NATHANSON: Yes, Your Honor.

5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that correct?

6 MR. NATHANSON: Yes, Your Honor.

7 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So would you explain to me if

8 there's any practical effect to your winning in this case?

9 MR. NATHANSON: There is a practical effect.

10 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What is it?

11 MR. NATHANSON: Firearm possession offenses in

12 Massachusetts have restrictions as to parole and good time

13 deductions that the other offenses do not have. So there

14 is a practical effect, aside from the fact that it's a --

15 it's a conviction on his record, Your Honor.

16 Moving on, Justice Breyer, just to address the

17 question that you were asking me, I think perhaps a good

18 way to phrase it is -- is if the first factual resolution

19 of the elements of -- of the offense results in acquittal,

20 there can be no further proceedings.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: What I was thinking is -- I

22 mean, here a judge -- I guess she was harried in the

23 trial, she's thinking to herself, well, let's see, is

24 there any evidence here that this was less than the

25 shotgun -- this was not a shotgun. You know, it had to be

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 a barrel less than 16 inches. So is there any evidence

2 here of the shotgun? And she, I guess, forgot that there

3 was a lot of evidence that it was a pistol. Now, there

4 aren't many pistols that are 16 inches long. So she's

5 thinking, something may be missing here. She's a little

6 uncertain, but she writes acquittal, and then a few

7 minutes later, she thinks, let's say, oh, my God, there

8 was all that evidence about the pistol. So I shouldn't

9 have done that.

10 I mean, how -- how is a judge like that, a

11 hypothetical -- what's she supposed to do? Is she

12 supposed to say, I better not enter anything, because

13 after all, I don't care if the defendant has to produce a

14 case? Or is she supposed to enter something and think,

15 well, I could change my mind before it's over? Or what is

16 she supposed to do? She just thinks she made a mistake.

17 MR. NATHANSON: So your hypothetical is that

18 there's evidence of two guns?

19 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought here there was

20 evidence there was a pistol, but maybe I'm wrong.

21 MR. NATHANSON: I'm sorry. Yes, in this case --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: There was evidence it was a

23 pistol. So I -- I would have thought, reading this, that

24 there was evidence. That's beside the point, but I'm --

25 I'm just using it as an example where a judge might think

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 she made a mistake. She thought there was no evidence

2 that it wasn't a shotgun, and I guess she forgot that

3 there was evidence it was a pistol and a pistol is not a

4 shotgun.

5 MR. NATHANSON: She -- she clearly didn't

6 forget. The prosecutor said to her the evidence was

7 testified to that it was a pistol, it was a revolver, it

8 was a .32 --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm quite sure -- not

10 quite sure then why she wrote down there was no evidence

11 it wasn't a shotgun, but she had some reason. And now a

12 few minutes later, she thinks, boy, whatever my reason is,

13 it couldn't have been that good. Or maybe she thinks that

14 that's a reason an hour from now or maybe a day from now.

15 What's the line? Suppose she thinks of it a second from

16 now. Suppose she thinks the instant she writes acquittal,

17 she thought, oh, my God, a pistol is not a shotgun. Of

18 course, it isn't. I know that. I better change it. Is

19 it a second from now? Is it she can never change it no

20 matter what once the pen leaves the paper? What's your

21 rule?

22 MR. NATHANSON: In a single-count case, Your

23 Honor --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Whether it's single-count or

25 double-count or triple-count. I want to know what -- how

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you see it, not how I see it.

2 MR. NATHANSON: It -- compliance with State

3 procedure informs the inquiry and once -- once we have

4 what is determined to be a resolution --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Once it's final under State

6 procedure, right? And you also would add once there's no

7 clerical error. She didn't mistakenly say, you know,

8 affirm when she meant to write deny. Leaving that aside,

9 once it's final under State procedure, it's final.

10 MR. NATHANSON: That's correct, Your Honor.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: And sometimes it's wrong.

12 MR. NATHANSON: That's correct.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it'd be sometimes wrong no

14 matter how you define final. I mean, you know, she

15 let's --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: That's excellent.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- let's all the evidence on

18 and -- and does it after all the evidence is there, and

19 then she -- and then at the close of all the evidence, she

20 gives a directed verdict for -- for the defendant, and

21 then discharges the jury, and as soon as the jury walks

22 out, oh, my God, what a mistake I made. Too bad. Right?

23 I mean, we say double jeopardy.

24 MR. NATHANSON: Correct, Your Honor. That's

25 what --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Excellent. That was an

2 excellent answer.

3 (Laughter.)

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I would like to know,

5 given that answer, why is this final under State procedure

6 because it seems as if the State courts of Massachusetts

7 have said, no, it is not a constitutional error to go and

8 look into this again. She can change her mind. And

9 that's what I'd like you to focus on because I agree that

10 that was a good explanation of the rule.

11 MR. NATHANSON: If -- if State procedure, as in

12 this --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm thinking of this case.

14 MR. NATHANSON: Yes.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose I took Justice Scalia's

16 rule and I said, that's the rule. Now, I would say that's

17 the rule of a Federal law. Very well. That turns on your

18 decision here being final as a matter of State law, but it

19 seems to me we have State courts here saying, at least for

20 double jeopardy purposes, it isn't final as a matter of

21 State law. And therefore, I want to know how we reach

22 your conclusion here.

23 MR. NATHANSON: Well, there's -- there clearly

24 is a line beyond which the State cannot go, and that's

25 what Justice Brennan was talking about in his concurrence

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in Lydon. He said the -- the State cannot fashion a

2 procedure whereby the judge never discharges the jury, and

3 in -- in Kepner, this Court held that the Philippine

4 procedure of withholding finality from an acquittal in a

5 bench trial also violated the Constitution. So State

6 procedure does not control. It is sufficient but not

7 necessary.

8 If -- if you comply with State procedure to say

9 this is -- this is an acquittal, okay, it's an acquittal.

10 If you do not comply with State procedure, it can still be

11 an acquittal under Federal law.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does the State have the power

13 to say whether -- whether an acquittal under State law

14 constitutes an acquittal for purposes of Federal

15 constitutional double jeopardy purposes? Is that a State

16 law question or a Federal question?

17 MR. NATHANSON: No. It -- it is a Federal

18 question, Your Honor. This Court --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was.

20 MR. NATHANSON: -- this Court said that in

21 Smalis quite clearly.

22 If I -- if I may, two things and then I'd like

23 to reserve. But the -- the State would have this Court

24 draw a distinction between acquittals by a judge and

25 acquittals by a jury. That simply has been rejected by

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 this Court numerous times. Sanabria, Rumsey. An

2 acquittal is an acquittal.

3 Again, the -- the State would have this Court

4 draw distinctions between acquittals based on law and

5 acquittals based on fact. Sanabria unequivocally rejected

6 that. Sanabria says that in fact sufficiency of the

7 evidence is not a legal defense. An acquittal is an

8 acquittal.

9 If there are no further questions, I'd like to

10 reserve the balance of my time.

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

12 Ms. Neaves.

13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHRYN A. NEAVES

14 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

15 MS. NEAVES: Justice Stevens, and may it please

16 the Court:

17 I'd like to start with where the Court left off

18 on the notion of reconsideration and finality. The

19 Massachusetts Appeals Court here specifically stated that

20 a judge's right to reconsider his or her legal rulings is

21 firmly rooted in the common law and permitted Judge

22 Donovan in this case to reconsider her legal ruling that

23 the evidence was insufficient. Certainly that common law

24 right of reconsideration could not run afoul of this

25 Court's double jeopardy jurisprudence, but the appeals

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 court specifically stated that the Double Jeopardy Clause

2 was not violated because there was no second proceeding

3 and that the judge in this case, therefore, was permitted

4 to reconsider her ruling.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if this had

6 been the sole count, the gun possession count had been the

7 sole count, and -- and the same ruling had been made by

8 the judge? Would you say that there was double jeopardy

9 attaching or not?

10 MS. NEAVES: Not so long as the jury was still

11 there. If the prosecutor had the opportunity to say,

12 Judge Donovan, give me 10 minutes, I know there's a

13 Supreme Judicial Court case on the point that I'm arguing

14 to you, which is that you did not need a witness to

15 directly testify that the gun barrel length was less than

16 16 inches, I know there's a case, give me 10 minutes, take

17 a recess, and if the judge agreed to do that and the

18 prosecutor came back and gave the case to the judge and

19 the judge said, absolutely, you're -- you're correct, I'm

20 going to send the charge to the jury, there's no double

21 jeopardy violation there.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: And what if it's a bench trial?

23 MS. NEAVES: A bench trial is a very difficult

24 situation. And the Smalis case certainly seems to be the

25 hardest case here, but bench trials present different -- a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 different situation because the judge is both the fact-

2 finder and the law-giver. And in that context, it's much

3 more difficult --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: I know it's difficult. What's

5 your answer?

6 MS. NEAVES: My answer to that is I believe that

7 if the judge stated the evidence is insufficient, as -- as

8 the judge did in Smalis, as the trier of fact and law, I

9 find the evidence --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's over.

11 MS. NEAVES: It's over. It's over.

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The minute --

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: What if in the case --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the minute he --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- we have before us the State

16 allowed an interlocutory appeal on behalf of the

17 prosecution right after the judge's ruling?

18 MS. NEAVES: In a jury case, Your Honor?

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

20 MS. NEAVES: I think --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Conceivably they could allow

22 an interlocutory appeal from a judgment of acquittal at

23 the close of the prosecution's case.

24 MS. NEAVES: If such a -- if such a process

25 could be put in place where there was an appellate panel

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that would be willing and available to hear that while the

2 jury remained empaneled, I don't think it would run afoul

3 of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: But is that necessary? I -- I

6 mean, that's what I think is the difficult question here.

7 Can you say that it's final for purposes of the decision-

8 maker outside that courtroom, namely an appellate court,

9 but it's not final in respect to the judge having a right

10 to change his mind within the court? That -- that makes a

11 lot of sense to me, but I don't know if it's possible to

12 get there.

13 Why not? I -- I think, well, the reason is that

14 you want judges to be able to reconsider things and you

15 don't have that problem when you're talking about an

16 appeal.

17 MS. NEAVES: That is --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: Or is there any -- is there

19 any, in other words, to reconcile our case that you're

20 talking about, Smalis?

21 MS. NEAVES: The Smalis case?

22 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes.

23 MS. NEAVES: I think there are a number of ways

24 to reconcile it. Certainly Massachusetts' position is

25 that it's the difference between a bench trial and a jury

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 trial, but there is also no doubt that the case left the

2 trial court and went up on appeal. I think both of those

3 factors are significant.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't -- isn't the

5 significance supposedly the existence or nonexistence of

6 our continuation of the jury panel, going back to Justice

7 Stevens' question? And what if the -- what if the State

8 had a procedure whereby the trial judge would simply

9 decline to discharge the jury panel if an appeal were

10 taken from the acquittal motion so that if he was tipped

11 over, it could come right back to the same jury panel?

12 Would -- would the -- would the answer have to be

13 different?

14 MS. NEAVES: I don't think it would.

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why?

16 MS. NEAVES: I think -- I think for a -- I think

17 for my -- to my way of thinking about the cases, the jury

18 is what matters and it's the defendant's right to his

19 particular tribunal, and that's the first jury that's

20 empaneled --

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but on my hypothesis he's

22 going to get the same jury.

23 MS. NEAVES: Exactly.

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: They have not been discharged.

25 MS. NEAVES: Exactly. So I would say that it

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 would not be a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause,

2 and that's why --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wow. It goes all the way up on

4 appeal and the jury -- I -- I don't know what the -- I

5 guess he lets the jury go home for a couple of months or

6 while the appeal is pending and then when the decision is

7 overturned by the court of appeals, he comes back and

8 recommences the trial? Wow.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. If that's so, then

10 why shouldn't Smalis have gone the other way? Because

11 they can send it right back to exactly the same judge.

12 MS. NEAVES: Because he -- he is the trier of

13 fact, and I think at that point --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the jury is the trier of

15 fact.

16 MS. NEAVES: That's --

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, on the hypothesis

18 before, you're saying if they don't discharge the jury and

19 it can go back to them, no double jeopardy problem. In

20 Smalis, it's going to be the same judge. It was a bench

21 trial. It should have come out the other way.

22 MS. NEAVES: Well, I think the difference is the

23 -- the judge in Smalis was the trier of fact. He made a

24 rule -- he is both the trier of fact and the law-giver.

25 He's decided that the evidence is insufficient. If that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 case goes up on appeal, that is -- that is factual -- that

2 is oversight of his factual determination in essence.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it ordinarily true --

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is another -- is another

5 difference -- and I don't know if this -- is another

6 difference that in the hypothetical case with the jury,

7 the jury has not yet deliberated --

8 MS. NEAVES: Thank you. 


9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in order to consider the


10 facts.

11 MS. NEAVES: Yes.

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Whereas in your --

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- your case, the -- the judge

15 is -- is --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this?

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- apparently deliberating --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is it not true that in this --

19 MS. NEAVES: That's where I was headed.

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- in this case the judge did

21 not reconsider until the end of the defense case?

22 MS. NEAVES: That is correct, Justice Stevens.

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, during that period, did

24 the defense lawyer have the right to rely on the acquittal

25 in deciding whether or not to put in defensive evidence on

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the count from which he thought his client had been

2 acquitted?

3 MS. NEAVES: Well, he certainly had some sense

4 of reliance, but it wasn't a double jeopardy reliance.

5 And I would -- I would point the Court to --

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, if the Double

7 Jeopardy Clause did apply, if it were treated as a true

8 acquittal, he could just say, well, we can forget about

9 that, send your witnesses home, we won't have to worry

10 about it.

11 I understand under your view they could send the

12 witnesses home, and a week -- a week later the judge could

13 say, well, we haven't submitted it to the jury, I've

14 decided to change my mind. You could bring all those

15 witnesses back. That's the way you think it should work.

16 MS. NEAVES: Absolutely, Justice Stevens. And I

17 think --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what about a judge who

19 thinks -- should the judge -- should a judge in trial be

20 able to change his mind as long as the jury is still

21 there? Yes.

22 MS. NEAVES: Yes.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: Should you be able to take an

24 appeal in the same circumstance while the jury is still

25 there? No.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Now, suppose a judge thinks both those things.

2 Is that judge, like me, for example, hopelessly confused?

3 (Laughter.)

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Is the judge thinking

5 contradictory things or is there a way of reconciling

6 those two instincts?

7 MS. NEAVES: I -- Justice Breyer, I -- I

8 certainly believe that the -- that the double jeopardy

9 rule that we're -- we're advocating would permit that, but

10 I -- I think that most trial judges would not be very

11 pleased about doing something like that. And practically

12 speaking, there's --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: By the way, if it's

14 constitutional, it's pretty easy to see a State might well

15 say, let's do that, what a good idea. I mean, they might

16 think it's a good idea. I don't know what people think is

17 a good idea. We'll provide for interlocutory appeals

18 right in the middle of cases because the prosecution can

19 never appeal at the end of the case. That's really

20 unfair. And we'll do this little thing here, and that way

21 we give the prosecutor a chance.

22 MS. NEAVES: I -- I have to stick with the rule

23 that -- that --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. You think it's --

25 I'm just inconsistent.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. NEAVES: I think it -- I -- well, it's --

2 it's -- I think if -- I think if you accept the notion

3 that jury discharge is what matters for purposes of the

4 Double Jeopardy Clause and permitting a trial judge to

5 reconsider a legal ruling up to that point, then if a

6 State court could fashion an interlocutory review process

7 of that legal ruling, that would not violate the Double

8 Jeopardy Clause.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the conceptual basis

10 for saying that jury discharge makes the difference? Why

11 is that the touchstone?

12 MS. NEAVES: I think this Court has said over

13 and over again that it is the jury -- the defendant's

14 right to hold onto his chosen jury that matters in a

15 number of different contexts in the double jeopardy area.

16 This Court has drawn the line at attachment of jeopardy

17 when the jury is empaneled and sworn based on the

18 historical value of a defendant having that particular

19 jury resolve the government's case against him. And so I

20 think that it matters, particularly where a motion for a

21 required finding is not constitutionally mandated. It's a

22 tool that --

23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I would think prejudice to

24 the defendant should be a factor, and if the defendant is

25 misled by what the judge says into not putting on part of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the case that otherwise would have been put on, that's a

2 pretty serious matter.

3 MS. NEAVES: That is a very serious matter, and

4 it is the sort of prejudice that falls within the rubric

5 of due process and -- and --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but we usually don't use --

7 MS. NEAVES: -- would grant you a retrial.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- we don't use the -- I mean,

9 you could use the Due Process Clause for everything, for

10 double jeopardy, for all of the other protections in the

11 Constitution. I think our cases say if -- if there's a

12 problem that has been created by ignoring the double

13 jeopardy rules, you don't solve that problem by -- by the

14 deus ex machina of the Due Process Clause.

15 MS. NEAVES: No. That's -- that's exactly

16 correct.

17 JUSTICE BREYER: What about --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: So this a problem created by

19 the judge's dismissal, and which this defendant had every

20 reason to rely upon as being the end of that part of the

21 case. I'm inclined to say if -- if that is a problem, in

22 fairness it's a -- it's a double jeopardy problem, not a

23 due process problem.

24 MS. NEAVES: Well, with respect, Justice Scalia,

25 I would say it is the sort of reliance that a -- that a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 defendant may have, as for example the case in Sanabria,

2 where a -- where a judge excludes certain evidence, and

3 the case goes forward. And as a result of that -- a

4 result of that decision, the judge in that case granted a

5 motion for acquittal. And at the end of the case, the

6 prosecution asked for reconsideration of the exclusion of

7 the evidence, and the judge ultimately determined not to

8 go ahead and let that evidence back in, but specifically

9 said if I had let it back in, I would have vacated my

10 motion for required finding and allowed the case to go to

11 the jury. So that sort of prejudice -- a defendant has an

12 expectation of certain things that may or may not happen

13 at trial, but the remedy outside of the double jeopardy

14 context, if the defendant is acquitted, is a retrial.

15 The drastic remedy of double jeopardy is -- is

16 used when a defendant has been subjected twice to a trial

17 before a second trier of fact. This -- this Court has

18 been consistent that when the government subjects the

19 defendant over and over again before a second --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand you correctly

21 to say that if the defendant is acquitted, the remedy is a

22 retrial?

23 MS. NEAVES: No, no, no. I'm sorry, Justice

24 Stevens. No. Only if the defendant is convicted is the

25 remedy a retrial because, indeed, if the jury acquits him,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there is no harm at all.

2 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the reason you didn't

3 want a fairly simple rule that I was thinking of? I'll

4 tell you what it is and you'll tell me honestly why you

5 don't.

6 It's final. The word acquittal is -- is final

7 if the jury has been discharged or the decision is sent to

8 another body for review. One or the other.

9 MS. NEAVES: I could live with that rule.

10 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, so you haven't found

11 something in your research that suggests that -- that --

12 MS. NEAVES: No, no. Our position has been

13 consistent.

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under -- under that view

15 of things, suppose in this -- in this case there's a

16 motion for acquittal and the judge says, yes, I -- I think

17 there's no evidence on the gun. Then the prosecutor says

18 I want 10 minutes because I think there's a case on it.

19 Then he says, you know, there's a case and I think it

20 covers this, and the judge says, well, I think you may be

21 wrong. I'll let you reopen to put on evidence of -- of

22 the gun. What would -- what would be the result in that

23 case?

24 MS. NEAVES: I think that because if it's a jury

25 trial and the case is still -- and the jury is still

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there, it could be done without violating the Double

2 Jeopardy Clause.

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think you have to say that

4 under your view.

5 MS. NEAVES: I think so. I think honing -- what

6 this Court has talked about in honing is -- is refining a

7 case before a second trier of fact. And as a matter of

8 Massachusetts' procedures, certainly the prosecution may

9 be able to reopen if there's good faith or mistake, but

10 for purposes of --

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why did the

12 Massachusetts Supreme Court say -- and I thought it did

13 say this in its rules -- trial judge, you rule on the spot

14 when a motion to acquit is made? We will not allow you to

15 reserve judgment. Because the normal thing would be a

16 trial judge would say, why should I decide this

17 definitively now? I'll wait till the end of the case.

18 But as I understand the Massachusetts rules, it says,

19 judge, you can't reserve on a motion to acquit. You must

20 rule immediately.

21 MS. NEAVES: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg,

22 and if I misunderstood the hypothetical, that -- that was

23 my mistake. As a matter of Massachusetts law, a trial

24 judge does not have that option. She must rule on the

25 motion before the defendant decides to put on the case,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and that is what happened here.

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so part of Justice

3 Breyer's question needs editing because it would not be

4 possible under Massachusetts law for the judge to say --

5 MS. NEAVES: That is correct.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I reserve.

7 MS. NEAVES: That is correct. She could not.

8 And -- and if I could just highlight a couple of

9 points to -- to demonstrate the significance of -- of

10 permitting trial judges the ability to reconsider legal

11 rulings. In Massachusetts, the fact that there's a

12 written motion here is quite unusual. These motions are

13 made orally generally. The prosecution is not given an

14 opportunity -- does not -- there's no requirement that he

15 be given advance notice ever. There's no requirement of

16 that. The prosecution argues in opposition to the motion

17 on the spot, and the judge rules on the spot.

18 And -- and I think that -- that procedure is

19 demonstrated quite clearly here. The -- the defendant

20 filed the motion. The prosecution did, indeed, argue the

21 correct response, legal response, did not have a case at

22 hand and as --

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Your position would be the same

24 if the -- if the Massachusetts law provided that the

25 motions at the end of the prosecution's case shall not be

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 ruled on unless -- after they're written briefs filed by

2 both sides and they have 3 days of argument. You'd still

3 have the same position.

4 MS. NEAVES: That's true.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: And in fact, the -- the quick

6 and dirty procedure you describe is probably a boon to

7 prosecutors because a judge is -- is not likely to take

8 the serious step of dismissing a charge on the basis of --

9 of such a procedure and is more likely to say, well, we'll

10 let the trial go ahead and see what the evidence

11 discloses. I mean, I can't imagine that this is not a

12 boon to the prosecutor rather than, as you -- as you seem

13 to paint it here, a disadvantage.

14 MS. NEAVES: I -- I wouldn't want to

15 characterize --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is a very unusual judge I

17 would think to --

18 MS. NEAVES: Yes.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to whip it out like that and

20 -- and enter an acquittal without -- without letting it go

21 forward.

22 MS. NEAVES: I would say it is unusual, but it

23 happens where -- and I think the trial judge certainly in

24 this case who believes that if she's mistaken, can -- can

25 correct her ruling and send it to the jury, then feels

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 somewhat free to -- to do what the defendant asks, if it

2 seems reasonable, and -- and knows that if -- if it can be

3 corrected --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: You may -- you may regret what

5 you've asked for.

6 MS. NEAVES: I hope not, Justice Scalia. I hope

7 not.

8 I think --

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would happen -- I think

10 one of the briefs suggested that suppose you have a multi-

11 defendant case and the judge says, after the prosecution

12 case is done, defendant A, I'm going to grant a motion to

13 acquit. He's out of it, but there was enough evidence to

14 require the -- the defense to go on for B and C. And then

15 after hearing B and C's defense, the judge said, I think I

16 was wrong about acquitting A, so I'm -- I'm going to

17 withdraw it. Would there be -- could that be done without

18 any -- any double jeopardy bar? The jury hasn't been

19 discharged.

20 MS. NEAVES: Justice Ginsburg, I don't think it

21 presents a double jeopardy bar, but a defendant has a

22 right to be present at his trial, and so it certainly

23 would be a reversible error if -- if a trial judge --

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the -- the -- he's

25 sitting there. Defendant A is sitting there throughout

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the whole trial.

2 MS. NEAVES: Then there's certainly no double

3 jeopardy bar to that.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: There could be a problem that

5 you have to have a fair chance to present evidence and so

6 forth.

7 MS. NEAVES: Absolutely, Justice Breyer, and --

8 and --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: I guess there are a lot of

10 rules in Massachusetts that deal with that. They can't --

11 you have to be fair to the defendant in -- is that right?

12 MS. NEAVES: Well, certainly. Rule 25 itself

13 specifically states that the defendant shall have the

14 opportunity to present evidence after the motion is denied

15 or allowed in part without reserving that right. So

16 certainly that option is available.

17 Unless the Court has further questions.

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Neaves.

19 MS. NEAVES: Thank you.

22 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

23 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

24 MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

25 may it please the Court:

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 The trial court in this case was permitted to

2 correct its erroneous ruling in favor of the defendant on

3 the motion for judgment of acquittal. Because the

4 prosecution is entitled to a full and fair opportunity to

5 prove its case, that's a value --

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you the same

7 question I asked your -- your colleague? Supposing we're

8 not in Massachusetts, but we're in another State that

9 provided for an interlocutory appeal immediately after the

10 judge's ruling in this case. Would -- would you have the

11 same appraisal of the case on those facts?

12 MR. SRINIVASAN: Would we have the same

13 appraisal as the State? We don't --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. Would you still say it

15 was not final, even though it was sufficiently final for

16 appellate purposes?

17 MR. SRINIVASAN: No. We -- we think that the

18 Court's holding in Smalis applies equally to jury trials

19 and to bench trials such that an appeal, an interlocutory

20 appeal, in the midst of a jury trial would not be

21 permissible. But we also think that there is a sound

22 basis for drawing a distinction between --

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: But my question is assuming a

24 State procedure in which the interlocutory appeal was

25 permissible, you -- you would say Double Jeopardy Clause

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 would bar that appeal.

2 MR. SRINIVASAN: Right, because we read that to

3 be the holding of Smalis.

4 But we think there's a basis for distinguishing

5 between appeals on one hand and continuing proceedings

6 before the initial tribunal on the other hand. First of

7 all, this Court has drawn that distinction in Swisher v.

8 Brady where it initially said that the two-stage system of

9 adjudication is -- in Maryland that was at issue in that

10 case was permissible because it entailed continued

11 proceedings before the initial tribunal rather than an

12 appeal to a second tribunal. And the Court specifically

13 distinguished its prior decisions in Jenkins v. the United

14 States and Kepner, both of which involved appellate

15 review.

16 And the other basis for drawing a distinction

17 between appeals on one hand and reconsiderations by the

18 trial court on the other is historical tradition. I think

19 the Court could look to history and history would show

20 that on one hand trial courts have always had inherent

21 authority to reconsider their mid-trial rulings because

22 the practical exigencies of trial are such that trial

23 courts inevitably will err on occasion, and the ends of

24 justice require trial courts to have the authority to

25 revisit their mid-trial rulings.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would -- would you allow a

2 trial judge to reopen -- to -- to permit the prosecution

3 to reopen the case?

4 MR. SRINIVASAN: We would, Justice Kennedy, but

5 it raises a distinct problem because one value that's

6 served by the Double Jeopardy Clause is the defendant's

7 interest in preventing the prosecution from honing its

8 evidentiary case by repeated efforts. And if the trial

9 judge were permitted to reopen the case to give the

10 prosecution that opportunity, it at least would implicate

11 that interest.

12 Now, we still think that the proper line is jury

13 discharge, but we understand that that hypothetical would

14 present a distinct interest.

15 Now, with respect to historical tradition on

16 appeals, the historical tradition is clear that the

17 government has lacked authority at common law to take an

18 appeal in a criminal proceeding. This Court relied on

19 that common law tradition as early as Sanges v. the United

20 States and it's repeated that understanding in Carroll v.

21 the United States and Arizona v. Manypenny, and that's why

22 the Court construes statutory grants of authority to the

23 government to take an appeal in criminal cases quite

24 narrowly. And so I think the Court could draw a

25 distinction between reconsiderations by the trial court

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and appeals by looking to historical tradition, and the

2 Court often looks at history to shape the contours of

3 double jeopardy protections. And that would afford the

4 case -- the Court a basis for saying that in Smalis, while

5 appeals were forbidden, in this case trial court

6 reconsideration should be permitted.

7 And I think the lens through which the Court

8 would do that under the Double Jeopardy Clause is the

9 valued interest in giving the prosecution one full and

10 fair opportunity to prove its case in the sense that while

11 that full and fair opportunity may exclude an appeal,

12 because the Court held as much in Smalis, it doesn't

13 exclude reconsiderations.

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why doesn't the -- the

15 prosecution gets its full and fair opportunity if we have

16 a rule that says to trial judges, when you make a ruling

17 on acquittal, you better be serious and you better not

18 make a snap judgment, think it over, because once you've

19 done it, it sticks? Why -- why doesn't the prosecution

20 have a perfectly fair opportunity under that rule?

21 Everybody knows where he stands and judges, we hope, are

22 going to be careful.

23 MR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Souter, we think a

24 constitutional rule that would turn on the definitiveness

25 of a trial court ruling would be flawed in three respects.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 First, the line between a definitive ruling and

2 a tentative ruling is not altogether clear, and we've

3 outlined in our brief at page 24 in a lengthy footnote a

4 variety of factual scenarios that come from real cases

5 where trial judges, as they often do, rendered a ruling on

6 a motion for acquittal orally, and whether you think that

7 ruling was definitive or tentative might depend on which

8 page of the transcript you happen to be looking at.

9 But even if we're dealing with a situation in

10 which the ruling clearly falls on the definitive side of

11 the line, you'd still have the problem that a trial court

12 might be convinced that it's correct and rule definitively

13 but still be incorrect. Trial courts make mistakes.

14 That's why this issue comes up as often as it does. For

15 example, in this case --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: All these cases -- we've

17 had several, not too many over the -- the whole line of

18 cases -- and the trial judge has always committed a rather

19 plain error. And we all have the case where if you just

20 try to decide whether it's a just result, you'd always say

21 no. A case just like this. The judge made a mistake, but

22 we've always said that's not something we -- we look at.

23 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't -- I'm not quite sure

24 I'm following what you're saying, Justice Stevens,

25 because --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: I say as a typical matter

2 these double jeopardy claims arise in cases in which the

3 judge made a rather plain error, and when you look at it

4 later, you say, gee, he goofed. And so I'm not sure we

5 should consider the plainness of the error or the fact

6 that they -- they do mistakes because they do.

7 MR. SRINIVASAN: But -- but I don't -- but the

8 reason why the Court accepts errors in some situations is

9 because there's some other value under the Double Jeopardy

10 Clause.

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: The value of finality is what

12 is really at stake here.

13 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it's not just the value

14 of finality. It's that, for example, if the judge makes

15 an error and then the jury is discharged, it's the value

16 that the defendant has in obtaining a result from the

17 particular tribunal. In the circumstances of this case,

18 where the trial judge can correct her error within the --

19 within a matter of minutes, at least in some situations,

20 there would be no double jeopardy purpose served --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: But here it was not a matter

22 of minutes.

23 MR. SRINIVASAN: In this --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Here it was --

25 MR. SRINIVASAN: No. I acknowledge in this case

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it wasn't, but it might well be in some cases. For

2 example, we cite a decision of the Washington Supreme

3 Court, State v. Collins, which involves essentially the

4 same scenario as this case, but the only distinction was

5 that after the trial judge initially announced her ruling,

6 the prosecution had the precedent in hand and within a

7 span of 10 minutes, the trial judge was able to realize

8 her error and to correct her ruling and reinstate the

9 charge.

10 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does it matter if the -- if

11 the ruling is conveyed to the jury even though the jury

12 isn't discharged?

13 MR. SRINIVASAN: It would matter, Justice

14 O'Connor, but I don't think it would necessarily preclude

15 the prosecution from going forward on the charge under the

16 Double Jeopardy Clause. The question would be one of due

17 process and prejudice to the defendant.

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You had three -- three reasons

19 you were going to give Justice Souter. One is it's not

20 clear always that it's definitive. The other is that

21 trial judges do make mistakes, and the third is?

22 MR. SRINIVASAN: And the third is -- it's an

23 issue that you raised earlier, Justice Kennedy. It's that

24 this case might look different as an atmospheric matter if

25 the trial judge at the time she rendered her ruling had

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 said, I'm ruling in the defendant's favor, but I may

2 reconsider this decision at a later point in the

3 proceedings. Now, that might be seen to fall on the

4 tentative side of the line, but that's exactly the effect

5 of this -- of the trial judge's ruling as a matter of

6 Massachusetts law. And we don't think there's a

7 constitutionally significant distinction between a trial

8 judge explicitly saying that a ruling can be reconsidered

9 and State law saying that the ruling can be reconsidered.

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't the distinction the

11 right to rely?

12 MR. SRINIVASAN: It -- there -- there -- that

13 would be the basis of a claim, Justice Souter, but the

14 right to rely is, in essence, a notice prejudice sort of

15 claim and that could be handled in the way that trial

16 courts typically handle claims by the defendant that

17 they've detrimentally relied on an initial ruling the

18 trial court has subsequently reconsidered.

19 It would be equally the case, for example, as

20 the State mentioned with respect to an evidentiary ruling

21 that barred the prosecution from introducing a category of

22 evidence, but then the trial judge, later in the

23 proceedings, wanted to revisit that ruling. The question

24 would be whether revisiting the ruling resulted in

25 prejudice to the defendant because the defendant had

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 detrimentally relied on the trial judge's initial

2 determination. And we don't think that prejudice inquiry

3 is meaningfully different when you're dealing with

4 evidentiary rulings as when you're -- as when you're

5 dealing with the reinstatement of a previously acquitted

6 charge.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why shouldn't you have

8 -- what's magic about the jury? Why shouldn't you have

9 the same rule on a bench trial? A judge in a bench trial

10 makes a ruling, thinks about it, and says, you know, I

11 shouldn't have ruled that way. Why shouldn't that judge

12 be able to change? Just because there's no jury to

13 discharge.

14 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it would depend. If --

15 if the bench trial judge were making a mid-trial ruling,

16 as -- as in this case, then the judge could change his or

17 her mind. But if the bench trial judge were resolving the

18 entire case and entered --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is the line? I

20 mean, is there -- there no point at which he can't change?

21 I mean --

22 MR. SRINIVASAN: No. The -- the -- I think the

23 Constitution would step in and impose a line at some

24 point, and probably the best indicator is a rule --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not dismissal of the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 jury. We'll have to make up some other line. Right?

2 MR. SRINIVASAN: It can't be discharge of the

3 jury, but I think where the Court would look, first and

4 foremost, in defining a line for bench trials, if the

5 issue would ever arise, would be a ruling that would

6 essentially have resulted in discharge of the jury if the

7 trial were before a jury. And for example, the Federal

8 Rules of Criminal Procedure --

9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But how do we -- how does

10 Smalis fit into this discussion? I thought in Smalis in a

11 bench trial, we said it was final.

12 MR. SRINIVASAN: It was, Justice O'Connor, for

13 purposes of an appeal, and that's why I think the critical

14 distinction between Smalis and this case is that where the

15 prosecution might not have authority to take an appeal

16 from a ruling on the insufficiency of the evidence.

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your line would be something

18 like if it -- if -- from all of the transcript, it appears

19 that the judge is -- is giving consideration to the entire

20 case or something like that in a bench trial.

21 MR. SRINIVASAN: In a bench trial, that -- that

22 would be part of the inquiry, Justice Kennedy, and I would

23 also point, by the way, to -- can I just finish the

24 thought, Justice Stevens? To Federal Rule of Criminal

25 Procedure 32(k)(1), which says that when a bench trial --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 when a judge sitting in a bench trial issues a ruling that

2 finds a defendant not guilty, that ruling will discharge

3 the defendant. And I think a discharge of the defendant

4 would be one of critical consideration.

5 Thank you.

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.

7 Mr. Nathanson, you have about 3 minutes left.

8 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. NATHANSON

9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10 MR. NATHANSON: Justice Stevens, may it please

11 the Court:

12 I'll try to be as brief as I can.

13 The argument about inherent authority to

14 reconsider an acquittal really has it backwards. Inherent

15 authority bends to the Constitution. The Constitution

16 does not bend to a judge's inherent authority.

17 Second, the -- the Government is trying to

18 substitute a standard here of a second proceeding, which

19 is not this Court's standard. This Court's standard is

20 further proceedings after an acquittal, including

21 resumption of the same trial. That's what this Court said

22 in Smalis.

23 The Government is also trying to move this case

24 into the particular tribunal analysis. That comes from

25 cases that are mistrials. This is an acquittal. This is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 not a particular tribunal case.

2 As to the judge resolving all the issues in a

3 bench trial and -- and that's why that -- that acquittal

4 would be more final than a motion for a directed verdict,

5 it was a motion for a directed verdict. It was a demurrer

6 in Smalis. It was the exact same standard that the judge

7 applied in that case.

8 As to prejudice, prejudice has never been a

9 factor in this Court's double jeopardy analysis. As a

10 matter of fact, in -- in one of the really classical

11 statements, Ex parte Lange, if you look at the facts of

12 that case, that looks like complete gamesmanship. The

13 defendant was sentenced to a jail term and a fine when the

14 -- the statute only authorized a jail term or a fine. He

15 said, oh, I'll pay -- I'll pay the fine. It's a get-out-

16 of-jail-free card. There's complete gamesmanship, but

17 prejudice was not a factor. And in fact, this Court has

18 said prejudice is not open to judicial examination in

19 double jeopardy cases.

20 As to honing, in -- in fact, in Rumsey --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Honing?

22 MR. NATHANSON: Honing. Not the name of a case,

23 Your Honor. But whether or not the Government has honed

24 its cased through -- and -- and they would say evidentiary

25 honing. But it's not evidentiary honing. In Rumsey, it

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 was only argument that was presented at -- at the remand

2 after acquittal.

3 Justice Souter, I want to heartily endorse the

4 -- the way you phrased what the rule should be, which is,

5 trial judges, you ought to take this seriously.

6 Pretermitting the prosecution's case is a very serious

7 matter. You cannot take it back. So think about it. Do

8 it right the first time.

9 As to -- to rule 25 itself, it's true that the

10 -- the judges can't reserve. So what they do as -- as a

11 matter of practice in Massachusetts is they simply deny,

12 and -- and they deny the first one and they have two more

13 opportunities, one at the close of the defendant's case

14 and they have an opportunity at the close of -- after the

15 jury has returned a verdict. At each of those steps, they

16 can make a motion for acquittal.

17 As to the full and fair opportunity, this Court

18 said in Martin Linen that the Government has a right to

19 try the case. They do not have a right to have it proceed

20 to verdict. I'm just taking that straight from Martin

21 Linen.

22 As to, finally, whether or not State law sort of

23 insulates this from Federal -- I see my time is up. Thank

24 you.

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Nathanson, thank you.
