1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:05 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument now 4 in No. 02-1183, the United States v. Samuel Francis 5 Patane. 6 Mr. Dreeben. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 Before this Court's decision in Dickerson v. 12 United States in the year 2000, it was the uniform rule in 13 the lower Federal courts that the failure to issue Miranda 14 warnings meant that the unwarned statement was not 15 admissible in the Government's case, but that there was no 16 requirement to suppress physical evidence that was derived 17 from those unwarned statements. 18 Following this Court's decision in Dickerson, 19 which affirmed that Miranda has constitutional stature, 20 the majority of the Federal courts of appeals to address 21 the issue continued to adhere to the pre-Dickerson rule 22 that physical fruits of an unwarned statement were 23 admissible. 24 In this case, the Tenth Circuit broke ranks with 25 that uniform body of authority and held that, as a result
3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 of Dickerson's ruling that Miranda has constitutional 2 stature, there is a derivative fruits suppression 3 component to the Miranda rule. That holding should be 4 reversed. 5 Miranda stands as a rule that implements the 6 Fifth Amendment, not by requiring the compulsion that the 7 Amendment literally speaks of, but by providing an extra 8 level of protection for the core of the Fifth Amendment 9 right, the right for the defendant's own statements that 10 are incriminating not to be used against him in a criminal 11 trial. 12 QUESTION: Is it a Fifth Amendment right or not a 13 Fifth Amendment right? 14 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, as I understand it, 15 it is a right that implements the Fifth Amendment's 16 protection. 17 QUESTION: It - it has to be based on something 18 in the Constitution or we would have had to respect the 19 statute enacted by Congress in Dickerson. So it is 20 there is obviously some provision of the Constitution that 21 enabled us to disregard that statute. What - what 22 provision is that? 23 MR. DREEBEN: The Fifth Amendment. What the 24 QUESTION: All right. It's a Fifth Amendment 25 right then.

1 MR. DREEBEN: What the Court concluded in Miranda 2 and then reaffirmed in Dickerson is that the traditional 3 totality of the circumstances test for ascertaining 4 whether a statement is voluntary or has been compelled by 5 the Government is not adequate when the statements are 6 taken in the inherently pressuring environment of 7 custodial interrogation. And to provide an extra layer of 8 protection to avoid the violation of the defendant's Fifth 9 Amendment rights, the Court adopted a prophylactic 10 warnings and wavier procedure. 11 QUESTION: Whether it's prophylactic or not, it 12 is a constitutional right, is it not? It is a 13 constitutional right. 14 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, it is a 15 constitutional right that is distinct from the right not 16 to have one's compelled statements used against oneself. 17 QUESTION: Well, so is the constitutional right 18 not to be pistol-whipped in order to - to confess. 19 MR. DREEBEN: Well 20 QUESTION: That's distinct from the introduction 21 of the coerced confession at trial, but we don't 22 distinguish between the two, do we? 23 MR. DREEBEN: Oh, I think you do, Justice Scalia. 24 That is a violation of the core due process right not to 25 have substantive violations of one's liberty interests.

1 What we're talking about in this case is not a substantive 2 violation of the defendant's rights, but a procedural 3 violation of the Fifth Amendment that this Court has 4 defined in Miranda, but has defined it in a way that is 5 highly distinct from the basic, textually-mandated rule of 6 the Fifth Amendment that compelled statements may not be 7 used. 8 QUESTION: Let me - let me take out the pistol9 whipping. It - it - it is a coerced statement because of 10 the application of mental coercion. Now, that is not a 11 violation of the Fifth Amendment, I suppose, until the 12 product of the - of the coercion is introduced at trial. 13 Will you say the same thing? 14 MR. DREEBEN: I would - I'm not sure, Justice 15 Scalia, that your question addresses what Miranda 16 addressed. What Miranda addressed was a situation in 17 which it was extremely difficult for the courts to sort 18 out whether a statement was coerced or not coerced, and to 19 avoid the risk that an actually coerced statement would be 20 used in evidence against the defendant, thus violating the 21 core Fifth Amendment right. The Miranda Court, as this 22 Court has later explained, adopted a presumption, a 23 presumption for a limited purpose. In the government 24 QUESTION: May - may I ask a - a modified version 25 of Justice Scalia's question? Supposing that the
6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Government used official powers, such as a grand jury 2 subpoena or a congressional committee subpoena, to - to 3 get a confession out of a person under threat of contempt 4 of court, so it was clearly just a Fifth Amendment was a 5 he made an answer that revealed the existence of the gun 6 and then he - would that be a - would the gun be 7 admissible or un - inadmissible in that scenario? 8 MR. DREEBEN: If your hypothetical, Justice 9 Stevens, presupposes an assertion of the Fifth Amendment 10 right and actual compulsion of the 11 QUESTION: The threat of contempt, yeah. 12 MR. DREEBEN: - information, presumably under a 13 grant of immunity, then the gun would not be admissible, 14 because this Court has defined a violation of the Fifth 15 Amendment that involves actual compulsion as entailing two 16 different evidentiary consequences. One evidentiary 17 consequence is that the statements themselves may not be 18 used. The other evidentiary consequence is that nothing 19 derived from the statements may be used. But the critical 20 feature of that hypothetical and its distinction from 21 Miranda, is it involves actual compulsion. Miranda 22 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben - Mr. - Miranda itself 23 said, but unless and until such warnings and waivers are 24 demonstrated by the prosecution at trial, no evidence 25 obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against
7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 him, no evidence as a result of interrogation. That 2 sounds like a - a - a derivative evidence rule to me. 3 MR. DREEBEN: It does, Justice Ginsburg, and 4 there are many things in the Miranda opinion that have not 5 stood the test of later litigation in this Court, because 6 they extended the implications of Miranda far beyond where 7 this Court has gone. And let me be precise about this. 8 The rule, at the time of Miranda and today, is that if 9 there is actual compulsion, the Government may not make 10 use of the actual statements that are taken or their 11 evidentiary fruits. The Government may also not use that 12 statement for impeachment, and there is no public safety 13 exception that could 14 QUESTION: Well, how are we going to determine 15 actual compulsion if it's a situation where the police 16 knowingly engage in conversation hoping to pick up 17 information without giving the Miranda warnings, and then 18 the minute they start hearing something useful, give the 19 warnings, but then rely on what they learned earlier to 20 further that information gathering. How - how do we parse 21 that out? 22 MR. DREEBEN: Justice O'Connor, the determination 23 of whether the statements reflect voluntariness at the 24 outset and then a knowing and - and intelligent waiver of 25 Miranda warnings later on after they are given needs to be
8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 determined based on the totality of the circumstances. 2 But this Court has recognized, in allowing the 3 use of unwarned statements for impeachment and in adopting 4 the public safety exception, and in permitting a second 5 warned statement, as the Court did in Oregon v. Elstad, to 6 be admitted into evidence, notwithstanding an earlier 7 unwarned statement, that there is a difference between the 8 Miranda presumption and a finding of actual compulsion. 9 QUESTION: May I ask you - you mentioned the 10 public safety exception. We wouldn't - we really don't 11 need a public safety exception if you're correct in this 12 case, do we? 13 MR. DREEBEN: No, we still do, because the 14 crucial thing about Miranda that is not challenged here is 15 that a failure to issue Miranda warnings, followed by 16 custodial interrogation, means that the unwarned statement 17 is inadmissible in the Government's case in chief. That 18 is the core ruling of Miranda. 19 QUESTION: But the core ruling of the public 20 safety exception, as I remember it, is that you can use 21 the gun. 22 MR. DREEBEN: No, the core ruling of the public 23 safety exception is that you can use the statement. The 24 Court held, in New York v. Quarles, that when pressing 25 public safety needs justify the conduct of custodial
9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 interrogation without prior issuance of Miranda warnings, 2 that situation falls outside of the Miranda paradigm, and 3 the statements themselves can be used. 4 Now, Justice O'Connor's dissenting opinion 5 argued that there should be no exception for public safety 6 for the statements themselves, but the gun, as derivative 7 evidence, should come in, because it was not the product 8 of actual compulsion at which the Fifth Amendment is 9 aimed. 10 QUESTION: Mr. 11 QUESTION: The - the difficulty that I have 12 accepting that as the final answer is that there isn't any 13 functional difference in a case like this between 14 admitting the statement, the admission that he had the gun 15 on the shelf in the bedroom, and admitting the gun. So 16 that, in functional terms, the - the Miranda protection, 17 even as you describe it, disappears on your theory. 18 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, if - if I accept 19 that that accurately describes this case, it does not 20 accurately describe the large class of cases in which 21 physical evidence is discovered as a result of unwarned 22 statements. In many 23 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, doesn't it occur - cover 24 quite a wide number of cases? This was a case where the 25 the crime that the police were after were - was gun
10

1 possession. It might be narcotics possession, it might be 2 stolen goods. And in all those situations, are you saying 3 that the constitutional rule is that a police chief can 4 say to his officers, go in and get him to tell you where 5 the narcotics are, where the gun is, where the stolen 6 goods are? We don't worry about his statement, but we 7 want the goods. 8 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, that is my 9 position, but I don't think it would be a prudent policy 10 for law enforcement to adopt. This case may be one in 11 which the Government can prove knowing possession of a 12 firearm by the defendant even without the benefit of his 13 statements, but police officers are not going to be able 14 to predict in advance that that is going to be true in the 15 vast majority of cases. What they are going to know is 16 that if you have a statement that links the defendant to 17 the gun, that allows you to show knowing possession. In 18 the absence of that, having the physical evidence alone 19 will not necessarily guarantee a conviction. 20 QUESTION: You don't think the gun on the shelf 21 in the guy's bedroom is going to be sufficient to prove 22 knowing possession? 23 MR. DREEBEN: Oh, I do in this case, Justice 24 Souter. 25 QUESTION: You know what's in your bedroom.

1 MR. DREEBEN: I think that the Court should 2 decide this case not based on the particularities of this 3 factual scenario, but on the class of cases in which 4 physical evidence is at issue, and should regard the 5 question of what incentives the police may have as 6 informed by the totality of cases that may arise. 7 Police officers who decide to conduct custodial 8 interrogation without giving Miranda warnings know that 9 they will not be able to use the statements that the 10 defendant makes in the Government's case in chief, and 11 they have no way of knowing before they conduct custodial 12 interrogation what the defendant may say. If the 13 defendant offers up information that is incriminating on 14 unanticipated crimes or provides leads to information that 15 the police haven't previously anticipated, then the police 16 officers run two risks. 17 The first is that they won't be able to use 18 those statements against the defendant in the case in 19 chief. The second is that by failing to issue Miranda 20 warnings, they increase the likelihood that a later court 21 reviewing the facts will conclude that this is not a case 22 of a mere failure to give Miranda warnings, but is a case 23 involving actual compulsion. And if a court concludes 24 that the statements are actually compelled, involuntary 25 QUESTION: Well, Mr. Dreeben, supposing that the
12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 police decide that they're going to follow this strategy 2 that is perhaps suggested by Justice Ginsburg. Would that 3 itself be evidence of compulsion? In other words, they 4 won't give Miranda warnings and see - see what the person 5 says, then they give them. Would that be evidence of 6 compulsion? 7 MR. DREEBEN: It would be evidence that a 8 defendant could argue is relevant, but I don't think that 9 it would be evidence of compulsion. What's relevant in 10 the compulsion analysis is what the police officers 11 actually say and do and communicate to the suspect. Their 12 uncommunicated intent or law enforcement policies would 13 not add up to compulsion by itself. 14 QUESTION: If we were to reject your position and 15 - and say that this is purely a constitutional violation, 16 would you then lose the case? 17 MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Kennedy. The Court 18 should still do as it has done in other contexts, balance 19 the costs of a Miranda suppression remedy against whatever 20 incremental benefits there may have. 21 QUESTION: What's your 22 QUESTION: And why - why is this different than 23 the rule under the Fourth Amendment, say Wong Sun? 24 MR. DREEBEN: What the Court has done in the 25 Fourth Amendment context is deal with an actual violation
13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 of the Fourth Amendment and establish very exclusion 2 various exclusionary rules that are designed to deter that 3 kind of police conduct. The Miranda rule is very 4 different, because even if the Court holds that Miranda 5 prescribes a rule of substantive conduct for the police, 6 which we submit it does not, even if the Court were to 7 hold that, it still is a rule that merely presumes 8 compulsion. It doesn't constitute a finding of actual 9 compulsion. 10 QUESTION: Well, we said last year in Chavez that 11 the Miranda - that the Constitution was not violated by 12 failure to give Miranda warnings until they were offered 13 in evidence, didn't we? 14 MR. DREEBEN: That - that is correct, Mr. Chief 15 Justice. But what the Court has done under the Fifth 16 Amendment 17 QUESTION: Is it correct, was there a majority to 18 take that position? 19 QUESTION: That was the trial court's opinion, 20 wasn't it? 21 QUESTION: That - that - I believe to - you're 22 taking all the opinions together. There were six votes 23 for that. 24 MR. DREEBEN: I think this Court will be better 25 able than I am to say what Chavez held.

1 (Laughter.) 2 MR. DREEBEN: But the - the reason that that 3 principle alone does not decide this case is that the 4 Court has, in instances of actual compulsion out of court, 5 applied a derivative evidence suppression rule. That's 6 the rule that the Court adopted in Counselman v. 7 Hitchcock, and it's followed it in its immunity line of 8 cases where it has held that to displace the Fifth 9 Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination, you 10 need to suppress both the statement and the fruits. 11 QUESTION: Is part of your - is - is part of your 12 reasoning that in the Fourth Amendment violation case, 13 exclusion is the - really the best available, most direct 14 remedy? And in - and in this case, there are other 15 remedies, number one, excluding the statement, so that 16 when you - when you find tangible evidence, it's - it's 17 just a - an ancillary and less necessary remedy. Is that 18 the whole 19 MR. DREEBEN: That - that's 20 QUESTION: - thrust of the argument. 21 MR. DREEBEN: That's the core of it, Justice 22 Kennedy. What the Court did in Miranda was create a rule 23 that operates in the very heart of the Fifth Amendment by 24 creating a prophylactic buffer zone against the risk, not 25 the certainty, but the risk, that actual compulsion has
15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 been exacted. It is that risk that the Fifth Amendment 2 targets as the core concern. 3 QUESTION: What's the theory of the compulsion? 4 That is, what - why, assuming that there's compulsion but 5 there hasn't been an introduction of the statement that 6 was compelled into evidence. Under that - and suppose 7 that the compulsion doesn't rise to the level of the due 8 process violation. I mean, I - maybe - maybe they all do, 9 but - but if they don't, then what's the theory of keeping 10 out the evidence derived from that sort of compulsion. 11 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, as the Court 12 explained it in its immunity line of cases, the starting 13 point of analysis is that a defendant under the Fifth 14 Amendment can claim his privilege against testifying based 15 not only on incrimination from the statements that he 16 makes, but also that evidence that the Government can 17 obtain as a result of the statements is incriminating. 18 If his testimony is a link in a chain of 19 incrimination, he can stand silent, and the Court reasoned 20 from that that the Government should not be able to 21 circumvent that right of the defendant not to be a witness 22 against his - himself, by calling him out of court, 23 compelling testimony over his objection that - based on 24 the Fifth Amendment, and then obtaining the very 25 incriminating information that the privilege shielded him
16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 from having to provide. 2 QUESTION: So why doesn't all that apply here? I 3 mean, is - is that - I can understand it if they compel 4 the testimony, then you introduce it. Then - then you 5 have the completed violation of what the Fifth Amendment 6 forbids, all right, the completed violation. I can 7 understand it if you compel the person to the extent that 8 it violates the Due Process Clause, beating him up 9 severely, whatever. 10 Now, I don't understand why, if you have neither 11 of those two things, you would keep the evidence that's 12 the fruits out, under some theory that doesn't also say 13 you should keep this out. 14 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the - the distinction between 15 this situation and the true compulsion situation is, 16 Miranda does not involve an actual finding of compulsion, 17 and the Court has been very frank about this. As a 18 result, the Court has repeatedly drawn distinctions 19 between the use of unwarned statements and the use of 20 actually compelled statements. Actually compelled 21 statements may not be used to impeach a defendant's trial 22 testimony. That too would violate the Fifth Amendment 23 right. 24 But the Court held in - in the Hass case and in 25 the Harris case that statements that are merely unwarned,
17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 but not compelled, can be used for impeachment. The Court 2 similarly held in Michigan v. Tucker and then again in 3 Oregon v. Elstad that statements that are unwarned, but 4 not compelled, can be used as leads to find another 5 witness' testimony, or to obtain a second statement from 6 the defendant himself. And if 7 QUESTION: So is this distinction that the - that 8 - that one case is just more egregious, more an affront to 9 the Constitution, more dangerous, i.e., physical 10 compulsion as opposed to the compulsion that's just 11 presumed from Miranda? 12 MR. DREEBEN: One case, Justice Kennedy, involves 13 a literal violation of the Fifth Amendment. Miranda 14 involves a presumption that this Court 15 QUESTION: Well, then - then you're back into 16 metaphysics. 17 MR. DREEBEN: It is a little metaphysical, 18 Justice Kennedy, but there's a - a pot of truth, I think, 19 a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow here, which is 20 that the Miranda presumption does not mean, this Court has 21 held, that a statement is actually compelled. It protects 22 against the most crucial right contained in the Fifth 23 Amendment itself, which is 24 QUESTION: But you don't think we should 25 differentiate based on the gravity of the - of the wrong
18
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 in either case? 2 MR. DREEBEN: You could look at it that - that 3 way, Justice Kennedy. What - what the Court has done when 4 it's dealt with a - a failure to issue warnings, is 5 balance. It has recognized that, by providing a rule that 6 presumes compulsion in lieu of proving it, the Court has 7 taken a step beyond the core of the constitutional right 8 itself, and the Court's language in its previous cases of 9 calling Miranda warnings and the exclusionary rule under 10 Miranda a prophylactic right is understandable in that 11 sense. Miranda excludes some statements that are not 12 compelled under the Fifth Amendment. 13 QUESTION: May - may I ask this question, Mr. 14 Dreeben? The - there's a distinction in - in your - you 15 submit, between a presumption of involuntariness and 16 actual involuntariness. Do you know any other area of the 17 law in which we've differentiated between a presumed 18 result and an actual result? 19 MR. DREEBEN: I - I - I don't want to go off into 20 an excursion into rules of law that might occur to me as I 21 stand here, Justice Stevens. But what I do know is that 22 the Court's own Miranda jurisprudence 23 QUESTION: My understand - you're - you're 24 there's - there's a lot in the case that support what you 25 say. But I'm suggesting it is kind of a unique
19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 development of the law, because normally I would think if 2 you presume X from Y, that would be the same as proving X. 3 MR. DREEBEN: It 4 QUESTION: But you say that's new - that's not 5 true in this line of - this area of the law? 6 MR. DREEBEN: There is language in the Miranda 7 opinion, as Justice Ginsburg has mentioned, that would 8 support the view that the original vision of Miranda was 9 that it would constitute compulsion 10 QUESTION: Right. 11 MR. DREEBEN: - not merely presume it. But as 12 the Court developed the rule and considered what the costs 13 and benefits would be of having a rule that merely 14 presumed compulsion, any context in which it was not 15 necessarily true. The Miranda Court itself recognized 16 that not all statements taken in custodial interrogation 17 without warnings are compelled. Once you are dealing with 18 a prophylactic rule, it's incumbent upon the Court to 19 balance the benefits against the burdens of the rule. 20 QUESTION: Of course, one of the benefits of 21 under the Miranda analysis, we will - we avoid the 22 necessity of resolving difficult issues of fact sometimes. 23 There are a lot of borderline cases to whether there 24 really was compulsion or it's just presumed. We'll have 25 to get back into that, under your view.
20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think the Court has put 2 itself back into it by adopting the holdings that permit 3 statements that are not warned to be used for impeachment 4 and to be used to obtain leads for other witnesses. 5 QUESTION: Well, I guess we tell juries they can 6 disregard presumptions, but they can't disregard facts. 7 MR. DREEBEN: And I think that that's what the 8 Court has really decided is the right approach when you 9 are outside the core concern that the Miranda Court was 10 addressing, namely the use of the unwarned statement 11 itself. There is a terrible cost to the truth-seeking 12 function of a criminal trial to suppress reliable, 13 physical evidence that was obtained not as the result of a 14 core constitutional violation involving literal compulsion 15 or a substantive due process violation, but merely a 16 failure to issue warnings. 17 QUESTION: It's a terrible cost, but it's a 18 terrible cost for which the law provides a ready means of 19 avoidance. I mean, Miranda's been around for a long time. 20 There is - there's no excuse at this point in our history 21 for the police to say, gee, I - I don't quite understand 22 what Miranda is getting at. And - and that's why it seems 23 to me the cost argument is a weak one 24 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I 25 QUESTION: - and is a - let me just finish this
21
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 sentence. And as against that weak argument, there seems 2 to me a fairly strong argument that if you accept your 3 position, there is a, in - in effect, a recipe for 4 disregarding Miranda, because in every physical evidence 5 case, as in Justice Ginsburg's examples, there's going to 6 be an inducement to say, never mind the statement, just 7 get the evidence, the evidence will take care of the case. 8 So I - it - it - it's seems to me that we got a 9 weak argument on one side and a strong argument on the 10 other side. 11 MR. DREEBEN: Well, there - I - the argument 12 based on cost, Justice Souter, is - is not weak, because 13 the costs are quite real. The jury does not hear the 14 evidence that's suppressed 15 QUESTION: The costs are quite real, but the 16 state knows how to avoid having to pay those costs. It 17 gives the warning. 18 MR. DREEBEN: This Court has repeatedly 19 recognized though that there are situations in which there 20 are ambiguities in the way that Miranda actually applies, 21 and law enforcement officers are going to make mistakes in 22 the way that they apply Miranda. 23 QUESTION: I thought the main rule was, the 24 police, when they take someone into custody, are supposed 25 to give them four warnings, and that seems to me a simple,
22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 clear rule. Now you - you're shifting this to say, well, 2 they don't have to give the warnings up front, that's 3 okay. 4 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. Our 5 position is that if they don't give the warnings up front, 6 they lose the statement that is taken without warnings. 7 That is the Miranda rule, and it responds to the core 8 concern that Miranda had. 9 The question is, how much further should that 10 rule go? And, as I think I answered Justice Souter and 11 yourself earlier, police officers do not know before they 12 get hold of evidence whether they are going to be able to 13 link it to the defendant with other admissible evidence 14 and prove the violation at trial. They are much better 15 off following the Miranda script, getting the admissible 16 evidence of - of the defendant's own statements, and using 17 it to tie the defendant to the evidence. And in a large 18 percent 19 QUESTION: Then - then why do we have - if that's 20 the case, why do we have a case coming up in - in a few 21 minutes in which a - a contrary policy has been adopted? 22 I mean, it - your - your statement that - that the police 23 have much to gain and much to lose if - if - if they - if 24 they follow the practice of avoiding the warnings is - is 25 not intuitively clear this morning.

1 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, I think as the 2 Court will hear more in the next hour, the - the officer 3 in that case acknowledged that he was rolling the dice. 4 There are many reasons why 5 QUESTION: And there was a policy to roll the 6 dice. 7 MR. DREEBEN: That officer testified that he had 8 been trained to do that 9 QUESTION: Yeah. 10 MR. DREEBEN: - and he decided that - that he 11 would in that case. The FBI policy has been, even before 12 Miranda and continuing to this day, that you issue the 13 warnings. You avoid difficult voluntariness inquiries, 14 you smooth the path to admissibility of the evidence, you 15 ensure that the warned statements are admissible. 16 QUESTION: No, I - I'm - I'm sure that that is 17 the FBI policy, but it - the point is, there is a 18 substantial, apparently a substantial body of thought 19 outside the FBI within American law enforcement that dice20 rolling pays off. 21 MR. DREEBEN: Well, it - I think that in many 22 cases it pays off with risks that responsible law 23 enforcement officers often choose not to run. 24 If I could reserve the remainder of my time. 25 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Dreeben.

1 Ms. Wichlens, we'll hear from you. 2 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JILL M. WICHLENS 3 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 4 MS. WICHLENS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 5 may it please the Court: 6 I'd like to begin by responding to the 7 Government's argument that Miranda warnings are not a 8 requirement, they may be simply a matter of proving 9 policy, but are not a requirement. Just three terms ago, 10 this Court reaffirmed in Dickerson that - and I'm quoting 11 from Dickerson - Miranda requires procedures that will 12 warn a suspect in custody of his right to remain silent, 13 which will assure the suspect that the exercise of that 14 right will be honored. 15 QUESTION: Yeah, but I think, Ms. Wichlens, if 16 you read through the entire opinion in Dickerson, it's 17 clear that the warnings are required in order to make the 18 statements admissible. They don't say that mere failure 19 to give the warnings without seeking to follow up with 20 admission is a constitutional violation. 21 MS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor, but in 22 this case they are seeking to admit the evidence. So if 23 there are two components to a Miranda violation, one being 24 the violation in the field by the police officer, the 25 second component is admitting the evidence at trial, and
25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that is exactly what the Government is attempting 2 QUESTION: Well, is - isn't this a fruits case? 3 MS. WICHLENS: It is a fruits case, Your Honor. 4 QUESTION: It's not the statement. 5 MS. WICHLENS: Correct. 6 QUESTION: It is - it is derivatively obtained 7 information. 8 MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely, absolutely. 9 QUESTION: Which might make a difference to you. 10 MS. WICHLENS: It could make a difference, and 11 QUESTION: At least I've thought so. 12 MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely, Your Honor, and 13 following up on a question asked by Justice Kennedy, 14 whether, if this is a constitutional violation, the 15 derivative evidence rule, the fruits rule, would apply. 16 And my answer to that is yes, absolutely, under Wong Sun. 17 If this is a constitutional violation, it would apply in 18 Chavez, just 19 QUESTION: Well, what - what's the magic about 20 that metaphysical rule when we're talking about a 21 different amendment and a different kind of statement or a 22 different kind of - a different kind of evidence than is 23 in the - than the rule itself was designed for primarily? 24 I mean, I don't know why we're just bound by that 25 metaphysical rule.
26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, I'm speaking of Wong 2 Sun for the general proposition that when we have a 3 constitutional violation, turning to the Fifth Amendment 4 specifically, the amendment that we're, of course, 5 concerned with here. In Chavez, a plurality - the 6 plurality opinion in Chavez made it clear that if we have 7 a violation of the Fifth Amendment, then application of 8 the derivative evidence rule is virtually automatic. 9 Now, my argument doesn't rest entirely on the 10 argument that this is a constitutional violation. My 11 first position is that, if it is, it's an automatic 12 application of the derivative evidence rule. But even if 13 it is not, then we go to a balancing and we balance the 14 costs, the benefits of applying a derivative evidence 15 rule. 16 QUESTION: Why - why would there be any cost here 17 to anything if you took the position, as we might take, 18 that if a policeman goes in and purposely doesn't give the 19 warnings when he knows that he should, or even if he 20 reasonably should know and doesn't, we're not going to let 21 in derivatives. 22 MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor 23 QUESTION: But in the unusual case, we're quite 24 it was an honest mistake, as it could be here, because he 25 tried to give the warnings and the defendant said, no, no,
27
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 I know what they are, okay. So - so what cost, if - if 2 there? 3 MS. WICHLENS: Justice Breyer, we need a bright 4 line in this area of the law. This Court has virtually 5 always applied bright lines, particularly in the area of a 6 Miranda violation. 7 QUESTION: Well, we've had - we've had, Ms. 8 Wichlens, probably somewhere between 40 and 50 cases since 9 Miranda was decided, deciding was this interrogation or 10 was it not, was this custody or was it not. There are 11 factual disputes about every single aspect of Miranda. 12 MS. WICHLENS: I think Your Honor's cases, which 13 were, particularly in the early years following Miranda, 14 have now made those rules quite clear what is 15 interrogation, what is custody 16 QUESTION: Well, we - we apply in this area, as 17 regrettably in a lot of others, what we call the totality 18 of the circumstances test. Do you call that a bright 19 line? 20 MS. WICHLENS: Well 21 QUESTION: It seems to me the fuzziest of all 22 lines. 23 MS. WICHLENS: For the voluntariness 24 determination, it is a fuzzy totality of the 25 circumstances, but no, in Miranda, we apply bright lines
28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 determining whether there was interrogation, whether there 2 was custody. We don't try to get inside the head of the 3 individual police officers 4 QUESTION: Well, the brightest line, it seems to 5 me, would be if the policeman knew or should have known 6 that he was supposed to give a warning, fine, the evidence 7 stays out. 8 MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor 9 QUESTION: But now all we're excluding, we're 10 just letting in evidence in those cases where it genuinely 11 is fuzzy and no policeman knows what he's supposed to do, 12 or - or it's at least reasonable for him not to know. 13 Now, under those circumstances, what you do is lose 14 evidence, lose evidence that could be useful in convicting 15 a criminal, and what you gain is precisely nothing, since 16 the policeman, by definition, was confused about the 17 matter and reasonably so. Now, what's the answer to that? 18 MS. WICHLENS: The answer to that is, drawing 19 that bright line, if it is one, Your Honor, I think does 20 require us to get inside the head of the police officer. 21 It requires us to make determinations about whether it was 22 reasonable or not. An individual police officer may have 23 mixed motives. We're not giving 24 QUESTION: We're - we're - we're saying whether a 25 reasonable police officer in the - in the position of this
29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 police officer, would have - would have made the mistake. 2 MS. WICHLENS: If 3 QUESTION: Just as - just as you say, you say for 4 custody we apply a bright line. We don't apply a bright 5 line for custody. The test for custody is whether 6 whether a - a reasonable person would have believed, given 7 the totality of the circumstances, that he was free to 8 leave. 9 MS. WICHLENS: Perhaps, Your Honor, I 10 QUESTION: That - that is anything but bright. 11 MS. WICHLENS: Perhaps I shouldn't say bright 12 line. What I mean is objective versus subjective, and 13 what I urge this Court not to do is impose a subjective 14 test, which requires us to get inside the head of the 15 police officer. 16 QUESTION: Okay. Well, we can apply objective 17 an objective test then. 18 MS. WICHLENS: Under an 19 QUESTION: If a reasonable police officer in the 20 position of this police officer would - would have been 21 confused about the necessity of giving a Miranda warning, 22 then you're - we're at a different situation. 23 MS. WICHLENS: And if it is an objective test, 24 Justice Scalia, then in this case the police officer fails 25 that test.
30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Well, not necessarily. Didn't the 2 suspect here say, don't give me that warning, I know what 3 my rights are, I know about that. 4 MS. WICHLENS: The record shows that the 5 detective said, you have the right to remain silent. Mr. 6 Patane said, I know my rights. Then the detective - and 7 this is the most crucial thing - is the detective not only 8 didn't go on to read the other very critical Miranda 9 rights, also didn't obtain a knowing waiver. He didn't 10 QUESTION: No, wait, you left out - he said it 11 twice, you have the right to remain silent. Patane says, 12 I know my rights. The detective says, you know your 13 rights? 14 MS. WICHLENS: Correct. 15 QUESTION: And the - Patane says, yeah, yeah, I 16 do. 17 MS. WICHLENS: Correct. What he didn't say 18 QUESTION: I know my rights. 19 MS. WICHLENS: What he didn't say was, do you 20 know your right to have counsel here present, Mr. Patane? 21 QUESTION: No, no, I understand that a lawyer 22 might have - who really knows this area, might have 23 understood that you have to do more than that. But is it 24 fair to ask a policeman who's on the line of duty when he 25 tries twice to read him the rights, and each time the
31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 defendant says, no, I know them, forget it. Is it fair to 2 ask the policeman to be the lawyer who has to know you 3 have to go and get out a paper and have him sign it and so 4 forth? 5 MS. WICHLENS: It is absolutely fair to require 6 that of a police officer. He doesn't have to be a lawyer, 7 Your Honor. He has to have attended police academy 101. 8 You read four warnings to a defendant, a suspect, after 9 you arrest him. That is not 10 QUESTION: Well, we're talking here about fruits, 11 the location of the gun and the gun. 12 MS. WICHLENS: Correct. 13 QUESTION: And ever since Oregon v. Elstad, which 14 said it didn't apply to fruits, all the courts of appeals 15 in the Federal circuits, but one, have said it comes in. 16 MS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor. 17 QUESTION: I - this is the - from the one circuit 18 that holds otherwise. 19 MS. WICHLENS: That's correct. 20 QUESTION: And it hasn't resulted in disaster, 21 has it? 22 MS. WICHLENS: I think it is approaching 23 disaster, Your Honor, and the case that's going to follow 24 this one is at one end of the spectrum. We have lawyers 25 in California going on record instructing police officers
32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to violate Miranda on purpose, and they actually use that 2 word. 3 QUESTION: When you say violate, Miranda, Miranda 4 is - is not a command that prohibits police officers, or 5 that requires police officers to give the statements. 6 It's a - it's a - it's a conditional thing. Unless they 7 give the statements, the stuff can't be admitted in 8 evidence. 9 MS. WICHLENS: I respectfully disagree with that, 10 Your Honor. I think Dickerson has made it clear it is a 11 command. Miranda 12 QUESTION: I think - well, I think, having 13 written Dickerson, I think differently. 14 (Laughter.) 15 QUESTION: You're - and you're entitled to read 16 the opinion as you wish. 17 MS. WICHLENS: I understand, Your Honor. The way 18 I read Miranda, its progeny, all the way up to Dickerson 19 and including Dickerson, which, of course, you, Your 20 Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, are the authority on, is that 21 there are two components to a Miranda rule. If the 22 exclusion of evidence is the core of the rule, well then 23 the warning requirement is the rest of the apple. There 24 are two components to the rule, and police officers are 25 being instructed out in the field to violate, to ignore
33
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the first part of the rule. 2 QUESTION: Well, that's not this case. You're 3 arguing somebody else's case. That certainly isn't this 4 case. 5 MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, I am trying to argue 6 the implications of this case. 7 QUESTION: Well, that's why I raised the point, 8 because it seems to me you could have one simple rule 9 maybe. I'm just tying - trying it out for all these 10 cases. You say if the policeman knew or reasonably should 11 have known, well, we're talking about derivative evidence, 12 not - not the evidence itself, but derivative - knew or 13 reasonably should have known, keep it out. But if in fact 14 it was really an honestly borderline thing, at least if 15 we're talking about derivative, then no, you don't have to 16 keep it out. 17 Now, that's simple and we'd send yours back 18 maybe to find out whether he reasonably knew or should 19 have known, et cetera. And I'm testing it on you. I want 20 to see what your reaction is. 21 MS. WICHLENS: Understood. Understood, Your 22 Honor. I think we - we could pass that test, and, of 23 course, it would need to be sent back 24 QUESTION: Oh no, I'm not - I don't - I'm not so 25 interested whether you pass it or not if you don't have
34
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to. But I'm interested in what you think of it. 2 MS. WICHLENS: My preferred test is, you have a 3 Miranda violation, you suppress derivative evidence. I 4 think that's the simplest rule, Your Honor, with all 5 respect. But if we do have an objective reasonableness 6 test, in this case and others like it, it's not 7 objectively reasonable to think you can forego three of 8 the four Miranda warnings, and it's certainly not 9 objectively reasonable to think that you don't have to get 10 the suspect to waive those rights before you go on. 11 QUESTION: Well, so - so far as the defendant is 12 concerned, what - what difference does it make to him 13 whether the officer's failure to give the warnings was 14 intentional or just negligent? 15 MS. WICHLENS: No difference whatsoever, Your 16 Honor, none whatsoever. The suspect is still not informed 17 of his constitutional rights. That's why I believe a 18 brighter line, a simpler test, if you will, Your Honor, is 19 more appropriate. But even under an objective 20 reasonableness test, the Miranda violation in this case 21 was certainly not objectively reasonable. 22 QUESTION: What 23 QUESTION: May I ask you a background question? 24 I think most cases you know whether there was a duty to 25 give the Miranda warnings. Just take a case where it's
35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 clear the officer failed in the - in the duty to give a 2 warning. Is it not correct, as your opponent argued in 3 the first sentence of his oral presentation, that the law 4 has generally been settled for a long time that fruits are 5 nevertheless admissible, and what's your response to that 6 argument? 7 MS. WICHLENS: My response to that, Your Honor, 8 is I think the lower courts have been mistaken. What they 9 have done is taken the language in Elstad, and that 10 decision, of course, did include some language about 11 physical evidence, it was dicta in that case, and that's 12 QUESTION: But I would think very, very sound 13 dicta. 14 (Laughter.) 15 MS. WICHLENS: Well, with respect, Your Honor 16 QUESTION: It makes a very simple rule. You can 17 let it in. 18 MS. WICHLENS: With respect 19 QUESTION: There's your simplicity. 20 MS. WICHLENS: With respect, Your Honor, it makes 21 things simpler, but it doesn't achieve the purposes here 22 for the reasons that some of the Justices here today have 23 pointed out. In the case of physical evidence, the 24 physical evidence is the equivalent of the statements. 25 The police officers -
36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Well, let me - let me ask you this, 2 and I'll - I'll go back and read Miranda to - to make 3 sure. To what extent was the Miranda rule founded on the 4 concern that compelled statements - we'll call them that 5 are unreliable? Wasn't that a - a significant factor? 6 MS. WICHLENS: That was one of the factors. 7 QUESTION: Now, when you have tangible evidence, 8 then the reliability component substantially drops out of 9 the case. 10 MS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor. 11 QUESTION: And it seems to me that that makes 12 the, what you call dicta in Elstad, with reference to 13 physical evidence, point to a case that's even easier than 14 one - than the one that was in Elstad. 15 MS. WICHLENS: Well, Your Honor, I disagree with 16 the conclusion there, because the flip side of that is the 17 - the reliability of the physical evidence and the fact 18 that if the police find out where it is through a Miranda 19 violation, they just go and pick it up. That's what makes 20 physical evidence different, and that what - that is what 21 makes the deterrence factors different here. And so 22 QUESTION: Well, it certainly is reliable. 23 There's no question that it's reliable. 24 MS. WICHLENS: There's - there's no question. 25 Physical evidence is what it is. I - I don't -
37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Then that's - I think that's the point 2 Justice Kennedy was making 3 MS. WICHLENS: Understood. 4 QUESTION: - that the statement might not be 5 reliable. Now, there - there may be other things that 6 work in Miranda, not just to make sure that the statement 7 is reliable. 8 MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely, Your Honor. The other 9 thing that's at work in Miranda and in the Fifth Amendment 10 itself is the notion that the Fifth Amendment isn't just a 11 rule of evidence, just a rule designed to ensure reliable 12 evidence. It's also a rule that recognizes that in a free 13 society, it's repugnant to the concepts of - concept of 14 ordered liberty to compel a citizen to incriminate 15 himself. And so that 16 QUESTION: But we do - we do have a number of 17 things that are permissive - permissible, like a - a voice 18 exemplar 19 MS. WICHLENS: Correct. 20 QUESTION: - or a blood test. 21 MS. WICHLENS: Because none of those involve any 22 testimonial aspect whatsoever, this Court has made very 23 clear. And so we don't really have the derivative 24 evidence rule, the fruit rule, even at issue in those 25 cases. There's no violation whatsoever in those cases,
38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Your Honor. There's no tree, so there can be no fruit. 2 Here, we do have a violation. 3 QUESTION: You have to wind up the rhetoric to a 4 high degree to say that all of society finds this 5 repugnant. The man twice said he didn't want his warnings 6 and he had a gun in the house he wasn't supposed to have. 7 MS. WICHLENS: And we don't know that he knew he 8 had a right to counsel to be there while Detective Benner 9 was saying, you need to tell us about the gun, Mr. Patane. 10 I'm not sure I should tell you about the gun, you might 11 take it away from me. You need to tell us about the gun. 12 If you want to get in front of the domestic violence case, 13 you need to tell us about the gun. I think that is 14 QUESTION: Well, half the problem is that that 15 isn't - I mean, it begs the question to say that that's 16 contrary to established ordered liberty, et cetera, 17 because that is the question. 18 MS. WICHLENS: It's 19 QUESTION: Everybody, I guess, agrees that it 20 does violate those basic principles to permit questioning 21 of the person, compel a statement and then introduce that 22 statement into evidence. 23 MS. WICHLENS: It 24 QUESTION: But apparently, for many, many years, 25 people haven't agreed under the same circumstances that it
39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 violates ordered liberty to get a statement and get 2 physical evidence and introduce the physical evidence. 3 MS. WICHLENS: What I'm talking about, Your 4 Honor, are the two bases underlying the Fifth Amendment, 5 going way back now, not just reliability, but also 6 concepts of, in a free society, should we compel people to 7 incriminate themselves? I understand that there has been 8 a lot of water under the bridge since the framers came up 9 with the Fifth Amendment, but I was answering the 10 questions in terms of 11 QUESTION: And a lot of it was that the police 12 used to beat people up, say, they beat people up. Now, 13 that's very repulsive. 14 MS. WICHLENS: That's correct. 15 QUESTION: But the answer to that is that if they 16 come even close to that, we'll keep the statement out and 17 we will also keep the fruits out. 18 MS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor. But 19 here 20 QUESTION: The - the difference is Miranda 21 doesn't assume compulsion. You're talking as though 22 Miranda - Miranda is a compulsion case. It isn't. It 23 it's a prophylactic rule, even when there has been no 24 compulsion 25 MS. WICHLENS: It's a -
40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: - we keep it out 2 MS. WICHLENS: It's a 3 QUESTION: - we keep it out. 4 MS. WICHLENS: It's a prophylactic rule required 5 by the Constitution, of course. 6 QUESTION: That may well be, but you can't make 7 your argument as though what's at issue here is compulsion 8 and our society has set its face against - against the use 9 of anything obtained by compulsion. There - there is not 10 necessarily compulsion. In fact, there usually isn't 11 compulsion simply because a Miranda warning is - is not 12 given. I expect this - this - this individual in this 13 case did indeed know his rights. 14 MS. WICHLENS: We don't 15 QUESTION: I - I think probably most of the 16 people in this room could read - could - could recite 17 Miranda just from - just from listening to it on 18 television so often. 19 MS. WICHLENS: Well, Your Honor, when I pose that 20 question at cocktail parties, people generally fall off 21 with the fourth - the fourth warning. They don't realize 22 that they would have a right to counsel appointed 23 QUESTION: Well, I mean, that might depend on how 24 late in the cocktail party. I mean, we 25 (Laughter.)
41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: I'm not in any position to pose the 2 question later in the cocktail party, Your Honor. The 3 importance is that the Fifth Amendment protects two 4 things, and Miranda, of course, protects the Fifth 5 Amendment. And if we give the police officer in the field 6 a pass to say, Miranda's optional, you can do a cost7 benefit analysis, you can decide whether you think the 8 statements are really what's going to be important, or you 9 can decide that it's the derivative evidence, the fruit of 10 those statements that's going to be important. We don't 11 have much of a rule at all. 12 As the Tenth Circuit summed it up very aptly, I 13 think, quoting from the decision of the Tenth Circuit, 14 from a practical perspective, we see little difference 15 between the confessional statement, the Glock is in my 16 bedroom on a shelf, which even the Government concedes 17 clearly excluded under Miranda and Wong Sun, and the 18 Government's introduction of the Glock found in the 19 defendant's bedroom on the shelf. It's the same thing in 20 the context of physical evidence. 21 QUESTION: But - but the latter you know is true. 22 The former may - may have been the product of coercion and 23 be false. 24 MS. WICHLENS: Correct, Your Honor, but this is 25 QUESTION: So, I mean, that's a big difference if

1 you think the primary purpose of Miranda is to prevent 2 false testimony from - from being introduced, then it 3 seems to me quite reasonable to say that police can indeed 4 make the choice, do I want to use this testimony. If I 5 don't want to use this testimony, I won't give a Miranda 6 warning, and anything the testimony leads to, if it leads 7 to anything, I - I don't know how the police will always 8 know that - that it will lead to something, so I - I think 9 it's a - a pretty high risk enterprise. 10 But what's - what's wrong with it if - if you 11 think the primary - the primary function of Miranda is to 12 prevent browbeaten statements by - by - by confused people 13 in custody who - who confess mistakenly? 14 MS. WICHLENS: The problem is, it lets the 15 individual officer on the street decide whether he or she 16 is going to give the Miranda warnings in a particular case 17 or not. That's not a rule that law enforcement is behind 18 in, here I'm referring to an amicus filed in - in the 19 companion case of Seibert. 20 Law enforcement doesn't want such a rule, if I 21 may be so bold to say that, in general. They don't want 22 the police officers to have to be trained in the police 23 academy to be a lawyer basically, Your Honor, and try to 24 decide which evidence is going to be most important 25 QUESTION: Well, what - what is your authority,
43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Ms. Wichlens, for saying that law enforcement doesn't want 2 this sort of a rule? 3 MS. WICHLENS: Well, Your Honor, what I'm 4 referring to there very specifically is an amicus filed in 5 the Seibert case by former law enforcement and 6 prosecution. 7 QUESTION: And you think they represent the views 8 of, quote, law enforcement, closed quote, generally? 9 MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, I'm a public defender. 10 I can't speak for the interests of law enforcement. 11 Perhaps I've been presumptuous to 12 QUESTION: Well, you were - you were told in the 13 argument by Mr. Dreeben that that is the practice of the 14 FBI and the Federal law enforcement officers. 15 MS. WICHLENS: That's - that's correct. Prudent 16 police officers, as I understood him to say, will go ahead 17 and give the warnings. But we have some very, if I may 18 say imprudent officers out there, at least in Missouri and 19 California. We know about those. And there are now Web 20 sites that police officers can go on to that instruct in 21 this method, instruct police officers to try to decide 22 what's really important in the case, put themselves in the 23 position of the DA, I suppose, and decide whether the 24 statements are really going to make the case or, in a 25 possessory case, is it the physical evidence that's really
44

1 going to make the case? 2 In this case is a perfect example of that. 3 The information was, he keeps it on his person or in his 4 car or in his home. They're going to investigate a felon 5 in possession of a firearm case. If they find that 6 firearm in his bedroom or in his car, that's pretty much 7 all she wrote. The prosecution doesn't need a lot more. 8 They don't need the suspect's statements about where that 9 is, and so that's why we can draw a line between physical 10 evidence and other types of evidence. 11 And I could add 12 QUESTION: All right. So what? That's - we're 13 going to the same thing - let's suppose they found out 14 about that gun without compelling anything, no compulsion 15 16 MS. WICHLENS: But violating Miranda. 17 QUESTION: - no testifying against yourself. 18 MS. WICHLENS: But violating the Miranda rule. 19 QUESTION: But they didn't omit - they omitted 20 the Miranda warning. 21 MS. WICHLENS: And we 22 QUESTION: And the Miranda warning is a way of 23 stopping the compulsion. But if you're willing to assume 24 there is no compulsion, what's so horrible about it? 25 MS. WICHLENS: Well, I'm - I'm not willing to
45
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 assume there is no compulsion. 2 QUESTION: Ah, well if there is - then what 3 you've got is Miranda as a way of getting at instances 4 where there is compulsion. 5 MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely. 6 QUESTION: Fine. 7 MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely. That is the basic 8 premise of Miranda. 9 QUESTION: Does that apply to the physical 10 evidence too? 11 MS. WICHLENS: Yes. I mean, the - the basic 12 premise, if we want police officers to comply with 13 Miranda. And if I could say another word about Elstad, 14 part of - a central part of the holding in Elstad, as I 15 understand it, was that in that case, the initial 16 constitutional violation is cured by the time the 17 subsequent statement comes around. In other words, you 18 have a Miranda violation, the Miranda warnings are not 19 read, the person is interrogated, then the Miranda 20 warnings are carefully and thoroughly read. 21 And as this Court stated in Elstad, and I'm 22 quoting, a careful and thorough administration of Miranda 23 warnings serves to cure the condition that rendered the 24 unwarned statements inadmissible. We can't possibly have 25 that type of cure in the case of physical evidence. When
46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the police officer is going simply to seize the physical 2 evidence, there's no curing of the Miranda violation, and 3 that's another way that Elstad is distinguishable. 4 QUESTION: But was there never a question in this 5 case of whether the - there was consent to this search, 6 because the defendant said twice, I know my rights? 7 MS. WICHLENS: And you're speaking of the consent 8 to the search, Your Honor? Because then Detective Benner 9 QUESTION: Consent to the questioning, and then 10 voluntarily telling them, it's on a shelf in my bedroom? 11 Why wasn't the - the whole thing pretty much like when you 12 go to the bus terminal and say, mind if I ask you a 13 question? 14 MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, because he was under 15 arrest. He - he had been told he was under formal arrest. 16 He was in handcuffs. And so the Miranda warnings - the 17 Miranda warning requirement clearly applied. And so 18 Detective Benner was not to ask those questions without 19 having warned him first. 20 QUESTION: Okay. Well, that's just a silly rule, 21 isn't it? I mean 22 MS. WICHLENS: Miranda's not a silly rule, Your 23 Honor. 24 QUESTION: Well, it - it is when the person says, 25 I know my right. What if he stuck his fingers in his
47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 ears, saying, I don't want to hear them, I don't want to 2 hear them. 3 (Laughter.) 4 QUESTION: But you have to read it to him anyway? 5 MS. WICHLENS: It's not hard to say, sorry, pal, 6 I have to read them to you, and even if you don't want to 7 require the officer to do that, how about, okay, pal, 8 would you like to waive those rights? That's an important 9 part of Miranda law also: A, inform the suspect of his 10 rights, B, ask him if he would like to waive them. 11 QUESTION: We take the case on the assumption, 12 the Government's question that there was a failure to give 13 a suspect the Miranda warnings here, do we not? 14 MS. WICHLENS: Correct. Although the 15 Government's concession in the lower courts, district 16 court and Tenth Circuit, is that Miranda was violated 17 because there was a lack of a knowing waiver of those 18 Miranda rights, and that's the basis on which the district 19 court accepted the Government's concession. But the 20 QUESTION: What did the court of appeals - what 21 did the court of appeals 22 MS. WICHLENS: The court of appeals assumed a 23 Miranda violation, and I believe repeated the language 24 about the waiver problem. 25 QUESTION: May I ask you if you - there was a lot
48
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 of interruptions to your answer to my question. If you 2 had inadequate time to say everything you wanted to say 3 about the settled state of the law before this case arose 4 by - in the lower courts, that's your opponent's original 5 argument. 6 MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, simply that those 7 cases were mistaken. This Court had never spoken directly 8 on the subject of derivative evidence rule in the context 9 of physical evidence. And the times have changed, Your 10 Honor. The time of Elstad and some of this Court's cases, 11 New York v. Harris, that followed Miranda most 12 immediately, we all assumed, naively it turns out, that 13 police officers would at least try to comply with Miranda. 14 And now there's this movement afoot to basically thumb 15 their noses, if you will, at this Court's Miranda decision 16 and say Miranda is just an option. 17 QUESTION: May I ask you if the state courts were 18 uniform in the same way the Federal courts were? 19 MS. WICHLENS: The state courts were not. I've 20 cited some cases in my brief, both pre-Dickerson and post21 Dickerson, where the state courts were not at all uniform. 22 QUESTION: And was that on both the matter of 23 subsequent confessions and physical evidence? 24 MS. WICHLENS: Correct, Your Honor, as I recall. 25 If there are no further questions from the
49
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Court, I would ask this Court to hold that the derivative 2 evidence rule applies to physical evidence fruit of a 3 Miranda violation and to affirm the judgment of the Tenth 4 Circuit Court of Appeals. 5 QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Wichlens. 6 Mr. Dreeben, you have three minutes remaining. 7 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 10 Miranda is a rule that is perfectly matched to the problem 11 that the Court sought to address, namely the risk that the 12 defendant's own self-incriminating statements would be 13 obtained by compulsion and admitted against him to prove 14 his guilt. That risk implicated two central concerns of 15 the Fifth Amendment, one going to reliability, the other 16 going to the state's burden to prove guilt with evidence 17 other than that extracted from the defendant's own mouth. 18 Extension of Miranda to this case, which 19 involves physical evidence that does not involve the 20 reliability concerns that are at the heart of the Fifth 21 Amendment, and does not involve the concern about using 22 the defendant's own self-compelled words to incriminate 23 him, would not only be contrary to the body of authority 24 in the lower courts before this Court's decision in 25 Dickerson and largely after it, but would also be contrary

1 to the purpose of truth-seeking in a criminal trial that 2 is central to the Court's jurisprudence in this area. 3 Justice Stevens, I - as far as the Government is 4 aware, there was no more than a handful of cases in the 5 state courts that have followed the rule, other than what 6 the Federal rule had been. Justice White's dissenting 7 opinion from the denial of certiorari in the Patterson 8 case, I believe, collects them, but this was by no means a 9 groundswell movement in the state courts. 10 QUESTION: Well, I understand, but I noticed that 11 in your brief, in your oral statement you said that they 12 were unanimous, your brief said there was a strong 13 majority in the Federal courts. I haven't checked it out 14 myself but is it - is it a unanimous view in the Federal 15 courts? 16 MR. DREEBEN: My understanding is that there are 17 eight Federal circuits before Dickerson, including the 18 Tenth Circuit, that it held that suppression of derivative 19 physical evidence was not warranted. Since Dickerson, 20 only the Tenth Circuit has changed its position, and there 21 is no other court, other than the First Circuit, which 22 follows a rule that depends on - on balancing deterrence 23 concerns against the loss to - of evidence to the trial, 24 that follows anything akin to the kind of derivative 25 suppression rule that the Tenth Circuit adopted in this

1 case. 2 Thank you. 3 QUESTION: Well, wait, can I - if you have a 4 minute. What if the policeman deliberately fails to give 5 the Miranda warning in order to get the physical evidence? 6 MR. DREEBEN: In our view, Justice Breyer, no 7 different rule is warranted in that situation, because 8 Miranda continues to protect against the risk that it's 9 aimed at. Absent actual compulsion, there is no warrant 10 for a rule that does anything other than suppress the 11 actual statements. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. 13 The case is submitted. 14 (Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the 15 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
