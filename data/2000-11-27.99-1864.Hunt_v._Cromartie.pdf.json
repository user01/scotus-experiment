    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the Shaw versus Reno line of cases this Court established two important propositions.  The first is that the Constitution does not tolerate using race as the predominant factor in drawing legislative districts.  When a district is drawn predominantly on racial lines, the state reinforces harmful racial stereotypes.  It sends a message to elected officials that they represent only a particular racial group. Those cases stand also for a second proposition. As this Court said in Miller, Federal court review of districting legislation represents a serious intrusion on the most vital of local functions.  For this reason, the important second principle is that Federal courts adjudicating Shaw claims must exercise extraordinary perfectly happy to meet the standard that the conclusions were clearly erroneous. Because the court did not separate out findings of fact from conclusions of law, it is possible to read the opinion as if the court did not actually apply the standard, but requiring a predominance of race to be shown, in which case it would have applied the wrong legal standard, but taking them to have found that race predominated here, in our view that is clearly erroneous. I only mean to suggest, as this Court has said in Bush v. Vera, and in Miller that because redistricting is such an exceedingly sensitive matter that the Court should be awfully cautious before they conclude that a state legislature --"

    "speaker": "DELLINGER",

We set out at pages 25 to 33 of our brief, we really have to go through the trial transcript citations, the court says, for example, that where splits occur in District 12 in the six counties between District 12 and the other districts, majority Republican, went out and took that in, in order to bring in the minority group, even though that was contrary to the asserted goal.  That's set out at page 917 of Bush v. Vera. There is simply no instance of that. The two big items of proof -- I am quite confident that reversing the court below and sustaining the North Carolina plan will not in any way impair the vitality of this Court's antiracial gerrymandering principle either on --"

    "speech": "Let me go to explain why those 40 percent or more African-American precincts in the six counties, 90 percent, whereas if you look at the Democratic counties, even as measured by reliable voting day Democrats, only about half of the Democratic counties -- I'm sorry, only about half of the Democratic precincts in the six counties are taken in.  That was their proof that the lines follow race more precisely than politics. But look at those figures.  They're set out in Exhibit 309 on page 515.  There are 429 precincts in these six counties.  Of those 429 precincts, 79 of them are 40 percent or more African-American.  Understandably, those are the most reliable Democratic voting precincts, and therefore they form the core of a difficult attempt to create the Democratic congressional district in this Republican area.  So 76 of the 79 African-American precincts which are the most reliable Democratic precincts majority black district or precinct, precinct, that conceivably could be included in this district that was not included, and he said, rather astonishingly, no."

He talked about how there were -- and Justice Kennedy, the reason that makes sense, that all the African-American precincts that could reasonably have been included are included is that those are the core Democratic precincts in what is basically a Republican area of North Carolina in the Piedmont Carolinas, so that is naturally the core that is the overlap, and that is the correlation. There are other Democratic precincts, Dr. Weber noted, that are not included, and he was asked the following question at page 140 of the Joint Appendix. Question:  Are the white precincts as heavily Democratic?"

This is a districting process in which the state used voting statistics of how people actually voted, not the color of their skin, how did they vote, in constructing this district, unlike the districts in Miller and Bush v. Vera. Instead of using racially encoded census blocks, they used precinct voting day election patterns.

To use something which correlates with race, for example, in Batt and Hernandez, the Texas case involving, requiring English speakers on referred to in your opponent's brief, if I remember it correctly, the red brief pointed out the statement of Senator Cooper's on the floor of the legislature to the effect that the plan that was being proposed was not an incumbency protection plan, which lends obvious weight to the interpretation that it was a racial protection."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DELLINGER",
    "speech": "All right, Justice Souter, I believe that was a matter of his objecting to the labeling of the incumbency protection.  He goes on to say in the same sentence that the -- literally in the next sentence, that the purpose of the plan is to protect the state's existing 6-6 Republican-Democratic split.  This was a bipartisan state legislature, a Republican House, a Democratic Senate.  Neither side could agree to reduce.  I think Senator Cooper was only objecting to the terminology and not to the fact that to maintain a 6-6 balance you had The answer is no.  That was the use of race, and it is also the case that when in most all instances, perhaps not every, that a state undertakes to make race drive the process, there will be plenty of evidence of it. For example, you will find areas whereas in Bush v. Vera, if you have, say, a Republican district that has a significant number of minorities in it, we put it in a supposedly Democratic district, so that shows it following ways. That's how you prove it.  Moreover --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Dellinger, there is some evidence here, I mean, besides Senator Cooper's statement, which, you know, you offer an alternate explanation for, but you have to explain it, and once it becomes debatable, it's hard for us to say that the finding of the court below was clearly erroneous. Another thing that has to be explained away is, together a district that had predominantly black voters in it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DELLINGER",
    "speech": "Let me suggest why  I think that is really utterly insufficient as being really probative, to set aside a fundamental act of political self-definition by a state legislature. This is a sentence in an E-mail from a staffer to members that says that in the districting context where they have to talk about race because of the Voting Rights Act, he notes that the change he has been making is that they're now going to for very good nonracial reasons include Greensboro in District 12, the Democratic parts of Greensboro, and refers to that by saying, I have moved the Greensboro black community into the 12th. Now, I am not going to tell you that that is without any probative value, but in order for it to play two recipients, and you have to assume that that would be evidence of the predominance of race.  I simply don't think it will bear that kind of weight.  A stray remark like this, to use a stray remark like this would be akin to a stringent speech code where legislators who engage in the sensitive redistricting process found state law brought into jeopardy, and that's why there's very good reason for predominance. The other way to prove a Shaw violation, if I may turn just for a moment to Justice Kennedy's question, the other way to prove a Shaw violation is quite simple. When the state says we're using politics, not race, it turns out that there are a lot of high proportion of African-Americans, that's because they're reliable Democrats.  You can often come in and show, now, wait a minute, there would be a very easy way, more sensible Mr. Stein, we'll hear from you."

And the maps and the records show that's not true. The District Court also found, and I quote, Dr. Weber showed that, not just in his opinion, showed that without fail Democratic districts adjacent to District 12 yielded their minority areas to that district, retaining quite Democratic precincts. And of course this would be an important finding if it were true.  It would be very much like Vera where made which is simply not supported by the record and is clearly erroneous. I would point out that in choosing between Dr. Weber and Dr. Peterson, it said that Dr. Peterson's evidence was unreliable because it ignored the core, but this Court said in Vera that the difference between areas just inside and just outside the district is particularly probative in this sort of case, and that's exactly what Dr. Peterson did, but that's what Dr. Weber criticized him for. I would like to address an argument advanced by appellees that was relied on by the court below, but they offer it here in support of the judgment below.

Now, you find that of the people who are in the racial core.

With respect to the 1st, which was even more racially dominated, as I understand it, than the 12th, the court said that's okay, but not with respect to the 12th.

A lot of counties there are over 50 percent African-American in population in the northeastern part of the state.  That is all rural, virtually all rural, although there are some smaller towns there. swaps could be made, and you give a few examples, and in every example the result would be a more bizarre shape, not a more compact shape.

When you take all that together, you can say all the presumption in the world about good faith, but in this instance, regardless of what presumption you want to give, the facts as found by that court after hearing witnesses and determining the credibility is that the predominant motive was racial. Now, back in 19 -- on the '92 plan, they were saying it wasn't racial.  To say something is political or many instances, but on the other hand if you have a strong racial minority well-positioned in a particular political party, they can say, as we think the evidence indicates was said in this case, and remember that the 1st and the 12th Districts were really the first two that they started with.  Then they began worrying about some other things. They can say, we want a district where we can be assured that a minority candidate will be nominated and will be elected.

Cromartie, not --"

    "speech": "Yeah, I mean this side, this side. And then in response -- am I right so far that one of the main arguments was, look, this is not Democrats, this is race, and you can show it by looking at the heavily Democratic districts that they left out and the heavily less Democratic, the heavily African-Americans that they put in.  That's the argument. And what this Court said in response is, wait a minute, if you're going to argue that, don't measure it by registration, measure it by how people vote because a lot of registered Democrats vote Republican.  That's what this Court said in its opinion.  Is that fair?"

    "speech": "And now when I look at the district registration.  Just what we said he shouldn't use. And then I looked at your maps, which very honestly, are not registration, they are how people really vote, and the yellows are the Democrats and the yellows are in, in, in, and there are just a handful of the hundred precincts that are out. So what am I supposed to do about that finding? It looks as that finding is a finding that's based on the very thing we said not to use -- registration."

    "speaker": "EVERETT",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I think you said -- you're there to look at other considerations.  I don't think you said registration was totally out. they're glued together.  In Charlotte, in Winston-Salem, and in Greensboro.  I believe there was testimony by Dr. Weber that he had looked at all three aspects -- he looked at the three elections which had been considered by the General Assembly and were before them, and came to the same conclusion. This was all grouped under party affiliation.  So he certainly came to that conclusion. The Court may have pointed out simply a few that were left out, and maybe there were only a few.  But there was a lot of evidence that was generated by Dr. Weber that concerned the primacy of race as a motive over politics. So I think, if you look at it in context, Your Honor, and look at the other things, look at some of the statements in the record, look at what we termed the smoking gun, the E-mail, look at the testimony of the legislators who we called and other persons who we called, evidence, maybe it's more than that, the use of pretext, as I recall from the Reeves case that was decided this summer can itself be positive evidence of a particular state of mind, and we would submit that the pattern followed by the State in terms of concealment, excuses, and it's a pattern that continues from the past in respect to the 1992 plan, that this in itself is evidence.  You take the whole thing, you look at what they were doing with the 1st District where they were concentrating on percentages, you look at the district here, District 12, where it was announced to the Senate by Senator Cooper that as long as they were under 50 percent they were home free, and then look at the way they increased the percentages."

    "speech": "It's getting too big for my taste, but it's -- but the -- they accomplish this in every instance by creating districts, one for the Republican Sue Myrick in Mecklenburg county and one for the Democrat Mel Watt, each a rising star.  Their expert thought Mecklenburg should be entirely within one district, but Charlotte is very happy to have rising stars in each party represent Charlotte, and neither of the political parties wanted to cede Charlotte to the other. So you really have an expert who is making political judgments. are defined by their race, and when race predominates, you have the Shaw harm. To move to a more extreme exclusion of race would create a hair trigger in which legislatures would be completely uncertain of their ability to legislate.  We'll have judges creating election districts and rather than state legislatures doing this critically important task that involves political judgment, we usually say plans that do not cause expressive harms should not be declared unlawful.  Thank you."
