I don't know why a co-employee who has a hostile motivation and makes a report to the supervisor who ultimately dismisses the unrelated to this particular department put a false charge in a -- a suggestion box, that wouldn't be any different. Ordinarily, a coworker wouldn't qualify under agency principles as an agent of the employer when engaging in that conduct. You have to look at the specific conduct and apply the traditional agency standards. They are laid out, for example, in the Court's decision in Ellerth, which refers to the two branches of agency law: scope of employment, and action which is aided in, where the actor was aided in the conduct by his or her official position. And I think those principles would not ordinarily apply to a coworker, but they would also not apply invariably to a supervisor. This isn't -- we're not advocating the supervisor versus non-supervisor distinction in Ellerth, but -- but a return to just the traditional agency doctrines. And we think those doctrines delineate who is the employer for the purpose of the statute, which bans action by the employer. doctrines."

So -- what -- the kind of thing they did was the kind of work that they were employed to engage in, and that distinguishes them from, say, another supervisor who might slip a note into a suggestion box. Second, the other branch, major branch, of agency law is that an employer is liable for actions of individuals when their conduct -- when they are aided in their conduct by their official position, which would agrees she wrote it.

Now, I'm not suggesting that's the right rule. That's a very unattractive rule. But the rule that you have suggested is also a very unattractive rule, one that I doubt the Congress intended to adopt. -- are discretionary and, whereas 4311(c)(1) says \"shall,\" 4323 in describing all the remedies says \"may.\" And so a court could take those things into account in framing a remedy. And certainly the good faith efforts of someone in Buck's position, for example, would be relevant to a determination whether a violation was willful. And that, in fact, reflects what happened in this case, which is that the jury found that there was a violation -- found that the -- the motivations involved here included an improper motivation, rejected the 4311(c)(1) defense, but then found the violation wasn't willful. So I think, given the structure of the statute, the -- the play here, the ability to adjust to those circumstances, is in the remedy provision, not in the mandatory language of the 4311(c)(1)."

    "speaker": "MILLER",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: An employer is liable under USERRA when a supervisor acting with a discriminatory motive uses a delegated authority to cause an adverse employment action. The court of appeals held that liability does not attach unless that supervisor exerts singular influence over the decisionmaker. But that standard is inconsistent with the statute for two reasons. First, it's incompatible with the statutory definition of \"employer,\" which includes not just the ultimate decisionmaker, but any person to whom the employer has delegated the performance of significant employment responsibilities. Second, it's contrary to the statute's causation standard, which requires only that military status be a motivating factor, not necessarily a singularly important factor or the determinative factor it has to be a motivating factor, and that's the plaintiff's burden to establish in order to make a prima facie case under section 4311(c). And then there is an affirmative defense if the employer can show that it was not a but-for factor in the sense that, you know, even had the person not been in the military, the same action would have been taken. That's the -- if the employer can show that, then it's absolved of liability."

    "speaker": "MILLER",

Something can be a motivating factor if it is one of many factors, but, in our view, it does need to be more than a trivial or de minimis factor, and if you have a situation where the bias -- the action of the biased supervisor leads through a long and improbable and unforeseeable chain of causation to the adverse employment action, you might have a but-for cause, but you wouldn't have proximate cause, and it wouldn't be a motivating factor. Now, this case, and I think most real-world cases, are quite different from that. Here we have a termination decision, and that was made by Buck on the basis of the January 27th warning that was given to Petitioner and the report that Petitioner had not complied with that warning.

And it says that an employer cannot take action, one of those actions, on the basis of four factors: membership, application for membership, performance, service -- or service of obligation in the uniformed services. So there has to be something to connect one of those factors to one of those five actions. And that's the literal meaning of the statute. And I think the Seventh Circuit's view is absolutely consistent with that."

And in this case, it's Linda Buck. And this statute creates personal liability for Ms. Buck or anybody else who makes a decision if it's based on one of these factors contained in the statute. I don't think there's any way a jury would be allowed to consider whether or not Ms. Buck is in violation of the statute, because there's an absolute information that she has gathered."

As I understand their opinion, they say that the statute requires that the -- let me get the right language here -- that the discriminatory -- prohibited discriminatory factor must have been a motivating factor in the employer's action. And they say that means it must have motivated the person who took the employer's action. It's not a motivating factor in the employer's action unless the person who took the action on behalf of the employer had that as its motive. Then the court of appeals makes an exception: However, if the person who appears to be taking the action on behalf of the employer is really not the person who took the action, but was totally under the control of a subordinate who -- and the person just swallowed that subordinate's determination, then we will hold, even though the ultimate firing -- the person who signed the pink slip, even though that person didn't have the motive, if in fact the decision was effectively the decision of a lower subordinate, we will hold the employer. It has nothing to do with proximate cause. It has to do with the text that it has to be a motivating factor in the employer's action; not a motivating factor somewhere down the line, but in the employer's action. That's how I read the court of appeals' opinion."

That's quite different from a motivating factor in the decision. You -- you have to get us to believe -- and I'm not sure we will -- that \"motivating factor in the decision\" refers to motive on the part of the person who made the decision.

Those two situations -- the second seems to me one of 80 -- 80 million situations, fact-related, that could arise, and I don't know why we want a special standard for such a situation.

Is it a truthful statement by her? It is absolutely a truthful statement by her, and that was the reason for her actions. I think Ms. Buck's consideration of the discharge decision wasn't limited to one source. It clearly was not. No one shaped or directed the scope of her determination.

And -- and that, it seems to me, you have to read -- you have to read the rest of the statute. Secondly, this -- USERRA is unique among employment statutes or close to it, because the employer has an economic incentive to break the law. It's expensive to keep reservists on the book.

So if some -- you could pointed out, amici on the other side, employers typically make a disciplinary decision as a result of a bunch of different decisions. The Seventh Circuit holds that so long as the employer divides up those responsibilities, USERRA will not apply to many of the decisions. On their view, USERRA applies only to what the last decisionmaker did. And the narrower her role, the narrower the protections of the statute. This statute should not be read in that way, not only because of the language that I've recounted, but because USERRA, it's reemployment rights, and it's antidiscrimination rights play an essential role in the national defense. They safeguard the livelihood of men and women who safeguard the nation. And Congress would have wanted that statute read broadly. Thank you."
