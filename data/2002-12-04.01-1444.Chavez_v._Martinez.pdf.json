    "speech": "Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit held in this case that petitioner Ben Chavez could not assert a qualified immunity defense to a section 1983 lawsuit alleging that his interrogation of respondent violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. We believe that ruling to be mistaken. First, there was no constitutional violation at all on these facts. But second, if there was a constitutional right implicated, that right was not clearly established in the particularized sense required by this Court's qualified immunity cases. Officer Chavez could not reasonably have known that what he was doing violated that right, and the judgment of the Ninth Circuit should, therefore, be reversed."

Would he be entitled to qualified immunity then?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBBINS",
    "speech": "Well, I think -- I think the -- the answer is that while -- while he might have believed that the Constitution would in time be violated, because he could not himself violate it, he couldn't -- he couldn't be liable under section 1983 for committing a Fifth Amendment violation. So the point is you don't even get to the question of clearly established if there's no established constitutional violation at all."

The premise is we need to ensure against -- in a way it's a prophylactic protection much like Miranda is. That is to say, we will let you assert it in what is concededly, for example, a civil litigation setting, a simple deposition. No one would suggest that that is a use in a criminal case. But we allow you to assert it because if we didn't, it would compromise your ability to ensure that the right is protected later."

However -- but let me be clear -- the actual violation of the Fifth Amendment is exactly what the text of the Fifth Amendment says. It says that your right is not to be a witness against yourself in a criminal case. I suggest, Justice Kennedy, that the result -- that the holding in Murphy against the Waterfront Commission is inexplicable if you believe, as the Ninth Circuit does, that it is sufficient simply to coerce an otherwise incriminating statement because in Murphy against the Waterfront Commission, the holding of that case is that the State court was correct in requiring the witness to testify even though there wasn't a statute that protected him against incrimination because the Fifth Amendment itself provides the fail-safe that if you are coerced into giving an otherwise incriminating statement, it cannot be used against you. And my central submission on the Fifth Amendment point -- and of course, this is before we even get to the question whether Office Chavez could have -- you know, has qualified immunity. Our central submission on this is that you don't even have to get to that point because the fail-safe of the Fifth Amendment ensures that Mr. Martinez's statements could not be used against him in a criminal case if they were indeed legally compelled --"

Getting to your question, Justice Breyer, he did not violate the substantive component of the Due Process Clause because that inquiry turns on a set of concerns, including did the acts shock the conscience. Were they committed with the intent to harm the witness in the sense required by Sacramento against Lewis? The failure of the Ninth Circuit in this case with respect to the substantive due process analysis was that it thought that any interrogation which would render a statement involuntary and therefore inadmissible at trial must, therefore, give rise to a freestanding substantive due process claim, actionable and enforceable under section 1983. That's just wrong."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

So you can say, police officer, you're not required to give Miranda warnings if we're not going to use this testimony in court."

  {
    "speaker": "ROBBINS",
    "speech": "I -- I respectfully beg to differ, and I -- I also think -- I must say, given the prominence of the Miranda discussion in the respondent's brief and in the green -- green brief supporting respondent, I believe the Miranda concerns in this case are an utter red herring, and let me say why. The sanction for the violation of Miranda is, in fact, that the statements taken in violation of Miranda cannot be used in the direct case of the government. That's the penalty for Miranda, and if that happens, you get the statement struck in the direct case for the government."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But there -- you're saying there is no 1983 penalty. The penalty is you can't --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBBINS",
    "speech": "I -- I think there is no 1983 penalty, but the suggestion that as a consequence, because you don't have a freestanding section 1983 claim when the evidence never comes in, when the statement is never offered, the suggestion that that is therefore going to be -- send a signal to police officers that they should violate Miranda, you know, at their -- at their discretion I think is terribly mistaken, and for a very important reason and it's this: If you don't give Miranda warnings, you run a serious risk that the failure to give those warnings will be taken as part of the calculus under the Fifth Amendment voluntariness inquiry. And a statement which is involuntary for Fifth Amendment purposes is unusable for any purpose at all, direct case, impeachment, derivative use. The government then has to put on a Kastigar hearing to show that all of its evidence was independently derived, which is, as the Court said in Kastigar, a heavy burden for the government to meet. It is a fool's errand I suggest, Justice Ginsburg -- a fool's errand -- to go about deliberately violating Miranda simply because the violation will not cause -- give rise to a section 1983 violation."

And -- and you can say, all right, at this point, I would think that does shock the conscience for a policeman to beat a confession out of somebody, and so I don't care if you call it Fourteenth or Fifth. But then the question here would be, why in heaven's name, when the person is undergoing serious pain, or he thinks he's dying, where the doctors are saying, get out of here, et cetera, whatever they're saying, and he continues to press and then says, well, you're going to get your treatment after you confess -- not confess -- after -- after you answer my question. What were you doing? Then we'll treat you. He says, you want your treatment, you'd better -- you better say something, et cetera, et cetera. Why isn't that the equivalent of beating somebody up?"

To turn, Justice Breyer, to your question, I acknowledge that there is coercion in this case. We don't -- we don't blanch on that. There was coercion and the facts of this case are tragic, but the -- but the reality is this.

But let me go -- there's a terribly important thing, Justice O'Connor, I have not yet gotten to say in answer to your question. The further and perhaps most fundamental reason why it would be a mistake, I respectfully suggest, to affirm this judgment, even on the due process argument, is that this is a qualified immunity case. So you must conclude not only that on balance this rises to the shock-the-conscience standard, but that it does so with such remarkable clarity that it must have been surely apparent to this officer that he was violating that standard. You cannot find that on this record. The Ninth Circuit thought so because of Mincey, which is a fair trial and admissibility of evidence case, not a freestanding substantive due process case and which had all manner of important differences from the facts of this case, including an absence -- a total absence -- of exigency.

It's a different calculus, though, when you're trying to regulate primary law enforcement conduct because it strikes me that not everything that a law enforcement officer could do to coerce a confession -- there -- there may be some acts that may be sufficiently problematic that you'd certainly want to keep the confession out of the trial."

We say if he raises it, and they don't come forward with immunity, we're not going to let this entire process go forward to no avail since nothing can ever be admitted in evidence anyway. The fact is we -- the -- the rule allowing it to be raised in anticipation I suppose would be the predicate for 1983 liability here.

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, maybe the -- the point where it would make a difference I guess -- nobody is talking about weakening or overruling Miranda. We have Miranda on the books, and Miranda set some technical requirements. You have to give a warning. Now, a failure to give a warning, pure and simple, is not going to hurt anybody if that's never used in trial, so there isn't 1983 damages, unless you beat the person up. Then there is. And that comes under the Fourteenth. But there are a set of cases where it will hurt people. The set of cases where it will hurt people is where because they violated Miranda but didn't beat him up, and got a statement, they kept him in jail. That's rather like the case Justice Kennedy's thinking of. So there he is in jail for a week or a month and he's been hurt, all right. And the question I guess is -- it's really not this case, but the question is, is there going to be a 1983 action in that kind of case? And if you say it comes under the Fifth Amendment, the answer is going to be yes. And if you say it comes under the Fourteenth Amendment, the answer is going to be no.

And we have a different rule that operates in the context of police custodial interrogation. In that context, the privilege is self-executing. The individual doesn't have to raise it. And -- as -- the other thing that's different about the custodial context is that in the custodial context, this Court has not insisted on a pre-testimony grant of immunity. They've always held that the exclusionary rules prevent a constitutional violation from occurring. And if I could resort to the analogy to the takings clause. In that context, it's not enough for the government to take property.

And it goes directly to the issue of what we've been discussing and that is the -- the intent. And just if I can back up a little bit procedurally, in argument today, for the first time I heard counsel say that they acknowledge there's no quarrel that there was coercion in this case. In the district court, the entire argument was there was no coercion. At the court of appeals, the entire argument was there was no coercion. At the court of appeals and the district court, the -- there was never a discussion or -- or even was the case of Urquidez -- Verdugo Urquidez cited for the fact of -- that this was -- the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments were only a trial right. Those issues are being heard here for the first time. They were briefed for the first time in the opening brief. Cert was granted in this case on whether there was a violation of the Fifth Amendment, not -- the Fourteenth Amendment wasn't even discussed on cert. So we've gone through this journey of ever- changing theories of -- of liability in this case, but I think we have to go back to the beginning. The district court found at page 28, finally defendants argued that Chavez was not attempting to abridge the right against self-incrimination to -- to exact -- extract self-inculpatory data or leads. And the court goes on to then describe what was argued by the defense, that Mr. Chavez was there simply to find out what happened. The court directly rejected that."

I was there to investigate what -- the crime had been committed, the crime of attempted murder on two police officers on the theory that somehow or other this farm worker had taken away the officer's gun and was going to use it on the officers when they shot him. That was the core of the case. That was all of the evidence in the case. The subsequent declarations that were submitted were only submitted after -- after Mr. Martinez submitted a motion for summary judgment that as a matter of law, using all of the evidence provided by the defense and giving them the benefit of the doubt on all the evidence, that there was a violation of the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendment."

Suppose you have a situation in which a -- a felon has taken a hostage and buried the hostage somewhere, and suppose that it is possible for the police official to use a degree of coercion which would not shock the conscience. It isn't beating the person with a rubber hose, but let's say failing to give a Miranda warning, or using a -- a sort of trickery that -- that would amount to coercion, threatening perhaps, you know, if you don't confess, your brother will be prosecuted or something like that. It would be sufficient to exclude the testimony from the confession from the trial, but the policeman doesn't care about that. He wants to save the life of the -- of the hostage who's been -- who's been buried. Now, you would say that that -- that policeman by extracting that confession has violated the Fifth Amendment."

And obviously the officer is not going to use leading questions, coercive questions to get information. The basic concept of getting information under those circumstances is you want it to be trustworthy. You don't want the officer putting words into the person's mouth and brow-beating them to come up with something that's a bad lead. So obviously we want to have the kind of questioning that would be, in fact, seeking the truth as opposed to putting words into someone's mouth as what occurred in this case. The -- I'd like to address a point that's been raised, and -- and it may not be totally necessary. I'd just like to make the distinction that the -- the basis, the entire heart of the discussion that coercion is somehow permissible unless the cases are introduced into a criminal case or into a criminal trial are -- are the -- the immunity cases. In the immunity cases, they -- they -- I believe that the defense has -- or that the petitioners have totally confused the grant of immunity and coercion in a public trial after a grant of immunity where a person is told, you must answer the questions. And -- and the distinctions is one is an inquisitional situation where if the officer has a person alone and they're forcing them to answer questions, there is no public trial, there is no judge there to make sure that they're -- they're not being -- there is no overreaching, there is no brow- beating. The person who was even under a grant of immunity can say, I'm not going to talk, and face the consequences of going to jail and sit in jail with dignity and say, I'm not going to talk. I believe that it's more important to assert my right not to speak than to be -- than -- than sitting in jail. Our law still doesn't allow the court or the jailers to use coercion to extract their statement. A person in this country still could have the dignity to say I don't want to speak and I'll take the punishment, and if it's just punishment, that it's been done by a court, then that is not coercion, the kind of inquisitional coercion that this -- that this Court and the United States has always said we don't tolerate. Are there any other questions?"

The danger in saying I agree with that hypothetical, Your Honor, is that what if the person is the wrong person. What if the suspect really isn't the person who kidnapped the person? What if they're just wrong and they got the wrong person? That's the danger, and that's why we have to --"

As I understand that case, it was a State legislative commission which accorded immunity to the witness under State law, but of course could not accord immunity under Federal law. And we held that the witness, nonetheless, had to testify, and we said, of course, if the feds try to use the evidence, it will not be admissible because it was -- it was obtained under coercion. But we, nonetheless, allowed the State to compel the testimony. Now, were we allowing a Fifth Amendment violation?"

And we said, nonetheless, the State could -- could lock the person up until he testified. And the only consequence would be that if he did testify, it would not be introducible in Federal trial because it -- it had been coerced. Now, I -- you know, it's a bizarre case, but it does seem to stand for the principle that Mr. Robbins asserts, which is that there's no Fifth Amendment violation until the evidence is introduced."

And -- and in that context there was a -- there was a discussion about -- that the -- that the -- that there was -- that because the rights protect outside of the criminal case and outside of the trial, that there was no -- there would be no deterrence. There would be no reason to enforce it at that point. Also there was Michigan versus Tucker. Both Michigan and -- and Colorado versus Colony -- Connelly both discuss about a two-part inquiry. Should -- should we -- and the Court indicates in both of those cases that there's an analysis of whether the police officer conduct violated the Fifth Amendment, and then secondly, what is the remedy. So really, those two cases talk about the difference between the right pre-trial in the custodial interrogation setting, as well as -- as does Miranda, and the difference between the remedies that the court considered.

    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. -- Justice Stevens. Let me just quickly make a couple of points. It seems to me that petitioner can win this case the hard way or the easy way. The easy way is recognizing that this body of law is, as one of the members said this morning, a complex of constitutional issues with cross currents that cut in a variety of directions, that in light of Verdugo Urquidez, in light of Sacramento against Lewis, it cannot be said that any of these constitutional principles was sufficiently clearly established to warrant the rejection of qualified immunity. But I want to win it the hard way. First, because under Sacramento against Lewis, the standard for substantive due process is intent to harm. That wasn't pled. That wasn't tried. There's no such argument before you today. No one thinks that if Sacramento against Lewis applies, there can be a substantive due process claim at all. That's why it wasn't in the complaint. And no one here before you is suggesting intent to harm. Now, on the Fifth Amendment, Justice Kennedy, I'd like to take one more crack at the concern that you've articulated because I think it is -- it is in fact possible to square those concerns with the holding in Murphy against Waterfront Commission which, as far as I can tell, is perfectly good law and consistent with what this Court said in footnote 8 of Balsys about the fail- safe of use immunity provided directly by the Fifth Amendment. So long as the government has not compromised the availability of use immunity under the Fifth Amendment, there hasn't been a Fifth Amendment violation. In each of the penalty cases that are suggested by your hypothetical, that's what the government has done. They have said to the witness, you may not have immunity. You may not assert your Fifth Amendment. If you assert your Fifth Amendment right, we're going to put you in lock-up right now. The Court has consistently said, you know, if you forfeit the use immunity and actually put a guy in jail because he insists on it, that's as good as use. That's a protection that stems from the Fifth Amendment itself. And that's -- that explains all of the so-called penalty cases. The police -- the Garrity case in New Jersey, the two Lefkowitz cases out of New York. That explains -- what is, in fact, going on there is someone is being punished or penalized for the assertion of a privilege, including the right against use. But as long as the fail-safe in the words -- Justice Souter, that you used in -- in footnote 8 of Balsys, as long as the fail-safe of use immunity has not been compromised, as it has not been in this case, there is not yet a full Fifth Amendment violation, which can only happen when there's a use in a criminal case. And that is exactly the point that this Court in Verdugo Urquidez said in the passage that the Ninth Circuit decided to call dictum and ignore. That was a big mistake. And on that ground alone, it's the Fifth Amendment portion of its decision --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBBINS",
    "speech": "Well, I -- I think because -- well, for one thing, the availability of use immunity is still there. What you -- what I think it would -- what I think -- what I think it would amount to is continued coercion of a statement which arguably at some threshold, once you cross it, does indeed become too coercive to render the statement admissible. But that's when the Fifth Amendment fail-safe steps in and says, you may not use it. That would violate the Fifth Amendment. But because the fail-safe wasn't compromised in this case, as it was in the line of cases suggested by Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, there cannot be a Fifth Amendment, and we don't even have to reach the question of qualified immunity."
