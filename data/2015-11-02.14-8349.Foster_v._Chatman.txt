3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Case 148349, Foster v. Chatman.

5             Mr. Bright.

6          ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. STEPHEN B. BRIGHT

7                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8             MR. BRIGHT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10             The prosecutors in this case came to court

11 on the morning of jury selection determined to strike

12 all the black prospective jurors.

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Bright, maybe

14 you could address first the  the question we raised on

15 Friday with respect to which court certiorari should be

16 directed to.

17             MR. BRIGHT:  Yes, Your Honor.

18             We filed this petition originally certiorari

19 to the Supreme Court of Georgia.  And of course this

20 Court in Sears v. Upton had issued certiorari  this is

21 in 2010  to the Supreme Court of Georgia in a similar

22 situation.

23             It appears to us, from looking at this over

24 the weekend, that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company v.

25 Durham County, which the Court has decided in eight 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
4 1 in 1986, the Court said that, unless there was positive 2 assurance that the decision was not a ruling on the 3 merits, then the writ went to the State supreme court. 4             And the Georgia court, while it has rules 5 and statutes and its own opinions that are not totally 6 in harmony with one another, the rule, nonetheless, is 7 that a certificate of probable cause, which is what was 8 denied in this case, is to be granted if there is 9 arguable merit to the case. 10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you think that 11 affects the scope of our review?  In other words, are we 12 addressing just whether there's arguable merit to the 13 claim or are we addressing the claim on its own merits? 14             MR. BRIGHT:  Well, I  I think what this 15 Court has done in  in all these cases is apply Yist v. 16 Nunnemaker to look through to the last reasoned 17 decision, and that would be the decision of the habeas 18 corpus court.  In Georgia, typically the habeas court 19 rules, an application is made for certificate of 20 probable cause to the Georgia Supreme Court, and that is 21 often denied summarily.  It is denied summarily as it 22 was in this case.  It was denied. 23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I really don't understand 24 that.  You  you say we would be reversing the Georgia 25 Supreme Court, not the  not the habeas court, right?
Alderson Reporting Company

1 And  and all that the Georgia Supreme Court held is

5

2 that there  there  is that there was no arguable

3 basis for  for its accepting review.

4             So if we reverse that decision, we  we

5 tell the Georgia Supreme Court, you're wrong; there is

6 an arguable basis for your accepting review.  So we

7 ought to remand to that court, requiring them to accept

8 review, it would seem to me.

9             How can we reverse them on  on an issue

10 they  they never considered?

11             MR. BRIGHT:  Well, that's what happened in

12 R.J. Reynolds.  I mean, there you had almost an

13 identical situation where you had an intermediate

14 appellate court that had ruled, and then you had the

15 North Carolina Supreme Court denied review.  And the

16 question was, do you issue the writ to the intermediate

17 appellate court or to the North Carolina Supreme Court?

18 And  and this Court decided, and Justice Blackman,

19 writing for the court, said, "We want to give

20 practitioners"  "We want to end the confusion about

21 this."

22             And so it goes to the State supreme court.

23             There is no difference in our situation here

24 and the situation that R.J. Reynolds 

25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But  but you're saying in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that case or in other cases?  And if so, which other

6

2 cases that, in that situation, we, nonetheless,

3 addressed the reasoning of the intermediate court?  Is

4 that what you're saying?

5             MR. BRIGHT:  You  you did in Sears v.

6 Upton, a case out of Georgia, 561 U.S. 945 in 2010.

7 That was certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia, but

8 it came up on exactly the same posture of our  our

9 case.

10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is there an argument that

11 the petition for certiorari could go to the trial court?

12             I mean, our statute says that it goes to the

13 highest court in which review could have  could have

14 been had, I think is the  the statutory phrase, in

15 which sounds like the Georgia Supreme Court.

16             On the other hand, as Justice Scalia said,

17 they haven't really directed their attention to the

18 issues before us.

19             I  I  I'm not sure to me that it's an

20 option to  to go to the superior  to the Georgia

21 trial court.

22             MR. BRIGHT:  Well, let 

23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or  or is that

24 incorrect?

25             MR. BRIGHT:  Well, what this Court has said,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 both in the R.J. Reynolds case and then that was

7

2 followed in Grady v. North Carolina last year  2015

3 case, this year, in which, once again, there was an

4 intermediate court decision denied by the  the North

5 Carolina Supreme Court.

6             I mean, I can remember all the way back to

7 1960.  There was Thompson v. Louisville, where

8 certiorari was to the police court in Louisville,

9 Kentucky, because no court in Kentucky could take the

10 case because the fine was less than $20.

11             But I think these cases, much more recent,

12 decided by the Court 1986 and this year 

13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You're putting together

14 two rules that you say we've established.  One is

15 Justice Blackman said, to end the confusion, the

16 petition should be addressed to the Supreme Court.

17             And then you said, we have cases.  Look

18 through cases.  If 

19             MR. BRIGHT:  Right.

20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   the Supreme Court has

21 said just "denied," nothing more than "denied," we look

22 back to the last reasoned decision.

23             Those are both decisions of this Court, and

24 that's what you're relying on.

25             MR. BRIGHT:  Well, and  and they're not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
8 1 mutually exclusive.  This Court can look back through to 2 the last reasoned decision in making its decision in 3 this case, and I believe that's what it should do.  But 4 at the same time, the Court's opinions appear to us, on 5 the quick research we did over the weekend on this, that 6 R.J. Reynolds and  and the subsequent case say that 7 certiorari would issue to the Georgia Supreme Court. 8             And  and we listed it that way, and then 9 when the case was docketed here, it was listed that the 10 lower court was the superior court of Butts County. 11             JUSTICE ALITO:  What if the State supreme 12 court wrote a short opinion and said, We're not going to 13 determine whether there was, in fact  the only issue 14 we're going to determine is whether there's any arguable 15 merit to this?  And then you say that the whole issue of 16 whether it was a correct application in Batson is  is 17 the issue that we have to decide? 18             MR. BRIGHT:  I  I  I think in 19 R.J. Reynolds, I think that's this Court's law, yes. 20             JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I ask you another  a 21 question about another preliminary issue before you get 22 to the  the  the underlying question in the case? 23             The Superior Court said, on page 175 of the 24 Joint Appendix, that the issue of the Batson violation 25 was not reviewable based on the doctrine of
Alderson Reporting Company

1 res judicata.

2             And then it later said, and this is 192 of

3 the Joint Appendix, that it will review the Batson claim

4 as to whether Petitioner has shown any change in the

5 facts sufficient to overcome the res judicata bar.

6             Now, if you put those two together, you

7 could argue that the superior court decided only a

8 question of State law, namely, whether the situation

9 here was such that there could be review of the Batson

10 claim.

11             What is your response to that?

12             MR. BRIGHT:  Well, the State doesn't argue

13 that.  And I think the reason for that is because the

14 Court said, we're moving  the Court is going to

15 address step three of Batson.  And it said, Foster's

16 Batson claim is without merit.

17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but is it question

18 of Federal or State law as to whether or not the

19 Petitioner has shown a change in facts sufficient to

20 overcome the res judicata bar?  The one  the page 192

21 language that Justice Alito quoted, is that  is that a

22 State law question or 

23             MR. BRIGHT:  That's a State law question.

24             And here 

25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1             MR. BRIGHT:   the Court decided it, but 2 I  I point out, Justice  3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if it's a State law 4 question and they resolved it against you, what do you 5 have to  then what do you have to argue? 6             MR. BRIGHT:  No, no, no. 7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I think you have to say 8 it's a Federal question. 9             MR. BRIGHT:  No.  In order to decide it, 10 the  this is exactly like Ake v. Oklahoma, where the 11 court, the Oklahoma court had to decide the Federal 12 question in order to decide whether it had jurisdiction 13 over the issue. 14             And this Court held in Ake that, where the 15 court has to decide the Federal issue  and it did in 16 this case.  It clearly decided the Federal issue and 17 felt that the  found that the Batson claim had no 18 merit.  So it is decided, the Federal issue, and there's 19 no contest about that in the  20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Explain to me why deciding 21 the Federal issue was essential to its deciding the 22 State res judicata issue. 23             MR. BRIGHT:  Because it  it  it framed 24 the question as being that it would look at the 25 Ake v.  excuse me  they would look at the Batson v.

1 Kentucky claim and that, if there was merit to that

11

2 claim, then the court would grant the writ on it.  On

3 the other hand, if it found that there was not merit on

4 it, then 

5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  There  you think it was

6 saying whether there's res judicata or not depends on

7 whether the new claim has any merit?

8             MR. BRIGHT:  I think  I think it's

9 exactly 

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a very strange

11 application of res judicata, it seems to me.

12             MR. BRIGHT:  Well 

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought it was whether

14 there  there were changed facts sufficient enough.

15             MR. BRIGHT:  Well, the Georgia law is that

16 you can bring an issue that's been litigated already

17 before direct appeal.

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  Right.

19             MR. BRIGHT:  In habeas, if there are 

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even  even  right.

21 Even if it would, you know, produce a different result,

22 right?

23             MR. BRIGHT:  Right.  If the  if the facts

24 are such that it would produce a different result,

25 right.

1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Bright, did the

12

2 court, in your judgment, do de novo review?  Didn't it

3 say that it did  basically, it was going to do step

4 three of the Batson charge  challenge?

5             MR. BRIGHT:  Yes, that's exactly what the

6 court said, yes.

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that's a ruling on

8 the merits.

9             MR. BRIGHT:  I think  I think the court

10 said the Batson claim is without merit.  That seems like

11 a ruling on the merits to me.

12             (Laughter.)

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, it  I think it

14 said after  after redoing 

15             MR. BRIGHT:  After considering these other

16 facts.  And we think there was some legal errors made

17 there.  But yes, after considering these facts, the

18 court said that the claim was without merit.

19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The court said that it

20 would reach step three again on the basis of the new

21 evidence presented, and so they did it all over.  And I

22 guess that's  we must take that as what happened.

23 They did not apply a res judicata bar.

24             MR. BRIGHT:  No.  I mean, in Ake this Court

25 said, when the resolution of the State procedural law

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
13 1 question depends upon a Federal constitutional ruling, 2 the State law prong is not independent of the Federal 3 claim.  And this Court has jurisdiction.  That's on page 4 75 of 47 United States. 5             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I don't want to 6 belabor the point too much, but you  are you arguing 7 that Georgia res judicata law is this:  If someone comes 8 up with any new fact, the  the  the thinnest new 9 fact, that is sufficient to wipe out the res judicata 10 bar and allow the court to get to the merits of the 11 claim?  Is that your argument?  That's your 12 understanding of Georgia res judicata law? 13             MR. BRIGHT:  That's not my understanding. 14 My understanding is the evidence has to be sufficient 15 enough that the court does what it did in this case and 16 rule on the merits of the issue.  And that's what 17 happened here.  This was not a matter of just adding one 18 more leaf to the basket. 19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And we really want you to 20 get to the merits, but why is that  in conjunction 21 with  22             MR. BRIGHT:  We will. 23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   with Justice Scalia's 24 question, why is that an issue of Federal law? 25             MR. BRIGHT:  Because the court decided the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1 Batson issue to decide the underlying State law issue. 2 And I think Ake is pretty clear on this, and I commend 3 it to the Court's attention.  We didn't  it wasn't  4 since the State had raised this, either in their 5 opposition to cert or in their brief, it's not briefed 6 before this Court, but I think that's the deciding case 7 on this. 8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thanks, counsel.  I 9 think we have your argument on the point.  Thank you. 10             MR. BRIGHT:  Okay.  Thank you very much. 11             If I could just say what happened here was 12 that the prosecutors had identified the 13 AfricanAmericans by race, they had rated them against 14 each other in case it came down to having to select a 15 black juror. 16             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The prosecutors said the 17 reason for concentrating on the black jurors was that 18 you had informed them you would present a Batson 19 challenge, and therefore, it was necessary for them to 20 see if there was a raceneutral ground for disqualifying 21 that case. 22             MR. BRIGHT:  Right.  Two answers to that, 23 Justice Ginsburg. 24             I mean, what the lawyers did here was these 25 lawyers have practiced here for a long time in Rome,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
15 1 Georgia.  They said the prosecutor always strikes all 2 the blacks from the jury.  That's been the historic 3 practice.  We think they're going to strike all the 4 blacks on the jury in our case.  But last year the 5 Supreme Court of the United States decided Batson v. 6 Kentucky, and we asked the Court not to let that happen 7 in this case. 8             Now, of course, if the prosecutor is willing 9 to avoid a Batson challenge, they could have not 10 discriminated.  That would have been the first thing to 11 do. 12             But  but secondly, with regard to the 13 information that's collected here, it doesn't seem like 14 it's information just to exercise strikes when they say, 15 if it comes down to having to take an AfricanAmerican, 16 Ms. Hardge, or in another place, Ms. Garrett, might be 17 okay.  And the district attorney himself said Marilyn 18 Garrett has the most potential of the black prospective 19 jurors. 20             In other words, the blacks were taken out of 21 the picture here.  They were taken and  and dealt with 22 separately.  And over the weekend, the jury  the 23 questioning ended on a Friday.  And the judge said, all 24 right.  Over the weekend, you've got your chance to 25 decide who you're going to strike.  And they knew
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 exactly who they were going to strike because the 

16

2 the  the jurors are listed in order.  The State goes

3 first, and if it accepts a juror, then the State

4 accepts, and that juror is on.  There's no going back.

5 There's no backstriking or there's no striking people

6 here and there.

7             They developed three strike lists.  And one

8 of those strike lists was a list headed "Definite NOs."

9 These are the people absolutely are not going to be on

10 this jury.  There are only six jurors listed on the list

11 of "Definite NOs," and the first five are

12 AfricanAmericans.  The sixth is a juror who made clear

13 during the voir dire process that she could not impose

14 the death penalty under any circumstances.  The State

15 moved to strike her for cause.  The judge probably erred

16 in not granting that strike.  But even she ranked behind

17 the black jurors in terms of the priorities that the

18 prosecution had for  for striking.

19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, at this 

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Bright 

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   at the time,

22 Mr. Lanier said they weren't striking the  the jurors

23 because of race.  They were striking them because they

24 were women.  And I guess three  three out of the

25 four

17

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   AfricanAmericans

3 were  who were struck were  were women.  How does

4 that  and then that explanation is just kind of fallen

5 out of the case.

6             How  how does that affect the analysis?

7             MR. BRIGHT:  Well, he  he did accept

8 women, though, as  as well.  If  bear with me a 

9 just a moment.

10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The Court had not yet

11 held that Batson applies to 

12             MR. BRIGHT:  The Court had not held in JEB

13 that Batson applied to women, but the Court did say in

14 JEB that, of course, it could be used as a pretext,

15 women, for striking on the basis of race.

16             In this case, the prosecutor struck three

17 white jurors, and then he struck the three black jurors,

18 women, the three black women and the three white women.

19 The final 

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Mr. Bright,

21 Mr. Lanier 

22             MR. BRIGHT:  Yes.

23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   answered yes when he

24 asked  when during the  during the trial when he was

25 asked whether he had done  I don't know if it  oh,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 no, it was on the motion for a new trial hearing 

18

2 whether he had done the same extensive background check

3 on all the jurors, white and black.

4             Did you find any evidence of that extensive

5 black background search?

6             MR. BRIGHT:  No.  The only  what that's

7 talking about  and  and the investigator said this

8 in his deposition, was the color  racecoded colored

9 list, those first four lists you have in the Joint

10 Appendix in which the blacks are marked with a "B" and

11 are highlighted in green with a marker up at the corner

12 saying green designates black.

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So  so your  your

14 understanding of that statement was that all  he had

15 only done an extensive search on the blacks on the list?

16             MR. BRIGHT:  Well, it's clear, Mr. Lundy had

17 prepared a  a list, notes in which he talked about

18 just the black jurors in  in the case.  And I think

19 the State concedes in its brief that the focus was on

20 the black jurors.

21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  During the trial, did

22 defense counsel, when he made his initial Batson

23 challenge  not in the papers, but at trial  did he

24 again say that this was part and parcel of the

25 prosecutor's pattern?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
19 1             MR. BRIGHT:  He didn't say that, but I point 2 this interesting thing out.  When they discussed the 3 Batson motion before trial, there was never a suggestion 4 that there wouldn't be a Batson hearing.  Everybody knew 5 what was going to happen, that all the blacks would be 6 struck, and then they'd have a hearing after that 7 happened.  But the defense had basically put their 8 motion in writing and relied upon that throughout the 9 jury selection. 10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I was just surprised 11 that we didn't hear about this preparation for a Batson 12 hearing until  13             MR. BRIGHT:  Well  14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   the habeas. 15             MR. BRIGHT:  The  the defense lawyers at 16 trial did move for the prosecution's notes.  And the 17 prosecution opposed that.  They're very strict in not  18 not giving up their notes.  Then when the prosecutor 19 testified on the motion for a new trial, he did 20 something I've never seen a lawyer do before.  He cut a 21 bargain, sort of, with the judge and the lawyer saying, 22 I will testify, but only if I don't have to show them my 23 notes. 24             I mean, basic rules of evidence are you 25 testify and rely upon notes; the other side can see the

20 1 notes.  But here, these notes were guarded until 2006, 2 when we obtained them through a Freedom of Information 3 or what they call Open Records Act in Georgia. 4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The prosecutors said that 5 you  they said, we never  we never wrote or 6 authorized or relied on those notes.  And you didn't 7 call the prosecutors to test the veracity of that 8 assertion. 9             MR. BRIGHT:  No, but all the prosecutor 10 talked about were the colorhighlighted notes.  Each 11 prosecutor filed an affidavit which are in the  in the 12 Joint Appendix at 168.  And all they said was, we didn't 13 highlight it in green, and we didn't tell anybody else 14 to highlight it in green.  And then Mr. Lanier says  15 and I don't have anything else to say beyond what I said 16 at the Batson hearing and the motion for a new trial. 17 Mr. Pullen said  the only other thing he said is, I 18 didn't use those greenhighlighted lists in choosing the 19 jury; but, of course, that's just the first few pages. 20             What's damning about this is not so much 21 that, but the "Definite NOs" list, the misrepresentation 22 to the trial court that Ms. Garrett  that they wanted 23 Ms. Garrett.  That's what they told the trial court. 24 And the trial court relied upon that in denying the 25 Batson motion, that this showed their openness to

1 having  Ms. Garrett was on the "Definite NO" list.

21

2 She was on each of the strike lists.  Ms. Garrett was

3 never in the running to be on this jury.

4             But they represented to the court that

5 because another AfricanAmerican, Shirley Powell, was

6 excused for cause  there were five AfricanAmericans

7 in the venire at the start when they got ready to

8 instruct the jury.  But one said, turns out I know

9 somebody in the family.  She was excused for cause.  And

10 the prosecutors said  made it  implied clearly that

11 had it not been for that, that extra strike, that

12 Ms. Garrett would have sat.

13             At the same time  and they're still

14 arguing this both ways, that they both wanted her and

15 didn't want her  they give eleven reasons for why

16 Ms. Garrett would not be a good juror.  That she's

17 impudent and she doesn't respect the court.  If you

18 believe all the things they said about her, they would

19 never want her as a juror.

20             But those things, I would submit, are not

21 really valid in terms of  in terms of the reasons,

22 because the reasons they gave here, many were

23 demonstrably false and not supported by the evidence,

24 including reasons they gave about Ms. Garrett.  They

25 were inconsistent, some were completely incredible, and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 they applied to white jurors  some of these reasons 2 applied to white jurors who had the same characteristics 3 as the AfricanAmericans who were struck. 4             And then lastly, and what's so important 5 under MillerEl, they didn't question the jurors about 6 the reasons for striking them.  They gave reasons for 7 striking, and one question would have cleared up some of 8 these.  And MillerEl says that the failure to engage in 9 any meaningful voir dire about whatever your reason is, 10 is evidence suggesting that the explanation is a sham 11 and a pretext. 12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Bright  13             MR. BRIGHT:  And  14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   I have found some 15 circuit courts who have a rule on appeal or on habeas 16 which is if they can find one legitimate reason for 17 striking a juror  18             MR. BRIGHT:  Yes. 19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   that's enough to 20 defeat a Batson challenge.  Do you believe that's an 21 appropriate rule?  Are you suggesting a different 22 approach to the question? 23             MR. BRIGHT:  Well, it can't  I  I would 24 suggest it  it can't possibly be.  Because this Court 25 said in Justice Alito's opinion in Snyder v. Louisiana
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
23 1 that where the peremptory strike was shown to have been 2 motivated in substantial part by race, that it could not 3 be sustained.  And  excuse me  I  I would suggest 4 to you, it shouldn't even really say substantial. 5 Because if this Court, as it said so many times, is 6 engaged in unceasing efforts to end race discrimination 7 in the criminal courts, then a strike that  strikes 8 motivated by race cannot be tolerable. 9             And, of course, as  as pointed out here in 10 the  in the amici, this is a serious problem, not just 11 in this case, but in other cases where people come to 12 court with their canned reasons and just read them off. 13 That happened in this case, where one of the reasons 14 that was given was just taken verbatim out of a   two 15 of the reasons given were taken verbatim out of a 16 reported case.  So you don't have the reason for the 17 lawyer in this case.  He said my personal preference. 18 It wasn't his personal preference.  It was the personal 19 preference of some U.S. attorney in Mississippi who gave 20 that reason, and then it was upheld on appeal by  by 21 the Fifth Circuit. 22             But I  we would suggest that the standard 23 is at least what Snyder says, because when you have 24 both  you can always have, as MillerEl recognized  25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, in  in response to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Justice Sotomayor's question 

24

2             MR. BRIGHT:  Right.

3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   if the prosecutor

4 argues a laundry list of reasons for striking the black

5 juror and some of those are reasonable and some are

6 implausible, how should the Court approach the Batson

7 analysis?

8             MR. BRIGHT:  I think the Court looks at

9 which reasons are pretextual.  I think the fact that

10 there is a laundry list suggests in and of itself that

11 the Court should scrutinize the reasons very carefully,

12 should be suspect of the reasons.  Because otherwise,

13 what the Court is going to do is just simply encourage

14 prosecutors or any party in a case, since Batson applies

15 to everyone  is going to encourage a party to just

16 give as many reasons as possible and hope that one will

17 be acceptable.  And in this case 

18             JUSTICE ALITO:  Don't you think this is 

19 this is a casebycase thing?  Suppose there's one

20 reason that's a killer reason?  Like this  this

21 individual has numerous prior felony convictions, all

22 right?  And then the prosecutor says in addition, and

23 this  this person didn't  he looked down at the

24 floor in answering the questions and didn't seem to

25 pause and didn't seem to understand some of the

Alderson Reporting Company

1 questions.

Official

25

2             So under a circumstance like that, couldn't

3 the Court say, well, the one  there's one reason here

4 that would  that is clearly a justification for a

5 peremptory strike?  We don't have to determine whether

6 there's evidence that the person was looking down at the

7 floor.

8             MR. BRIGHT:  Well, of course, Batson says,

9 and the subsequent cases say, you look at all relevant

10 circumstances.  It may be if all the circumstances that

11 are there, the ones you said, then you would come to the

12 conclusion that of those two reasons that there was a

13 valid reason.

14             But I would suggest that where you have

15 indicia like we have here, I mean, we have an arsenal of

16 smoking guns in this case.

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  A lot of those smoking guns

18 were in the original decisions by  by the Georgia

19 courts.  It seems to me what  what you would have to

20 establish to reverse the Georgia courts is that the new

21 smoking gun, assuming that all the rest were not enough

22 to demonstrate a Batson violation  the new smoking

23 guns would tip the scale.  Isn't  isn't that the

24 issue 

25             MR. BRIGHT:  Well, when the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
26 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  that the Georgia courts 2 decided? 3             MR. BRIGHT:  When the  when the new 4 smoking gun tells you that the prosecutor misrepresented 5 facts and gave reasons that were absolutely false, 6 demonstrably false reasons, and those are not clear 7 before, but you have that now, I mean, Batson turns on 8 the feasibility of the reasons.  It turns on the 9 credibility of the prosecutor. 10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but all  all I'm 11 saying  and you seem to be agreeing  is that it is 12 not the overall Batson judgment that's before us but 13 rather the judgment that the  that the new evidence 14 did not suffice to create a Batson violation where none 15 existed before. 16             MR. BRIGHT:  No.  Our position is that when 17 you look at the new evidence with all the evidence at 18 trial, that all relevant circumstances considered 19 together, considering that a lot of these reasons we now 20 know from the notes, we now know from the notes that 21 there were misrepresentations with regard to these 22 reasons. 23             I mean, the Georgia Supreme Court  just as 24 an example, Justice Scalia  upheld the strike on 25 Ms. Garrett on two bases:  That she was a social worker
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
27 1 and that her cousin had been arrested for drugs.  She 2 was not a social worker, and secondly, the prosecutor 3 didn't find out until after trial about her cousin's 4 arrest, so it couldn't have possibly been a reason for 5 the strike. 6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you saying in answer 7 to Justice Scalia that when you had the notes, those 8 notes cast doubt on some of the prosecutor's 9 justifications in the first round? 10             MR. BRIGHT:  They  they do that, and  11 and they show misrepresentations to the court, and they 12 show an overarching goal of separating out the 13 AfricanAmerican citizens, treating them differently and 14 then putting them on this list of "Definite NOs." 15             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And Mr. Bright, just to make 16 sure I understand, all the notes in the prosecutor's 17 files were new; is that right? 18             MR. BRIGHT:  New.  New to this case, yes. 19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  Okay. 20             MR. BRIGHT:  And there were three people: 21 It just involved the two prosecutors and the 22 investigator who put those together. 23             I'd like to reserve the balance of my time. 24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 25             Ms. Burton.

2                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3             MS. BURTON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

4 please the Court:

5             I believe there are two important factors in

6 this case when reviewing the entirety of the evidence.

7 One is Petitioner bears the burden of establishing

8 clear 

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I  I'll ask you as

10 well to address the certiorari question first.

11             MS. BURTON:  And  and respectfully, I

12 disagree with Petitioner's counsel on this issue.  I

13 believe Norfolk & Western Railway v. Hiles, which is

14 this Court's opinion, indicates that  or states that

15 if there is an issue raised in the lower court and it is

16 raised in the State's highest court, in this case, the

17 Georgia Supreme Court, but the Georgia Supreme Court

18 denies discretionary review, then it is before this

19 Court on certiorari from the lower court.  So 

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the problem is I

21 don't think this is discretionary review.  The Eleventh

22 Circuit found it's not under Georgia law.  Read its

23 opinion.  It seems pretty grounded in the stated law of

24 Georgia.

25             MS. BURTON:  Yes, Your Honor, and that is 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 that's a pretty hotbutton issue I know right now in the 2 State Federal courts in Georgia.  But our position in 3 that  in that  those cases and in  I think there 4 was a case before this Court on rehearing on that same 5 issue  is that Georgia statute  the Georgia statute 6 specifically says that is a discretionary appeal.  The 7 1975 Habeas Corpus Act made it a discretionary appeal, I 8 think, because the Georgia Supreme Court was just 9 getting inundated with appeal after appeal. 10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And has the Georgia Supreme 11 Court ever  ever said anything one way or the other as 12 to whether it's discretionary or not? 13             MS. BURTON:  In two of their cases, Reed v. 14 Hopper, which is 219 S.E.2d 409, and Smith v. Nichols, 15 which is 270 S.E.2d 550, 1999.  They both state those as 16 discretionary.  But they have not  they have not 17 answered a  a certified question on that issue. 18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you give me the  19 the Reed v.  what? 20             MS. BURTON:  Yes, Your Honor.  219 S.E.2d 21 409.  That's a 1975 case. 22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are certified questions 23 available in Georgia?

4 says in a habeas case, State habeas, that the Georgia

5 Supreme Court must review it.  It says it must review it

6 unless it's without merit.  I forget the exact words.  I

7 was looking for them.

8             MS. BURTON:  Well, the  in State habeas 

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  Do they state that?

10             MS. BURTON:  Well, in the State habeas, I

11 think it's 91452 

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

13             MS. BURTON:   the statute takes State

14 habeas cases out of other appellate review and makes

15 that just discretionary.  The Georgia Supreme Court 

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, wait, wait, wait.

17 Then I've been looking at the wrong place.

18             You heard your brother here say  he quoted

19 some words.  I don't remember the exact words, but they

20 were exactly what I'd read, and it was from a statute in

21 Georgia.

6 I'm saying?

7             MS. BURTON:  It  it does ring a bell.

8             JUSTICE BREYER:  Or what are the exact

9 words?

10             MS. BURTON:  I  I  I do not know the

11 exact words.  But I believe the 

12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The exact words are

13 that a certificate of probable cause will be issued when

14 there is arguable merit.

15             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  That's it.

16             MS. BURTON:  But I believe that's Rule 36 of

17 the Georgia Supreme Court.

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  Right  that

19 doesn't

3 that the Chief Justice just read from Georgia law govern

4 this case?  The answer is yes or no.

5             MS. BURTON:  I  no, I believe it's

6 discretionary.

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  They do not govern this

8 case.

9             MS. BURTON:  I believe the State 

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  What, in your

11 opinion, is the Georgia statute that says that those

12 words you just held do not govern this case?

13             MS. BURTON:  I believe it's  and  and

14 correct.  I  I'm certainly open to correction.

15 191452 states that State habeas is taken out of other

16 appeals, which are normally directly appeals, or

17 prisoner appeals, and they are discretionary.

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Thank you.

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I  I suppose

20 that  that  that a court could have a discretionary

21 view but could provide by rule that, in the exercise of

22 our discretion, we will grant any of these unless it's

23 patently wrong.

24             Could  couldn't  and  is  maybe

25 that's what's happened here.  And if  if you use your

1 discretion to enact a rule which says you will take

33

2 cases of a certain court, does  does the taking of

5             (Laughter.)

6             MS. BURTON:  I think the  I think the

7 taking of the case does remain discretionary.  If they

8 find it has arguable merit, it is discretionary.  And 

9 and the two cases I cited specifically reference 

10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, why would we 

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You've  you've just

12 decided that you will uniformly exercise your discretion

13 in a certain way.

14             MS. BURTON:  Correct.

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.

16             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But  but I  maybe I'm

17 misunderstanding what you're saying.  You're saying

18 there is no such uniform determination that they will

19 exercise their discretion in a certain way, that they

20 are insisting upon their discretion being discretionary.

21 Is that correct?

22             (Laughter.)

23             MS. BURTON:  That is  that is my

24 understanding.  Because these  this  this law

3 confused I can't even 

4             (Laughter.)

5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The State habeas process

6 is different than the regular appeal process.

7             MS. BURTON:  That's correct.

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  On the regular appeal

9 process, they look at each case  each case with

10 discretion.

11             MS. BURTON:  On a direct appeal process,

12 it  it  and certainly a capital case, it is

13 mandatory review.

14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay.  In State habeas

15 they have a rule, an internal rule that says, we'll take

16 every habeas case unless it's  has no arguable merit,

17 right?

18             MS. BURTON:  I  if I may rephrase:  I

19 think the rule says that they will take a case if it has

20 arguable merit.  Generally they would not take 

21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In the positive.

22             MS. BURTON:  Right, right.

23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what would lend us to

24 believe that they didn't look at the merits and say

25 there was no arguable merit?  That they just said, we're

1 too busy.  We don't care if there is arguable merit.

35

2             Do you believe they did that?

4 say they were too busy to take the case.

5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  What?

6             MS. BURTON:  But  I said I would never say

7 they were too  that that would be the reason.

8             But I think they would say, we've looked at

9 this case  because they do have the records before

10 them  and we don't see arguable merit to take this up.

11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that is a decision on

12 the merits.  There is no arguable merits.

13             MS. BURTON:  I think it is a fine  there

14 is no arguable merit to the application that there has

15 been error below.

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay.

17             MS. BURTON:  If that makes it any clearer.

8 this is an issue that's being litigated in the Georgia

9 courts, is that right, in the Eleventh Circuit?

10             MS. BURTON:  That is correct.

11             JUSTICE KAGAN:  This precise issue?

12             MS. BURTON:  This  this issue.

13             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Thank you.

14             MS. BURTON:  To 

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What  what issue is that?

16             MS. BURTON:  The 

17             (Laughter.)

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it  is it the issue of

19 which court the certiorari should be directed to?

20             MS. BURTON:  Well, I  I  it's  it's 

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The issue of what?  What is

22 the issue that is being litigated?

23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I'll  I'll  am I

24 right that the issue that is being litigated is whether

25 the Supreme Court review, in cases like this, is

2             MS. BURTON:  That is correct.

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.

4             MS. BURTON:  And in those cases, obviously,

5 it's coming up from Federal court.  So we're dealing

6 more with Elst and Richter  Harrison  Harrington v.

7 Richter in  in a  in a sort of a different scope of

8 things in that regard.

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And this question is in

10 both the Georgia Supreme Court and in the Eleventh

11 Circuit?

12             MS. BURTON:  It is  it is currently in the

13 Eleventh Circuit.  I don't believe we have a case

14 pending now in the Georgia Supreme Court on that

15 particular issue.  But I  I do believe it's up 

16 there is an issue up here in a case, Jones v. Chatman,

17 where it is they've asked for rehearing on the issue 

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you think this would be

19 an appropriate case for us to exercise our discretion to

20 certify the question to the Supreme Court?

21             MS. BURTON:  We would certainly like an

22 answer from the Georgia Supreme Court on that issue.  I

23 think  I think the Eleventh Circuit would like that

24 as  as well.  I think it would clear up both State and

25 Federal law for  for a number of things.

38 1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There's a statute that 2 permits the  the Georgia Supreme Court to accept 3 certified questions.  Do you know anything about the 4 history of requests for certification? 5             Some states have such a process, but the 6 State supreme court rejects the question. 7             MS. BURTON:  I do not, Your Honor.  And I  8 I apologize for that. 9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What  what if we hold in 10 this case that it is not discretionary review, and then, 11 in these cases that are pending, the Georgia Supreme 12 Court says it is discretionary review?  Who wins? 13             (Laughter.) 14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it ultimately a question 15 for us or for the Georgia Supreme Court? 16             MS. BURTON:  I think it's ultimately a 17 question for the Georgia Supreme Court as to what  18 what their law is, what the State law is. 19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why? 20             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Me too. 21             Can I  can I go to the merits?  Is that  22 is that all right? 23             MS. BURTON:  Sure. 24             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  Unless other 25 people

2             Look.  You have a lot of new information

3 here from these files that suggests that what the

4 prosecutors were doing was looking at the

5 AfricanAmerican prospective jurors as a group, that

6 they had basically said, we don't want any of these

7 people.  Here is the one we want if we really have to

8 take one.  But that there  the  all the evidence

9 suggests a kind of singling out, which is the very

10 antithesis of the Batson rule.

11             So, you know, I mean  well, isn't this

12 as  I'm just going to ask you:  Isn't this as clear a

13 Batson violation as a court is ever going to see?

14             MS. BURTON:  I don't think it is.  And I

15 think, because these notes that we have, they don't

16 undermine any of the findings that were given by the

17 prosecutor in his strikes, particularly of Mr. 

18 Mr. Hood and Ms. Garrett.

19             They certainly can be interpreted in two

20 ways.  In  in our response brief to this Court  we

21 don't know when we say, you know, this is why these

22 highlights are there.  There is a reasonable

23 explanation, just as Mr. Foster is given speculation in

24 his arguments.  We don't know.

25             But when they're 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the reasonable

40

2 explanation?

3             MS. BURTON:  The reasonable explanation in

4 this case is, four months prior to trial, as was

5 previously argued, Batson had just come out.  Batson is

6 new.  Four months prior to trial, defense counsel files

7 a motion and says, the strike of any black juror, we're

8 filing a Batson challenge.  Two weeks prior to trial, he

9 says  he files a motion and says, I'm  there's

10 racial disparity in 179 jurors.  And that's the 

11 that's the list that's challenged, the 179.  There is

12 racial disparity of black prospective jurors on that

13 list.

14             The day of trial, he refiles that.  So I

15 would be more surprised, quite frankly, if there wasn't

16 some sort of highlighting, or if 

17             JUSTICE BREYER:  In other words, the

18 argument you're making here 

19             MS. BURTON:  Exactly.

20             JUSTICE BREYER:   is that  is that the

21 reason he highlighted all the black jurors in green and

22 thus said black  what about the black jurors and did

23 all these different things was because he was preparing

24 a defense in case of a Batson challenge.

25             MS. BURTON:  Correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
41 1             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, if that's 2 correct, why this is  is this the first  is it  3 was this argument made before your main brief in this 4 case? 5             MS. BURTON:  And it was not  6             JUSTICE BREYER?  It's been several years. 7 Yes or no? 8             MS. BURTON:  And it was not.  And that's  9 and  10             JUSTICE BREYER:  It was not. 11             So if that had been his real reason, well, 12 isn't it a little surprising that he never thought of 13 it  14             (Laughter.) 15             JUSTICE BREYER:  or didn't tell anybody 16 until you raise this argument in your main brief? 17             MS. BURTON:  And  and I  I would  I 18 would say that's on State habeas counsel.  We relied on 19 our res judicata bar throughout State habeas; and then 20 after that, basically defended the factual findings of 21 the State habeas. 22             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  It seems to me 23 you have two arguments. 24             One is this argument that he never thought 25 of, apparently, or at least never thought to tell you
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
42 1 until quite recently.  And the other, after years, and 2 so it's hard to believe that's his real reason. 3             And then there's the second argument that he 4 had about 40 different reasons.  And at least some of 5 them could be valid.  Okay. 6             Now, if my grandson tells me, I don't want 7 to watch  I don't want to do my homework tonight at 8 7:00 because I'm just so tired.  And besides, I promised 9 my friend I'd play basketball.  And besides that, 10 there's a great program on television.  And besides 11 that, you know, I really  my stomach is upset, but I 12 want to eat spaghetti.  And so he's now given me five 13 different reasons. 14             What do I think of those reasons? 15             MS. BURTON:  Well, in this case  and 16 again, I think this is  17             JUSTICE BREYER:  One may be valid. 18             MS. BURTON:  Correct, and the other ones 19 also may be  20             JUSTICE BREYER:  Which one? 21             MS. BURTON:  Well, they all may be valid, 22 but they all may not be as strong as  as the  as the 23 first one.  But in this case, I think the important 24 part  25             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, wait.  The point is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
43 1 he gave 40 different reasons.  And the very fact that he 2 gives 40 different reasons  and many of them are 3 selfcontradictory, obviously not applicable, totally 4 different from  you know, that's why I used my 5 grandchild's analogy.  All right? 6             And so I would say my answer to my 7 grandchild is, look, you're not too tired to do your 8 homework.  And I think any reasonable person looking at 9 this would say, no, his reason was a purpose to 10 discriminate on the basis of race. 11             Now, tell me why I'm wrong. 12             MS. BURTON:  I think because you have to 13 look at the time period this was done.  This was done 14 not  you know, a year after Batson came out.  And even 15 throughout the transcript, people  defense counsel and 16 the prosecutor says, we're  we don't really know where 17 Batson is going. 18             So in this case, the prosecutor, dealing 19 with Batson for the first time, the first time in 20 history anybody has had to put strikes on the record. 21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But he's simply wrong.  He 22 puts down, if it comes  if it comes down to having to 23 pick one of the black jurors  was it Ms. Garrett?  24 might be okay. 25             MS. BURTON:  And that's  that's Mr. Lundy.

1 That's the investigator.

44

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So it  it  it  well,

3 but that seems to me to undercut the argument, well,

4 they're just feeling their way and so forth.  They've 

5 they've made a mistake  they've made a mistake of 

6 in Batson.  Sure it was new; but they're wrong.

7             MS. BURTON:  Well, first let me say, I think

8 that's why there was a laundry list because he was just

9 espousing every reason he had.  But with regard to

10 Mr. Lundy's, notes, and that was the investigator who

11 said if we have to choose a black juror, she may be the

12 best one.

13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who was responsible for

14 the definite no list?

15             MS. BURTON:  The definite no list, nobody 

16 the only person that was asked about that was Mr. Lundy,

17 who was deposed and said he could not identify who wrote

18 that list.  So we don't 

19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There are only three

20 possible choices.

21             MS. BURTON:  We  right.  We know it came

22 from the D.A.'s office.

23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And it  and it

24 exists  the paper exists.  It says "Definite NO."

25             MS. BURTON:  Correct.  And I don't think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 that is  I don't think that was a ranking of jurors, 2 because when you look, they did score jurors throughout. 3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there were five 4 AfricanAmerican jurors  5             MS. BURTON:  Correct. 6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:   on the definite  7 well, one of them was Garrett  this  as was pointed 8 out.  They said, if we have to have one, let it be 9 Garrett.  But Garrett then shows up on the definite no 10 list. 11             MS. BURTON:  Correct.  And  12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Were we told that the 13 only three people who did the investigation on Batson 14 were the two prosecutors on the case and Mr. Lundy?  So 15 if Mr. Lundy says I didn't make that list, it has to be 16 one of the two prosecutors. 17             MS. BURTON:  It has to be one of the two 18 prosecutors, and one was not there on the day it was 19 struck  the jury was struck; only Mr. Lanier was.  But 20 if that's not Mr. Lanier's thought process of this 21 definite  this definite no list  and I don't see 22 that that gets you to clear error in the striking of 23 Mr. Hood or Ms. Garrett. 24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you do with 25 other  I mean, it just  it seems an outandout
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1 false statement.  The reason that's given  one of the 2 reasons for Garrett's being struck is that her cousin 3 was arrested.  But then the prosecutor doesn't know that 4 at the time of the voir dire.  He doesn't know until 5 after the voir dire that the cousin was arrested.  So 6 how could it possibly be a reason at the time of the 7 voir dire? 8             MS. BURTON:  And I don't think the record 9 bears that out.  These notes  the highlighted notes 10 that Petitioner wants to say, these were used during 11 voir dire, these were using during the strikes, in those 12 notes  and this is at Joint Appendix page 256  13 Angela is written out beside Ms. Garrett's name.  In 14 Mr. Lundy's notes where he said he wrote down things he 15 knew prior to the strikes, prior to voir dire of what he 16 knew about individual jurors, he wrote down as to 17 Marilyn Garrett, Angela Garrett is a cousin.  So  and 18 then, Mr. Lanier testified  19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Didn't the habeas 20 court  21             JUSTICE ALITO:  Did Mr. Lanier testify  22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice. 23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   provide an excuse and 24 say  I'm sorry. 25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, you.

47 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Didn't the habeas court 2 accept that he didn't know at the time of trial, but he 3 just knew that Lundy didn't want her? 4             MS. BURTON:  The  what the  the habeas 5 court actually credited the fact that Mr. Lundy had 6 advised trial counsel that Angela Garrett should be 7 struck. 8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that was his 9 explanation for why the prosecutor didn't know about the 10 prior arrest, correct? 11             MS. BURTON:  No, I think the  I think the 12 State habeas court credited that as one of the facts of 13 the strike. 14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That Mr. Lundy didn't 15 want her. 16             MS. BURTON:  Excuse me, I  17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That Mr. Lundy didn't 18 want her.  He never credited or never said that he knew 19 this  that he knew about the arrest. 20             MS. BURTON:  Mr.  actually, Mr. Lanier 21 testified twice, though, that he was aware at the time 22 of jury selection that he knew about  23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Lundy did, but the 24 prosecutor didn't. 25             MS. BURTON:  Well, no.  In the motion for a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
48 1 new trial that Mr. Lanier  the prosecutor testified 2 and said, I knew during voir dire; Mr. Lundy told me 3 that.  That's at Joint Appendix 105 and 112, that he 4 knew  5             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, didn't he also 6 testify  this is on 14 of the reply brief  it has 7 come to our attention since the trial of this case that 8 Angela Garrett was arrested? 9             MS. BURTON:  It says on  on that page of 10 the  on that part of the transcript, which I  I 11 cannot explain to you in  in contrast to in the notes, 12 it is noted that she is the cousin prior to the jury 13 selection, unless that means  and I've read it several 14 times  since that time she's been dismissed from her 15 job.  Again, it's unclear as  16             JUSTICE ALITO:  What about the  what about 17 the giving a reason for dismissing her that she was 18 close in age to the defendant? 19             MS. BURTON:  When  and the  20             JUSTICE ALITO:  She was in her 30s.  He was 21 18 or 19. 22             MS. BURTON:  And when he initially 23 strikes  when Mr. Lanier initially explains his 24 strikes, he does state her age, so he is not trying to 25 say she's 23.  He states her age as 34.  And throughout,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the overall theme was, we don't want younger jurors.

49

2 We're looking for older jurors closer to the age of the

3 victim, age 79.

4             So I think  you know, maybe  I know it's

5 not  not the most articulate framing of it, but I

6 think it's more of a generational, she was younger.  And

7 that, the age, I don't think was a makeorbreak factor.

8 Working at Head Start with underprivileged children, a

9 makeorbreak factor; a similarly situated white juror

10 also struck for that same purpose.

11             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But  but Ms. Burton, I

12 mean, wouldn't you agree, in a lot of these Batson

13 cases, you'll have purported justifications, which they

14 could support a valid peremptory strike, right?  But

15 that the question for a court is, well, but did they

16 support this valid peremptory strike?  In other words,

17 what was the prosecutor thinking?  Batson is a rule

18 about purposeful discrimination, about intent.

19             And so it doesn't really matter that there

20 might have been a bunch of valid reasons out there, if

21 the  if it was clear that the prosecutor was thinking

22 about race.

23             You agree with that, right?

24             MS. BURTON:  I think if his intent was to

25 strike based on race.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
50 1             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, if his intent was to 2 strike based on race, it doesn't matter that he could 3 have had a different intent that would have supported a 4 good peremptory strike.  And so the question of whether, 5 you know, someone or other might have been properly 6 struck by  by a prosecutor isn't really the question. 7 The question is on the total amount of evidence before 8 us, including all these prosecutors' notes, what was 9 going on with respect to each of these peremptory 10 strikes. 11             And then you have to deal with not just, oh, 12 it could have been this or it could have been that, but 13 you have to deal with all this information that what it 14 really was, was they wanted to get the black people off 15 the jury. 16             MS. BURTON:  And  and I don't think these 17 notes show that.  What the notes show, again, with 18 Ms. Hood  Mr. Hood and Ms. Garrett, they're 19 contemporaneous notes taken at the time of trial as to 20 each of these jurors, are the reasons they struck them. 21 I mean, there's no derogatory comments within those 22 notes. 23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where  where there are, 24 you know, other reasons that are plausible but could be 25 phony, surely it's the  it's the judge that hears the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 testimony who's best able to judge whether asserted

51

2 reasons are phony reasons or not; isn't that right?

3             MS. BURTON:  Yes, Your Honor.  And  and I

4 don't believe that 

5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's sort of hard for us to

6 do it on a cold record.

7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but that's 

8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, it's harder.  It's

9 harder, not impossible, but harder.

10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And Justice Scalia raises,

11 of  of course, a good point in the mine run of cases,

12 but not in a case where all the evidence of intentional

13 discrimination was not before the judge at the time.

14             MS. BURTON:  And  and again, I don't think

15 there's  I don't think there's clear error here on

16 these notes of racial discrimination.  Their strikes are

17 sound as to Mr. Hood.  You would not want Mr. Hood on

18 the jury regardless of his race, based on his reasons.

19 The what  reason that he gives a laundry list, like I

20 said, may well have been because we're in 1987, and

21 you're just putting out everything you can because

22 you're not exactly sure what you're supposed to do.

23             Well 

24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why weren't the notes

25 turned over earlier?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             MS. BURTON:  The  the notes were not

52

2 turned over earlier, although it was brought up in the

3 motion for a new trial in November, right after the

4 trial in 1987.  And the prosecutor, Mr. Lanier, says, I

5 will  said, I will give my notes to the court to look

6 at en banc if defense counsel will do the same.

7             Defense counsel chose not to do so.  That

8 issue was raised on appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court,

9 direct appeal.  The Georgia court  Georgia court found

10 it was work product; it didn't have to be turned over.

11             When we got to State habeas proceedings,

12 they found an open records request under Georgia law.

13 And they were immediately turned over.  I  I don't

14 think there was any argument about it at that point.

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What did they do with

16 the failure to ask Ms. Garrett any questions about the

17 issues that troubled the  troubled, for example, her

18 cousin's arrest.  There's an assumption that she has a

19 relationship with this cousin.  I have cousins who I

20 know have been arrested, but I have no idea where

21 they're in jail.  I hardly  I don't know them.  So 

22 but he didn't ask any questions.  Doesn't that show

23 pretext?  I don't  I'm not going to inquire because

24 she might get off the hook on that.

53 1 times  and I know this Court's precedent on not asking 2 questions is particularly in voir dire as to people. 3 But as to a number of issues, I think when you're in 4 voir dire and you're asking questions, you don't 5 necessarily care what the answer is because with regard 6 to Mr. Hood, if he had said, yes, I have a son that's 7 been arrested, it's not going to bother me a bit that 8 you prosecuted my son. 9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, stealing hubcaps, 10 in my mind, is decidedly different than murdering people 11 or attacking them the way this case was  this case was 12 about.  I  I can imagine a  why can't you imagine a 13 father saying, it was stealing hubcaps  14             MS.

BURTON:  Well, it's a risk the 22 prosecutor didn't have to take.  I  if you have 23 somebody  and, as I said, Mr. Hood could very well 24 have said that, very well have meant that, never have 25 been lying.  But in my mind, I'm thinking, he's going to

54 1 get back there and he's going to think, oh, I don't know 2 about  3             JUSTICE BREYER:  I  I want to ask you a 4 different question before your time is up.  And I'd like 5 you to respond to the question that Justice Alito 6 initially asked. 7             MS. BURTON:  Okay. 8             JUSTICE BREYER:  And that is, is there an 9 independent State ground here?  Now, you're familiar 10 with the record. 11             MS. BURTON:  Yes. 12             JUSTICE BREYER:  And I read on page 192 of 13 the  of your record the decision.  And the first 14 paragraph supports your  the view that you would like 15 to hold, I think, that this is based upon res judicata, 16 which is a State matter. 17             And then there is the paragraph that was 18 read to you on page 195 and 196 where the judge says, 19 "The reason that I reach that conclusion is because the 20 notes and records submitted by Petitioner failed to 21 demonstrate purposeful discrimination on the basis that 22 the race was the basis."  Okay?  That sounds like Batson 23 to me. 24             And then he goes on to say, "And in addition 25 there is no good reason given, now or then."
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             And then he concludes, "Accordingly, the

55

2 court finds the renewed Batson claim is without merit."

3             So if I read just that paragraph, I would

4 think the reason that the judge found in your favor is

5 he decided the Batson claim in your favor.  He didn't

6 have to.  He could have gone on some other ground, but

7 that's the ground he did go on.

8             But at worst, why isn't it ambiguous?  And

9 if it is ambiguous, then why don't we take, you know 

10 I think it's what's in the  Long, you know, all those

11 cases.  If it's ambiguous, then aren't we required to

12 assume that the judge went on the Federal ground?  Okay?

13             Now, that's both Alito's question.  It's

14 what I think is the hardest point for you to overcome.

15 And I want to hear your response.

16             MS. BURTON:  I actually agree that it's

17 unclear.  I think 

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that's the end of it,

19 isn't it?

20             MS. BURTON:  It is  it is the end of it.

21 I think it's unclear.

22             The other  one other issue 

23             JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you think is Georgia

24 res judicata law?

25             MS. BURTON:  I think res judicata in  in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Georgia, if you have new facts or new evidence 

56

2             JUSTICE ALITO:  The res judicata goes out

3 the window.

4             MS. BURTON:  Then you  then the court gets

5 to look at the issue and go beyond.  And I think in this

6 case 

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I didn't

8 hear that.  Then this Court?

9             MS. BURTON:  In  in  in this case, once

10 you have new facts or new evidence, if the Court in this

11 case finds that they can review the evidence anew and a

12 new review is had, then I think you are beyond that bar.

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I  I don't understand

14 what you've just said.  Say it again.

15             MS. BURTON:  Okay.

16             (Laughter.)

17             MS. BURTON:  If you have  if the issue has

18 been decided on direct appeal and you cannot go back to

19 it  a superior court obviously can't overturn the

20 State's highest court.  But when you have new evidence,

21 such as in this case, and it is strong evidence, that

22 the court feels like it has to go  it has to look at

23 that evidence  and in this case it did  then I think

24 you are beyond the res judicata bar.

25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, I mean, I think that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that's exactly how the decision is framed, right?

57

2 Because the decision talks about claims that are not

3 reviewable due to res judicata.  It lists many, many,

4 many claims, and then it lists a whole bunch of claims

5 that are procedurally defaulted.  And then this is in a

6 separate section, the Batson issue, and it's in a

7 section that's with  with all the other claims that

8 there are merits determinations being made about.

9             And the court is very clear, first sentence,

10 last sentence.  First sentence:  "The court finds the

11 prosecution did not violate Batson versus Kentucky."

12             Last sentence:  "On the merits the person,

13 the"  "the"  "the Petitioner loses."

14             So 

15             MS. BURTON:  As much as I would like it 

16             JUSTICE KAGAN:   it is 

17             MS. BURTON:  As much as I would like it to

18 be an adequate and independent State law ground, I'm not

19 sure I clearly have that here 

20             JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you make of the

21 statement on 175, "As a preliminary matter, this court

22 notes that, as cited by the Respondent, the following

23 claims are not reviewable based on the doctrine of

24 res judicata"?  And the first one it lists is the Batson

25 claim.  Does that suggest maybe the court had two

Official
58 1 reasons for what it did?  It's barred by res judicata, 2 and it would fail even if it were not. 3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  But that  4             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I'd like the  I'd 5 like counsel's answer  6             (Laughter.) 7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry. 8             MS. BURTON:  Yes, I think it  if  if 9 anything, it is an alternate ruling. 10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But doesn't Georgia have 11 the rule  Georgia, the supreme court has said, Georgia 12 law allows claims to be revisited on habeas when new 13 facts have developed since the time of the direct appeal 14 because a claim that is based on facts that did not 15 actually exist at the time of the direct appeal, which 16 is this case, is essentially a different claim.  That's 17 what the Georgia Supreme Court said. 18             MS. BURTON:  Yes. 19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  New facts is essentially 20 a different claim. 21             MS. BURTON:  Yes, Your Honor. 22             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You may be right or wrong 23 as a matter of conclusion law, but that's the law of 24 Georgia. 25             MS. BURTON:  That is the law.

59 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 2             MS. BURTON.  Thank you. 3             Mr. Bright, you have two minutes remaining. 4          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BRIGHT 5                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 6             MR. BRIGHT:  Thank you.  Very quickly, let 7 me first say that with regard to what Justice Alito 8 quoted that it's just come to our attention since the 9 trial of the case that Ms. Garrett cousin was arrested. 10 That was on May the 1st.  That was after the death 11 verdict had been returned in this case. 12             Secondly, if you look at the Joint Appendix 13 on page 56 and 57 where they give the reasons for 14 striking Ms. Garrett, there is no mention of her cousin 15 whatsoever in there.  That's the time when she should 16 have been mentioned, after the strikes were made.  And 17 yet there is no mention of that at all. 18             So I don't think there's any way  and then 19 six months later, there is a motion for new trial, and 20 now the prosecution is adding new reasons that it didn't 21 give at the Batson hearing. 22             It's saying she was a social worker.  She 23 wasn't a social worker.  It's saying her cousin was 24 arrested.  They didn't know that at the time they struck 25 the jury.  They said she's low income, taking another

60 1 thing out of United States v. Cartlidge.  But you can't 2 add reasons on into perpetuity.  The reasons are the 3 reasons articulated in  in MillerEl, and the 4 prosecutor has got to stand or fall on the reasons. 5             With regard to the questions, I  I just 6 want to make one quick point on that because there's not 7 much time.  But with regard to Ms. Garrett and Martha 8 Duncan, who were both teachers aides, who were at 9 schools that were literally right in the same 10 neighborhood  Ms. Duncan had kindergarten students; 11 Ms. Garrett was Head Start  no questions:  What kind 12 of children do you have, Ms. Duncan? 13             I mean, Ms. Duncan, if you look at the  14 they also said familiarity with the neighborhood. 15 Ms. Garrett lived, like, 18 or 20 miles away. 16 Ms. Duncan lived 200  her  her school was 250 yards 17 away, and she lived a halfmile from the school. 18             Both of them answered that they weren't 19 familiar with the area where the victim lived.  Now then 20 some more questions after those answers would have 21 provided a difference.  But instead, Ms. Garrett is 22 treated as a liar, and Ms. Duncan is accepted and 23 actually serves as a juror in this case. 24             And there are other examples, with Mr. Hood 25 particularly, with regard to the child.  If you had

He was 2 put on probation  he was  $180 of  can I have just 3 a second?  $180 restitution, and he went off to the  4 this is in the record  went off to the Navy, served 5 his country honorably, got an honorable discharge, and 6 came back.  That  7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 8             The case is submitted. 9             (Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the 10 aboveentitled matter was submitted.) 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
