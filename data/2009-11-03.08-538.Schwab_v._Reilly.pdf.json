    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",
    "speech": "Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The debtor in this case claimed, in the third column of Schedule C, a $10,718 exempt interest in her kitchen equipment. That claim of exemption was fully proper. The trustee did not object to it because it was unobjectionable. The debtor's position here is that because of what she wrote in the fourth column, where she estimated the value of the equipment as the same amount of the exemption, that her claim of exemption itself should be read to say something different from and greater than what it actually says."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. Goldblatt, I thought that what she said -- I'm looking at Schedule C, property claimed as exempt. She lists, as property claimed as exempt, \"See attached list of business equipment.\" And then we have an inventory going for several handwritten pages of all these items of kitchen equipment. And that's what she says is the property claimed as exempt."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",
    "speech": "With respect, Justice Ginsburg, that's incorrect. If you turn to her Schedule C, which is in the joint appendix at pages 57 and 58a, the first column is a description of the property, and the third column contains the value of the claimed enumerates a series of exemptions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",

  {
    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, it may -- that may well be true. She may -- the debtor here may well have believed that the value of the equipment here was equal to the amount of the exemption. But no one contends in any serious way that the trustee is required to object to the debtor's valuation of the equipment. After all --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Mr. -- Mr. Goldblatt, this is -- this is really my concern. It seems what she wants is her cooking equipment, not the money equivalent. And if the trustee had objected, she could have said: Well, if they think that this cooking equipment is worth more than the value that I put down, I'll cut out the coffee maker, I'll cut out the microwave; but what I want is the equipment, not the dollar -- dollars for it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",
    "speech": "Your Honor, the debtor here may well have wanted the equipment. The question here is, did she make a claim on her schedule that the equipment was itself exempt in kind? There are a number of ways that debtors can do that. They can write, \"I claim an exemption in the full amount.\" Here, take -- take a debtor who is saying: Look, all I want is the exemption that Congress gives me. I understand that all I'm entitled to here is a $10,718 interest in my equipment. I think my equipment is worth that. If it turns out that I'm wrong and it's worth more, I don't want any more than the Bankruptcy Code gives me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",

    "speech": "If she wanted to claim the equipment itself as exempt, there were a number of ways that one could do that. She could say: I claim 100 percent interest in the equipment; I claim an in-kind interest. Here it would be odd to read that, because there is no suggestion that has been made by anyone that she has any entitlement to an in-kind exemption in the equipment."

I don't -- I don't want more value than Congress intends me to keep. If it turns out to be worth more, that belongs to my creditors. All I want is what I'm entitled to by statute. That debtor would have no alternative way to express that but to do exactly what this debtor did here. And we think the most plausible way to read it is -- is to read it to have this debtor be expressing an intention that is consistent with law and not one that is improper. There is -- there is no basis under which this debtor is entitled to keep more than a $10,718 interest, and under the ordinary presumption that you presume parties --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",

  },

    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",
    "speech": "Justice Ginsburg, it's only improper if it's read to mean something different from what it says. What she said here in the schedule is: I claim an exempt interest of $10,718 in the equipment, and I believe the equipment is worth that amount. The question is, should that be read to be making an improper claim that the equipment itself is exempt in kind, a claim that would be -- would be clearly improper, or --"

    "speaker": "ALITO",
    "speech": "When I look at that number, I -- and maybe I don't understand this, so maybe you or your adversary can clarify it for me. But when I look at that number, it seems to me there are two ways to interpret it. One is that she is saying: I want the full amount that I'm allowed by law. And the other is: That I want the value of my equipment, and it just so happens to total exactly to the dollar the amount that I'm entitled to by law. Am I correct that those are the two possible readings of that?"

The -- the principal reason is that as a general proposition you wouldn't presume someone to be making a claim for which there would be no legal basis. And in any --"
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",

    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Can you -- can you -- that was -- what you've just said, no requirement that the trustee object to valuation, one of the briefs -- it may have been wrong, but it's the NACBA brief at page 27 -- said \"Challenges to valuation are the most common"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",
    "speech": "That's exactly right. But -- but the point here is that there is no requirement that the -- when a debtor files an individual bankruptcy case, on Schedule B the debtor lists the valuation, their estimated valuation of all of their assets. There is absolutely no requirement in the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, or anywhere else that a trustee go through and say whether they agree or disagree with the debtor's positive valuation. Instead, what a trustee does is they liquidate the asset, they generate the value that is there, and they distribute that value to creditors."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, they don't always liquidate the asset, if they -- if they elect -- if everybody agrees that they get the asset itself, they don't have to sell it."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",

    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",
    "speech": "Well –-"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "On the other hand, I think what you have going for you is that the trustee is going to always be at risk that the asset is worth more than what's listed and is going to have to take steps to value it in every -- every case. In this case, it's -- it's clear that she –- she knew that the Honda was worth more. She was only claiming $2,900, $2,950 on a Honda."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",
    "speech": "That's right, and that was subject to a security interest here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "And -- and if you take that together with -- and -- and the kitchen equipment comes next, and she -- and the value is the same in each column. So that indicates that she was claiming the full value."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",
    "speech": "With -- with respect to the -- the automobile, there's -- there’s a claim of exemption and the rest is subject to a security interest. Here -- I mean, the critical point is if a debtor wants to -- to put to -- to the issue and say, listen, I really want to keep the equipment itself, I don't think there's any value here for the estate, there is a statutory mechanism to address that. Section 554(b) says quite clearly that if -- if a party in interest believes that there is an asset as to which there is inconsequential value, they can seek an order compelling the bankruptcy -- compelling the trustee to abandon that asset to the debtor. So there is -- I mean, Justice Ginsburg's question -- there is a mechanism for addressing the concern that Your Honor has with a debtor who wants a determination that they keep a particular asset, but --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "My concern is keeping it simple, giving fair notice to people. She's got the same amount under exempt -- the last two columns. A rule is proposed. It says when the two columns have the same amount, that's a clue to the trustee that the debtor is claiming all of the -- that particular property. That's a nice, simple rule. It tells the trustee when he has to object, and the end of the matter."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",
    "speech": "With respect, Justice Ginsburg, a -- a simpler rule would be that if a debtor wants to say, I have an in-kind exemption in an asset, the debtor should say that. They should use a term that is understood to mean that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But it's not in kind in the sense that she keeps the asset no matter what."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",
    "speech": "Well, that's exactly what the debtor is contending here. She -- the debtor here is saying that this -- this said even if I'm wrong about the value --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "She is contending that she would like to keep her cooking equipment and she was entitled to notice before it's going to be sold at an auction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",
    "speech": "With respect, Justice Ginsburg, that's not right. Here the debtor was told at the 341 meeting that the trustee intended to sell it. Her claim is that even -- even if he can get more value than she said it was worth, she keeps all of that value, regardless of what it's worth, because -- because her schedule told us unequivocally that she got to keep it regardless of its actual value."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Then -- then her claim is wrong, her claim is objectionable, and the trustee should have made an objection."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",
    "speech": "But the best reading of her schedule is not to make such a claim, but rather to read her schedule to -- to mean what it says, which is that she claimed to have a $10,718 exemption in the property, and insofar as the property is worth more than that, that that's -- that -- that is a question of valuation, which isn't the subject of an obligation to raise an objection. Also, to the point of simplicity, Justice Ginsburg, if I may, the -- the virtue of the rule that we urge here is that -- that it does provide for simplicity. A debtor can clearly put the trustee on notice. The consequence of the debtor's rule would be to require trustees, whenever schedules happen to use the same number, to come in and file pro forma objections. And it doesn't seem that there is any reason as a matter of bankruptcy policy or statutory construction to simply require more paperwork to get to the same result."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Has that happened in the two circuits that apply a rule similar to this, the Sixth and the Third?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",
    "speech": "What I understand, Justice Sotomayor, is that that -- the answer to that is yes and that in the Third Circuit following this decision that trustees are filing those kinds of pro forma objections."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "Why? I mean, you sit down with the creditors, and you look at the list and you try to work things out. That meeting goes on as long as you want. And if it appears there’s an argument about valuation, you file an objection."
  },

    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",

    "speech": "And -- and --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "That's called Schedule C. If you have an objection to the list, then it says: Here's what you do, trustee. Meet with the creditors, try to work it out. And if in fact 30 days thereafter and you don't need any more time, so you don't ask the judge for more time, file an objection."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "What's the problem?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",
    "speech": "It's just different from what the -- what the statute says. What the statute says is that in the absence of an objection, the property claimed as exempt becomes exempt. And if you look at 522(d) and see its description of the property that becomes exempt, that language is clear that it is the debtor's interest up to a dollar amount in an asset. The term \"property\" here is subject to monetary caps. It's not the asset itself. And the statutory language in that regard couldn't be clearer."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "If it's not the asset itself and it's just about money, here I have a piece of property and it wouldn't matter whether it was a case of widgets or my grandmother's diamond ring. But Congress -- this is a peculiar list it has. It has personal jewelry, tools of trade. It sounds like -- even though those have a dollar cap, it sounds like Congress said these are the kinds of things a debtor would want to keep in kind."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",
    "speech": "Well, but those have always been subject -- as this Court explained in Owens v. Owens, those types of -- of -- of assets have always been subject to monetary caps, and the same is true here, and 522(d) makes that clear. Insofar as the debtor would like to keep it, the debtor is entitled to credit-bid at an auction. I see my time has expired."

    "speaker": "WALL",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government is not saying that it's a coincidence that these numbers in the third and fourth columns are the same. It is a common practice. A debtor will often estimate what she believes to be the market value of her property and then divvy up a wild card across items in hope -- hopes of keeping them. The government's and Petitioner's only point is that where a debtor does that, as Respondent did here, she's still claiming the fixed exemption of what she believes to be the market value. Now, I take your concern, Justice Ginsburg, this might be unfair to debtors who wouldn't be tipped off. That is not true here, where the trustee came to the creditors’ meeting and said: I construe your exemption as limited, and I think the property is worth about $7,000 more, and I intend to sell it. And at that point, a debtor who really believed that her schedule claimed full value would, it seems to me, have said: You're misreading my schedule. She didn't do that. She didn't do that until after the 30-day period had run when the trustee moved to sell the property. Now, she --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "What she did do, she said: That unsettles me so much that I'm going to withdraw from this bankruptcy proceeding; beyond anything, I want to keep that -- that property."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALL",
    "speech": "That's right. But she -- but she -- she did walk in. She didn't say: You're misreading my schedule. She said: I don't want you to sell the property if indeed it's worth more than the exemption I've claimed, and so I want to dismiss my bankruptcy. Which she doesn't have a right to do under Chapter 7. She has to show cause under section 707(a). The Bankruptcy Court found that she had not shown cause, and the debtor didn't appeal that determination, which is not before this Court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But the -- but the Bankruptcy Court did that simultaneously with saying: And I'm going to deny the trustee's motion to have an auction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALL",
    "speech": "That's right. And on remand, it would certainly be open to her to attempt to convince the Bankruptcy Court again that she had shown cause under 707 to dismiss. I think the government's point is that there is a process for sale. So even beyond the facts of this case, when the trustee wants to sell property, he has to give 20 days' notice to the debtors and the creditors under section 363 of the code and Rule 2002. So if the trustee here had not even said anything at the creditors’ meeting but had moved to sell, he would have had to give notice to the debtor, who at that point could always amend her schedules under Rule 1009. If she had any exemption left to claim, she could walk in and say: I'm going to amend my schedule, and I'm going to increase my exemption, because I underestimated the property value. The reason she didn't and couldn't do that here is because she had maxed out her wild card. But it's -- indeed, even on remand --"

And I'm going to say which of my kitchen equipment I want to keep with my $10,225, and which I don't. So, it's not that -- there's nothing about Petitioner's approach that denies the debtor the fresh start to which she is entitled under the code. She –- she can always claim right up to the legal limits. What --"

So here's what you do, trustee: Sit down with the creditors. See if there's really an argument. Now, if there's no argument, fine; they'll let you do what you want. If there is an argument and it has to do with that list, C, particularly valuation, which is what these things are all about, then file your objection. That's so simple. And it seems in most places they do it. So why do we want to run around Robin's barn or something to get somewhere we can get to much simpler?"

    "speech": "Well, there are a number of questions there, Justice Breyer. But with all respect, that is not what the statute and the rules say. What the statute and the rules say is if you have an objection to the property claimed as exempt on the list -- and as a historical matter over time, Schedule C has required debtors to put additional information besides their exemptions."
  },

    "speaker": "BREYER",

    "speaker": "WALL",
    "speech": "That's right."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALL",
    "speech": "Well, it says the list of property claimed as exempt. So, for instance, for nearly the first 100 years after they set up the system in 1898, on Schedule C and its predecessors the debtor put down the location and present use of property. But no one thought that the location was part of the claim of exemption, such that if the trustee believed the property was in one place than another, he had to object. The idea was we'll provide some useful information to the trustee beyond the claim of exemption, so that if he wants to file a turnover complaint to get the property into the estate, he knows where it's located. But it just isn't true, as a historical or logical matter, that everything that shows up on Schedule C is part of the claimed exemption."

    "speaker": "KENNEDY",

If they did, then Justice Breyer's suggestion, where they'd sit down and talk about all this stuff, would be -- would be fine. Am I right or wrong in making that empirical assumption? I mean, I just don't know."

    "speaker": "WALL",
    "speech": "I think that's entirely fair. They do have to have a creditors’ meeting, so they do have to -- you know, within 20 to 40 days of the filing of the petition. But I think what will happen on Respondent's approach as a practical matter is the world will look no different; it will just have a lot more litigation. Whenever the numbers in columns 3 and 4 match up, the trustee will file a pro forma objection or extension request. Cases will proceed exactly as they do now. Property can be sold. Some will be returned to the debtor and some will not."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, that's right. I mean, this is a government form, and you say, even though it says \"Value of the claimed exemption\" and \"Current market value,\" that these debtors should know, oh, you should put in, as your friend said, put in an asterisk and write something else in there."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALL",
    "speech": "I don't even think it has to be an asterisk. It's -- debtors commonly will put in on these forms where they want to claim full value, even if they're not entitled to it under the code, full value, 100 percent of value. The debtor in Taylor wrote down \"Unknown.\" Some contingent term that places the trustee on notice that says: Hey, whatever the value of the property is --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "That's much less informative than if she said -- I mean, here she -- she has one list that’s showing what she paid for it. She makes her best guess. It's -- you're suggesting that she would be entitled to the notice if she put down  would write 100 percent -- in the third column, rather than the fourth?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALL",
    "speech": "Well, no. She’d write it in the third column because what she’d be saying is -- the third column is just subjective. It's just what you want to claim, and, under “Value of claimed exemption,” she’d say 100 percent of value. And then, in the fourth column, she would make an estimate as to what she believed that value to be. And, in the event that she underestimated, she could always come in and amend her exemptions. I think it would be odd to read a form where she cited statutory provisions that allow her to claim interest up to a dollar cap and then she had put down definite and fixed numbers to say to the trustee, you should assume, despite the statutory text she is citing and the numbers she is giving you, that she is claiming an unauthorized, in-kind exemption, despite the very statutory provisions on which she's relying as the bases for her exemption."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, now, wait. Why would the trustee object? I mean, he would still be objecting to the valuation. You say that he has no -- no obligation to object to the valuation. But if she writes 100 percent of value in the third column, that's what she's claimed, and then values it at something above the exemption, right? Above the permissible objection, he's still objecting to the valuation, isn't he? No?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "WALL",
    "speech": "Justice Scalia, wherever the debtor lists a contingent term in the third column, whether it's unknown or 100 percent of value, the trustee absolutely has to object. It -- but -- but where the trustee doesn't object is where the debtor does what she did here and lists a fixed sum."

There was nothing more that Ms. Reilly could have done to indicate her intent to exempt the property in full. The bankruptcy court looked at this. The bankruptcy judge sees thousands of these kinds of schedules and made that determination."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
    "speech": "Yes, Justice Kennedy, but consistent with the form and the information the form requests, she completely and accurately provided the information the form requests. And she -- as the bankruptcy court looked at this and said, this is -- she's claiming the property in full. The district court looked at this, the court of appeals looked at this, all to the same conclusion. Now, I think it's important to underscore the purpose of the statute and the rules. They address a very practical problem. We need to know, right away, at the beginning of the case, is this property the debtor gets to keep, or is this property of the estate, which the trustee can sell? We need to know this because, under section 363(b), a trustee cannot sell property if it is not property of the estate. And if the property is claimed as exempt and nobody files an objection, it is exempt under 522(l). The trustee cannot sell it. Now --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "So if it turns out that this business equipment was worth $100,000 and the trustee looks at it and says, oh, she's only claiming -- you know, less than she's entitled, $10,000, and doesn't object, she gets that dramatic windfall."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
    "speech": "Just so I'm clear, Chief Justice Roberts, if she claims that she -- $15,000, but she puts a value of $100,000? Is that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Oh, no, no. She -- she -- and it may be even in good faith or -- or bad faith, depending on the rule we -- we adopt, but she gets that incredible bonus because it turns out her business equipment is worth a lot more than she put down."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
    "speech": "Well, if she undervalues her equipment, for a hundred years, Chief Justice Roberts, that has been grounds for objection. For a hundred years, the practice has been --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "Well, this -- the trustee doesn't know. He doesn't know. He looks at it and says, oh, that sounds like kitchen equipment might be worth that, and so he doesn't object. What you're doing is, I think Justice Kennedy pointed out, you're requiring the trustee to object to everything, lest he lose the $100,000 that it turns out this is worth."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
    "speech": "Not quite, Chief Justice Roberts, and here's why: The trustee gets the form, and then there is the meeting of creditors, and the trustee gets to ask questions before the deadline actually occurs. Here, the trustee went and asked somebody else, do you think this is worth more than she's claiming? And, apparently, somebody said, perhaps it is. Then the trustee could ask the questions of the debtor directly, and if the debtor -- if the trustee needs more time, the trustee can do one of two things: move for an extension of time to object or simply adjourn the meeting of creditors. The timing is completely in the trustee's control. They have plenty of time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ROBERTS",
    "speech": "No, but the point is, that drags out the whole process. You're imposing a burden on the trustee. He loses everything if he doesn't object, and I think the idea is that these things move as quickly as you can, and you don't want the trustees -- you know, I may be severely prejudiced; the creditors might if I don't object, so I'm going to object to everything; we'll sort it out later."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, but that's what the statute does. It poses the burden on the trustee. The rule, Rule 4003, imposes the burden on the trustee to object if the trustee has any grounds for thinking what the debtor has done is improper. Now, these schedules are signed under penalty of perjury. There are criminal sanctions under 18 U.S.C. sections 152 and 157 if the debtor is engaged in fraud. There are penalties under section 727 or 707. The case can be dismissed. The debtor can lose her discharge. This is very serious affair, stating this information. The debtor here very thoughtfully itemized all of the property, she filled out all the information on the form, and she did something else, Chief Justice Roberts. On page 28a of her schedules, she checked a box that's required, and that box that the debtor requires -- is supposed to check basically tells the trustee: This is a no-asset case; there's not any value left over for anybody else after you account for my exemptions. It's very clear from the box she checked off, from the information that she provided, she was claiming the property in full, the very property that she wanted, her tools of trade to engage in her business. Again, thousands of these forms are done. Here, the bankruptcy court looked at this and said she was exempting the property in full. The trustee knows this. The trustee sees thousands of forms. He had the information that he claims forms the basis of his objection well before his deadline passed, yet he allowed the 30-day period to go by without presenting an objection."

    "speech": "No, Justice Scalia, she did not exhaust her exemption availability. She had additional exemption availability left over after she took for her equipment. She detailed, she listed the assets, she listed a value. And under our law, debtors in bankruptcy who own property are considered experts with respect to the valuation of their own property. Shane v. Shane, 891 F.2d at 872, the owner of property is competent to testify as to its value, is competent to testify to it. Here, the trustee offered nothing. There’s nothing in the record to rebut her valuation that she swore under penalty of perjury was accurate. She did -- again, Justice Scalia, she had more exemptions she could have used. And if --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "ALITO",

It’s just -- it is –- your submission is that it is a pure coincidence that her good faith estimation of the current market value of this property just happens to add up, to the dollar, to the amounts that she was entitled to exempt under the specific statutory provisions that she cited in the previous column?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",

They are required to do this under the forms. They are required to inventory their property in Schedule B; they are required in Schedule C to state a value, if in fact they know it. And in good faith --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Now, can you elaborate on this additional -- she -- you said she could have listed something that came to a higher number. Are you talking about the part of the leftover of the wildcard exemption that she -- she used it for food, didn't she?"

    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
    "speech": "She used it for perishable food items. She didn't have to use it for perishable food items."

  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Well, but she was maxed out. Once she used it for that, she was maxed out, but she wanted to have her cake and eat it too. She wanted to get the exemption for the food and she wanted to get the exemption for the -- for the equipment. And so it just so happened that the equipment valuation added up to precisely what was left over after she took the exemption for the -- for the food."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
    "speech": "Actually, the other way around, Justice Scalia. She valued the equipment first. Then she determined she had leftover, leftover exemption ability, and she applied it to additional items."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "But how do you know that from the form? Number one, I think both sides have -- have an argument as to what the form means. I don't think it's at all clear-cut. As I say, I'm looking for some kind of a rule to tilt the case one way or the other. All right? I don't put a lot of credence in the fact that she -- the ambiguities are construed against her. I am concerned that in every case, under your rule, the trustee is at risk unless he makes an objection, and I think that's just going to make bankruptcy proceedings much more protracted and much more complex."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
    "speech": "Actually, I think, Justice Kennedy, the opposite. After Taylor, after this Court's decision in Taylor, trustees understood if they had a valuation objection, if they had concern that the debtor might be getting a windfall, they needed to make an objection."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, but therein -- the problem was triggered when they put in the word \"unknown.\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
    "speech": "That's correct, Justice Kennedy, but that was the appropriate thing to say for that particular asset, an unliquidated lawsuit. When we're talking about tangible property such as cooking equipment, where you can figure out -- you look at the pot and you have an idea of what it's worth, you are required to state that amount. Now, I think, Justice Kennedy, a good rule of decision is -- or a good principle of decision here is that the exemptions are part of the fresh start in bankruptcy, and we construe exceptions to that fresh start against creditors, against the trustee."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "Do you have any sense of how it works in practice? I'm a little worried by Justice Kennedy's question, because the government says in practice what's been happening is that in most places, trustees don't -- they don't object to these kinds of valuations problems, and now suddenly when the rule has changed in some circuit, they do object as a matter of form, which is unnecessary paperwork. The impression I had from reading Collier, and it was -- the opposite was so, that normally when you have the creditors’ meeting, things would appear, what was a problem or what wasn't, and the creditor would then file an -- or the trustee would then file an objection. Well, what is the case? How does the practice work? I'm -- I’m pretty uncertain. I'm not a bankruptcy expert."

    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
    "speech": "Justice Breyer, under the rules, the trustee has the burden of objecting if the trustee has any basis for objection, including valuation, and -- but the trustee has to have a good faith reason for objecting, and how that is determined is the trustee looks at the schedules, asks questions at the meeting of creditors, a section 341 meeting, and then if the trustee has any objection at all, present it. If the trustee doesn't present it, you move on. We have -- finality is very important here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Now, under your rule, the trustee has 30 days to get this good faith basis. Does that mean that he or she has to get a valuation on everything that's listed at full value, that that is really the burden we're talking about? It's not the burden of filing a piece of paper that says I want an a exemption, or even one that says I have an objection. It's what it takes to support that objection and how much effort goes to that activity."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
    "speech": "Yes, Justice Sotomayor, and the trustee has had that burden for about a hundred years. And under the former Bankruptcy Act, they had much shorter deadlines -- 20 days, 15 days."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "No, there's a huge difference between a rule that says you don't have to actually go after this information in a formal way. If someone's claiming only the exempt amount, then I'll go ahead and I'll administer the estate, and over time I'll talk informally to people and get a sense of whether the valuation is right or not, but I won't actually -- actually have to get a formal appraisal because I'll just use my judgment. Your rule would require something else. They would have to get the appraisal to lodge the request for an extension or to lodge the request for an objection."

    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",

You take the car and you check the book value of the car, and the trustee can do a simple, easy, expedient comparison. It's a little more complicated when --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",

  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
    "speech": "No, Justice Kennedy, and here's why: because the statute, for example, points that the court is going to determine in the first instance whether the objection claim is valid, if there is in fact an objection. How do we know this? Because section 522(a) says value is determined as of the date the debtor files for bankruptcy. We do not have sales to determine whether, in fact, the property is what it's worth. We determine whether the -- that the claim of exemption is valid. First, there's a judicial determination of value. It's geared towards the date of the petition date. Why? Because Congress understood that debtors want this property, not just a check from the trustee. It's part and parcel of their fresh start. As this Court explained in Rousey and in Owen, that the fresh start policy embraces the exemption. That is very plain."

    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "I'm very confused because of your answer to Justice Sotomayor. I thought what you were saying -- she said, well, you only have 30 days; you get all this value. That doesn't say very much. You said, well -- you -- you said less. Okay?"

    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
    "speech": "I'm sorry, Justice Breyer."
  },
  {

Now, I would have thought you were going to say but it's 30 days from the creditors’ meeting ending, and that's a movable feast that could last 5 years. You could keep postponing it. You can go to the judge and say, Judge, give me an extension, which he'll do. So there's no problem here. But you didn't say that. So the fact that you didn't say that suggests to me you're not certain about what this practical impact is."

    "speech": "All right. How long do these creditors’ meetings last? How easy are they to postpone? How -- how easy is it for the trustee to get this information together during the creditors’ meeting, et cetera, et cetera? Where do I look to find out the answer to that question?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
    "speech": "Justice Breyer, the practical reality is that there are over a million bankruptcy cases that are filed a year. Most of those are Chapter 13 or Chapter 7 cases, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of them. And that's why the box that's checked on page 28a is a key piece of information for the trustee. When the debtor says, this is basically a no-asset case; after you take account of my exemptions, there's no property left over for unsecured creditors –- the trustee looks at that. And as a practical matter, the trustee makes a judgment -- a judgment call: Hmm. I look at all the things, does it look right? If I feel like I need to ask questions, I will ask them at the meeting of creditors. Which is what happened here. If the trustee then is still suspicious in some way, then the trustee can seek an appraisal, and if the trustee wants to get that appraisal, then the trustee can ask for additional time to do it. If the court thinks that there's perhaps merit to it, the trustee will give -- the court will give the trustee additional time. More --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
    "speech": "Yes. The facts of this case are exactly that, Justice Ginsburg. The trustee here, before the meeting of creditors, went and talked to an auctioneer. In the ordinary situation, it will happen a little bit differently, where the trustee will look at the schedules, and perhaps before the meeting of creditors, the trustee might inquire with someone else, but oftentimes the trustee might ask questions at the meeting of creditors. And then if the trustee wants to, if the trustee thinks it's worth it to get an appraisal, then the trustee will ask for the -- for the additional time to do -- do the appraisal, by either asking the court for an extension or by adjourning the meeting of the creditors. But it's very important at the beginning of the case -- there's a very important finality question here, a finality principle. The debtor needs to know as soon as possible -- and this is why we have an objection deadline. The debtor needs to know as soon as possible: Is this my property? Can I take this cooking equipment and can I use it? Am I the one who is to insure it? Can I conduct my business? Can other creditors lend me money now, now that I'm going through bankruptcy and I have my discharge? Or is this something that the trustee is going to take and sell? That is why we have this objection deadline, to basically say to the trustee, if you have any objections whatsoever about the debtor keeping this property -- whether their value, or the statutory basis under 522(d) is incorrect -- whatever reason it may be, make your objection and we'll have a quick determination by the court. It cannot be true, as the trustee would like it, that the trustee can sell at any particular point in time in the future without having to make an objection, because that --"

And the same thing here, the trustee is saying: I think the debtor is getting too much; it may be worth more. But if the debtor thinks there’s a problem with the valuation -- again, make an objection, because we need to have that finality. Finality was a key concept in --"

    "speech": "Counsel, in -- what's interesting is that all of the circuits or most, the majority, have not announced the fixed rule. The rule they’ve said is: It depends on the circumstances. And so it appears to me that most of the courts are saying to us: We don't want a default rule, because we have to see what has happened and see what has happened between the parties to determine in one situation rather than another what the intent was. It's not an irrational rule. Why shouldn't we be considering that as an alternative? Because once we make an announcement like the one that you're proposing, it is an inducement to undervalue your property, for a debtor, because -- in the hopes that an what about this problem? Are there 105 powers? Are there -- is there authority for the bankruptcy court to basically act, if you have a basically bad-acting debtor? Now the current version of Rule 4003 makes an exception for fraud. If there were bad things that happened, that's been taken care of now under the rule. But we shouldn't assume that and certainly not in this case. Ms. Reilly was perfectly honest and straightforward. She set forth everything that the forms required. The really --"

    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "No. There are comparable circuit court opinions and situations very analogous to this one, where the circuit courts have looked at what the trustee and the debtor have done during the process. And if the debtor has not made it clear that they're seeking the full value of the property, as happened here, there was a conversation that the value was off, the debtor did not tell the trustee that she was claiming the full amount of the property. And there are analogous situations where the circuits have said, no, that doesn't show your intent because you didn't articulate it to the trustee in the informal meetings. That's not an irrational conclusion by those circuits."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",

    "speech": "Yes, but, Justice Sotomayor, it is the filing of the objection that triggers the negotiation, and this is key. This is -- this is really quite key because the practice is that, if the trustee exempts to the -- exempts -- sorry -- objects to the valuation, then there is a court hearing, and the court will resolve the objection if the parties can't negotiate it afterwards. And if you look --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOTOMAYOR",
    "speech": "Most of these cases, the objections are -- the discussions are not at the time of objection. They are at the time of the creditors’ meeting. It is part of the discussion. That's what the courts are looking to. What's happening between the parties? Have they made their intent clear, and what does that intent reflect?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
    "speech": "But if there is no objection, then is no involvement of the court, and the conversation stops. And the reason why you have the objection is because the trustee has the burden of coming forward and demonstrating that the debtor's valuation is wrong. And that's important because when the trustee is now saying, oh, I just need to sell, I don't have to object, the trustee is evading his burden of proof. By just simply saying, I'm authorized to sell, I am going to sell, as long as it is not the debtor who doesn't object. The trustee's proposal inverts the burden of proof. It's now under the trustee's proposal, when the trustee files a motion to sell, the debtor has to come forward and object and now say, wait, I have a valuable exemption here. What -- what the trustee then has done is simply said, I don't have to comply with my burden of proof that's set by the rule and the statute. After all, section 522(l) puts the burden on the trustee, as well, to object. So they are inverting the burden of proof, and Congress and rules have put the burden of proof completely in the opposite way. And, again, we need that -- we need that finality. The trustee would basically have, under his proposal, an ability to file a motion to sell a year later, 2 years later, 4 years later, by reopening a case that's been closed, if the trustee thought that. Our whole point about finality, which was a key principle animating the decision below and also this Court's decision in Taylor, where the Court made the observation that, although these deadlines may yield, in some situations, unwelcome results, they serve very important finality interests. The debtor needs to know, is this my property? Can I use it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But this debtor did know at the creditors’ meeting -- she certainly knew that the trustee was claiming the property was worth more than what she listed it as being worth. She could have, at that point -- so she had the notice of what he was thinking. She could have, at that point, said, I will remove as many items as necessary to bring me safely within the limit. She didn't do that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BRUNSTAD",
    "speech": "That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. Instead she said, this -- the trustee wants to sell all of the property. He's filing -- he filed a motion to sell all of it. The trustee did not give her an opportunity to do that allocation, which she would have had if the trustee had filed an objection. In responding to the objection, she could have said, well, I'm only going to allocate something, because the objection would have been under the exemption rules; whereas, the trustee, when the trustee filed the motion to sell, it was under 363, which is the motion to sell rules, where the debtor would then have had to come forward and object to the motion for some reason, but, again, you don't have that allocation option under section 363. And, again, the trustee puts the cart before the horse. The trustee cannot sell property, unless it is property of the estate, and under section 522, if, in fact, the debtor claims property as exempt, if there is no exemption -- no objection, it is exempt, and, therefore, it's not property of the estate. “Exempt” means exempt from property of the estate. A trustee cannot sell. Congress set up this regime purposefully, to have judicial determinations of exemptions right away, and that, again, is triggered by an objection being filed. That way, we know, at the beginning of the case, does the debtor have the property? Can she use it? Can she continue? Third parties -- can they rely on that? Or is this something the trustee is going to be able to sell? Now, it's important also because the practice, in bankruptcy, as reflected in the Collier forms, is that the bankruptcy court can make a judicial determination. Say, for example, the bankruptcy court here had said: I think there is some merit to the trustee's objection; the property is worth $12,000. The practice, as reflected in the sample form, is for the court then to say to the debtor: Debtor, if you want to keep this property, give the trustee a check for the difference between what you're entitled to claim and what I'm establishing the value to be. That can happen if an objection to the exemption is filed, and we're under section 522 exemptions. That can't happen if we're under section 362 sales. So, again, the trustee's rule eliminates that established practice and that established option in favor of the debtor. Also, the debtor could say -- could reallocate -- the debtor has the right, under the rules, under Rule 1009, to reallocate her -- her exemptions after the trustee has -- she could have sacrificed some other area or something and taken -- taken her additional exemption availability somewhere and applied it. All those options are foreclosed, where the trustee doesn't file an objection and the trustee moves to sell instead. Now -- I see my time has not expired. If there are no further questions?"

  {
    "speaker": "GOLDBLATT",
    "speech": "Thank you. I have two points, one practical and one about what the forms here mean. First, as a practical matter, the task of liquidating and selling the -- the assets of the estates is the work that is done throughout bankruptcy case. Mr. Brunstad's suggestion that, historically, that there was -- the deadline applied to the work of liquidating the estate is simply incorrect. And, in response to Justice Breyer's question, you asked, where do I turn to find out how hard it is to simply extend the deadline? The answer to that question, with respect to the 341 meeting, is page 7-7 of the U.S. Trustees’ Manual, which says, quite clearly, that such extensions should be granted only under exceptional circumstances, and the trustee should not continue the 341 meeting when the debtor appears at that meeting. So that we have a real practical problem of basically undermining Congress's judgment about giving the trustee adequate time to liquidate the assets for the benefit of creditors. With respect to what these schedules mean and whether the debtor was claiming an in-kind exemption, Chief Justice Roberts, you had it right when you said -- you know, when the debtor files what the value of the property is worth is unclear, the debtor doesn't know, when they file, what this will obtain at auction. The debtor is giving an estimate. The question is whether one should read these forms to say, if it turns out that my estimate is wrong, I want that anyway, or if the -- or if you should read these forms to say, if it turns out that my estimate is wrong, all I want is what Congress gave me. And we think that one shouldn't lightly impute to the debtor a claim to be making an improper and unlawful claim to keep the thing itself, when Congress quite clearly gave the debtor a monetary interest. And, finally, with respect to the question of allocation, the debtor can, at any time, Justice Ginsburg, reallocate, including after the motion to sell, their schedules. Rule 1009 says you can amend as a matter of course. So there is still the opportunity to give the debtor exactly what Congress intended."
