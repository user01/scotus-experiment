3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 next in Case 141209, Sturgeon v. Frost.

5             Mr. Findley.

6            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW T. FINDLEY

7                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8             MR. FINDLEY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

9 and may it please the Court:

10             ANILCA was the result of a grand bargain.

11 Congress enacted ANILCA to finally resolve land

12 ownership in Alaska, a process that began with the

13 Statehood Act and continued with the Native Claims

14 Settlement Act, both statutes that granted land to the

15 State and native corporations to further economic

16 development and selfsufficiency for Alaska and its

17 people.

18             ANILCA very carefully balanced conservation

19 with those important goals.

20             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr.  Mr.  Findley, can I

21 ask two quick clarifying questions just so I understand

22 what's at issue here?

23             Your argument applies to the navigable

24 rivers generally; is that right?  In other words, to the

25 navigable rivers running through the federally owned

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
4 1 land as well as to those running through the inholdings? 2             MR. FINDLEY:  If a navigable river is 3 surrounded by the outer boundaries of the park, yes, 4 that's covered by Section 103(c). 5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And is there any information 6 in the record about whether your client actually was 7 running his boat on the portions which were  are 8 within the federally owned parts, or instead it's the 9 inholdings? 10             Is that what you called them? 11             MR. FINDLEY:  That is one word for it. 12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes. 13             MR. FINDLEY:  He was within the shore.  On 14 either side of where his hovercraft was stopped was 15 Federal public land. 16             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Was Federal  17             MR. FINDLEY:  Yes. 18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Was Federal public land? 19             MR. FINDLEY:  Yes, exactly. 20             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  Thank you. 21             MR. FINDLEY:  Oh, sure. 22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just, again, a preliminary 23 question. 24             MR. FINDLEY:  Sure. 25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it conceded by all or
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 is it not that this is navigable  that these are

5

2 navigable waters?

3             MR. FINDLEY:  Yes.  And the Ninth Circuit

4 issued decision in 2001 called Alaska v. United States

5 by Judge Kleinfeld which adjudicated the Nation River

6 navigable.

7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's not contested

8 here?

9             MR. FINDLEY:  No, it is not contested here.

10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you're claiming a

11 right not merely to use the hovercraft in the nonpublic

12 lands.  You're claiming that there's no residual right

13 to control navigable waters in the Federal lands area?

14             MR. FINDLEY:  What Mr. Sturgeon is

15 arguing  we've been very specific about that  is

16 that the Park Service does not have authority to issue

17 its Park Management Regulations to cover State navigable

18 waters that run through these ANILCA parks.

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what do you do about

20 the ANILCA provision that says that boating and other

21 water activities within public lands, within Federal

22 public lands can be regulated?

23             MR. FINDLEY:  Yes.  And those apply to all

24 kinds of waters that are not navigable.  Those apply to

25 Federal waters and those 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
6 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's not what it says. 2 It says any waters in the jurisdiction of the United 3 States. 4             MR. FINDLEY:  It doesn't say navigable 5 waters.  And there is  6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, it could apply to 7 both, is what I'm saying.  What says it excludes 8 navigable waters? 9             MR. FINDLEY:  You turn back to the 10 definition of public lands in the statute, which makes 11 clear for anything to be public lands, the United States 12 must hold title. 13             And there really is no dispute.  The United 14 States does not hold title to the submerged lands or the 15 navigable waters.  So those navigable waters, they 16 aren't public lands. 17             Section 103(c) makes crystal clear they're 18 not part of the park and they are not subject to 19 regulations solely enacted to manage our claim. 20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I wasn't sure, but 21 I  I thought maybe they were suggesting that the 22 navigational servitude and its reserved rights were  23 were title. 24             MR. FINDLEY:  They are not title interests. 25 They are both nonpossessory use rights.  Even the Ninth
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Circuit made crystal clear that the navigationable

7

2 servitude is not something the United States owns.  And

3 the Submerged Lands Act itself disavows an actual title

4 of proprietary interest pursuant to the navigational

5 servitude.  Reserved water rights, it had the same

6 answer:  They're a nonpossessory use right.

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it  it  it may well

8 be, you think, that the Federal government would have

9 authority to do this in the exercise of its navigational

10 servitude even though it doesn't have authority to do

11 it, as you assert, under the Park Service?

12             MR. FINDLEY:  Our objection is to the Park

13 Service asserting its regulation on these navigable

14 waters.  Our position is Congress expressly denied this

15 authority to the Park Service in 103(c).

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  Do  do we have to

17 resolve the further question?  Whether if the Park

18 Service can't do it somebody else can do it?

19             MR. FINDLEY:  You don't have to resolve that

20 further question.  I mean, ANILCA makes crystal clear

21 that Federal government is not bereft of authority over

22 navigable waters.  The EPA has authority, Corps of

23 Engineer has authority.

24             The specific issue here was you  you had

25 pockets of land that were about to be surrounded by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
8 1 these new ANILCA CSUs.  Those included State navigable 2 waters, and that included over 40 percent of the native 3 corporation land selections under the Native Corporation 4 Settlement Act. 5             The concern was whoa, if you're about to 6 surround us with these parks, we don't want to be part 7 of the parks and we don't want to be subject to park 8 regulation.  The idea was if you weren't part of the 9 park, you weren't subject to park regulation the day 10 before ANILCA was enacted, and that status quo carries 11 through after ANILCA was enacted. 12             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose you have a 13 regulation or a statute that's applicable to all United 14 States parks.  Is it applicable here? 15             MR. FINDLEY:  If it's a regulation that the 16 Park Service  17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, let's say  let's say 18 first it's a statute, suppose a Federal statute.  So you 19 need a permit for a fire in a Federal park.  Applicable 20 or  or  or not? 21             MR. FINDLEY:  You have to look at whether 22 this is a regulation that was solely enacted to manage 23 park land.  The hovercraft regulation we have here, it's 24 crystal clear.  That's exactly that type of regulation 25 where the Park Service made a judgment call about what
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
9 1 it believed was appropriate or not appropriate to occur 2 on public land. 3             If the Park Service  this is a Park 4 Service regulation issued under the Organic Act and you 5 read this code of Federal regulations and the Park 6 Service is saying, we want fires here on public lands; 7 we want fires here not on public lands.  That's the type 8 of regulation Section 103(c) is talking about. 9             If the EPA says, look, we're concerned about 10 Clean Air Act emissions from fire smoke and we are going 11 to issue a generally applicable regulation across the 12 United States on when you can burn wood and when you 13 can't, that is not the type of regulation that 14 Section 103(c) reaches. 15             JUSTICE ALITO:  What was the basis for the 16 Ninth Circuit's decision?  Was it limited to navigable 17 waters? 18             MR. FINDLEY:  The Ninth Circuit did not 19 reach the unnavigable waters issues at all. 20             JUSTICE ALITO:  What was the basis for the 21 decision? 22             MR. FINDLEY:  The Ninth Circuit took a very 23 strained, improper reading of the statute and looked at 24 Section 103(c) and said, well, it only applies to 25 Alaskaspecific regulations.  And it was a reading that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1 reads the statute out of context.  It's contrary to the 2 text and leads to an incredibly absurd result that, 3 frankly, no  there's evidence Congress thought this is 4 what was going to happen was that these islands of 5 nonFederal land that were excluded from the parks, 6 under the Ninth Circuit's ruling, they cannot take 7 advantage of all of the rules in Alaska that Congress 8 specifically loosened for Alaska parks.  You can camp in 9 Alaska parks.  You can hunt.  You can fish.  You can use 10 snow machines.  You can fly.  The list goes on and on. 11 Right? 12             Under the Ninth Circuit ruling, those 13 relaxed rules, they don't apply to the nonFederal land. 14 Instead, that nonFederal land is subject to the more 15 restrictive nationwide rules that were not promulgated 16 to be tailored to Alaska.  And that simply makes no 17 sense. 18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Your reading on a 19 practical basis with respect to the navigable waters 20 makes almost no sense to me. 21             I'm looking at a map attached to the 22 petition of the State of Alaska.  It's attached to the 23 end of the brief.  And it seems like these national 24 parks are spread along the coast of Alaska in a 25 haphazard way, meaning the national parks have
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 jurisdiction over a small strip along the coast of

11

2 Alaska.

3             Presumably you're not arguing that this

4 agreement controls the U.S. servitude of navigable

5 waters around those strips.

6             MR. FINDLEY:  We're not claiming that

7 Section 103(c) trumps the navigable  navigational

8 servitude.  What we're claiming is ANILCA makes crystal

9 clear for submerged lands and navigable waters owned by

10 the State, they aren't public lands; they aren't part of

11 the park.

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you're saying that

13 the U.S. can't control the navigable servitude in any

14 part of that coast.

15             MR. FINDLEY:  No.  The United States can.

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can.

17             MR. FINDLEY:  The Park Service hasn't been

18 delegated that authority.  It was expressly denied that

19 authority by Section 103(c).

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so what do you take

21 the words in  in 103(c) to mean, the boating

22 exception, when it says "in the jurisdiction of the

23 United States"?  "Waters in the jurisdiction"?

24             You don't think navigable waters are within

25 the jurisdiction of the United States in Federal lands?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
12 1             MR. FINDLEY:  That's within the regulation 2 that the Park Service promulgated nationwide, saying 3 we're going in  the hovercraft is one of many 4 regulations that they assert to apply within the 5 jurisdiction of the Park Service. 6             Section 103(c), which is the  which is the 7 specific parkenabling statute, denied the Park Service 8 jurisdiction over nonpublic land which includes these 9 navigable waters. 10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if the  as it 11 often does elsewhere, if the Army Corps of Engineers 12 have issues with respect to things that the State is 13 doing on the navigable waters or, you know, other people 14 are building a  a  a damn or a fish  I forget what 15 they are called  the Corps of Engineers can come in 16 and say, you can't do that. 17             MR. FINDLEY:  Exactly.  Under whatever its 18 authorities are.  I mean  and that's exactly what 19 ANILCA was meant to remain unaffected by the law was 20 those generally applicable rights that  21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's  and EPA might  22 might be able to prohibit boating, no? 23             MR. FINDLEY:  Whether the EPA  24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or environmental  25             MR. FINDLEY:   can prohibit boating, that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
13 1 may be an extension of their authority.  But certainly. 2 It's  Coast Guard has authority, EPA, Corps of 3 Engineers.  There's a laundry list of Federal agencies 4 that have plenty of authority here. 5             The question is the Park Service can't throw 6 its hat in the ring and in addition apply its park 7 regulations on top of everything else. 8             JUSTICE BREYER:  But it says in the 9 regulation  look at the regulation.  It says, "The 10 Hovercraft Regulation applies to waters subject to the 11 jurisdiction of the United States."  This is water 12 subject to the jurisdiction.  "Within the boundaries of 13 the National Park Service"  that's the tougher part  14 "including navigable waters."  That doesn't help us. 15             So the question, I would think, would be is 16 this portion of the river within the boundaries of the 17 National Park Service?  Am I right so far? 18             MR. FINDLEY: It is within the outer 19 boundaries of the park.  It is not part of the park 20 pursuant to  21             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, now, you look at what 22 they say about that, and you get, when they're defining 23 the YukonCharley River's National Preserve, it says 24 that that national preserve  which is the whole thing, 25 which includes the section of the river that we're
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1 talking about  contains public lands.  It doesn't say 2 it's identical with the public lands. 3             And then in another place it says, "Only 4 those lands within the portion which are public lands 5 shall be deemed to be included a portion of such unit," 6 not that they make up the whole of such unit. 7             At least we  8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What are  what are you 9 quoting from?  I'm  10             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm quoting from 11 regulations which are 54 U.S.C.  I don't know. 12 I'll  I'll have to show you later, because I'm 13 quoting  14             (Laughter.) 15             JUSTICE BREYER:  We're going to get into 16 numbers, and I  I just thought this case is too 17 complicated to ask anything, but you've tempted me. 18             (Laughter.) 19             JUSTICE BREYER:  And so  so you see  20 have you got in your mind what I just quoted? 21             MR. FINDLEY:  Yes. 22             JUSTICE BREYER:  And then once you have 23 that, you have this regulation applying to this portion 24 of the river. 25             So now we look to the statute to see if
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
15 1 anything there takes away what the regulations seem to 2 give.  And the only part of the statute  though it's 3 an important part  that supports you is the second 4 sentence.  But as I read that second sentence, it says 5 that, "The regulations that apply solely to public lands 6 within such units," you see, "are the ones that don't 7 apply to the private land up in YukonCharley. 8             But I've just read you a regulation, which, 9 on my reading of it, is the Hovercraft Regulation, and 10 does not apply solely to public lands within National 11 Park Service units, either in Alaska or anywhere else. 12 And therefore, the statute doesn't stop it. 13             Now, that's  that's  and I want to  I 14 don't know if I can do this orally; I just tried to, 15 which is to put the argument against you as best I 16 could, and I want to hear the reply. 17             MR. FINDLEY:  Yes, Your Honor.  Thank you. 18 And you know, this is  and the government makes the 19 same argument in its briefing here. 20             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 21             MR. FINDLEY:  And  and this is a dispute 22 that's why  it's what has brought us together here 23 today. 24             JUSTICE BREYER:  Uhhuh. 25             MR. FINDLEY:  But prior to 1996, the Park
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Service did not apply this regulation to navigable

16

2 waters.  That was a change they made in 1996, and that's

3 in 36 C.F.R. 1.2(b) where they say now we're going to

4 apply this to navigable waters without regard to

5 ownership of the submerged lands.  And that is what

6 Mr. Sturgeon is objecting to.

7             The whole point was 103(c) says 

8             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Findley, I mean 

9             MR. FINDLEY:   you can't do that.

10             JUSTICE KAGAN:   whether or not that's

11 true, agencies can change their mind about things.  And

12 I think that the question that Justice Breyer is putting

13 to you is this question about what this provision means:

14 "Shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely

15 to public lands."

16             I mean, "solely" is a very purposive word,

17 you know?  I mean, Congress drops lots of words, but you

18 put "solely" in a sentence when you mean "solely."  And

19 this does not apply solely to public lands.

20             MR. FINDLEY:  Because the regulation never

21 should have been allowed to reach out to the public

22 land.  That is our objection here.  The Hovercraft

23 Regulation, as promulgated in 1983, was a regulation

24 promulgated solely to manage park land.

25             What 103(c) says, it was a permanent barrier

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to take in that regulation and extending it out to

17

2 nonpublic land.  The fact that they did it in 1996, and

3 the fact that they've gotten away with it for over 20

4 years, does not suddenly make the regulation 

5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I  I don't understand

6 why the statute that Justice Breyer is focusing on, that

7 part of the statute.  Applies just to park regulations

8 and not to something from the EPA or the Federal

9 Aeronautics Administration.  Federal Aeronautics

10 Administration says you can't have a smoke stack more

11 than 800 feet high.

12             Why  why doesn't that apply?

13             MR. FINDLEY:  Because that would not be a

14 regulation solely enacted to manage park land.  You ask

15 about the word "solely." The reason that it's there, if

16 you were to take a 

17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it  it  it  but

18 it  it talks about regulations applicable solely to

19 public lands.  But is  is  is that all Forest

20 Service regulations?  Are you saying that that's a 

21 the same as Forest Service regulations?  Is that what

22 you're saying?

23             MR. FINDLEY:  Forest Service regulations are

24 also solely enacted to manage those public lands.

25             To answer your question, if you take the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
18 1 word "solely" out of the statute, you've inadvertently 2 created a statute which says none of these private lands 3 within the ANILCA parks are subject to any regulations 4 applicable to public lands. 5             Now surely, Congress is not trying to exempt 6 these lands from Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act  7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Maybe  8             MR. FINDLEY:  That's what the word "solely" 9 is there to do. 10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess maybe  maybe you 11 can explain that to me.  But it seems to me that if you 12 took it out of the statute, what you would have was to 13 something that says no private lands shall be subject to 14 the regulations applicable to public lands.  And that's 15 what you should want. 16             If  if it had said that, no private lands 17 shall be subject to the regulations applicable to public 18 lands, you wouldn't be here.  You would have won your 19 case already.  But it doesn't say that.  It says, "No 20 private lands shall be subject to the regulations 21 applicable solely"  exclusively, only  "to public 22 lands." 23             MR. FINDLEY:  Right.  And again, though, 24 however, you take out the word "solely," not only, I 25 suppose, will Mr. Sturgeon win, but you have a lot of

19 1 inholding owners that would be happy to know they're 2 not subject to the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, 3 the Voting Rights Act, or anything else.  I mean, that's 4 what that word is there to do.  If there's any doubt 5 about that, then I think the 1979 Senate report makes 6 that  7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you're saying that the 8 word "solely" distinguishes between statutes like the 9 Clean Air Act and park land statutes? 10             MR. FINDLEY:  Yes.  Absolutely.  That's 11 what's there to draw that line in the sand. 12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because I understand why 13 Congress might have wanted to distinguish between, like, 14 the Clean Air Act and park statutes.  But putting the 15 word "solely" in, I got to say, does not do that for me. 16             MR. FINDLEY:  It may not have been the 17 perfect way for Congress to go about and do it, but 18 that's  19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, tell me the imperfect 20 way. 21             MR. FINDLEY:  Well, "solely." 22             (Laughter.) 23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, no.  How does that do 24 that?  No, seriously.  How does that distinguish between 25 two different kinds of generallyapplicable statutes,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
20 1 one generally applicable in applying to park lands and 2 not park lands, and another generally applicable in the 3 sense of applying to both public and private lands 4 within parks. 5             MR. FINDLEY:  Read that sentence in context 6 with both the first sentence of Section 103(c) and the 7 third sentence, and then read it in context with the 8 purpose of the statute. 9             The first sentence says these lands are not 10 part of the park. 11             The second sentence is doing its best to 12 make clear these lands won't be regulated as though they 13 were. 14             And the third sentence makes clear that if 15 the Federal government  or the Park Service, excuse 16 me  wants to regulate these lands, wants them to be 17 part of the park, they have to go out and acquire them. 18 There wouldn't be any purpose for that third sentence if 19 the Federal government  or, excuse me  the Park 20 Service already had authority of those nonpublic lands. 21             And if you take a step back and you look at 22 the overall purpose of the statute  and again 101(d) 23 of the statute makes clear that this is a balancing 24 statute.  This is not just a conservation statute.  So 25 right in context, that's that  what that line "solely"

11              ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUTH BOTSTEIN,

12               AS AMICUS CURIAE FOR ALASKA,

13                 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

14             MS. BOTSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

15 and may it please the Court:

16             This case is about honoring Congress's

17 mandate to protect Alaska's sovereignty in the face of

18 the Park Service's rapidlyexpanding interpretation of

19 its own jurisdiction under ANILCA.

20             Congress provided in ANILCA that Alaska

21 would lose over 100 million acres of land.  But at the

22 same time, Congress provided concrete protection against

23 further encroachments on the lands and waters that

24 Alaska did retain.  This Court should reject the Park

25 Service's attempt to redefine the Federal/State balance

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that Congress chose.

22

2             We know from ANILCA that Congress intended

3 to provide unique management rules for Alaska, and there

4 are good reasons for that.  This was the continuation in

5 a trilogy of legislation that began with the Alaska

6 Statehood Act and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement

7 Act, and this piece of legislation furthered the goals

8 of those predecessors.

9             One purpose of the statute was to provide

10 adequate opportunity for the satisfaction of the

11 economic and social needs of the State of Alaska and its

12 people.  And Congress explicitly balanced that goal with

13 conservation goals and the goals of completing the land

14 selections within the States.  And that means that the

15 National Park Service's authority in other States or in

16 other parks are not the baseline here.  The starting

17 point is the power that Congress gave to the National

18 Park Service and other Land Management agencies in

19 regulating ANILCA parks.

20             And what Congress did in Section 103(c) was

21 to set aside the inholdings of the State, private, and

22 native corporation lands that might be surrounded by the

23 parks, but should not be regulated as though they were

24 in fact part of the parks.

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  By "inholdings," you

Official
23 1 include the submerged lands that were conveyed to the 2 State upon statehood? 3             MS. BOTSTEIN:  We do, Your Honor.  The 4 submerged lands and the waters that accompany them. 5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  Now, is 6 there any basis for distinguishing the submerged lands 7 from the  I don't know what to call it  from the 8 land land that are in the other inholdings or do you 9 understand the government's argument to be that they are 10 treated the same? 11             MS. BOTSTEIN:  I understand the Park 12 Service's argument to be that the  the submerged  13 the waters and the submerged lands have somehow become 14 public lands.  I mean, I understand their argument here 15 to say, well, Section 103(c) doesn't apply to the waters 16 because those are, in fact, not Alaska's waters.  But 17 that is completely wrong, Your Honor. 18             This Court's cases have held that control 19 over lands and waters is an unmistakable and central 20 part of a State sovereignty. 21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What does that do to 22 Federal right to control, whether it's titled or not, 23 all navigable waters? 24             MS. BOTSTEIN:  Congress possesses a right to 25 control the navigational servitude, and that's not an
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 issue here.  Congress hasn't given that and ANILCA

24

2 doesn't delegate the authorization to control navigation

3 to the Park Service as part of Park Service regulation.

4 And I think even the Park Service isn't asserting that

5 it has.  So that right 

6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Repeat what you said.  I

7 didn't quite hear it or understand it.  I'm sorry.  Say

8 it again.

9             MS. BOTSTEIN:  Your Honor, Congress has the

10 power to control navigation in these waters through

11 exercise of the navigational servitude.  Congress hasn't

12 given that power to the National Park Service.  And I

13 don't even believe they are asserting that it has.  So

14 that's not what's at issue here.

15             Neither has  does 

16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, suppose there were a

17 Coast Guard regulation that  applicable to all

18 throughout the United States.  Could that be applied to

19 this river?

20             MS. BOTSTEIN:  Yes, Your Honor.  The Coast

21 Guard has that power 

22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, why is the  so

23 you're  you're just saying that the Park Service lacks

24 authority to promulgate this regulation quite without

25 regard to this statute, which doesn't help me very much.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
25 1             MS. BOTSTEIN:  No, Your Honor.  We're saying 2 this statute, the enabling legislation of the parks, 3 sets the ground rules for what authority the National 4 Park Service has. 5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you're not  I'm 6 sorry.  You're not saying that the Coast Guard couldn't 7 come in and say no hovercrafts around the Alaskan coast. 8             MS. BOTSTEIN:  The Coast Guard could enact 9 regulations to regulate navigation in the water.  The 10 River and Harbors Act gives the Coast Guard that 11 explicit delegation. 12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about if they wanted 13 to say, in this alcove, the Coast Guard, not the Park 14 Service, says you can't have hovercrafts, that would be 15 okay? 16             MS. BOTSTEIN:  Yes, Your Honor.  The Coast 17 Guard could do it.  We're not  18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  If I understand what you're 19 saying, you're saying with respect to a river that's 20 smack in the middle of federally owned lands, okay, a 21 river that's in the middle of federally owned lands, 22 what cannot happen is that the EPA can't come in and say 23 there's some terrible pollution in this river, and we 24 need to address it.  That would be off limits? 25             MS. BOTSTEIN:  No, Your Honor.  What  a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 couple of things there.  I mean, first, the  the

26

2 waters go with the submerged lands.  If the submerged

3 lands pass to the State of Alaska, then there are some

4 lands that are going to be State owned together with the

5 water column itself.  And what Section 103(c) places

6 limits on is the Park Service's ability to regulate that

7 in the same fashion it wants to regulate the rest 

8             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  I mean 

9             MS. BOTSTEIN:  The EPA is separate.

10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  The Coast Guard can do it.

11 The EPA can do.  It's only the Park Service that can't

12 do it?

13             MS. BOTSTEIN:  Or another Land Management

14 agency that is regulating  is attempting to regulate

15 the lands and waters that are not part of the park as

16 though they were part of the park.  We're not saying

17 these are some islands of lawlessness.  We're saying

18 that the Park Service is not the policeman here, because

19 it is Congress that needs to give an agency power to

20 regulate 

21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And I guess part of my

22 question about this is, I look at that map, you know,

23 and that map of this area has all this green land, which

24 green represents real Federal park land, and there's a

25 river that runs through it.  And  and you're saying

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that that river that runs through the park land, and

27

2 nobody can do anything on  or the Feds can't do

3 anything on?  I mean, this isn't the inholdings.  I

4 mean, I can understand the argument with respect to the

5 inholdings and the rivers that are running through the

6 inholdings.  But this is the rivers that are running

7 through the park land.

8             Now, it seems to me a very strange thing

9 that Congress would have created Federal lands in a

10 Federal park land but said that the Federal Park Service

11 can't have anything to do with the rivers.  The rivers

12 are like an important part of the park, aren't they?

13             MS. BOTSTEIN:  The rivers are an important

14 part of the park, but the control over the rivers is

15 Alaska's, is Alaska's by sovereign right.  And the clear

16 statement cases of the Court make clear that Congress

17 does not lightly or vaguely take that power away from a

18 State that 

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's not true as to

20 navigable waters.  The Federal government can regulate

21 navigable waters.

22             MS. BOTSTEIN:  It can, but it has not done

23 so in this case.  ANILCA does not talk about navigable

24 waters.  It does not talk about the Commerce Clause to

25 regulate navigation.  It is about the Land Management

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
28 1 agency's ability to regulate parks.  And our position is 2 that the park  the park management can't encompass 3 State waters and lands. 4             And there are good reasons that Congress 5 made that choice.  Alaska's waters are used in ways that 6 are different from the lower 48 in, for example, the 7 Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, there are three 8 villages of less than one hundred people that are 9 hundreds of miles from any road.  And this is common in 10 Alaska.  So these rivers are the way that you would 11 travel to get medical care or groceries or obtain school 12 books for your children.  And Alaska's ability to make 13 choices about what sort of conduct is permissible on the 14 rivers furthers its ability to provide economic and 15 selfsufficiency for its people, which was one of 16 Congress's primary goals in passing this legislation. 17             The idea that the creation of a park somehow 18 transforms Alaska's waters into Federal waters, Alaska 19 lands into Federal lands without a clear statement would 20 dramatically change Alaska's sovereign ability to 21 control its property in a way that this Court never has 22 sanctioned and should not do so now. 23             JUSTICE BREYER:  As I read it  as I read 24 it, it's complicated, but in a sense it's simple. 25 Yosemite has some private land within it and a lot of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 public.  You know, there's some houses in Yosemite owned 2 by private people.  There are interior regs that apply 3 to all of Yosemite, such as certain fireplace regs. 4 There are some that only apply to the park but not the 5 private people.  What this statute says is the latter. 6 Doesn't deprive  apply to that land that you gave to 7 Alaska.  That's what the statute says. 8             And what the reg says is that our hovercraft 9 reg applies to everything within Yosemite, if this were 10 Yosemite.  This navigable waters, whether the land 11 around it is owned by James Jones, the private person, 12 or whether it's owned  whether it's part of Yosemite 13 Park.  That's what it seemed to say to me. 14             Now, there are two problems with what I just 15 read.  One is the third sentence and the word "unit." 16 And the second problem is the NPS, the National Park 17 Service, is it really all of Yosemite, you know, with 18 that private thing or is it just the public part? 19             Now, that's at least a sorry.  I shouldn't 20 have got into it.  It's too complicated.  Skip the 21 question. 22             (Laughter.) 23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why don't you 24 take  the  the rest of us are interested in your 25 answer to Justice Breyer.

30 1             MS. BOTSTEIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 2 I don't actually think it's all that complicated, Your 3 Honor.  Analytically, the Court would first look to the 4 enabling legislation that creates a specific park.  In 5 the case of Yosemite, there's actually a clear 6 congressional indication that says the Park Service has 7 sole and exclusive jurisdiction over park lands. 8             That's not what we have here.  Here we would 9 look to ANILCA and specifically the limitations in 10 Section 103(c), which tell the Park Service, in fact, 11 you cannot manage State and private lands as though they 12 were public lands. 13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 14             MS.

KOVNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 19 please the Court: 20             When Congress created new park units in 21 Alaska for the express purpose of protecting their 22 waters, their freeflowing rivers and their fish, it 23 didn't simultaneously strip the Park Service of 24 preexisting authorities to achieve those goals by 25 regulating navigable waters.  And I think it might make
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
31 1 sense just to clarify our argument to first explain what 2 those preexisting authorities are and why they let the 3 Park Service  4             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, before you get to 5 that, could we begin with what the Ninth Circuit 6 decided? 7             You're entitled to defend the judgment on 8 any ground that you like, but  that was presented 9 below, but the only issue we have to  we have to reach 10 is the correctness of the Ninth Circuit's decision. 11             Now, I understand what the Ninth Circuit to 12 have held, to be this, that the hovercraft rule is not 13 barred by the second sentence of Section 103(c) of 14 ANILCA, because the hovercraft rule does not apply only 15 in Alaska, because it applies throughout the country. 16             Is that  that's a correct understanding of 17 what they held? 18             MS. KOVNER:  I actually think they were 19 saying two things.  I think you're right that they were 20 saying that hovercraft rule isn't covered by the second 21 sentence.  But I think they say this rule is out for two 22 reasons:  One is that conservationspecific unit, and 23 the other is  and I direct you to 24a and 26a  they 24 talk about whether the regulation is generally 25 applicable or not.  And I take that to mean, essentially
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
32 1 whether it applies only on public lands, in which case 2 it's out, or whether it's the very limited class of 3 rules that the Park Service is allowed to write in the 4 way that Justice Breyer alludes to, to apply to both 5 public and private lands. 6             And so if I could just explain the Park 7 Service's  8             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, no.  I want to  I 9 understand the  the holding  and I  I stand ready 10 to be corrected  to be what I stated:  That the 11 hovercraft rule is not barred because it isn't 12 Alaskaspecific. 13             And, I mean, you filed a 58page brief and, 14 as I read it, you didn't get to the reason that the 15 Ninth Circuit based its decision on until page 49, and 16 you devoted exactly a paragraph to it. 17             And why don't you concede that it's wrong? 18 It's a ridiculous interpretation, is it not? 19             (Laughter.) 20             MS. KOVNER:  We think we have two much 21 stronger arguments than that, and we focused on those. 22 And if I could go to the  23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If it's wrong.  And  24 and  and walk it through, their argument, and tell me 25 why they are wrong.

33 1             I think they start with that Federal lands, 2 as defined under the statute, are only lands that the 3 U.S. has title to. 4             Do you take  do you disagree with that? 5 And if so, why? 6             MS.

So the  in the 19 definition  20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm going  I'm in the 21 definition section. 22             MS. KOVNER:  Yes.  So we're on 3a of our 23 appendix, and it defines public lands to mean lands 24 situated in Alaska, which are Federal lands.  So we're 25 going to look to the Federal lands.  And Federal lands
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 means lands which the title is held by the United

34

2 States.

3             And then "lands" is defined  and this is

4 the critical portion for us.  "Lands" is defined to

5 include not just lands and waters, but also interests

6 therein.

7             And what we get from that, Your Honor, is

8 that public lands includes interests in water that the

9 United States holds title to.

10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, in other

11 words, the interests aren't the title.  This is

12 subsidiary.  It's  it's water that the U.S. holds

13 title to and interests in that water, even though they

14 are not reflected in the title?

15             MS. KOVNER:  We agree the U.S. has to hold

16 title to the interest.  It has to be a property 

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It has to hold title

18 to the interest.

19             MS. KOVNER:  That's right, Your Honor.

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's where I

21 kind of stumbled in your argument, because you're not

22 claiming title to the submerged land.  It's clear that's

23 in the State

KOVNER:  Usufructuary right is a 6 property interest, so it is something you can hold title 7 to.  And one place you see that is in the Mohawk 8 Power  9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but holding title to 10 that is different from holding title to the water. 11             MS. KOVNER:  That's right. 12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you're  you're 13 telling us that the river, that the government holds 14 title to the river.  It doesn't.  It has usufructuary 15 rights in the river. 16             MS. KOVNER:  No.  We're saying, as  as 17 Your Honor articulated it correctly, that the United 18 States holds title to an interest in the water. 19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's different from 20 holding title to the water. 21             MS. KOVNER:  I agree.  And the question is, 22 if we hold title to an interest in the water, how broad 23 is that interest, and what does it let us regulate. 24             And the interest has been defined by 25 regulation.  And  and consistent with the statements
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 of what this land is being reserved for, it's an

36

2 interest that we hold over the entirety of the water.

3 And that permits us to regulate the water.

4             And I think one way you know that 

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's just a 

6 I'm sorry to pause  pause there.

7             I understood with reserve water doctrine is

8 usually, you know, we need water to do this, so we

9 get  we have a reserve right to 40 percent of the

10 water, or the initial flow, or whatever.  I've never

11 thought of it as a basis for general regulatory

12 authority.

13             MS. KOVNER:  So I think that move is made by

14 ANILCA, the statute.  It's ANILCAspecific, because

15 ANILCA says if you hold title to an interest, like a

16 reserved water right interest, then that is a public

17 land, and it can be regulated as public lands.

18             And if  if there's questions 

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm with you so far.

20 That gets you to regulating the waters in Federal 

21 in  in  in Federal units, because the U.S. under

22 ANILCA only controls lands within the conservation units

23 that are public lands.

24             MS. KOVNER:  Yes.

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In the United States.

37 1             MS. KOVNER:  Right.  We only have authority 2 to regulate the lands in which we have reserved water 3 rights, and those are only waters within the park's 4 units. 5             And, Your Honor  6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So  and does the 7 nohovercraft rule apply to the nonpublic lands?  Is 8 that the position you're taking, that you have the right 9 to regulate that as well? 10             MS. KOVNER:  No.  The hovercraft rule only 11 applies on public lands, and so it doesn't apply on 12 inholdings. 13             JUSTICE BREYER:  Then  then  then I'm 14 completely wrong.  Then what the right  then  then I 15 was totally wrong.  I  I thought that the argument was 16 that  just to go to my Yosemite analogy  17             MS. KOVNER:  Yes. 18             JUSTICE BREYER:   that the hovercraft rule 19 was like a rule that applies to all of Yosemite, say a 20 campfire rule that applies even to John Jones's house. 21             MS. KOVNER:  So it's written to apply in two 22 places. 23             JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, it could be the 24 navigable waters.  It wouldn't be John Jones's 25 fireplace.

38 1             But if that  if that's your argument, I 2 was wrong. 3             MS. KOVNER:  No.  Your  Your Honor, it's 4 written to apply in two places.  The first is on 5 Federallyowned lands, and the second is on  on 6 navigable waters. 7             JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought the navigable 8 waters are not.  They're on John Jones's property.  But 9 you still have the authority to regulate them, because 10 the regulation that does it is not a regulation that 11 applies solely to public lands. 12             MS. KOVNER:  That's right.  And Your Honor, 13 so it's like  14             JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that right?  Because you 15 just seemed to say the opposite a minute ago. 16             MS. KOVNER:  No.  So the  the way that the 17 regulations are written as  it's 1.2, and it  it 18 says they apply in two places:  FederallyOwned lands, 19 and also on navigable waters that are within the parks. 20             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, navigable waters that 21 are within the boundaries of the National Park Service. 22             MS. KOVNER:  That's right.  That's right. 23             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's like John Jones's 24 house in Yosemite. 25             MS. KOVNER:  That's right.
Alderson Reporting Company

39 1             JUSTICE BREYER:  The fireplace reg applies 2 to him, even though his is a private house, because it's 3 within the boundary of Yosemite. 4             MS. KOVNER:  Yes. 5             JUSTICE BREYER:  Am I right or not? 6             MS. KOVNER:  Well, I think the  the 7 difficulty is, Your Honor, we think that the navigable 8 waters are not like John Jones's house.  We think 9 they're Federal lands. 10             But if Your Honor is to assume  11             JUSTICE BREYER:  Either way, you say you 12 win.  Either they are Federal lands and this is part of 13 a reg that applies to Federal lands; or they are not 14 Federal lands, in which case this reg applies to both 15 nonfederal and  I mean nonpublic lands and public 16 lands.  So it's not within the second sentence. 17             Is that your argument? 18             MS. KOVNER:  That is right.  And so if we 19 could talk about what that sentence means, even 20 assuming  21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but if that's 22 right, I mean, it  it  it's right because the 23 question is do these things apply solely to public 24 lands.  And you say, well, the second sentence doesn't 25 matter because we say they don't apply solely to public

2             That's not a very significant protection for

3 the inholders.

4             MS. KOVNER:  I  I think it is.  And the

5 reason is that we have very limited authority to

6 regulate things that are inholdings.  And in particular,

7 we are acting here pursuant to an express grant of

8 authority to regulate waters within the parks.  In

9 19 

10             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you  you want to

11 talk about waters, and  and after this question I

12 won't say anything more on this, but is the Ninth

13 Circuit's holding limited to waters?  The  the State

14 of Alaska on page 20 and 21 of their brief cite a notice

15 in the Federal Register by the Park Service in which

16 they defend the regulation of nonfederal oil and gas

17 activities on the basis of Sturgeon, on the ground that

18 Section 103(c) of ANILCA applies only to Alaskaspecific

19 regulations.  And since these are not Alaskaspecific,

20 those  those regulations apply.

21             So they understand it to apply to something

22 more than just navigable waters.

23             MS. KOVNER:  That's right.  So I think the

24 longstanding interpretation for 20 years, so that in a

25 notice and comment regulation of what this provision

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 means, is that it only limits rules that are written

41

2 solely to apply to public lands.

3             And as to what the Park Service can do when

4 it 

5             JUSTICE ALITO:  It's solely to apply to

6 Alaska 

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the whole 

8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   within such unit?

9             MS. KOVNER:  We just 

10             JUSTICE ALITO:  Solely to apply to nonpublic

11 units to lands in Alaska.

12             MS. KOVNER:  That  if that's how Your

13 Honor understands the Ninth Circuit's ruling.

14             The regulation, the 20year regulation I'm

15 alluding to, says if it's a rule that applies to both

16 public and private lands, then it's not covered by this

17 provision.

18             And just to be clear, we have very limited

19 authority to regulate private lands.  So it's not a

20 plenary  this  this provision doesn't grant us the

21 ability to regulate privately held 

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's  let's talk about

23 your authority.  I don't even get to the second

24 sentence.  I just get to the first sentence.  The

25 authority of the Park Service comes from the statute

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
42 1 which authorizes the Secretary of Interior to, quote, 2 "prescribe such regulations necessary or proper for the 3 use and management of system units, including those 4 concerning boating and other activities.  Only here the 5 CSU's are park system units." 6             That's 13.013(c).  As a result, nonFederal 7 holdings unambiguously fall outside the scope of the 8 Secretary's authority because of the first sentence. 9 "Only those lands within the boundaries of any 10 conservation system unit which are public lands as such 11 term is defined in this Act shall be deemed to be 12 included as a portion of such unit." 13             If it's not within the unit, it's not within 14 the basic authority of the Park Service to issue 15 regulations, period. 16             So you  you have to show that  I think 17 the Federal government holds title to the water.  I 18 don't think you can show.  Nobody holds title to the 19 water. 20             MS. KOVNER:  So if I could walk through that 21 authority that Your Honor is discussing and show why it 22 allows us to enact the regulation here.  I agree, Your 23 Honor, that the authority under (a) is general authority 24 to prescribe only those rules that are necessary for the 25 protection of the system units, meaning the parks.  And
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
43 1 I agree that this is outside of that.  And as a result 2 our authority to prescribe rules for this land is very 3 limited. 4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why?  You're  you're 5 conceding that the waters are outside of that? 6             MS. KOVNER:  I'm conceding  well, we 7 haven't  our first argument, Your Honor, is that no, 8 these are public lands.  But if  I think Justice 9 Scalia's premise is what is our authority to regulate if 10 they are not public lands.  Okay? 11             And I want to focus on provision (b), okay, 12 and just the language of provision (b).  It has always 13 been understood to allow us to regulate waters that are 14 within the boundaries of the parks regardless of who 15 owns them.  And who owns them is always going to be the 16 State under Petitioner's theory no matter where we are. 17             And just to focus on the language of it, 18 it's a very specific express grant of authority to 19 regulate waters within parks.  It says we can  the 20 Park Service can enact rules, quote, "concerning boating 21 and other activities, not just on but also relating to 22 waters that are located within"  23             JUSTICE BREYER:  I read that first sentence. 24 It's very interesting, because the tone of voice is the 25 only way I can deal with this case.  Watch.  Imagine we
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 have a valley that's a public land, and that valley

44

2 traverses the boundary of the unit.  Some of it's inside

3 and some of it's outside.

4             Now, only those lands within the boundaries

5 of any conservation system which are public  within

6 the boundaries of any conservation system which are

7 public lands shall be deemed to be included as a portion

8 of the unit.

9             So the only part of that valley that it's a

10 portion of the unit is that part of the valley that's

11 within the boundary of the unit.  The part that's

12 outside the boundary of the unit is not part of the

13 unit.

14             MS. KOVNER:  Yes.  So 

15             JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that what it  I

16 thought it must mean something like that.  If it doesn't

17 mean something like that, it means what Justice Scalia

18 says.  And then they're  Joe Jones' house, the Indian

19 reservation, none of it is part of the unit.  But that

20 can't be what it means, can it?

21             MS. KOVNER:  So I think the 

22             JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you see what I  are

23 you following it?

24             MS. KOVNER:  I think  I think I am

25 following.  The statutes that Congress has enacted draw

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 a distinction between land that is within the boundaries 2 of the unit, which includes private lands, and lands  3             JUSTICE BREYER:  If it makes clear  if it 4 makes clear that private lands like Joe Jones' house are 5 a part of the unit? 6             MS. KOVNER:  I think they're within the 7 boundaries of the unit, not part of the unit. 8             JUSTICE BREYER:  Within the boundaries of 9 it.  Ah, so distinction between being part of the unit 10 and being within the boundaries of the unit. 11             MS. KOVNER:  Just  so this  this grant 12 of authority in (b) has always been  yes. 13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say this grant of 14 authority in (b).  You're quoting from the 15 regulations  16             MS. KOVNER:  No. 17             JUSTICE SCALIA:   right from the statute. 18             MS. KOVNER:  No. 19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What are you quoting from? 20             MS. KOVNER:  From  so on 7a of our 21 appendix, it's a statute.  It's a statute that was 22 enacted in 1976, and it expressly grants the Park 23 Service the authority to enact rules concerning boating 24 and other activities on or relating to waters. 25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you tell me whether
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that statute violates this statute?

46

2             MS. KOVNER:  I think that's  I think it's

3 whether this provision prohibits the Park Service from

4 exercising that authority or whether 

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Go

6 ahead.

7             MS. KOVNER:  Yes.  And so to answer that, I

8 think we look at the text and what does the text do.

9 And the text says you can't apply on lands that were

10 conveyed to the State or to private parties those rules

11 that are applicable solely to public lands within

12 conservation system units.  And so it's not 

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  7a?  You're saying it's on

14 page 7a?

15             MS. KOVNER:  Yes.

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's 54 U.S.C. 107 

17 100751.  It's a regulation.  It's not 

18             MS. KOVNER:  No.  I'm sorry.  It is  it is

19 a statute.  It's the Act of 1976.  I understand that the

20 numbering is  it's an unusually high 

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not the numbering.

22 It's  it says regulations  oh, I see.

23             (Laughter.)

24             MS. KOVNER:  It's about the authority to

25 enact 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
47 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The statute is addressing 2 regulations. 3             MS. KOVNER:  Yes. 4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the subtitle in the 5 statute. 6             MS. KOVNER:  Yes.  And so just  I think 7 Justice Kennedy was making this  this distinction. 8 And I think it's exactly the right distinction.  Is  9 is this authority one that gives the Park Service the 10 ability to regulate lands whether they are public or 11 private? 12             And if you look at the text, it does.  And 13 as a result, this is not a regulation  if you think 14 that waters within the parks are private lands, this is 15 not the kind of regulation that's carved out by the 16 text.  Just giving meaning to the word solely, that has 17 to be correct. 18             And if you also look to other provisions of 19 the statute, it confirms it in two ways, if I could just 20 focuses on two of them. 21             The first is, if you look at the management 22 plan of the statute of ANILCA, it expressly contemplates 23 that the Park Service is going to be able to regulate 24 private lands under some circumstances.  And it does 25 that by saying, you need your management plan to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
48 1 describe the activities that are occurring on private 2 lands and to describe any methods you're going to use  3 the methods you're going to use to control those 4 activities, including, quote, "issuance or enforcement 5 of regulations." 6             And just the other thing I think  7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And if I'm looking at the 8 right section, I mean, I would have thought that that 9 was key to your argument, because it says in these 10 management plans what you need is a  is a "description 11 of privately owned areas which are within such unit." 12 So it's clearly contemplating that there are these 13 private areas that are within the unit. 14             And then as you say, it goes on and says we 15 want in these plans some idea of what regulations are 16 going to be applying on those private lands within the 17 unit. 18             MS. KOVNER:  That's right, Your Honor.  And 19 if I could just focus on the one other part of the 20 statute that confirms that this reading is correct, that 21 the Park Service isn't being stripped of its preexisting 22 authority to regulate rivers.  It's if you look at the 23 other provisions of the statute that very clearly 24 confirm the Park Service is going to have the authority 25 to regulate rivers.  And let me just give two examples
Alderson Reporting Company

1 of those.

Official

49

2             The first is, when Congress is setting aside

3 land for parks  and let me use the park here as an

4 example  it states it's  its purposes.  So it says

5 "We are creating here the YukonCharley Rivers Preserve.

6 And our purposes are to ensure the protection of,"

7 quote, "the entire YukonCharley basin, including the

8 lakes and the streams.  So that provision confirms that

9 Congress is contemplating by setting aside this land as

10 parks, we're going to have this preexisting authority to

11 regulate waters within the parks still in place.

12             And just one other example of these

13 provisions is the Wild and Scenic River Act provisions

14 that are in the statute.  And Congress sets aside as a

15 special type of conservation system unit wild and scenic

16 rivers.  These are entirely composed of rivers.  And

17 says, Park Service, you are supposed to protect those

18 pursuant to your Organic Act authority in these wild and

19 scenic water provisions.

20             The Petitioner's view would 

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What does  you 

22 on page 24, and I think you have mentioned this several

23 times, so  you talk about this isn't a problem because

24 your authority is circumscribed and you have the

25 inholdings are  have substantial protections against

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Park Service regulation.  What  what are those

50

2 protections?

3             MS. KOVNER:  Yes.  So I want to make clear,

4 our authority is very narrow, and we can only regulate

5 where there is some statute that authorizes us to

6 regulate inholdings and 

7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you  do you

8 think the statute that authorizes you to regulate is the

9 one that says "the Secretary shall prescribe such

10 regulations as the Secretary considers necessary or

11 proper"?  Would you 

12             MS. KOVNER:  We're principally relying on

13 the one right below that, (b).

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but do you

15 rely on that one?  Because if you rely on that one, I

16 don't see that it provides any protections at all.

17             MS. KOVNER:  So let me tell you how  how

18 that first one has been interpreted and why it does

19 provide protections.  So that first provision has been

20 interpreted to allow the Secretary to regulate private

21 lands when doing so is necessary for the protection of

22 the system units.

23             And so, for example, if the Park Service

24 regulates some activity on private lands that is going

25 to cause danger or harm to the system units that's 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
51 1 that adjoins them, that's the only circumstance in which 2 authority to regulate  3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So danger  danger 4 or harm, is that what it's limited to?  Or could it be 5 limited to scenic, environmental, noise impacts? 6             MS. KOVNER:  We think it's clear that the 7 Park Service can't simply treat inholdings as though 8 they were public lands.  And the only case in which the 9 Park Service has tried to use its authority to regulate 10 inholdings under that provision is this case where there 11 is going to be some kind of harm to the actual public 12 lands that befalls the park's units.  But  13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But is that true even if 14 it's a  the regulation is nation  applicable 15 nationwide? 16             MS. KOVNER:  We think that nationwide, yes, 17 the Park Service's authority to regulate inholdings is 18 quite limited. 19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So  so if  because if 20 that's true, then I don't know what  then you disagree 21 with the Ninth Circuit on the meaning that it gave  22 gives to the "solely" phrase? 23             MS. KOVNER:  I think that we think  and 24 we've said for 20 years in a regulation that's entitled 25 the Chevron difference that what the "solely" phrase
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 does is it carves out the rules that are applicable

52

2 solely to public lands.  And because our authority is so

3 limited, that's most rules.  It's only under very narrow

4 circumstances that we can write rules that apply to both

5 public and private lands.

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but your

7 authority is not limited if you get Chevron deference.

8 If you get Chevron deference on determining what you

9 think is necessary or proper, the idea that that's a

10 substantial circumscription of your authority doesn't

11 seem to me to be a valid one.

12             MS. KOVNER:  I don't think so.  I mean,

13 there's a  it's been a very longstanding limitation

14 on how this has been construed that we're not going

15 beyond the kinds of regulations I've described to

16 pervasive regulation.  There might be, if we tried to

17 interpret our authority under this section more broadly,

18 there might be a clear statement problem then, but

19 there's certainly no clear statement problem 

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  More broadly?  Interpret

21 necessary or proper  necessary or proper to mean

22 necessary or proper?  You think it's beyond belief that

23 you're going to do that?

24             MS. KOVNER:  I  I do.  And when the

25 history is there to prove it, it's been interpreted

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 quite narrowly, and I think the Court would 

53

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Some might argue that

3 your proposed regulations on oil contravene the intent

4 of this provision.

5             So assuming we do, how do you deal with

6 that?  Assuming some people do.  I don't  I don't know

7 that 

8             MS. KOVNER:  Yes.  I  I think Your Honor

9 is right, that some people might say that that's not an

10 appropriate regulation, and they will be able to

11 challenge it nationwide as not an appropriate exercise

12 of our authority.

13             But what's never been disputed in this case

14 is that, in general, under the 1976 Act, this very

15 specific authorization of the Park Service to regulate

16 waters within units, we have the authority to regulate

17 waters in units 

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  What 

19             JUSTICE ALITO:  What can you do about why

20 this provision that you  you reproduce on 7a gets

21 around the first section of 103(c)?  This  that

22 provision allows regulation of waters within Service

23 units, but the first section, as I read it, says that

24 nonpublic land within the boundaries of  of a CSU is

25 not part of the CSU.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
54 1             MS. KOVNER:  Yes.  So I think the statutory 2 authorization is actually slightly broader.  And just to 3 read the language, it's concerning boating or other 4 activities on or relating to waters located within 5 system units.  And that's always been understood to 6 allow the regulation of all the waters in system units, 7 regardless of their ownership.  And I think it makes 8 sense, because you can't regulate or protect a river 9 piecemeal, stretch by stretch. 10             If Congress  when Congress set aside these 11 rivers and said the Park Service is going to be able to 12 protect the entire river and stream and basin, 13 protecting the rivers and streams and basins that are 14 Federal property is going to require setting a rule for 15 the whole river, and enforcing the rule on the whole  16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  100751 is a general 17 statute; it applies everywhere, right? 18             MS. KOVNER:  Yeah. 19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And  and 3101, 20 Section 103 is specific to Alaska, isn't it? 21             MS. KOVNER:  Yes. 22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't there a general rule 23 that the specific governs the general? 24             MS. KOVNER:  Yes.  And I think then  25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So this general provision
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
55 1 is limited by what Congress has said about Alaska.  And 2 that sentence says, "Only those lines within the 3 boundaries of any CSU which are public lands shall be 4 deemed to be included as a portion of such unit." 5             MS. KOVNER:  Yes. 6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if you read that back 7 into 100751, it seems to me the Park Service doesn't 8 have jurisdiction. 9             MS. KOVNER:  No.  So we agree, Your Honor, 10 that the specific governs the general, and so the Court 11 has to give effect to that first sentence.  And what 12 that first sentence says is they can't be treated  13 they are not part of the unit. 14             So then we look to the Park Service's 15 authorities and we say, does the Park Service's 16 authority depend on this water being part of the unit? 17 And the answer is no.  If you look at (b), it's an 18 authorization to impose rules concerning boating and  19 and other activities on or relating to waters located 20 within. 21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Go  22             JUSTICE BREYER:  The regulation itself says, 23 it says water  "Hovercraft regulation applies to, 24 quote, 'waters subject to the jurisdiction of the 25 United States within the boundaries of the National Park

2             MS. KOVNER:  Yes.

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  And then the National Park

4 Service somewhere has a definition that equates it with

5 the unit.  The National Park Service is defined

6 identically to system units.  That's at 54 U.S.C. 100102

7 and 100501.

8             So if we  Justice Scalia's point is this

9 seems to take the private land, the inholdings, and say

10 they're not part of the unit; only the public lands are

11 part of the unit 

12             MS. KOVNER:  That's 

13             JUSTICE BREYER:   and then the Hovercraft

14 Regulation applies only to the unit.

15             MS. KOVNER:  No, Your Honor.

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's  that  isn't

17 that the point?  Yes.  That's 

18             MS. KOVNER:  No 

19             JUSTICE BREYER:   the point.

20             MS. KOVNER:  No, your Honor.

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the response to

22 that?

23             MS. KOVNER:  So I think Your Honor's

24 suggesting that the regulations themselves say they

25 don't apply

1             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

57

2             MS. KOVNER:    unless it's part of a unit.

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  Exactly.

4             MS. KOVNER:  And I think that's not correct.

5 There's this distinction between what's within the

6 boundaries of the park and what is park lands.  And

7 Your  Your Honor, this is established in Section 103,

8 among other places, where it talks about whether land is

9 within the boundaries of the system unit 

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  Ah.

11             MS. KOVNER:   versus being within the

12 park.

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  So you're saying it applies

14 within  it is within the boundaries of the unit,

15 although the unit consists of just the public land.  Who

16 drafted this?  This is 

17             (Laughter.)

18             MS. KOVNER:  And to be clear, there's never

19 been any  to be clear, there's never been any dispute

20 that the regulations are written to apply to these

21 lands.  The only question in this case is whether

22 Section 103 strips that authority.

23             And Your Honor, I would just ask the Court

24 again 

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the specific would

Alderson Reporting Company

1 overcome the general.  So if Congress passed a new

58

2 statute, it could limit or expand 103 as it chose,

3 correct?

4             MS. KOVNER:  Yes.  And Your Honor, just 

5 if I could leave the Court with  I mean, in

6 interpreting Section 103, this provision that talks

7 about rules solely applicable to public lands, and

8 whether that removes the Park Service's preexisting

9 authority to regulate waters in the parks, I would just

10 ask the Court to look to all the other provisions of the

11 statute that clearly contemplate  of ANILCA, the

12 statute  that clearly contemplate the Park Service is

13 going to retain the authority to protect park's waters.

14             JUSTICE ALITO:  Let's say that part of a

15 river is within a CSU.  And do you read this statute to

16 mean that the the Park Service could regulate boating

17 500 miles downstream from that part of the  on that

18 river, because it's relating to waters that are within

19 the CSU?

20             MS. KOVNER:  The Park Service has  has

21 consistently understood its authority to be regulating

22 the park's  within the park's boundaries.  It's never

23 sought to enact a regulation outside of the park's

24 boundaries.  But this 1976 provision has uniformly been

25 understood to confer on the Park Service

59 1             JUSTICE BREYER:  Are you satisfied with this 2 holding  imaginary  but the Ninth Circuit's wrong. 3             Two, the second sentence does not bar this 4 regulation. 5             Three, there are other possible arguments; 6 we send it back for reconsideration as to whether those 7 arguments are good or bad. 8             MS. KOVNER:  I'm  I'm not sure I 9 understand the second sentence of the whole  so  10             JUSTICE BREYER:  They  they  we're 11 saying that the second sentence, which is what they're 12 talking about primarily in the briefs, the second 13 sentence of (c)  14             MS. KOVNER:  Yes. 15             JUSTICE BREYER:   "no lands which," 16 et cetera, you're right about that. 17             MS.

KOVNER:  Yes. 21             JUSTICE BREYER:  Then as to this first 22 sentence, which I  I don't think I focused on, 23 particularly, we say go back and argue that. 24             MS. KOVNER:  Your Honor, this case could be 25 sent back to address both that and to address the

60 1 question of what is public lands, which is a question 2 that wasn't addressed below.  And we think it would be 3 sufficient to say the second sentence doesn't  the 4 text clearly indicates the second sentence doesn't 5 prohibit the application of those rules that are validly 6 written to apply to both public and private lands within 7 the parks. 8             This regulation is a rule that's been 9 written to apply, regardless of who owns the lands in 10 the parks.  It's an exercise of our narrow authority  11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  That's you winning. 12             (Laughter.) 13             I think Justice Alito has been asking you 14 this question from the beginning. 15             MS. KOVNER:  Yes. 16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do you think the 17 Ninth Circuit meant?  And do you agree with its 18 interpretation?  As he pointed out  19             MS. KOVNER:  Yes. 20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   you spent 49 pages of 21 your brief arguing other things  22             MS.

61 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So what do 2 you think it held? 3             MS. KOVNER:  So we think there are  we 4 have two stronger arguments, but we think part of what 5 the Ninth Circuit said was the second sentence only 6 limits rules that are specific to conservation system 7 units.  And "conservation system units" is defined in 8 the statute to be parks units in Alaska. 9             And we think, yes, the plain text of this 10 regulation only limits those kinds of rules.  We don't 11 think the Court needs to reach that  12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think the Ninth 13 Circuit was right? 14             MS. KOVNER:  Yes. 15             JUSTICE ALITO:  So if there's a rule that 16 applies to conservation  it applies to Alaska, and it 17 applies to the National Mall, that would be that you 18 can't have a Hovercraft in Alaska or in the tidal basin. 19 Under the Ninth Circuit's  the Ninth Circuit's 20 rationale, that would be 107  103  103(c) wouldn't 21 buy that. 22             MS. KOVNER:  I don't think there's any 23 dispute that's what the plain text says.  And the reason 24 I don't think that's ridiculous or irrational, 25 Your Honor, is because when ANILCA was enacted, there
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
62 1 was a very wellsettled regulatory regime that didn't 2 subject private lands to any kind of plenary authority. 3 So Congress had every reason to  may I just finish my 4 sentence? 5             Congress had every reason to expect that 6 would remain the rule, nationwide.  And what it was 7 concerned about was that the Park Service would deviate 8 from that approach in Alaska when these new lands were 9 added. 10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 11             Mr. Findley, you have two minutes remaining. 12          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW T.

FINDLEY:  Yes.  And that's  it's 18 simply backwards to what 103(c) was supposed to do. 19             Let's take Joe Jones' house, and let's think 20 about it differently.  Let's think about this as a 21 native corporation's land allotment. 22             You have 40 percent of their land allotment 23 that they were given under Native Claim Settlement Act, 24 land that was given to them in exchange for 25 extinguishing their entire claim for aboriginal land

2             It's about to be surrounded by these ANILCA

3 parks.  It's worth taking a step back.  What does 1 

4 Section 103(c) doing?  It is saying before ANILCA was

5 passed, you're not part of the park and you're not

6 subject to Park Service regulation.  The day after

7 ANILCA was part  excuse me.  The day after ANILCA is

8 passed, you're still not part of the park and you're

9 still not subject to Park Service regulation.

10             The government's position here, they keep

11 saying their authority is limited, and Mr. Chief Justice

12 hit the nail on the head.  They're relying on the

13 Organic Act which allows them to enact any regulations

14 they feel necessary at any time.

15             They've already done that with the 9(b) oil

16 and gas regulations, seeking to apply those to

17 nonFederal land within Alaska.  And the hits are going

18 to keep on coming unless this Court stops this

19 interpretation and goes back to what 103(c) was meant to

20 do, which was to prevent the Park Service from taking

21 these lands that aren't owned by the government and

22 regulating them as though they are part of the park.

23             And the second point want  I  I want to

24 make  I imagine about 45 seconds at this point:

25 There's a lot of discussion about whether ANILCA covers

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 navigable waters or not.  The clear statement rule

64

2 covers that question.  And in that circumstance, it's a

3 question of is anything in the statute clearly saying we

4 are taking away State authority over navigable waters?

5             You will not find the term navigable waters

6 in the statute once.

7             Let's contrast this to other parkenabling

8 legislation.  This is for Olympic National Park, and

9 you'll find this at 16 U.S.C. 251(n).  And here's what

10 it says:  "The boundary of Olympic National Park

11 Washington is"  if I may just finish the quote  "is

12 hereby revised to"  "is hereby revised to include

13 within the park all submerged lands and waters of Lake

14 Ozette, Washington, and the Ozette River, Washington."

15             There's your clear statement.

16             Thank you.

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

18             Case is submitted.
