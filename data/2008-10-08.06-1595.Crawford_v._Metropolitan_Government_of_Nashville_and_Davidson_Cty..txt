1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (12:59 p.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in Case 06-1595, Crawford v. The Metropolitan 5 Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee. 6 Mr. Schnapper. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 10 it please the Court: 11 When Vicky Crawford reported to city 12 officials that she had been repeatedly harassed by the 13 board's director of employee relations, her conduct was 14 protected by section 704(a) of Title VII. It is 15 protected first by the first clause of section 704(a), 16 which is known as the opposition clause. The opposition 17 clause has three elements that must be proven. Only one 18 of them is at issue here. But just to set the context, 19 first a plaintiff will have to prove that the employer 20 acted with a retaliatory motive. Second, the employee's 21 statement or conduct must relate to action that was 22 unlawful under Title VII. It might be something that 23 happened in the past. It might be a concern about 24 something that might happen in the future. 25 And third, the conduct must be in the nature

1 of opposition, and that's the question in dispute in 2 this particular case. 3 It is our view that the -- it is sufficient 4 to establish that element if a reasonable person would 5 conclude from the employee's statement or conduct that 6 the employee disapproved of or objected to the 7 employment practice in question. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: So a co-worker of your 9 client says: You know, the boss really was guilty of 10 sexual harassment and the co-worker says: Gee, that's 11 terrible. 12 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, yes. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's enough? That's 14 opposition? 15 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Yes, it is. In fact, 16 there are cases involving -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it's just, 18 sexual harassment is terrible? 19 MR. SCHNAPPER: That would be covered. If 20 an employee wore a button -21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if there's no 22 link, there's no link to the person that the original -23 the complainant says was engaged in that activity? 24 MR. SCHNAPPER: The opposition doesn't have 25 to be directed at a particular event.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about, violating the 2 law is terrible? 3 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think if there's no 4 reference to Title VII that wouldn't suffice. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. But if she said that 6 in response to the remark by the co-worker that she had 7 been subjected to sexual harassment and then the remark 8 was "Violating the law is terrible," that's opposition? 9 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think a trier of fact 10 could conclude she was referring to what the co-worker 11 had just said. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if Mr. Jones, the 13 person, did that, that's terrible. 14 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's actionable as 16 opposition to the practices? 17 MR. SCHNAPPER: It is protected. If the 18 employer comes in and fires her for having said that. 19 The case -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to say in part 22 it seems to me that in isolation it seems harmless, 23 almost trivial, but the whole point is that the employer 24 doesn't think it is trivial. The employer uses it, by 25 hypothesis, as a basis to retaliate.

1 MR. SCHNAPPER: Right. That's why the 2 elements are important. If the employer fires a worker 3 for that -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that doesn't solve the 5 problem of having too broad an entry into this thing. 6 You get to the jury by just showing that she said "Oh, 7 if he did that, it's terrible," and then it's up to the 8 jury all of a sudden whether that is the reason that the 9 employer fired this person or not. I mean, that just 10 leaves -- lays the employer open to a lot of jury 11 determinations that he shouldn't be subject to, it seems 12 to me. 13 MR. SCHNAPPER: With all deference, Your 14 Honor, the plaintiff must have sufficient evidence to 15 get to the jury on all three elements. Retaliation 16 claims are routinely dismissed on the causation element. 17 There's not usually a dispute about whether the conduct 18 was protected, and this case in that regard is unusual. 19 But the -20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you believe, as I 21 understood you to suggest a moment ago, that you could 22 prove causation if the statement "It is terrible" or 23 "Sexual harassment is terrible" had been uttered in 24 effect in the abstract without reference to particular 25 behavior or a charge of particular behavior on the part

1 of a co-worker or an employer? In other words, if A 2 says "Sexual harassment is terrible" and elsewhere in 3 the company sexual harassment is going on and A is then 4 fired, would it be your view that A would at least state 5 a claim if A said, I had expressed disapproval of sexual 6 harassment, it turns out there was sexual harassment 7 being gone -- taking place elsewhere; and I was fired 8 for that reason. Would that at least state a claim that 9 would get a harassment case into court? 10 MR. SCHNAPPER: Up -11 JUSTICE SOUTER: What I'm getting at, 12 doesn't the statement "It's terrible" or whatever the 13 opposition may be have to be made in relation to some 14 specific activity? 15 MR. SCHNAPPER: No, Your Honor. No, Your 16 Honor. 17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then what is the limit? It 18 seems to me you've got a cause of action in effect under 19 the statute that would be virtually unlimited. Anybody 20 who thinks sexual harassment is bad and later gets fired 21 can claim retaliation under the statute if it turns out 22 just as a matter of good luck that somebody was being 23 sexually harassed unbeknownst to the speaker. 24 MR. SCHNAPPER: That's at least two 25 questions. Let me try to answer them both. With regard
7

1 to what would constitute protected activity, it is our 2 view -- and I think this is consistent with the lower 3 courts and the view of the government -- that there 4 doesn't have to actually be a violation. If a worker 5 walks into the office with a button saying "Violations 6 of Title VII are bad and I'm against them," she can 7 be -- and fired for that, that's illegal even though 8 nothing was going wrong. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why are we -- why are 10 we spending so much time on hypotheticals that are so 11 far from this case? This was a person who appeared at 12 an internal proceeding, she gave testimony, very 13 specific testimony. She wasn't saying: I'm against 14 harassment. She said: This boss harassed me. It is 15 about as specific as you get. So we're dealing with a 16 particular case of somebody who was a witness in an 17 internal investigation. Why do we have to reach the 18 outer boundaries of this claim in this case? 19 MR. SCHNAPPER: You do not, Your Honor. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, you know, 21 that's why we ask hypotheticals that aren't related to 22 the specific facts, because we're interested in how 23 broadly the proposition you're asking for goes. I'd 24 still like to find out where you draw the limit. What 25 if the person says: Mr. Jones would never do anything

1 like that, but if he did that would be terrible. Now, 2 is that actionable as opposition? 3 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Expressing 4 disagreement with conduct that violates the law is what 5 the opposition clause protects. It doesn't have to be 6 about a specific instance, although it emphatically is 7 so here. It doesn't have to reference the statute. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: And there does not have to 9 have been sexual harassment in the employment unit. 10 MR. SCHNAPPER: That's right. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: So this is a law directed 12 against expressive activity. 13 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Yes. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are those laws good? I 15 thought we had a First Amendment. 16 MR. SCHNAPPER: No, no. It is a law that 17 protect expressive activity and those laws are 18 excellent. It protects the activity. 19 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the employee just 20 made -- reports factual information: Supervisor did 21 such and such; doesn't express opposition to it. Or 22 what if the employee goes further and says: Supervisor 23 did such and such, but I know he was just kidding; or I 24 hope you don't take any action against that person. 25 Would that be opposition?

1 MR. SCHNAPPER: Not necessarily. Again, it 2 depends on the question that was asked and the answer 3 that was given. If I might, for example, in this case 4 the question was did Mr. Hughes engage in inappropriate 5 activity. That was a request -- I think a trier of fact 6 could understand that that was a request for a 7 description of something that the witness objected to. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: Let me ask this. Suppose 9 the employer conducts an investigation because it 10 believes that the supervisor has engaged in improper 11 activity. So what they are trying to do is substantiate 12 grounds for dismissal or some other sanction. And then 13 an employee provides information that's exculpatory. 14 Can -- is that protected? Is that -- is that 15 information protected. 16 MR. SCHNAPPER: It's our view that that is 17 not protected by the opposition clause. It is our view 18 it would be protected by the participation clause. 19 If I might get back to the question -20 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it strange when there 21 are many situations in which testimony or the reporting 22 of information is protected, but when it's done, isn't 23 it usually done both ways, as it is under the 24 participation clause? So that the testimony is -25 cannot be the subject of retaliation or the reporting of
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 information cannot be the subject of retaliation, but 2 not it's protected only if it goes in one direction? 3 Isn't that a very odd approach to that situation? 4 MR. SCHNAPPER: That's why we're advancing 5 the view that the participation clause here provides as 6 well, so that it's clear that exculpatory witnesses are 7 protected. It is not unimaginable that an exculpatory 8 witness would anger someone. 9 But going back to the question you asked 10 earlier, it's possible that in response to a question an 11 answer might be given which a reasonable person would 12 not conclude reflected disapproval such as, well, he 13 told that joke, and I thought it was funny. 14 And, indeed, in the Harris v. Forklift case 15 there were witnesses like that who -- who confirmed that 16 the owner of Harris Forklift had made the jokes in 17 question but said they didn't mind. That that would not 18 be our position at -19 JUSTICE ALITO: Wouldn't that be very 20 strange? Suppose that this -- the factual situation 21 actually is very severe and is enough to -- to establish 22 liability on the employer's part, but this particular 23 reporting employee doesn't think so. So then the 24 employer might well be very annoyed that this 25 information which can be the -- the basis for liability
11

1 has been brought out against the employer, and the 2 employer might want to retaliate. 3 Why would that be unprotected just because 4 this employee adds his or her opinion that it isn't 5 serious? 6 MR. SCHNAPPER: We think it is protected by 7 the participation clause. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Why don't you follow what 9 the EEOC says? I mean, the EEOC, as I understand it, 10 has said the very fact the employer has initiated an 11 investigation of an alleged discrimination is sufficient 12 to demonstrate the reasonableness of the employee's 13 belief that by providing information relevant to the 14 inquiry she is opposing an employment practice made 15 unlawful by Title VII. 16 And then they go on. To be absolutely clear 17 about it, they say an employee who assists her or her 18 employer in the endeavor, i.e., you go and testify; so 19 the sun was shining on that day; you are assisting your 20 employee by telling the truth-- is by definition -- is 21 opposing practices made unlawful by Title VII. 22 So here we have a difficult question, quite 23 an interstitial question, defining precisely "opposing," 24 and here we have the EEOC doing it. So why don't we 25 just follow what they say?

1 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I -- that would -2 that would certainly be fine with us. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't be fine with 4 me. 5 MR. SCHNAPPER: We get to the same place -6 we get to the same place by a different route. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if I am 8 indeed very much in favor of sexual harassment? I am a 9 world class sexual harasser, but I'm also not a liar, 10 and I'm -- I am subpoenaed or called up by the employer 11 in connection with this internal investigation and asked 12 whether so-and-so harassed a particular worker. And I'd 13 say, yes, as a matter of fact, he did, and a good thing 14 too. 15 Is that expressing opposition? 16 MR. SCHNAPPER: No. We believe it is 17 covered by the participation clause. We think -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Covered by the 19 participation clause? 20 MR. SCHNAPPER: Because our view is that the 21 employer's internal processes for detecting and rooting 22 out sexual harassment, for example, is a -- is a process 23 -- is a process that's under this title within the 24 meaning of -25 JUSTICE BREYER: Is this a real problem?

1 mean, let's suppose the opposition clause protects 2 everybody in the internal investigation who could be at 3 all interpreted as favorable to the complainant. It 4 also protects everybody who could possibly be viewed as 5 neutral. 6 Then you have a problem about what about a 7 person who loves sexual harassment? This is the 8 hypothetical: he comes in, testifies: I love sexual 9 harassment; it's wonderful, and they fire him. Now is 10 this a real problem? 11 MR. SCHNAPPER: It -- it is not, Your Honor. 12 But -- but as the -- as the Chief Justice pointed out, 13 I'm -- you know, I'm here to answer hypothetical 14 questions, and I'm going to do so. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that -16 [Laughter.] 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that the -18 real case -- the real case that we're dealing with is 19 somebody who appeared in an internal investigation, and 20 I thought that what was the debate between the two 21 sides; anyone who made a charge, testified, assisted, or 22 participated in any manner in the investigation, I 23 thought that the other side's position was, well, this 24 is not an "investigation" within the meaning of the 25 statute. That what goes on internally doesn't qualify.

1 "Investigation," "proceeding," or "hearing" 2 under Title VII requires first that there be a Title VII 3 charge. I thought that that's what the controversy 4 we're talking about today is about: Is this a 5 qualifying investigation? 6 MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, there actually 7 are two distinct questions here. One of them is whether 8 the conduct is protected by the opposition clause and 9 whether it constitutes opposition. 10 The second question is whether this conduct 11 is protected by the participation clause and would be an 12 investigation under Title VII. We are asserting 13 arguments under both claims, and -- and the Respondents 14 disagree with us on both. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And those are 16 overlapping but not whatever it -- concurring -17 MR. SCHNAPPER: Redundant. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- positions. You 19 can oppose without participating. You can participate 20 without opposing. 21 MR. SCHNAPPER: Right. Right. This case is 22 both. But -- but there are circumstances which are only 23 one or the other. 24 And this is -- this is a statute that -25 that is deliberately written with overlapping provisions

1 to be sure nothing is missed. 2 In the phrase in the Fort Stewart case, I 3 think, Justice Scalia, it is ex abundante cotilla, out 4 of an abundance of caution, or in modern terms boots -5 belt and suspenders. So these are deliberately 6 overlapping provisions to -- to assure that -7 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the test for 8 determining whether an investigation has been done, and 9 the person has testified? What degree of formality, if 10 anything, is necessary? 11 If -- if somebody in -- in the company 12 simply goes to the office of an employee or the 13 workplace of an employee or encounters the employee in 14 the hallway or someplace and asks a question, is that 15 enough? Does it have to be -16 MR. SCHNAPPER: No. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: -- a sort of a formal 18 proceeding in -- in some sense? 19 MR. SCHNAPPER: It -- it -- in our view, it 20 doesn't have to be formal, but there are two essential 21 elements to an investigation or a proceeding or anything 22 other internal being under this title. The first is 23 that the employer must have a rule or policy forbidding 24 the type of discrimination in question which is similar 25 to the requirements in section 706(c) for State and
16
Alderson Reporting Company

1 local agencies. 2 Second, the individual -- the official who 3 did whatever you describe has to have been specifically 4 authorized by the employer to play that role. Vicarious 5 here wouldn't cover it. 6 If I could reserve the balance. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 8 Ms. Blatt. 9 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT 10 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 11 AS AMICUS CURIAE, 12 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 13 MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 14 and may it please the Court. 15 We think this case is best resolved under 16 the opposition clause, and that clause does not require 17 employees to utter magic words of opposition or to 18 initiate the interview in which they express opposition 19 to unlawful conduct. Rather, the clause is satisfied 20 when a reasonable person would understand that the 21 employee has objected to sexual harassment in the 22 workplace. 23 And when an employee discloses or reports 24 that she has been subject to unlawful sexual harassment, 25 a reasonable person could certainly infer that the
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 employee opposes a practice made unlawful by the 2 statute. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In that case, 4 doesn't the opposing employee herself have a direct 5 cause of action under Title VII? Given what 6 Ms. Crawford described, you know, "that happened to me, 7 too," she could proceed under Title VII herself. 8 MS. BLATT: Right. She has got timing 9 requirements. So if she hasn't complained to the EEOC 10 within the relevant time, she wouldn't have a cause of 11 action for discrimination. But once she has 12 retaliated -- an adverse action is taken against her 13 because of what she has reported, then she has timing 14 requirements on when she has to sue for the retaliation, 15 and she did that here. 16 And this is a case where the Sixth Circuit 17 tossed the case out on summary judgment, and it erred in 18 doing so because the facts alleged in this case were 19 more than ample to survive summary judgment on the 20 question of whether she opposed what the Director of 21 Employee Relations did to her. 22 She alleged that in the context of a sexual 23 harassment investigation in which she was asked to 24 disclose inappropriate behavior by the director, she 25 reported repeated instances of offensive, objectionable,
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and unwelcome conduct by him. For instance, she said 2 that she had her head pulled into his lap and that in 3 response she threw him out of the office, thereby 4 indicating that she did not like this conduct. 5 The jury could easily infer from those facts 6 that she opposed the director's conduct. Now, that 7 timing would -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would you go as far 9 as Mr. Schnapper in determining what constitutes 10 "opposition"? I mean, do you agree with him that a case 11 where somebody says, "oh, Mr. Jones would never do that, 12 and if he did, I think that would be awful" -- is that 13 "opposition"? 14 MS. BLATT: If you -- yes, if a reasonable 15 person could infer that. I think that we are similar. 16 But if you just are a reporter of unlawful 17 conduct, that's enough. But this case is easier, much 18 easier. She was a victim. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, yes, I know, 20 but -- I know, but -21 MS. BLATT: I understand that. And if -22 you can either decide the broader question or the 23 question of the Petitioner here, which she reported that 24 she was subject, and it makes it all the more evident, 25 and certainly a jury could have found that she opposed
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the conduct. 2 But we do think that at least a reasonable 3 inference could be drawn -- when you report facts that 4 would constitute unlawful activity, the reasonable 5 inference is that you have objected. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Facts that would 7 constitute unlawful activity. What about facts that -8 I mean, many of these cases, of course, are 9 he-said/she-said cases, and what about the facts that 10 you are reporting confirm one side or the other? They 11 just ask you, look -- and, you know, the person says, 12 "Well, every day at three o'clock he came in and do 13 this," and you're outside. And he says, "No, I wasn't 14 there." 15 MS. BLATT: Right. If you just have a -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you opposing it 17 if you say -- you know, you are asked, "Well, you know, 18 you sit outside the office; did he come in there or 19 not?" And you say, "Yes, he did." 20 MS. BLATT: I think this is where we have 21 not embraced the position of the EEOC, that we don't 22 think that expresses opposition if all you do is say, 23 "here's what a person's job duties were and he was in 24 town on that day" or "I had lunch with him on that day," 25 and that would verify -- it may verify a victim's

1 statement or corroborate it and thereby be the essential 2 evidence in the case, but it wouldn't come within the 3 statutory language of opposing. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even you knew that 5 that was the critical fact in resolving the complaint? 6 MS. BLATT: If a reasonable -- well, if a 7 reasonable person knew from all the circumstances, then 8 maybe. If this -- unfortunately, if you don't like jury 9 trials, this is a jury question whether you oppose the 10 practice or not, and it would have to go to a jury based 11 on the totality of the evidence. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, since this is a case 13 where the -14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that the 15 participation clause is the line of least resistance. I 16 understand we have to say what a hearing is and so 17 forth. Are you asking us to resolve on the opposition 18 clause because that will give more guidance to the 19 system or -20 MS. BLATT: No. When you said "least 21 resistance," it certainly is the most sweeping and broad 22 coverage. In that sense, you cover all witnesses and 23 participants in the process, and we think Congress 24 intended to do so here. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The opposition

1 clause is? 2 MS. BLATT: The participation clause is much 3 broader coverage. It could -- it would cover anyone who 4 participates in the investigation, whether or not they 5 oppose the practice. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it depends how 7 you define the investigation -8 MS. BLATT: Opposition. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the inquiry, and 10 that's kind of a tough issue, it seems to me. 11 MS. BLATT: If this were before the EEOC, 12 everybody who testifies in that proceeding or 13 participates in the investigation would be covered. It 14 doesn't matter whether you oppose a practice. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 16 MS. BLATT: So in that sense, it's broader. 17 The reason why this case is easier for you, under the 18 opposition clause, is it's a narrow holding and it 19 doesn't get you into the question of whether just an 20 employer investigation is an investigation -21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess the 22 question I was asking earlier, you have overlapping but 23 not concentric categories, so the "opposing" may be 24 broader than the "participating in" depending upon how 25 we define either one.

1 MS. BLATT: That's exactly right, but at a 2 minimum when you have a victim of sexual harassment who 3 reports it to her employer in the context of an 4 investigation where she's asked was there anything 5 inappropriate and she recounts here, it's so clearly 6 opposition. It so clearly should not have been thrown 7 out on summary judgment. And it so clearly can force -8 JUSTICE STEVENS: You think -- you think the 9 conduct in this case is also covered by the 10 participation clause? 11 MS.

BLATT: Yes. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: The problem with that is 15 that I -- while I have the EEOC with me, say, on -16 assuming your thing -- on, from what I read, on the 17 opposition clause, when I looked into what the EEOC 18 actually said here on the participation clause, I don't 19 think I can characterize it, except for their litigation 20 position. 21 MS. BLATT: But that -22 JUSTICE BREYER: I can't characterize what 23 they've said in their compliance manual as being with 24 you on that. 25 MS. BLATT: That's correct. We don't and

1 neither does the EEOC interpret their compliance manual 2 as -3 JUSTICE BREYER: And they could easily 4 change it. They could easily change it. 5 MS.

BLATT: It's not in their compliance 11 manual; it's in our amicus brief, but it is the EEOC's 12 position. And, again, that's why I think it's an easier 13 case for you under the opposition clause. 14 JUSTICE ALITO: Can you think of any other 15 situation in which the law says that a person who 16 testifies or provides information is protected against 17 retaliation only if that person gives testimony of a 18 particular type or gives a statement of a particular 19 type? 20 MS. BLATT: No, but you have to remember 21 there are two separate clauses. The statute under the 22 opposition clause just says "oppose a practice made 23 unlawful." If you didn't oppose a practice, you're not 24 covered under that. You would be covered under -- in 25 the proceeding, why there is such broad coverage. Once

BLATT: I think -11 JUSTICE ALITO: If the purpose is to -- is 12 to elicit information and protect the people who come 13 forward with the information, then why don't you provide 14 the protection irrespective of what the person says? 15 MS. BLATT: I think that position is 16 consistent with the EEOC, and I don't think we would 17 oppose that position in the sense that it would give the 18 greatest and broadest protection. 19 And what is so upsetting about this case is 20 the gaping hole in statutory coverage that the Sixth 21 Circuit left. It is an inexplicable gap that a 22 complaining witness in an employer investigation would 23 be unprotected from retaliation. The statute simply 24 can't function, as intended by Congress, as intended by 25 this Court, if there are all these incentives for

Witnesses simply are going to be 10 afraid to fully cooperate if they're not given 11 protection. 12 And if there are no questions, we'd ask that 13 the Sixth Circuit be -14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the other side 15 says this is not an investigation. There was no charge 16 filed. She's filed no charge. So this is not a 17 qualifying investigation. What is the government's 18 position on that? 19 MS.

1 internal investigation is covered as long as somebody 2 has filed a charge. It's not clear who or that it has 3 to be related to the subject matter. And that would 4 mean if the investigation is conducted on the day a 5 charge is filed at noon, all the witnesses who came in, 6 in the morning, are unprotected; yet all the witnesses 7 who came in, in the afternoon, would be protected. Yet 8 nobody even knows that a charge has been filed. And 9 that's just not something that Congress possibly could 10 have intended and wanted to leave the morning witnesses 11 unprotected from retaliation. 12 So I don't think the current state of the 13 law under the participation clause is supported by the 14 text, and it's certainly not supported by any policy 15 under Title VII. 16 No questions? 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 18 Mr. Young. 19 ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS H. YOUNG 20 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 21 MR. YOUNG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 22 and may it please the Court: 23 Title VII was the result of a congressional 24 compromise which struck a balance between protecting the 25 interests of employees and employers.

1 In relation to the anti-retaliation 2 provisions of section 704, that balance was struck to 3 protect the rights of employees to report allegedly 4 discriminatory activity, as well as employers' rights to 5 manage their workplaces. The participation clause 6 covers activity or conduct in the course of an 7 investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII. 8 The opposition clause -- the actual words of 9 the opposition clause protect an employee who has 10 opposed a particular unlawful practice. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what more 12 could Ms. Crawford do to make it clear that she opposes 13 what was alleged in this case? 14 MR. YOUNG: She could have -- she could have 15 initiated making contact with the government official to 16 register a complaint or an objection. 17 Instead, she made a disclosure or she 18 cooperated in the investigation, Your Honor. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how can the 20 fact that what led to the statement change the 21 characterization of the statement? She can initiate it, 22 go in and say, "I oppose what's going on," or if 23 somebody just asks her, you know, "how do you feel about 24 what's going on," she says she opposes it. It seems to 25 me in either case you look at the statement and not what

In the first case, 6 she goes in of own volition and says, "I oppose"; in the 7 second case, she says "I oppose" in response to a 8 question. Congress used the word "oppose," and my 9 hypothetical in both cases used the word "oppose." 10 MR. YOUNG: If she's not taking the 11 initiative, then she has to report it and request that 12 something be done about it. Does the word -- if she 13 uses the word "oppose," as in your hypothetical, that 14 would not be the facts of this case, but that would 15 probably nudge it to the line of opposition conduct 16 because she's using the word "oppose." 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Well, is it 18 real a magic word? She comes in and says, "you won't 19 believe" -- you know -- "you think that's bad, wait till 20 I tell you what he did to me," and goes on tells -- it's 21 quite obvious from the context that she opposes it. 22 MR. YOUNG: Well, that's why we advocate a 23 reasonableness standard, Your Honor, in the ears of the 24 person receiving the information, but under the facts of 25 this case, that standard was not met.

There's no request that anything be done 12 about it.

You're 16 making the argument, essentially, that "oppose" has two 17 quite different meanings. You can ask somebody, you 18 know, do you oppose the war in Iraq? And all you're 19 asking is what is your opinion of the war in Iraq. Do 20 you think it is good or bad? 21 But "oppose" is also used in a quite 22 different sense. He -- you say somebody opposed the war 23 in Iraq, you mean he went out and -- and paraded against 24 it and so forth. 25 And your assertion is that in this

It asks whether you were actively -4 actively opposing it. 5 Now, once you adopt that position, I don't 6 see how the fact that you -- that something that was not 7 active opposition can be converted into active 8 opposition by something that occurred later. 9 I mean, if you want to abandon your other 10 argument, that's fine with me, but -11 (Laughter.) 12 MR.

And -- and you said 20 yes, I don't favor it, I think it's bad, I think it's a 21 bad idea, I -- as I understand your case, that's not 22 opposition. 23 MR.

YOUNG: I agree with that, Your Honor. 10 I used the term "practice" inartfully. Our argument is 11 there is a specific act that the employee considers to 12 be unlawful, and that's what the employee is opposing. 13 So that is what needs to be communicated to a reasonable 14 person within the government or within -15 JUSTICE SOUTER: If the -- if the employee 16 in response to the inquiry that's being made says yes, I 17 saw my employer do "X" and it happened -- and I think 18 it's terrible, that is certainly specific to the act. 19 MR.

She said, because the person in 11 this outfit who is charged with receiving complaints is 12 the harasser. 13 MR. YOUNG: That isn't -- that was her 14 contention.

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how about taking our 2 decisions in the Faragher and Ellerth case which in a 3 sense made the employer's internal investigation part of 4 the EEO process because it says to the employer, if you 5 don't have that find of effective internal complaint and 6 investigation procedure, then you're going to be stuck 7 on respondeat superior liability. If you do, then you 8 will be shielded. 9 So this Court's decision in those two cases 10 seemed to me to say to every employer, as part of your 11 EEO compliance you had better have this internal 12 complaint procedure and investigation. 13 MR. YOUNG: I agree. Faragher and Ellerth 14 put the carrot on the stick in front of the employers 15 and say, here's an affirmative defense that will be 16 available to you in certain harassment cases if you 17 adopt a -- an anti-harassment policy which includes an 18 investigation mechanism. However, such a policy and 19 such a mechanism is not made mandatory by Faragher and 20 Ellerth. The argument of -21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say it's not made 22 mandatory. Any employer who doesn't go through it is 23 crazy.

1 construe this indefinite term of "investigation" 2 to exclude this kind of employer activity which our 3 construction of the statute has virtually mandated. 4 So that if in fact the employer's 5 investigation succeeds in ending the problem and there 6 is no EEOC complaint, those who participated in the 7 investigation are absolutely helpless against 8 retaliation. That would be a bizarre way to interpret a 9 -- a statute in which we have any -- any opportunity to 10 interpret "investigation" to include this kind of 11 investigation. 12 What do you say to that? 13 MR.

Is the defense we recognized in 4 Ellerth and Faragher in the hostile work environment 5 case or in the specific action case as well? 6 MR. YOUNG: My understanding of Faragher and 7 Ellerth is that it -- it applies in the hostile work 8 environment case involving harassment by a supervisor. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you were going to 10 answer Justice Souter with the assertion that if indeed 11 the Court wants employers to conduct these 12 investigations, it does not want to reduce the incentive 13 to do so. 14 And the rule that is urged by the other side 15 means whenever the -- whenever the employer conducts 16 such an investigation, any employee who is smart enough 17 to come in and testify against -- against sexual 18 harassment has a guaranteed job. It is almost like -19 almost like being a Federal judge. 20 [Laughter.] 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't be fired after 22 that, or the employer can't fire her without opening 23 himself up to a lawsuit under -- under this provision. 24 And he might win the lawsuit, but it's going to cost 25 money. So why -- maybe an employer would rather say,

YOUNG: That would be the -- that would 5 be the employer's interest. The disincentive that the 6 employers would have to comply with these -- with this 7 Court's directives or strong suggestions in Faragher and 8 Ellerth is employers would stop conducting these 9 investigations if everyone they interviewed was going to 10 be a potential retaliation claim. 11 JUSTICE SOUTER: And instead they would 12 substitute the -- the response to an EEOC investigation 13 in which they would not have the leg to stand on in 14 opposing respondeat superior. I suppose that would be 15 an inducement for them to go ahead with the 16 investigation; wouldn't you? 17 MR. YOUNG: Their -- they would lose the 18 protections of Faragher and Ellerth. We would be back 19 to respondeat superior liability. It sounds illogical, 20 but I -- I submit to the Court that if -- that if it is 21 going to be a Hobson's choice and it -- it would be a 22 situation in which employers would have an incentive to 23 choose not to -- would choose to abandon their policies 24 and take their chances. 25 If they have to interview 20 people in a --

If -- if some type of discipline or 5 adverse action is imposed by the employer on any of 6 those employees, there is an instant retaliation claim. 7 JUSTICE SOUTER: By the way, I take it in -8 in this case, although this is not the issue before us, 9 that if you -- if you lose on the issues before us, it 10 is still your position that ultimately you should win 11 this case, because you have good evidence, you say in 12 your briefs, to indicate that the reason for firing had 13 nothing to do with retaliation. 14 That's true, isn't it? 15 MR.

Because of the abundant 6 evidence of misconduct which was discovered regarding 7 how Ms. Crawford was not running her office. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say it's not 9 that the employer is stuck because there's a potential 10 retaliation claim, if the employer is certain of its 11 grounds, that this discharge had nothing to do with her 12 testimony, then go ahead and discharge her. 13 MR.

The threshold is very high. 21 I've never recovered the fees in my 14 years working for 22 this office in a section 1983 case. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: So even when you win you 24 lose. 25 MR. YOUNG: Yes. In that sense, yes, Your

1 Honor. Or a Title VII case. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: On the other side, that 3 attorney, there's a large disincentive. He hasn't got a 4 good case. He's not going to be paid any retainer as 5 you might be. And he's not going to get any counsel 6 fees. Why should such -- why should it -- counsel be 7 available to a person who obviously was discharged for 8 having her hand in the till and not because she was 9 harassed? 10 MR. YOUNG: First of all, there is no 11 allegation that Ms. Crawford embezzled or took money. 12 There is no allegation, and she was not disciplined. 13 She was not discharged based on any allegation she was 14 stealing money. That's simply not a factor. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. I meant that as a 16 hypothetical. 17 MR. YOUNG: Oh, I'm sorry. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the reason that 19 she was -- what was the employer's reason for 20 discharging her? 21 MR. YOUNG: Multiple -- she was the payroll 22 coordinator and her office -- all these checks were 23 sitting in her office and they were not being processed. 24 Some of them were six, eight, ten months old. Her 25 office was in complete disarray. And this came to light

1 as a result of this sexual harassment investigation when 2 her subordinates were interviewed and they provided 3 testimony regarding how she was running her office, and 4 that eventually got to the finance department of the 5 government, which hired an outside auditor which went in 6 and generated all this evidence at great expense to the 7 metropolitan government to hire this outside auditor. 8 That's where the evidence was developed to 9 terminate Ms. Crawford six months after the statement to 10 the investigators. So that's -- those were the facts on 11 how it happened. 12 I forgot Your Honor's original question, or 13 maybe I answered it. I don't know. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I said if you have a 15 really strong case of having discharged this person for 16 cause that has nothing at all to do with harassment, you 17 are going to win the lawsuit and it would be hard for 18 the plaintiff to get a decent lawyer to represent her 19 side of the case because she's going to lose. 20 MR. YOUNG: In theory, yes; but the burdens 21 of litigation, which is part of the congressional 22 compromise -- back in 1964 in order to gain passage of 23 the Civil Rights Act, employer's interests were deemed 24 to be of equal magnitude as employees'. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not going to

1 win -- you're not going to win this case; you're going 2 to settle if you lose up here, right? 3 MR. YOUNG: If I lose up here, first I've 4 got two more shots at summary judgment, Your Honor. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't have to answer 6 that. We'll be glad to see you again. 7 (Laughter.) 8 MR. YOUNG: I hope I'm not -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is simply 10 that the incentive system is skewed because if you lose 11 you pay not only your attorneys' fees but the 12 complainants'. If you win, you have to incur yours. 13 MR. YOUNG: In civil rights cases the 14 incentives, that incentive fee, that incentive system, 15 is skewed against the defendants because of the public 16 policy reason favoring -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not saying it 18 shouldn't be. But in terms of the pressures towards 19 settlement, it is a very strong incentive. 20 MR. YOUNG: Yes. 21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is bringing frivolous 22 cases cost-free for the plaintiffs? There are certain 23 costs. 24 MR. YOUNG: Well, Your Honor, many of these 25 types of cases are taken on a contingent fee basis
51

1 except for hard costs. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: It is a mix. I mean, you 3 know, a lot of plaintiffs might be afraid to bring these 4 cases because they'll be accused of doing all kinds of 5 bad things. They don't want their reputations ruined. 6 They have lawyers who take contingent fees because they 7 have to pay for it. Oh the other hand, you have 8 problems with your costs and you have problems 9 dismissing people who should be dismissed. Everybody 10 has problems in this area. That's why we have law and 11 lawyers. They try to minimize it. This doesn't seem 12 fruitful to me. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't it true that 14 financially it is always cost-free for the plaintiff 15 because she has an attorney who is taking it on a 16 contingent basis? Now, you could say it's not cost-free 17 to the lawyer; but even that's not always true because 18 if the lawyer has nothing else to do he may as well be 19 doing this, you know, whatever the odds are. 20 MR. YOUNG: I agree with that, Your Honor. 21 And if the Court has no more questions, 22 thank you. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 24 Mr. Schnapper, you have four minutes 25 remaining.

1 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER 2 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 3 MR. SCHNAPPER: Thank you, Your Honor, may 4 it please the Court: 5 Protecting witnesses from being fired 6 because they provide information in internal 7 investigates is not going to interfere with the conduct 8 of those investigations or deter them. We know that 9 from experience. Until the decision in this case, no 10 one had questioned the applicability of the opposition 11 clause to a witness in an investigation who complains 12 about sexual harassment. It was simply not in dispute. 13 The compliance manual in this regard was entirely clear 14 since 2000 because the Commission took the position 15 witnesses who complained were protected by the 16 opposition clause. None of the problems Mr. Young 17 expressed concern about had happened. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, Ms. Blatt 19 said the government would prefer a decision under the 20 opposition ground as opposed to the participation. Do 21 you have a preference? 22 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think she said she thought 23 it was easier. We don't have a preference. But I'd 24 like to address briefly the participation clause. The 25 participation clause does have the singular value, as
53

1 Justice Alito suggested, that it is evenhanded, that it 2 will protect witnesses for both sides. And the 3 integrity of the process is certainly strengthened if 4 both witnesses, witnesses on both sides, know they're 5 protected from retaliation. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the only question -7 -the participation is not in doubt. The only question 8 is whether it's an investigation under this subtitle. 9 MR. SCHNAPPER: But the question is under 10 this title. That language its certainly broad enough, 11 as Justice Souter suggested, to encompass the sort of 12 process that's at issue here. As Justice Ginsburg 13 pointed out, this Court's decisions in Faragher 14 virtually mandate these decisions. 15 In response to the Chief Justice's point -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think the language 17 "investigation under this title" is the equivalent of 18 "investigation with respect to an alleged offense under 19 this title"? That doesn't strike me as self-evident at 20 all. It seems to me "investigation under this title" to 21 me means an investigation under this title, which is not 22 an investigation by the employer. 23 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think the words under this 24 title are elastic enough to support either meaning. The 25 context of the statute and the way this Court has
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 repeatedly construed it give meaning to it. In response 2 to the concern that the Chief Justice raised, Faragher 3 and Ellerth are not the only decisions that provide an 4 incentive for these investigations. The Court's 5 decision in Kolstad makes the existence of this sort of 6 process essential to avoid awards of punitive damages. 7 So even in non-harassment cases that same incentive has 8 been created by the courts. 9 In a situation involving harassment, the 10 contours of the investigation are fact largely shaped by 11 Federal law, not only policy guidance which the EEOC has 12 issued helping employers figure out what to do, but a 13 large and growing body of case law under Faragher and 14 Ellerth elucidating what those requirements are. 15 Particularly importantly here, the victims of sexual 16 harassment are virtually required by the court to use 17 these processes. Ms. Crawford had to speak up at some 18 point or she had had no claim. 19 And last, as a practical matter, if sexual 20 harassment is going to be stopped, it's mostly going to 21 happen through these internal processes. By the time 22 most of these controversies about sexual harassment get 23 to the EEOC or the courts, the victims have left their 24 jobs. In this Court's decision in Pollard, the 25 individual had been fired. In Souter she had been
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 driven from her job. In Faragher and Ellerth and 2 Harris, those had quit. If you look at the array of 3 lower court decisions involving sexual harassment, by 4 the time a case gets to the Commission in most of those 5 cases the victim has give up and left. 6 So it's exceptionally important that these 7 processes be effective and evenhanded. 8 No further questions. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 10 The case is submitted. 11 (Whereupon, at 1:59 p.m., the case in the 12 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
