    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether the participation of a non-Article III judge on an improperly constituted panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals renders the decision of that panel void. The parties are in agreement that the designation of Judge Munson, who sits for a 10-year term on the Ninth Circuit panel, violated the statute pertaining to designations. But that statute does more work than simply govern designations. That statute protects the Article III character of the circuit courts of appeals by ensuring that only Article III judges are designated to sit on the Circuit courts of appeals."

    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "Well, the additional point I was going to make in response to Justice O'Connor's question is that, in fact, even though there may be consent or even though there may be waiver, that has not stopped this Court from considering these important structural limitations in the past."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but what -- what is your position? Can the right be waived or not? I mean, if -- if you say the right can be waived, then it's just a question of whether or not they knew or should have known or something like that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "I think that the decision is void, and so the position -- the position would be that although all Article III provisions can be waived, in this instance because of the nature of the structural error, the consent or the waiver would not matter at all."

That doesn't sound to me the -- the -- like the way the system ought to work."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "But, Justice Scalia, I think that relies upon counsel in that situation being confident that this Court would grant a writ of certiorari. I -- I think that that kind of gamesmanship is really quite far-fetched. This Court does not sit as a court of errors. So even though I as counsel know that that might be error below, I would still have to -- I would have to be relying on the -- the equivalent of legal lightning striking, so to speak, in order to -- to be certain that that error would be corrected."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Green, how does Article III -- how can Article III be claimed by your client who was tried not before an Article III court, before a territorial court -- your client has no entitlement to an Article III court. So this seems -- you're addressing an abstract question about the proper composition of a Ninth Circuit panel. Yet, your litigant, your client has no entitlement to an Article III tribunal either at trial or on appeal. So I think that there's a serious problem of whether your clients are positioned to raise the proper composition of an Article III court when they are not even entitled to an Article III court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "That is true as a general matter at the trial court stage. However, it -- it's very much our position here -- and I would disagree with the premise only insofar as you said as to the court of appeals. Congress vested jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C., section 1291, over appeals from the territories in the United States Circuit Court of Appeals."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, but it didn't have to. In other words, a case -- an Article III -- a case in which litigants are entitled to an Article III tribunal then must go to an Article III court. Here Congress did designate the Ninth Circuit to hear these appeals from non-Article III trial courts. But your clients -- Congress didn't have to do that with respect to your clients. Congress could have given them an Article IV appellate tribunal and that would have been okay."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "No. I -- When Congress vests jurisdiction in the United States courts of appeals, it does so not only to its -- in accordance not only with its plenary power over the territories under Article IV, but also pursuant to Article III. When Congress creates any inferior court and creates a jurisdiction in those courts, we would maintain that -- that Congress is acting pursuant to Article III. And in this instance --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But when Congress created the district court for the Northern Marianas, for Guam, what authority was it exercising?"

    "speaker": "GREEN",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I -- I assume you've got a -- maybe I'm wrong, but I assume you've got a fall-back and that is, okay, if you don't accept -- we don't accept the constitutional position, you're still claiming that you have a legal entitlement to the Ninth Circuit and, hence, to a completely Article III court."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "That -- that's exactly correct."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And that could be true if Congress was acting under -- under Article IV."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "That -- that's correct. Even if Congress was acting under Article IV, the statute plainly vests jurisdiction, and it -- and it provides for independent -- independent review of these appeals by an Article III court. To -- to -- as respondent suggests, to -- to argue that a panel of the court of appeals could be specially constituted for these appeals would rewrite section 1291. Section 1291 says in very plain terms that jurisdiction shall vest in the court of appeals."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Green, suppose -- suppose I disagree with you that -- that you -- you can sit through a trial and not object with -- with impunity, and -- and I think that you lose here unless you can show plain error and the usual requirements for avoiding the rule about -- about contemporaneous objection. Why do you come within the plain error requirements and, in particular, the requirement that -- that there have -- that -- that the mistake seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings? Why -- why is that the case? You acknowledge that your client could have been tried by non-Article III judges. You acknowledge that the judge who sat, although he was non-Article III, was a Federal judge properly appointed. He could have tried your client. So how can I say that this -- that the proceeding -- yes, there was a -- there was a mistake, but did -- was it -- was it a mistake that seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceeding? I -- I just don't see that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "In the following senses, Justice Scalia, it did affect it. First of all, with respect to fairness, the Ninth Circuit is -- is a court of fully independent review, and I would maintain that precisely because the petitioners here were tried by an Article IV court, it makes sense, and it may actually be constitutionally required that in some sense their -- their appellate review is had by an Article III court. But in any event, Congress statutorily vested jurisdiction in a fully independent Article III court, and as a result of doing so, to put Judge Munson who sits for a 10-year term on a panel as a co-equal participant would affect the fairness of the court. We have a unique --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Suppose the panel had included a judge who was holding a recess appointment, a Federal judge who was appointed on a recess basis and therefore at that point didn't have secure tenure?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "I -- I think there would be issues of -- of qualification there, and there might even be -- where a -- a recess appointment was -- was held in a -- in a qualified sense, then I would say that was an Article III -- an Article III qualification for an Article III court potentially. If there were issues as to the qualification, we might be in the realm of the de facto officer doctrine."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But Justice Scalia's question, at least as I understood it, I think meant for you to concentrate on why -- why this would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, so to speak."

    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "Yes, and -- and I would add to my response to Justice Scalia that we have an amicus brief here from Judge Moore who sits in precisely the same seat, so to speak, that Judge Munson sits as a territorial judge in the Virgin Islands. The amicus brief of Judge Moore points out very plainly that he views himself as open to question with regard to his impartiality because he is subject to the hostile treatment -- to use Justice Douglas' phraseology, the hostile treatment of the press and the -- and the glowering disfavor of those who have in their hands the power of reappointment."

    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "All right. Let's assume away the statutory argument for the moment. There you have the problem -- you're -- you're right that it's contrary to the statute, but maybe it isn't plain error. I'm focusing only on the constitutional argument, and from the point of view of the constitutional argument, I would like you to assume the statute says the opposite. The statute says that this judge can sit. All right. So purposes of a constitutional argument, why can't your party waive -- why can't your clients have waived that? My particular thought is that we're just considering a case in which -- a different case in which it's at least arguable -- there are two sides to the argument -- whether two parties can get together and have a magistrate, who is not an Article III judge, try their case. The consent simply consisting of the fact they went ahead without objection. In that case, there's the statute, but for present purposes, we're assuming the opposite statute. So I mean, if it's at least arguable that you could have consent, shown only by the fact they went ahead to a trial before a magistrate and that would be enough to validate constitutionally the magistrate trying the case, why isn't the fact that you went ahead here constitutionally sufficient to show that you agreed to the trial before -- the -- the appeal that included one judge from Guam?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "The Court has -- the Court has never before held that it would be permissible for a -- or for a magistrate to conduct a full trial. And that I would maintain because that also might affect institutional interests could also not be subject to waiver or consent."

    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "That's -- that argument is certainly --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "-- if we agree with you then, if we agree with you that consent through behavior is not good enough constitutionally, we would also be saying it is unconstitutional to have consent to a trial before a magistrate. You see, that's quite a -- a -- if you're going to say yes to that, that's a problem."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "No, I -- I understand that. But again, I'm -- I'm going to go to the dividing line between Article III interests and Appointments Clause interests and those structural limitations and structural protections in the court system which are not quite the same as the kind of structural trial errors that this Court has addressed in -- in Gomez, that this Court addressed last term in Cotton. Those really are errors that go to the validity of the claim, not necessarily to the validity of the -- or to the very validity of the institutional interests. I think the hypothetical that you posit is actually Glidden, and in Glidden, this Court held that even where the designation of the judges from the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals was lawful in that sense, the Court took pains to look and see whether the courts from which those judges were designated were Article III courts."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, Glidden -- really there was no -- no opinion for the Court in that case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "No, there wasn't, but the Chief Justice and Justice Clark in that case concurred in the result, and the difference that they had with the majority was that they didn't think that Bakelite and Williams should be deemed overruled, only that they had been superseded by subsequent events, including the grant of lifetime tenure to the judges on the Court of Claims and to the -- to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But they -- they didn't join the opinion, did they, of Justice --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "In the Government's brief, they mention a conversation with the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit by a former lawyer for your client. I'm curious to know, A, whether you disagree with what is said, and B, how did they get in -- how does that get before us?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "I can't answer the second question. To be frank, I'd like to know the answer to the second question as well. But as to the first question, I really would start with the proposition that I don't think it matters. I -- I don't think it matters here. The conversation, even as reported by respondents, would not in -- in my mind and in our position constitute a waiver or consent. The issue of who hears your appeal is probably so important that it's necessary that that be done somehow in the defendant's presence. Respondent relies on Olano. In Olano, the Court took pains to point out that the defendants were present when the discussions of whether the -- the alternate jurors could deliberate or not. Here I would say this is -- this would be the same sort of issue subject to the same sort of waiver and consent requirements."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's odd in a -- in a circuit that has the vast majority of its appeals decided without any oral argument. You said that the defendant has to be there? Your party has to be there?"

  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "I think for -- he doesn't have to be there, but there would have to be some indication on -- on the record, in addition to the conversation that -- that respondents recite, that -- that Petitioner Nguyen understood that there was -- that -- that she was waiving some important right to a fully independent review by an Article III court. And I want to stress, as I say that, that -- that this claim that respondents make with respect to waiver and consent really affects only one of the petitioners here. We have to continue with the -- with the case of Petitioner Phan for whom no oral argument was made."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But this important right that you -- you were relying on, it's her right only because there happens to be a statute that sets up the Ninth Circuit as the appellate forum. You have recognized that she did not have any independent right to that kind of forum. She could have had -- since the court -- the -- the authority at trial is determined by Article IV, similarly for territory authority on appeal."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "But even if she had only a statutory right in that sense, it's -- it is the case that Congress creates jurisdiction and creates the inferior courts pursuant to Article III under a statute. That doesn't mean that constitutional protections and constitutional rights don't attend the statutory grants of jurisdiction and -- and the activities of the courts that are created pursuant to Article III. There are numerous examples of -- of pure statutory rights. Let's take, for example, the right to appeal. That is merely a statutory right. This Court has not held that that's a constitutional right."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",
    "speech": "That is true, but this Court has held in cases that involve similar Article III issues and similar issues of the Appointments Clause that -- that issues of consent and waiver are not dispositive. A fortiori then, I think issues of forfeiture would not be dispositive."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

I assume for that purpose that the statute says, the Ninth Circuit shall travel to Guam and hear appeals and for purposes of this -- for purposes of this voyage to Guam to hear the appeal, the make-up of the panel will be two Article III judges and one Article I judge. All right? That's the statute. Now, why is that unconstitutional? I cannot -- it's very unusual, but I cannot think of any due process right of any Guam person who would be hurt, and I cannot think of -- why it's wrong to ask an Article III judge to take on this additional adjudicatory function with an Article I judge sitting next to him. It's purely adjudicatory. It's not handing out radio licenses. It's not doing anything else that's unsuitable to a judge. Why not? That's the merits of the question, and I'm not saying it has an obvious answer, but I want to hear your answer."

I want to know why it forbids it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GREEN",

Benson, and -- and Crowell's reaffirmation in -- in Northern -- or rather, Thomas. There is a significant issue as to whether you can have territorial judges exercising precisely the same kind of almost Article III jurisprudence that district -- regular Article III district judges have and -- and not have some sort of Article III review from that."

It wouldn't be asked to do some sort of Article I function. And would doing that function so distract or withdraw from the burden -- I'm sorry -- distract or interrupt the judge's -- or court's ability to function as an Article III court. That would be the analysis. Now, to -- to put a finer point on it, in fact -- and the reason I have to take the position it would be okay, is Congress has enacted a statute, 28 U.S.C. 297, which authorizes judges of the Ninth Circuit to go sit in the Freely Associated Compact States, which is Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, which are not --"

I -- I assume that the law of the circuit is something the Ninth -- Ninth Circuit is proud of. Is it going to now have under -- under your theory an -- an asterisk by the opinions that are written by non-Article III judges so that that's not so much the law of the circuit?

Could Congress say your appeal will be within the limit -- as long as it doesn't violate due process or a fundamental right, will be to three State court judges? Yes. Now, the more difficult question is, could you have the combination as we had here?

  },
  {
    "speaker": "MILLETT",
    "speech": "Well, Justice Kennedy, the way we get to this position is two steps. Is first -- there isn't, obviously, clearly on point, but if you add Mistretta to Morrison versus Olson, which had a delegation of non-Article III functions to -- to -- that's the -- the independent counsel case -- to the special division that appoints the independent counsel -- and so you combine that and you combine that with the precedents on sharing of power with magistrate judges -- those together -- and then add to all of that the very limited constitutional rights to -- to a particular form of tribunal accorded to people in the territories. But I also wanted to get back -- we think that it could be defended. But even if the answer is no, we don't think the constitutional violation would be plain error. But to get back to your binding precedent point, which I think is an important one, it's -- there's three things to keep in mind. First of all, whether this is a binding precedent or not has absolutely no effect on the claims of these individual defendants. Their position would be the same if the decision were unpublished. And I think the Ninth Circuit has itself in a difficult position here. It should address, in the first case, the power of this precedent. And it's not an issue this Court has never considered. In Glidden -- the Glidden Company case, the two concurring Justices specifically said -- they -- they agreed that the court was competent at least -- it was an Article III court -- after -- at least after Congress had passed the statute giving them that status. But if those two concurring Justices, which provided the most narrow ground for decisions in that case, specifically said that they would think -- they would uphold the validity of those decisions that were issued prior to Congress' action. And I think this Court's de facto officer doctrine would speak to whether unchallenged -- unchallenged opinions should at some point have --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Ms. Millett, I'm surprised at the answers that you're giving, that they're not prefaced by what you said -- I thought you said -- in your brief which was that Congress did not enact a statute that allowed the Ninth Circuit to include one of these judges. The Court shouldn't speculate on the constitutionality of a different statute. The statute that Congress, in fact, enacted said that it was wrong to include this judge, and so the only question should be what is the consequence of the Ninth Circuit having failed to follow the statute that Congress enacted instead of speculating on, oh, suppose Congress had, in fact, enacted -- enacted such a statute. But you -- you seem to be engaging in the -- the hypothetical statute that Congress didn't enact to determine whether it would be constitutional."

And there is, in fact, a serious question about the integrity of the court when the composition of the court is simply illegal. And so, if you want to stick to waiver, I don't know what the answer is to Justice Stevens' problem. The -- the alternative to waiver is to face the fact that there's something seriously wrong with a court which is unabashedly illegally constituted."

We don't think this is an unconstitutional issue. But waiver is not the same as it's something the parties can freely take or drop because you have to go back and -- to the step before that and say this is wrong and it won't be done and it shouldn't be done. But if we assume that -- we're -- we're in the context of plain error analysis here. That's why the concept of waiver is being discussed. It's not whether a mistake was made or whether these people have the right freely to choose. They don't, under the statute, have the right freely to choose what the composition of the panel will -- will be. We agree with that. But when no objection was made below, proceedings were completed, an appeal was completed without any objection, they fully and freely participated in that, and it was only after the outcome that they turned around to challenge the -- the composition of their court, that's an important value too."

Now, I take it in all these hypotheticals where the Ninth Circuit is deliberately, which I don't think they'd do, defying a congressional statute, getting everybody to have waivers on the record, which are totally contrary to what Congress said, that it would seriously interfere with the integrity.

That is -- is it was wrong. We all know it's wrong, and -- and -- but do these -- does it -- did it really hurt the interests either of these defendants or, in this particular proceeding, did it offend judicial integrity. And we think because of the narrow context in which this was decided -- it was a territorial case -- to have a territorial judge sitting with two Ninth Circuit judges, statutorily wrong -- maybe there's debate about whether it would be constitutionally permissible. But it did not make this no longer a court. It did not rise to the level of race discrimination or total --"

    "speech": "Well, Ms. -- Ms. Millett, may I interrupt you there? I mean, you have said -- and -- and I understand what you're getting at. That does not make this no longer a court. But in -- in a way that sort of begs the question because the one thing that is plain is that this so-called court is not the court that the statute calls for. So far as the statutory definition of the appropriate court to hear this appeal, this court is illegally constituted. And don't we -- even if we confine our concern to this one instance, don't we have a reason to find that that fact does go to the integrity of the proceeding for the purposes of the plain error rule?"

But it's not that far, if you think of what happens when a panel sits and then a judge recuses himself after argument, once the case is submitted. And so they have participated. Their -- obviously their name would not be on the opinion. That would be one distinction. But the fact that the judge sat there and participated and could have had some influence -- it would be unknown -- would not go to the power of the court to act. And this Court has made the distinctions in Ex parte Ward, four Justices in the Freytag, and as far back as Martin versus Hunter's Lessee, the power of the court to act, the Ninth Circuit to act with a quorum here, is to be distinguished from the lawfulness which -- with which they acted. In Ex parte Ward, a -- a recess appointment Federal judge, who lacked tenure, by -- by definition lacked salary guarantees, sat."

    "speaker": "MILLETT",
    "speech": "Right. Right, certainly prong four goes far beyond jurisdiction. But what makes this not offend judicial integrity is that territorial residents who have no right to an Article III compliant tribunal had their case heard by three Federal judges. It was heard fairly. They had no disqualifying constitutional due process biases. They rendered a unanimous decision on overwhelming evidence in the face of highly discretionary challenges. And so -- and -- and you have combined with that what Justice Scalia referred to in discussing with -- with counsel for petitioner, the -- the counter-concern that there's a judicial integrity problem with allowing people to proceed before a court and then wait until there's an adverse outcome to challenge who it was that rendered that decision. And so taking all of those factors together in the particular, peculiar context of territorial residents, we don't think this offended judicial integrity or the reputation of these proceedings. They had three judges, not a judge and a layperson, not a judge and a child. They had three judges. There was no unconstitutional bias. There was full consideration of their arguments. They had every opportunity, if they didn't want this panel, to raise an objection, but they didn't. They took it. They went with the judgment, and it's now, under the plain error doctrine, I think too late in the day to object to the composition of the panel."

  {
    "speaker": "MILLETT",
    "speech": "Justice Kennedy, I think defense counsel are frequently -- had to -- have to make difficult decisions. They have to decide whether they want to alienate the jury by objecting to evidence. Do they want to alienate the judge by seeming too obstreperous? Do they want to seem like they're hiding something from the jury? They have to make these difficult decisions, but the whole point of an adversarial system is that defense counsel is charged with doing that and you have to strike balances. And if on balance they decided, which I don't think counsel should think about their own reputation in defending their clients, but if they decided it would be better not to make the panel angry, I'm not going to object, that's a strategic choice that they've made. But at the same time, they may have made the decision, this is a good panel for us. We don't know. There's nothing inherently prejudicial. Unlike most harmless error or plain errors where it's inherently prejudicial to a defendant to admit a confession or suppress evidence about the circumstances of the confession, there's nothing inherently prejudicial ex ante, up front about a particular judge sitting. And so there's important --"

These judges are, as we discussed earlier, interpreting Federal law. This was a case about laws that arose from -- from And, Justice Souter, I would point out that with respect to integrity here, I -- I think it would be -- it would have more integrity, oddly enough, for the court to have sat with the director of tourism of Guam. Now, I say that because Judge Moore points out in his amicus brief that -- that he is open to attack on the ground of whether he's impartial to the Government. And -- and here Judge Munson was sitting on a case in which the Government was the opposing party. I would add too that this is the kind of case where the Court can -- can articulate a high wall, a bright line for Congress. When Congress vests jurisdiction in an Article III court, that means Article III review. That decision or that principle is implicit in Glidden, and this case represents the missing piece of that puzzle. If there are no further questions."
