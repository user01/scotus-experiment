  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNORR",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In its decisions a few years ago in the Ellerth and Faragher cases, this Court held that where a supervisor has created a hostile work environment by acts of sexual harassment, the liability of the employer is not strict, but rather is subject to an affirmative defense which centers around the opportunities provided by the employer for corrective or preventive action. The question here is whether that affirmative defense should continue to be available where there is an allegation that the hostile work environment resulted in a constructive discharge, and we submit that it should. In our view there is nothing about a claim of constructive discharge that changes the Ellerth-Faragher analysis of hostile work environments. A supervisor's acts which create a hostile work environment don't produce strict liability because they are not acts of agency; that is, they are not the acts of the employer. They don't bear the imprimatur of the employer. They aren't ratified by the employer, and they are not the sorts of things which could only be done by somebody invoking the authority of the employer."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Knorr, I'm -- I had a hard time, in reading the briefs on this case, figuring out what we ought to do with the suggestion that there's a constructive discharge theory. Now, I don't think this Court has ever weighed in on that. It comes out of the labor law context I guess."

    "speaker": "KNORR",
    "speech": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I'm wondering, you know, in -- in Ellerth and Faragher, what we said was that when no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to the liability. So I'm wondering if we shouldn't just try to look at the facts in this case and ask whether what the supervisors did amounted to a tangible employment action and that would answer the -- the question. I -- I don't know that viewing it through the lens of a constructive discharge is helpful. What she says is that the supervisors -- that she had taken tests to qualify for a promotion, that the supervisors had hidden the results of those tests and had thereby prevented any promotion, and that there was a false arrest I guess. Now, why shouldn't we just look to see if those actions occurred, and if so, whether they amounted to a tangible employment action? Wouldn't that answer the question?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNORR",
    "speech": "Justice -- Justice O'Connor, if we haven't made this clear, then the Court has my sincerest apologies because that is exactly what we suggest the Court should do. If the underlying actions of the supervisor amounted -- which -- which provoked the constructive discharge amounted to a tangible employment action, then there is no affirmative defense."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But -- but Justice O'Connor is going a little bit further than that. I think she is suggesting that there cannot be a constructive discharge without some tangible employment action because constructive discharge itself attributes to the employer the desire to get rid of the employee, and that desire cannot simply be communicated through some lower -- lower people. Now, maybe the -- the tangible employment action is the refusal of the employer to respond when the obscene actions of -- of the -- of the coworkers here are brought to the employer's attention. That would be I -- would that qualify as tangible action in -- in your part -- in your estimation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNORR",
    "speech": "I'm not sure if it would be tangible action or not, but it would certainly indicate that if the employer didn't respond, that it was in some sense ratifying or approving what it has done."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I mean, the point is, how can you have a constructive discharge? The only person that can discharge is the employer. You have to pin it on the employer. I don't know how -- how subordinates alone can -- can produce a situation that amounts to a constructive discharge."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNORR",
    "speech": "That, Justice Scalia, is partly true and it partly is not true because the precise elements of what you need to prove to -- to get a constructive discharge vary quite widely from court to court. And in some courts what you say is quite accurate. There has to be some proof of an intention on the part of the employer, even if it's only through a failure to respond to a complaint, to get rid of the employee. But in other courts -- and -- and this includes the Third Circuit -­ that is not really the case."

Is -- is there any -- is there any jurisdiction in which the employee's reasonableness in trying to adjust things before leaving is not an element of the -- of the claim?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNORR",
    "speech": "I think that the short answer to that question is yes. There are such jurisdictions and they include the Third Circuit, but I need to be a little more expansive than that because in all jurisdictions, including -- including the Third Circuit, there is an inquiry into whether the employee acted reasonably, but -­ and in some jurisdictions, that inquiry is directed to -­ to the question of whether the employee tried to resolve this -- this matter internally. In other jurisdictions, including the -- the Third Circuit, the inquiry into employee reasonableness is tied only to the question of how bad were the conditions; that is, were these conditions so bad that a reasonable person would quit? And in that inquiry, it may or may not even be relevant whether the employee tried to -- to resolve it internally."

    "speaker": "KNORR",

That is, if the conditions were bad enough, it doesn't matter if there was an anti-harassment policy. It doesn't matter if there were remedial efforts made. So the -- the inquiry, while it all is -- while it is all -- while it is always phrased in terms of employee reasonableness, can really be directed to quite different things."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "May I ask you also to clarify? That -- you gave Justice O'Connor an answer that surprised me because she said let's stick to this case, and she said that action involving the not -- not letting her have her papers, and then the arrest, that looking at those facts, could that be -- is that the way the Court should go about it. But the district judge gave summary judgment for you in this case. Is that not so?"

  {
    "speaker": "KNORR",
    "speech": "There -- well, there was no trial. There was certainly evidence submitted, and it seems to us that when we as the defendants say we are entitled to the affirmative defense and we are moving for summary judgment on it, it's incumbent on the plaintiff at that point to say, no, you aren't entitled even to assert the affirmative defense because we have this action and this action and this action which were taken, which are tangible employment actions, and therefore you aren't even entitled to the affirmative defense. And that didn't happen. At no point in this case has the respondent ever said that she was subjected to a tangible employment action other than the constructive discharge itself."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Suppose we're back before the summary judgment stage and you're telling the trial court what the theory of the case should be. Would your theory be something like this? Whether we use the phrase, constructive discharge or tangible employment action -­ and we have to use some phrase because the law works with labels -- we're interested in the practical aspects of -­ of these cases, and one of them is this. Were there avenues of redress? And if the employer was -- employee was unreasonable in not following these avenues of redress, then there can be no constructive discharge or tangible employment action. Is that your position?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNORR",
    "speech": "Our -- our position really is that this case and -- and hostile environment cases generally which are alleged to be constructive discharges are just like Ellerth, that what you do is you look at what the supervisor did to the employee to provoke the discharge, and if those actions were hostile work environment, if they were -- if they were -- I hate to use the word merely, but if they were acts of sexual harassment, not arising to tangible actions, if the employee had simply sued on the hostile work environment, we'd have an affirmative defense. Our position is that doesn't change or it shouldn't change because there is also a claim that it was so bad that I had to quit."
  },

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "How is that different from the formulation that one component in almost all cases of constructive discharge or tangible employment action, whatever you want to call it, is the existence or nonexistence of avenues for redress, and if they did exist, whether the employee took reasonable steps to follow them."

I was -- why isn't the way to simplify the problem and decide this case for us to say in order to have constructive discharge, there has got to be the element that Justice Kennedy just described, i.e., avenues of redress, reasonableness on the part of the employee in availing or perhaps in some cases not availing of them? If that element is shown, then there is no point in recognizing the affirmative defense because that is in pretty clear contradiction to one element of the affirmative defense. And -- and that would make for a fairly simple body of law. Why -- why isn't that the appropriate way for us to go?"

Another is they did take a tangible action against me, they didn't discharge me, but they were so bad in harassing me and in this demotion, that it amounted to a constructive discharge.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "GORNSTEIN",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: An employer is strictly liable for a constructive discharge in any harassment that has preceded it only when the constructive discharge comes about as a result of an official company act, such as a demotion. If the constructive discharge comes about as a result of a supervisor's creation of a hostile environment, then the employer has an affirmative defense and can show that the plaintiff unreasonably bypassed available opportunities for correction. Now, the requirement of an official company act as a predicate for strict liability comes from the Court's decision in Ellerth and is supported by two important considerations. First, a company act is the kind of act that is likely to be documented and subject to higher levels of review, and so it's the kind of act over which the employer can exert the most control. And that heightened potential to control makes it fair to hold the employer strictly liable, even if in a particular case the employer would otherwise be able to show that it acted reasonably and the plaintiff did not. It -- it -- second of all, furthering title VII's -- the -- recognizing the affirmative defense when there's not an official company act, furthers title VII's prophylactic purposes because it gives the employer an extra incentive to create policies that will help to prevent discrimination from occurring in the first place and it gives employees an added incentive to complain before problems become Title VII violations."

And if you did that, you should say that to prove constructive discharge, a plaintiff has to show that there's no reasonable other alternative other than to resign. And a plaintiff who has unreasonably bypassed an available opportunity for correction can't make out a constructive discharge claim in the first place."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, but the hostile work environment claim -- and if -- if we're going to recognize constructive discharge, hostile work environment I -- I presume has been subsumed under constructive discharge because constructive discharge says, hostile environment plus something more. And we've been describing the plus something more. And -- and in order to prove the plus something more, you've got to prove, as you said, something which is inconsistent with the affirmative defense."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GORNSTEIN",

You could have a situation in which at the moment of resignation, the plaintiff was reasonable in believing that there was nothing she could do other than to resign and reasonable in bypassing the available procedures at the moment of resignation, therefore, could prove a constructive discharge. But it may have been the case that at a prior point in time, she would have been unreasonable in failing to complain about the harassment and therefore be vulnerable to the affirmative defense on the hostile environment claim even though she's proven her constructive discharge."

In other words, every case is going to involve allegations of what you just say, denials of those allegations. In order to have an administrable system, shouldn't we simply say that if you can prove the constructive discharge, if the -- if the element includes the unreasonableness on grievance, no affirmative defense, and just get over with it simply because otherwise it would be just too complicated a system?"

And all we're saying is that should be fleshed out. If you don't think that should be fleshed out, if the Court didn't think that that was a possibility, then there wouldn't be the need for the -- the remand.

If it's not brought about by an official company act, then the affirmative -- no affirmative defense for the constructive discharge because that's been negated by proving constructive discharge. But there is affirmative defense for the prior acts leading up to it that are framed as a claim about hostile environment.

The question presented is whether a constructive discharge is the equivalent of a formal discharge. One of the greatest difficulties in dealing with the law that we're addressing today is one of semantics. A formal discharge is the equivalent of a constructive discharge by definition. It is a -- it is a matter of methodology. The United States and the petitioner would have this Court define the culpability of the employer for the supervisor's acts as a matter of official act. That leads this Court down an incredibly complex road of -- of definitional problems. If the Court goes back to Meritor, the Chief Justice's opinion, where the Court held clearly there is no automatic liability for the employer's being responsible for the wayward acts, clearly outside the scope of employment, clearly not authorized, but we're not going to find a -- a -- an automatic liability. What the United States wants to do and why the respondent believes that the Third Circuit -- that the Third Circuit Court of Appeals decided this case properly is to devise a general rule and underline if proven, if the constructive discharge is proven, then the obvious occurs. It's a tangible employment action."

They still go, however, at their core to the conduct and actions of the supervisor. Now, unquestionably, the supervisor -- the supervisor's actions are not authorized by the employer. Clearly they're not. The imputation that the Congress made of employer liability for agent actions was a policy consideration goal and this Court, in an effort to balance judgments and to balance realities in the workplace and achieve justice in terms of what is fair if you have that hardworking employer who works very, very arduously at structuring a workplace program and enforces it -- not the case here -- but enforces it and follows through with it, there should be some recognition, some issue of mitigation. And under those circumstances, of course, depending upon what the trial court finds and -- and depending upon how this Court decides that constructive discharge if it is a tangible employment action, how -­ what role it plays and what -- what the demands or requirements this Court would have in Title VII situations so that -- so that -- the official act, which the Government would say is not a tangible employment action, in reality has to be.

The EEO officer tells another story, and we don't know how grievances have been handled in this workplace, whether it has been effective for other employees in the past.

Now, technically speaking -- technically speaking -- and the district court didn't even get into this, but to do fair and honest response to your question, Nancy Suders did not go and acquire the exact form.

If there's any question, let's look at the last day. And if we look at the last day, Nancy Drew Suders is brought in. The bathroom, the toilet seat, the handle, everything is dusted with stuff -- powder. Her test results are taken. They're stuffed in the lingerie drawer. Nancy Suders happens to find them. They set the room up, and Nancy Suders is brought in and her hands are photographed and she's read her rights. And she's called a thief repeatedly and she's told she can't leave. And then finally, hands shaking, having drafted a resignation letter, she presents it. So until the last day, which is where the hypothetical I was left with ended, it might be arguable that Nancy Drew Suders -- if we want to craft a rule which says -- and we -- and if it's possible to do -- which says there is some point in time where the burden arises for the employee to take a countermeasure or counteraction, when is that? How do we do that? How can we craft a general rule that way?"

Nothing specific at all about what's going on. And then very far down the road -- one question is did she complain too late. What would have happened?

The issue then becomes, in terms of -- of if -­ if we're looking at her actions in terms -- in a context of did she take -- did she assume that employee burden of reasonably responding, putting all of those things together, that's where the Third Circuit I think correctly analyzed that there -- that that Nancy Drew Suders acted reasonably.

It's -- the difference is that Virginia Smith-Elliot said that Nancy Drew Suders complained about age and a number of different complaints that were being -- or -- or mistreatments she was suffering, but that she did not raise sexual harassment as an issue.
