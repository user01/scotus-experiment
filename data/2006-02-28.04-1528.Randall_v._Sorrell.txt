1 PROCEEDINGS

2 (10:11 a.m.)

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in 04-1528, Randall v. Sorrell, and

5 the consolidated cases.

6 Mr. Bopp.

7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.

8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9 IN NOS. 04-1528 AND 04-1530

10 MR. BOPP: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and

11 may it please the Court:

12 As this Court made clear recently in

13 Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, since political

14 candidates are the ones who take office, it is

15 imperative that they be allowed freely to express

16 themselves on matters of current public importance. As

17 a result, this Court has never allowed the government

18 to prohibit candidates from communicating relevant

19 information to voters during an election.

20 Vermont, however, has adopted low expenditure

21 and contribution limits for the opposite purpose,

22 reducing overall candidate campaign spending, and these

23 limits would have that effect. This is fundamentally

24 incompatible with any reasonable interpretation of the

25 First Amendment and is not justified by any truly

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 compelling governmental interest. As a result, they

2 are unconstitutional.

3 Now, Vermont's expenditure limits are an

4 unprecedented, direct restraint on candidate speech.

5 Once these low expenditure limits are exhausted, a

6 candidate may not drive to the village green to address

7 a rally, may not return the phone call from a reporter

8 at the local newspaper, and may not call a neighbor to

9 urge her to get out to vote. This Court has never

10 allowed the government to prohibit candidates from

11 communicating this sort of relevant information during

12 a campaign.

13 Further, this Court has long held that more

14 speech is better than less speech. As long as

15 contribution limits are available to address any

16 realistic concerns about corruption, the public will

17 benefit from candidates' being allowed to spend all

18 that they can lawfully raise in their campaign.

19 Now, the record is clear in this case that

20 the expenditure limits will deprive candidates of

21 substantial resources. The district court erroneously

22 looked at average spending over the last three

23 elections and found that in all but one category, that

24 is, Senate candidates running in single-member

25 districts, that the average spending for all candidates

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in those campaigns were below the limits set by the

2 expenditure limits in Vermont.

3 However, in Buckley, the last case for --

4 where this Court considered candidate expenditure

5 limits, the Court looked at the number of races

6 affected, not the average spending in all races. And

7 in Buckley, the Court looked at the expenditures in

8 U.S. Senate races and found that in previous election,

9 that 26 percent were over the mandatory expenditure

10 limits considered in Buckley, and in the House, 3

11 percent of the races had spending greater than the --

12 these limits.

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bopp, would you

14 clarify a procedural point? As I understand it, on the

15 expenditure issue, there is no final decision that has

16 gone back to the district court for further

17 proceedings.

18 MR. BOPP: Well, there were -- that is

19 correct, that there is a remand.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it may -- the district

21 court might -- may well find that nothing passes

22 constitutional muster in the end.

23 MR. BOPP: Well, they could potentially, yes.

24 However, the -- the Second Circuit did -- did make

25 decisions of law. They found that these two interests

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that the State is alleging, that is, in preventing

2 corruption and in conserving incumbent time, were

3 together a compelling governmental interest, and we --

4 we allege that they are not and that on this record,

5 this Court can determine that they are not -- they are

6 not together a compelling governmental interest.

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you arguing now then

8 that there may be no limits on expenditures?

9 MR. BOPP: Well, the -- this Court has now

10 considered, including this case, a dozen times in which

11 the government has sought to limit expenditures, either

12 of candidates or PAC's or political parties, and

13 despite the work of the most brilliant lawyers in the

14 United States, they have not come up with any

15 compelling governmental interest that this Court has

16 accepted. And we believe that this record demonstrates

17 that these claimed interests either are not compelling

18 or are not proven.

19 Now --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- when -- when you

21 make that point, that on this record the -- the claimed

22 interests are not compelling or not proven, would you

23 have us leave the door open for a greater degree of

24 proof? For example, take the -- the problem of

25 candidate time. The lower the donation limits are, the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- the more donations there have got to be, and -- and

2 there's -- there's plenty of comment, particularly in

3 some of the amicus briefs, on the amount of time that

4 political candidates generally spend scrounging around

5 for money. If we decided the case your way, would the

6 door be left open for a more impressive and compelling

7 record on this issue?

8 MR. BOPP: Well, we -- we are asserting that

9 that is not a compelling interest in and of itself, and

10 this Court should reject it. I -- I just don't see --

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you also say, on this

12 record.

13 MR. BOPP: Yes. And in addition -- well, the

14 -- the point about it not being a compelling interest I

15 think is an analytical point that doesn't have to be --

16 that doesn't rest on this -- strictly on this record.

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: So I -- I take it your point

18 then on the combined corruption/competition for money

19 problem is that there isn't any record that would

20 support it.

21 MR. BOPP: If it were a compelling interest,

22 there's no record here that is a problem in Vermont.

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right, but you're saying

24 this combination cannot be a compelling interest as a

25 matter of law, consistent with the First Amendment. Is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that correct?

2 MR. BOPP: Yes, it is. I don't see how it is

3 a compelling governmental interest to limit challengers

4 to only fund-raise to the extent that an incumbent

5 finds comfortable or convenient.

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or at least where -- where

9 the limitation -- you make a big point of this in your

10 brief as -- as I -- as I recall. At least where the

11 reason the candidate would have to spend so much time

12 is the very small contribution limit established by the

13 same statute. It's -- it's rather like the -- the

14 murderer asking for mercy because he's an orphan,

15 having killed his parents.

16 MR. BOPP: It is a self-justifying statute by

17 imposing the lowest contribution limits in -- in the

18 Nation, adjusted for inflation for 1974 dollars, when

19 the $1,000 limit was approved. This is a contribution

20 limit of $50 for an --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, to get back to

22 Justice Souter's questions, could you answer it this

23 way? Let's assume that some members of the Court

24 simply accepted the proposition that money buys access.

25 And -- and I don't think maybe we can take judicial of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that, but I -- I think that's a common sense conclusion

2 that we can reach. And you tend to fight this in your

3 brief to say that this doesn't happen. I tend to doubt

4 that. I tend to think money does buy access. What --

5 if -- if we or I were to conclude that, what would

6 follow?

7 MR. BOPP: Well, I think it's not a matter of

8 just access. It has to be a matter of privileged

9 access that this Court found in the --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Let's say it's

11 privileged access.

12 MR. BOPP: Well, if it -- if it's privileged

13 --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, isn't the answer

15 that the -- that this is up to the voters. The voters

16 can see what's going on and throw the legislator out if

17 they choose.

18 MR. BOPP: Indeed, and in fact, the -- there

19 are other less restrictive ways of -- of dealing with

20 this. For -- for instance, Vermont prohibits

21 contributions from lobbyists during the session. Other

22 legislatures have imposed a prohibition on incumbents

23 from raising any money during the time the legislative

24 session -- the legislature is in session. So there are

25 ways of dealing with the question of access that are

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 not the blunderbuss approach here.

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it is true that all

3 the polls say that there's public disaffection and

4 cynicism. Does that translate into action to defeat

5 incumbents who take particularly large sums of money?

6 Is there -- is there statistical evidence to show that?

7 MR. BOPP: I'm not aware of that. But

8 certainly the press and opponents often, you know,

9 point to examples where they believe that their

10 challenger is under too much of an influence of a

11 particular entity, and the voters, you know, in certain

12 circumstances take that into account in their voting.

13 And furthermore, it is true that there is a

14 general cynicism about politicians and government that

15 has existed since the first colonists came to our

16 country and continues today. In fact, our governmental

17 system is established on the proposition that we need

18 to limit the -- the government, and we need to have

19 checks and balances because we don't want free rein by

20 politicians because we are concerned about their

21 exercise of power.

22 But if this is enough --

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: May ask you this question,

24 Mr. Bopp? This -- in -- following up on Justice

25 Ginsburg's inquiry, is it your view that there is no

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 set of facts, no matter how scandalous and so forth and

2 so on, Watergate and all the rest of it, could ever

3 justify an expenditure limit?

4 MR. BOPP: That is not our position.

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if that's the case,

6 then why -- why would it be inappropriate to have

7 further hearings in this case to see whether they're --

8 they could be justified?

9 MR. BOPP: Because there have been legal

10 findings by the Second Circuit that we believe are

11 erroneous. The -- the first, as I mentioned

12 previously, is that -- that we do not believe that the

13 -- preserving incumbents' time through expenditure

14 limits can ever be a compelling governmental interest,

15 to limit what challengers can spend -- raise and spend

16 in their own election. I mean, this interest -- the

17 expenditure limits don't apply just to incumbents who

18 -- if there is a concern about --

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I understand. I'm just

20 curious to know what sort of -- what sort of evidence

21 could ever support an -- an expenditure limit in your

22 view, if -- if any.

23 MR. BOPP: I have a -- a very difficult time

24 justifying expenditure limits.

25 I know there's a debate on this Court on

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 whether or not there are per se situations under the

2 First Amendment. If there was ever a candidate for a

3 per se First Amendment ban on a law, surely it would be

4 this type of case. In other words, we are talking

5 about speech that is at the core of the First

6 Amendment, and secondly, we are talking about candidate

7 speech. Candidates are the ones that go into office.

8 They are the ones that are going to be exercising

9 governmental power. These low expenditure and

10 contribution limits would have the effect of making

11 candidates a bit player in their own election so that

12 the voters --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, with respect

14 to the contribution limits, what -- what makes this

15 case different from the -- the Shrink PAC case from a

16 few years ago?

17 MR. BOPP: Well, several things. First is

18 there was actually a paucity of evidence in the Shrink

19 PAC case. There was only an allegation of one PAC that

20 wanted to give one contribution to one candidate, and

21 this Court said that, you know, you didn't need a lot

22 of evidence to combat such a weak -- weak claim.

23 So secondly is the novelty and plausibility

24 of a -- adjusted for per election in 1974 dollars of a

25 $50 contribution limit, that that would actually give

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 rise to realistic concern about actual and perceived

2 corruption. So, again, in Shrink PAC --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think it --

4 you think it's the dollar amounts that are involved?

5 MR. BOPP: Well, one of the decisions that

6 the Court has to make under your jurisprudence is that

7 -- that contribution limits can only eliminate large

8 contributions that give rise to this realistic

9 perception or actuality of corruption. So it is --

10 whether it's large or not and giving rise to that

11 concern because of the size, that is an integral part

12 of the Shrink analysis.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: It -- it was pointed out in

14 -- in one of the briefs -- and I -- I didn't go back

15 and check it myself, but I'd like your comment. It was

16 pointed out in one of the briefs that the limits in

17 Vermont were substantially close to or even -- even

18 higher than the -- than the limits in the Missouri

19 scheme, out of which the Shrink litigation grew. Do

20 you know whether that is correct?

21 MR. BOPP: Well, it depends on how you -- you

22 compute it. The --

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: It always -- it always does,

24 yes.

25 (Laughter.)

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BOPP: The -- well, certainly what the --

2 what the evidence was in Shrink was it was a $1,075

3 limit, again adjusted for inflation, was about $375

4 adjusted for inflation compared to the Buckley limits,

5 and because of the paucity of evidence and the fact

6 that it wasn't really novel to say that a $1,000 limit

7 could give rise to corruption because --

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there were lower

9 limits, Mr. Bopp, and I think that's what Justice

10 Souter was asking about.

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There were the thousand

13 dollars, but I think it went down as low as $250 in --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, take the whole schedule

15 in Missouri.

16 MR. BOPP: Yes. Well, the -- the

17 contribution limits that this Court considered was the

18 $1,075 --

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There -- there was a court

20 that subsequently considered the rest and upheld the

21 contribution --

22 MR. BOPP: Yes, there was. The Eighth

23 Circuit did so and the -- the lowest limit there was

24 $275 per election, which would be $500 for -- for the

25 -- the entire election cycle. And the -- and -- but

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 really that -- that was on a -- a record that this

2 Court found to be, frankly, inadequate to -- to raise

3 any serious questions about the -- whether the amounts

4 concerned gave rise to a realistic threat of

5 corruption.

6 And the record here demonstrates that -- that

7 the -- that the only time really there is a actuality

8 or perception of corruption in Vermont is when they --

9 is when we're talking about amounts in excess of

10 $1,000. That was the prior limit.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: And we -- we didn't send it

12 back so that more of a record could be made, did we?

13 MR. BOPP: No. No.

14 And, you know, we had a 10-day trial. We had

15 numerous witnesses here. The -- Shrink had been

16 decided. I mean, there was -- everything was before

17 the court to consider the -- the matter.

18 And so, you know, they had their chance at --

19 at proof. And -- and in the numerous witnesses, they

20 made their best case. They could not identify one

21 single politician in Vermont that was -- that anyone

22 would -- would claim was corrupted in any way by a

23 contribution -- by contributions under $1,000. They

24 could not name one single incumbent politician in

25 Vermont that neglected any specific duty that he or she

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 had.

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but you know. You

3 expect them to name names? I mean, here --

4 (Laughter.)

5 MR. BOPP: Well, if --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Really, that -- that's --

7 that's a lot to ask.

8 MR. BOPP: Well -- well, they at least have

9 to give, you know, realistic circumstances. They gave

10 a few circumstances --

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose three

12 legislators had been corrupted, venal, criminal

13 corruption, actually taking no wink-wink, nod-nod, a

14 specific agreement to vote for money. So what? Does

15 that change your case?

16 MR. BOPP: Well, the -- the responsibility

17 that Shrink imposes is to -- to demonstrate both actual

18 and perceived corruption at that the --

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose that had

20 been demonstrated in -- in a particular State. Does

21 that mean, in your view, that a State can have strict

22 contribution limits and support?

23 MR. BOPP: If it's just anecdotal, no. It

24 has to be --

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. It's true. It's --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it's done. There have been criminal convictions.

2 MR. BOPP: Well, the -- if it's isolated

3 examples that are unconnected to any perception of

4 corruption at that level, then it would not be adequate

5 on -- on its -- on its -- by itself.

6 Now, of course, in Shrink, the Court cited to

7 both actual and perceived evidence of corruption at the

8 level that the -- you were considering that limit.

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, if -- if you

10 -- if you concede and -- and you tend, at least, to

11 back away from the proposition that the case I put

12 would be an inadequate ground or an adequate ground for

13 legislative limits, then I suppose you can say the

14 State has the power to prevent this from happening to

15 begin with.

16 MR. BOPP: Well, this Court has never

17 approved restrictions on fundamental First Amendment

18 values based purely upon speculation or concern about

19 something that's happening some other place. In other

20 words, these are real limits on people in Vermont, and

21 it seems to me that to approve the lowest contribution

22 limits in the Nation and these very low expenditure

23 limits, the State would have to demonstrate that

24 Vermont is the most corrupt State in the Nation. And

25 they're far from it. In fact, the opposite --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Only -- only the most

2 corruptible.

3 (Laughter.)

4 MR. BOPP: Nor corruptible. The -- the

5 evidence is quite clear. Even in the few examples that

6 they cite to like the tobacco industry passing out $40

7 checks after a -- a vote defeating a bill. Of course,

8 that's still legal under this -- this act. But, you

9 know, even pointing out that they -- that the person

10 who talked about that example made it clear that he

11 didn't believe anybody was -- was influenced by post-

12 contributions after a vote regarding a matter that's

13 not even prohibited by this -- by this act.

14 So it was -- it was a lot of testimony about

15 how truly clean Vermont is, not the most corrupt, where

16 people -- politicians would be tempted at these quite

17 low limits to, you know, sell their honor and -- and

18 personal, you know -- and their -- and affect their

19 own, you know, personal character and reputation.

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Bopp, toward the end of

21 your brief, you -- you make the argument that if we

22 accepted the State's position in this case, we

23 implicitly would have accepted the position that

24 totally -- totally publicly funded elections would be

25 constitutional. And -- and I -- I realize your -- your

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 concern there was with expenditure limits, obviously,

2 not contribution limits. You didn't come out and say

3 it, but I -- I assume your position is that that would

4 be unconstitutional per se. A totally publicly funded

5 scheme would be unconstitutional per se.

6 MR. BOPP: The key would be if it's mandated,

7 voluntary --

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

9 MR. BOPP: If it was mandated, yes, it would

10 be unconstitutional.

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and its

12 unconstitutionality would rest on the limitation on

13 expenditure, in effect?

14 MR. BOPP: Yes. Oh, yes. Well, there would

15 be a prohibition in that case if I understand your --

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, yes, yes.

17 MR. BOPP: -- on -- on contributions, and

18 there would be also a -- a mandatory expenditure limit

19 because you could only spend what the government gave

20 you. So that would have all those features.

21 Now, if it was, of course, voluntary, it

22 would solve the -- the two problems that -- that the

23 State talks about because if you have a voluntary

24 public funding system -- and this is, again, why remand

25 is -- is inappropriate. You don't need to go back and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- and determine whether or not the legislature

2 considered providing adequate public funds. I mean,

3 it's whether that alternative exists.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: But on -- on your view, if

5 -- if there were a -- a mandatory publicly funded

6 scheme and the -- the limits on expenditure were very

7 high -- it was a very generous scheme. They gave them

8 lots of money -- it would still be unconstitutional

9 because there would be -- I -- I take it on your view,

10 because there would be an elimination of any way to

11 participate by contributing. Is that correct?

12 MR. BOPP: There would be an absolute

13 prohibition, and this Court in -- in Beaumont reserved

14 that question of whether or not an absolute prohibition

15 -- and -- and then in McConnell, you struck down the

16 absolute prohibition on minors' contributing to

17 campaigns. So, yes, there would be a absolute

18 prohibition on any way for any individual to associate

19 with a campaign through a contribution.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it would also prevent

21 the candidate himself from expending his entire

22 fortune, if he wishes, in informing people of why he

23 should be elected --

24 MR. BOPP: Yes, that is true.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- think that's okay.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BOPP: And -- and in the record below,

2 plaintiff Donald Brunelle said that he was prepared to

3 spend considerable sums in support of his State Senate

4 election, which -- and considerable sums above the

5 expenditure limits that were before -- that were

6 adopted by Vermont. So the -- the question is an

7 independent --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which raises no possibility

9 of corruption.

10 MR. BOPP: Well, nor -- nor on fund raising

11 using up your time because all a wealthy person has to

12 do is write a check. And -- and, of course, in

13 Vermont, they even have an exception for not only just

14 the wealthy -- wealthy candidate, but the wealthy

15 family. So, you know --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you mean

17 they have an exception for the wealthy family.

18 MR. BOPP: Yes. To a third degree of

19 consanguinity, people who are related to you to that

20 degree are not subject to the contribution limit. So,

21 you know, it's hard to justify Vermont's scheme if

22 you're concerned about the influence of the wealthy

23 because they're giving the wealthy carte blanche to

24 fund their own campaigns, even under these limits. So

25 a wealthy person who runs for Governor -- he has no

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 fund raising costs. So -- and -- and he can get

2 contributions from others that are related by blood,

3 but not by marriage, interestingly, to -- to him. So

4 the public funding or the expenditures by -- by the

5 wealthy neither give rise to -- and both solve --

6 either don't give rise or solve the problems that they

7 claim.

8 So there's -- there's -- you don't need a

9 remand to consider that -- that question, and that is

10 one of the questions that the Second Circuit has asked

11 that -- that the matter be remanded for.

12 Now, in addition, the expenditure and

13 contribution limits here are not going to allow even

14 effective campaigns. We have considerable evidence in

15 the record that to run an effective campaign for

16 Governor in Vermont, it takes $600,000 to $800,000; for

17 the Senate --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bopp, may I ask you?

19 You keep -- the way you're discussing this case, one

20 would think that the trial court found there was an

21 evidentiary insufficiency, but I thought, at least on

22 the contributions part, the trial court found that the

23 evidence sufficed to justify those limits.

24 MR. BOPP: They did, but erroneously, and I

25 -- we believe that you have a responsibility to do an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 independent examination of the record. For instance,

2 there was a finding by the district court that these

3 amounts were, quote, suspiciously large. Now, if you

4 look at the record and you look at the six individuals

5 --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. What -- what

7 amounts were suspiciously large?

8 MR. BOPP: The contribution limits -- amounts

9 over the contribution limits for --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you -- can you point

11 to the place in the district court opinion that you're

12 referring to?

13 MR. BOPP: I am sorry. I do not have that in

14 front of me. That the district court found that the

15 amounts prohibited under the contribution limits by

16 Vermont were, quote, suspiciously large, and then they

17 cited six different witnesses. We have reviewed each

18 -- in our reply, each one of those witnesses, and it is

19 simply not true that any of them said that it was

20 suspiciously large, that is, that if there was any

21 relationship between contributions between the old

22 limits of $1,000 per election and these new, much --

23 much lower limits, if there was any -- any witness

24 related contributions of that size to any threat of

25 corruption. In fact, in the examples that are given,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 they disclaim that there was any -- that anybody was

2 bought or influenced in any way by the contributions

3 that were made.

4 Now, the -- in terms of an effective

5 campaign, of course, under Shrink if a expenditure --

6 if a contribution limit amounts to an expenditure limit

7 -- and the Court commented on this. This Court

8 commented on this in -- in Citizens Against Rent

9 Control v. Berkeley. If a contribution limit acts as

10 an expenditure limit, then it can -- it will be also be

11 struck down if the candidates cannot mount effective

12 campaigns.

13 And here we have demonstrated in the record

14 what an effective campaign amounts to, and the amounts

15 even for the House district of $2,000 would be simply

16 used up by 1 brochure, 100 yard signs, and 1 postcard

17 mailing. All of these have been valued in the record,

18 and that would amount to $1,500 to $2,000, almost the

19 entire amount allowed, not allowing even one mailing to

20 all voters in -- in that House district.

21 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

23 General Sorrell.

24 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. SORRELL

25 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS SORRELL, ET AL.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SORRELL: Mr. Chief Justice, thank you,

2 and may it please the Court:

3 Justice Kennedy, you raised the issue of

4 whether money buys access. It clearly does. Our

5 Governor admitted that in a State of the State address.

6 But we also had testimony at trial from a former

7 statewide officeholder that money, of course, buys

8 access, but on the bad days, it buys influence. And we

9 had the President --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --

11 MR. SORRELL: -- of the Senate --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you -- you

13 say in your brief -- I'm reading from page 13 -- that

14 the record convincingly shows that the ties among donor

15 groups and elected officials often determine the

16 positions officials take. Can you give me an example

17 of an official who took a position because of the ties

18 to donor groups?

19 MR. SORRELL: The -- there was testimony that

20 the President of the Senate said to another Senator who

21 was testifying at trial, we've lost the drug money.

22 I'm not willing to lose the food manufacturer money, so

23 I'm not going to sign this bill. That same President

24 of the Senate testified in a legislative hearing -- I

25 -- he admitted that he makes decisions in performing

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 his legislative duties because of that whole lot of

2 money that he had collected in the year before.

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position is

4 that that official's official positions were determined

5 by the donor groups, as you say in your brief.

6 MR. SORRELL: Influenced and --

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your brief says

8 determined. And did -- did you --

9 MR. SORRELL: Have an influence and we would

10 suggest an undue influence in some cases.

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it should say

12 influenced rather than determined.

13 MR. SORRELL: We didn't have anyone, as

14 Justice Scalia asked, who stood up and admitted to

15 having taken bribes. We did have the Senator, who was

16 the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, who said

17 that she's not in favor of tax credits, but she had a

18 donor to her campaign who had given $500 in one

19 campaign cycle and $1,000 in another cycle, and she

20 allowed a tax credit to go through her taxing

21 committee, even though substantively she didn't like

22 tax credits.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many prosecutions

24 for political corruption have you brought?

25 MR. SORRELL: We have not had any of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 legislators or statewide officers that I'm aware of.

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that

3 political corruption in Vermont is a serious problem?

4 MR. SORRELL: It is a serious problem. Over

5 70 percent of Vermonters at -- there was testimony at

6 trial from an expert that over 70 percent of Vermonters

7 believed that corporate interests and wealthy

8 individuals have an undue influence on politics in the

9 State, and I think 73 percent believe that the average

10 citizen --

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would you describe

12 your State as a clean State politically or as a corrupt

13 one?

14 MR. SORRELL: We have a real problem in

15 Vermont. We haven't had a Governor go to prison. We

16 haven't had legislators tearfully apologizing for

17 having taken bribes, facing an indictment the next day.

18 But we have got a problem in Vermont. In over 65

19 hearings before our legislature and then through a 10-

20 day trial, we established that as the trial court said,

21 the threat of corruption in Vermont is far from

22 illusory.

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: To the extent that Vermont

24 legislators can be bought off by $51?

25 (Laughter.)

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SORRELL: There's nothing in the record

2 --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's very sad.

4 (Laughter.)

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's the limit you've

6 placed on -- on contributions.

7 MR. SORRELL: I -- no.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the -- you know, if

9 -- if you accept more than $51, you're -- you're likely

10 to have your vote determined by that.

11 MR. SORRELL: No, I -- we don't suggest -- we

12 don't suggest that.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Then why -- why the $50

14 limit? It certainly isn't based on the corruption --

15 MR. SORRELL: I don't know what $50 limit you

16 are talking --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. He's thinking in --

18 he sometimes thinks in the past. He's --

19 (Laughter.)

20 JUSTICE BREYER: He's translated it into 1974

21 or '72 real dollars.

22 MR. SORRELL: Oh, it's --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: It's $200. The same

24 question or $201.

25 MR. SORRELL: It's the math.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 The reality is that these contribution limits

2 that we had -- we had examples under the old

3 contribution limits. Even Petitioner Randall admitted

4 that in Vermont, a $1,000 contribution -- if you

5 receive a $1,000 contribution in Vermont -- this is one

6 of the petitioners -- then Vermonters think that you've

7 been bought. And that's the reality --

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they can -- and

9 presumably they act accordingly at the polls. If they

10 think someone has been bought, I assume they don't

11 reelect the person.

12 MR. SORRELL: The Buckley court thought that

13 disclosure obligations and contribution limits alone

14 would be -- would suffice to address corruption and --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: But I have the same question

16 Justice Scalia had. I mean, the -- the question is you

17 -- you have limits here of $100 per election. It's

18 $200 per cycle.

19 MR. SORRELL: For a House race, yes.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: For a House. $300 for the

21 Senate, $400 for a candidate for statewide office,

22 including the Governor. That's $200 for an election

23 for Governor. You throw in contributions in kind. You

24 say that the political parties themselves cannot give

25 more than that $200 for an election for the Governor.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 If we translated those into 1974 dollars, they're just

2 the numbers Justice Scalia mentioned, and I would like

3 to know why are they -- why does not give incumbents a

4 tremendous advantage, that if you have the incumbent

5 plus a newspaper, it's hopeless, that there's no way of

6 spending as a challenger. In other words, why aren't

7 these limits far too low?

8 MR. SORRELL: Incumbents had a much more of

9 an advantage in the pre-Act 64 world. They could raise

10 more money and spend more money than --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: It's not going to help to

12 say incumbents had a bigger advantage before. That is,

13 the question is, what we're interested in is -- at

14 least what I've written that I'm interested in, is at

15 what point do these become so low that they really, as

16 a significant matter, shut off the possibility of a

17 challenge. And from that point of view, your numbers,

18 which do not tell me the expenditures in a competitive

19 district, and your numbers, which do not explain all

20 the problems that Judge Winter had with these things,

21 do not help. That's why I'm asking you the question.

22 MR. SORRELL: Vermont has the --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: I want your answer.

24 MR. SORRELL: Vermont has the second lowest

25 gubernatorial spending in the country. In the record

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it shows that in the largest urban area in the State,

2 in the Burlington area, you can buy three 30-second TV

3 ads in prime time on tier one cable for $45.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not talking about the

5 expenditure. I'm talking about the contribution

6 limits. I and my friends have the following thought.

7 We don't know who the candidates for State rep are, but

8 we want a Republican slate or we want a Democratic

9 slate. So we get all our $5 together, give them to the

10 Democratic Party or the Republican Party in Vermont,

11 and lo and behold, that party cannot give more than

12 $100 in an election to a State rep, et cetera.

13 Now, to the -- to the ear, that sounds as if

14 a challenger or a slate of challengers or a party that

15 wants to challenge is going to have a really tough

16 time. So I want you to explain it.

17 MR. SORRELL: The extensive record below

18 shows that with these contribution limits, attacking

19 the corruption and the appearance of corruption issue,

20 the candidates can amass the resources necessary to run

21 effective campaigns at all levels.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: It shows that on average.

23 It doesn't show that in the competitive races, which is

24 where the -- where the shoe pinches.

25 MR. SORRELL: The -- the reality is that --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that in virtually all classes of races, other than the

2 single-member Senate races, that average spending was

3 below these expenditure limits, and these include

4 contested cases with primaries, without.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's just what I said.

6 Your figures show that the average spending is below,

7 but that's not what's significant. What's significant

8 is what Justice Breyer posed, where -- where there is a

9 contested race and -- and some new candidate wants to

10 unseat somebody who's been in there for years. That's

11 -- that's where the shoe pinches.

12 MR. SORRELL: And, Justice Scalia, under our

13 law, the challenger can spend more than the incumbent

14 because the incumbent has a lid not -- of 85 percent or

15 90 percent of the expenditure limit, depending on

16 whether it's a legislative race or a -- or a statewide

17 race. But the -- the issue here is you're going to

18 have some -- some outliers.

19 But we have core constitutional interests in

20 trying to enhance the integrity of our campaigns. We

21 have this problem. The legislature reached a balance

22 here. It looked at what -- how much you would need to

23 run effective campaigns. It set --

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in -- in any -- or in

25 many campaigns, the -- the issues take shape during the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 process of the campaign, and there are historical

2 events, national events that suddenly occur that people

3 want to comment on. And I -- I just don't see that

4 there's any capacity for adjusting so that the public

5 can know how candidates are facing issues that are

6 beginning to emerge that the public has a vital

7 interest in.

8 My understanding was that a quarter-page ad

9 in the Burlington newspaper was, I think, $1,400. Now,

10 it's -- it's gratifying to know that Vermonters are

11 splurging on cable television, but it -- it --

12 (Laughter.)

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it seems to me that this

14 is a highly restrictive rule insofar as having the

15 campaign be able to address the issues that the voters

16 say that they've become interested in.

17 MR. SORRELL: We have the second lowest --

18 smallest legislative districts in the country, 4,000

19 citizens per single-member legislative district.

20 Sure, that's what it costs to take out an ad

21 in the Free Press, but there's nothing in the record to

22 show that House candidates, legislative candidates,

23 take out those size ads in -- in the Burlington Free

24 Press. The record is otherwise. The record reflects

25 that it's primarily door-to-door campaigning for

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 legislative races. If you're taking out an ad, it's in

2 -- it's a flyer in one of the -- the weekly papers.

3 Petitioner Donald Brunelle admitted that he ran a

4 competitive race for the House, spending $1,000, that

5 included yard signs, a mailing to his constituents, and

6 flyer advertisements in -- in the newspaper.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did he have a primary?

8 MR. SORRELL: I don't know whether he had a

9 primary or not.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's another feature of --

11 of this scheme that I find quite puzzling. You get the

12 same expenditure limit for the election cycle whether

13 you go through a primary or not. What an advantage

14 that is for the incumbent.

15 MR. SORRELL: The -- there was testimony in

16 the record that those who have a primary might actually

17 get a bump over others who are not challenged.

18 But as the district court pointed out, in

19 Vermont what makes Vermont different is that our

20 primary is late. It's the second Tuesday in September,

21 and so it's less than 8 weeks from the general

22 election. It's not like having a primary in the

23 spring.

24 And as the legislature during those 65

25 hearings considered the campaigning, they considered

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 all kinds of campaigns, including contested primaries

2 and not, and again, average spending in these campaigns

3 was, with minor exception of the single-member Senate

4 districts, of which there are three -- that average

5 spending was below these expenditure limits. So in the

6 average campaign, you could actually spend more than --

7 than on average is being spent.

8 And the issue, when you've got competing

9 constitutional interests, is whether we address our

10 problems of corruption, appearance of corruption. We

11 try to free up candidates' and public officials' time

12 from fund raising. We try to create competitive

13 elections and bring more citizens into the process

14 voting, grassroots campaigning, and standing for

15 election. We want more people to run.

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Sorrell, would you go

17 back to the -- your comment on -- on average

18 expenditures? Do we know from the record how many of

19 the -- how many of the contests, on the basis of which

20 the average was calculated, were contests in which

21 there was a -- a contested primary?

22 MR. SORRELL: We don't have that evidence in

23 the record. What we have is that we -- the experts

24 looked at total spending, which would include primary

25 spending and general election spending, and our figures

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 went from that. And our expert, by the way, considered

2 all races, even those for which campaign finance

3 reports were not filed, meaning that the candidate

4 hadn't raised or expended more than $500, and assumed

5 $500 in spending in each one of those -- each one of

6 those races. So our average spending figures actually

7 might be a little higher than -- than reality.

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any testimony or

9 evidence on the other side of the point that Judge

10 Winter makes? That is, you have someone running in a

11 primary and then faces an incumbent in the general

12 election, but there's nothing left in the till because

13 it was a hard-fought primary. That -- the advantage to

14 the incumbent in that situation was a large concern to

15 at least some of the judges on the Second Circuit.

16 MR. SORRELL: And that might be an issue that

17 on remand -- and this case is being remanded on a

18 couple of issues that aren't even before this Court.

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not on the contributions,

20 is it?

21 MR. SORRELL: No, it's not on the

22 contributions, but it is going back to the court on

23 issues of transfers of money from national parties to

24 State parties and on whether related or coordinated

25 expenditures are, indeed, allowed to be an expenditure.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 So the case is going back to the trial court on those

2 bases anyway.

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's not going back on

4 the expenditure limit.

5 MR. SORRELL: I --

6 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, the problem, I mean,

7 I was getting at and Justice Ginsburg is getting at,

8 Judge Winter got at it. The -- the problem is -- is

9 the -- the total limitation on an election cycle,

10 including the primary, when the primary involves a

11 challenge so that the challenger has an uphill fight

12 presumably to start with in the primary. And if he's

13 going to maintain an effective uphill fight in the

14 primary and he's lucky enough to win, he's going to get

15 to the general election and he's going to be broke.

16 That's -- I mean, that's -- that's the problem that

17 we're concerned with.

18 MR. SORRELL: That has not been a problem

19 that was reflected in the record either before the

20 legislature or at trial. This is a facial challenge

21 for the law, and you know, that situation of a primary

22 candidate who, for whatever reason, felt that he or she

23 needed to expend up to close to the expenditure limit

24 -- it wouldn't be very prudent, but that could be an

25 issue.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 But, you know, we do not control independent

2 expenditures under our law, and we certainly don't

3 limit volunteer services. There's a tremendous amount

4 of campaigning that can go on between a primary and a

5 general election even with a limited amount of funds

6 available.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: If the burden is on the

8 candidate to establish that -- that somebody's

9 expenditure is independent and shouldn't be counted

10 against his expenditure limit.

11 MR. SORRELL: No. There is a presumption

12 under our law --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: A presumption, which means

14 the burden, to go forward and show the opposite, is on

15 him. Right?

16 MR. SORRELL: Well, but it could be on the --

17 on the party because --

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the money that he spends

19 in overcoming that presumption is charged against his

20 expenditure. Isn't that right?

21 MR. SORRELL: No, Justice Scalia. The

22 Secretary of State reached a -- issued an opinion that

23 we -- our office agrees with, that expenditures on

24 attorneys for, you know, ballot access questions and

25 the like are not in furtherance of the candidacy and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 would not apply against the expenditure --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: The other side says the

3 opposite. I'll ask them whether that's --

4 MR. SORRELL: But the -- the Secretary of

5 State's public opinion that we, the enforcement

6 authority, agree with is to the contrary.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I ask --

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose the Vermont

9 courts could construe it more narrowly at some later

10 point. I would hate to rest the opinion on that.

11 MR. SORRELL: The -- the -- under Vermont

12 law, a presumption such -- such as this is not a burden

13 -- creates no burden of persuasion, nor does it change

14 the burden of proof.

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you know, I looked at

16 your -- the -- the references in your brief for that

17 proposition, and I did not see them borne out. You

18 referred to a -- a footnote in the district court

19 opinion which, in turn, refers to the remark of a

20 sponsor of the amendment that -- that resulted in the

21 presumption being in the law. And the only thing that

22 was attributed to the sponsor was that the presumption

23 should be regarded as rebuttable. The -- the footnote

24 in the statement did not indicate that the presumption

25 was a disappearing presumption, once the other side

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 went forward with any evidence. So I don't see, based

2 on your -- your citations, that the presumption goes

3 away simply by -- by one party going forward with

4 evidence.

5 MR. SORRELL: Well, if you -- if some entity

6 that has the burden of proof to show, in fact, that it

7 was a related or coordinated expenditure has the party

8 on the one hand and the candidate on the other saying,

9 we did not coordinate here, I didn't ask for it, I

10 didn't approve it, and then where is the evidence?

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: The -- the point is what if

12 we don't have that simple of a situation.

13 Let -- let me ask you this. Maybe we can

14 short-circuit this. I mean, do you represent as an --

15 as a statement of Vermont law that this Court should

16 decide the case on the assumption that the presumption

17 is a disappearing presumption, once evidence is offered

18 against it?

19 MR. SORRELL: Yes.

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

21 MR. SORRELL: Well, credible evidence, yes.

22 Yes.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is -- is an affidavit

24 from the candidate enough credible evidence in your

25 view?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SORRELL: Yes.

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: And thereafter, all the --

3 all the candidate has to say is in an affidavit, no, it

4 wasn't coordinated, and then the burden is on the State

5 to show that it was.

6 MR. SORRELL: If the State is the party

7 that's trying to prove that it was, in fact, a

8 coordinated expenditure, under the law -- it would

9 typically be a opposing candidate who tries to --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, the opposing candidate

11 or the State.

12 MR. SORRELL: So Justice Brandeis said that

13 there's room under our system for a courageous State to

14 experiment.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: Just can I ask a technical

16 question here?

17 MR. SORRELL: Yes.

18 JUSTICE BREYER: Just -- is -- is it the case

19 or not the case that if I contribute my car to drive

20 the candidate for Governor, let's say, between

21 Burlington and Montpelier, and I buy the gas, does that

22 count against the limit? Yes or no. I'm a volunteer

23 and I buy gas and drive him back and forth.

24 MR. SORRELL: Yes, you drive. Then the

25 answer is no.

2 MR. SORRELL: Well, but it's your car, you're

4 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not there. I lent

5 him the car.

6 (Laughter.)

7 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I got the idea. If

8 he does -- if I do, it's not.

9 What about I have a coffee -- coffee. I

10 wanted to get the line. I see it. Coffee. I want to

11 have coffee and donuts, free donuts because -- and

12 coffee for people to come in. Is that counted or not?

13 MR. SORRELL: As long as it's under $100.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. It's $200. Coffee

15 and donuts are expensive.

16 (Laughter.)

17 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay? Count it or not?

18 MR. SORRELL: We don't -- our coffee is not

19 that expensive, but --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: Donuts and coffee. In other

21 words, it counts as long as it's over $100.

22 MR. SORRELL: Yes.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: Under $100. Under $100.

24 MR. SORRELL: No. Over $100 counts.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRENDA WRIGHT

7 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

8 VERMONT PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP

9 MS. WRIGHT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11 I'd like to return to a question that Justice

12 Kennedy asked earlier about why, if there are examples

13 of corruption that the public becomes aware of, why the

14 public doesn't respond simply by voting the individual

15 out of office. And I think it's important to point out

16 that some of the most serious examples of corruption on

17 this record or of the undue influence achieved by

18 monetary concerns were not examples that ever became

19 public except in the course of the trial of this case

20 when we had witnesses come forward to testify about

21 some of their own personal experiences in the

22 legislature. By the very nature of the problem of

23 candidates becoming unduly beholden to the interests

24 that can provide the greatest sums for their campaigns,

25 those kinds of incidents are not going to typically be

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 a matter of discussion --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but I -- I thought that

3 the point was that the public mistrusts their

4 representatives because of large donations, and I

5 thought the point being made was, well, if that's the

6 case and the public sees that this fellow has gotten a

7 $10,000 donation, the public will say this -- this

8 fellow is in that -- is in that corporation's or that

9 person's pocket.

10 MS. WRIGHT: But the --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I won't vote for that

12 person. You -- you don't have to show that -- out of

13 the mouth of the candidate, that -- that he voted for

14 the bill because he got $10,000. The mere fact that

15 it's on the public record that he got $10,000, if -- if

16 what you say is correct, that -- that people are

17 worried about, the -- the corruptive effect of such

18 donations, people should logically vote against that

19 candidate who accepts so much money.

20 MS. WRIGHT: Two points on that, Your Honor.

21 First of all, the problem of holding candidates

22 accountable in that manner is greatly exacerbated when

23 you have a system of unlimited spending in which all of

24 the candidates involved feel compelled to go out and

25 raise as much as they can in order to forestall the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 possibility of being outspent. Then when a voter says,

2 well, why are you doing this, the candidate has a

3 ready-made answer. If I don't do this -- you know,

4 maybe I'd rather not, but if I don't, I'm going to be

5 bested in the fund-raising arms race. And voters

6 reluctantly have come to --

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought --

8 MS. WRIGHT: -- understand that that's --

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- when you look at

10 the -- the record, Vermont would be the last place that

11 you'd be worried about it. The political culture, as

12 we just heard, is that it's easy to go door to door,

13 and that's what the Vermonters expect. And it doesn't

14 take an arms race to get on your feet and go door to

15 door. And it seems to me that there's a real dilemma

16 on the respondents' side of the case between justifying

17 low limits by saying you don't really need money to run

18 effectively and at the same time suggesting that

19 there's a serious problem with too much money.

20 MS. WRIGHT: Well, but --

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which is it?

22 MS. WRIGHT: -- what we do have is candidates

23 -- even though it is possible to run effective

24 campaigns in Vermont for lower amounts, candidates

25 nevertheless go out and raise often much more than what

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 they need. Here's an example from the record. We had

2 Senate candidate Vincent Illuzzi. In 1998, he raised

3 $39,000, almost $40,000, for his Senate campaign. His

4 challenger was able to raise almost nothing. He only

5 spent $30,000 worth of that. Candidates don't need

6 $39,000 or $30,000 to run an effective Senate campaign,

7 but an incumbent that builds a war chest has the

8 ability to deter serious challenges.

9 JUSTICE ALITO: Could candidates --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: On your question -- the --

11 I'm sorry.

12 JUSTICE ALITO: Could candidates run

13 effective campaigns if there were no -- with these

14 contribution limits if there were no expenditure

15 limits?

16 MS. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor. The -- we

17 believe the record strongly shows that. For example,

18 there was a mayoral election in Burlington run under

19 these limits during the time that the case was --

20 JUSTICE ALITO: No. I mean, if there were no

21 expenditure limits, if candidates could expend as much

22 as they want, could they raise enough money with these

23 contribution limits --

24 MS. WRIGHT: Yes.

25 JUSTICE ALITO: -- to run effective

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 campaigns.

2 MS. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor, because this

3 Burlington mayor's race, as an example, was one in

4 which there was no limit on -- on spending, and both

5 candidates were able to raise amounts either similar to

6 what they had raised in the past or at least amounts

7 that met the campaign budget that they had sought to --

8 to follow.

9 I think in looking at the level of the

10 contribution limits, it's important again to understand

11 the scale of politics in Vermont. If we want to

12 compare them to Missouri, a $2,000 limit for a

13 gubernatorial race in Missouri was approved by this

14 Court, and in Missouri you had an election in 2000

15 where each candidate was spending $8 million or $9

16 million in a gubernatorial race. I mean, that compares

17 very directly if you --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought the --

19 MS. WRIGHT: -- did the same ratio for

20 Vermont. Pardon me?

21 JUSTICE BREYER: Wasn't it the State auditor?

22 MS. WRIGHT: Not the $8 million or $9

23 million.

24 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I know, but didn't we

25 have in front of us a limit, which I wrote was rather

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 border, that involved a State auditor campaign?

2 MS. WRIGHT: In Missouri?

3 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought so, in Shrink

4 Missouri.

5 MS. WRIGHT: It may have been the State

6 auditor, but it also the --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: Which is not quite the same

8 political volatility perhaps, but --

9 MS. WRIGHT: No, but the --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: I have a different question

11 I'd like to ask you which I haven't heard addressed

12 yet. On the expenditure limits, there is a case,

13 Buckley v. Valeo, and the Court held in that case that

14 expenditure limits are not constitutional. Now,

15 whether I agree with that or don't agree with that, am

16 I not bound by that?

17 And insofar as you try to distinguish it,

18 you've read what Judge Winter said about your efforts

19 to distinguish it. And therefore, I'd like to hear why

20 you think I'm not bound by a past precedent in an

21 important matter, with which I may or may not have

22 agreed at the time.

23 MS. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor. We believe

24 expenditure limits can be upheld without overruling

25 Buckley v. Valeo, and that's for several reasons.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 First, Buckley created a rule of exacting

2 scrutiny that applies to expenditure limits. That is

3 not a rule of automatic invalidation.

4 And very importantly, when Buckley declared

5 that the interest in deterring corruption and its

6 appearance was not adequate to support the expenditure

7 limits, that was on a record in which neither spending

8 nor contributions had been subject to meaningful limits

9 prior to the time of FECA and the amendments that the

10 Court was considering. There simply was no record to

11 show the Court of how contribution limits alone would

12 really work to address the problem of corruption and

13 the appearance of -- of corruption and encouraging

14 public confidence in government. Now --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought -- I thought what

16 that case said and what many of our other cases say,

17 with regard to expenditures in particular, is that

18 you're not talking about money here. You're talking

19 about speech. So long as all that money is going to

20 campaigning, you're talking about speech.

21 And when you say you don't need any more

22 speech than this, that's a very odd thing for -- for a

23 -- a United States Government to say. Enough speech.

24 You don't need any more than this. And that's the

25 reason the expenditure limits, as opposed to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 contribution limits, were regarded quite differently in

2 Buckley and I think should still be regarded

3 differently today. You're constraining speech. It's

4 not money you're constraining. Contribution limits,

5 you're constraining money, but when you say you can't

6 expend more than this on your campaign, you're saying,

7 no, no, no, this is enough speech. We're going to --

8 we, the State, are going to tell you how much you

9 should campaign. That's very unusual in -- in American

10 democracy.

11 MS. WRIGHT: Your Honor, I think that's

12 certainly why Buckley applied exacting scrutiny. But I

13 think what Vermont understood is that political

14 spending has inescapably a dual character. Yes,

15 campaign spending enables many forms of speech, but it

16 also has another side because higher and higher levels

17 of campaign spending result in candidates who are

18 beholden to the constituencies that can provide the

19 greatest amounts of funds for their campaigns. And

20 what you end up with, the consequence, is legislators

21 who say, you know, I've lost the drug money and I can't

22 afford to lose the food manufacturer money --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Limit the contributions.

24 MS. WRIGHT: -- so I'm not going to --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: That solves that problem.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Limit the contributions.

2 MS. WRIGHT: Well --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you want to limit

4 expenditures, even if it's the person's own money. No

5 possibility of corruption. You're saying, no, this is

6 enough speech. We don't want to hear any more from

7 you. We, the State, will tell you how much campaigning

8 is enough. That's extraordinary.

9 MS. WRIGHT: Because the -- the interests

10 that Vermont is seeking to serve are fundamental to the

11 core functions of government, preserving the quality of

12 representative government, preserving the integrity of

13 government, assuring the public that its officeholders

14 can act in the best interests of the public and make

15 decisions on the merits, not simply based on their need

16 for campaign cash.

17 And this question of accountability that's so

18 important is tied to the ability to say, I've -- I've

19 met my spending limits, I've raised all that I need to

20 -- to raise. If somebody comes to me with

21 contributions from a source that I don't feel

22 comfortable taking, I can turn that down without

23 suffering a tremendous competitive disadvantage.

24 I think one of the other key features of the

25 expenditure limits that Vermont seeks to impose here is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that they will do so much to encourage competitive

2 campaigns. We had a record in Vermont that showed that

3 for the previous nine election cycles before the act

4 was enacted, only one incumbent had been defeated for a

5 statewide office. In the meantime, in the City of

6 Albuquerque where they had spending limits for 25

7 years, every challenger who came out to challenge an

8 incumbent mayor was successful. No one can say on that

9 record that spending limits would do anything but to

10 enhance competition.

11 In the -- one of the other interests that I

12 would like to turn to, before we close, is Vermont's

13 interest in protecting the time of officeholders from

14 the burdens and distractions of fund raising. We had a

15 record in which seasoned politicians in Vermont were

16 saying that candidates for office, even in Vermont,

17 were spending as much time begging for funds as they do

18 campaigning. We had a record in which a Senator

19 reported leaving the floor of the Senate during a floor

20 debate to take a call from a donor.

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you -- how do

22 you police that, though? Because an incumbent can --

23 has so many opportunities to go before the public that

24 wouldn't necessarily be categorized as campaigning but

25 as part of his or her official duties, while everything

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 a challenger does is going to be credited against his

2 account.

3 MS. WRIGHT: Well, Your --

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may answer the

5 question.

6 MS. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor.

7 We believe that under almost any system,

8 incumbents are going to still have advantages and no

9 campaign finance system can fully address that. But we

10 believe that if the challenger now has the ability to

11 outspend the incumbent and the incumbent doesn't have

12 that additional advantage of being able to outspend the

13 challenger, as is most often the case, then competition

14 can only be enhanced.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

16 Mr. Bopp, you have 4 minutes remaining.

17 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.

18 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

19 IN NOS. 04-1528 AND 04-1530

20 MR. BOPP: Thank you.

21 The one example that they keep going back to

22 regarding the President of the Senate tells the breadth

23 of this challenge. As long as Vermont allows periodic

24 elections, incumbents are going to consider the effect

25 that their votes have on future elections. And -- and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 while it makes it more scandalous to say we will lose

2 the food manufacturers' money, what they are concerned

3 about is losing the food manufacturers' support. So as

4 -- if this the definition of corruption, it is

5 sufficient now to -- for the State of Vermont to

6 abolish elections generally.

7 Now, secondly, as to the effect on

8 challengers, the record demonstrates that challengers

9 -- and there's expert testimony to the fact that

10 challengers are more frequently challenged in primaries

11 than are incumbents, and the Randall brief on pages 16

12 and 17 point out the testimony of people who have been

13 subject to a primary and demonstrates that they are not

14 able to mount an effective campaign in the general.

15 Furthermore, the expenditure limits have the

16 perverse result of depriving challengers of more money

17 than incumbents, probably making them attractive to

18 incumbents. In the Senate, for instance, incumbents

19 would be deprived of 20 percent of their total

20 resources, while challengers would be deprived of 36

21 percent of their total resources.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand how that

23 comes. How does that come about?

24 MR. BOPP: It comes about because challengers

25 frequently in Vermont actually spend more than do

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 incumbents. I -- I know that -- that the general

2 perception is the opposite, but the general perception

3 is not true in Vermont. And -- and that points to the

4 -- the fact that the way this law is constructed

5 strongly suggests that is -- it is seeking to favor

6 incumbents.

7 Furthermore, we had expert witness testimony

8 on the effect of contribution limits on competitive

9 races. The -- we had -- Mr. McNeil testified in

10 examining the competitive races in the 1998 election

11 that the vast majority in both the House and the Senate

12 would not be able to mount an effective campaign with

13 the available resources that would have been available

14 after imposing the contribution limits. And, of

15 course, these were in the amounts of 28 percent in the

16 Senate, 22 percent in the House, which is way beyond

17 the 5.1 percent that this Court in Buckley thought that

18 could be made up by the imposition of a $1,000 limit.

19 I mean, this -- this law is so constructed

20 that it would make it virtually impossible for, for

21 instance, countywide candidates in Chittenden County, a

22 county of 150,000, the largest county in Vermont --

23 they would be limited to $4,000 for the primary and the

24 general election. That's 3 cents for each person in

25 Chittenden County. And, of course, this is an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

56

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 important county. Senator Leahy came from that county

2 as State's attorney and became the United States

3 Senator.

4 And finally, with respect to the rebuttable

5 presumption, actually the -- the statute answers the

6 question of whether or not this presumption disappears.

7 If you look at 2809, subsection (e), the last sentence

8 says, the findings and determination of the court --

9 and this is in this court proceeding by your opponent

10 that is trying to claim that this spending over here is

11 actually yours -- that the findings and the

12 determination of the court shall be prima facie

13 evidence in any proceeding brought for violation of the

14 chapter. So it doesn't go away. The rebuttable

15 presumption never goes away. And, in fact, each person

16 -- each candidate and each independent spender can look

17 at the rebuttable presumption requirement and say, I

18 have to file a report and that governs my report.

19 Thank you.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

21 The case is submitted.

22 (Whereupon, at 11:12 a.m., the case in the

23 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
