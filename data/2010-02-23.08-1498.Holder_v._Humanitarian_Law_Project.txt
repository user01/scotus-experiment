1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:09 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 4 argument first this morning in Case 08-1498, 5 Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project and the 6 cross-petition. 7 Mr. Cole. 8 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID D. COLE 9 ON BEHALF OF HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT, ET AL. 10 MR. COLE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 11 please the Court: 12 This as-applied challenge asks whether the 13 government can make it a crime for Ralph Fertig and the 14 Humanitarian Law Project to speak in association with 15 the Kurdistan Workers Party. Specifically, they seek to 16 advocate for legal reform in Congress and the UN, to 17 write and distribute articles supportive of Kurdish 18 rights, to inform the Kurds of their international human 19 rights and remedies, and to advise them on peaceful 20 conflict resolution. It is undisputed that the 21 Kurdistan Workers Party engages in a wide range of 22 lawful activities and that plaintiffs seek to support 23 only lawful ends. 24 The government has a concededly compelling 25 interest in combatting terrorism, yet it has not even
4 Alderson Reporting Company

1 tried to defend these prohibitions under strict 2 scrutiny. Instead, it rests its entire case on the 3 proposition that criminalizing plaintiffs' speech is a 4 regulation of conduct, not speech, and therefore can be 5 upheld under O'Brien. 6 That view is mistaken for two fundamental 7 reasons. First, as this Court has already held, O'Brien 8 is inapplicable where the government prohibits pure 9 speech -10 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Cole, don't you 11 agree that some of the speech could be regulated? 12 MR. COLE: Some of my clients' speech? 13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Some of the speech of your 14 client. 15 MR. COLE: I don't think -- I don't think 16 any of it could be prohibited, Your Honor, unless the 17 government can satisfy the stringent scrutiny that this 18 Court applies when Congress seeks to prohibit pure 19 speech. So, no, I don't -- I -20 JUSTICE STEVENS: You think all of the speech at 21 issue is protected? 22 MR. COLE: I think that certainly all of the 23 speech that I've just identified, which is the core -24 JUSTICE STEVENS: You identified quite a 25 bit.

Official
1 MR. COLE: Right. Yes. It's core -- and 2 I think the reason, Your Honor, is it is core political 3 speech on issues of public concern. It is advocating 4 only lawful, peaceable activities. This Court has never 5 upheld the criminal prohibition of lawful speech on 6 issues of public concern. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, could the 8 government, I assume -- I assume you will say "yes" -9 could the government forbid any NGO or other 10 organization or person from giving tsunami aid to one of 11 these organizations, from giving them money? 12 MR. COLE: I think money is different, Your 13 Honor. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could they -- could the 15 government prohibit that? 16 MR. COLE: I think money is different 17 because it's -- it's conduct, not speech. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. Let's assume the 19 government could prohibit that. Then the next question 20 is: Could the government prohibit speech instructing 21 the terrorist organization how to get the tsunami aid? 22 MR. COLE: Right. And I think -- - I think, 23 Your Honor, that the answer is no, for the -- unless the 24 government can meet the higher standard of scrutiny that 25 applies when you're regulating speech.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Brandenburg? 2 MR. COLE: Well, I don't know whether it 3 would necessarily be Brandenburg. I think for -- in 4 order to apply -- to decide this case, Your Honor, 5 all the Court has to find is that when the speech 6 advocates solely lawful, peaceable activities of the 7 sort advocated here, that's not sufficient. I think 8 specific -- we've suggested a specific intent standard, 9 which is lower than Brandenburg, would be appropriate -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but if you get 11 tsunami money, that frees up your other assets for 12 terrorist money. So why can't the government forbid 13 teaching how to get that money? 14 MR. COLE: Well, again, Your Honor, that -15 if the government -- if the connection between the 16 speech and the government's concern were sufficiently 17 close, then maybe it could. But the problem -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why can't there 19 be -20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then what's the test? 21 Is it -- you say it's not Brandenburg? 22 MR. COLE: I think the test is whether the 23 -- whether the speech -- when it's speech, I think the 24 test is whether the speech has been provided with 25 specific intent or knowledge that it will further

1 unlawful, terrorist ends of the group. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE: What if it goes -3 JUSTICE ALITO: And that applies -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it goes to 5 the mere existence of a group? Let's say you have the 6 Nazi Party, and you are talking about advice or speech on 7 some purely mundane issue. The Nazis have a hospital, 8 and you are giving them advice on how to run a 9 hospital, but the government decides that anything that 10 legitimizes the Nazi Party, you know, promotes that 11 group's terrorist activities. Can the government make 12 that kind of determination? 13 I'm thinking of something like Regan v. 14 Wald -15 MR. COLE: Right. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- where they say, 17 look, you can't travel to Cuba because we don't want to 18 do anything that legitimizes the regime. 19 MR. COLE: Right. Well, two answers. 20 Does your question refer to the Nazi Party 21 today or the Nazi Party during World War II? 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I meant during 23 World War II. 24 MR. COLE: Okay. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm just trying to find
8 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 an example that doesn't implicate the particulars of 2 the issue today. 3 MR. COLE: Right, right. So I think -- the 4 reason I ask, Your Honor, is that it may make a 5 difference if we are at war. The law of treason 6 prohibits aid -7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I didn't -- my 8 hypothetical was confusing. I didn't mean to suggest we 9 were at war. 10 MR. COLE: Okay. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I meant to hypothesize 12 a group that the government could reasonably determine 13 should not be supported in any way -14 MR. COLE: Right. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- because it 16 legitimizes it. It's going to make their hospital run 17 better. People are going to like their hospital. So 18 the party, the group, will be legitimized. 19 MR. COLE: Right. Well, I think all the 20 Court held in Regan and Zemel was that it is permissible 21 for the government to regulate conduct -- not speech -22 travel, and economic transactions, not speech. Those 23 were essentially O'Brien cases. 24 And, in fact, in Regan the Court 25 distinguished a prohibition on travel to Cuba across the
9 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 board from a prohibition directed at a group, the 2 Communist Party, in the Kent and Aptheker cases, where 3 the Court held that -4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you can't travel 5 there -- suppose you want to travel there so that you can 6 meet with and discuss lawful activities with people 7 there. If you can't get there, you can't speak. 8 MR. COLE: That's right, Your Honor. But 9 that -- but that's essentially an O'Brien situation. 10 The prohibition is on a conduct, whether it's 11 draft card burning or travel. The individual who seeks 12 to engage in that conduct says, I want to do it for 13 speech purposes. But the Court says the government has 14 a freer hand in regulating conduct than speech, and, 15 therefore, as long as you're regulating the 16 non-expressive element of the conduct, we'll apply 17 O'Brien. But what this Court has said is that when -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could the government 19 stop you from meeting anywhere with the terrorists? 20 MR. COLE: From meeting? No, I don't think 21 -22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just meeting, traveling 23 to one of these countries to actually do your teaching 24 to a terrorist -- let's say the law said you're 25 prohibited from traveling to meet any of these
10 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 individuals. How would that be different than the Cuba 2 situation? 3 MR. COLE: Well, then, if it's -- if it's 4 traveling for the purpose of association, then it would 5 be targeted at association, not at the conduct of 6 travel. The whole -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's no different 8 than the Cuba situation. 9 MR. COLE: No, but the whole point of the 10 Cuba -- the Cuba travel cases is that -- again, as this 11 Court said, it was an across-the-board ban. It did not 12 apply to different political groups. It applied to 13 anyone who sought to travel to Cuba. And it was about 14 travel. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose it's a ban 16 just for travel to meet with terrorist organizations, 17 Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical. 18 MR. COLE: Right. Well, then I think -- I 19 think that's -- that's different from this case, right, 20 because this case -- suppose it's a ban on speech 21 wherever it occurs. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what about the -- what 23 about the hypothetical? 24 MR. COLE: Right. Well, with respect to the 25 hypothetical, I think the question, Your Honor, would be
11 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 whether the government's interest in banning that travel 2 is unrelated to the associational or speech purposes. 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's what the Chief 4 Justice says: In any context, support ultimately will 5 inure to the benefit of a terrorist organization, and we 6 have a governmental interest in not allowing that. 7 MR. COLE: There's no -- there's no dispute, 8 Your Honor, that the government has a compelling interest 9 in cutting off aid to terrorism. The question is whether 10 it can do so by criminalizing pure speech. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it hasn't criminalized 12 speech. It has criminalized providing aid and 13 assistance to these organizations. Most of that aid and 14 assistance that is prohibited is not in the form of 15 speech, but it happens to include speech as well. 16 MR. COLE: Right, but, Justice Scalia -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's quite 18 different from a law that is directed explicitly at 19 speech. 20 MR. COLE: Well, I don't -- I think it's not 21 in this -- in this sense, Justice Scalia. Imagine a 22 statute that banned aid to overthrow the United States 23 Government. And it had three provisions: One, you can't 24 assassinate the president; two, you can't provide bombs and 25 weapons to groups attempting to overthrow the government;
12 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 three, you can't advocate overthrow of the government. 2 If that were applied to someone for speaking in advocacy, 3 we wouldn't say it's a regulation of speech. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not the right -5 that's not the right number three. The right number 6 three is you cannot advise and assist an organization 7 that is seeking to overthrow the government. That's 8 what is at issue here, not -9 MR. COLE: Well, but -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- not independently promoting 11 the objectives of these terrorist organizations. Your -12 your clients are free to do that. 13 MR. COLE: Well -14 JUSTICE SCALIA: But when they assist 15 the organization by providing advice, that's a different 16 matter. 17 MR. COLE: Well, the government says if 18 they -- even if they speak in conjunction with the group, 19 they -- and they're providing a benefit to the government, 20 that's prohibited. So, for example -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. When they provide a 22 benefit, right? 23 MR. COLE: So, for example, under that view, 24 the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the L.A. Times, 25 all of which published op-eds by Hamas spokespersons --
13 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Hamas is on the list -- thereby providing a benefit to 2 Hamas, working with the Hamas spokesperson, they're all 3 criminals. President Carter -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we -- we can cross 5 that bridge when we come to it. 6 MR. COLE: But -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is an as-applied 8 challenge, and we are talking about the kind of advice 9 and assistance that your clients want to give. 10 MR. COLE: Right, and, Your Honor, there's 11 no -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a New York Times 13 editorial. 14 MR. COLE: Well, it is, though. It is, Your 15 Honor. I mean, it's -- Ralph Fertig is not the New York 16 Times, and he's not President Carter, but it's the same 17 sort of support, right? President Carter -18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. No, no. I thought 19 that he was -- he wants to meet with the people. The 20 New York Times didn't meet with Hamas to tell them how 21 great their editorial was. 22 MR. COLE: No, but it's not about -- it's 23 not about whether you meet with them. It's about 24 whether you coordinate with them, and they've certainly 25 coordinated with the Hamas spokesperson in editing and
14 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 accepting and then publishing his editorial. That is -2 that would be providing a service. It would -3 JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what 4 "coordinating" means, doesn't it? And we can determine 5 that in the next case. 6 MR. COLE: Well, let me -- let me also 7 answer it this way, Justice Scalia: If you look at the 8 specific speech which our clients seek to engage in, it 9 includes writing and distributing literature in 10 conjunction with the Kurdistan Workers Party in the 11 United States advocating their support. How is that 12 different from the New York Times? 13 JUSTICE BREYER: Supposing that -- what you 14 say is you want to engage in political advocacy on 15 behalf of the Kurds. That's your words. All right. 16 Suppose -- and these are two hypotheticals. Hypothetical 17 one, your clients, let's say, or some other people, 18 know that what the Kurds' hypothetical plan is, is to 19 pretend they're a political advocacy organization, 20 but to go around shooting the people who don't agree 21 with them. Okay? Case one, the hypothetical defendant 22 knows it. In case two, he doesn't know it, but it's true. 23 MR. COLE: Well, I think -- I think if 24 you -- if you specifically intend and know that your aid 25 will further the group in its terrorist activities, then
15 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 it's not protected speech. But if you're -- if you 2 don't know that and you don't intend that, and in this 3 case -4 JUSTICE ALITO: And that goes for all forms of 5 training? No form of training or expert assistance can 6 be prohibited unless the individual specifically intends 7 to further -- that the training will be used to carry 8 out terrorist activities? 9 MR. COLE: Well, Justice Alito, this is an 10 as-applied challenge. So the question simply is whether 11 training in what international human rights consist of, 12 in how to advocate for international human rights, and 13 how to advocate politically in Congress and other bodies. 14 That's the speech that's at issue here. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, just out of curiosity, 16 I thought your position was that no form of training or 17 assistance could be prohibited -- 18 MR. COLE: No, I was just -19 JUSTICE ALITO: -- consistent with the First 20 Amendment. That's not your position? 21 MR. COLE: No. I think -- I think, again, 22 it depends upon the form of speech. There may be some forms 23 of training that are so closely connected to the -- to 24 the end that Congress seeks to -- legitimately seeks to 25 proscribe, like training in bombmaking or training in
16 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 military exercises. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: The end that Congress seeks 3 to proscribe is the existence of these terrorist 4 organizations. And the theory of the legislation is 5 that when you aid any of their enterprises you're 6 aiding the organization. Hamas, for example, gained 7 support among -- among the Palestinians by activities 8 that are perfectly lawful, perhaps running hospitals, 9 all sorts of things. 10 MR. COLE: Right. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that is what fosters the 12 terrorist organization and enables the terrorist 13 activities. Why isn't that a reasonable connection? 14 Any assistance you provide to these organizations cannot 15 be separated from assistance to their terrorist 16 activities. 17 MR. COLE: Right. Well, Your Honor, 18 that is precisely the argument that the United States 19 made to this Court in Scales. And here I'm quoting 20 from the government's brief: "Active membership can be 21 proscribed even though the activity be expended along 22 lines not otherwise illegal, since active support of any 23 kind aids the organization in achieving its own illegal 24 purposes." 25 That was with respect to an organization
17 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that Congress spent 10 years studying, made findings 2 that it was an international conspiracy directed and 3 controlled by the Soviet Union with the aim of 4 overthrowing the United States by force and violence, 5 using terrorism. And, nonetheless, this Court in Scales 6 held you've got to distinguish between that aid and 7 support and membership which is furthering the lawful 8 activities and that which is furthering the illegal 9 activities; otherwise you are penalizing the exercise of 10 lawful speech. The Court said the same thing in De 11 Jonge. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cole, as I remember, 13 Scales upheld a conviction, wasn't -14 MR. COLE: It did, Justice Ginsburg, but 15 only because it interpreted the statute to be -- to be 16 limited to specific -- to members -- active membership 17 that is specifically intended to further the illegal 18 ends of the group, precisely -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it didn't -- it was not 20 a statute which involves banning financial or other tangible 21 support, and page 17 of your brief made -- this is a 22 difficult case for me. And the second paragraph, page 23 17, you say: "The narrow focus of plaintiffs' claims in 24 this Court means that the case does not involve the 25 propriety of banning financial or other tangible
18 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 support." 2 MR. COLE: Right. 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then you say: "Nor does it 4 involve speech advocating or teaching criminal or violent 5 activity." 6 But it does involve speech, let's say arguendo, 7 that is tantamount to material support. 8 MR. COLE: Well, I -- right, but -9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the speech is 10 tantamount to material support in that it legitimizes, 11 encourages, or strengthens the organization. 12 MR. COLE: Well, two things in response to 13 that, Justice Kennedy. First, that is what the United 14 States argued in Scales. And, again, the Court, not only 15 in Scales but in a host of cases striking down 16 Communist Party statute, said you have to distinguish 17 between aid that's intended to further lawful activity 18 and aid that's intended to further illegal activity 19 when it's in the form of protected activity -20 association, here speech and association. 21 And, secondly -22 JUSTICE STEVENS: In those cases, the real 23 question was whether membership was enough, wasn't it? 24 MR. COLE: Active membership -25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.
19 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. COLE: -- which the government says 2 constitutes more than mere nominal membership. 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And this is support. It's 4 different. 5 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, in De Jonge, 6 one of these cases, one of this Court's first First 7 Amendment cases, the government argued that Mr. De Jonge 8 aided the Communist Party in its illegal ends by 9 conducting a meeting for them and being their lead 10 speaker at the meeting. And this Court said: We've got 11 to look at what he did, and what -- yes, he conducted the 12 meeting; yes, he was a member of the Communist Party; 13 yes, he solicited people to join the Communist Party. 14 But what did he do? He advocated lawful peaceable 15 activities. And this Court said -16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there wasn't a statute 17 on the books that prohibited material support -18 MR. COLE: Well, I don't think it would -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And here there is, and this 20 is in aid of that prohibition. 21 MR. COLE: Right, but Your Honor, what would 22 -- if Congress came along after the Communist Party cases 23 and said, okay, you've said we can't make it a crime to 24 criminalize membership in the Communist Party; we are 25 now going to make it a crime to speak in conjunction
20 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 with the Communist Party -- do you think the 2 decisions would have come out any differently? 3 I don't think so, because this Court has said that 4 speech is different from money, that it -5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's very 6 unrealistic to compare these terrorist organizations 7 with the Communist Party. Those cases involved 8 philosophy. The Communist Party was -- was -- was more 9 than a -- than an organization that -- that had some 10 unlawful ends. It was also a philosophy of -- of -- of 11 extreme socialism. And -- and many people subscribed to 12 that philosophy. 13 I don't think that Hamas or any of these 14 terrorist organizations represent such a philosophical 15 organization. 16 MR. COLE: Your Honor, this -- this Court 17 accepted Congress's findings. Congress's findings were 18 not that this was a philosophical debating society, but 19 that it was an international criminal conspiracy 20 directed by our enemy to overthrow us through terrorism. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: That may be, but people 22 joined it for philosophical reasons. 23 MR. COLE: Oh, sure -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: They joined it for 25 philosophical reasons. These terrorist organizations
21 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 have very practical objectives. And the only reason for 2 joining them or assisting them is to assist those 3 practical objectives. 4 MR. COLE: Well, I don't think that's -- I 5 don't think that's fair, Justice Scalia. The 6 Humanitarian Law Project has no interest in furthering 7 terrorism, but the Kurdistan Workers Party are the 8 principal representatives of the -- of the Kurds in 9 Turkey. They do have an interest in protecting the 10 rights of the Kurds. They do have an interest in 11 encouraging the Kurdistan Workers Party to -- to disavow 12 violence and engage in lawful peaceful means of 13 resolving their disputes -14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Cole -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cole, would you 16 distinguish -- I think this came up in the court of 17 appeals. There are a lot of groups on the list. I 18 think the Al-Qaeda was one instance that was mentioned, 19 and, at least according to the briefs, you conceded that 20 if you wanted to do just what you describe with respect 21 to the Kurdish group or the Tamil group, the ban would 22 be permissible, if the group -- if the group were Al-Qaeda, 23 and I'll throw in the Taliban. 24 MR. COLE: Yes. We didn't actually concede 25 that, Your Honor. That's a misstatement on the part of
22 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the government. If you look at the -2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then -- then as -3 suppose the group is not the two that we have here -4 MR. COLE: Right. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- but Al-Qaeda and 6 the Taliban? 7 MR. COLE: Right. What we said, for the 8 record, is that it would pose a very different 9 constitutional question. And I think there are two 10 reasons why it might pose a different constitutional 11 question. One is -- and that was -- I'm picking up on my 12 question back to Mr. Chief Justice, is it during wartime 13 or not? And during wartime, Congress has broader powers 14 pursuant to the treason -15 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I want to be sure I 16 understand that point. You think the issue in this case 17 would be different if we were at war? 18 MR. COLE: I think it might be different if 19 we were at war with these groups. 20 JUSTICE STEVENS: And if that's true, why 21 aren't we now at war, with regard to our opposition to 22 these organizations? 23 MR. COLE: Well -24 JUSTICE STEVENS: What is the difference, 25 as a practical matter?
23 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. COLE: Well -- well, two things, Your 2 Honor. With respect to -- it might be different if 3 you -- if you're talking about treason. Tokyo Rose, 4 for example, was engaged in speech, but she was doing so 5 with -- with the purpose of aiding the enemy and the 6 specific intent of betraying the United States. And 7 that's what's required. And what the Supreme Court has 8 said is that the -- the aid has to be to -9 JUSTICE STEVENS: But my question that I 10 want to be sure you are focusing on -11 MR. COLE: Yes. 12 JUSTICE STEVENS -- but in the issues in this 13 very case -14 MR. COLE: Right. 15 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- would they be different 16 if we were now at war? 17 MR. COLE: I think it would depend, Your 18 Honor, because the -- what -- what treason requires is 19 aid to the enemy, and aid might be in the form of speech. 20 But it also requires a specific intent to betray the 21 United States. And when you aid someone with whom we 22 are at war, there is an -- there may well be an intent 23 to betray the United States. There is no betrayal of 24 the United States here. 25 And, number two --
24 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, in a way there is. 2 What about -- what about aiding organizations that are 3 acting criminally, killing innocent civilians, with regard 4 to one of our allies? And we're seeking to gain the 5 assistance of these allies against those terrorists who 6 aim their terrorism at us, and yet -7 MR. COLE: Right. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- we -- we are supposed to 9 allow our citizens to assist the terrorist organizations 10 that are directing their violence against them? 11 MR. COLE: Well -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't that a 13 sufficiently serious reason for the government to do 14 what it's done here? 15 MR. COLE: I think the question, Your Honor, 16 is there -- is there any realistic nexus between writing 17 an op-ed, advocating before Congress, urging a group to 18 use lawful nonviolent means to resolve its disputes, and 19 killing Americans? And there just isn't. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you've 21 picked -- you've picked hypotheticals that are very easy 22 for you. What about personnel? Is there a connection 23 between providing personnel that participate in legal 24 activity on behalf of a terrorist organization, and the 25 organization can then say, well, because you are
25 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 providing this personnel, we can take them out and shift 2 them to bombmaking? 3 MR. COLE: Right. And -- and -- and I guess 4 my answer to that would be it would depend upon whether 5 the -- the -- what is being prohibited is speech. If 6 what is being prohibited is speech, I'm not sure that it 7 would be permissible for the government to say we're 8 going to criminalize your speech, even though it's 9 advocating lawful activities, because -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of the 11 things that's being prohibited here that you challenge 12 is providing personnel. 13 MR. COLE: That's right. And -- and that's 14 exactly what De Jonge was essentially charged with. And 15 the Communist Party was, again, found to be engaged in 16 criminal activity, to be a criminal syndicate, 17 essentially, by the Oregon statute. The Court didn't 18 question that. At that time it was illegal to even 19 advocate illegal activity. 20 He was charged with providing his person, 21 personnel, by conducting a meeting under the auspices of 22 the Communist Party and providing the lead speech there. 23 And the Court said, even though the argument was -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is your 25 argument limited to personnel that engages in speech, or

Our argument, Your Honor, 4 is -- again, this is an as-applied challenge with respect to 5 the particular speech that our clients seek to engage in, 6 so it would not -- it would not require the Court to 7 decide whether any nonspeech assistance could be 8 proscribed. In fact -9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When -- but the way you 10 define the speech that you want protected is speech that 11 is advocating some lawful activity. 12 MR. COLE: Right. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's unlawful 14 about teaching people medicine and how to cure people 15 from infection? 16 MR. COLE: If -- if that were what they were 17 doing, Your Honor, if it was teaching, then it would be 18 protected by the First Amendment. But if -- I took 19 Chief Justice Roberts's question -20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you see no 21 difference -- you're not advocating a difference in 22 this case between training that could reasonably be used 23 in terrorist activities, because teaching people how to 24 care for the ill could be used to teach people how to 25 care for the wounded.

And if -- certainly there would be 20 if it's -- meets Brandenburg. I think there might be if 21 it is specifically intended or known that it will further 22 terrorist activity.

It's a different 21 thing for several reasons. 22 First, remember that these are foreign 23 organizations, and as several of you have suggested, the 24 ability of Congress and of the Executive Branch to 25 regulate the relationships between Americans and foreign

1 governments or foreign organization has long been 2 acknowledged by this Court. It was acknowledged in 3 cases like Regan and Zemel and others, not only with 4 respect to nations with which we are at war, but with 5 respect to foreign nations and other entities as well -6 foreign nationals. 7 And in fact, the Petitioners' supposed First 8 Amendment claims really are not speech claims at all. 9 They are all association claims. Petitioners can do 10 whatever independent advocacy they wish. What 11 Petitioners cannot do is to provide support to a foreign 12 terrorist organization. And there, indeed, the 13 government's position is that the Association Clause 14 does not extend that far to give Americans, American 15 citizens, the ability to deal in whatever way they wish 16 with foreign nations -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it isn't-18 GENERAL KAGAN: -- or foreign organizations. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- whatever way they 20 wish.

What the statute does 12 prohibit is active support of all kinds, both 13 material -14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can they -- can they 15 advocate to the association? There are many kinds of 16 advocacy. You can advocate to the world that they are 17 right. Can you advocate to the association that you 18 should change your ways, that you should use Lexis to 19 find international law precedents, et cetera? 20 GENERAL KAGAN: Absolutely, Justice Kennedy. 21 If -- if Judge Fertig or the other Petitioners wanted to 22 say to these organizations, you should change your ways, 23 nothing in the statute -24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And suppose the 25 organization's board of directors agrees with that and

1 wants them to address the general membership on that 2 point, and they are doing it with the blessing of the 3 organization. 4 GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Kennedy, I want 5 first -- I'm going to answer your question, and I'm 6 going to say that that's still not covered, but I want 7 also to make a general point, which is that this Court 8 can exhaust all the hypotheticals that it has in this 9 case, and it will be irrelevant to the case at hand, and 10 that would be so for two reasons. 11 First, because with respect to overbreadth, 12 all of those uncertain or even unconstitutional 13 applications will be but a thimbleful, compared to the 14 ocean full of completely legitimate applications of this 15 statute. And, second, because those hypotheticals have 16 nothing to do with this case. 17 Mr. Cole said several times, I heard, this 18 is an as-applied challenge, this is an as-applied 19 challenge. And to the extent that the Court thinks that 20 there are certain categories of activity that the 21 statute could not prohibit that would raise serious 22 constitutional concerns -- which I must say I -- I 23 disagree with, but there may be some.

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, wait. They want to 2 apply. They want to do -3 GENERAL KAGAN: I'm sorry. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: They say in this case that 5 they want to provide training in the issue of 6 humanitarian international law, and they want to provide 7 training and expert advice and assistance in respect to 8 how you petition the UN. 9 Now focusing on those two things, and going 10 back to Justice Sotomayor's question, why -- what is the 11 government's interest in the following? Under O'Brien 12 or any other test, you look at it and say, does teaching 13 have a First Amendment interest -- training? Yes. And 14 what about teaching about advocacy? That's what they 15 are doing, teaching about a certain kind of advocacy. 16 Yes. Therefore there is a First Amendment interest 17 implicated, seriously. 18 Now, when that is seriously implicated, 19 there is also a government interest, on the other side, 20 in not having terrorism. But there is a less 21 restrictive alternative which they suggest, that in that 22 situation, what they're entitled to read this statute as 23 saying is that, if they believe and a person reasonably 24 would believe that their teaching, assistance, 25 training, would not significantly aid this organization

1 in its unlawful ends, then they are not guilty. 2 Now, what is the government's interest in 3 not accepting that interpretation? The First Amendment 4 is hurt; there is an interest; but there is what they 5 describe as -- and what I have narrowed -- a less 6 restrictive way of going about it. And they have to be 7 reasonable in what they think. Now, what's the 8 objection to that? 9 GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Breyer, I think the 10 objection is exactly what Justice Kennedy suggested with 11 his hypothetical, because his hypothetical is actually 12 perfectly aligned with this case. You can't give 13 tsunami aid, but the question is: Can you instruct 14 these organizations about how to get tsunami aid? 15 And then these organizations get tsunami 16 aid, and they, in fact, use that aid in such a way that 17 they also have more money to -18 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. I'm not 19 talking about tsunami aid. I am talking about the 20 instance where the teaching is itself teaching about how 21 to do something, and that something is the kind of thing 22 that the First Amendment protects. 23 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, that something, which 24 is the teaching the foreign terrorist organization how 25 to petition international bodies in order to get various
39 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 kinds of support, financial or otherwise, that will 2 strengthen those organizations in everything that they 3 do. What Congress decided -4 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine, and if a reasonable 5 person would know that, that it's going to help them, 6 then it is unlawful, if it's going to help them and a 7 reasonable person would think it was going to help them 8 in their unlawful activities. But we're not -9 GENERAL KAGAN: Congress was the reasonable 10 person here. And Congress reasonably decided that when 11 you help a terrorist -- foreign terrorist organization's 12 legal activities, you're also helping the foreign 13 terrorist organization's illegal activities. 14 Hezbollah builds bombs. Hezbollah also 15 builds homes. What Congress decided was when you help 16 Hezbollah build homes, you are also helping Hezbollah 17 build bombs. That's the entire theory behind this 18 statute, and it's a reasonable theory for exactly the 19 kinds of reasons that Justice Kennedy was suggesting by 20 that hypothetical. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: And doesn't that lead to -22 kind of logically lead to the conclusion that mere 23 membership could be prohibited? Could you explain how 24 someone could be a member of one of these organizations 25 without providing a service to the organization? Simply

1 by lending one's name as a member -- that might be 2 regarded as a service. If you attended a meeting and 3 you helped to arrange the chairs in advance or clean up 4 afterwards, you'd be providing a service to the 5 organization. 6 GENERAL KAGAN: I -- I actually don't 7 think -- I mean, Congress clearly did not mean to 8 include that. And I think that the normal words that 9 Congress used make that pretty clear. When you think 10 about personnel, when you think about training, when you 11 think about expert advice and assistance, even when you 12 think about service, you -- the notion that I am serving 13 a terrorist organization simply by the act of membership 14 I think would not be correct. And -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say Congress 16 clearly did not intend that? You know, I would have 17 guessed that you are providing a service or personnel 18 when you make yourself a member of the organization. 19 Why do you say Congress clearly did not intend it? 20 GENERAL KAGAN: That is certainly not the 21 way the government reads the statute, and that's not the 22 way the government has ever read the statute. And, 23 indeed, the government, as we discussed in our brief, 24 believes that there are certain kinds of joint 25 activities that would be allowed by the statute.

1 Now, that's not to say that Congress could 2 not have gone farther. In this specific context, where 3 one is regulating dealings with a foreign organization, 4 it's possible that Congress could have gone further. 5 But we understand the statute and -- and I think there's 6 a -- I think, quite reasonably, as providing only 7 material support, a true service, something that will 8 help the foreign organization in whatever it does. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but petitioning the 10 United Nations -- and that's what you are teaching them 11 -- does not, on its face, seem to me to be something 12 that reasonably you would think was going to aid them in 13 their unlawful objectives, but for the realm of ideas. 14 Now -15 GENERAL KAGAN: This would be -16 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and then Congress put a 17 thing in here which says: Don't construe this statute 18 in a way that will abridge First Amendment rights. So 19 it's aware of the problem of First Amendment rights. 20 GENERAL KAGAN: And I think you are exactly 21 right about that. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: And is there any evidence that 23 something like that would, in fact, but for the realm of 24 ideas, help this organization commit its terrorist acts? 25 GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Breyer, I believe
42 Alderson Reporting Company

1 that the legislative record is quite clear that Congress 2 thought that various kinds of aid given to the legal and 3 legitimate activities of the terrorist organization, in 4 fact, further the aims of the -- in fact, further the 5 illegal and illegitimate goals. 6 Congress made findings about the fungibility 7 of these resources. Congress said over and over that 8 these organizations have no firewalls, no organizational 9 firewalls -10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- but you -11 GENERAL KAGAN: -- no financial firewalls. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You say that the -- not 13 only the membership, but they can meet and they can 14 discuss. And I don't understand the line between 15 meeting with these terrorist organizations, discussing 16 things with them, and instructing them on how they can 17 pursue their goals through lawful means. 18 GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Ginsburg, I agree 19 with you that there may be some hard cases that are at 20 the borderline between the two, as there are in most 21 statutes; that there may be hard cases. This is not one 22 of them. 23 And I think it would -- it's very 24 instructive for the Court -- I'm sure you've all done 25 this -- but to actually go back and look at the

I looked at your briefs, and I thought 15 it's almost all about: This is O'Brien, this is 16 conduct, this is not speech. I didn't see the argument 17 that we've spent a lot of time talking about, which is 18 the legitimate activities allow the illegitimate 19 activities to take place. 20 GENERAL KAGAN: No, I believe we -- we have, 21 Mr. Chief Justice, although if we didn't emphasize it 22 enough, I -- I will plead error, because I think that it 23 is an -- a crucial point to this case. But I think in 24 the part of our brief -25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have -- I

It seems 8 to me your case is all about O'Brien. I'm not sure you have 9 an answer to whether or not strict scrutiny is 10 satisfied. If we disagree with you and think that some 11 of this activity is speech, I don't see the argument 12 that you've presented on strict scrutiny. 13 GENERAL KAGAN: I think that that's right, 14 Mr. Chief Justice, that we have not specifically 15 addressed the strict scrutiny argument. I think this 16 would pass a strict scrutiny standard, but I actually 17 think that to the extent that the Court thought a strict 18 scrutiny standard were appropriate, a remand might be in 19 order, that no Court has ever actually gone off on that 20 ground, that -21 JUSTICE ALITO: Why is O'Brien the correct 22 standard?

1 part of a statute which regulates material support and 2 resources of all kinds, and to the extent that what 3 you're saying is, you know, training and advice, those 4 are always speech restrictions if you find them in a 5 statute, I think that that's not right. 6 I mean, if you think about the range of 7 things that training can involve: Training how to 8 build a bomb, training how to fly a plane, training how 9 to use sophisticated communications equipment, and 10 training how to engage -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about training to -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What's involved 13 here -- I think they said that they want to train them 14 how to do lawful things, how to pursue their goals in a 15 lawful, rather than a terrorist, way. And that is 16 speech. It is not conduct. They want to engage in 17 advocacy of peaceful means of achieving the goals of 18 these groups. 19 GENERAL KAGAN: Congress, of course, allowed 20 them to engage in all the advocacy that they wish on 21 behalf of these groups. Indeed, Congress did not 22 prohibit -23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they want to 24 communicate, and you say they can communicate. And I 25 still am having trouble with the line of what they can

1 communicate and what they can't. 2 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, I think if they are 3 engaged in just discussion of ideas, this statute does 4 not prohibit that. What the statute prohibits is the 5 provision of actual support, services to the 6 organizations that the organization can use in its 7 activities, both legal and illegal. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you stick with the 9 argument made below that it's unlawful to file an amicus 10 brief? 11 GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Kennedy -12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think I'm right in 13 saying it that that was the argument below. 14 GENERAL KAGAN: Yes, I think that would 15 be a service. In other words, not an amicus brief just 16 to make sure that we understand each other. The 17 Petitioners can file amicus briefs in a case that might 18 involve the PKK or the LTTE for themselves, but to the 19 extent that a lawyer drafts an amicus brief for the PKK 20 or for the LTTE, that that's the amicus party, then that 21 indeed would be prohibited.

Now, you say, well, maybe 12 training a -- playing a harmonica is a specialized 13 activity.

What Congress did, when in response to some

You're saying that a -- a group abroad 11 which may have some American citizens in it -- let's assume 12 they do -- want to hire a lawyer. And this lawyer is supposed 13 to file some amicus briefs and do other activities. You're 14 saying Congress has forbidden that in this statute, 15 and that's constitutional? 16 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, first of all, 17 Justice Breyer, I want to sort of repeat the -- what I 18 -- what I said about the need to find a substantial amount 19 of uncertain or unconstitutional applications, or with 20 respect to any kind of facial challenge or with respect 21 to this challenge -22 JUSTICE BREYER: But I want to know if that's 23 what you're saying, what I just said: that an 24 organization has American citizens, engages in 25 terrible stuff, but they are not entitled under the
50 Alderson Reporting Company

1 Constitution to have a lawyer in the United States who 2 does legal work like filing amicus briefs. 3 GENERAL KAGAN: To the extent that there is 4 any constitutional claim that they would be entitled to 5 representation, whether it's a Sixth Amendment claim or 6 a due process claim that might exist in criminal cases, 7 that might exist in habeas cases, that might exist in 8 civil cases, then the government believes that the 9 statute should be read so as not to include that. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do these hypotheticals 11 make any difference? This is an as-applied challenge. 12 We should look to the activities that this organization 13 wants to conduct, unless -- unless you think that there 14 is an overbreadth problem. And that seems to me -- I'm 15 not even sure that the Petitioners assert that here. 16 Clearly, the -- the broad scope of this 17 statute is -- is constitutional, and whatever aspects of 18 speech it may run afoul of are -- are minimal. That 19 being the case, of what relevance are these 20 hypotheticals? It's a lot of fun, and it's very 21 interesting, but we can deal with all of that when the 22 situations arise, can't we? 23 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, I -- I do think that 24 the answer to that is yes, Justice Scalia. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The answer on the other
51 Alderson Reporting Company

1 side is: All we want to do is speak about lawful 2 activities. We're not supplying any guns, any 3 communication equipment. We just want to speak about 4 lawful activities. 5 And I go back to my failure to understand your 6 line between, yes, you can communicate with these 7 people, but you can't communicate about going about 8 their aims through peaceful means. 9 GENERAL KAGAN: No, I think my line is you 10 can communicate, but you can't provide material support. 11 You can't make a donation, whether it's tangible or 12 intangible. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. You can 14 communicate on -- I don't mean to interrupt. But you 15 can communicate on your own, but you can't communicate 16 with them? 17 GENERAL KAGAN: No -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, okay. 19 GENERAL KAGAN: -- you can communicate with -20 on your own, for sure. Independent advocacy of all kinds 21 is not touched by this statute. In addition to that -22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Justice Ginsburg's 23 question is: Can you advocate peaceful means? And let's 24 assume that if they embrace peaceful means, they get 25 more interest in their organization, the organization

1 becomes stronger for all purposes. Can you do that? 2 That was Justice Ginsburg's question. 3 GENERAL KAGAN: Can you say to an 4 organization: Look, you guys really should lay down your 5 arms. And two things -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And here's how to do it. 7 And here's how to go to the U.N., and here's how to 8 apply for aid, and here's how to file an amicus brief. 9 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, now you can't, 10 because when you tell people here's how to apply for 11 aid and here's how to represent yourself within 12 international organizations or within the U.S. Congress, 13 you've given them an extremely valuable skill that they 14 can use for all kinds of purposes, legal or illegal. 15 And it's not sufficient for the Petitioners -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you can -- you can 17 communicate, but the communications are censored. That's 18 -- you said you can meet with -- you can be a member, you 19 can attend meetings, you can discuss things, but there 20 are only -- there's a certain point at which the discussion 21 must stop, right? 22 GENERAL KAGAN: The discussion must stop 23 when you -- when you go over the line into giving 24 valuable advice, training, support to these 25 organizations. At that point --

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a sort of basic 2 question that I've had trouble with throughout the 3 whole argument? We're talking about whether this is an 4 as-applied challenge or on its face. And what the 5 district judge did was hold part of the statute 6 unconstitutional as being too vague: the words "training" 7 and "advice," et cetera. Why isn't that a facial 8 decision? 9 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, the -- both the 10 lower courts -- I think the district court and the 11 court of appeals, I think, had a kind of confused analysis 12 here, which is that they said, well, it's vague as applied. 13 The court of appeals specifically said it's not vague 14 on its face, and there is no facial vagueness claim here, 15 and yet they appeared to incorporate aspects of overbreadth 16 analysis into their as-applied claim. I think -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless you're in an 18 overbreadth situation, a vagueness challenge can be an 19 as-applied challenge. A statute can be vague as applied 20 to certain conduct, although the core conduct that it 21 covers is clearly covered. 22 GENERAL KAGAN: No, that's -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: We have cases like that. 24 GENERAL KAGAN: That's exactly right, 25 Justice Scalia, and -- and -- and with respect to the
54 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 as-applied vagueness claim, the government's position is 2 there's -- there's -- there -- it's not vague, because 3 you can go through these declarations, you can go 4 through these complaints, and you can know exactly what's 5 included within -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but I have the 7 same -8 GENERAL KAGAN: -- the statute and what's 9 not. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I had the same question as 11 Justice Stevens. It's a very odd as-applied challenge 12 because there hasn't been a prosecution. And vagueness 13 as applied, I think as Professor Cole can answer, is, it 14 seems to me, if, you know, that it applies, it isn't vague. 15 I don't understand that, but -16 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, it -17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I can't -- I can't 18 think of a case in which the Court, pre-prosecution in a 19 declaratory judgment, has said that it's improper as 20 applied to certain things. Or maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I 21 am missing some case. 22 GENERAL KAGAN: No, I -- I -- I don't think 23 you are wrong, Justice Kennedy, and especially with 24 respect to a case where all the activity is -- clearly 25 fits in one box or the other. In other words, you can

1 go through the complaints, you can go through the 2 declarations, and know exactly what is covered and what's 3 not covered. All the independent -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's -- I'm 5 not -- I'm not sure that's right. I mean, expert advice or 6 assistance -- I don't know sitting down that I could tell, 7 you know, how to advocate for peaceful, you know, 8 resolution or whatever. Is that expert advice? Is that 9 specialized knowledge? And I understand training, 10 service, personnel, but that one's a little hard to -11 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, as I said, 12 Mr. Chief Justice, there will be some hard cases, there 13 always are when it comes to applying statutes. The 14 question is never are there hard cases. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my -- my point 16 is that this -17 GENERAL KAGAN: The question is the 18 indeterminacy. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. My point is that 20 even knowing what they intend to do, it's kind of hard 21 to decide whether that's based on specialized knowledge 22 or not. 23 GENERAL KAGAN: I think it -- it actually is 24 pretty clear in this case. If you read the declarations, 25 if you read the complaints, the expertise of these
56 Alderson Reporting Company

1 parties actually shines through. Judge Fertig is proud 2 of his expertise, justifiably so. He has -3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does this -- what -4 what these plaintiffs are seeking to do -- does it have 5 any resemblance to the 150 prosecutions that you have 6 brought under this Act? It was my understanding that 7 those were for supplying weapons, supplying other 8 equipment. Are there any prosecutions that are -- that 9 aim at training to pursue the organization's aims 10 through peaceful means? 11 GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Ginsburg, I think 12 that this is not the typical case. This is, of course, 13 a case that might never have reached this Court, except 14 that it was brought as a declaratory judgment action. 15 For the most part, what the government prosecutes are 16 cases which involve a wide variety of support to foreign 17 terrorist organizations. 18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Specifically, does this 19 particular man have to be prosecuted? 20 GENERAL KAGAN: I'm sorry? 21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is this particular 22 individual in risk of being prosecuted if he makes the 23 speech to the United Nations? 24 GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Stevens, I do 25 believe that this individual can make whatever speeches
57 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 he wants at the United Nations. To the extent that he 2 is acting as a representative or as an agent of the PKK, 3 he does fall within the contours of the statute. That's 4 a different thing. 5 JUSTICE STEVENS: And is there evidence that 6 he would be prosecuted if he -7 GENERAL KAGAN: Of course, that's a 8 different thing as to how prosecutorial judgment is used 9 to decide which are the high-priority cases and which 10 are the low-priority cases. 11 JUSTICE STEVENS: But in essence, this is an 12 action to enjoin a potential prosecution against 13 somebody for making a potential speech? That's really 14 what we are fighting about, I think. 15 GENERAL KAGAN: Again, the government did 16 not bring this action. Judge Fertig and the Petitioners 17 brought this action to try to get a declaratory 18 judgment. As applied to them, the statute indeed 19 covers their various efforts or proposed activities of 20 being an agent of, of representing the PKK and the LTTE, 21 that falls within the statute and I think makes the 22 as-applied claim here not vague at all. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General. 24 Mr. Cole, we'll give you 5 minutes. 25 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID D. COLE
58 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 ON BEHALF OF HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT, ET AL. 2 MR. COLE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 3 I want to start by addressing the question 4 of strict scrutiny. The -- the -- Justice Kennedy, you 5 asked, and a number of the Justices asked, doesn't it 6 make a difference that what they've done is prohibited a 7 wide range of conduct and just some of that is speech? 8 Well, that's precisely an accurate 9 description of the breach of the peace statute in Cohen 10 v. California. It forbade breaches of peace through 11 loud noises, through horse racing in the streets, 12 through any kind of offensive conduct. But when 13 California applied that statute to the words on Mr. 14 Cohen's jacket and then argued because we are not 15 interested in the words on his jacket, we are interested 16 in preserving the peace, however it's breached, O'Brien 17 should apply, the Court said no. We deal here with the 18 conviction resting solely upon speech, not upon any 19 separately identifiable conduct. 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I agree. And that 21 was as applied to a conviction. 22 MR. COLE: That's right. 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just haven't seen an 24 as-applied challenge on declaratory relief. The 25 government doesn't seem to object to that procedure.
59 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. COLE: No. Well, the government doesn't 2 object because there are actually many cases, and FEC v. 3 Wisconsin Right to Life is only the most recent. But, 4 again, the notion is somebody who is told you can meet 5 with a group, you can discuss with a group -- in fact, 6 the House report says that you are free to speak with 7 and on behalf of a designated group. 8 But then you have a statute that says, if 9 you advocate in any coordinated way, if you tell them 10 anything that's derived from specialized knowledge, if 11 you tell them anything of specific skill, you're -12 you're engaged in a crime and you could go to jail for 13 15 years. 14 That's why the Humanitarian Law Project came 15 to me. They said: We've been doing this kind of 16 lawful activity. We think it's our right, but we're 17 not going to risk going to jail for 15 years to do 18 it. 19 The government has spent a decade arguing 20 that our clients cannot advocate for peace, cannot 21 inform about international human rights. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If O'Brien applies, what 23 remains of your case? 24 MR. COLE: If O'Brien applies, then I think 25 the Court would still be applying the scrutiny that
60 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 asks, is there a reasonable fit -- is there a reasonable 2 fit between the specific speech that's at issue here, 3 speech on issues of public concern, advocating only 4 lawful activity, and the -- and that the government 5 legitimately seeks to further, which is stopping support 6 for terrorism? Now -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That analysis of the 8 activities that you are proposing has not been done by 9 the lower courts, correct? 10 MR. COLE: Well, the lower courts struck -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They -- they haven't -12 they struck it on vagueness grounds, but none -13 MR. COLE: Right. The -14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- none of the courts 15 either subjected this to strict scrutiny or the 16 reasonable fit -17 MR. COLE: No, and, in fact, the government 18 has never even attempted to defend the statute under strict 19 scrutiny, because I think it clearly could not satisfy 20 strict scrutiny. And under this -- under Cohen, strict 21 scrutiny is what must be applied here. 22 In addition -23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why don't -- why 24 don't we remand it to the lower courts to apply strict 25 scrutiny if we agree with you that O'Brien doesn't apply
61 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 here? 2 MR. COLE: I think it would be appropriate 3 to remand for -- for application of strict scrutiny if 4 you read it that O'Brien doesn't apply. 5 O'Brien also doesn't apply if the statute is 6 not content neutral. This is a statute that doesn't bar 7 all aid; it doesn't even bar all speech. It permits 8 unlimited provision of religious materials, even if they 9 advocate jihad, but proscribes any secular material, even 10 if they are advocating peace. 11 So -- so there are -- the -- the lower 12 court, again, found that the statute was vague, that our 13 clients were reasonably chilled, that they had a right 14 to engage in this activity. I think you can reach that 15 result either through vagueness, or you can reach it by 16 applying strict scrutiny, or I think because the fit is 17 so poor here, and because -- and the vagueness, in fact, 18 undermines the fit, because people are chilled from 19 engaging even in speech that the government doesn't want 20 to prohibit. 21 All right, if I am told you -- you -- you'll 22 go to jail if you tell them anything that's derived from 23 special -24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Cole, there were 25 congressional findings that money is fungible first for
62 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 terrorist groups, like -- that if you give them money for 2 legitimate means, that it's going to be siphoned off and 3 used for illegitimate means. 4 MR. COLE: Right. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why isn't that enough, 6 either under strict scrutiny or a lesser standard, 7 reasonable fit standard, to say that you can't teach 8 these groups how to get money? 9 MR. COLE: Right. Well, one -- well, we're not 10 -- we're not teaching them how to get money. We're seeking 11 to teach them how to advocate for lawful human rights 12 or -13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, one of your -- one 14 of your stated aims, at least of one of the groups is to 15 teach them how to get aid for tsunami relief. 16 MR. COLE: Right. That -- that claim has 17 been mooted because the LTTE is no longer -- has no role 18 in Sri Lanka. So what's left is solely -- has nothing 19 to do with money. 20 Secondly, Congress only made a finding about 21 money. At the same time that it made a finding that 22 money is fungible, it said this is a statute -- and 23 this is from the House report -- only affects one's 24 contribution of financial and material resources and 25 does not prohibit speaking in concert with and on behalf

1 of designated groups. 2 Well, that suggests that Congress thought 3 that what our clients want to do is -- should be protected. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 5 MR. COLE: And we have suggested that you should, 6 therefore, interpret the statute in -- consistent with 7 that. Thank you. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 9 The case is submitted. 10 (Whereupon, at 11:13 a.m., the case in the 11 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
