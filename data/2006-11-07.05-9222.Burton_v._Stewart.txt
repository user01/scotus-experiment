1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:03 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument next in Burton versus Stewart. 5 Mr. Fisher. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. FISHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 9 and may it please the Court: 10 In Sharp versus Pain, the Ninth Circuit 11 opinion that first decided the question that's before 12 you today, the Ninth Circuit said, and I'm quoting: 13 "The rule of Blakely that the statutory maximum is the 14 maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the 15 basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict, was 16 not clear until the Blakely decision itself." The Ninth 17 Circuit is simply wrong. In this Court's Apprendi 18 decision it laid down precisely that rule. At page 483 19 of that decision this Court described the statutory 20 maximum concept as, quote, "the maximum a defendant 21 would receive if punished according to the facts 22 reflected in the jury verdict alone" -- virtually the 23 identical language. 24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Fisher, you know, 25 assuming we read it the way you read it, I've got a
3

Official
1 basic problem that doesn't really surface until you get 2 to the end of the briefs and I wonder if you would 3 comment on it at the beginning of the argument. That is 4 -- or I'll put it in the form of a question. 5 Is the decision which the judge makes here 6 to sentence consecutively rather than concurrently, a 7 decision that requires the finding of any fact about the 8 commission of the crimes themselves or the circumstances 9 of those crimes or about the defendant's character? 10 Does the judge have to make or does the 11 fact -- some fact finder have to make a finding on any 12 of those subjects -- crimes, circumstances, character of 13 the defendant? 14 MR. FISHER: Yes, he does, Justice Souter. 15 JUSTICE SOUTER: What is that fact? 16 MR. FISHER: It's precisely the same kind of 17 fact that the judge had to find in Blakely itself. 18 Under the Washington, Revised Code of Washington, the 19 statute, the statute for running sentences consecutively 20 in the fashion that Mr. Burton's were run consecutively, 21 refers the judge back to the very same provision that 22 was at issue in Blakely itself, which is the aggravating 23 factors provision of Washington, which was formerly 24 codified at section 390 and is now codified at section 25 400.

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: I thought the only fact 2 that had to be found was that, given the classification 3 sentencing scheme Washington had, there would be, in 4 effect, a free crime, no incremental punishment, unless 5 there were consecutive sentencing. That's not a fact 6 that falls within any of those categories of crime, 7 character, or circumstances. 8 MR. FISHER: That would be a fact, Justice 9 Souter, but that is not the way the Washington law 10 works. It is colloquially known as the free crime 11 aggravator. But in the Washington Supreme Court 12 decision in Hughes which is cited at the end of our 13 reply brief the Washington Supreme Court made clear that 14 to invoke that aggravator a court has to find that 15 there was extraordinarily serious culpability or 16 extraordinarily serious harm that accompanies the 17 multiple offenses. 18 JUSTICE SOUTER: So it's a misnomer to say 19 it's a mere free crime criterion? It's free crime plus 20 some further fact? 21 MR. FISHER: That's right. And this Court's 22 decision -- I'm sorry. The Washington Supreme Court 23 decision in Hughes clearly lays that out. If you have 24 any doubt about the way the consecutive sentences work 25 in Washington, I want to give you one other citation, to
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 a new Washington Court of Appeals decision that 2 considers a consecutive sentences imposed exactly the same 3 way that Mr. Burton's was. That is to say, they are run 4 consecutively based on the clearly too lenient factor. 5 That case is called State versus Washington and it was 6 just reported at 143 P.3d 606, 143 P.3d 606. The 7 Washington Court of Appeals in that case, considering a 8 sentence just like Mr. Burton's, says that it does 9 trigger and violate Blakely. 10 JUSTICE SOUTER: So the extra fact then is a 11 lot like the sort of heinous, atrocious and cruel 12 aggravator? I mean, it's comparable to it? 13 MR. FISHER: Exactly, it's part of the same 14 list. And as this Court said in Apprendi itself, that 15 extra culpability, which is one of the ways this 16 aggravator can be met, is the quintessential type of 17 element that needs to be proven beyond a reasonable 18 doubt . 19 JUSTICE BREYER: When you say extra 20 culpability, do you mean the nature of the crime? 21 Suppose there are three crimes all committed at the same 22 time -- murder, rape, and kidnapping. 23 They're all very serious crimes. And if you 24 sentence them consecutively, you will take into account 25 that there were three. If you sentence them
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 concurrently, it doesn't matter. The Washington court 2 says, we're not just looking to the fact that murder or 3 rape or kidnapping are serious; we're looking to 4 sentence consecutively if do you more than that. You 5 have to look to see that the kidnapping was a special 6 kind of kidnapping. 7 MR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Breyer. 8 In section -- the current section is section 589 of 9 the Washington Code and it says that sentences shall run 10 concurrently unless the judge makes an extra finding of 11 exactly the same type the judge is required to find in 12 Blakely. And if you look at Blakely itself, remember 13 Blakely involved concurrent sentences. And so what Washington 14 is doing is saying all sentences should run concurrently 15 unless there's an extra fact, something about the 16 additional crimes that would otherwise be running 17 concurrently, that simply requires the judge to go above 18 and beyond the ordinary concurrent sentences and punish 19 those crimes separately. 20 JUSTICE SOUTER: But could the nature of the 21 additional crimes themselves satisfy it? In other 22 words, could the judge say, well, all three -- it might 23 be one thing if one were serious and the other two were 24 trivial, but all of these three are very serious. Now, 25 that's in effect a value judgment, not a finding of
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 discrete fact. Could that value judgment satisfy the 2 extraordinary criterion that Washington says there must 3 be in addition to free crime. 4 MR. FISHER: No, it couldn't, and the 5 Washington decision that I've cited to you will help you 6 with this, because it makes it clear that to trigger an 7 aggravator to run sentences concurrently, just as under 8 Blakely itself, there has to be something above and 9 beyond the elements of the crime or the crimes 10 themselves. It can't simply be -- I'm sorry. It can't 11 simply be that there were three crimes committed 12 and all three of them are very serious. 13 It has to be something about the crime, the additional 14 crimes, that takes it above and beyond the ordinary 15 commission of that crime. 16 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Fisher, even if 17 it's true that there are other examples out there that 18 might qualify for that example, it's not true of this 19 case? 20 MR. FISHER: I'm not sure I follow, Justice 21 Stevens. 22 JUSTICE STEVENS: In this particular case, 23 there was -- it was necessary to make an additional 24 finding of fact, even though there may be cases out 25 there in which you could get consecutive sentences
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 without an additional finding of fact? 2 MR. FISHER: You're certainly right that in 3 this case you needed to have an extra finding of fact. 4 There are some situations under the Washington Code and 5 I believe in the majority of other States where it is up 6 to the judge's discretion whether to run sentences 7 concurrently, and he could do it for the reason that 8 Justice Souter described. So what Washington does in 9 its respondent's brief is it cites these other State 10 decisions, from other States that simply have different 11 sentencing systems than we have in Washington. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure I 13 understand that. I mean, we have not held, for example, 14 that the fact of a prior conviction is something that 15 has to be submitted to a jury under Blakely. Why, if 16 you're determining that sentences run consecutively, 17 isn't that just the same as looking at a simultaneous 18 conviction and saying they're going to run 19 consecutively? 20 MR. FISHER: Under some State systems that 21 might be the case, Mr. Chief Justice. However, in 22 Washington the way that the code works is that judges 23 are directed that for multiple crimes the sentences 24 shall run consecutively. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you'd have --
9

1 MR. FISHER: Unless they make the exact kind 2 of extra finding, and it refers them to the precise same 3 statute that was at issue in Blakely itself. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you're saying 5 that that extra finding can't simply be that this is a 6 conviction for a particular serious crime that's going 7 to go unpunished otherwise? 8 MR. FISHER: That's right. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So under this system 10 if you had a regime where if you're convicted of murder 11 and you've been convicted of rape before that, you get 12 an enhanced sentence beyond the normal murder sentence, 13 that would not contravene Blakely. But if you're 14 convicted at the same time for rape and murder and those 15 two sentences run consecutively, you say that that does 16 violate Blakely. 17 MR. FISHER: If the judge needs to make an 18 extra finding beyond the elements of either of those two 19 crimes to run them consecutively, then it would violate 20 Blakely. 21 THE COURT: But we've never held that? 22 We've never held that consecutive -- that the treatment 23 of sentences as concurrent or consecutive is covered by 24 Blakely? 25 MR. FISHER: You haven't had a case in the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Apprendi-Blakely line of cases dealing with consecutive 2 sentences. But what you've done is laid down a rule 3 from the very State that we're dealing with here that 4 says that if the judge needs to make an extra finding 5 beyond the elements of the crimes of conviction and 6 beyond the facts encompassed in the jury's finding of 7 guilt for those crimes, then those findings need to be 8 proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. That's why 9 in this case that line, that rule, is triggered. 10 The Ninth Circuit of course didn't talk 11 about any of this. What it said, as I mentioned, is 12 that it simply took Apprendi to be a purely formalistic 13 rule that had nothing to do with the facts according to 14 the jury verdict, but it just had to do with whatever 15 the State happened to label as the statutory maximum. 16 In Apprendi this Court said, not once but three times, 17 that the statutory maximum concept was triggered 18 according to the facts encompassed in the jury verdict. 19 And like the Washington courts, the Ninth Circuit simply 20 ignored that language in this Court's opinion. 21 Lest there be any doubt about the way that 22 concept mapped onto this case, this Court said in Apprendi 23 itself that the relevant inquiry was not one of form but 24 one of effect: Does the required finding take a 25 defendant to a higher sentence level than would
11

1 otherwise be permissible based on the facts encompassed 2 in the jury verdict? 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher, there's 4 another potential impediment in this case and I would 5 like you to comment on it. That is the petition from 6 the sentence, it was second in time. There was a prior 7 petition that challenged just the conviction, and under 8 the governing statute, to have a second petition, you've 9 got to get permission from the court of appeals and it 10 has to meet stringent criteria. 11 How do you get past that? You went out 12 concentrating on the petition addressed to the sentence 13 which is a second petition. 14 MR. FISHER: This is the very first petition 15 that Mr. Burton has filed against the 1998 judgment. He 16 did file earlier a petition against the original 17 judgment of 1994. In the joint appendix at page 34, 18 that is where that petition is reprinted. He says quite 19 clearly that he is challenging the 1994 judgment in that 20 petition, whereas here this is his first petition 21 against the 1998 judgment. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So did -- then you are 23 bifurcating the judgment in a criminal case, which is 24 not the sentence. You are saying there's an earlier 25 judgment, and looking at it as we would as if it were a
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 civil case, if you have a determination of liability, 2 that doesn't give you a final judgment. The judgment 3 will come at the end of the case when damages are 4 determined. 5 MR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Ginsburg. 6 And if what the State is saying is correct, which is to 7 say that we don't have any judgment at all until the 8 sentence is final, then all you get from that is that 9 Mr. Burton's first petition should have been dismissed 10 and the court could have gotten it dismissed. But we 11 submit what you can't do from that is retroactively 12 change the first petition that he explicitly told the 13 court was against the 1994 judgment, and that he told 14 the court in that same filing on JA 35 and JA 40, that 15 his sentence was still on direct review. You can't 16 retroactively change that challenge to the 1994 judgment 17 into one against the 1998 judgment, for two reasons. 18 One is that if the State is right, the 19 district court wouldn't have had jurisdiction under that 20 1998 -- challenge against the 1998 judgment either, 21 because as Mr. Burton forthrightly told the court, that 22 sentence was still on direct review. But even if you 23 get past that, we submit that this Court's Castro 24 decision simply doesn't allow a court, especially 25 retroactively, to recharacterize a habeas petition that
13
Alderson Reporting Company

1 the petitioner himself said was against one judgment as 2 against another. 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you think there can 4 always be two petitions, one -- of sentences on review? 5 MR. FISHER: No, there can't, Justice 6 Kennedy. And so what should have happened according to 7 the state's theory, is that the first petition should, 8 should simply have been dismissed. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Bit is that also your 10 theory? 11 MR. FISHER: I think that's -- this Court 12 hasn't laid down a solid decision. But I think that's a 13 better reading. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But are you -- are you 15 asking us to say that while the sentence is still under 16 review, there can be no habeas petition filing? 17 MR. FISHER: Am I asking -18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't that up to the 19 option of the petitioner? He can take his chances or he 20 can wait. 21 MR. FISHER: I think that is a fair 22 characterization, Justice Kennedy. But what Mr. Burton 23 did is he want to the district court saying I'm 24 challenging the 1994 judgment. And as I was saying, 25 under Castro before that gets recharacterized --
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking if it is your 2 position whether or not he properly can do that? 3 MR. FISHER: I don't think so. But I'm just 4 recognizing that that's a jurisdictional question that 5 this Court would decide for itself. But assuming that 6 he can't do that, what the district court would have had 7 to say is, Mr. Burton, you're not allowed to challenge 8 the 1994 judgment. And let's assume for the moment he 9 could have challenged the 1998 judgment. The district 10 judge would have said, "Now Mr. Burton, you're only 11 challenging your conviction for the 1994 judgment. You 12 need to wait until you're ready to challenge your 13 sentence, and then you can challenge the 1998 judgment." 14 Presumably -- and this is I think a fair inference 15 especially from the petition itself as it is reprinted, 16 since he told the district court that he was challenging 17 his sentence, if he was told he couldn't bring it at 18 that time he would have said okay, I will withdraw it 19 and wait until I can challenge my sentence. 20 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if the first proceeding 21 was not in fact jurisdictionally barred, then you would 22 lose under the second and successive objection in this 23 case, right? 24 MR. FISHER: I don't know that we would, 25 Justice Souter.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why not? 2 MR. FISHER: Because it is a common rule 3 that -- this Court hasn't had a case exactly like this, 4 but the lower courts do all the time; and the Fourth 5 Circuit case in Taylor which I've cited in the reply 6 brief is one of them. Where, it is a common practice 7 for a petitioner to bring one petition against a 8 judgment and then be partially successful, and then 9 bring a new petition against something in the new 10 judgment. And that's essentially what happened here. 11 And it may -12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't those cases in which 13 the first judgment is complete, he simply does not 14 attack everything that was a predicate for the first 15 judgment; and then if there is, in fact, a new trial, 16 and a new judgment, of course, the habeas possibility 17 arises again, whereas in this case, the first judgment 18 was not complete. 19 MR. FISHER: No, you put your finger on it 20 exactly. And so, but we still think that, that, either 21 the court had jurisdiction or it didn't. And if it had 22 jurisdiction, then it must be -- fall in somehow into 23 the category that you're talking about. 24 JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's not necessarily 25 true. Isn't it also possible if, at the time of the
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 first judgment the judge could have said, well you really 2 haven't exhausted your remedies because it is not final 3 until the whole thing is over. But nevertheless, 4 because exhaustion is not a jurisdictional matter, I'm 5 going to go ahead and decide it. 6 MR. FISHER: Could a district judge have 7 done that? 8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 9 MR. FISHER: I think what would have needed 10 to have happened here, since Mr. Burton at pages 35 and 11 40 of the joint appendix, told the district judge, I'm 12 still challenging my sentence on direct appeal, under 13 AEDPA and customary comity principles, the judge would 14 have needed to say, you need either to renounce that 15 appeal from the State court or renounce this one. You 16 couldn't do both at the same time. 17 Mr. Burton, if he had wanted to, I think it 18 is fair to say, could have gone into district court and 19 said, I now have a new judgment and I'm going to 20 challenge my conviction and sentence because I have no 21 intention of challenging my sentence through State court 22 proceedings. And perhaps he could have done that. But 23 that would be a very different situation than what we 24 have here. 25 If I can turn back to the, not a new rule
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 question, another angle at this is not simply to look at 2 the text of this Court's opinion in Apprendi which we 3 submit told a State court in this situation all it would 4 have needed to know, but also perhaps it is helpful to 5 look behind that and look at the statutes that were in 6 play in New Jersey and in Washington. And even if you 7 did that it becomes, we submit, very clear that a 8 district judge, any reasonable trial judge, that is, 9 would have known that Apprendi applied here. 10 What you had in New Jersey was essentially 11 two statutes. One that said an ordinary commission of a 12 crime is punishable up to 10 years. And a second 13 statute that said if you commit that crime with some 14 kind of extra -- extra bad circumstance, there a hate 15 crime, then you get -- you can get a higher sentence. 16 Exactly the same thing was true in 17 Washington. We had one statute that said this is what 18 the, this is what the punishment is for the ordinary 19 commission of this crime. And we had an extra statute 20 that said, but if you commit that crime with extra bad 21 circumstances -- and here the only difference was, there 22 was a list of circumstances, not just a single one -23 but if you commit the crime with extra circumstances, 24 then you can get extra punishment. 25 And the analogy that the respondents want to
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 draw between the Washington sentencing system and the 2 Federal guidelines just simply doesn't hold up. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think Blakely 4 was not a new rule but Booker was? 5 MR. FISHER: I think that's fair to say, 6 Mr. Chief Justice. Because in Blakely all you needed to 7 do was apply Apprendi which said that if you have two 8 different statutory thresholds, the pertinent threshold 9 for Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment purposes is 10 the one that cabins the judge's discretion based on the 11 facts in the jury verdict. To decide Booker this Court 12 had to take the term statutory maximum and apply that to 13 a different type of threshold, which was as this Court 14 put it a court rule or a quasi legislative enactment. 15 So under -- under the system that this Court 16 reviewed in Booker, you had only a single true statutory 17 maximum. And then you had to decide whether the 18 Apprendi principle ought to be in play for the Federal 19 sentencing guidelines. And if there is any confusion on 20 that, a trial judge could have looked at Apprendi itself 21 where this Court and Justice Thomas's concurrence made 22 clear that there was unique status of the Federal 23 sentencing guidelines that made it a more difficult 24 question. 25 However, here where you didn't have anything
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 like that, we had just a simple situation where there 2 were two statutes, one maximum for the ordinary crime, 3 and then an additional maximum for the crime being 4 committed with aggravating circumstances. And so it was 5 a very clear map line. And that's what this Court said 6 in Blakely, of course. It said, it didn't break any new 7 ground in the decision in Blakely. It simply said that, 8 took the state's argument and rejected it by saying our 9 precedents on this point are clear. And it just simply 10 quoted the Apprendi language, that the statutory maximum 11 for Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment purposes is the 12 maximum that a defendant may receive based on the facts 13 and the jury verdict alone. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There were decisions 15 going the other way. 16 MR. FISHER: There were lower court 17 decisions? 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 19 MR. FISHER: Yes, there were. And I think, 20 if we want to talk about these, it is important first to 21 be clear about what we are talking about. There were, 22 there was a Supreme Court of Kansas that had looked to 23 the relevant language in Apprendi and decided that its 24 sentencing guidelines system could not stand. And then 25 you had, on the other side the Supreme Court of
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Washington, and the Supreme Court of Oregon, and a 2 couple of other State intermediate courts, I think some 3 in unpublished decisions, that had gone the other way. 4 But I think it is very telling, Justice 5 Ginsburg, if you want to look at those State supreme -6 I'm sorry, those State supreme court and lower court 7 decisions, because none of them -- not a single one -8 quotes Apprendi or even acknowledges the passages in 9 Apprendi that said the test is not one of form but of 10 effect. And there's several passages in Apprendi that 11 said that the statutory maximum was the maximum allowed 12 based on the facts in the jury verdict. So once you 13 take those into account, we submit, as the Kansas 14 Supreme Court realized, there is only one conclusion 15 that you can reach. The only way those lower courts 16 were able to come to a contrary decision was simply to 17 pluck out -- pluck out other sentences of Apprendi and 18 not acknowledge the rest of the opinion. And of course, 19 the rest of the opinion where this Court has these 20 passages, pages 483, 482, are the absolute guts, the 21 building blocks of the opinion itself. It is where the 22 Court canvasses the historical rule that was 23 incorporated into our constitutional system. And so it 24 is not as though that is some sort of dicta that or 25 loose language that this Court had in its opinion. It
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 was the very guts of the holding of Apprendi. 2 And we submit that, in a Teague analysis 3 where you are indeed supposed to look to whether a 4 reasonable jurist would have found something, not just 5 the fact that they exist, but whether a reasonable 6 jurist would have reached a given conclusion, once you 7 take the whole of Apprendi into account, there was only 8 one conclusion that a reasonable jurist could have come 9 to. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose that doesn't 11 make the dissenters in Blakely feel very good. 12 MR. FISHER: Well, Justice Kennedy, I think, 13 as I understand the dissents in, in Blakely, the 14 dissents in Blakely primarily were saying that Apprendi 15 itself was a bad idea. And that Apprendi really wasn't 16 dictated by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. I see 17 almost nothing, in fact really nothing in the dissents 18 of Blakely itself that says taking Apprendi as the law, 19 we can distinguish it from the facts in this case. 20 There was nothing of that in the dissents. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course you have to show 22 that the result was dictated by the prior precedent. 23 That's a strong phrase. We said it in Stringer -24 Stringer versus Black. But if it has a new application, 25 that's -- that's new. Even though the principle is the
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 same. 2 MR. FISHER: I think the Stringer test is 3 helpful because there, of course, this Court said that 4 one of its prior decisions was not a new rule, because 5 even though there was a different State sentencing 6 system that slightly different before the Court in the 7 subsequent case, the principle from the prior case 8 dictated only one result. And I think once you go back 9 to the dissents in Blakely and compare them let's say, 10 with the dissents in Booker, on the merits that is, in 11 Booker, I think again it is telling, because the 12 dissenters in Blakely had nothing to say in terms of a 13 possible way to distinguish one case from the other; 14 whereas in Booker, the dissents did point out we don't 15 have to extend it this far. We can limit to it to true 16 statutes and not go this far. So there is a difference. 17 Really what this case, I think one way to 18 phrase it in terms of what it comes down to, is whether 19 when this Court lays a decision down like Apprendi, that 20 has a clear rule and lots of historical, robust 21 reasoning behind it, saying why we are adopting a 22 certain rule, whether it is up to the lower courts, in 23 this case the State courts, to second-guess this Court 24 and say I don't know if the Court really means what it 25 says, as Justice Breyer later put it in the Blakely

1 dissent. 2 We think that, we submit what this Court 3 should say is that when we say something is the law, 4 that lower courts ought to assume that's the law, at 5 least until we tell them somehow that the law is 6 different. 7 If there are no more questions on the new 8 rule, I will quickly address the watershed argument. 9 Because if for some reason this Court adopted the 10 state's view that really all Apprendi was was a highly 11 formalistic rule about what is a statutory maximum, and 12 that -- and that just simply labeling, courts could have 13 evaded it, we think that Blakely itself then has to be 14 considered a watershed exception -- a watershed rule. 15 And the reason why is because, is because of an error 16 that runs throughout the state's brief. 17 And the state's position is basically that 18 this can't be watershed because Apprendi and Blakely 19 deal with circumstances where a defendant has already 20 been convicted of a crime and all we're considering is 21 what sentence ought to be imposed. But, of course, that 22 -- that contravenes the very holding of Apprendi and 23 Blakely which is to remedy the fact that the defendant 24 is being sentenced for a greater crime than the jury 25 actually found him guilty of. And --

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This argument, this 2 argument assumes that we rule against you on whether or 3 not it is a new rule. 4 MR. FISHER: I think that's right, Mr. Chief 5 Justice. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't you have -7 don't you have to address AEDPA before we get to that 8 question? 9 MR. FISHER: In the watershed realm? 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, it 11 doesn't matter it it's a watershed, I guess it is a 12 point of argument, but it is not clear that it matters 13 whether it is a watershed rule if you read AEDPA 14 2254(d)(1) by its terms. 15 MR. FISHER: If this Court concluded in the 16 Whorton case that watershed did not survive AEDPA, then 17 of course you're right, watershed doesn't -- can't get 18 us home here. But as this case comes to the Court, as I 19 understand it, this Court is considering this case in a 20 posture that it really dealt with in Horn versus Banks 21 where it said that even post AEDPA, what a court is 22 supposed to do is conduct what this Court termed a 23 threshold Teague inquiry as to whether Teague is 24 satisfied. And of course in Horn, this Court mentioned 25 the watershed exception itself.

1 So we think that what this Court should 2 really do is address that threshold question to the 3 extent it needs to holistically. 4 If there are no more questions, I'll reserve 5 the remainder of my time. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 7 Mr. Fisher. 8 Mr. Collins. 9 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. COLLINS 10 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 11 MR. COLLINS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 12 please the Court: 13 I would like to begin where Justice Ginsburg 14 began, with the issue of successive petitions. We 15 believe that the petition before this Court is a 16 successive petition barred under AEDPA. Now my brother, 17 Mr. Fisher says that it's not a successive petition 18 because the first petition challenged the 1994 judgment. 19 But that is simply not correct as a matter of the facts 20 of this case. 21 A new judgment was entered in March of 1998. 22 That judgment was entered as a result of Mr. Burton's 23 conviction being affirmed and his sentence being 24 reversed. So when he was in custody, when he filed his 25 first petition, he was in custody pursuant to that
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 amended judgment. 2 JUSTICE SOUTER: So that is the only 3 judgment that could be attacked on habeas? 4 MR. COLLINS: Exactly, Your Honor. So he 5 has an amended judgment filed in March of 1998. He 6 files his first petition challenging his conviction 7 under that petition. Later, in 2002, he files a second 8 petition challenging his sentence. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't matter -10 I'm looking at joint appendix page 34, date of judgment 11 of conviction, he puts in December 16, 1994. 12 MR. COLLINS: He does put that in, Your 13 Honor, but I don't think that's determinative. If you 14 take a look at page 35, on question 8, they say, did you 15 appeal from the judgment of conviction? Answer, yes. 16 If you did appeal, answer the following. And it lays 17 out the facts that he appealed, that his conviction was 18 affirmed, that his sentence was reversed, and then a new 19 judgment is entered in March of 1998. 20 He is not in custody pursuant to the 1994 21 judgment. He is in custody -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where does it say a 23 new judgment was issued in March of '98? 24 MR. COLLINS: Your Honor, that's in the 25 joint appendix at page 3, which shows that --
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I thought you 2 meant it was in his petition. 3 MR. COLLINS: No, no, it wasn't in his 4 petition, Your Honor, but it doesn't seem -- the fact 5 that he was looking back at his conviction, original 6 conviction being 1994, and that's what he wrote down, 7 doesn't mean that that was the conviction and that was 8 the judgment under which he was in custody, because it 9 simply wasn't. The original 1994 judgment no longer 10 existed because a new judgment had been entered. So 11 because -- and I don't think -- I think what we disagree 12 about in this is which judgment, if the first petition 13 went to the first -- to the 1994 judgment, and the 14 second petition went to the 1998 judgment, then we would 15 agree with Mr. Fisher that it is not successive. 16 On the other hand, I believe I heard him say 17 that if you agree with us, that the only judgment in 18 existence at the time he filed his petition was the 1998 19 judgment. Then he's filed a successive petition with 20 regard to that judgment, one in December of 1998 dealing 21 with the conviction; a second in 2002, dealing with the 22 sentence. 23 So since it's a successive petition and 24 Mr. Burton did not go through the gatekeeping function 25 that AEDPA requires, there is no -- the district court
28

1 had no jurisdiction and subsequently, we believe that 2 this Court does not have jurisdiction. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: The fact is, we're looking 4 at page 34, 34 of the joint appendix, and that is the 5 first petition that was filed; is that right? 6 MR. COLLINS: That's correct, Your Honor. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: So you look at it and it 8 says, filed December 28, and maybe this is what you 9 said. Then it says date of judgment of conviction, 10 December 16, 1994. So looking at that, you'd think that 11 is what he was attacking. Where does it say he's 12 attacking anything else? 13 MR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor, it doesn't 14 say he's attacking anything else, but the problem with 15 that is that when he filed this petition, he was not 16 being confined -17 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I imagine there 18 are tens of thousands off petitions filed in the Federal 19 system. And I would think that judges when they're 20 trying to look at those petitions, or the magistrate 21 looks at them and says what judgment are you attacking, 22 he has to figure that out often for statute of 23 limitations purposes, or some other purpose. He'd look 24 over there, go down and read that line two, and he'd 25 think yeah, that's the judgment that's being attacked,

1 unless of course there's some indication that it's 2 something else. 3 I've never heard of this before. Is there 4 any precedent on that where even though the petition 5 refers to date A, and there's nothing in to suggest 6 anything other than date A, because it turns out that 7 there's a different judgment that in fact, he's being 8 held, which is date B, that the court says oh, you're 9 attacking date B. 10 Is there any precedent that says that's how 11 it's read? 12 MR. COLLINS: I'm not aware of any 13 precedent. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: No. So this might be the 15 first time. I don't see a reason why you wouldn't read 16 the petition that's filed in an ordinary way and say the 17 judgment that's being attacked is the judgment that it 18 refers to. 19 MR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor, I think you 20 have to say the judgment that's being attacked is the 21 judgment by which he's being confined. I mean, he -22 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know what 23 implication this is going to have for a lot of these 24 petitions. I don't know one way or the other, but it 25 might be there are thousands right now in the Federal

1 court which have date A, and somebody is going to go 2 back and say no, it is really date B or something. I'm 3 a little nervous about it. If you're not nervous, 4 you're the ones in charge. 5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Mr. Collins, isn't it 6 your position that, number one, the only judgment that he 7 can attack on habeas is the judgment that is extant at the 8 time of the habeas proceeding, and that is the '92 9 judgment that follows the resentencing? But he may in 10 attacking that judgment attack the premise of conviction 11 which occurred earlier? 12 MR. COLLINS: Exactly, Your Honor. 13 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if he chooses to attack 14 only the earlier conviction which is the premise of the 15 later judgment, he has simply in effect waived any other 16 issue. And when he comes in later and tries to raise 17 the issue that he could have attacked under the '92 18 judgment, he's in effect trying to split up his habeas, 19 it's second and successive, and that's why he can't do 20 it. 21 MR. COLLINS: That's exactly right, Your 22 Honor. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And further, I 24 thought you told me that the petition goes on to 25 indicate that the conviction while affirmed, that the
31

1 sentence was reversed, looking at 9(b) on joint appendix 2 35. 3 MR. COLLINS: Yes, Your Honor. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which in other 5 words, he details in the petition the subsequent history 6 that would have resulted in a new judgment. 7 MR. COLLINS: That's right, Your Honor. 8 Next I would like to go briefly to the 9 question that Justice Souter asked about -10 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just be sure I 11 understand one thing about that? So you're saying at 12 the time he filed the petition on December 28, 1998, he 13 had already had, the second judgment had already been 14 entered by the Washington Supreme Court? 15 MR. COLLINS: It had been entered by the 16 trial court, Your Honor, so he -17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Pursuant to the reversal 18 of the -19 MR. COLLINS: Exactly, Your Honor. That 20 sentence is on page -- if you look at page 3 of the 21 joint appendix, that is the second amended judgment 22 filed in the superior court in Washington on March 16, 23 1998, and he was confined under the authority of this 24 judgment. 25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of the second judgment?
32
Alderson Reporting Company

1 MR. COLLINS: Of the second judgment. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does it make any less 3 sense to allow separate habeas challenges to, first, the 4 conviction, and then the sentence, than it does to allow 5 separate appeals to this Court from each of those? And 6 once again under the statute, we entertain appeals only 7 from final judgment, but you can bring here on 8 certiorari the judgment of conviction, even though 9 proceedings for the sentence are still in progress. 10 MR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor, I think 11 we're talking about the habeas corpus statute and there 12 the Court -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: A fortiori, we have a lot 14 more control over habeas corpus, which is an equitable 15 remedy, than we do over, what is it, 1257, our 16 jurisdictional statute under certiorari. 17 Why does it make any more sense for habeas 18 purposes to insist that he await the final sentence 19 before he gets review of the premise for that sentence, 20 namely the conviction? 21 MR. COLLINS: Your Honor, I'm sorry. 22 I think that a couple things are being 23 confused here. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. 25 MR. COLLINS: The first thing is when -- is
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 this a successive -- is this a successive petition, and 2 we would say it is, because he filed the first one and 3 then the second one. 4 Now the question of whether he can get 5 relief under the first -- under his first habeas 6 petition does not depend on the entry of a final 7 judgment. In fact, under the facts of this case, the 8 judgment was entered in March of 1998. In December of 9 1998, he filed his first petition. And in fact, the 10 first petition was denied in April of 2000 on the 11 merits, because it had been exhausted, he didn't have to 12 wait for that, because those claims were exhausted and 13 because they were ripe, because they -- the factual 14 predicates had occurred in the trial court, then that 15 was all that was required for him to bring those claims. 16 He didn't have to wait for a final judgment. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're saying he can't 18 later bring any claim about the sentence? 19 MR. COLLINS: That's because Congress in 20 AEDPA has declared that you have to bring all of your 21 claims in your -- at one time, and if you don't, then 22 your petition should be dismissed as successive, unless 23 you go through the gatekeeping solution. 24 JUSTICE SOUTER: So that if the statute 25 governing our review had an exhaustion requirement and a
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 second and successive requirement comparable to the 2 AEDPA requirement, the case that Justice Scalia put 3 would be exactly like this case? 4 MR. COLLINS: I believe so, Your Honor. 5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 6 MR. COLLINS: So I just briefly want to go, 7 Justice Souter, to where you started about the 8 consecutive sentence issue. 9 We believe that consecutive sentence is 10 quite different than, from what exists in Blakely and 11 that, in fact, there aren't really additional findings 12 of fact. I think you referred to about the crime, about 13 the circumstances, about the character. In fact, in 14 this case, the finding of fact entered by the trial 15 court in order to justify the exceptional sentence -16 this is on page 27 of the joint appendix, finding of 17 fact 18 -- if the court were to sentence the defendant 18 to a standard range sentence on each count run 19 concurrently, he would receive the same punishment as if 20 he had committed only the rape in the first degree. 21 This would effectively result in the free crimes 22 of robbery in the first degree and burglary in the first 23 degree because he would receive no additional penalty 24 for those crimes. Now -25 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- I keep doing
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 this. I'm sorry. Is that sufficient, as you understand 2 it, under the Washington case that your brother cited to 3 me? 4 MR. COLLINS: I believe it is, Your Honor. 5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the law was 7 that the sentence shall be concurrent unless, and the 8 unless is that the judge makes an additional finding, 9 the very same kind of finding that he would make in 10 determining aggravating factor. 11 MR. COLLINS: Your Honor, the sentence could 12 have been run consecutively because of an aggravating 13 factor. In fact, in this case the trial court judge, in 14 fact, had three independent and separate reasons for 15 running the sentence consecutively. Two of those would 16 be, I think we would say aggravating factors that the 17 Blakely reasoning would apply to. But the court of 18 appeals when it considered this case only looked at the 19 free crimes element to make that decision. 20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe you can give me just 21 a little more help on this. The finding number 18 that 22 you referred to says in substance, if by just sentencing 23 him on the basis of the jury verdict he won't get -24 he'll get a free pass. But it doesn't say the judge 25 can -- could therefore increase the sentence. It seems
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 to me there had to be additional findings that justify a 2 result that he thought would have been a miscarriage of 3 justice. 4 MR. COLLINS: No, Your Honor. I don't think 5 that's right. 6 JUSTICE STEVENS: You think that just having 7 pointed out that he would get a pass would have been 8 sufficient to justify consecutive sentences? 9 MR. COLLINS: I think it would, and the 10 State supreme court affirmed this decision. 11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah, but he did make 12 additional findings. It goes on. In fact, 19 and 20 13 are additional findings. 14 MR. COLLINS: Your Honor, I think -- I mean, 15 I agree with you that he did make additional findings. 16 But -17 JUSTICE STEVENS: It nowhere says they're 18 unnecessary either. 19 MR. COLLINS: That's true, Your Honor. But 20 if you take a look at the court of appeals opinion which 21 is at page 52 and 53 of the joint appendix, when the 22 court of appeals looks at the sentence, what the court 23 of appeals says is, "nonetheless, the sentencing court 24 concluded that the multiple offender policy alone 25 justified the exceptional sentence. The fact that the
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 defendant offender score for rape in the first degree is 2 16, thus invoking the multiple offense policy of the 3 Sentencing Reform Act standing alone, is a substantial 4 and compelling reason and justification for imposing the 5 exceptional sentence here." 6 JUSTICE SOUTER: That is to say that that 7 would have been sufficient. 8 MR. COLLINS: Exactly. 9 JUSTICE SOUTER: But in fact that is not 10 what the trial court premised its decision on, because, 11 as Justice Stevens points out, it went on in findings 12 19, 20, and 21 about deliberate cruelty, sophistication 13 and planning, and so on. Having been through those 14 findings, the court says, from the foregoing facts the 15 court now makes the following conclusions of law. 16 It seems to me as though the trial court was 17 basing its decision on those foregoing facts as well as 18 upon finding 18, which was the free crime finding. 19 MR. COLLINS: Well, I think that the -20 JUSTICE SOUTER: I guess what I'm saying is 21 the fact that he might have -- I'm assuming for the sake 22 of argument that the trial court might on the basis 23 simply of the free crime conclusion have sentenced 24 consecutively, is simply not the case that we've got, 25 because he sentenced consecutively on that basis and on
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 cruelty, sophistication, and so on. 2 MR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor, I believe 3 that the court of appeals felt that that consecutive 4 sentence on the free crimes was -- standing alone would 5 have been sufficient. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't want to take you 7 up. Let me just have one on the merits, one. I mean, 8 the reason I want you to get to the merits, and I put in 9 my dissent. I was trying as hard as I could to show why 10 I thought this case was wrong. I start the dissent by 11 saying that -- what it says, and then I quote the two 12 sentences that any fact, et cetera, any fact that 13 increases beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must 14 be submitted to a jury and prescribed statutory maximum, 15 again quote, means "solely on the basis of the facts 16 reflected in the jury verdict." Okay. 17 Then at the end of the opinion I say: 18 "Until now I would have thought the Court might have 19 limited Apprendi so its underlying principle wouldn't 20 cause so much harm." Now, the next sentence of course I 21 explain how they might have limited Apprendi, but 22 somehow that disappeared from the opinion because I 23 guess I couldn't think of it. 24 So you're going to tell me now -- I mean, I 25 didn't say how they might have limited Apprendi and I
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 couldn't think of how they might have limited Apprendi, 2 and they read Apprendi to mean what it said. Now, you 3 tell me the phrase I might have put in but couldn't 4 think of that would have limited Apprendi? 5 MR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor, I think that 6 you could have said that the definition of "statutory 7 maximum" is the traditional statutory maximum that was 8 at issue in Apprendi. And in fact in the Apprendi 9 decision the Court specifically, I think in response to 10 Justice O'Connor's dissent, explained that Walton versus 11 Arizona was still good law. And as you know, in Walton 12 the jury would find somebody guilty of aggravated first 13 degree murder, but they could not receive the death 14 penalty unless the judge made additional findings in a 15 hearing. 16 And it seemed to say that the statutory 17 maximum was death and that in fact the judge's findings 18 would not take you above that statutory maximum. I 19 think that -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't that overturned in 21 Ring? 22 MR. COLLINS: It was overturned in Ring, 23 Your Honor. But when you had lower court appellate 24 judges looking at your decision in Apprendi and seeing 25 the fact that Walton and Apprendi were consistent, it
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 was logical for them to conclude, as virtually every 2 single court did except for Kansas, that the definition 3 of "statutory maximum" was the traditional statutory 4 maximum that was in Apprendi. 5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Was it logical for them to 6 conclude it or were they -- were they expressing the 7 hope that the Court would draw a distinction which it 8 had not drawn in the formulation that it gave in 9 Apprendi? It's one thing to say that if you draw no 10 further distinctions, Apprendi requires a certain 11 result. It's another thing to say but maybe they will 12 draw a distinction and we're going to predict that they 13 will, and hence not apply Apprendi. 14 Weren't the other appellate courts to which 15 you refer engaged in the latter exercise, which I call 16 the exercise of hope? 17 MR. COLLINS: I'm not sure that I would 18 agree with that, Justice Souter, only because as I think 19 Justice O'Connor explained in her dissent, there are two 20 ways to read Apprendi, and one of those ways would 21 result in upholding guideline systems which are now 22 invalid because of Blakely and Booker, but really quite 23 different from Apprendi because those systems involve 24 what you would call guided discretion. That is, in 25 Apprendi if you wanted the aggravating factor if the
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 judge found it by a preponderance then the sentence was 2 enhanced. 3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but doesn't that 4 require drawing a distinction that Apprendi did not 5 speak to? And isn't it still the case that, I think 6 Mr. Fisher points out that three times we repeated in 7 Apprendi the formula about fact, beyond fact found by a 8 jury on the basis of which, et cetera, the range 9 increases. 10 Isn't the distinction which -- and I trust 11 your recollection here -- that Justice O'Connor had in 12 mind and that they had in mind a distinction which 13 simply was not addressed in Apprendi and would have been 14 something new as opposed to merely an application of 15 what was implicit in Apprendi? 16 MR. COLLINS: I believe it definitely would 17 have been something new, Your Honor. 18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 20 Mr. Collins. 21 Mr. Roberts? 22 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS 23 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, 24 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT 25 MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 please the Court: 2 If I could begin by addressing the issues 3 that you were just talking about, there was a 4 distinction that the Court could have drawn between 5 Apprendi and Blakely and that reasonable jurists could 6 have drawn and did draw. One was the formal distinction 7 that you were discussing before with the State, which 8 was supported by Justice O'Connor's proposing that as an 9 interpretation in her dissent and the majority not 10 responding to that, that that distinction was contrary 11 to the rule but implausible, but in fact accepting 12 the -- accepting that it was a plausible distinction and 13 saying that it still wouldn't have made a difference, 14 that the Apprendi rule still was important. 15 The second -- and in addition to that, that 16 distinction that Justice O'Connor drew there was 17 consistent with the Apprendi Court's distinction of 18 Walton. And you have to look at what reasonable jurists 19 could have interpreted looking at that decision at the 20 time with those distinctions and what the Court said in 21 Apprendi. 22 But in addition to that, there was more than 23 a formal distinction that could have been drawn between 24 the system in Apprendi and the Washington guidelines 25 system. That's the distinction that we proposed in our
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 amicus brief in Blakely and it rested on the fact that 2 sentencing guideline systems like Washington try to 3 channel but not to eliminate the discretion that 4 sentencing judges have to sentence within the otherwise 5 applicable limits. And in the Washington system the 6 sentencing judge retained a significant degree of 7 discretion that reasonable jurists could have analogized 8 to traditional sentencing systems that aren't 9 constrained by Apprendi. 10 The facts, the facts on which the judge 11 could rely to go above the guidelines, were not 12 specified as in Apprendi and as in Ring by the 13 legislature, but it was a wide open set that enabled the 14 judge himself or herself to determine what facts the 15 judge thought could justify a higher sentence; and in 16 addition, the facts alone didn't trigger the higher 17 sentence. The judge had to look at those facts and make 18 the additional determination that those facts rose to 19 the level of substantial and compelling reasons that 20 justified the higher sentence. 21 In that respect, the judge had a degree of 22 sentencing discretion to decide what facts justified it 23 and whether it was in fact justified. 24 Now, of course, this Court rejected those 25 distinctions in Blakely. But the question is whether a
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 reasonable jurist could have accepted those distinctions 2 and drawn a difference, and we submit that they could 3 have. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Roberts, do you 5 have a position on whether we have a successive petition 6 problem here? 7 MR. ROBERTS: We don't have a position on 8 that precise, on that particular issue here, because it 9 can't arise for Federal prisoners. But let me explain 10 why it can't arise for Federal prisoners because perhaps 11 that will give the Court some guidance in resolving the 12 issue. In the Federal system, it's well established 13 that the conviction and the sentence are part of a 14 unitary judgment and that that unitary judgment doesn't 15 become final until the conviction and the sentence have 16 both been fully adjudicated. 17 That understanding is reflected in the 18 language of 28 U.S.C. 2255, which is the statute that 19 authorizes collateral attacks by Federal prisoners. 20 That statute authorizes attacks -- what it authorizes is 21 motions to vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence. So 22 it's clear from that that it's not authorizing 23 collateral attacks on a conviction independent of the 24 attendant sentence. And I think that could shed some 25 guidance here, because 2255 was intended to be a
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 parallel and substitute remedy to traditional habeas for 2 Federal prisoners. 3 I would also make a point on the other sort 4 of preliminary issues that were being discussed on the 5 consecutive sentence issue, that it's not only the fact 6 that the judge said that the multiple offense policy 7 standing alone could justify the consecutive sentence 8 here and that the court of appeals relied on that in 9 upholding that. 10 But the court of appeals went further, 11 because petitioner had made a separate challenge to -12 and this is on page 52 and 53 of the joint appendix. 13 Petitioner made a separate challenge to the other two 14 aggravating factors. Petitioner argued that the 15 district court wasn't allowed to rely on -- excuse me, 16 the trial court couldn't rely on those two other 17 aggravating factors because he had not relied on them in 18 the original sentencing and this was a resentencing. 19 The court of appeals rejected that challenge 20 and it rejected that challenge because it said the 21 sentencing court concluded that the multiple offense 22 policy alone justified the exceptional sentence, and 23 then on page 53 it said: "The sentencing court did not 24 rely on the additional aggravating factors for imposing 25 an exceptional sentence." So I think these --

Because, 5 having talked, as I just read out a moment ago, having 6 spoken about free crimes, aggravating factors, it says, 7 on the basis of the foregoing facts I now draw the 8 following conclusions of law. 9 MR. ROBERTS: The trial court said each of 10 the three standing alone was sufficient. But what the 11 court of appeals said is these other two have been 12 challenged, but these other two are -- we're not going 13 to deal with this challenge to these other two 14 factors because they're out of the case. So I think 15 that this Court has to take the case as coming from -16 coming from the Washington courts as if what the courts 17 essentially said is those other two are not in the case 18 any more. 19 JUSTICE SOUTER: So we can treat it in 20 effect -- and this may be the way to do it -- we can 21 treat it as the ultimate sentencer was the Washington 22 appellate court and that's what they said? 23 MR. ROBERTS: Well, what the Washington 24 appellate court essentially, they could have said 25 petitioner is right, those other two aggravating factors

1 couldn't be relied on, and so we're relying on this the 2 standing alone. What they chose to do is, we're going 3 to interpret what the trial court did as relying only on 4 the one. And that was the basis for responding to that 5 claim of error, and I do think that the Court has to 6 take this case as coming on that basis. 7 If I could turn to the issue of Blakely 8 retroactivity for a few minutes. In addition to the 9 points that I made before about why Blakely was a new 10 rule, I would also submit that Blakely is not a 11 watershed rule because it's not a bedrock rule that's 12 essential to a fair trial, and rules are only bedrock if 13 they approach the fundamental and sweeping importance of 14 Gideon, and Blakely doesn't have that kind of importance 15 for three reasons. First, the right to counsel 16 pervasively affects every aspect of the trial, but 17 Blakely affects only the procedure for determining the 18 punishment of defendants who have already been found 19 guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of all the elements of a 20 crime. 21 Second, a felony trial in which the 22 defendant is denied counsel is inherently unfair, but 23 it's not inherently unfair to use the preponderance 24 standard to find facts that determine the extent of 25 punishment, and in fact the Constitution permits the use
48

1 of a preponderance standard to find many facts that have 2 as much or more impact on punishment as facts covered by 3 Blakely. Those include facts that trigger mandatory 4 minimums, facts on which a judge relies to sentence 5 within a broad statutory range, and even facts on which 6 a judge relies to sentence above the standard range in 7 advisory guideline systems. 8 Third, counsel is so essential to a fair 9 trial that deprivation of the right can never be 10 discounted as harmless error. But this Court held in 11 Recuenco that Blakely errors can be harmless, and in 12 reaching that holding the Court expressly concluded that 13 Blakely errors do not necessarily render a criminal 14 trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for 15 determining guilt or innocence. 16 That conclusion seems to strongly suggest 17 that Blakely is not a bedrock rule essential to a fair 18 trial. 19 If the Court has no further questions -20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 21 Mr. Fisher, you have four minutes remaining. 22 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 23 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 24 MR. FISHER: Let me say one word on 25 jurisdiction and then turn to two comments on the
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 merits. On jurisdiction, I think Mr. Roberts is right 2 that this rarely happens in the Federal system. It 3 rarely happens in the State system. We can't find any 4 other case where a petitioner has gone in naming, as the 5 State would say, in effect the wrong judgment and 6 saying: "I'm challenging this judgment." 7 But what happened here was just that. 8 Mr. Burton went in and said he was challenging the 1994 9 judgment. And under this Court's Castro decision, when 10 a pro se petitioner comes in and says I'm doing one 11 thing, in that case making a motion for a new trial, it 12 can't be converted into something else which is a first 13 habeas petition without advising the petitioner. And 14 here, not only was he not advised by the trial court but 15 the State in its own answer, which we attached to our 16 reply brief, agreed that he could challenge the 1994 17 conviction, and said that conviction is final, and he 18 can challenge that judgment, the 1994 judgment. 19 So it's way too late in the day for the 20 State to stand up to you now and say this pro se 21 petitioner should bear the burden of bringing an 22 improper petition. 23 On the merits, I don't want to elaborate 24 beyond simply just telling this Court that if you look 25 at the Hughes decision and you look at the Washington
50

Official
1 decision from the Washington state courts, it is clear 2 that an extra finding was necessary here, even if the 3 only aggravator in play is the free crimes are clearly 4 too lenient factor. Hughes makes it crystal clear that 5 a judge needs to find, and I'm quoting, "extraordinarily 6 serious harm or culpability arising from the multiple 7 offenses." And to the extent that the State stands 8 before you now and quotes from parts of Mr. Burton's 9 case where the trial judge did not explicitly make that 10 finding, that only reinforces the strength of his habeas 11 petition now, that under Washington state law, the judge 12 needed to make that kind of an extra finding and the 13 judge didn't do so. 14 Let me finally turn to a discussion about 15 whether this Court's treatment of Walton and Apprendi 16 could have given a State judge a reasonable basis to 17 distinguish the system at issue in Blakely. We don't 18 think it could because this Court didn't simply say in 19 Apprendi that Walton stands. It explicitly said the 20 reason why the Arizona capital system as we understand 21 it is okay is because it's nothing more than a system 22 that is permissible under Williams against New York. 23 It's one where on the basis of the jury's 24 finding of guilt that the death penalty is permissible 25 without anything else. And so the only disagreement
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 between the majority and Justice O'Connor's dissent was 2 as to the way Arizona's system worked, but any judge that 3 would have looked at Apprendi would have seen, the 4 majority is telling us that a system is okay so long as 5 the jury verdict itself allows the ultimate sentence. 6 That is exactly the kind of system that was 7 not in place in Washington, so a judge should have full 8 well realized. 9 And of course as Justice Ginsburg pointed 10 out, once it became clear to this Court the way that 11 Arizona's capital sentencing system functioned, this 12 Court had little difficulty simply applying the Apprendi rule 13 and agreeing that that system had to be invalid too. 14 And just like the Blakely decision itself, not even the 15 dissenters suggested that Apprendi dictated otherwise. 16 If this Court has no further questions, I'll 17 submit the case. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 19 Mr. Fisher. The case is submitted. 20 (Whereupon, at 12:01 a.m., the case in the 21 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 22 23 24 25
