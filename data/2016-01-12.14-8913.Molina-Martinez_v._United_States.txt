3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Case 148913, MolinaMartinez v.

5 United States.

6  Mr. Crooks.

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY CROOKS

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9  MR. CROOKS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11  As this Court recognized in Peugh v.

12 United States, the United States Sentencing Guidelines

13 remain uniquely central to Federal sentencing even where

14 the district court ultimately chooses to sentence

15 outside the Guidelines.

16  Because of the strong anchoring effect of

17 the Guidelines, as also recognized in Peugh, the natural

18 effect of an erroneously high Guideline range is to skew

19 a defendant's sentence higher than it would have been

20 under the correct range.  Yet when the district court

21 has elected to sentence within what it believes to be

22 the correct range, it is typically very difficult to

23 determine what the district court would have done had it

24 been presented with the correct lower range.

25  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Crooks, you didn't

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
4 1 cite 18 U.S.C. 3742(f), and I wondered why, because it 2 reads:  "If the court of appeals determines that the 3 sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect 4 application of the Sentencing Guidelines, the court 5 shall remand the case for further sentencing proceedings 6 with such instructions as the court considers 7 appropriate." 8  So this seems to say that, if the 9 incorrect  there was an incorrect application of the 10 Guidelines, then a remand is mandatory. 11  MR. CROOKS:  It  it does appear to say 12 that, Justice Ginsburg; however, I believe in this 13 Court's decision in Williams v. United States, the Court 14 said that Guideline errors are nonetheless subject to 15 the normal doctrines of harmless and plainerror review 16 and not subject to automatic reversal. 17  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And  and so it's not 18 clear that there was a Guidelines violation here.  The 19 Guidelines were incorrectly calculated, but it's not 20 clear that at the end of the day there was a violation. 21  I mean, is that really your response to 22 Justice Ginsburg, or am I oversimplifying? 23  MR. CROOKS:  There was a misapplication of 24 the Guidelines, but harmless and plainerror doctrines 25 apply to determine the remedy for that violation or
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 misapplication.

5

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, there was a

3 miscalculation.  I'm not sure if there was a

4 misapplication.  That's  I  I suppose that's the

5 issue in the case.  Or  or is this 

6  MR. CROOKS:  We believe 

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY:   is this quibble wrong?

8  MR. CROOKS:  We believe that there was a

9 misapplication because the Guidelines were incorrectly

10 calculated with respect to the defendant's criminal

11 history.  And that is the type of thing that the statute

12 Justice Ginsburg was referring to says you should remand

13 for, subject, of course, as this Court says in Williams,

14 to the normal doctrines of harmless and plain error.

15  And we're here today, of course, on a

16 plainerror case because we have a Guideline

17 misapplication that unfortunately was not discovered by

18 anyone below.

19  JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you say that when

20 there is a  excuse me  a miscalculation of the

21 Guidelines range, that should give rise to a rebuttable

22 presumption that the miscalculation affected the

23 sentence that the judge imposed.

24  MR. CROOKS:  That's correct, Justice Alito.

25  JUSTICE ALITO:  And what does that mean?

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 Does that mean that the  the burden of persuasion

6

2 shifts to the prosecution?

3  MR. CROOKS:  We believe that the Court's

4 opinion in Olano actually supports a conceptualization

5 that it simply gives the defendant an alternative way to

6 satisfy his burden of persuasion, which is done in a

7 generalized rather than a casespecific way.

8  JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose there's no

9 evidence, as  as will  may very often be the case.

10 Suppose the judge says  imposes a sentence within what

11 the judge believes to be the Guideline range but says

12 nothing whatsoever beyond that, and it turns out that

13 that is not the correct Guidelines range, so that

14 there's no evidence one way or the other about what the

15 judge would have done had the judge understood the

16 correct Guidelines range.

17  What outcome in that situation?

18  MR. CROOKS:  In that situation, typically

19 the result would be that the third prong of plainerror

20 review would be satisfied and the defendant would have

21 shown an effect on his substantial right.

22  JUSTICE ALITO:  So that means that the

23 burden of persuasion in that situation is on the

24 prosecution.

25  MR. CROOKS:  Again, we may be quibbling

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
7 1 about terms, but we believe that the defendant satisfies 2 his burden of persuasion with generalized evidence 3 tending to show the  that the natural effect of a 4 Guideline error is to affect the sentence. 5  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I  I don't think I 6 understand the difference between general and specific. 7 Evidence is evidence.  And you draw inferences from all 8 sorts of circumstances.  So I don't know why you call 9 this general.  It's evidence.  Okay? 10  Let's assume the Guideline was 70 to 100. 11 The erroneous Guideline was 80 to 100, and the right 12 Guideline was 70 to 100. 13  Would we  you draw a general inference 14 that the corrected Guideline would have made any 15 difference on that sentence? 16  MR. CROOKS:  We would, Your Honor.  Our 17 position is that anytime the range is not the correct 18 range, there should be a presumption that it affected  19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what changed the 20 judge's mind in terms of the facts?  He gave you the max 21 when it was 80 to 100.  What's going to change his mind 22 about 70 to 100? 23  MR. CROOKS:  Because the fact that the 24 Sentencing Commission gave a different range in its 25 expert advice and its expertise is something that this
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 Court has recognized factors heavily into district

8

2 courts' decisions.

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's assume I don't

4 believe there's a presumption, okay?  It's very hard for

5 me to understand what difference between 70 and 100 and

6 80 and 100 could make.  In this case, I have a

7 difficulty understanding what difference the  the

8 Criminal History Category would make.

9  But I'll give you another example of

10 overlapping Guidelines:  a defendant who's never

11 committed a crime and a defendant who has committed a

12 crime.  I would be more inclined to say that an

13 inference from the facts is that a defendant who's never

14 been committed of a crime, that the judge might take

15 that into consideration, even in an overlapping

16 Guideline case, and send it back.  Because we don't know

17 how much mercy that judge might have shown.  But if a

18 defendant like yours has many criminal convictions, I'd

19 be pretty close to saying I don't think he's going to

20 make much of a different choice.

21  MR. CROOKS:  But on the other hand, Your

22 Honor, in this case, despite Mr. MolinaMartinez's

23 criminal history, the district judge imposed the bottom

24 of what he believed the Guidelines to be, despite the

25 government's request for a sentence at the top end of

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 the Guideline range.  And our position is that the

9

2 natural pull of the Guidelines is so strong, so

3 influential, that it is going to pull the judge toward

4 the erroneous range, and therefore 

5  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Crooks, let  let me

6 ask you this:  You fail to object to the erroneous use

7 of the  of the Guidelines.  If you had objected, what

8 would the situation be?  You would have to establish

9 that the error was not harmless, or the  the

10 government would have to establish that it was harmless,

11 right?  Would there be a presumption of nonharmlessness?

12  MR. CROOKS:  I believe under Rule 52(a)

13 there is in effect a presumption of nonharmlessness that

14 the government must rebut.  The government must show

15 that the error was harmless.

16  JUSTICE SCALIA:  To show that the error was

17 harmless is the same as saying there is a presumption

18 that it wasn't harmless.

19  MR. CROOKS:  I believe 

20  JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's  that's not the 

21  MR. CROOKS:   the facts 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA:   not the way I normally

23 talk.  I would normally say the burden  the burden of

24 establishing it is on the government, but I wouldn't say

25 there's a presumption.

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1  MR. CROOKS:  But 

10

2  JUSTICE SCALIA:  The government is wrong.

3  MR. CROOKS:  But if the government makes no

4 effort to do anything with respect to harmlessness, then

5 the case will be reversed, or there will be 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The  the government 

7 the government says that you are, in effect, making this

8 standard harmless.  That you  you admit that this is a

9 plainerror case, and yet, your presumption, effectively

10 the burden is on the government, is making this into a

11 harmlesserror situation.

12  MR. CROOKS:  It is, but  in a way, but

13 only for the limited class of errors that are Guideline

14 range errors.  Under Rule 52(a), the government must

15 show harmlessness for every type of error.

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under Justice Alito's

18 questioning, he asked if  isn't it true that you have

19 the burden of persuasion at the outset to show that

20 there was a miscalculation?  Once you meet that, his

21 question was does the government then  I believe his

22 question was  does the government then have the burden

23 of persuasion to show no error.  He was careful not to

24 use the word "presumption," or at least he did not use

25 the word "presumption."

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
11 1  Is that the proper way to think of this case 2 in your view?  Another way of asking the question is  3 continues with what Justice Alito was inquiring:  Do we 4 need to use the word "presumption" here? 5  MR. CROOKS:  I don't think the word 6 "presumption" is absolutely necessary.  It is the word 7 that the Court used in Olano, but I think it  it's 8 really viewed more as who bears the risk of 9 nonpersuasion.  And what we're asking is that in the 10 very limited context of a Guidelinerange error, the 11 defendant should be deemed to have carried his burden by 12 the generalized evidence that this Court recognized in 13 Peugh v. United States, that the Guidelines do affect 14 sentences and that Guideline ranges do affect what the 15 district court does. 16  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where have we done that 17 before?  I mean, we had dictum in United States v. 18 Olano, which said that there may be a special category. 19 There may be a special category of forfeited errors that 20 can be corrected, regardless of their effect on the 21 outcome.  But this issue need not be  be addressed. 22 And you're saying  and we have not found any such 23 category in the past.  You're saying you  we have 24 finally  finally discovered one category that meets 25 that dictum in Olano.
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
12 1  MR. CROOKS:  Well, the lower courts  this 2 Court has not found a presumption since Olano, but the 3 Court did give careful consideration to whether a 4 presumption should apply to the particular type of error 5 at issue in Olano. 6  But more importantly, the lower courts have 7 looked to what this Court said in Olano, and in a tiny 8 handful of  of errors, they have adopted just such a 9 rebuttal. 10  JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's more important? 11 That the lower courts have established the law for us? 12  MR. CROOKS:  It's not  13  JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me we establish 14 the law, and we have never found anything to come within 15 that language in Olano.  And it's dictum, and maybe it's 16 wrong. 17  MR. CROOKS:  We believe that it's not wrong, 18 and that the lower courts' decisions, of course, do not 19 bind the Court, but they are expressive of the 20 experience of the lower courts. 21  JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Crooks, if I could 22 take you back to your answer to Justice Kennedy.  I take 23 it that you don't need to use the word "presumption," 24 right?  You're  you're  the burden that you have to 25 carry in  in a  in plainerror review is you have to
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
13 1 show a reasonable probability.  And your argument would 2 work just fine if you dropped the word "presumption"; 3 isn't that right?  And you just said that the anchoring 4 effect of the Guidelines creates a reasonable 5 probability that the outcome would be different in a 6 case in which the Court initially thought that the range 7 was different from what it turned out to be.  Sort of 8 the end.  Who needs the word "presumption"? 9  MR. CROOKS:  We agree, Justice Kagan. 10 Unfortunately, the Fifth Circuit did not, so. 11  But we do believe that  that however you 12 conceptualize it, the draw, the pull of the Guidelines 13 is because of the unique centrality of the Guidelines 14 sufficient to establish the reasonable probability of a 15 different result. 16  JUSTICE SCALIA:  What good does it do to say 17 that the Guidelines are advisory, which is what we have 18 held, if, when you mistake them or when you don't apply 19 them properly, you automatically get a reversal, which 20 is what you're arguing here?  Does that sound like an 21 advisory Guideline? 22  MR. CROOKS:  Well, Justice Scalia, we 23 disagree.  It's an automatic reversal.  Besides the 24 third prong of plainerror review, there are two other 25 very stringent prongs, the second and the fourth that
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 must be met before there can be a reversal on plain

14

2 error.  But with respect to the question of whether it

3 makes the Guidelines any less advisory, we don't believe

4 that it does.  It simply recognizes the fact that even

5 though they're now advisory, district court judges still

6 find them influential and persuasive as this Court

7 indicated they should do in Rita.

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How did this  how did

9 this error come to light?  Everybody missed it in the

10 district court.  It started with the probation officer,

11 the judge, and the defendant.  How did  how was it

12 found out?

13  MR. CROOKS:  Well, actually, it was missed

14 initially, even on appeal, because I wrote an Anders

15 brief, and the defendant wrote a response and pointed

16 out that one of my factual premises was incorrect.

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So the defendant  the

18 defendant brought  detected the error.

19  MR. CROOKS:  Correct.  And when I saw it, I

20 realized immediately I had made a mistake, and I filed a

21 merits brief with the Fifth Circuit instead of an Anders

22 brief.  And it proceeded to oral argument in the

23 Fifth Circuit.  The government conceded that there was

24 an error that was plain, but they disputed that it

25 affected substantial rights because of the overlap of

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 the Guidelines.

15

2  JUSTICE ALITO:  Your argument has some

3 appeal on the facts of this case because the judge

4 sentenced the defendant to a sentence at the bottom of

5 what the judge understood to be the Guideline range.

6 But would your argument apply to any sentence that was

7 within both the original and the correct Guideline

8 range?

9  Suppose the judge here had sentenced your

10 client to 87 months, which I  I think is the top of

11 the correct Guideline range.  Would the same  would

12 you  can you infer from that that the judge would not

13 have imposed that sentence had the judge understood

14 that  the judge thought that the top was 96, judge

15 chose 87, that happens to fall within the correct

16 Guideline range.  On those facts, would you infer that

17 the judge would have imposed a lesser sentence?

18  MR. CROOKS:  Our answer is that whenever the

19 range changes in the absence of any other indication,

20 you should infer that the sentence  there was at least

21 a reasonable probability that the sentence would change.

22  There may be other contextual factors

23 besides the high end of the Guidelines that would allow

24 the government to show that in fact it wouldn't have

25 made a difference.  But if I understand Your Honor's

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 question correctly, with only the difference in the

16

2 range, we believe that that is a situation where you

3 should assume there's a reasonable probability.

4  JUSTICE ALITO:  Why would you 

5  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I was  I was just

6 going to say under that  I suppose the defendant

7 really wouldn't insist on a resentencing if that were

8 the  those were the facts, would he?

9  In other words, it was incorrectly a maximum

10 of 87 and he got the maximum, you say, oh, well the

11 correct one could give you up to 96.  If I understand

12 it, the defendant is not going to raise that objection,

13 is he?

14  MR. CROOKS:  If he believes that he could

15 get more  but if  for example, in this case the

16 incorrect range was 77 to 96.  If he got 96, he might

17 well insist upon appealing because he might think the

18 judge would give me the high end of the correct range.

19  JUSTICE ALITO:  How about  I mean, the

20 question is, if the judge  the judge thinks it's 77 to

21 96 and chooses 87, which is within that range, and it

22 turns out the correct range is 70 to 87, so the 87 is

23 within the correct range as well  it's the top of the

24 correct range  what  what reason would there be to

25 infer  why would there be a natural probability that

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 the judge would have given a lesser sentence if the

17

2 judge thought that the top was 87 as opposed to 96?  The

3 judge obviously thought in that situation the correct

4 sentence is  is 87.

5  MR. CROOKS:  With respect, I have to

6 disagree with your premise because I don't believe

7 judges just pick numbers.  I believe they look at the

8 Guideline range and typically determine whether the

9 defendant should be low, middle, or high.  So the

10 Guideline range does make a difference.  And it 

11  JUSTICE BREYER:  Here's an example:  Suppose

12 a person  everybody  presentence report, government,

13 defense lawyer, prosecutor, everybody  thought he's in

14 column 2.  Okay?  He's not a firsttimer.  And now it

15 turns out they made a mistake.  He is a firsttimer.

16 And so being a recidivist, the presentence report says

17 put him at the top of the range.  Now it's a lower

18 range, but they know he's not a recidivist.

19  Depending on the circumstance they might

20 say, Hey, no, put him in the middle of the firsttimers.

21 I don't know.  You don't know.  They don't know.  Nobody

22 knows.  And so the question is, we don't know, really,

23 what the judge will do upon remand.  Common sense

24 suggests ask him.  That's what it suggests.  And so

25 you're worried about whether you can work the language

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 around to let you do that, what is common sense.

18

2  I'll have some questions for the other side,

3 which I suspect you can, but nonetheless, isn't that the

4 issue?

5  MR. CROOKS:  That  that is the issue.  And

6 we 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's factor in the fact

8 that you did not object.  Surely  surely there ought

9 to be a penalty for that.  We don't treat cases where

10 there has been an objection the same as we treat cases

11 where  where there has not been.  Sending it back

12 makes total sense when there is an objection that's 

13 that's wrongfully denied.

14  JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

15  JUSTICE SCALIA:  But  but where you or

16 defense counsel has, in effect, assisted the Court's

17 error, it seems to me we demand more.

18  MR. CROOKS:  And the Court does demand more.

19 It is much more difficult to secure relief on

20 plainerror review because of the other prongs of the

21 rule.

22  JUSTICE BREYER:  But anyway, we've got

23 progress, because it does make sense.  And if we've got

24 progress, it is not a punishment to the lawyer for not

25 having raised it.  It is a set of circumstances where

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 the result will make sense without unnecessary

19

2 administrative problems.

3  JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not a matter of

4 punishing the lawyer, is it?  It's a matter of

5 establishing a system 

6  JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, that's right.

7  JUSTICE SCALIA:   that induces lawyers to

8 make objections when objections are proper and  and

9 not to mousetrap the  the Court into  into error

10 by  by not  by not objecting.

11  MR. CROOKS:  But we have 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA:  What are the other two

13 elements that you think serve that purpose?

14  MR. CROOKS:  Well, first, the second and the

15 fourth prong is the answer to your question.  But first

16 I have to say 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA:  But what are the second and

18 fourth prongs?

19  MR. CROOKS:  The second prong is that the

20 error must be plain, which means it's not subject to

21 reasonable dispute.

22  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's no big deal.

23 It  that doesn't satisfy my problem.

24  MR. CROOKS:  Well, many Guideline errors are

25 not.  We have had plainerror relief denied repeatedly

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 on the second prong.

20

2  The fourth prong, that it must seriously

3 affect the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of

4 judicial proceedings, is another hurdle that the

5 defendant must meet on plainerror review.

6  A person is not in a better position by not

7 objecting.  A person would be foolish not to make an

8 objection that would lower the range because it's always

9 better in a sentencing proceeding to start out with a

10 lower range, even if you're going to ask for something

11 below the Guidelines.

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's not disputed here.

13 Everybody missed it.  You missed it, and you  you were

14 candid in saying even on appeal you were ready to file

15 an Anders brief until the defendant himself.

16  MR. CROOKS:  Yes, Your Honor.  In fact I did

17 file an Anders brief.

18  JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's  it's not enough

19 that the lawyer did not intentionally do it.  We  we

20 demand of lawyers that they do it.  They're supposed to

21 assist the Court.  And where the objection has not been

22 made, it's  it's an entirely different case when it

23 comes up here.

24  MR. CROOKS:  But I would suggest,

25 Justice Scalia, that it is still far more difficult to

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
21 1 secure relief on plainerror review, even with the tweak 2 to the third prong that we're suggesting, than it is to 3 just make the objection in the first place. 4  JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, can you give us an 5 example of a Guidelines error that would qualify for  6 qualify as a plainerror except for its failure to 7 satisfy the fourth prong of Olano? 8  MR. CROOKS:  Yes.  In our reply brief on 9 page 22, we cited the Fifth Circuit's decision in 10 United States v. DuqueHernandez.  And in that case, the 11 Fifth Circuit actually pretermitted the first three 12 prongs of plainerror review and said even if you meet 13 these, you lose on the fourth prong for three different 14 reasons. 15  First, the Court said that the defendant had 16 in fact admitted the criminal conduct that underlay the 17 controverted Sentencing Guideline enhancement. 18  Second, there was an issue of quasi dirty 19 hands because the defense attorney had failed to make an 20 objection that the same defense attorney had made in a 21 previous illegal reentry case. 22  And third, the defendant had an 23 extraordinarily serious criminal history involving drugs 24 and guns.  And that is an example, one example  there 25 are others  where the Fifth Circuit has applied the
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 fourth prong very stringently.

22

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who would apply 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, in that case would

4 you still send it back to the district judge to ask him

5 in the case you just put?

6  MR. CROOKS:  The 

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We're trying to  let's

8 assume that we're going to give you some relief  that

9 was far from clear, but let's assume that.  We're trying

10 to find out what the rule ought to be, what the standard

11 ought to be.  In the case you just explained to us, in

12 your view, should that case go back to the district

13 court?

14  MR. CROOKS:  The case that I just described?

15  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.

16  MR. CROOKS:  I  I don't know whether I

17 necessarily agree with that application of the fourth

18 prong of plainerror 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who applies the first

20 prong in the first instance?  Is it 

21  MR. CROOKS:  The court of appeals.

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you're saying that

23 even if the court of appeals gets through the first

24 three, it doesn't remand for the district court to  to

25 apply the fourth test.  It  the court of appeals does

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 that itself?

23

2  MR. CROOKS:  Correct.  And if the defendant

3 cannot satisfy the fourth prong of plainerror review,

4 there is no reversal and no resentencing.

5  JUSTICE KAGAN:  So I would think that the

6 answer to Justice Kennedy's question is if the court of

7 appeals really thinks it's not going to give relief

8 because of the fourth prong, why would you bother

9 remanding it?

10  MR. CROOKS:  Why  why would the court 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why would  why would the

12 court of appeals bother remanding it?  They could

13 legitimately say it doesn't matter.  We're not going to

14 remand it because whatever happens on remand, we're not

15 going to give relief based on the fourth prong.  And if

16 that's the case, why would the court of appeals remand

17 it at all?

18  MR. CROOKS:  The court of  if the

19 defendant does not  if the court of appeals is not

20 satisfied that the defendant has met his burden on the

21 fourth prong, it will not be remanded; the judgment will

22 be affirmed.

23  And I would like to save the remainder of my

24 time for rebuttal.

25  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And may I just ask you to

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 answer the government's position that if there's no

24

2 presumption, it's not in your question presented so 

3 so that you will lock into the way you phrased the 

4 the question, that "should an appellate court presume"?

5  MR. CROOKS:  Just very briefly, our answer

6 is that the Court in the cases we cited in the reply

7 brief has gone on to consider the merits of a case after

8 deciding a legal question presented by the Petitioner.

9 And certainly, the Court always has the power and the

10 discretion to address a question, even that was not in

11 the question presented or addressed in the court below.

12  And here, the court below undisputably

13 addressed it, and even if the Court does not endorse the

14 presumption we ask for, it would be useful guidance to

15 the lower courts on the application of the third prong.

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

17  Mr. Meisler.

18  ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A.C. MEISLER

19  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20  MR. MEISLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

21 please the Court:

22  This Court should not adopt the presumption

23 that all misapplications of the Sentencing Guidelines

24 are presumptively prejudicial, for three main reasons:

25  First, a presumption is not supported by

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 this Court's plainerror precedence or general

25

2 principles of appellate review for harmlessness.

3  Second, presumption is unnecessary, because

4 courts of appeal are capable of discerning prejudice on

5 a casespecific basis.

6  And third, a presumption illserves the

7 policies  policies that underlie Rule 52(b); in

8 particular, they need to induce timely objections in the

9 district court.

10  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I  I am concerned

11 about getting hung up on the labels.  Okay?  If you 

12 so don't say it's a presumption.  We still have, don't

13 we, the question of what happens if nobody  and who

14 loses if there's no evidence to move one way or another

15 in a tie?

16  It doesn't matter if you call it a

17 "presumption" or not.  Who bears the burden of at least

18 moving forward, and certainly the burden of proof, if

19 one of these errors is on the record?

20  MR. MEISLER:  I think, Your Honor, this

21 Court's decisions in Olano and United States v. Vaughn

22 resolve that question, and makes it clear the burden is

23 on the defendant under plainerror review.  That is what

24 the Court has said is the main difference on prong three

25 on the substantialrights prong between plainerror and

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 harmlesserror review.

26

2  JUSTICE KAGAN:  But let's say that's right:

3 Yes, the burden is on the defendant.  But does the

4 defendant meet that burden by saying, look, there was a

5 mistake in the Guidelines; we know that there's an

6 anchoring effect.  That's what the Court said in Peugh.

7 That anchoring effect creates a reasonable probability

8 that the Court would have done something differently.

9  MR. MEISLER:  And so our  our answer, Your

10 Honor, is that the  there's no  I guess what

11 Mr. Crooks calls a "generalized showing."  I think it

12 has to be done on a factspecific basis.

13  JUSTICE BREYER:  That is factspecific.  I

14 mean, I have exactly the same question as Justice Kagan

15 had.  Forget all the jargon.  You're a  a lawyer.  You

16 want to prove that it rained at noon on the 5th of

17 February.

18  Your witness says, I heard pitterpatter on

19 the roof.  I looked outside.  Water was going by the

20 window.

21  Anything else?

22  No.

23  Well, it might have been the window washer,

24 but there is no jury that couldn't find that it was

25 raining.

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
27 1  Same thing here.  Case after case, this 2 Court has said:  We assume, we presume  or they don't 3 even use those words  the Guidelines influence the 4 sentence.  That's what they meant by the word "anchor." 5  If you look at the reality, whether they 6 depart or don't  whatever you call it now.  There's 7 some special word  you can find evidence after  of 8 course, the Guidelines affect the sentence.  Maybe 9 there's an unusual case, and they don't. 10  The reason the judge doesn't say anything is 11 because in Rita we said that if you say nothing, Judge, 12 then the appellate courts are to assume it was 13 reasonable.  And therefore, the judge now says nothing. 14 He just applies the Guideline. 15  So we'd have to overcome about five cases in 16 terms of what we said if we are going to rebut the 17 common sense notion that of course using the wrong 18 Guideline had an effect on the sentence.  If it's an 19 unusual case, i.e. if it's the window washer, let the 20 government show it was the window washer.  But the 21 normal case, pitterpatter means rain, and the normal 22 case is that the judge, when he uses the Guidelines, or 23 even when he uses them as a basis and says I'm 24 departing, that that made a difference. 25  MR. MEISLER:  Well, I think  I think, Your
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
28 1 Honor, there's a  there's a number of points in there, 2 and to my mind that's a question of how much weight to 3 give the bare facts of the error. 4  Of course the error in this case is you used 5 the wrong range.  And so I think you're  I  from 6 what I understand Your Honor's position to be is that 7 the bare fact of the error, the difference in the range, 8 itself establishes an effect and substantial rights. 9  That's not usually how we do it.  We say you 10 have to look at the particular facts and circumstances 11 in the case.  And I think Your Honor  12  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you  can you give a 13 concrete example of what you mean?  I mean, in my  my 14 intuition is the same as Justice Breyer and 15 Justice Kagan, that if you  if you apply the wrong 16 Guidelines, then there's a reasonable probability that 17 he would have received a lower sentence. 18  But you say he has to show  what would he 19 have to show, concretely?  Give me an example of what is 20 a reasonable probability that he would have received a 21 lower sentence. 22  MR. MEISLER:  Right.  Well, I think there's 23 just two points to that, Justice Ginsburg. 24  One is what the  what the appellate court 25 is going to have before them in every Guidelineserror
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 case, which is the nature and the magnitude of the

29

2 error.  The courts then know is this a careeroffender

3 bump that changes the defendant's offense level and

4 criminal history and could double his range?  Or is it,

5 as in this case, a onelevel movement on  because of a

6 criminal history scoring error that the Sentencing

7 Guidelines, themselves, say you can offset with a

8 departure because it leads to under representation of 

9 of the defendant's recidivist potential.

10  So the court's going to know nature and

11 magnitude.  And by "magnitude" I mean, are we talking

12 one level?  Are we talking 16?  Are we talking nine?

13  So there are going to be many cases.  I

14 don't dispute that.

15  JUSTICE BREYER:  There will be many.  And

16 there are many cases involving rain.  Many.  I mean, I

17 don't know how many thousands, but there are many common

18 facts in thousands of cases where the government itself

19 uses very similar kinds of evidence in order to show

20 that it was really raining.

21  And here, what we're doing is we're using

22 very similar kinds of evidence, namely, that he used the

23 wrong Guideline in order to show that, in fact,

24 better  more probable than not, or pretty probable, or

25 whatever reasonable probability, that it made a

Alderson Court Reporting

1 difference.

Official  Subject to Final Review

30

2  MR. MEISLER:  Well 

3  JUSTICE BREYER:  Say  I mean, it's  I 

4 I don't see this as special.

5  MR. MEISLER:  Well  well, I think it is 

6 it was  it is special, because, of course, it would be

7 the firstever presumption of prejudice that this Court

8 recognizes in 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that's because

10 you're using 

11  JUSTICE BREYER:  The range 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY:   that's because you're

13 using the term "presumption."  You don't have to use the

14 term "presumption."  You can say that this defendant has

15 met his burden of persuasion.

16  We make the assumption here, we  a few of

17 us have practiced under the Guidelines  maybe none of

18 us  that the Guidelines are the beginning point in

19 almost every sentence.  That's the beginning point, not

20 the ending point, but the beginning point.

21  And the question is:  Once this is shown,

22 like, at a minimum, can't you just ask the district

23 judge?  Now, if you want to say that there is sentencing

24 miscalculations in 20 percent of the cases, that they

25 happen all the time, that this is going to burden the

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 courts, I suppose you can make that argument.

31

2  But many circuits, or some circuits at

3 least, have the rule; they just remand it, ask the

4 district judge.

5  MR. MEISLER:  I'm not sure that's how

6 plainerror review has ever been conceived of,

7 Justice Kennedy.  I  I mean, Your Honor asked before,

8 what's our rule?  You know, what is the rule the Court

9 had announced in this case without calling it

10 presumption?  And if the Court wants to opine in this

11 case about what the standard should be, we think the

12 Court could say something such as that a difference in

13 the range, the use of the wrong range, creates some

14 likelihood in every case that the sentence will be

15 different.  But whether that likelihood arises to the

16 required level of a reasonable probability is going to

17 depend on the factors and circumstances.

18  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, haven't we already

19 answered that question in Peugh?  In Peugh, the question

20 was whether the likelihood was going to rise to the

21 level of a significant risk.  And we said yes.  If

22 you're using the wrong range, there is a significant

23 risk that you would have made a different decision.

24  So significant risk actually seems higher to

25 me than reasonable probability.  At least it's not

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 demonstrably lower.

32

2  So I would think that we've already said, if

3 you're using the wrong range because of the anchoring

4 effect of the range  an anchoring effect that is kind

5 of mandatory.  It's  you know, we say that these

6 Guidelines are advisory, but we insist that a judge

7 begin with them.

8  So if you're using the wrong range, there is

9 a significant risk.  I would think so too, a

10 reasonable  of reasonable probability.

11  Why  why  why is there a difference?

12  MR. MEISLER:  I  this  I think there's

13 two points on Peugh, Your Honor.

14  The first one is that Peugh itself, in

15 footnote 8, says that this is a  this is an ex post

16 facto error that implicates constitutional concerns.

17 And the Court said, in their regular Chapman v.

18 California harmlesserror analysis, Petitioner concedes

19 that when it's a nonconstitutional Guidelines error,

20 under Williams v. The United States in Rule 52(a), you

21 do the regular harmlesserror standard.

22  We think it follows from that, that when the

23 error has been forfeited, not preserved, and there's no

24 constitutional concerns, do the regular plainerror

25 analysis.

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1  And I think it 

33

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In regard to  are you

3 telling us that even if there's a significant risk that

4 this sentence was too high, in this case there can be no

5 relief?

6  MR. MEISLER:  Not at all, Your Honor.

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that the government's

8 position?

9  MR. MEISLER:  Not at all, Your Honor.

10  If  if the defendant makes a casespecific

11 showing of a significant risk or a reasonable

12 probability, then the defendant would clear prong three

13 of the 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA:  What the  you think the

15 two are equivalent?  A risk and a probability are  are

16 interchangeable?

17  We're  we're  we're going to change

18 our  our law now, so that plain error is overcome by

19 just a significant risk?

20  MR. MEISLER:  I  I don't  I don't think

21 so, Your Honor.

22  And if I could just 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but  but  but

24 you've accepted it.

25  MR. MEISLER:  Well 

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
34 1  JUSTICE SCALIA:  You seem to say that 2 significant risk and reasonable probability are one and 3 the same.  I don't think they're one and the same at 4 all. 5  MR. MEISLER:  This was going to be the 6 second part of my answer to Justice Kagan, which I 7 actually think that the  framing it in terms of risk, 8 looking at how Peugh analyzed the issue actually lines 9 up almost exactly with how this Court handled the error 10 at issue in Marcus, Marcus in 2010.  Marcus was about 11 whether a defendant had been improperly convicted in 12 violation of the due process clause based on 13 preenactment conduct. 14  And this Court said the risk that's going to 15 happen can be ameliorated by certain things that a judge 16 does, but that risk is going to vary by case.  And the 17 Court said in that situation where there's a risk and it 18 varies, we're going to hold  require a regular  the 19 regular individual showing of prejudice.  Now  20  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, does that 21 individual showing, can it be made on the basis purely 22 of the mistake in the Guidelines, there is no extraneous 23 evidence?  If you have a case where the erroneous range 24 is 20 to 40 and the judge gives 20, and the correct 25 range is zero to 20, is that a case in which the
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 defendant has established plain error?

35

2  MR. MEISLER:  With the caveat that we'd want

3 to know a little bit more about the  the facts and

4 circumstances.

5  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't want to know

6 anything more about it because if the judge is within

7 the Guidelines, he doesn't have to say anything more

8 about it.

9  MR. MEISLER:  I think, Your Honor, if that's

10 all you knew, if it was truly  it's all you knew, I

11 would say that the defendant probably has  has met his

12 burden in that case.

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So now let's

14 say  I mean, this is why the problem is  is 

15 whether you want to call it a presumption or whatever,

16 is so difficult.  What if the Guideline was 20 to  to

17 40 and the judge said 30, and the correct Guideline was

18 zero to 30?  In other words, he's half in the middle of

19 the wrong one.  Do you say, well, maybe it's an error,

20 maybe it's not?  What  what in that case?

21  MR. MEISLER:  I think I can give you a

22 concrete answer without knowing more about the facts and

23 circumstances.  And that's not  that's not 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's  that's why

25 I don't understand why it's one answer, zero to 20 and

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
36 1 20 to 40, and another answer when it's zero to 30 and 20 2 to  when it's halfway as opposed to just at the 3 bottom. 4  MR. MEISLER:  Right.  Well, I think, Your 5 Honor, the Court was faced with a similar situation in 6 the Davila case from a couple terms ago, where the 7 Respondent in that case had argued that  and that 8 was  that involved judicial participation and plea 9 discussions.  And the respondent in that case argued, 10 well, the courts of appeals are just finding all these 11 prejudicial and reversing them anyway.  Don't bother 12 doing cases if they're prejudiced.  Let's come up with 13 an automatic reversal rule. 14  And this Court said no.  It said serious 15 errors are going to be corrected on plain and 16 harmlesserror review, but do a full record assessment 17 in each case.  And that's really all we're asking the 18 Court to  to say here is fullrecord assessment like 19 in Davila  20  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But in  in most 21 Sentencing Guidelines cases, certainly in this case, the 22 judge says nothing.  He's told the probation office said 23 these are the Guidelines, and the judge says, okay.  I 24 sentence him at the bottom, period.  Doesn't explain 25 why.  And there's got to be many, many Guidelines cases
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
37 1 where that's exactly what happens.  The judge doesn't 2 explain it.  We have told the judge he doesn't need to 3 explain it if he sentences within the Guidelines. 4  So what do you do with what I think must be 5 the bulk of the cases where the judge just sentences 6 within the Guidelines and says nothing one way or 7 another to explain it? 8  MR. MEISLER:  Well, I'm not sure, Your 9 Honor, that's the bulk of the cases.  If  10  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you would agree that 11 at least there are many cases where the judge just 12 sentences within the Guidelines. 13  MR. MEISLER:  There are many cases, but I 14 think you run into the same problem as in Davila.  You'd 15 run into a problem of categorization.  Are we going 16 to  are we going to change the entire framework, 17 change the rules that we use in plain and 18 harmlesserror cases  19  JUSTICE BREYER:  We're not changing  well, 20 you've heard the argument.  But I suspect  and you  21 you may know this empirical point better  I think 22 there probably are a lot of cases where the issue is the 23 sentence.  And the appeal will be  include something 24 like this.  In some subset, there will be a plainerror 25 question.  And all you'll really have is what the judge
Alderson Court Reporting

1 did.

Official  Subject to Final Review

38

2  Now, of course, if the government has more,

3 all you would be saying is that this, in and of itself,

4 shows a risk in this circumstance, the reasonable

5 probability, whatever standard you're using.  Of course

6 the government's free to show that there is something

7 different about this.  It wasn't harmful.  It might have

8 been the window washer, you know?  And the government is

9 free to show that.

10  MR. MEISLER:  But 

11  JUSTICE BREYER:  So why is this so

12 difficult?

13  MR. MEISLER:  It's important, Justice

14 Breyer, to recognize  as I understand your  your 

15 what you've posited, that is a shift in the risk,

16 whether you call it the risk of nonpersuasion.

17  JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you know, you 

18  MR. MEISLER:  Absent the government coming

19 forward with something else, the defendant wins.  That's

20 the exact opposite of what usually happens in the

21 prong 

22  JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you're saying it's a

23 shift in the risk.  The government has the burden of

24 proving that it was raining.  It's not a shift in the

25 risk to say that the evidence that I've mentioned proves

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
39 1 rain, and it's not a shift in the risk to say that the 2 defendant can come in and show it was the window washer. 3 The question is whether the burden, which lies with the 4 defendant, is satisfied if all there is is that the 5 judge applied the wrong Guideline. 6  And given the continuous statement in case 7 after case in this Court, that, of course, judges, 8 whether they apply the Guideline or depart, the 9 Guidelines play a significant part in the  in the 10 sentence that occurs.  If all you have is that, you've 11 satisfied the substantial  whatever it is, you know. 12 What is it called?  The substantial  13  MR. MEISLER:  I think it does matter what it 14 is, Justice Breyer. 15  JUSTICE BREYER:  Of course it matters what 16 it is. 17  MR. MEISLER:  It matters what it is.  It's 18 reasonable probability  it's reasonable probability of 19 a lower sentence. 20  JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, it doesn't say that 21 in Olano.  It says  it says in Olano  22  MR. MEISLER:  But  23  JUSTICE BREYER:   in Rule 52(b)  24  MR. MEISLER:  Yeah, substantial  that the 25 substantial 
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
40 1  JUSTICE BREYER:  It says "a plain error that 2 affects substantial rights."  And if it is the case, 3 factually, as this Court has said it is, that applying 4 the Guideline that you apply makes a difference to the 5 sentence, that does affect substantial rights.  He's 6 just borne the burden of proof by showing that.  That  7 I don't see why that's different than any other problem 8 of proof. 9  MR. MEISLER:  I think it's quite different, 10 Your Honor.  And if I could use the example of this 11 Court's decision in Puckett v. United States, this Court 12 has already spoken to how plain error works in one very 13 serious sentencing error, the government's breach of a 14 Guidelinesrelated plea promise at sentencing in 15 Puckett.  And the Court said, not just, you do plain 16 error; it works in the usual way.  Because procedural 17 errors at sentencing  and the Court cited as an 18 example, a misapplication of the career offender 19 Guideline  because procedural error at sentencing is 20 amenable to harmlessnesserror review.  And so we're 21 going to hold the defendant to his usual burden because 22 it's Rule 52(b), not 52(a). 23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Don't you usually  24 don't you usually have a plea colloquy or something in 25 the record in those types of cases?
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
41 1  MR. MEISLER:  You do.  It's just that you 2 have a sentencing  3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, no.  If it's 4  the sentence is within the Guidelines, the judge 5 doesn't have to say anything at all.  So it's very 6 difficult for the defendant to go back and say, here's 7 what the error was even though there's also a clear 8 error, a plain error in what the original calculation 9 was. 10  MR. MEISLER:  I do want to dispute one other 11  I think the key factual premise there.  It's not that 12 the judge said nothing at all.  Depending on the spread 13 of the range, by statute, the judge is required, this 14 Court's decision in Rita requires that if the defendant 15 makes a nonfrivolous request for a variance and the 16 judge is choosing the Guidelines range, agreeing with 17 the Commission's recommendation, instead of giving that 18 nonGuideline sentence, the judge has to explain that as 19 well. 20  JUSTICE ALITO:  If we  if we accept the  21 the proposition that in every case in which there is an 22 incorrect identification of the Guidelines at the time 23 of sentencing there has to be a remand, unless the 24 government can prove with some sort of evidence that it 25 was harmless, would there be any difference between the

42 1 standard in a case where there was an objection and a 2 case where there was no objection? 3  MR. MEISLER:  Not on prong three, Your 4 Honor, as far as I can tell.  The Petitioner's briefs 5 have been a little bit less than clear on what exactly 6 he thinks the government's burden is, but I heard him 7 say today and I believe the citations at page 47 of his 8 brief also indicate that the standard would be the 9 Williams v. United States harmlesserror standard.  The 10 government would have to show no effect on the sentence. 11 It has to persuade the court of appeals the sentence 12 would have been the same absent the error. 13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But these  14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but there are 15 the other factors under the Olano test. 16  MR. MEISLER:  There are, Your Honor.  I  I 17 would agree that  that prong two does some work in 18 these cases, not as much in other settings because 19 courts of appeals look at the plain language of the 20 Guidelines and the application notes and believe that 21 this follows from those  that language. 22  And more importantly on prong four, which 23 Mr. Crooks mentioned earlier, he  he would not embrace 24 the Fifth Circuit's application of kind of a 25 factintensive, casespecific prong four analysis.  And

43 1 the two courts of appeals that have adopted presumptions 2 of prejudice on the Guidelines issue have both either  3 well, the Tenth Circuit explicitly, it says, we presume 4 at prong four as well.  So I think it's very unclear 5 whether prong four will do any work in these cases. 6  One other thing I want to mention about 7 these court  8  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  To the extent that our 9 decision is influenced by our considerations of what 10 kind of a burden, say the Petitioner's proposed rule 11 would put on the resources of the Court, is there 12 anything we can look to or can you or your cocounsel or 13 your colleague for the Petitioner tell us how often 14 Sentencing Guidelines occur in 20 percent of the cases, 15 5 percent of the cases?  And when they do, is it that 16 disruptive to ask the district court, what would you do? 17 Remand. 18  MR. MEISLER:  A couple points.  On the 19 statistics, I believe they're collected in footnote 14 20 of Petitioner's brief, and there are something like 21 4,500 procedural sentencing appeals; about 2,400 of 22 those are Sentencing Guidelines appeals, and about 20 23 percent of those, or about 480, are reversed. 24  We haven't been able to ascertain how many 25 of those are plainerror cases versus harmlesserror
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
44 1 cases, but it's a substantial number across the judicial 2 districts every year. 3  In terms of the cost, Petitioner's position 4 is that it's less costly than remand for a retrial.  We 5 don't dispute that, but we do think it's not costless. 6 The en banc Third Circuit, in a recent procedural 7 sentencing error case, it reached  explained it's not 8 costless at all.  You have to reconvene the parties, the 9 judge, and a very busy  especially in  in Texas, a 10 very busy district court calendar has to find a spot, 11 reconvene the parties, transport a defendant from a 12 distant location. 13  And then, of course, we've collected in the 14 appendix to our brief, situations where the remand for 15 resentencing generates another round of appeals. 16  JUSTICE BREYER:  What you have not put in 17 your brief, I don't think, is that they have, in several 18 circuits, created a system where there is a limited 19 remand for purposes of finding out just what the judge 20 thought about it.  That's not perfect, but it seems to 21 be workable and not quite as expensive. 22  But I think the real difference between us, 23 in  and you can  I'm raising this because I haven't 24 seen a reason you shouldn't address it squarely  is I 25 don't think this is a Rule 52(b) case.  You see?
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
45 1  It's not about how to interpret Rule 52(b), 2 or 52(a), or Olano.  It's a case about Guidelines.  It 3 is a case about what the Guidelines are and how they 4 affect a sentence.  And once we work that out, the 5 answer will be obvious, because I'm not going to 6 disagree with your interpretation of Olano or 52.  But I 7 am going to disagree about what you think the effect of 8 failing to apply the right Guideline is in the mine run 9 of cases. 10  And once  if you agreed with me about 11 that, this case would be over; or if I agreed with you. 12 Between us, we'd end it.  But that  that's  so 13 that's  that  that's where the  I mean, the  the 14 others might have some views, too. 15  (Laughter). 16  But  but do you see  do  do you see  17 do you see why I'm  do you see why I keep pushing you 18 in that direction? 19  MR. MEISLER:  I  I do, Your Honor.  And I 20  and I understand the point.  I guess the  the way 21 I'd try to breech the gap between, perhaps, our 22 positions is  is to recognize and to argue Rule 52(b) 23 is a capacious entire record, fullrecord inquiry.  And 24 I think it leaves room; it accommodates judges' 25 intuitions about how likely given errors are to have an
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 effect in certain cases.

46

2  And so our  our basic position here, most

3 fundamental position is don't blow up the Rule 52(b)

4 framework.  Don't blow up the Rule 52 framework this

5 Court has applied in a number of cases and create, I

6 think, two major problems.

7  One is the anomaly I mentioned with Puckett,

8 earlier.  You're going to have courts saying, Well, the

9 Supreme Court in Puckett said one kind of sentencing

10 error doesn't get a presumption to the usual one, but

11 it's a different kind of sentencing error in

12 MolinaMartinez, gets a different kind of treatment.

13 That's a problem.

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I see  I see 

15  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does it matter  does it

16 matter that this kind of error is never strategic?  This

17 is not an objection that a lawyer would deliberately

18 hold back.  This is a  a lawyer making a mistake by

19 relying on what the probation officer said.  I mean,

20 there is practically heavy reliance on that presentence

21 report.

22  MR. MEISLER:  I think the issue,

23 Justice Ginsburg, is really incentives at the margins,

24 right, that in these kind of cases it's one  and

25 that's what both Dominguez Benitez and Puckett say.  We

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
1 want to incentivize lawyers to make these.

47

2  And if, indeed, the prong three inquiry ends

3 up being no different, the defendant's burden ends up

4 being no different in this cost of cases under plain

5 error than harmless error, it is marginally reducing the

6 incentives 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You know, so much of

8 this is the use of that word "assumptions,"

9 "presumptions"; but both sides are doing it.  This case

10 came up because the Third Circuit has a presumption that

11 if a corrected  it  it says it:  We assume that if

12 Guidelines overlap, the wrong Guideline and the right

13 Guideline overlap, that there is no way  we assume

14 there's no way you can prove error, or that it affected

15 substantial rights.  And there are a number of circuits

16 who have said that.  Overlapping Guidelines, you can

17 never prove.

18  That  that seems that that's an assumption

19 that's wrong, under your articulation of plainerror

20 review.

21  MR. MEISLER:  If that's what the Fifth

22 Circuit were doing, I  I would agree with Your Honor.

23 We don't think there should be a presumption either way.

24  I think the Fifth Circuit has  as other

25 have  circuits have  have treated overlappingrange

Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
48 1 cases a bit differently and have suggested that in those 2 cases, because the judge's sentence still aligns with 3 the Commission's recommendation, we're just going to 4 require a bit more.  I think what the Fifth Circuit has 5 looked for is something more concrete that moves the 6 dial from  7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So let's go to 8 Justice Alito's point.  The more concrete here is that 9 the parties were fighting about extremes.  Sentence him, 10 the government said, to the high end.  The defendant was 11 arguing he's entitled to the low end.  There is some 12 additional proof there.  The judge picks the low end. 13  If the Guideline is an anchor, which I think 14 is almost undisputed, isn't that enough to say it 15 affected substantial rights? 16  MR. MEISLER:  We don't think so in this 17 case.  I  I would make two points:  One is we're not 18 abandoning our position that this factspecific issue is 19 not properly before the Court.  We would urge the Court 20 to take a close look at Fry v. Pliler, which involved 21 very similar circumstances. 22  But on the merits, I think there are really 23  both sides can point to kind of two factors in their 24 favor on the  on the plainerror issue.  The defendant 25 can point to the factors that Your Honor mentioned.  I
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
49 1 think on our side is the overlap in the range and the 2 nature of the error here. 3  This is an error that can seem kind of 4 abstruse.  It's the  it's because of the happenstance 5 of when arrests and sentencing were sequenced.  The 6 defendant has two criminal  two recent felony 7 convictions that aren't counted at all, just drop out of 8 the calculation.  And the Commission realized that could 9 happen in these cases, and so put in, not just a general 10 departure note, but a  a specific application note 11 recommending a departure in this kind of a case when 12 this kind of underrepresentation  13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Except the judge  14  MR. MEISLER:   happens. 15  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   knew that he could 16 have departed upwards under the old Guideline, because 17 this criminal history was pretty serious.  You argued he 18 was entitled to the  to the  and should sentence at 19 the upper end, and yet the judge sentenced him at the 20 low end.  So the  the criminal history has less effect 21 on the judge than it has on you, or perhaps on me. 22  MR. MEISLER:  Right.  Well, I think that 23 maybe that's true, Your Honor.  I  I guess I would 24 just say that I think these are all factors.  And that 25 if we're looking at casespecific determination here, I
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
50 1 think the court of appeals could reasonably conclude, 2 kind of balancing those four facts I mentioned, that the 3 defendant had shown a possibility, no doubt, of a low 4 sentence.  I think it's a close case, but not a 5 reasonable probability. 6  The last point I wanted to make, Your Honor, 7 was just that we mentioned the courts' of appeals 8 experience in this point.  And I think it's useful to 9 look at what happened in the Third Circuit in terms of 10 whether this kind of presumption could be confined to 11 the Sentencing Guidelines. 12  In 2001, the Third Circuit, a decision 13 called Adams, first announced it was going to presume 14 prejudice for the denial of allocution, denial of a 15 defendant's right to allocute at sentencing.  A few 16 months later, it adopted  relied on Adams to find a 17 presumption of prejudice for Sentencing Guidelines 18 errors.  The next year it applied those precedents to 19 find a presumption of prejudice for constructive 20 amendments to indictments.  And in 2005, when Booker 21 came down from this Court, it then applied those 22 precedents to find a presumption of prejudice for Booker 23 error for sentencing under mandatory Sentencing 24 Guidelines. 25  I think it's going to be very difficult to
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
51 1 confine this.  Mr. Crooks makes the point in his reply 2 brief that the courts of appeals have been relatively 3 restrained in finding errors.  One can debate that, but 4 I think the point is that this Court endorses the 5 presumption of prejudice for the first time.  I think 6 it's highly unlikely it's going to stay just in the 7 Guidelines context, just because of the anchoring effect 8 that the Court recognized in Peugh. 9  And if there are no questions, we'd ask that 10 the judgment be affirmed. 11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 12  Mr. Crooks, you have four minutes remaining. 13  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY CROOKS 14  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 15  MR. CROOKS:  With respect to Justice 16 Kennedy's question about the burden on the district 17 courts of resentencings, we would point out that several 18 lower courts in opinions we cited in the brief have 19 pointed out that a resentencing is not all that 20 burdensome, especially in light of the benefits of 21 assuring that defendants are not serving more prison 22 time than the district court wanted them to do. 23  I did also want to address the government's 24 point about  the government touched on the issue of 25 overlapping ranges versus ranges that don't overlap.
Alderson Court Reporting

Official  Subject to Final Review
52 1 And we just wanted to point out that the effect of the 2 Guidelines is the same, regardless of whether the 3 correct and incorrect ranges overlap or not.  It's 4 simply that the degree of the error, the amount of 5 excess imprisonment that is produced, will be different. 6 It will be lower in the case of an overlapping range. 7 But as this Court said in Glover v. United States, any 8 extra amount of imprisonment affects substantial rights. 9  Finally, I just wanted to say that the 10 courts of appeals have overwhelmingly recognized, 11 whether you call it a presumption or not, that it is 12 warranted to find that a change in the Guideline range 13 affected a defendant's substantial rights because of the 14 extreme likelihood that a Guidelinerange error will 15 skew the sentence. 16  And the lower courts have found, in their 17 experience, that it's necessary to make that inference 18 because of the great difficulty in the typical case of 19 showing a casespecific effect of the type that the 20 government is arguing for here. 21  And these two factors mean that this 22 inference or presumption, whatever it's termed, is 23 necessary to avoid, in many cases, the injustice of 24 excess imprisonment. 25  And it will not blow up Rule 52(b), as the
Alderson Court Reporting

53 1 government warns.  It's a modest tweak to one prong of
 2
 the rule that will help the rule serve its basic purpose 3 of fairness.
 4
  And for these reasons, we ask that the Court 5 reverse the judgment below and remand for further 6 proceeding. 7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 8 The case is submitted. 9  (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the 10 aboveentitled matter was submitted.) 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
