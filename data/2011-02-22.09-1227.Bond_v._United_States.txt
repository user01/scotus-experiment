1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:19 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument first this morning in No. 09-1227, Bond v. 5 United States. 6 Mr. Clement. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 8 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 9 MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 The standing of Petitioner to challenge the 12 constitutionality of the Federal statute under which her 13 liberty is being deprived should not be open to serious 14 question. She clearly satisfies this Court's modern 15 tripartite test for standing. Indeed, it is hard to 16 imagine an injury more particularized or concrete than 17 six years in Federal prison, and the liberty interest 18 she seeks to vindicate is her own, not some third 19 party's. 20 In many ways, I think "standing" is a bit of 21 a misnomer here. Plaintiff is not a plaintiff who seeks 22 to invoke the jurisdiction of a Federal court. She is a 23 defendant who has been hailed into court by a Federal 24 prosecutor. There is no logical reason she should not 25 be able to mount a constitutional attack on the statute

1 that is the basis for the prosecution. 2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do our -- any of our 3 opinions talk about the standing of the defendant? I 4 can't think of one at the moment. 5 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think it was in the 6 habeas context, but the Spencer decision does talk about 7 how, when you have a criminal defendant or somebody who 8 is serving a sentence, their standing to challenge the 9 conviction is essentially one of the easiest standing 10 cases you can imagine. And I think in a sense, the same 11 principles would apply here. 12 But as I said, I think standing is normally 13 something you think about as applying to the plaintiff, 14 who is invoking the jurisdiction of the court. So 15 what's really at issue here is something -- almost more 16 of a bar on somebody's ability to make an argument that 17 would vindicate their liberty, and I see no reason why, 18 in logic, that should be the case. 19 Now, the court of appeals essentially didn't 20 apply ordinary - 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it seems to me there 22 are certainly some arguments you could make as a 23 defendant for which you have no standing. You're saying 24 there's no argument you can make as a defendant for 25 which you have no standing?

1 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I'm not sure you would 2 call it normal standing principles, Your Honor. There 3 are certainly arguments you could make that you -- would 4 have no business having anything to do with your case. 5 There's arguments you could make that would have nothing 6 to do with -- would be non-justiciable - 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose I raise an 8 Establishment Clause objection in a matter that -- that 9 does not involve legislation and which our recent 10 opinions say therefore does not violate the 11 Establishment Clause? 12 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I guess I would have to 13 know why you were a defendant in that case and how it 14 had anything to do with the price of tea in that 15 particular case. But - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, you wouldn't. All 17 you -- all you would have to know is that the claim is 18 based upon a statute -- is not based upon a statute and 19 that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence says if it's 20 not based upon a statute, it doesn't violate the 21 Establishment Clause. 22 MR. CLEMENT: With respect, I don't think 23 that follows. I mean, I think if -- if the Federal 24 executive tried to imprison you based on your religion, 25 you could take issue with that and say that's an
5

1 Establishment Clause violation. The problem in your 2 recent case, the Hein case, is the only - 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'd say it's a Free 4 Exercise Clause violation. I don't think you need the 5 Establishment Clause for that. 6 MR. CLEMENT: Well, if they said, well, 7 we're hereby establishing a religion and you're not part 8 of our religion and we're therefore imprisoning you, I 9 would think you could bring that claim. 10 But in all events, bringing it back to the 11 case before you, I think there is no reason to think 12 that ordinary principles of standing wouldn't give my 13 client every ability to challenge the constitutionality 14 of the statute under which she's being held. 15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, in the case 16 before us, are you making any claims other than that 17 Congress was acting outside its enumerated powers in 18 enacting this statute? Are there any peculiarly Tenth 19 Amendment claims that you're making? 20 In other words, you admit that Congress is 21 acting within its enumerated powers and yet the action 22 violates the Tenth Amendment. Are you making any claims 23 of that sort, or are all your claims that the statute 24 here goes beyond Congress's ability to enact it under 25 Article I?

1 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kagan, 2 principally our argument here is an enumerated powers 3 argument. My problem, though, is I'm not sure I 4 understand some clearly defined set of Tenth Amendment 5 claims that are uniquely only Tenth Amendment claims and 6 not enumerated power claims. 7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, let's just use the 8 Printz case and say, even though Congress might have the 9 ability to enact a statute under Article I, there's an 10 independent Tenth Amendment limitation. Do you have any 11 claims of that kind in this case? 12 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't think so, but 13 let me just say that my problem is -- take the Printz 14 case. The Printz case itself went out of its way to say 15 that it was an enumerated power case. In answering an 16 argument in the dissent, the majority opinion says, this 17 is not separate from enumerated powers. If you - 18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, let's assume, 19 Mr. Clement, that there is such a thing as a claim in 20 which you're saying, I can see that this is within 21 Congress's Article I powers, but there is an independent 22 Tenth Amendment limitation on this. Do you have any 23 claims like that? 24 MR. CLEMENT: I don't think so, Justice 25 Kagan, but I'd hate to sort of bet my case that on

1 remand, I'm not going to say something in making an 2 argument that the government or somebody else thinks is 3 too much of a commandeering claim and too much -- not 4 enough of an enumerated power claim. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The government agrees 6 that it's an enumerated power claim in this case. 7 MR. CLEMENT: Again, Justice Ginsburg, that 8 is the basis of our claim. But just to give you a - 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You are -- you are at no 10 risk if the Court were just limited to what both of you 11 agree is involved -- Article I, Section 8 -- and if 12 there is a difference for commandeering claims, when the 13 case arises, we can deal with it. 14 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, you 15 could certainly do that, and as long as it is crystal 16 clear that there will be no obstacle to my client making 17 a constitutional attack on section 229 on remand, I 18 suppose that's fair enough for my client. 19 But one of the arguments we've preserved, 20 for example, is the argument that Missouri vs. Holland 21 is not a blank check for the government, that it 22 requires a balancing of the State's interests against 23 the Federal interests. And if on remand, I wax eloquent 24 about the State's interest in criminal prosecution and 25 law enforcement, I would hate for a trap door to open up

1 at that point and I be told that, wait, wait, that's too 2 much of the State's interest and not enough of your own 3 interest. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you want us to say that 5 when there is a specific injury, specific to your 6 client, that your client has the right to make any 7 argument to show that the government has exceeded its 8 powers under the Constitution, because those powers are 9 limited to protect the liberties of the individual? 10 MR. CLEMENT: Exactly right, Justice 11 Kennedy, and that's the fundamental worry I have here, 12 is that this Court's cases have not drawn a distinction 13 between commandeering claims and enumerated powers 14 claims. The two cases the government points to, New 15 York and Printz, both go out of their way to say that 16 they are mirror images or, in fact, enumerated power 17 claims, because a law that commandeers is not necessary 18 and proper. 19 And I do also think that a part of the 20 problem with the suggestion that somehow Tennessee 21 Electric should be reimagined as a third party standing 22 claim is it fundamentally miscomprehends for whom the 23 structural provisions of the Constitution are there for. 24 Those provisions are there to protect the liberty of 25 citizens.

1 The United -- this Court made that point in 2 the Free Enterprise Fund just last term. There was a 3 case where it wasn't the executive complaining about the 4 infringement on executive power. The Executive Branch 5 ably defended the statute in this Court. It was a 6 disgruntled accounting firm that was allowed to 7 vindicate the separation of powers. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: Can't there be some Tenth 9 Amendment claims that go just to State prerogatives and 10 not to the rights of individuals? Let's say there's a 11 Federal statute that purports to regulate where a State 12 locates its capital, or the -- the contents of a State 13 flag, something like that. Wouldn't that go just to 14 State prerogatives and not to individual rights? 15 MR. CLEMENT: I think it would, Justice 16 Alito. My point is not that there's some special rule 17 for the Tenth Amendment that plaintiffs will always have 18 standing. My point is that you should just apply the 19 normal rules. And what I don't think is sustainable is 20 the proposition that in commandeering claims an 21 individual never has standing. 22 I mean, imagine a Federal statute that 23 purported to save Federal money by commandeering local 24 prosecutors to prosecute Federal crimes. Well, I would 25 hope that a defendant in that kind of case would be able
10

1 to raise a commandeering argument as a defense. I don't 2 think it would be any different if Congress tried to 3 commandeer the Comptroller General to start bringing 4 criminal prosecutions. In that case - 5 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, if you are not 6 making a commandeering claim, then we would be going out 7 of our way to decide that question. And so, you know, 8 are you making a commandeering claim? 9 MR. CLEMENT: I don't -- I don't 10 self-identify as having made a commandeering claim. But 11 what I would say is -- we're not asking you to do 12 anything special. I just think it's the government 13 that's asking you to go out of your way to 14 reconceptualize Tennessee Electric as a different kind 15 of case and preserve it. 16 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the problem is if 17 you're just making a treaty power claim, then how are 18 you going to possibly win on remand in the Third Circuit 19 if we reverse and say that your -- your client has 20 standing? Do you think it falls within the prerogatives 21 of the court of appeals to say that Missouri v. Holland 22 was wrong? 23 MR. CLEMENT: Well two things, Justice 24 Alito. First, this is a technical matter. We could go 25 back to the Third Circuit on our way back to coming here
11
Alderson Reporting Company

1 and we would still have standing to make an argument 2 that it's foreclosed by precedent. 3 But I think it's a mistake to think that 4 Missouri v. Holland is some bright-line rule that 5 forever answers this question. As I read Missouri v. 6 Holland and as we clearly argued before the Third 7 Circuit, it's not a blank check. It's really is more of 8 a balancing test that looks at the State's interest and 9 the Federal interest in assessing whether or not the 10 statute that implements the treaty is necessary and 11 proper. And I think this case compares pretty favorably 12 with Missouri against Holland because there the state's 13 interests was very weak because these birds were just 14 flying through on their way and there was no real State 15 interest, or so this Court held, whereas in this case 16 the State has a real legitimate interest in law 17 enforcement. I also think we ought to be able to make 18 -19 JUSTICE ALITO: Does that depend on the 20 nature of the chemical that's involved? Suppose the 21 chemical was -- was something that people would normally 22 understand as the kind of chemical that would be used in 23 a chemical weapon? Let's say it's Sarin does it matter 24 that this case doesn't involve something like that? 25 MR. CLEMENT: I think it does, Justice
12

1 Alito. I think it would matter in part for a 2 constitutional avoidance statutory construction 3 argument, which I think also ought to be open to us. I 4 sort of think by analogy to the Jones case, where this 5 Court said that a Federal statute about arson doesn't 6 apply when a cousin throws a Molotov cocktail at a 7 residence. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's a merits 9 question rather than a standing question. I assume 10 we're not getting into those merits questions here. 11 MR. CLEMENT: No, I was trying to respond to 12 the question of whether we would be foreclosed. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. But you're 14 confusing me. I thought we were just doing standing. 15 MR. CLEMENT: No, we're not asking you to do 16 more than do standing. But I do think it's important to 17 understand that we don't think we would be limited to 18 just losing on Missouri v. Holland below and coming back 19 up. We think we have a very good argument about 20 Missouri v. Holland as applied. 21 We also think that there is sort of a 22 statutory construction argument. And this isn't sarin. 23 There is something sort of odd about the government's 24 theory that says that I can buy a chemical weapon at 25 Amazon.com. That strikes me as odd, and that seems to
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 me the kind of thing where you could make a statutory 2 construction to say, well, maybe sarin or maybe actual 3 chemical weapons, that's one thing, but with respect to 4 this kind of commonly available chemical, to say without 5 any jurisdictional element or anything like that, that 6 it's a Federal crime seems like an argument we at least 7 ought to have standing to make. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you say about the 9 one thing -- the strongest point against you, I think, 10 is a single sentence in that TVA case. It's only one 11 sentence, but it's there in the opinion, and I think 12 what it's saying, Justice Roberts says, well, he already 13 finished, he just finished saying nobody -- Congress 14 hasn't violated some rule against creating a system of 15 regulation in this statute because it isn't regulation. 16 But then he said, but even if it were, even if it were, 17 and if your complaint was that Congress has acted 18 outside its authority, which they might have thought at 19 that time, in creating a system, TVA, that competes with 20 local systems, even if that were so, the appellants, 21 absent the State or their officers, would have no 22 standing in this suit to raise the question. 23 Okay, now, that -- they put quite a lot on 24 to that. That is what it says. So are we supposed to 25 say, well, that was an ill-considered dicta? Or are we
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 supposed to say it was just wrong? Are we supposed to 2 say the law has changed? What in your view are we 3 supposed to -- or is different. What in your view are 4 we supposed to say? 5 MR. CLEMENT: Could I say two things about 6 that sentence, and then explain what I really think you 7 should say? First of all, the first thing I would say 8 about that sentence is that I don't think, read in the 9 context of the entire opinion, it actually means that 10 the Court is trying to impose a special disability on 11 Tenth Amendment claims, because remember, they have 12 already rejected the plaintiff's basis for having 13 standing. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: So it comes out of left 15 field, and it's an overall "any, even, if." So that 16 suggests it's just dicta and doesn't count. 17 MR. CLEMENT: And it's dictum in another 18 way. But what I think it stands for is the proposition 19 -- it rejects the argument that if you don't otherwise 20 have standing under the governing standing rule of the 21 day that you somehow have a license to bring a Tenth 22 Amendment claim. And if that's what it stands, well, it 23 was right then and it continues to be right. 24 A second point to make about it is it is 25 dictum, and if you read the sentence, what it says is
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the following: It makes a reference to what it's 2 already established a couple of paragraphs earlier, 3 which is the states at issue here have passed laws to 4 accommodate TVA's sale of power, and then it goes on to 5 say, if this were not so. What does that -- that is a 6 counterfactual hypothetical. It's the worst kind of 7 dictum. It says if this were not so. If it were not 8 the fact that the States had already taken these actions 9 to affirmatively accommodate then we would have a 10 different question and then there wouldn't be standing. 11 So it is dictum I think and can be disregarded as such. 12 But really if you ask me what you should do 13 with it, you should do what you did in Twombly, with 14 some language in an opinion that had continued to cause 15 trouble in the 50 years since. You should just say 16 that's no longer good law because it's not. The central 17 holding of Tennessee Electric was overruled 40 years ago 18 in the Camp case, and I think this language is of a 19 piece from that legal interest test, the legal wrong 20 test of standing, and I think this Court should make 21 clear that it doesn't apply any longer, and the virtue 22 of that would be that it would free up the lower courts 23 to decide these Tenth Amendment standing claims based on 24 an application of normal standing principles, because 25 that's not happening in the lower court right now. In
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the lower court right now what happens is somebody comes 2 in with a Tenth Amendment claim of whatever stripe, 3 maybe it's a commandeering claim, maybe it's not, and 4 what they're confronted with, especially if it's a 5 commandeering claim, is a quick citation of Tennessee 6 Electric, an equally quick citation of Shearson which 7 says only this Court can overturn its decisions, and 8 that's it. No standing analysis, nothing subtle about 9 the particular claim. And that's not a sustainable 10 situation. 11 If I could reserve the remainder of my time. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 13 Clement. 14 Mr. Dreeben. 15 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN, 16 FOR RESPONDENT, IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER 17 MR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 18 and may it please the Court: 19 As Petitioner confirmed this morning, the 20 central claim that he is making about the 21 unconstitutionality of section 229 is that it exceeds 22 Congress's enumerated powers. He may wish to raise as 23 part of that claim a argument that it invades the 24 province that belongs to the States concerning criminal 25 law. He can do that. He has the authority to make such
17
Alderson Reporting Company

1 a challenge. The Third Circuit erred in holding to the 2 contrary. 3 Now, the Third Circuit in reaching the 4 contrary conclusion relied on this Court's decision in 5 Tennessee Electric v. TVA, and we think that the court 6 of appeals misread that case in concluding that it 7 barred standing, not because it lacks a holding that 8 does bar standing of certain types of claims that allege 9 an invasion of State sovereignty, but because the kind 10 of claim that Petitioner is making is not a Tenth 11 Amendment reserved rights claim, but instead an 12 enumerated powers claim. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of hard 14 under our precedents to draw that precise line between 15 enumerated powers and the Tenth Amendment, and it seems 16 a bit much to put defendant to the trouble of trying to 17 do that under the theory from TVA that they have no 18 standing to make a particular type of Tenth Amendment 19 claim. 20 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, I don't 21 think that the defendant needs to be put in any trouble 22 in this case because the kind of claim that counsel is 23 making on her behalf does assert her right not to be 24 subject to criminal punishment under a law that he says, 25 counsel says, Congress lacks the authority to enact.

1 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if they argue - 2 what if she argues on remand, if there is a remand, 3 that, assuming for the sake of argument Congress can 4 enact any law that is necessary and proper to implement 5 a treaty? The Tenth Amendment prohibits certain laws 6 that intrude too heavily on State law enforcement 7 prerogatives, State police power. If she makes that 8 argument, which category does that fall into? 9 MR. DREEBEN: It falls into the enumerated 10 powers category, Justice Alito, just as last term in 11 United States v. Comstock one of the elements that this 12 Court looked at when it decided whether the law 13 authorizing civil commitment in that case was within 14 Congress's enumerated authority plus the Necessary and 15 Proper Clause, the Court looked at the extent to which 16 the law accommodated State interests or, alternatively, 17 invaded them in an unlawful manner, which is what Mr. 18 Comstock had alleged in that case. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're -- you want us 20 to say that, even if the defendant in some case might 21 show that a constitutional violation is causing that 22 defendant specific injury, the defendant may not be able 23 to raise the claim of its, what you call sovereignty 24 claim? In Thornton v. Arkansas, the term limits case, 25 we allowed a citizen of a State to bring a challenge to
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 a statute that the State had enacted inconsistent with 2 its Federal powers. Now, that's the flip side. That 3 was a State statute, not a Federal statute, but it seems 4 to me that is inconsistent with the position you're 5 taking. And it seems to me also consistent - 6 inconsistent with the rule that separation of powers 7 claims can be presented by defendants, in Chadha v. 8 INS, Clinton v. New York, a line-item veto case. 9 The whole point of separation of powers, the 10 whole point of federalism, is that it inheres to the 11 individual and his or her right to liberty; and if that 12 is infringed by a criminal conviction or in any other 13 way that causes specific injury, why can't it be raised? 14 I just don't understand your point. 15 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Kennedy, I -- I 16 don't take issue with almost everything that you said. 17 The structural protections of the Constitution can be 18 enforced by individuals under the cases that you have 19 cited. 20 What we are dealing with here is two things. 21 First of all, a statement that this Court made in TVA 22 that was part of its holding, addressed to what the 23 Court perceived as an attack based on a specific aspect 24 of State sovereignty that belonged to the States. Now, 25 today, we might not understand the claim that was made
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 in that case as implicating a specific sovereign right 2 that's protected under the Tenth Amendment. Today we 3 might look at it and say this is nothing other than a 4 conventional preemption claim. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: I don't know whether that's 6 a correct characterization of the argument that was made 7 in -- in the Tennessee Electric case. I -- I'm looking 8 at the brief in the case, and the discussion of the 9 Tenth Amendment generally follows a caption that says 10 the power to dispose of Federal property does not 11 include any power to regulate local activities. 12 I don't understand why that isn't the same 13 kind of delegated powers argument that you say the 14 Petitioner here is raising. 15 MR. DREEBEN: That may be, Justice Alito. I 16 think that it's a little bit difficult to parse 17 precisely what the Petitioner in Tennessee Electric was 18 arguing, but this Court understood the claim as one that 19 -- that bore on Federal regulation of purely local 20 matters in a matter that regulated the internal affairs 21 of the State; and I agree with you that today we might 22 not view that as a Tenth Amendment-specific claim, but 23 this Court did in 1939. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: Why didn't it just consider 25 it as outside the Commerce Clause? I mean, they had a
21
Alderson Reporting Company

1 whole lot of law, but what is the distinction between 2 saying, as they said then, "Court, the TVA regulates 3 electricity rates in Memphis and that's beyond the power 4 of Congress to enact"? 5 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer - 6 JUSTICE BREYER: In this case, which - 7 because of the Tenth Amendment and a lot of other 8 things. 9 MR. DREEBEN: I understand that, Justice 10 Breyer. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: And this case seems the 12 same, saying it's beyond the power of Congress to enact 13 because of the treaty. 14 MR. DREEBEN: Well I think if you intrude 15 today's analytical model - 16 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 17 MR. DREEBEN: -- under today's 18 jurisprudence, that is how the case would be viewed. 19 But it was not how it was viewed at the time of TVA. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: How do we know that? I'm 21 not doubting you; I just want to know. 22 MR. DREEBEN: The language from the 23 sentence, Justice Breyer, that you in fact read - 24 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 25 MR. DREEBEN: -- discussing whether the
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 presence or absence of a State objection mattered, the 2 Court said: As we've seen there's no objection from the 3 State, and if this were not so the appellants, absent 4 the States or their officers, have no standing to raise 5 any objection under the amendment. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume in this 7 hypothetical -- just that case, TVA. State -- the 8 Federal Government sets the price, and someone's accused 9 of violating that price. Can that defendant come in and 10 say, just as in TVA, that's unconstitutional because 11 prices have to be set by the State? Can the defendant 12 say that, or is that an anti- commandeering claim that 13 you say they're barred from raising? 14 MR. DREEBEN: That is not an anti 15 commandeering claim. That is the kind of claim that 16 today we would conceptualize as an enumerated powers 17 claim. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So my question goes back 19 to one that's been asked before, which is, give me a 20 hypothetical of a defendant who has been convicted where 21 it would be a pure anti- commandeering claim that you 22 say they have no standing for. 23 MR. DREEBEN: This will take me back to - 24 to Justice Kennedy's question, because I wanted to 25 answer the part that I thought distinguished a
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 commandeering case from what Justice Kennedy was talking 2 about. And the point is best made in the context of an 3 example. Under the Sex Offender Registration Act, 4 defendants have challenged the law on numerous grounds, 5 including, number one, Congress lacks its constitutional 6 authority under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary 7 and Proper Clause to criminalize the individual 8 registration requirement imposed on them. All courts 9 that have addressed that have said that's a claim that's 10 within the cognizance of a defendant to bring. 11 Defendants have also said the SORNA statute 12 violates Federal law because it requires States to 13 accept sex offender registrations. It commandeers the 14 States into requiring them to set up a sex offender 15 database. 16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Dreeben, why 17 shouldn't the defendant be able to raise that argument? 18 If the defendant prevails on that argument, presumably 19 the statute is invalidated and the conviction is 20 overthrown. So why doesn't the defendant have the 21 appropriate interest to raise that argument? 22 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Kagan, this is 23 the absolutely crucial point that distinguishes 24 commandeering from most of the structural constitutional 25 provisions that we've been discussing this morning.

1 State can choose to establish a sex offender database 2 and to receive registrations from people who are 3 required to register under Federal law; and invalidating 4 a Federal law that commanded them to do that does not 5 deprive the State of its ability to say, we want to 6 have, in our autonomous sovereign interest, a sex 7 offender database that will receive these applications, 8 and as a result - 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, all you're saying is 10 that there's -- in that hypothetical is that there's no 11 violation? 12 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct. 13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Everybody goes home. 14 MR. DREEBEN: There -- the reason why in 15 that hypothetical the defendant should not raise the 16 issue is because there will be no violation - 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: But that's a merits 18 question. That's not a standing question. Why don't we 19 just say the defendant has standing to raise it, and 20 then he'll lose? 21 MR. DREEBEN: You could say that, Justice 22 Kagan, but I think that part of the enduring force of 23 TVA is that it adopted a third-party standing rule that 24 is still part of this Court's jurisprudence. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why couldn't you have

1 said the same thing in TVA, that, while companies are - 2 are -- not -- yes, the Federal -- the Federal statute 3 requires the companies to charge this price, but they 4 might have decided to charge it on their own anyway, and 5 therefore you have no standing? 6 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the Court did say that 7 there was no standing on the grounds that when the 8 specific argument was made, this takes away the right of 9 the State to regulate because the Federal Government is 10 regulating. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, is your 12 concern that there would be a clash in these cases? 13 You've given the example of the State wants to have this 14 registration system. Suppose the -- the defendant can 15 raise that and would prevail? Well, the State's not 16 party to that suit, its interests have not been 17 represented. Is that -- is that your concern? 18 MR. DREEBEN: That is a major factor in 19 third-party standing generally, Justice Ginsburg. 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose a State wanted to 21 be commandeered in Printz? Suppose they said, we really 22 like having sheriffs take the Federal gun registration 23 law? 24 MR. DREEBEN: They can do that. Justice 25 Kennedy, there's nothing -

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I have -- I have -- I 2 have serious trouble with that. A State can surrender 3 its -- its -- a State can confer more authority on the 4 Federal Government than the Constitution does? 5 MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Kennedy. But a 6 State in its sovereign decisionmaking process can elect 7 to participate in a Federal program. At least, that was 8 what Justice O'Connor said in her concurrence in Printz. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't standard standing 10 doctrine able to give you the protection that you're 11 looking after? If indeed you can't tell whether the 12 State did it because it was compelled to or because it 13 wanted to, there was no causation and you don't have 14 standing. 15 MR. DREEBEN: That is a perfectly acceptable 16 route of analysis. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would rather use that 18 route of analysis than inventing the new one that you're 19 -- that you're urging upon us. 20 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think they're 21 different, Justice Scalia. They both concern who holds 22 the right and whether there's any redressability - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then let's use the 24 one we already have and -- and not -- not have to get 25 into developing one that I've never heard of before.

1 MR. DREEBEN: I think, Justice Scalia, that 2 all the Government is doing in this case is applying 3 conventional standing principles of redressability and 4 third-party standing in a specific context, which as Mr. 5 Clement has made clear, is not before the Court today. 6 This is not a commandeering case. That happens to be 7 the only specific aspect of a State sovereignty claim 8 that is distinct from an enumerated powers claim that 9 the Court has recognized in recent decades. Whether 10 some other sort of claim of State sovereignty might some 11 day be recognized and require its own analysis is well 12 beyond the scope of this case. Our point is a much more 13 basic one. We agree with Petitioner's counsel that he 14 can raise the claim that he has tried to raise. We 15 think that the Third Circuit misunderstood what the TVA 16 decision purported to say when it rejected standing for 17 a type of State sovereignty claim. And we think that 18 the currently recognized State sovereignty claim of 19 commandeering fits into the description of the 20 analytical category that was addressed in TVA. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that analysis 22 differ in any way because this is a treaty power claim 23 versus a Commerce Clause claim? Your briefs go back and 24 forth on which one it is. Your reply brief now 25 emphasizes Commerce Clause power, but your main brief
28

1 was saying this is a treaty provision challenge. Do 2 they differ? 3 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I 4 believe that the statute is valid under either the 5 Treaty Clause plus the Necessary and Proper Clause 6 analysis under Missouri v. Holland. It also can be 7 sustained in our view under the Commerce Clause, which 8 follows directly from what this Court said in Raich when 9 the Court said that the intrastate regulation of a 10 commodity that's used in commerce is a customary, 11 typical method that Congress utilizes. It gave as 12 examples of that the nuclear, biological, and plastic 13 explosives statutes which were enacted to implement 14 treaty obligations of the United States. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: Given the breadth of this 16 statute, that would be a very far-reaching decision, 17 wouldn't it? Suppose that the Petitioner in this case 18 decided to retaliate against her former friend by 19 pouring a bottle of vinegar in the friend's goldfish 20 bowl. As I read this statute, that would be a violation 21 of this statute, potentially punishable by life 22 imprisonment, wouldn't it? 23 MR. DREEBEN: I'm not sure, Justice Alito. 24 I will assume with you that it is. The statute - 25 JUSTICE ALITO: If she possesses a chemical
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 weapon. 2 MR. DREEBEN: I'm not sure that vinegar is a 3 chemical weapon. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, a chemical weapon is a 5 weapon that includes toxic chemicals. And a toxic 6 chemical is a chemical that can cause death to animals. 7 And pouring vinegar in a goldfish bowl, I believe, will 8 cause death to the goldfish, so that's -- that's a 9 chemical weapon. 10 MR. DREEBEN: I'm willing to make the 11 assumption with you and accept that it is a 12 broad-reaching statute, but it was adopted as a 13 broad-reaching statute because this is an area, like the 14 medical marijuana instance in Raich, where effective 15 control of the interstate market requires control of an 16 intrastate market. The statute exempts peaceful uses 17 for agricultural and pharmaceutical purposes of these 18 chemicals, it has other exemptions as well. It was 19 intended to be a comprehensive ban that implemented the 20 United States treaty obligations to eliminate the use of 21 chemical weapons both in military instances and in 22 terrorism, and - 23 JUSTICE ALITO: The difference is that Raich 24 involved one commodity, right? Marijuana. This 25 involves potentially thousands and thousands of
30

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 chemicals. And you would have -- you would make the 2 same argument with respect to every one of those 3 chemicals if you take together all of the people who are 4 -- who would use vinegar to kill goldfish or all the 5 people who might use antifreeze to kill dogs, you put 6 all of that together, that has a substantial effect on 7 the interstate, the interstate market for antifreeze or 8 for vinegar? That would be the argument? 9 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think it's pretty well 10 recognized, Justice Alito, that when Congress seeks to 11 regulate an interstate market as to which there cannot 12 be any question under the Commerce Clause Congress could 13 do, it can control the interstate market as necessary in 14 order to assure that its prohibition is effective. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're trying to drive 16 vinegar out of the interstate market? Do the people 17 know you're trying to do this? Can you really argue 18 that this statute is designed to drive vinegar out of 19 the interstate market? 20 MR. DREEBEN: No, of course not. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, are we 22 getting to the merits of the case? 23 MR. DREEBEN: A lot further than I had 24 intended, Justice Ginsburg. The merits of the case, 25 though, involve both a Commerce Clause argument, a
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 treaty-based argument. As far as the standing 2 principles go, I don't think that there is any 3 difference between them. Missouri v. Holland was a case 4 in which this Court adjudicated whether a law exceeded 5 Congress's enumerated authority. It did that at the 6 behest of a State, but there is no reason why under 7 cases like Lopez and Sabri and Perez that an enumerated 8 powers argument is in any way off limits to a criminal 9 defendant. It's not. 10 If this case does go back down to the Third 11 Circuit, a petitioner can make the argument that this 12 law exceeds the enumerated powers. We can rely on the 13 Treaty Clause. It doesn't affect standing in any way. 14 I think that the amicus in support of the judgment makes 15 the assumption that because Missouri v. Holland is good 16 law, there's no possible claim that Petitioner can make 17 that the law would exceed Congress's enumerated 18 authority. Therefore, the amicus says this must be some 19 sort of a special State sovereignty claim of a genre 20 that looks like commandeering, perhaps not articulated 21 quite light that. 22 We don't understand Petitioner to be making 23 that argument. I think Petitioner confirmed today 24 that's not what she's trying to do, and there is no 25 Tenth Amendment claim based on a specific aspect of
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 State sovereignty that Petitioner has ever made. In 2 fact, if you look at Petitioner's brief in support of 3 the rehearing petition, Petitioner said the Tenth 4 Amendment argument raised by Bond was not critical to 5 Bond's other constitutional challenges. It is ancillary 6 to Bond's main argument that Congress acted outside of 7 its enumerated powers. I think that's a correct 8 understanding of what Petitioner has sought to argue in 9 the court below. In our view, she is entitled to make 10 that argument. That argument should also fail on the 11 merits, but that is not an issue that this Court granted 12 certiorari to decide. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the category that you 14 would like to have saved, you said commandeering, but 15 you said there conceivably could be others. Is there 16 anything concrete, anything other than commandeering, 17 that might fall under this State sovereignty side of the 18 line? 19 MR. DREEBEN: Well, as Justice Alito pointed 20 out, the Court has indicated that moving a State 21 capital, a direction to move the State capital, might be 22 an intrusion on sovereignty. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Unlikely to come up as a 24 defense in a criminal case. 25 MR. DREEBEN: Highly unlikely.

McALLISTER, 6 AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF 7 JUDGEMENT BELOW 8 MR. McALLISTER: Thank you, Mr. Chief 9 Justice, and may it please the Court: 10 The relevant standing doctrine in this case 11 is the prudential rule against third-party standing. No 12 one disputes here that the Petitioner has Article III 13 standing. One of the difficulties in the case is that 14 the only case that mentions specifically standing in 15 this context is the Tennessee Valley Authority case and 16 it clearly says if it is in fact a Tenth Amendment 17 claim, unless you have a State official or the State, 18 there is no standing. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Pretty harsh, if 20 we're talking about prudential standing, to deny that to 21 a criminal defendant, isn't it? 22 MR. McALLISTER: It's potentially harsh, 23 Your Honor, but there are lower court cases that have 24 certainly done it. There is some circuit cases where a 25 criminal defendant has tried to make a Tenth Amendment
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 claim and the court has said no. She still has several 2 other claims here. We all agree, I think, to the extent 3 you could really characterize her claim as an Article I 4 enumerated powers claim, this Court has assumed many 5 times that defendants have the standing. This Court 6 generally has not discussed it, but it has assumed it, 7 and so there are cases that say no standing for a 8 criminal defendant. She did make a Fifth Amendment due 9 process vagueness challenge. If she had other Bill of 10 Rights type claims. Even the treaty power cases like 11 Reid v. Covert recognize you could raise that kind of 12 claim, but the Court's cases do distinguish between 13 Tenth Amendment and other claims. And a lot of the 14 argument here is about what is on the Tenth Amendment 15 side of the line, what is a lack of power, for a better 16 word, whether it's -- there's an Article I, power 17 doesn't reach it. And in particular I would point to 18 the Heller case, which Petitioner mentions in her reply 19 brief, but frankly is off by one page in the citation 20 that the Court should focus on, pages 579 to '80. The 21 Court says "there are three times in the Constitution 22 where the word "the people" is not talking about 23 individual rights. And the three examples the Court 24 gives are the Preamble, Article 1, Section 2, and the 25 Tenth Amendment. And the Court says these provisions
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 are about reservations of power, not rights. And also 2 the Printz and the New York v. United States cases say 3 there is something substantive about the Tenth Amendment 4 that is a limit separate and apart from Article , 5 Section 8. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. What do you 7 see specifically? Because there's a lot of discussion 8 about labels and what the labels mean in this case. But 9 tell me specifically what -- not the word she uses, but 10 the specific ways in which prudential considerations bar 11 her standing; meaning: What about the nature of her 12 claim prudentially should counsel us against giving her 13 standing? 14 MR. McALLISTER: Well, I would say at least 15 a couple things, Your Honor. One is, the usual rule of 16 prudential third-party standing considers the alignment 17 or lack of alignment between the interests of the third 18 party making the claim and the party who is not present 19 whose claim it really is. And in this case, there's 20 really no argument that her interests align with those 21 of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth 22 in fact prosecuted her and it did not stop her. It was 23 unsuccessful as a deterrent. And later, when local 24 police wouldn't be involved, the Federal Government got 25 involved. And -

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think 2 Pennsylvania would be upset that the Federal Government 3 got her when they couldn't? 4 MR. McALLISTER: No, that's my point. And 5 so my point is that her interests are directly contrary 6 to Pennsylvania's interests. So she's not stepping in 7 saying: I share the interests of the State; therefore, 8 let me articulate and argue the interests of the State. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, in a -- in another 10 case, conceivably, the State Attorney General can 11 exercise his or her prosecutorial discretion not to - 12 not to prosecute this woman, or at least not to 13 prosecute her under the antiterrorism law that gives her 14 8 years. Isn't that something for the State to be 15 concerned about? We want to have the discretion of 16 whether to prosecute or not for standard crimes that 17 have no relation to interstate commerce or any other 18 Federal power. 19 MR. McALLISTER: Well, it's standard that 20 both sovereigns have the ability often to prosecute if 21 the definitions of crimes overlap, and there's nothing 22 that prevents Pennsylvania from prosecuting her again 23 here. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: She wants to make the 25 argument that the definitions don't overlap. She wants
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to make the argument that this is a strictly State, 2 local crime, and that any -- any attempt by the Federal 3 Government to convert it into a treaty-based terrorism 4 crime is -- is erroneous. 5 MR. McALLISTER: Well, in - 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what she's trying to 7 do. Why doesn't she have standing to make that 8 argument? 9 MR. McALLISTER: Because the lower courts, 10 at least, in their defense, understood this to be a 11 Tenth Amendment claim, and there are reasons for that. 12 Now, in this Court neither the Petitioner nor the 13 government really wants to talk about that or argue 14 about that. Instead, they talk about the petition for 15 rehearing en banc after the Third Circuit has decided 16 the case. 17 But if you look in the Joint Appendix, pages 18 26 to 32 is the supplemental brief that her lawyer filed 19 when the Third Circuit said, post-argument: Now, wait a 20 minute, maybe this is a Tenth Amendment case and we have 21 a standing issue. The government, at that point, said: 22 Hey, good idea; we don't think she does have standing. 23 And she did not come back and answer: I'm 24 not making a Tenth Amendment claim. Her answer is: I'm 25 making a Tenth Amendment claim, but I have standing to
38
Alderson Reporting Company

1 make it. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: That single sentence 3 doesn't seem -- I'm trying to figure it out. It doesn't 4 seem to refer to just all Tenth Amendment claims. 5 There's a footnote and it talks about no standing in 6 this suit. 7 Then if you look back at the lower court 8 case, it seemed to be referring to a particular argument 9 where the challengers had said the Property Clause 10 doesn't give authority to the government to pass this. 11 The reply was, that was true in Alabama, and the Court 12 said it was okay. Then the challengers say: Oh, but 13 Alabama agreed. And then Georgia doesn't agree. And it 14 was in that context that Georgia says it doesn't make 15 any difference. 16 But if Georgia was going to disagree or 17 agree, if that's what it turned on, we better have 18 Georgia say whether they agree or disagree, and not have 19 people who aren't Georgia. That's what he seems to be 20 saying to me at the moment. 21 If I'm right, what's comparable to that in 22 this case? Is there some claim that she's making that 23 it would be constitutional if they agreed in the State 24 and it wouldn't be if not? I don't think so. I think 25 she means it's constitutional irrespective.

McALLISTER: Well, I think, again, the 6 sentence -- I mean, if we're talking about the sentence 7 in TVA barring standing in Tenth Amendment claims - 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. It just says "in this 9 case." 10 MR. McALLISTER: It says "in this case," but 11 there's no suggestion that it will -- frankly, it's hard 12 for us to even tell exactly what this case was in terms 13 of the facts. It's a rather confusing case. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: No, he cites. He gives a 15 footnote and you read the page and you get an idea. 16 MR. McALLISTER: For that particular 17 instance -- and that's certainly an example the Court 18 had in mind. The language of TVA, though, is in no way 19 limited to that particular instance. It just says here, 20 there's -- if this is a Tenth Amendment claim, there is 21 no standing. And that's why, I think, for 70 years the 22 lower courts have wrestled with, what is a Tenth 23 Amendment claim? Because TVA is there, this Court has 24 announced it, and if it is a Tenth Amendment claim, 25 there is no standing.

1 Sort of back to Justice Sotomayor's 2 question, though, in terms of the third-party prudential 3 aspect of it, again, the issue is: Is this person a 4 good person to assert someone else's interests? Yes, 5 she has Article III standing, but not necessarily to 6 make every constitutional claim one might think of. In 7 the Tenth Amendment context, those claims belong to the 8 States. They don't create individual rights. And in 9 fact, there's good reason to think the States do get 10 involved when they perceive actual Tenth Amendment 11 violations. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you just 13 articulate for me -- we're speaking in generalities - 14 what in the nature of her claim, taking the labels away, 15 do you think is a pure Tenth Amendment challenge? 16 MR. McALLISTER: Well, that's - 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As I read her complaint, 18 and it's always that it's a Tenth Amendment claim 19 because Congress and the president have exceeded their 20 powers in some - 21 MR. McALLISTER: As I understand her 22 complaint, basically her argument is that unless this 23 statute is authorized by something in Article I, 24 section 8, the first 17 clauses, there's no power to 25 enact it. And that's why this case is, frankly, not

1 clearly governed by Lopez or Raich or Morrison. Those 2 were straight commerce power cases under section 3. 3 This is a treaty power case under Article II, and she 4 only wants to read the first half of the Necessary and 5 Proper Clause, which refers to all the foregoing powers. 6 But it also says necessary and proper for all other 7 powers. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -- you haven't 9 answered my -- my question. Why isn't that a merits 10 decision as to whether or not the President and Congress 11 have the power to enact this legislation? 12 MR. McALLISTER: Well, Your Honor, in 13 essence, at the end of the day, it will be a merits 14 question, but from a standing argument, trying to define 15 what is a Tenth Amendment claim -- and the point I was 16 trying to make, perhaps not successfully, is that she's 17 not saying -- well, she is sort of saying the Article I, 18 section 8 enumerated powers are the limits. But 19 frankly, they can't be the limits. 20 In light of the plain language of the 21 Necessary and Proper Clause and Missouri v. Holland and 22 90 years of this Court's precedent under the treaty 23 power, those powers are not limits. So she's asserting 24 they're limits and saying, I'm really making an Article 25 I claim, but that simply lets her always have standing,

1 because, even in the commandeering cases, the plaintiff 2 can say, this is about Article I, this is not about the 3 Tenth Amendment. And so at some point the Court has to 4 drill down and characterize what the nature of the claim 5 actually is. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why do we have 7 to do that? It -- it seems to me we've had a lot of 8 discussion this morning about whether this is an 9 enumerated powers claim or a Tenth Amendment claim. 10 They really do kind of blend together, and it seems to 11 me awfully difficult to put on a criminal defendant the 12 responsibility to decide whether this is going to be an 13 enumerated powers claim or this is going to be a Tenth 14 Amendment claim. The basic principles do kind of merge 15 together, and why does it make -- again, why does it 16 make that much of a difference and why do you put the 17 burden on the defendant to parse the claim one way or 18 another, since I assume they can make pretty much all 19 the same arguments under an enumerated powers -- under 20 the enumerated powers clause - 21 MR. McALLISTER: Well - 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In an enumerated 23 powers argument. 24 MR. McALLISTER: In an enumerated powers 25 case, yes. The problem -- I think the difficulty with
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 this case is it's unusual and that there -- until its 2 reply brief in this Court, the government had not relied 3 on the commerce power. In fact, the government had said 4 throughout: This is a treaty power case, treaty power 5 case. Even at the oral argument in the Third Circuit, 6 the judge said, couldn't we decide this on the basis of 7 the treaty power? Wouldn't -- or the commerce power - 8 would not that be the easy route? And the government 9 lawyer said, no, that would be the hard route; you need 10 to decide it on the basis of the treaty power. 11 So I agree in a Lopez kind of case that, 12 really, that's where the Court has often said it's just 13 mirror image. If the commerce power doesn't go that 14 far, then by definition it's reserved under the Tenth 15 Amendment. But here, it's a treaty power case. It's 16 not an Article I, section 8 - 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. McAllister, I guess I 18 don't understand why that makes a difference. The 19 Necessary and Proper Clause says "foregoing powers" and 20 it says "other powers." This happens to be a case where 21 Congress is acting under the other powers part of the 22 Necessary and Proper Clause, but the question in either 23 event is the extent of the Necessary and Proper Clause 24 and what it allows Congress to do. 25 So in -- in that sense, whether it's a
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 treaty power case or not a treaty power case just 2 doesn't matter. It's all a question of what Congress's 3 scope of authority is under the Necessary and Proper 4 Clause. 5 MR. McALLISTER: Well, I would disagree 6 somewhat, Your Honor, respectfully, that -- her argument 7 about the Necessary and Proper Clause I don't think is 8 that this -- this -- she's not arguing the statute is an 9 irrational or unreasonable way to implement the treaty 10 obligations of the United States. What she's arguing is 11 that the treaty power itself does not give Congress the 12 power to enact section 229 unless, in essence, you don't 13 need the treaty, because you already have the power, the 14 government does, under the first 17 clauses of Article 15 I, Section 8. 16 So, yes, the Necessary and Proper Clause is 17 the connection here to Article I, Section 8, but it's a 18 minimal connection, and -- and she's not arguing sort of 19 the -- - the -- I don't think, the Comstock kind of 20 argument that this isn't tied to, rationally, to some 21 sort of articulated power. 22 The government clearly has power to enter 23 treaties under Article II, section 2, and so that to me 24 is the distinguishing feature from all those other 25 Article I, section 8, cases.

Are you saying 7 that -- that she is arguing that Congress does not have 8 the power to enact legislation that's necessary and 9 proper for the implementation of treaties, but only for 10 the making of treaties; that she's making that argument 11 that's been made by some academic writers? 12 MR. McALLISTER: No, I'm not sure that's 13 what I meant to say, Justice Alito.

It's one step removed, but it is a challenge to 17 the treaty power, because she says the statute has to be 18 based on something in Article I, section 8, first 17 19 clauses; and if it's based on something there, then the 20 treaty power adds nothing to Congress's ability to enact 21 legislation; and that's inconsistent with the plain 22 language of the Necessary and Proper Clause, the fact 23 that the treaty power is in Article II, not in Article 24 I, section 8. 25 And so under her view of the world -- as I
46

1 understand it; I'm sure Mr. Clement will correct me if 2 I'm wrong about my understanding -- is that really you 3 don't need a treaty, the treaty doesn't add anything. I 4 mean, it may be the reason that Congress decides at this 5 point in time to enact section 229. But I believe, as I 6 understood her argument, if it has the commerce power to 7 do it, United States never entered -- needed to enter a 8 treaty in order for Congress to enact section 229. So 9 in other words, as I understand her argument, the treaty 10 power adds nothing to the domestic legislative authority 11 of Congress. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McAllister, have you 13 found any case other than this one where a criminal 14 defendant was held to have lacked standing to challenge 15 a statute under which the defendant was prosecuted? 16 MR. McALLISTER: Not in this Court, Justice 17 Ginsburg, but there are examples in the circuits, a few. 18 There are examples from the Eighth Circuit, from the 19 Tenth Circuit involving criminal prosecutions where the 20 Court characterized the claim as a Tenth Amendment claim 21 and said, in light of TVA, the criminal defendant does 22 not have standing to make that claim. So there are 23 examples in the lower courts. I'm not aware of an 24 example in this Court. 25 And I would say this, too, about the -
47
Alderson Reporting Company

1 there's some argument about the separation of powers 2 cases in which the Court has typically allowed 3 individuals to make that claim. Again, because we're 4 talking about prudential rules and third-party standing, 5 or at least I'm talking about that, one prudential 6 consideration is in those cases, whether it's Chadha, 7 whether it's Clinton v. New York, the recent Free 8 Enterprise case, the Federal Government is always very 9 much present. It may be representing the defendant in 10 those cases, it may simply intervene or come in as an 11 amicus, it gets notice if the Federal statute is 12 challenged as being unconstitutional. 13 The difference in the Tenth Amendment 14 setting is there's no mechanism, practically, to notify 15 the States or solicit the States for their interests. 16 Someone's raising this claim that says the government is 17 intruding on your sovereign interests; there's no 18 mechanism to allow the States. Now, if -- if States are 19 aware of it and come and ask to file an amicus, perhaps 20 they would be allowed to, but there's no mechanism that 21 ensures - 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that an issue for 23 a civil lawsuit as opposed to a criminal one? Because 24 all that would happen in a criminal suit is that the 25 defendant's conviction would be undone, but that doesn't
48

1 mean that the State is bound in some way. The State 2 wasn't a party to the criminal action. 3 MR. McALLISTER: Well, the State isn't a 4 party, but what gets said in those cases about the scope 5 of the State's prerogatives vis--vis the Federal 6 Government could well be brought to bear in other cases 7 in other settings, commandeering cases. 8 Again, the concern in the third-party 9 standing case is that you're not actually a party, but 10 someone else is making arguments in a sense on your 11 behalf. They lose, because perhaps they don't know all 12 of the arguments they should be making or they don't 13 articulate them the way the State does -- there's still 14 stare decisis effect of those decisions on the States. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there's two things 16 that could happen. One is that if the State loses, then 17 -- and it doesn't want to lose -- it passes its own law. 18 Or if it wins, if the case is as stated below, it just 19 lets the status quo go. I still don't understand what 20 the long-term injury to the State is or could be. 21 MR. McALLISTER: Well, I guess again, and 22 maybe I'm misapprehending, but the long-term interest is 23 a -- is a decision, say in the criminal case, that says, 24 no, this doesn't intrude on the State's sovereignty, is 25 there as a matter of stare decisis. So if in a later
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 case the State wants to in fact assert that this 2 particular statute does intrude on our sovereignty, it's 3 not that they can't necessarily raise the claim, but 4 they will confront contrary precedent that the State 5 never had a chance to -- to voice its opinion or its 6 views at the time the issue was being adjudicated. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your underlying premise is 8 that the individual has no interest in whether or not 9 the State has surrendered its powers to the Federal 10 Government, and I just don't think the Constitution was 11 framed on that theory. 12 MR. McALLISTER: Well, Justice Kennedy, I 13 don't know that I would say they have no interest, but I 14 am -- I guess the premise I'm asserting is they do not 15 necessarily get to assert the Tenth Amendment claim of 16 the States. New York v. United States, for example, was 17 a case where the State initially said we're not 18 concerned about this regulation, and then changed its 19 mind; and the Court in New York said States don't waive 20 those Tenth Amendment rights; States can then -- can 21 change its mind and bring a suit, and there's no 22 indication - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it does -- it does 24 assume, as Justice Kennedy said, that the reason that is 25 there in the Constitution is only for the benefits of
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the States, and not for the benefit of the people in the 2 States. So if a State chooses to give it away, the - 3 the individual has -- has no standing. You say it's 4 third party, we're raising the States' rights. I think 5 what the other sides is arguing; this is not a right of 6 the States, it's a right of the individual to have the 7 State take charge of certain matters and the Federal 8 Government take charge of other matters. I don't see 9 why that's any different from an Article I, section 8 10 claim. 11 MR. McALLISTER: Well, and that's a 12 conclusion the Court can reach. But what -- what the 13 Petitioner's position essentially holds is that there's 14 never a question of third-party standing for any claim 15 under the Constitution, basically, not the kind I'm 16 talking about; and that no claims are limited to certain 17 categories of litigants. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: There -- there's a question 19 of causality, so some of them will -- will not be valid 20 because you can't show that the -- that the State was 21 coerced into doing something and therefore you can't 22 show that the violation of the Constitution caused your 23 injury. 24 MR. McALLISTER: And that's -- but you're 25 talking now really the causality; that's an Article III
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 inquiry. And again, what I'm trying to talk about is 2 separate, the next step, the prudential third-party 3 standing. And I think Petitioner's view is third-party 4 standing is just out the window, whether it's separation 5 of powers, Tenth Amendment, anything. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 7 McAllister. 8 MR. McALLISTER: Thank you. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Clement, you 10 have four minutes remaining. 11 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 12 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 13 MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 14 Just a few points in rebuttal. First of 15 all, one reason not to carve out a special rule for 16 commandeering claims is that not all commandeering 17 claims are created equal. Mr. Dreeben raises the 18 commandeering claim that has been litigated in the 19 context of SORNA, the sex registration act. I don't 20 know the details of that enough to know whether that's a 21 valid commandeering claim or not, or whether there's a 22 redressability problem in that particular case. But I 23 can certainly imagine a commandeering case, a Federal 24 statute that purports to commandeer local prosecutors to 25 prosecute Federal crimes, where there would be no
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 standing obstacle; and the problem is right now the 2 lower courts aren't resolving the standing issue in the 3 SORNA challenges based on a careful analysis of Article 4 III standing, redressability or prudential standing, for 5 that matter. They're resolving those challenges with a 6 simple citation to Tennessee Electric and let's move on, 7 and that's really what should stop. 8 A second reason that you should not try to 9 carve out commandeering cases as being somehow the 10 residuum of the Tennessee Electric dictum is because 11 Tennessee Electric says nothing about commandeering 12 cases. It just talks broadly about Tenth Amendment 13 cases. You know, we can disagree or agree; it's kind of 14 hard to figure out what the nature of the claim was in 15 Tennessee Electric. 16 I don't think it was really much different 17 from the claim that we're raising here, which is in 18 Tennessee Electric they said, well, if the Federal 19 Government gets to regulate power, what's left of 20 State's traditional prerogative to regulate the price 21 for power. 22 Here is if the Federal Government can go in 23 and prosecute you for putting vinegar in your neighbor's 24 goldfish bowl, what's left of local law enforcement. I 25 think they're very similar arguments. But whatever else
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 is true, I just don't think Tennessee Electric limited 2 itself to commandeering claims in any way that would 3 allow you to say that Mr. Dreeben refers to the enduring 4 force of Tennessee Electric. With all due respect, I 5 don't think Tennessee Electric has any enduring force. 6 The central holding of this decision was 7 overruled. The further you go in the decision the less 8 satisfying it is. If you go all the way to reading the 9 Georgia Power case cited in footnote 27 as Justice 10 Breyer has done, and you look at the role of consent of 11 the States, it turns out in the district court opinion, 12 that's in the merits section of the opinion. 13 The Court's already held contrary, actually, 14 to the holding of Tennessee Electric that the utility 15 companies there had standing. So what you see is, you 16 know what happens if you apply the legal interest test, 17 you hopelessly conflate the merits and the standing 18 question. That's kind of happened today in oral 19 argument. That's a bad approach. The Court was right 20 to get rid of it in camp, and it should perfect the camp 21 decision by saying this sentence no longer survives. 22 Two other minor points. One is on the 23 Commerce Clause, I think Justice Alito shows why the 24 Government was right never to make that argument below, 25 but I do think it's important that if this Court says
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 anything about the Commerce Clause issue, it doesn't 2 somehow reinject it in the case in a way that would not 3 allow us to argue that it has been clearly waived in the 4 Third Circuit. The Government gets to confess air, it 5 doesn't get to confess, oh, actually, we have a better 6 argument to defend the statute that we've never raised 7 before. Plain error should be a two-way street, and 8 they should not be allowed to sneak the Commerce Clause 9 back into the case at this late stage. 10 Finally, there is no difference between the 11 separation of powers case and the Federalism case. The 12 best example of that is this Court's Free Enterprise 13 Fund case. When it wants a case to cite for the 14 proposition that the Executive Branch cannot waive or 15 acquiesce in a separation of powers violation, because 16 the separation of powers is there to protect the 17 individual, what does it cite? New York against United 18 States. Please reverse the decision below. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 20 Clement. 21 Mr. McAllister, this Court appointed you to 22 brief and argue the case in support of the judgment 23 below, you have ably discharged that responsibility for 24 which we are grateful. 25 The case is submitted.
