1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:03 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 09-993, Pliva, 5 Incorporated v. Mensing, and the consolidated cases. 6 Mr. Lefkowitz. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY P. LEFKOWITZ 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 10 it please the Court: 11 This case involves the ordinary operation of 12 the Supremacy Clause. As the government agrees, 13 Hatch-Waxman's plain text requires generic drugs to have 14 the same warnings as their brand-name equivalents, so 15 State law can't require generic drugs to use different 16 warnings. After all, generics can't simultaneously 17 comply with a Federal duty to be the same and a State 18 duty to be different. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that makes a 20 lot of sense, but we do have our Wyeth decision that 21 seems to cut the other way. 22 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, Your Honor, the Wyeth 23 decision is premised on the fundamental conclusion that 24 Federal law obligates and accommodates the brand 25 manufacturer to utilize a specific regulation, the CBE
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 regulation, in order to make a warning change, in order 2 to comply with its obligations under 201.57. And, as 3 the government agrees, we don't have the opportunity or 4 the authority to use a CBE regulation change. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have another - 6 you have another route, and that's what the government 7 is telling us: That you could propose a revision of the 8 label, and if you did that, then you would be home free. 9 You would not be subject to the State suit. 10 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Ginsburg, the 11 government agrees with us that we can't actually change 12 the label. What they say is, we could have an 13 obligation, or they actually, in -- for the very first 14 time ever in their brief in this Court at the merit 15 stage, said that there is a - 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, it was in the -- at 17 the cert stage as well. 18 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, Your Honor, I didn't 19 read the cert stage as saying we had quite the same duty 20 to ask the FDA, although clearly they now believe that 21 we have a duty to ask the FDA. And of course that's not 22 a duty that appears in any of their notice and comment 23 rulemaking. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can we call this the take 25 steps -- is this the take-steps doctrine, for purposes
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 of discussion here? 2 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Yes, Justice Kennedy, this 3 is the take-steps. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not clear to me 5 whether you say that that is preempted or just that it 6 was not well-pled. I'm not -- I'm not sure of your 7 position on that point. 8 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Thank you, Justice Kennedy. 9 We maintain that a claim that under State law a generic 10 company can be liable for not asking the FDA to make a 11 labeling change is preempted under this Court's 12 decisions both in Buckman and in ArkLa, because what 13 the -- what the Court has said is that the disclosure 14 obligations between a Federal agency and a Federally 15 regulated party are inherently Federal in character, and 16 this is not a subject of traditional State tort law. 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, why 18 should - 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would the -- excuse me, 20 Justice. 21 Would the Federally licensed drug 22 manufacturer have a similar obligation to lobby the FDA 23 for a change? 24 MR. LEFKOWITZ: No, Your Honor, and in fact 25 that was in part what was -- what came up in the
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 briefing in the Wyeth case. Wyeth initially said it 2 didn't have the obligation and couldn't use the CBE, and 3 then Ms. Levine said: Well, in that case you could have 4 asked the FDA to make a change, and the Court didn't 5 need to even address that issue, because the Court found 6 that there actually was a regulation on point that gave 7 the brand manufacturer the ability to change. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: But assume there hadn't 9 been. Assume there hadn't been such a regulation. Do 10 you understand it to be the government's position that 11 the licensed drug manufacturer is not protected from 12 State suits, even though it has a Federal permission to 13 give certain warnings, unless it has lobbied the FDA to 14 change those warnings? 15 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, I -- I don't see 16 anything in the history, the 27-year history of 17 Hatch-Waxman, where the Federal government has ever said 18 that there is a legal obligation to lobby the FDA for a 19 labeling change. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. There is a 21 legal obligation to advise the FDA when you have reports 22 of adverse results that suggest the label may be wrong. 23 Are you disavowing your -- your obligation to tell the 24 FDA when something's wrong? 25 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely not, Justice

1 Sotomayor. 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So please describe 3 what the difference between that obligation and the 4 obligation to suggest a label change when you know it's 5 been misbranded. 6 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Under the FDA Regulation 7 314.80 and 314.98, we have a myriad of disclosure 8 obligations. Any time a generic learns about an adverse 9 report, it has to report it to the FDA, it has to 10 investigate it, and if it doesn't do that then it's not 11 in compliance with its Federal obligations and the FDA 12 has plenary authority to take all sorts of action. 13 But just as the Court said in the Buckman 14 decision, without dissent, when a company doesn't make 15 appropriate disclosures to the FDA, even if people are 16 hurt by that, even if it's -- if it causes people to be 17 injured and States might otherwise want to compensate 18 them for them, those disclosure obligations are up to 19 the FDA with its discretion to enforce. And the Court 20 looked directly to Congress in section 337. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's -- so what's 22 the conflict with State law, meaning you have an 23 obligation to keep your label as it is, but if you also 24 have a Federal obligation to advise the FDA of 25 adverse -- of adverse results and of needs for change,
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 why can't you then comply with a duty to warn obligation 2 because you can go to the -- to the FDA? 3 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, first of all, there's 4 a little bit of a difference between reporting all of 5 the adverse events, which we clearly do, and asking the 6 FDA to make a determination that the FDA has said is 7 only for the FDA to make with respect to generic 8 companies. 9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you contest, 10 Mr. Lefkowitz, your ability to make that request? I 11 know that you contest your obligation to make that 12 request, but do you think you could go to the FDA and 13 make that request and set a process in motion? 14 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, there's no 15 question that we could certainly ask the FDA, and in 16 fact if we had reason to believe that a label was not 17 accurate, not strong enough, we would certainly do that. 18 The question is whether or not there's either a Federal 19 obligation or a State duty to do this, and - 20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if you could go to the 21 FDA, why shouldn't we look at this suit in this way: 22 That the plaintiffs are bringing a standard failure to 23 warn claim; that you then have a preemption defense, 24 that you'll say it's impossible; and then in order to 25 litigate that preemption defense, the question will be,
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 well, if you had gone to the FDA, what would the FDA 2 have done? Would it in fact have required both brand 3 names and generics to change the label? And if it would 4 have, you would not have had -- been put in an 5 impossible position. 6 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, that is the 7 precise set of issues that this Court addressed both in 8 Buckman and in ArkLa, in a situation where all we could 9 have done, and we weren't obligated to do, was ask the 10 FDA. For a State to hold us liable for not asking the 11 FDA is asking a State jury to put itself into the shoes 12 of the FDA, to speculate how the FDA would have decided 13 hypothetical issues, which ArkLa says is foreclosed in 14 an area where the Federal Government, the Federal 15 agency, has exclusive authority. And in Buckman, the 16 Court said that would disrupt and usurp the discretion 17 of the agency to decide whether to punish and how to 18 punish disclosure. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Buckman -20 Buckman was arguably a little bit different, in that 21 there's a concern expressed in that case that 22 requiring allowing the State suit to go forward would 23 cause manufacturers to basically inundate the agency 24 with proposals and warning revisions, so that there 25 would be so many things that the agency wouldn't even be
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 able to process them, and they would become meaningless 2 to the consumers. That doesn't seem to me to be a 3 concern in this case. 4 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, Your Honor, the 5 government had articulated that proposition in the 6 Buckman case and again several years later in the 7 Warner-Lambert case. Obviously, they're taking a 8 different position here. 9 But I would submit, Your Honor, that what 10 lay at the core of the Buckman decision was that the 11 relationship, the disclosures, between the Federal 12 agency and its regulated party, are inherently Federal 13 and States simply don't have a business trying to 14 enforce those obligations, because that does take away 15 from the authority and the discretion. And the Court 16 looked to section 337 as evidence that Congress intended 17 that violations of the FDCA be enforced by the Federal 18 Government. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Federal agency says 20 that these suits complement, they're not at odds with, 21 the Federal regime, because they give the manufacturers 22 an incentive to come forward. Everyone is interested in 23 making sure that only safe drugs are marketed. So, far 24 from detracting from the Federal regime, the agency 25 responsible says, this helps us; it encourages
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 manufacturers to report. 2 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, we know from the 3 current FDA database that there were over 1600 requests 4 for labeling revisions that the FDA has not acted on, 5 and that's just in the aftermath of Wyeth. And there 6 are far more generic manufacturers who would be burdened 7 by this new obligation. But, Your Honor, I would - 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is there any 9 breakdown as to how many of those requests are generic 10 and how many from branded? 11 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, almost all of 12 them I would believe are from branded manufacturers, 13 because generic manufacturers until the briefing in this 14 Court have never believed that they have any obligation 15 to ask the FDA. 16 In fact, interestingly, the FDA has 17 addressed what happens in the marketplace when a brand 18 exits the market and the only drugs left are the 10 or 19 15 generics. And what the FDA has said, and they have 20 published 52 Federal Register notices -- we cite one of 21 them in our reply brief -- they have said: In such a 22 situation, we will designate one of the generics to be 23 the leader for purposes of establishing the label, and 24 everyone else has to follow. 25 But critically, what the FDA has said is:
12
Alderson Reporting Company

1 In those situations, we, the FDA, will tell you when the 2 label needs to change. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: So what are you supposed to 4 do if your company happens by chance to come across a 5 very, very high correlation between people who take your 6 generic drug and who get seriously ill? 7 And now what you know is that nobody else 8 has really found that, but, my goodness, there you are; 9 it happened that it was associated, a special group or 10 something. What are you supposed to do? 11 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, we have an 12 obligation, actually, to provide all of that information 13 to the FDA. Generics, unlike brand companies, aren't 14 equipped in the same way, necessarily, to evaluate 15 the - 16 JUSTICE BREYER: And so are they saying that 17 you -- is it conceded in this case that you did tell the 18 FDA everything you knew about that? 19 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, no. We - 20 JUSTICE BREYER: Or is that a point in 21 dispute? 22 MR. LEFKOWITZ: The plaintiffs allege that 23 we violated Federal disclosure obligations. Of course, 24 there's no basis for a State claim for that. 25 In fact, to -- to address Justice Ginsburg's
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 question - 2 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how would it 3 conflict? Suppose the State said: Here is what we 4 want; we notice that it says in the Federal law that you 5 must keep your warnings up to date, and if you find an 6 association, you must revise your warning. Now, we 7 understand you can't do that without FDA approval. But 8 as far as our State is concerned, we think that when you 9 come across this serious problem you have to tell the 10 FDA in some form or other, a reasonable form, about it. 11 Would that law -- is there anything Federal that that 12 law would conflict with? 13 MR. LEFKOWITZ: I think that law, Your 14 Honor, would conflict with the Buckman principles and 15 the ArkLa principles. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said you had 17 to tell the FDA about it. 18 MR. LEFKOWITZ: If the -- I understood 19 Justice Breyer's question to be asking whether -- not 20 only did we have to tell the FDA, which we clearly do, 21 but whether we then had some additional duty to ask the 22 FDA to change the warning. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I didn't understand 24 that. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: What I wonder -- see, I
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 wonder if that's this case. I wonder if this case is 2 what they're saying is: Oh, we concede you told the FDA 3 every single thing, so they were just as informed as you 4 are about the risks here, but you did not add the words: 5 And please change our -- your permission, so that we can 6 change the warning. Is that what this case is about? 7 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, I think that's what 8 they're suggesting. But even if it were just the 9 former - 10 JUSTICE BREYER: When they come up here they 11 might say this isn't just what this case is about. 12 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Even if it's just the 13 former, Your Honor, even if it's just the failure to 14 disclose adverse reports - 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. 16 MR. LEFKOWITZ: -- which we know we have an 17 obligation to do, there is no history of State 18 regulation of communications between Federal -- Federal 19 agencies and the regulated parties. Those are not the 20 kinds of parallel claims cases, like in Lohr v. 21 Medtronic - 22 JUSTICE BREYER: So your argument is that if 23 we run across this tremendous, really serious -- I can 24 make an imaginary as serious as you want -- really a 25 serious problem, and you're saying the State has no
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 right to say -- even if we purposely didn't tell 2 anybody, they can't get involved because they can't get 3 involved with our failure to tell the FDA anything 4 because that's Federal, and we can't -- they can't get 5 involved with our failure to try to change the warning 6 because that's taken care of by our obligation to tell 7 them, which we didn't fulfill? 8 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Breyer, correct, 9 because that's exactly -- remember, in Buckman what 10 happened was an individual was injured because the 11 company had not accurately disclosed, in fact had misled 12 the agency about the purpose of marketing these bone 13 screws. Clearly there was a State interest in 14 protecting and providing a remedy to that consumer, a 15 State interest in ensuring accurate disclosures to the 16 government, and in fact an allegation that had there 17 been accurate disclosures to the government, the FDA 18 would have made a different safety and labeling 19 determination. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you say that if the 21 claim here is simply that you did not disclose properly, 22 that claim could be brought? 23 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Not in a State court, Your 24 Honor. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To disclose -- I'm
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 sorry. To disclose to the FDA? 2 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Correct. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: To disclose to the FDA. 4 MR. LEFKOWITZ: A claim, Your Honor, of 5 disclosure to the FDA relates to the inherently Federal 6 relationship. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you just described 8 Buckman as -- as involving precisely that, failure to 9 tell the FDA the purpose of the screws. You said that 10 the State -- the State suit would lie because of that 11 failure. 12 MR. LEFKOWITZ: No, I said the State suit -13 I apologize. I meant to say and I thought I said the 14 State suit would not lie because Buckman preempts that 15 type of lawsuit. Buckman says even in that terrible 16 situation, misleading to the FDA, failure to disclose 17 what the FDA requires you to disclose, there is no State 18 cause of action because this is a uniquely Federal area 19 and States can't supplant the FDA in its enforcement 20 discretion. 21 JUSTICE KAGAN: But Mr. Lefkowitz, I think 22 what the Respondents would say is that you are 23 mischaracterizing their complaint and making it into 24 something that it's not. Their complaint is a standard 25 state failure to warn claim. Now, you have a preemption
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 defense to that claim, and in that preemption defense 2 there's going to be questions about your disclosure 3 obligations and whether the FDA would have responded in 4 a certain way to your disclosure obligations, but it's 5 in a fundamentally different posture than the one that 6 you're suggesting. 7 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Kagan, I would agree 8 with you that what they pled below was a traditional 9 failure to warn. A failure to warn claim means you did 10 not warn the public in the way that we think under State 11 law you should have. And whereas in Wyeth the Congress 12 through the FDA has said a brand manufacturer ultimately 13 is responsible for the warnings it issues and therefore 14 can change the warning and therefore can be held liable, 15 we don't have -- and the government agrees with us -- we 16 don't have any mechanism under law to change the 17 warnings. So to the extent this is a traditional 18 failure to warn claim, it has to be preempted under 19 simple Supremacy Clause principles. 20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I agree that you don't 21 have any ability yourself to change the warning, but 22 here's what the FDA has said. The FDA has said if an 23 ANDA applicant -- and that's you; you're an ANDA 24 applicant -- believes new safety information should be 25 added to a product's labeling, presumably because
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 they've gotten information that suggests that the 2 product's labeling is wrong, then it should contact the 3 FDA, and the FDA will determine whether the labeling for 4 the generic and listed drugs should be revised. 5 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, that is exactly 6 what the FDA says. They point for that to a preamble in 7 1992 to a rulemaking that didn't address the relevant 8 201.57 regulation, a preamble that was issued without 9 notice and comment rulemaking, and a preamble that 10 doesn't actually impose a duty. It says if, 11 subjunctively, we believe that there should be a label 12 change, we should do something, we should ask the FDA. 13 Not we must, not we shall. 14 And even then it said: And the FDA will 15 then make a decision, which makes clear that this is not 16 a decision for State juries to make. Your Honor, the 17 FDA has articulated a Federal duty today in its briefing 18 in this case that is very much at odds with what it has 19 specifically said about what a generic's obligation is 20 under 201.57. In the two notice and comment rulemakings 21 at issue during the relevant time period here, in 2000 22 and 2006, what the FDA said very specifically was a 23 generic's obligation under 201.57 is to use the brand 24 label, even if the brand label isn't the most 25 up-to-date.
19

1 And the reason is the policy underlying 2 Hatch-Waxman is that brand companies do safety and 3 efficacy testing; generics do sameness testing. 4 Generics are required to make copies of the drugs and by 5 definition make copies of the labels, because it 6 wouldn't make any sense to go into a drugstore to buy 7 Advil and to see 15 different generic ibuprofen and to 8 have 15 different sets of warnings. 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you think - 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Buckman was a case -- I'm 11 pronouncing it right, I think, Buckman -- where it was a 12 branded manufacturer, was it not? 13 MR. LEFKOWITZ: It was a medical device 14 manufacturer. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: A medical device 16 manufacturer. So there it was -- it was an FDA process, 17 and we said there's no State cause of action for saying 18 that the FDA process -- that's slightly different from 19 saying that you have a duty to warn the FDA. You might 20 say it's a fortiori. 21 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, I do think it's 22 a fortiori. Buckman involves the branded process of 23 coming on with an equivalent medical device under the 24 510K process. This is actually a situation where, after 25 intensive back and forth with the FDA, the brand company
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 crafts the label that the FDA approves and the generic 2 is given one responsibility by Congress. The 3 responsibility is to maintain the same label as the 4 brand. That's the critical difference. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you think 6 Congress really intended to create a market in which 7 consumers can only sue brand-named products? Because if 8 that's the case, why would anybody ever take a genetic? 9 And why in the world would Congress create a different, 10 or even the FDA, a different obligation on brand-named 11 products or generic products to give them information 12 about labels when they know there's been a misbranding? 13 What the government says is you start by 14 instructing a jury that there had to actually have been 15 information that proved a misbranding. That's the first 16 step of the tort suit according to the government. So 17 why should you or why would Congress or the FDA have 18 intended to treat the two differently? 19 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Sotomayor, I want to 20 take both halves of your question. In 27 years of 21 enforcement under Hatch-Waxman, the FDA has never once 22 said that a generic drug that uses the brand label, as 23 required under 505(j) of the statute is misbranded. And 24 the -- look, I understand that from the consumer's 25 perspective it may not make a lot of sense. But what
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Congress specifically said is that a generic has to bear 2 the same label, and it's because they do have different 3 purposes, different functions. Congress said that 4 whenever there is a brand drug on the market that no 5 longer is protected by its patent monopoly but has been 6 selling for $10 or $20 a pill, we want to have generics 7 selling for pennies for the pill, and they've given 8 branded and generics different obligations. 9 And the different obligations are seen most 10 clearly through the prism of the Wyeth case. The Wyeth 11 case was -- it was critical in the Wyeth case that this 12 Court found that the brand company had the ability, had 13 the obligation, to use the CBE regulations to actually 14 change the label, whereas here what the FDA has said 15 time and time again is: We'll tell a generic when the 16 generic has to change the label, because we don't assume 17 that the generics are going to know when the label 18 should change because they don't have the same basis of 19 clinical testing and results. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Lefkowitz, there's a 21 certain overlap, is there not? Some of the generics are 22 made by the same people that make the brand-name drugs, 23 isn't that so? 24 MR. LEFKOWITZ: That is correct, Your Honor. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And at least for those
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 people, they have the means. 2 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, I don't know 3 whether or not the -- the FDA or this Court would hold 4 differently in a case where the generic at issue was an 5 authorized generic, a generic manufactured by a brand 6 company that had, in fact, done all the clinical safety 7 testing and might have a different basis for assessing 8 the occasional adverse reports that they get. 9 But, again, the keys to understanding the - 10 the generic industry -- generics rarely even get adverse 11 reports because if a doctor prescribes a drug, the 12 doctor prescribes it as the brand, and then checks off 13 the box that says a generic can be issued. If a patient 14 comes and tells him about an adverse report, the doctor 15 has no idea which generic of the 15 that might be in the 16 market actually was dispensed, so he'll actually tell 17 the brand company. He'll report the adverse event to 18 the brand company. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, all you're 20 arguing is that this rule will have little practical 21 effect, that there is going to be very few lawsuits that 22 could be brought against your companies because you're 23 just not going to have enough information to suggest a 24 label change. 25 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, what I'm arguing
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 is that for the FDA to impose a new Federal obligation 2 that will significantly change the way generic companies 3 conduct their business should go through notice and 4 comment rulemaking. It should not rely on a preamble to 5 a different rulemaking that didn't go through notice and 6 comment. It should not rely on briefs that are filed at 7 the merits stage, because this would totally change the 8 way generics do business. 9 Generics don't have a practice -- they're 10 not even set up -- to go and figure out what label 11 changes would be appropriate. They are set up to report 12 adverse events to the FDA, and what Congress has said 13 and what the FDA has said is violations of those 14 statutes, violations of those regulations, are 15 exclusively within the province of the Federal 16 government. That's what Buckman says very clearly when 17 it looks at Section 337. 18 If I may, I would like to reserve my time. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 20 Mr. Lefkowitz. 21 Mr. Bograd. 22 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS M. BOGRAD 23 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 24 MR. BOGRAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 25 please the Court:

1 The central issue in this case is that 2 Petitioners, in the face of considerable information 3 that the warnings on their products were inadequate, did 4 nothing. The generic drug companies' position is that 5 they -- no matter how much they know, no matter how 6 grave the risk, they are under no obligation to do 7 anything to warn of the dangers of the products they 8 sell. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they're -- they're - 10 they're under the obligation to report to the FDA the 11 facts which establish the grave risk, right? 12 MR. BOGRAD: Yes, they are, Your Honor. 13 They're obliged under - 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the argument here is 15 whether it -- it will be the FDA ultimately that 16 determines whether there was a grave enough risk to 17 modify the -- the label or whether that call will be 18 made by -- by a State court guessing what the FDA would 19 have done, right? 20 MR. BOGRAD: No, Your Honor, that's not 21 correct. What this Court said in Wyeth v. Levine is 22 that State juries are a perfectly appropriate vehicle 23 for assessing whether warnings in the past were 24 adequately given. We do -- we do not dispute that the 25 issue about what language will be on a label going

1 forward rests with the agency. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but -- but -- no, 3 but -- but surely you have to establish not only that 4 the generic manufacturer requested a label change, but 5 that a label change would have been approved. Otherwise 6 there's no causation. Surely - 7 MR. BOGRAD: That's correct, Your Honor. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's part of your 9 case, isn't it? 10 MR. BOGRAD: No, it's not, Justice Scalia. 11 The -- as Petitioners concede in the brief, under 12 traditional State law failure to warn claim, our 13 affirmative case is that the warnings that were given to 14 the doctor and to the patient were inadequate, and that 15 because adequate warnings weren't given, the patient was 16 injured. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but -- but their - 18 their preemption claim is we had to give these warnings, 19 and you don't contest that. They had to give the 20 warnings that they gave, unless the FDA said that the 21 warnings must be changed, so - 22 MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I mean, I don't see how 24 you can hold them liable, so long as they continued to 25 give the warnings that they had to give.

1 MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor - 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: And they could have lobbied 3 the FDA to say, you know, change the warning, but if the 4 FDA said -- suppose the -- suppose they did tell the 5 FDA, please modify the label, and the FDA said no. 6 Would your lawsuit still proceed? 7 MR. BOGRAD: No, it would not, Your Honor. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. 9 MR. BOGRAD: Once the FDA said no, we would 10 have clear evidence that the FDA would have rejected the 11 warning - 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would say - 13 MR. BOGRAD: -- which is what this Court 14 said in Levine is the touchstone. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. You're drawing 16 a line between the FDA rejecting a warning and the FDA 17 not accepting the warning; is that the line you're 18 drawing? 19 MR. BOGRAD: Yes, Your Honor, for purposes 20 of impossibility. In order for the -- preemption is an 21 affirmative defense, and for the defendants to establish 22 that it was impossible, i.e., that the duties under 23 State and Federal law were in direct conflict, they have 24 to show that the FDA would have rejected - 25 JUSTICE BREYER: It appears also that the -

1 it's Buckman, it seems to me, the relevant case, not 2 Wyeth, because what -- if -- you're now saying, I've 3 learned, that -- that they have a set of FDA duties; 4 they must tell the FDA every detail. 5 MR. BOGRAD: Well - 6 JUSTICE BREYER: That sounds awfully 7 familiar to Buckman, where the State claim was basically 8 a claim of fraud on the FDA. And we said it's not up to 9 the State to -- to -- they can't bring -- have a claim 10 for fraud on the FDA. The FDA has to enforce their own 11 stuff. And why isn't the same true here, that the FDA 12 has to enforce their own legal requirement to tell us 13 everything you know? What's the answer to that? 14 MR. BOGRAD: Well, there are two answers, 15 Your Honor. First -- first, this Court's decision in 16 Levine is inconsistent with that sweeping reading - 17 JUSTICE BREYER: No, because Levine involves 18 the Wyeth case, right? 19 MR. BOGRAD: Yes. I'm sorry, I - 20 JUSTICE BREYER: No. The -- the difference 21 there is the difference that the SG points out: There 22 is a broad-ranging obligation for the initial drugmaker 23 to tell the FDA all kinds of things and change the 24 warnings. But here the FDA tells us they have no power 25 to change their warnings. They can't, unlike Levine.

1 They have to copy the original maker. So -- I'm -- I'm 2 just referring there to the whole SG brief. 3 MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor, let me respond to 4 that in -- in two ways. First - 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Be sure you answer, please, 6 my original question. 7 MR. BOGRAD: I -- I will, Your Honor. 8 The -- to focus first on the CBE issue, one 9 of the things this Court noted in Levine is that even 10 under the CBE process, the ultimate decision about 11 whether the labeling is changed rests with the FDA, not 12 with the manufacturer. The -- the fundamental issue in 13 Levine was that the primary responsibility for labeling 14 rested with the manufacturer, not with the agency, 15 subject to the agency's review. And we don't dispute 16 that the agency has the right to review and can reject a 17 label. 18 The -- what was at the core and what this 19 Court cited, although the -- the number has changed in 20 Wyeth v. Levine, is the obligation under 21 CFR 21 201.57(e), which you call 201.80(e) because they -- they 22 renumbered it -- that the label warnings shall be 23 revised as soon as there's reasonable evidence of an 24 association of a serious hazard with the drug. 25 The government says, and the regulatory
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 structure makes clear, that that provision applies with 2 full force to generic drug manufacturers, not just to 3 name-brand drug manufacturers. It is the regulatory 4 implementation of the obligation under the Federal 5 misbranding statute, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2) that says you 6 can't sell a drug that doesn't have adequate warnings 7 about its risks. 8 So, when you're -- when the manufacturer is 9 confronted with information that the warnings on its 10 drug are not adequate, it -- the way it -- the way it 11 should respond is by immediately going to the FDA and 12 saying to the agency: We have this new information; we 13 ask you, not that we want a different warning from the 14 name brand, but we ask you to approve a stronger warning 15 on both the name-brand product and its generic 16 equivalents. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what happens - 18 MR. BOGRAD: And had they done so, we would 19 know -- one of two things would have happened. Either 20 the agency would have approved the warning, stronger 21 warnings would have been given and our clients -- my 22 clients likely would not have been injured; or they 23 would have said, no, we don't think there's sufficient 24 information to justify this warning. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How long does it
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 take -- how long typically does it take the FDA to 2 respond to a request from a generic manufacturer that 3 it -- it ask the branded manufacturer to change the 4 label? 5 MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor, as you just heard 6 from Mr. Lefkowitz, generic manufacturers typically 7 haven't been fulfilling this obligation and have not 8 been asking the agency. But the latest data from the 9 agency, and this is from its -- its web site, is that 10 under -- they've been publishing performance data since 11 2007, and they now say that safety labeling changes, 12 which are the labeling changes required under FD - 13 under FDA, are processed typically in a matter of 14 months, 94 percent within 3 months. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are those the ones 16 that are submitted by generic manufacturers? 17 MR. BOGRAD: They're -- they are -- they 18 could be ones submitted by generic manufacturers. Those 19 are ones where the information that comes to the agency 20 triggers a -- a labeling revision process. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the -- does the - 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- whether about - 23 MR. BOGRAD: I'm sorry, what was that? 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to 25 ask, does the FDA give you an up or a down, or does it

1 just not take action sometimes if you submit one of 2 these requests? 3 MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor, my understanding - 4 there were certainly procedures available that would 5 have required an up-or-down: The citizens petition 6 process, for example, the supplement process, for 7 example. The -- what -- the government has represented 8 that even if the request came in a more informal form, 9 the government would nevertheless take a request for a 10 -- a labeling change to reflect a serious inadequacy in 11 label warning seriously and act on it promptly. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just so I understand what 13 you've said, this 3-month turnaround that you mentioned, 14 they are all requests from labeled manufacturers, right? 15 MR. BOGRAD: No, Your Honor, these are - 16 these are actually - 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said that 18 generic manufacturers don't make any requests. 19 MR. BOGRAD: I -- they could be -- they 20 could be from name-brand companies; they could be from 21 private citizens. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay. 23 MR.

1 MR. BOGRAD: But the agency also processes 2 supplement requests, according to its web site, in 97 3 percent of the cases or something, within 4 months. 4 It's not -- it's -- it is a matter of months, not -- not 5 years. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you, and I think 7 that this is part of what your adversary has been 8 talking about when he says we don't usually receive 9 adverse incident reports; they go to the brand 10 manufacturer. So tell me what you view as your main 11 obligation. This is a little bit like what Justice 12 Scalia was asking. 13 You come in and you say there's a drug, it 14 has an adverse effect, there should have been a warning 15 about it because look at all of this literature, look at 16 all of this proof - 17 MR. BOGRAD: Uh-huh. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that this drug is, in 19 fact, in some way plausibly or otherwise causing this 20 incident, and the label was inadequate to tell me not to 21 do it. Is that your obligation completely? You don't 22 have an obligation to show that this particular 23 manufacturer knew that in some way? 24 MR. BOGRAD: Well, under most -- under the 25 law of most States, and this is true in both Louisiana
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and Minnesota, there is a reasonableness element in a 2 failure to warn claim, but it's -- the standard is "knew 3 or should have known," so that the manufacturer - 4 manufacturers are typically held to the -- to the 5 knowledge of an expert in the field of the products they 6 manufacture. And here the -- our contention has been 7 that if the generic manufacturers had merely examined 8 the publicly available FDA database of adverse event 9 reports, and merely paid attention to reports in the 10 published literature that had since 19 -- the early 11 1990s had documented a serious association between 12 long-term use of metoclopramide and tardive dyskinesia, 13 they would have had more than sufficient information to 14 say to the agency, we need a change here. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does a generic manufacturer 16 have to be an expert in the field in which it 17 manufactures? 18 MR. BOGRAD: Under State law, yes, it does, 19 Your Honor. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does -- what does 21 being an expert mean? 22 MR. BOGRAD: It means - 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: In this context, being an 24 expert means being able to produce exactly the drug that 25 has been approved by the FDA, right? You don't have to

1 be expert in anything else? 2 MR. BOGRAD: That's incorrect, Your Honor. 3 They have to be - 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: What else do they need? 5 MR. BOGRAD: They have to remain informed of 6 the dangers posed by the products they sell. They have 7 obligations - 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't make them an 9 expert. I'm talking about what expertise does -- does 10 the company have to -- to possess. It surely has to 11 possess the chemical expertise to produce exactly the 12 product that the -- that the -- that has been approved 13 by the FDA. What other expertise is necessary? 14 MR. BOGRAD: Well, Your Honor, one of their 15 obligations under Federal law is to go to the agency 16 every year and identify significant new information that 17 would affect the safety or efficacy or labeling of their 18 product, which means they have to have the capacity to 19 evaluate information that is out there, and that - 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that'd take 21 any expertise. You have people who complain, I've taken 22 -- I've taken your pill, and it -- it, you know, it's 23 caused -- this is expertise? That's not what I normally 24 think of. Whereas a drug manufacturer does, indeed, 25 require expertise, conducting tests and knowing what
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 changes will produce what results and so forth; right? 2 MR. BOGRAD: No, Your Honor. In fact, in 3 this particular context we're talking about a use that 4 was never approved by the FDA. We're talking about use 5 beyond 12 weeks, which had never been evaluated. So 6 there's really no basis to assume that the name-brand 7 manufacturer here had any more expertise - 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose they had. Suppose 9 that -- is a generic required to file adverse incident 10 reports? 11 MR. BOGRAD: Yes, they are, Your Honor. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, imagine a 13 company that files every adverse incident report, 14 complies completely; period. Now, in your view does it 15 have an additional obligation? 16 MR. BOGRAD: Yes, it does, Your Honor. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: And what is that? 18 MR. BOGRAD: It has an obligation under 19 201.57(e) to initiate a label change - 20 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 21 MR.

1 MR. BOGRAD: All right. If we -- we were 2 talking about - 3 JUSTICE BREYER: Now. And that's what I - 4 now, as to the second, it just doesn't add anything. 5 The FDA has all that information. 6 MR. BOGRAD: Oh, that's -- that's incorrect, 7 Justice Breyer. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, why is it? 9 MR. BOGRAD: It's -- well, as this Court 10 said in Levine, the FDA has 11,000 drugs it needs to 11 monitor and stay on top of, and it doesn't have the 12 resources necessary to pay attention to every adverse 13 event report it gets and every report that is published 14 in the scientific literature. The reason that 15 manufacturers bear the primary responsibility is because 16 they -- they need to trigger the FDA's focus on a 17 particular issue here. Here this information was 18 available since the mid '90s. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: Your basic argument, I'm 20 getting this now, that -- I think -- is that the 21 failure is, where State law has a right to enter, is to 22 require them to keep track of adverse incidents and 23 other things in the -- and do their best to change the 24 label, which will consist of going to the FDA, likely, 25 and asking them to change.

1 MR. BOGRAD: Exactly, Your Honor. Their 2 obligation -- their obligation under State law is to 3 provide a warning. What they should have done, and if 4 you take -- what they should have done is go to the FDA 5 and ask the FDA to approve a stronger warning. If the 6 FDA had said no, they would have a preemption. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel - 8 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose a generic -- suppose 9 that the FDA issued a rule that says a generic drug 10 manufacturer has no obligation to request a change in 11 labeling. Could a generic drug manufacturer be held 12 liable on a failure to warn claim on the theory that it 13 could have lobbied the FDA to change the rule that says 14 that the generic drug manufacturer has no obligation to 15 ask for a change in labeling? 16 MR. BOGRAD: I -- I don't have an immediate 17 answer to that, Justice Alito. The -- the -- the State 18 -- the -- I -- the question is whether there would be a 19 direct conflict between State and Federal law. It seems 20 to me unless -- I'm sorry. Oh, that's the 5 minute 21 light. 22 Unless the - 23 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that why -- isn't that 24 where your theory leads? 25 MR. BOGRAD: My -- my theory leads to the -
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to the proposition that, unless Federal law precludes 2 them from -- from going to the process of strengthening 3 their warning label, then the State may legitimately 4 enforce its obligation to protect its citizens' health 5 and safety. I think it's important in this regard - 6 JUSTICE ALITO: But your theory is that they 7 have a duty to pursue an informal process that is 8 nowhere provided for under the FDA rules; and so I don't 9 -- so it's a duty to lobby the FDA basically to change 10 the rules, isn't that right? 11 MR. BOGRAD: Justice Alito, well, as you 12 know, we disagree with the government about whether 13 certain formal processes were available. But - 14 JUSTICE ALITO: Assuming that they're 15 correct in their interpretation of their own 16 regulations. 17 MR. BOGRAD: But assuming -- but -- but if 18 we're talking -- but there may not be a formal process, 19 but there is a formal obligation, both under statute, 20 not to sell a misbranded drug, and under regulation, to 21 revise your labeling as soon as there's reasonable 22 evidence of an association of a serious hazard with the 23 drug. And I think it's - 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is your -- what is 25 your explanation for why Buckman isn't applicable here?
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. BOGRAD: Because, Your Honor, this is - 2 and I should start by saying that in Buckman there was 3 -- the suit was not against the manufacturer; the suit 4 in Buckman was against a consultant that -- that helped 5 the manufacturer get FDA approval. There was a separate 6 product liability action against the manufacturer that 7 had already been litigated and settled. 8 The -- Buckman said: We're not talking 9 about traditional causes of action, State law causes of 10 action like in Lohr, or like in -- or as this Court 11 again said in Wyeth v. Levine; we're talking about a 12 case where the whole centrality of the claim is premised 13 on the relationship between the company -- or the 14 defendant and the agency. 15 This is not that case. We're -- this case 16 is about the -- the duty that the company owes to my 17 clients and their doctors to provide them with adequate 18 warnings. That duty, which is -- has been recognized by 19 this Court innumerable times, complements the FDA 20 statutory scheme by creating incentives for companies 21 like the Petitioners to - 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the suit was brought 23 by the injured person in Buckman. 24 MR. BOGRAD: But - 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's similar in that
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 respect. And in Buckman there was a -- a formal 2 relationship which did not permit the cause of action, 3 and it seems to me you could at least argue that a 4 fortiori there should be no cause of action when there 5 an informal relationship. 6 MR. BOGRAD: I -- I'm not sure I follow the 7 a fortiori point in this context, Your Honor. But in 8 Buckman there was no relationship whatsoever between the 9 consultant, the Buckman Company, and the injured person. 10 The Buckman Company's dealing were -- had been 11 exclusively with the agency. 12 They had had no dealing whatsoever -- they 13 had not failed to warn. That's why we -- the plaintiffs 14 had created this bizarre cause of action, and it's -- we 15 think it's a wholly distinguishable case. 16 I think it's important to remember, first 17 off, the world in which we live today. 70 percent of 18 all prescriptions are filled with generic drugs. A 19 third of generic drugs no longer have name-brand 20 competitors at all, because the economic -- because the 21 name brands have withdrawn from the market, so that - 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Somebody has been appointed 23 in all those cases to sort of carry the flag, right? 24 MR. BOGRAD: Somebody has been appointed to 25 be the reference-listed drug. They have not been
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 appointed to have obligations distinct from the other 2 generic companies as far as updating label claims. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't they have a distinct 4 obligation to propose labeling changes when they -- when 5 they think they're necessary? 6 MR. BOGRAD: I -- Your Honor, that would be 7 a question better directed to Mr. Kneedler, but I don't 8 believe -- I don't believe that there's a -- there's a 9 difference. 10 Any -- we have a system today where every 11 State has a drug substitution law that drives 12 prescriptions to be filled with generics rather than 13 name-brand products. We have a system where Medicare, 14 Medicaid, and insurers force or encourage the 15 substitution of generics through -- through price 16 incentives. If generics are not responsible, in many of 17 these cases no one is responsible. 18 The -- we -- the position that the generics 19 are proposing here is one in which they would be immune 20 from liability for selling a product with inadequate 21 warnings, even though the name-brand company selling the 22 same drug with the same warnings would be liable. There 23 is no suggestion anywhere in the record, Your Honor, 24 anywhere in the legislative history or in the text of 25 Hatch-Waxman or in FDA regulations that that distinction

I see my time has expired.

BOGRAD: There was no CBE equivalent in 16 Bates in the -- under the FIFRA statutory scheme, and 17 yet this Court upheld against a motion to dismiss on 18 preemption grounds a failure to warn claim, admittedly 19 under an express preemption provision. This Court 20 upheld a claim against a pesticide manufacturer even 21 though the pesticide manufacturer could not have changed 22 its warning without prior EPA approval, exactly the same 23 situation that confronts the generics here. 24 Thank you, Your Honor. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 6 please the Court: 7 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments were designed to 8 facilitate the entry of generic drugs onto the market. 9 They do not absolve a manufacturer of his 10 responsibilities after entry onto the market to maintain 11 the safety of the drug and the adequacy of -- of the 12 label. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kneedler, suppose 14 that I'm not sure I agree with you that there is an 15 obligation of the kind that you say for a generic drug 16 manufacturer to come forward and request a label, but I 17 do think that there's an opportunity for that 18 manufacturer to come forward and ask the FDA to revise a 19 label. If that's the way I read the law, does your 20 result follow? Do you think, then, that State law 21 claims should be able to go forward? 22 MR.

There was no - 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume that the 7 patient's physician has the same opportunity. Anybody 8 could go to the FDA and say this label ought to be 9 changed, right? So the -- the physician taking care of 10 this plaintiff didn't -- had the opportunity to go to 11 the FDA and didn't. Is there a cause of action against 12 him? 13 MR.

The whole point of the labeling - 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about what 17 the -- the FDCA regulation. We're talking about what 18 State law would allow, and State law would allow a suit 19 against the physician because he did not take advantage 20 of the opportunity to go to the FDA and propose a label 21 change. 22 MR. KNEEDLER: No, I think State law 23 would -- would impose an obligation on the physician to 24 adequately advise the patient, but what's so different 25 is, the physician relies upon the labeling. If the

1 physician has the information, the physician, on his own 2 initiative, could tell the patient or warn the patient 3 about what's going on without -- without having to go to 4 FDA at all. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if your theory of 6 the case is accepted, this is what will happen: Every 7 time a generic manufacturer gets an adverse incident 8 report, it will send that on to the FDA, and there will 9 be a boilerplate sentence at the end of it saying, We 10 think you should consider revising the labels because of 11 this, and then, under your theory, that manufacturer is 12 completely protected from State suits? 13 MR. KNEEDLER: Several things. The 14 manufacturer does, of course, have the obligation to 15 furnish the adverse event information that it receives. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure. 17 MR. KNEEDLER: But if -- if the standard in 18 regulation 57(e) is met, where there's evidence, 19 reasonable evidence, of a serious hazard, it has an 20 obligation - 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they're not 22 going to take a chance.

KNEEDLER: Yes, and we don't -- we don't 8 think it will lead to a flood of such requirements in 9 the wake of this - 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it lead to 11 preemption? 12 MR. KNEEDLER: Pardon me? 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it lead to 14 preemption? 15 MR. KNEEDLER: If the -- if FDA rejected the 16 request, there would -- there would be preemption, 17 because FDA -- it would have been submitted to the 18 expert agency, as we think is required. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Wouldn't 20 you -- if you were the generic company's lawyer, you 21 would advise them to do that in every case, right? 22 MR. KNEEDLER: I don't think I -- I don't 23 think in every case. I think it's -- if -- but here, 24 here we have a situation where, at least according to 25 the allegations, there were published studies of

1 long-term use of this product. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know that's 3 what this case is, but if -- a reasonable generic 4 manufacturer would be worried about every case, and it 5 would just add this boilerplate language at the end of 6 every letter, and as I understand your theory, they 7 would be protected. 8 MR. KNEEDLER: It's not just boilerplate 9 evidence at the bottom of the -- as part of a letter. 10 What the -- what the Federal Register notice told the 11 manufacturer to do was to -- was to submit the proposal 12 to FDA with supporting information. In other words, 13 suppose it's the sort of submission that would -- that 14 would be like - 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: That would be the -- the 16 prologue -- the prologue to the rule said that, and the 17 rule was never submitted for notice and comment. Is 18 that what you're relying on, that prologue? 19 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I think, to put it 20 in context, these were the regulations actually 21 implementing the Hatch-Waxman statute, and there was a 22 proposal to allow the manufacturers to deviate from 23 the -- from the NDA holders' label and put their own on 24 it. And the -- and FDA said, no, you can't do that, but 25 what you should do is bring it to FDA, and FDA will

1 decide whether to change the labels for everyone. 2 And so this was part and parcel of the 3 notice and comment rulemaking: How should -- how should 4 a generic manufacturer deal with a situation where it 5 has information that may deviate from the NDA 6 holder's -- how should it - 7 JUSTICE ALITO: Has the FDA made any 8 calculation of the economic consequences of imposing 9 this duty on generic drug manufacturers? I don't know 10 whether this is a good idea or not, but it does seem to 11 me that it may significantly increase the costs for 12 generic drug manufacturers, and therefore counteract one 13 of the objectives of the statute, which was to provide 14 generic drugs at a low cost. 15 MR. KNEEDLER: To my knowledge, FDA has not 16 done an analysis. But it's important to understand the 17 duty here derives from the misbranding provisions. A 18 generic drug manufacturer is not exempt from the 19 misbranding requirements of the act, which prohibit 20 distributing a drug that does not have adequate - 21 adequate warnings, and rule 57(e) requiring a 22 manufacturer to propose a warning or to make a warning 23 change if there is evidence of a serious hazard 24 implements that misbranding requirement. So this is not 25 an imposition by FDA. This is an underlying requirement

1 of the act. 2 I would - 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Am I -- am I to 4 understand -- and I think I am understanding you. There 5 is a legal obligation in the statute to report adverse 6 events. You're saying that the statute also requires 7 every manufacturer, of whatever type, to monitor the 8 safety of the drug they're selling? Is that what you're 9 saying? 10 MR. KNEEDLER: State - 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if reasonable 12 evidence, whether directly in their possession or in the 13 marketplace - 14 MR. KNEEDLER: The -- the FDA regulations do 15 not explicitly require monitoring of literature, but - 16 but there's no conflict in State law imposing a duty to 17 do that. 18 If I -- if I may just discuss Buckman for a 19 minute, because - 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you decide whether a 21 generic manufacturer ought to have proposed a -- a 22 labeling change? 23 MR. KNEEDLER: If the standard - 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is a generic 25 manufacturer. He doesn't know anything about -- about

1 science. He knows how to replicate this pill exactly. 2 That's all -- that's all he really knows. 3 Now, what is the test you're going to impose 4 to -- to a jury to decide whether this generic 5 manufacturer ought to have -- ought to have proposed a 6 labeling change? 7 MR. KNEEDLER: It's the - 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it, well, you 9 know, if he had been as well armed scientifically as the 10 original manufacturer of the labeled drug, he should 11 have known or, you know, does this guy who graduated 12 from high school and can replicate a pill, should he 13 have known? What -- what's the - 14 MR. KNEEDLER: It's the standard in 57(e) if 15 there's evidence of a serious hazard, we think State law 16 can impose on a generic manufacturer which is putting a 17 potentially dangerous product on the market the 18 obligation to -- to investigate. 19 I would -- I would like to talk about 20 Buckman for just a minute, please, because it's -- it's 21 come up. Buckman is fundamentally different. There was 22 no independent State law duty to warn at issue in 23 Buckman. It was solely a tort based on lying to the 24 FDA. It is a tort that depended entirely on the 25 existence of the FDA.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And in the brief - 2 and in the brief that you filed you said one of the 3 concerns is that people are going to flood the FDA with 4 all these warnings and -- and whatever, and that would 5 interfere with the FDA's ability. Now you're telling 6 me -- you -- you said when you started out that you 7 think it's unlikely or you don't think it's likely. In 8 your brief it said SG language you said we're not 9 prepared to predict that a ruling would do this. 10 So, why is that a difference between those 11 two cases? 12 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, Buckman was a situation 13 of a collateral attack on a decision that had actually 14 been made by FDA. There was no independent duty -15 State law or duty to warn, no relationship between the 16 person submitting information to FDA. It was just a 17 State making the tort to lie to the FDA, and you would 18 have had the State regulating nothing but the 19 relationship between the manufacturer and FDA. 20 Here State law is regulating the 21 relationship between the manufacturer and -- and the 22 patient through the doctor, and that's a traditional 23 area of State regulation, duty to warn, and, Justice 24 Kagan, I think you're right, the question then is 25 whether there is an affirmative defense of -- of
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 preemption, and the preemption comes in. It's very 2 different from Buckman in that situation. 3 It's up to the defendant to prove, it's not 4 an element of the cause of action as in Buckman. It's 5 part of the defense for the defendant to prove that - 6 that it is -- that the cause of action is preempted. 7 And in our view it's not preempted if the 8 standard in 57(e) is met to propose a labeling change 9 that is an obligation that extends to all manufacturers 10 generic or not. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's 12 not -- the regulation doesn't say propose a labeling 13 change. It says labeling shall be revised, and the one 14 thing we know is that the generic manufacturer can't 15 revise the labeling from the branded one. 16 MR. KNEEDLER: It can't revise the labeling, 17 but that doesn't mean it can do nothing. Impossibility 18 preemption kicks in only when it's genuinely impossible, 19 and if the manufacturer could go to FDA and propose a 20 labeling change, it is not impossible for to it do that. 21 At that point it's up to FDA and preemption would kick 22 in. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 24 Mr. Kneedler. 25 Mr. Lefkowitz, you have your 5 minutes

1 remaining. 2 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY P. LEFKOWITZ 3 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 4 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Thank you. 5 Mr. Kneedler has basically postulated a 6 situation where we're going to have jury trials about 7 whether a Federal duty to the FDA was breached. And 8 it's interesting, he says that this isn't Buckman, but 9 of course, Buckman involved the same duty not to sell a 10 dangerous product, and the same issue of lack of 11 disclosure to the FDA. 12 Now, he says it was a collateral attack, but 13 actually that was the premise of Justice Stevens' 14 concurrence, where Justice Stevens said I get to the 15 same result for a different reason. What the Court said 16 was nothing about a collateral attack. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the difference, 18 as I see it, is that they're not suing you for a failure 19 to tell the FDA. They're suing you for a failure to 20 tell them. It's you who are interposing a defense and 21 saying I manufacture a dangerous drug, and I have no 22 obligation to monitor and ensure that the label is 23 accurate. 24 And what the government is saying, as I 25 understand it is, no, you do. Yes, we understand you

1 want to sell more cheaply, but not at the cost of public 2 health. 3 So what's wrong with that argument? 4 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Sotomayor, 5 respectfully, what's wrong with the premises, if they're 6 claiming failure to warn, it's a very simple case of 7 impossibility preemption. We couldn't warn, and the 8 government's brief makes clear we had no ability to 9 warn. 10 What the government is now doing is it's 11 taking a regulation, 201.57, which doesn't say the word 12 "ask" in it. It actually says "revise." And it says 13 revise because it's a regulation written for brand 14 manufacturers that have the CBE option available to 15 them, and they are then trying to incorporate the words 16 "duty to ask" through this brief without, as Justice 17 Alito says, taking into any account through notice and 18 comment rulemaking the effect of this. 19 Well, we know that there are over 1,600 20 requests for labeling revisions pending at the FDA now, 21 650 of them are pending for more than 6 months. And at 22 the relevant time of this case, Your Honor, not only 23 would we have had to ask the FDA, but then the FDA would 24 have had to negotiate with the brand, because prior to 25 the FDAAA amendments, the FDA couldn't order a brand to
55

1 change, so we would have had to make the request, the 2 FDA would have had to negotiate the brand change, and 3 then we would have had to follow. 4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, if you 5 had asked, you would be in a different situation. If 6 you had asked and the FDA had sat on it or was 7 negotiating, then you could say, look, we've done all we 8 can right now. But you're not in that situation. You, 9 in fact, have not done all you can right now to change 10 the label because you never wrote that letter. 11 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, and again just 12 to pick up on -- on what Chief Justice Roberts said and 13 Justice Scalia said, we have done everything we are 14 required to do, which is to provide all of the 15 information about adverse reports that we have and all 16 of the results of our investigations to the government. 17 And if the government wants to impose a new duty through 18 notice and comment rulemaking saying, and now we have a 19 duty to ask for a label change, in addition - 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The government is taking 21 the position that there's no clash between the 22 government, the State, and Federal law. It's not saying 23 that you commit some kind of Federal offense if you 24 don't file this law. The government is saying, the 25 question is preemption. Is there a clash between
56

1 Federal and State law to traditional Federal warn you 2 have a preemption defense if you tell the FDA, and if 3 either the FDA does nothing or tells you, no, we're not 4 going to change the label? 5 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, Buckman makes 6 very clear that a State trying to regulate disclosure 7 obligations to the Federal Government is simply off 8 limits, and in fact - 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the -- Buckman was 10 about, was a -- it was a very odd case to be brought 11 under State law for fraud on a Federal agency. 12 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, it was a case 13 brought by a plaintiff who was injured claiming that the 14 company had not made proper, adequate disclosures to the 15 FDA. It's the same thing here, and I just want to 16 point - 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Lefkowitz, do you agree 18 with Justice Ginsburg's characterization of the 19 government's position? I thought the government was 20 saying that there was an obligation on the part of the 21 generics to propose changes. 22 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely. What they are 23 saying - 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Otherwise, the government 25 would be saying you have an obligation to lobby, and I
57

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 don't think they're saying that. 2 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, in a sense the 3 government is really saying we -- to lobby or to propose 4 changes is a -- is a very fine distinction. Clearly, 5 what the government is now saying is they are reading a 6 regulation that they've always interpreted as being only 7 applicable to brand companies and saying now it's 8 applicable to their companies and it incorporates new 9 language that says not just revise but ask. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 11 Mr. Lefkowitz. Counsel, the case is submitted. 12 (Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the 13 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
