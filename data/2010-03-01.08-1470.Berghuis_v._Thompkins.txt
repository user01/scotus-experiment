1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:03 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 4 argument first this morning in case 08-1470, 5 Berghuis v. Thompkins. 6 Mr. Restuccia. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF B. ERIC RESTUCCIA 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. RESTUCCIA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 10 it please the Court: 11 In rejecting Mr. Thompkins's Miranda claim 12 and ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the 13 Michigan courts did not unreasonably apply clearly 14 established Supreme Court precedent. I plan to focus on 15 the Miranda claim. 16 Now, with respect to the Miranda claim, there 17 really are two distinct inquiries at issue. The first 18 is whether Mr. Thompkins impliedly waived his rights 19 under the Fifth Amendment and, second, whether he 20 invoked his right to remain silent during a police 21 interview. 22 Regarding the waiver question, this Court 23 established in Butler that there may be an implied 24 waiver, even where a suspect remains silent after having 25 received his Miranda warnings, where that suspect
3 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 knowingly receives his rights and there is a course of 2 conduct that indicates waiver. 3 The Michigan courts here did not 4 unreasonably conclude that Mr. Thompkins had impliedly 5 waived his rights where he expressly acknowledged his 6 rights under -- from his form. After having read out loud 7 from that form, he participated in a limited fashion 8 during the interview. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he didn't -- he 10 didn't waive them. And quite unlike Butler -- Butler, 11 if I have it right, said, "I'll talk to you." So that 12 was a statement -13 MR. RESTUCCIA: But -14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that he was waiving 15 the right to remain silent. He volunteered to talk. 16 Here there was no such indication that there was a 17 waiver of his right to remain silent. 18 MR. RESTUCCIA: Although in Butler this 19 Court noted that -- that Butler himself had remained 20 silent and did not answer the -- answer at all, or 21 remained silent when asked whether he wished to waive 22 his right to counsel. So the -- the standard that was 23 established from which the Michigan courts relied is 24 really on this -- this language of the standard 25 established from Butler, that you can -- you can imply

1 waiver from the knowing reception, and then a course of 2 conduct, because the -- the inference can be drawn from 3 the words and actions of the person interrogated. And 4 here -5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me 6 without more detail, which is what the circuit court 7 said, about what the limited responses -- I'm using your 8 word -- were. How do we -- how can we imply waiver? 9 MR. RESTUCCIA: Well -10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Meaning if all he said 11 was, yes, I want them in, that's much different than 12 saying, if someone had asked him, do you want to leave, 13 and he shakes his head no. The latter might imply to me 14 that he waived, but the former certainly would be 15 neutral. 16 MR. RESTUCCIA: I have to 17 carefully delineate between waiver and invocation. So 18 here the waiver occurs at the time that he is asked the 19 series of questions: Do you believe in God? Do you 20 pray to God? Did you pray for forgiveness -21 JUSTICE BREYER: That happened about 2 22 hours and 15 minutes into the exercise, didn't it? 23 MR. RESTUCCIA: That's right. It happened 24 near the -25 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So -- so what we
5 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 have here is a course of conduct, 2 hours and 15 minutes 2 of saying nothing. 3 MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, we ­ 4 JUSTICE BREYER: Would you say that 5 that's -- that's gone past the point where -6 MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, this -- if you're 7 looking at what has been clearly established for this 8 Court, this Court has never -- I mean, one of the 9 arguments raised against the position I'm 10 advocating is that there is an immediacy requirement. 11 Well, this Court in Butler didn't say that the waiver 12 had to occur immediately. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: In Butler he said: I will 14 talk to you, but I am not signing any forms. 15 MR. RESTUCCIA: That's right. But if you 16 look at what's the clearly established law -- this Court 17 identified the standard, what can be inferred from the 18 words and actions of the person interrogated. And if 19 you look at what the two -20 JUSTICE BREYER: What they say is, "a course 21 of conduct" -- we will not hold -- "This does not mean a 22 defendant's silence, coupled with an understanding and a 23 course of conduct indicating waiver, may never support a 24 conclusion...." 25 MR. RESTUCCIA: Right.

1 JUSTICE BREYER: But the prosecution's 2 burden is great. 3 MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. And if -- if you 4 look at the two aspects of what constitutes a waiver, 5 it's knowing and intelligent, and voluntary. At the 6 time that Mr. Thompkins gave his answer to that series 7 of questions, there's nothing in the course of that 8 interview that suggested that no longer did he know that 9 he didn't have to answer questions. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: But going back to Justice 11 Sotomayor's question, is there anything during the 2 12 hours and 15 minutes that could suggest a waiver? 13 MR. RESTUCCIA: The -- the -- the waiver 14 occurs at the time that he answered the question. So the 15 answer is that he didn't waiver before then, but that -16 it still is evidence to show that that course -- that 17 nothing the police had done -- there were no threats -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do we do with 19 our case law that says that you can't infer waiver 20 simply from the confession? 21 MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, the -22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, we have said 23 that. So that's pretty clearly established statement -24 MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, the -25

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- by the Court. 2 MR. RESTUCCIA: The courts on direct review 3 have allowed -- where there's a knowing reception of 4 one's rights, have allowed the answers themselves to 5 provide the evidence that the person did waive his 6 rights. In fact -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I think certainly 8 in -- in Butler, if someone in their confession says, I 9 know I don't have to talk to you, but I want to, that 10 that would be using those words. 11 MR. RESTUCCIA: But that would be -12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how can you say -13 MR. RESTUCCIA: That would be an express 14 waiver, though. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How can you say that 16 an appeal to someone's religious position after 2 and 17 a quarter hours is a voluntary waiver? 18 MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, if you look at what 19 this Court has provided in terms of guidance regarding 20 what constitutes a lengthy interrogation, Miranda notes 21 that a lengthy interrogation would be strong evidence 22 against there being a valid waiver. But what 23 this Court has determined to be a lengthy interrogation 24 were interrogations of much longer duration. In fact, 25 Miranda even talks about --

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We didn't say -- we don't 2 have any decision that says the police are home free for 3 2 and a quarter hours. You said that that this was not 4 lengthy interrogation. 5 MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we -- we have no 7 decision that says that the police, faced with a silent 8 suspect, goes after that suspect, questioning him 9 incessantly for 2 and -- 2 hours and 15 minutes, that 10 that is not lengthy. 11 MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, I think it's important 12 to remember that the factual record here was established 13 by the State court, and the factual record isn't that he 14 remained absolutely silent, but that he participated -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He said "yeah," "no," and 16 "I don't know." 17 MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. But he was 18 participating. There's a fundamental difference between 19 remaining absolutely silent and participating -20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. Do -- do we have any 21 case that says that 2 and a quarter hours is too long? 22 MR. RESTUCCIA: No, and in fact -23 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that there can't be a 24 waiver after 2 and a quarter hours? 25 MR. RESTUCCIA: No, there's no case law to

1 that effect. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: And, therefore, there's no 3 clearly established Supreme Court law that 2 and a 4 quarter hours is too long. 5 MR. RESTUCCIA: That's the position that -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that the name of the 7 game here? 8 MR. RESTUCCIA: That's the position -9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there a clearly 10 established rule that in all of the circumstances of the 11 case, we can find that there is coercion, time being one 12 aspect of those circumstances? 13 MR. RESTUCCIA: I think that's right. And 14 what -- one of the -15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so that is a clearly 16 established rule, and then it's a question whether 2 and 17 a half, 3 and a half, 4 and a half suffices. 18 MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. The -- the case that 19 I cited was Frazier v. Cupp, in which the interview 20 started at 5:00 p.m. and it finished at 6:45 p.m., and 21 the Court called that an interrogation of short 22 duration. And it is important to remember that this 23 Court has stated expressly in Davis that once you have 24 knowingly received your rights, that the knowing 25 reception itself dispels the inherently coercive

1 aspect -2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The question -3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your -- your position 4 is that if -- same facts, but it's 10 hours instead of 5 2 and a half, is that a closer case, at least? For -6 MR. RESTUCCIA: That's a very different 7 case, because there is case law -- like I cited Blackburn 8 was an interview that ran 8 or 9 hours, and this Court 9 found that that person was probably incompetent or 10 insane. But that duration is -- there's been guidance 11 about that kind of long duration, whereas in our -12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And does that show that ­ 13 that the circumstances are coercive, so that even if there 14 were a waiver it would be -15 MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. That's the 16 suggestion from Miranda, that a lengthy interrogation 17 preceding the waiver can suggest the waiver was not 18 valid. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The question, of 20 course, is not whether we think 2 and a quarter hours 21 under all the circumstances is -- is too long under our 22 precedent. The question is, instead, whether it would be 23 unreasonable for the State court to determine otherwise. 24 MR. RESTUCCIA: That's right. And, ultimately, 25 the question is what guidance is there to the State of

1 Michigan in applying the implied waiver doctrine to 2 indicate that the implied waiver couldn't come after 2 3 hours and 15 minutes of interaction in which it 4 concluded that the -- that the suspect had been a 5 willing participant. The testimony from detective 6 Helgert, which -- he was the only person to testify at 7 the evidentiary hearing, is that -8 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought Miranda held that 9 you can't question a person unless he waives his right. 10 MR. RESTUCCIA: No, Miranda in fact talks 11 about -12 JUSTICE BREYER: You can question him even 13 after he -- it's clear that he hadn't waived his right. 14 Is that -- that's Miranda? Or at least that's unclear? 15 Is that -16 MR. RESTUCCIA: Warnings -- warnings is a 17 prerequisite to questioning, but the waiver is not. In 18 fact -19 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not talking about 20 the waiver. I'm saying, imagine that it's clear that a 21 person hasn't waived his right. Now let's suppose he 22 says, "I do not waive my right." Okay? 23 Now, is it clear law that once he says "I do 24 not waive my right," the police cannot continue to 25 question him?

1 MR. RESTUCCIA: If there is a -2 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that clear law, yes or 3 no? 4 MR. RESTUCCIA: Yes, that if there is -5 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, yes. If that's clear 6 law, would you say that at some point before the 2 hours 7 and 15 minutes expires where they're continuously asking 8 him questions and he says nothing, that it has become 9 clear that he has not waived his right? 10 MR. RESTUCCIA: No. The factual record -11 JUSTICE BREYER: For the question is not 12 this. The question is whether, after 2 hours and 13 15 minutes of silence, it is clear -- it's nothing about 14 Supreme Court law. Supreme Court law is clear: You 15 cannot question him after he makes clear he hasn't 16 waived his right. So then the question becomes, is it 17 reasonable for a State court to say -- after 2 hours and 18 15 minutes of asking questions and he says nothing, is 19 it reasonable to hold that he has not -- conclude that 20 he has not waived his rights? Is that the question? 21 MR. RESTUCCIA: Yes. The question as I see 22 it is that -- let me see if I understand. Let me see if 23 I understand your question. There's a difference 24 between refusing to waive, saying I will not waive my 25 rights. Essentially if you make it an expressed statement
13 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that you are unwilling to waive, then essentially it is 2 in that case -- I want to keep this separate, but that 3 would be an invocation: I do not wish to answer your 4 questions. If you make a crystal-clear statement like 5 that, it's a different question. 6 But here Mr. Thompkins didn't say he was 7 unwilling to waive. He's participating. Now, you 8 suggest that there was silence -9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're saying there's a 10 difference between a waiver and a failure to assert? 11 MR. RESTUCCIA: Yes, exactly. Here -- the 12 fact pattern here is he did not say "I am unwilling to 13 waive, I do not wish this interview to go forward." He 14 doesn't do that. He just doesn't assert -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You want to change the 16 Miranda rule to say: Tell someone their rights, and 17 unless they explicitly say "I don't want to talk to 18 you," then they implicitly under virtually any 19 circumstance haven't. That's what you believe the rule 20 in Miranda and Butler and Davis sets forth? 21 MR. RESTUCCIA: Butler states that where 22 there was silence after the provision of the Miranda 23 warnings, silence, that where the subsequent conduct, 24 where knowing reception of rights and the course of 25 conduct indicates waiver --
14 Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There wasn't -- there wasn't 2 silence in Butler. There was an express "I want to 3 talk to you." 4 MR. RESTUCCIA: I understand that's the facts 5 of Butler. But the standards by which all the courts 6 are operating, including the Michigan court, are the 7 standards articulated by Butler. Butler says that the 8 waiver can be inferred from the words and actions of the 9 person interrogated, indicating that the -10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My -- but we go back to the 11 point you made earlier. Your position is the moment 12 that someone confesses, that's an implicit waiver. 13 MR. RESTUCCIA: No, because there could have 14 been actions taken by the police during the course of 15 this interview. There were no threats. There were no 16 improper promises. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand how this 18 person could just sit there for 2 hours and didn't want 19 to be interrogated and doesn't say: You know, I don't 20 want to answer your questions. He just sits there, and 21 some questions he doesn't answer. And he does make a 22 few comments, anyway. 23 MR. RESTUCCIA: That's right. 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why shouldn't we have a 25 rule which simply says if you don't want to be

1 interrogated, all you have to say is "I don't want to 2 answer your questions"? 3 MR. RESTUCCIA: Mr. Thompkins -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's nice and clear, 5 wouldn't be any problem at all. That was never said 6 here. He, in fact, submitted to having these questions 7 asked of him. 8 MR. RESTUCCIA: I think that that kind of 9 cuts to the nub of what Miranda says. Miranda says that 10 ultimately the statement has to be the free election of 11 the suspect. And here when Mr. Thompkins answered the 12 series of questions, he knew that he didn't have to 13 answer those questions, and nothing the police had done 14 during the course of the interview had undermined the 15 provision of rights, because it's those two aspects 16 which are the core, the knowing and intelligent and when 17 it's voluntary. Nothing the police had done had 18 undermined -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why should the police have 20 to play this game of, you know, an hour and a half, 21 2 hours, 2 hours and 15 minutes, 5 hours, 7 hours? 22 Why don't we have just a clear rule: You're read your 23 rights; if you don't want to be questioned all you have 24 to say is: I don't want to be questioned. 25 MR. RESTUCCIA: I think that's right, that here

1 Mr. Thompkins at any point could have said: I want 2 to stop" -3 JUSTICE BREYER: What would you do with 4 Miranda's statement "But a valid waiver will not be 5 presumed simply from the silence of the accused" -- I 6 grant you, as modified in Butler to say that the State 7 has a heavy burden of showing that the silence followed 8 by a confession -- the State has a heavy burden of 9 showing that that is an affirmative waiver. Now, those 10 I think are the two statements of law, the third being 11 that after, if there is no waiver, the police cannot 12 continue to question. Now, I thought that was the clear 13 law. 14 MR. RESTUCCIA: It's a -15 JUSTICE BREYER: I grant you, you might argue 16 for a change in the law. 17 MR. RESTUCCIA: But -- but this language from 18 Miranda that says the silence of the accused after 19 warnings are given would not be sufficient, that's 20 right, but Butler then fully explained. And think about 21 the State courts are coming in that they then -- this 22 Court then made clear that even silence after having 23 received Miranda warnings -- that if you knowingly 24 receive your rights and there is a course of conduct 25 that indicates waiver, that there can be a waiver.

1 That's exactly what the Federal courts have done on 2 direct review. 3 Now, thinking about the Michigan courts and 4 trying to determine what's -- how these rules are to be 5 applied, the Federal courts have found, in the absence of a 6 waiver, where a suspect knowingly receives his rights 7 and then answers questions implicating himself, that the 8 answers themselves can serve as the basis for the 9 finding of a waiver. 10 That's what the -- the conclusion that Mr. 11 Thompkins waived here is a reasonable one. It's not 12 objectively unreasonable. And, of course, you have to 13 recall the overarching habeas law that governs this, 14 that not just does a Michigan court decision have to 15 be incorrect, it has to be objectively unreasonable. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any difference 17 between -- between waiving your right and a failure to 18 assert your right? 19 MR. RESTUCCIA: Yes, there is a difference, 20 that here Mr. Thompkins did not assert his right. He 21 did not -22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is every failure to assert 23 a waiver? 24 MR. RESTUCCIA: No, because at the point -25 the point at which Mr. Thompkins waived is when he acts

1 inconsistent with the exercise of his rights. When he 2 answers questions knowing that he doesn't have to 3 answer, that is the waiver. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about before that? 5 What is happening before that? 6 MR. RESTUCCIA: Before -- in that -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: He hasn't asserted his 8 right. I mean, he hasn't said I -9 MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. So what happens is 10 he has not waived and he has not invoked. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: He has done neither. 12 MR. RESTUCCIA: He has does neither. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: He has neither waived nor 14 asserted. 15 MR. RESTUCCIA: And there's nothing -- the 16 way the Miranda rule works is that the waiver is a -- is 17 a prerequisite for the -- for admission of the evidence, but 18 not for the interrogation itself. So what happens is the -19 well, if there are no further questions, I'd like to 20 reserve my remaining time for rebuttal. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 24 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 25 AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER

Official
1 MS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 2 please the Court: 3 Respondent's confession was properly 4 admitted at his trial. I'd like to go right to some 5 of the questions that this Court had about the language 6 that was used in the Miranda decision and in the Butler 7 decision. Both -- all of this language comes up in 8 Butler. Now, Butler was a case not about the waiver of 9 the right to silence, but a waiver of the right to 10 counsel. So the suspect said "I will talk to you," but 11 the North Carolina Supreme Court said: Well, we don't 12 know if he waived his right to counsel, and that's why 13 the court got into a question of implied waiver. 14 So the Court in its analysis in Butler first 15 reviewed this language that the Court has talked about 16 this morning from Miranda that says "A valid waiver will 17 not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused 18 or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact 19 eventually obtained." 20 And this is our understanding of that language: 21 First, it is not the case that a failure to invoke Miranda 22 rights will be taken in the Miranda context as a waiver. 23 Now, Justice Scalia, I think you 24 alluded to the fact that the normal rule for the Fifth 25 Amendment at trial is that you assert your rights or

1 they are waived. But Miranda's an exception to that, 2 that the failure to assert we are not going to take as a 3 waiver. The government has to do something more. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So do you read -- yes. So 5 do you read Miranda as saying that there cannot be 6 questioning unless there is a waiver? Then we'll go 7 on to -- or do you -8 MS. SAHARSKY: No. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay, you do not. 10 MS. SAHARSKY: No. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So are you going to go on -12 because this is right where you are. Are you going to go on 13 to say that, in the Miranda context, the failure to assert 14 can -- can suffice to allow the questioning to proceed? 15 MS. SAHARSKY: As long as the warnings are 16 given, the accused has been told of his rights, and that 17 the police will respect his rights, and questioning can 18 proceed. The Court said in Davis and said in other 19 cases, Moran versus Burbine, that the primary protection 20 afforded by Miranda is to level the playing field by 21 letting the accused know of his rights and that the 22 police will respect them. And after the point that he 23 gets his rights and understands them, the police can 24 question him. You'd have to overrule Butler to say that 25 there has to be a waiver before any questioning.

1 Just to get back to the second thing that 2 the Court said in Miranda that was picked up in Butler, 3 it said: We are not going to assume that there is a 4 waiver simply from the fact that a confession was 5 eventually obtained; there is a burden on the 6 government. 7 And the way that we understand that is that 8 the government can't just go into court and say: Look, 9 we have a confession; we know he waived his rights. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But why isn't that 11 language that you quote a negative inference that there 12 must be a waiver? 13 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, if you look back at the 14 language -- the other language in Miranda, it says that a 15 waiver is a prerequisite to the admission of the 16 evidence at trial. We know that to be able to use that 17 evidence we have to know that he made a knowing and 18 intelligent and voluntary decision to talk. But that 19 he -- that doesn't mean he has to make the decision to 20 talk right away. He might want to listen to what the 21 police have to say about the benefits of cooperation or 22 the evidence that they have in his case. And that -23 those are the kinds of things the police could say that 24 could be understood to be custodial interrogation. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So there's a difference
22 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 between waiving at the time of the interrogation and 2 then waiving it at the time of trial? I don't 3 understand that. 4 MS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to 5 suggest that. What I'm saying is at the time the 6 Respondent makes his statements, that waiver -- there has 7 to be a waiver and it has to be a knowing, intelligent, 8 and voluntary one. That at the time he makes his 9 statement -- here when he admitted that he shot the boy 10 down, he had to understand what his rights were and 11 there had -- those statements had to not be the result 12 of police coercion. 13 And no court here has found that they were the 14 result of police coercion. There is no question about 15 voluntariness here. 16 So what we understand this language in 17 Butler to mean about an implied waiver is the fact of a 18 confession itself is not enough to show the government 19 has met its burden. When the Court talked about a 20 course of conduct, it talked about the same standard 21 that it's always used in the Miranda context, that came 22 up again recently in this Court's decision in Shatzer, 23 which is that the ultimate question is a knowing, 24 intelligent, and voluntary waiver. 25 The course of conduct doesn't mean anything

1 more than that. It means that at the time the guy 2 spoke -3 JUSTICE STEVENS: But in this case, it was 4 the fact of the concession -- the confession that 5 constituted the waiver. 6 MS. SAHARSKY: That shows that he decided to 7 talk, but the confession itself isn't enough. We needed 8 to have -- the State needed to have evidence that he 9 understood his rights, which he said he did, and that there 10 was -- that the confession was not the product of police 11 coercion. 12 And I think that that comes through directly 13 in the language that's at issue in Butler. The Court 14 said "an express written or oral statement of waiver" -15 to remain silent or the right to counsel -- "is strong proof 16 of the validity of the waiver but not inevitably necessary.... 17 The question is not one of form, but whether the 18 defendant, in fact, knowingly and voluntarily waived the 19 rights delineated in Miranda." 20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I just want to make 21 sure where we are. 22 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're not -- you're conceding, 24 it seems to me, that there must be a waiver? 25 MS. SAHARSKY: Before the evidence can be

SAHARSKY: Yes. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why don't we tell the 9 police, there must be a waiver before you can continue 10 to interrogate? 11 MS. SAHARSKY: That would -- that would 12 exact a substantial price on law enforcement, and that's 13 the exact argument that Justice Brennan made in the 14 Butler case that was rejected. He was in dissent in 15 that case. He said the police should always have to -16 have to seek a waiver before they interrogate. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know why you 18 didn't answer Justice Stevens's questions by saying, 19 Justice Stevens, I don't care about waiver. There was 20 no -- there was no assertion of the right. 21 But you're not saying that. You are 22 admitting there has to be a waiver. 23 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. To admit the evidence 24 at trial, there has to be a waiver. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Why do you say it would

1 change the police's behavior? Inbau and Reid and, you 2 know, the -- the NAC -- the Defense Lawyers' brief here is 3 filled with quotations from typical police manuals, and 4 they all seem to say things like you have to have at -5 once the waiver is given, the police may proceed with 6 interrogation. That seems to be what police today are 7 instructed across the country. 8 It says you cannot question people until he 9 indicates after the warning is given a willingness to 10 answer questions. That's the police manual. 11 So why do you say this would extract a price 12 on law enforcement when the typical police manuals seem 13 to say what the Petitioner here is saying? 14 MS. SAHARSKY: Not every police -15 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean the Respondent. 16 MS. SAHARSKY: -- manual says that. That 17 brief itself cites many examples going both ways. 18 It is often the case, and it is often the 19 case in Federal law enforcement, that the police try to 20 seek a waiver immediately after giving rights because we 21 want to avoid the problems of proof that come up at 22 trial if we don't have a written waiver. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Which -- which are the 24 police manuals that go your way? Because I want to look 25 at those, too.

1 MS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry, I don't -- I don't 2 have the specific citations from the brief. I -- I know 3 from asking the Federal law enforcement agencies -- DHS, 4 the FBI, and the DEA -- that the DEA does not invariably 5 seek a waiver and that we don't understand that we need 6 to get an immediate waiver. 7 And, again, that was what Justice Brennan 8 said in -- in dissent in Butler, is that the police should have 9 to seek an immediate waiver. And the Court said, no, 10 the Fifth Amendment right is -- compel -- about compelled 11 statements being introduced at trial. We don't need 12 this protection, that the police have to seek an immediate 13 waiver. In fact, if you adopted a rule like that, it 14 would essentially take any burden off the suspect to 15 invoke his rights. 16 He wouldn't need to invoke his rights, 17 because the police would just -- if the police didn't 18 seek a waiver. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're saying 20 there -- there's a difference, I -- I assume, between 21 not waiving and positively asserting your right not to 22 be interrogated? 23 MS. SAHARSKY: That's exactly right. If the 24 person -25 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, if -- if he had -- here
27 Alderson Reporting Company

1 he simply refused to sign the -- the Miranda form, 2 right? 3 MS. SAHARSKY: That's right. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which would have -- which 5 would been the -- the waiver. And -- and you're saying 6 it's his later behavior that -- that showed that, in 7 fact, he waived. What if instead of just refusing to 8 sign, he had said, I do not want to be interrogated? 9 MS. SAHARSKY: Then the interrogation stops. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 11 MS. SAHARSKY: And that -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so he has the right 13 to terminate the whole thing by asserting his right. If 14 he neither asserts the right nor grants the waiver, the 15 police can continue to try to obtain a statement from 16 him? 17 MS. SAHARSKY: Right. A contrary rule would 18 have to overrule Butler, because the Court said you can 19 clearly infer waiver from the actions and words of the 20 person interrogated. That assumes that the person is 21 being interrogated. Just to talk a minute about the -22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there also assumes 23 there has to be a waiver. 24 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes, at the time that the 25 person makes the inculpatory statements that are going
28 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 at be introduced at trial, it must be the case that he 2 decided he was going to talk to the police knowingly, 3 intelligently, and voluntarily. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. As I read 5 this transcript, the police's tactic, by their own 6 statement, was to approach him and say: This is our 7 evidence. Explain yourself -- that's the words 8 the officer used -- but he's entitled to an alternative 9 explanation. Tell us. 10 What's clear is that at no point did he 11 answer those questions, because nothing about the nods 12 of the head or anything else showed a willingness to 13 confess. 14 And even in the responses he gave, he 15 answered a series of questions with a "yes," but not with 16 an explanation, which was what was being requested. 17 So my question is, how does one infer a 18 voluntary statement from a situation in which someone's 19 really not talking? I've never understood how a yes or 20 a nod to questions that don't -- that's what the circuit 21 said, to questions that we don't know what they were 22 about -- do you want a mint or not, I don't even know 23 that -- can reflect voluntariness? 24 And I understand that in Butler when someone 25 says I don't want to sign that, but I'm going to spill
29 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 my guts now, and does, that's a course of conduct one 2 could view as voluntary. 3 MS. SAHARSKY: Right. And we say that the 4 waiver occurred at the time he answered the questions 5 about his belief in God. And it doesn't matter what he 6 said in response to the earlier questions, as long as at the 7 time that he answered questions about God, his decision 8 to talk was a knowing and intelligent and voluntary one. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless, I assume, that 10 you -- you -- you acknowledge that if the interrogation 11 had go on -- had gone on for so long that it had become 12 coercive, then that -- that -- that last statement would 13 not -- would not be a voluntary waiver. 14 MS. SAHARSKY: That's right. But Respondent 15 made a voluntariness argument throughout all of the 16 courts in this case, and every court has rejected it. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 18 Ms. Saharsky. 19 Ms. Jacobs. 20 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH L. JACOBS 21 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 22 MS. JACOBS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 23 please the Court: 24 When I review Miranda, I find language from 25 Miranda that says that you have to have a -- an advice
30 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 of rights and a waiver before you question. And I just 2 want to direct the Court to page 475 of Miranda: 3 Requirement of warnings and waiver is a fundamental 4 aspect of the Fifth Amendment privilege and not simply a 5 preliminary ritual to existing interrogation methods. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What happens when 7 you read Butler? 8 MS. JACOBS: Butler, I think, is an 9 interesting case, because Butler is mostly aimed at the 10 right to counsel. When you talk about the right to 11 counsel and the right to remain silent, you have really 12 two different kinds of rights. And there's an 13 assertion requirement in the right to counsel. You 14 can't exercise that right without getting some help from 15 the police. 16 But the right to remain silent -- we don't 17 require that it be asserted. It is a presumption. And 18 that presumption remains. 19 JUSTICE ALITO: Your argument is that you 20 can infer waiver of the right to counsel from conduct, 21 but you can't infer waiver of the right to remain silent 22 from conduct? 23 MS. JACOBS: Essentially, yes. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your best authority 25 for that proposition?
31 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MS. JACOBS: Let me make sure that I -- that 2 I said yes to the right thing. 3 You can -- I do -- you can take an implied 4 waiver of the -- of the right to silence. I -- I do 5 agree with that. And I look at the cases that have been 6 cited, and I know that there are three kinds of examples. 7 One is the person walks into the police 8 Station, and he says I want to confess. That's a 9 voluntary confession. You don't have to assert 10 anything. He's -- he's going to confess. 11 If you have a steady stream of speech in 12 which he says, I don't want to talk but I'll tell you 13 about this, again, you have somebody acting voluntarily. 14 Someone who says I'll only talk about drugs 15 but I'm not going to talk about murder -- he's implied 16 he's waived his right to that. 17 But in this case, when you look at this 18 case, the key issue really is was it volitional? What 19 fact would lead a court to decide that there -- that my 20 client -21 JUSTICE ALITO: So, basically what you're 22 saying is that if the defendant here had said at the 23 beginning, I don't know whether I -- I want to talk 24 to you or not, but I'm going to listen to your questions 25 and I might answer some and I might answer others -- that
32 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 would be a different case? 2 MS. JACOBS: Yes, absolutely. You have an 3 implied waiver. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: And where is there -- what 5 Supreme Court case establishes the distinction between 6 those two situations clearly? 7 MS. JACOBS: Well, Davis is a case that 8 talks about the assertion of the right to counsel, but 9 does not apply to the right to remain silent. So I 10 think as long as you still have the presumption of -11 the presumption of the privilege against 12 self-incrimination as a presumptive right, the police 13 have to do something to move you off square one in order 14 to make it voluntary. 15 Am I answering your question, Justice Alito? 16 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm not sure I really 17 understand. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what you -19 what you need to make "it," it depends on what "it" is. 20 If -- if you mean the ultimate confession, I think I 21 don't agree. Ultimately, if he confesses and hasn't 22 been coerced, it's voluntary. 23 But if by the "it" you mean to make the 24 continuation of the interrogation voluntary, that's a 25 different question. And I don't know that our cases
33 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 establish that you cannot continue the interrogation 2 until there has been a waiver. 3 MS. JACOBS: Well, Justice Scalia, I just 4 read you page 475 from Miranda that says the requirement 5 is warnings and waiver, and that's not, as they said, a 6 preliminary ritual. That means more. Seibert -- and I 7 know it's a preliminary -- a plurality -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: But does that make it clear 9 that -- that there has to be a waiver before the 10 interrogation can continue? And if it does, how does it 11 square with Butler? 12 MS. JACOBS: Again, Butler is really a right 13 to counsel case. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: They're both under -15 they're both under Miranda. Both of those rights are 16 Miranda rights. 17 MS. JACOBS: In Butler the -- the waiver, 18 the voluntary act of the person being interrogated 19 really occurred very, very early. There wasn't any kind 20 of a gap. He said, I don't -- I believe he said, I 21 don't want to -- I don't want to do something in 22 writing, but I'll talk to you. 23 Now, that is a voluntary act: I'm going to 24 talk to you. That is clearly a waiver. That isn't 25 what we've got in this case. You have a young man who is
34 Alderson Reporting Company

1 sitting in a chair, looking at the ground; he's sullen. 2 The only time he looks at the officer is when the 3 officer directs him to look. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: I thought your answer was 5 that there does not have to be a waiver before 6 questioning can occur. 7 MS. JACOBS: No, there must be a waiver. 8 There's no such thing as -9 JUSTICE ALITO: There must be -10 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, Miranda does not say 11 that. I mean, I think -- I think that Justice Scalia is 12 right on that, that Miranda doesn't say you can't 13 question him. The pages that you read to us say that if 14 you have a lengthy questioning, then the fact that he 15 then gives a statement cannot be taken as a -- cannot be 16 admitted. That's -- that's what it seems to say on page 17 476 -18 MS. JACOBS: Okay. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: -- in the absence of some 20 special circumstance. 21 MS. JACOBS: In this case, because it went -22 because the interrogation lasted so long -23 JUSTICE BREYER: Am I right? I mean Miranda 24 does not explicitly say that you cannot continue 25 questioning. Am I right about that?

1 MS. JACOBS: Um -2 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm asking because I don't 3 know. I didn't see it in the -4 MS. JACOBS: And I -- and I want to answer 5 you with what -- what I read. "The requirement of warnings 6 and waiver is fundamental." My argument is that you cannot 7 continue to question someone who has not waived the 8 right, that there's -9 JUSTICE ALITO: So, what if the person says: 10 I'm not waiving, but I'm not saying that I will never 11 waive. I'll listen to your questions. 12 MS. JACOBS: I think you've got a waiver. 13 JUSTICE ALITO: When he says -14 MS. JACOBS: You've got a waiver. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: -- I'm not waiving? 16 MS. JACOBS: But he's willing to talk to the 17 police. In my case, Mr. Thompkins was unwilling. He 18 could -- he would not look at anybody. He would not 19 answer questions. We don't know what the "I don't know" 20 and the "yeah" was to. So that's a very -- my case is a 21 very different case than what you are proposing. There 22 is no willingness to engage with the police; there is, in 23 fact, this feeling that there is coercion going on. The 24 longer that interrogation -25 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I interrupt? Before I

1 can understand your case, I would like to understand 2 this hypothetical. If the person says: I'm not waiving, 3 but I'm not telling you that I won't waive at some point 4 in the future. I'll listen to your questions. 5 MS. JACOBS: I think he is engaging in a 6 conversation. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: That's a waiver. 8 MS. JACOBS: I think he's engaging in a 9 conversation with the police and that the police at that 10 point can continue to talk. But that isn't what 11 happened in this case. There was no indication by my 12 client that he wanted to listen, that he wanted to talk. 13 The longer that interrogation lasted, the more -14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he -- he didn't say 15 anything. You -- I think you could say that his conduct 16 implied the very kind of statement that Justice Alito 17 suggested in his hypothetical: I'll listen to you guys 18 for a while. 19 MS. JACOBS: What is key, I think, in your 20 -- in your hypothetical and in Justice Alito's 21 hypothetical, is that you have a defendant that feels 22 comfortable, that is not being oppressed by this 23 coercive atmosphere. My client did not engage in 24 anything, and the longer he sat there, the greater the 25 chances that anything he said was the product of

1 coercion. 2 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I -- just refresh my 3 recollection. In the record in this case, do we know 4 whether he said he understood his rights? 5 MS. JACOBS: Justice Stevens, that's kind of 6 iffy. The police officer -7 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because that was present 8 in Butler. 9 MS. JACOBS: Yes, the police officer in this 10 case said either "I don't remember whether I asked him" or 11 "I think he nodded that he understood." I don't think 12 we've got a real solid proof of that. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: It was read to him. 14 MS. JACOBS: Yes, it was read to him. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: And they had him read a 16 portion of the Miranda warning. 17 MS.

JACOBS: You need -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, he -- he's 10 listening when -- when they read it to him. He -- he -11 he can read it himself. 12 MS. JACOBS: You are presuming that a 13 defendant thinks that they've got the kind of power to 14 look at a police officer and say, "I don't want to talk 15 to you. Remove me." 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe -- maybe he doesn't 17 want to talk for the moment, but he does want to listen. 18 I'm not sure you're doing defendants a great -- a great 19 favor. I mean, some of them might want to listen to -20 to the police telling them, you know, by the way, your 21 co-conspirator is singing like a bird and he's trying to 22 pin it all on you, and maybe, you know, if -- if you 23 don't want to get left holding the bag, maybe you'd better 24 to talk to us and tell us what really happened. 25 I'm not sure that -- that if I were there,

1 even if I didn't want to talk right now, I might still 2 want to listen, which is apparently what this -- what 3 this person did. He could have said, I don't want to -4 I don't want talk. 5 And it -- and it would have ended. That 6 would have been an assertion of his right. He didn't 7 assert his right, but -8 MS. JACOBS: What -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- he -- he sat there and 10 listened. Now, maybe he wanted to find out what the 11 police would have to say to him. 12 MS. JACOBS: There is nothing in -- on this 13 record that indicates that he wanted to listen to them 14 as opposed to what Justice Alito's hypothetical is, 15 where the gentleman says: Well, I'm not going to say 16 anything, but I want to hear what you have to say. We 17 don't have that here. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we have it to 19 the extent that he was told he had right to remain 20 silent and he didn't say, I'm not going to talk to you. 21 MS. JACOBS: There's no clearly established 22 law that says that he has to assert his right to remain 23 silent. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it there any 25 clearly established law the other way, which is the
40 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 pertinent question? 2 MS. JACOBS: I think that because there is 3 the presumption of the -- the privilege is a presumptive 4 right, that he does not have to assert it. This is -5 this is -- the right, or the privilege against 6 self-incrimination, the constitutional command, is the 7 one right that really defines our criminal justice 8 system. It means that you cannot talk to -- the police 9 do not have the right to talk to the defendant. It 10 makes us an accusatorial system -11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're not talking 12 -- we're not talking about the Fifth Amendment right. 13 We're talking about the Miranda warnings. There's no 14 issue of voluntariness in this case. Right? 15 MS. JACOBS: Well, when -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no 17 suggestion that there's -- that the statements are not 18 voluntary. The suggestion is that they may have 19 violated Miranda. 20 MS. JACOBS: Right. That's correct. But if 21 you are going to adopt the suggestion of the government 22 that you do pre-interrogation waiver, which I think is 23 what we're talking about -- that is, you don't give him 24 his rights and then you can just talk and talk 25 until you are blue in the face, that that ends up being
41 Alderson Reporting Company

1 a more coercive situation than we have now. 2 This is the kind of situation that could 3 have been easily resolved just by the officer asking Mr. 4 Thompkins, do you want to talk to us? Instead, once 5 they establish -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if he said, do 7 you want to remain silent? 8 MS. JACOBS: He could -- that's fine. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And he doesn't 10 answer either one. 11 MS. JACOBS: Then -- then he's not 12 cooperating. He's not waiving his rights. It's not 13 voluntary. Take him back to the cell, that's it. 14 Because the police -15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you're saying then 16 that the defendant has to -- never has to invoke his 17 right? That -18 MS. JACOBS: The state of the -- the state 19 of the law is a defendant does not have to invoke his 20 right to remain silent. Davis is the invocation case; 21 it applies to the second stage of -- of the 22 interrogation. And it has to do with -23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was the Miranda warning 24 adequate in this case? He got the four warnings, but 25 then, unlike some police forms that then ask the
42 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 defendant, do you waive your rights, this form never 2 asked, did you waive your rights? It just said: Do you 3 acknowledge that we have informed you of your rights? 4 MS. JACOBS: That's correct, Justice 5 Ginsburg. That's all that form said. And what the 6 officer said is once Mr. Thompkins would not sign it, he 7 then moved into interview mode. There was no 8 further -- if this was an ambiguous act to him, then the 9 officer should have asked a clarifying question. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say you don't 11 have to invoke your rights, but Butler also says that 12 you can impliedly waive them. You don't have to 13 expressly waive them. 14 MS. JACOBS: I'm saying you don't have to 15 invoke the right to remain silent, that that's not the 16 state of the law, that only the right to remain -- I'm 17 sorry -- the right to counsel must be invoked. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. So the 19 question under AEDPA -- you agree there can be an implied 20 waiver; that's what Butler says, right? So the question 21 under AEDPA is whether the State court was unreasonable 22 to determine that there was an implied waiver on these 23 facts? 24 MS. JACOBS: The State actually found two -25 I think you're saying that there was an objectively
43 Alderson Reporting Company

1 unreasonable determination of the facts in this case? 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 3 MS. JACOBS: And I think that -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe. 5 MS. JACOBS: It's one way or the other. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 7 MS. JACOBS: And I think clearly that there 8 -- that there were facts that the Michigan Court of 9 Appeals found that were not supported by the record and 10 were objectively unreasonable. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What are those? 12 MS. JACOBS: The Sixth Circuit found that 13 when the Michigan Court of Appeals said the defendant 14 continued to talk with officers, the Sixth Circuit said 15 that that was an objectively unreasonable finding 16 because there was no continuation, there was no talking. 17 They also found unreasonable that the defendant talked 18 with officers sporadically. The Sixth Circuit said that 19 that was a misrepresentation of the record. 20 The last fact that they talked about is the 21 Michigan Court of Appeals said that the defendant made 22 eye contact several times or a number of times. And the 23 Sixth Circuit said, quote -- this is what the -- they 24 said that that was incorrect. What the officer said at 25 the hearing is that eye contact came only at the end,
44 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 one of the very -- one of the very first times came only 2 at the end. 3 So -- but those are important facts. The 4 fact that he was not continuing to talk -- he wasn't 5 talking at all. How do you find this -- this 6 voluntariness, that the rights are waived -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, those facts are 8 relevant only if we accept your -- your principal assertion, 9 which is that you -- you don't have to invoke the right and 10 interrogation must cease immediately. If we agree with 11 that, then all of these facts become relevant. But if 12 we think that, until you invoke the right, the police can 13 continue to ask you questions and it's up to you to 14 answer or not, then those facts are really not relevant 15 at all, are they? 16 I think that's true. 17 MS. JACOBS: I don't want to say it's true 18 -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't meant to be a 20 trick question. 21 MS. JACOBS: -- just because you are asking 22 it. 23 If you invoke those -- if you invoke -- if 24 you hold that he has to invoke those rights. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: On your theory, those --
45 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 those factual things are irrelevant, whether -2 MS. JACOBS: Well, my theory is that you 3 don't get past the failure to get the waiver. 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly, exactly. 5 MS. JACOBS: Yes. 6 Returning now to -- to the idea of the 7 pre-interrogation waiver, I would suggest to the Court 8 that that would return this -- this Court back to the 9 kind of test that Miranda stopped, which was the 10 applying the totality of the circumstances test, and 11 that you would then, again, revert to pre-Miranda law, 12 where -- and this I believe is what the Wayne County 13 prosecutor amicus wants to do, is just apply totality of 14 the -- the circumstances test to whether in fact someone 15 has waived their rights. And I would suggest to you that 16 Miranda has not been a failure, that this bright-line rule -17 you give the rights, you get the waiver, then can you talk -18 that that's -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I must say I've never 20 understood that to be the law, and I don't think it's 21 generally understood to be the law, that unless you get 22 a waiver right at the outset, you have to -- you have to 23 terminate interrogation. I think there are a lot of 24 police departments that don't -- I've never understood 25 that to be the rule.

1 MS. JACOBS: Justice Scalia, the opposite of 2 that then becomes the ability to keep the defendant in a 3 room, and the longer -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not saying it isn't a 5 good rule. It may be a good rule. But the issue here 6 is whether it is so clearly established that it was 7 unreasonable for the State court to think otherwise. 8 MS. JACOBS: And we would just suggest that 9 the State court applied Moseley incorrectly and applied 10 Miranda, that those are the clearly established law 11 in that case. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I like clear rules. Your 13 rule is a clear one. Another clear one would be just 14 the opposite of yours; that is, that interrogation can 15 continue unless he asserts his right. That's another 16 clear rule. We can go either way, and it will be clear. 17 MS. JACOBS: But if interrogation continues, 18 the longer it continues the less likely that the 19 statement that is taken is going to be the product of my 20 client's free will. So the government is going to have 21 an even greater burden in trying to prove that this 22 statement was voluntary or that the waiver of rights is 23 voluntary. 24 So this Court should not adopt a 25 pre-interrogation waiver rule, especially not one

1 that -- that ends up being as long as this case is, and 2 just in case -3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me when 4 the police have to stop? They read somebody their 5 rights; the person says nothing. Are you saying at that 6 point they have to stop? 7 MS. JACOBS: I think that they can say to 8 the person: Do you now want to waive your right and 9 talk to us or do you want to remain silent? I think 10 that that's an easy and expedient answer. If -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: But he doesn't answer. He 12 just sits there -13 MS. JACOBS: Then that's it. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- impassively. 15 MS. JACOBS: Then that's it. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Then they have to stop? 17 MS. JACOBS: There's no burden -- I mean, 18 then the burden isn't met, this heavy burden that he 19 has knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived 20 those rights. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't see how you 22 square that with Moseley. 23 MS. JACOBS: Well, Moseley says that the 24 longer that you question someone, that -- Moseley is the 25 persistent questioning case, where you keep questioning

1 the guy and questioning the guy. And this is very 2 clearly a Moseley case. You've got two officers in that 3 room, and they talk about the fact that they are both 4 questioning and they talk about the different themes 5 they used. And the very fact that they had to change 6 themes showed that the defendant was not being 7 cooperative and not -- and was not engaging in this 8 conversation willingly. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And all he has to 10 do is say: I don't want to talk to you. It's over. 11 MS. JACOBS: And all they had to say -- I've 12 got to take the flip side -- is -- and because it's their 13 house, because if they don't want to create the 14 ambiguity, they are the ones that have to say: Will 15 you talk to us now? 16 They don't even have to ask him to sign the 17 waiver, although I think the waiver is proof positive. 18 Once he signs the waiver, you know, I haven't got much 19 to argue in terms of the admissibility of the 20 confession. But if they create the ambiguity, then 21 according to Miranda, that ambiguity is resolved against 22 them. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand 24 how they create the ambiguity. 25 MS. JACOBS: Because they are leaving --
49 Alderson Reporting Company

1 they're not moving off of square one. They're leaving 2 this, where they are not looking for an answer to 3 whether the rights want to be waived and they are 4 immediately, as they did in this case, going into 5 interview mode. They are going to start to question 6 him. 7 And this gets to Moseley, where, in fact, you 8 end up where you are badgering somebody, and in this case, 9 they used many different tactics: the softening technique -10 - here, have a mint. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess this 12 gets back to a question I had earlier. I thought 13 there was no dispute on this record that there was no 14 involuntariness. We are talking about a violation of 15 the technical, important but formal, Miranda 16 requirements. This is not a case where the person says: 17 My statements were involuntary. 18 MS. JACOBS: If you are going to base this 19 on an implied waiver, don't you have to look to see what 20 the circumstances were that were going on? How can you 21 look at the very end of a 2-hour and -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's correct -23 and that's where -- how I read Butler; you have to look at 24 the circumstances. And you're saying no, you don't look at 25 any circumstances; they have got to ask the question and

1 he has to waive. 2 MS. JACOBS: Yes. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The other 4 circumstances are irrelevant. 5 Well then, if yes, why are you talking to me 6 about 2 hours 15 minutes, what they are doing? You say 7 that circumstances don't matter. 8 MS. JACOBS: If you find that the officer 9 does not have to ask the question, does not have to 10 clarify whether in fact the defendant is remaining 11 silent, then I do have to talk to the rest to try and 12 persuade you that in those 2 hours and 45 minutes he was 13 not being cooperative, he was not willingly entering 14 into -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That issue is not in 16 this case, though. 17 MS. JACOBS: Well -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As I understand it, 19 you've lost at every stage on the voluntariness and have 20 not renewed that, correct? This is a Miranda case; it's 21 not a Fifth Amendment case. 22 MS. JACOBS: I did -- I did talk about 23 voluntariness in my brief to this Court. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your argument would be the 25 same if this was compressed to 45 minutes?

1 MS. JACOBS: Yes. 
 2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Same result? 
 3 MS. JACOBS: Yes. 
 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 30 minutes? 
 5 MS. JACOBS: Yes. 
 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 15? 
 7 MS. JACOBS: Yes. 
 8 (Laughter.) 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One? I mean, 10 that's -- I don't want to piggyback off 11 Justice Kennedy's point, but that's the whole point, is 12 you do not look at any of those circumstances, you say. 13 Before they can say anything more, they have to get a 14 waiver. So it's 30 seconds if they go on, before 15 they -- if they sit there for how long before -- how 16 long do they have to ask, do you want to waive? 17 MS. JACOBS: If -- if you were going to go 18 and use implied waiver, if -- and I think that you can use 19 an implied waiver, you -- you are interested in looking at 20 what happened in this case to decide whether, in fact, 21 the "yes" answers were an implied waiver. And that's why 22 I'm arguing about the circumstances, that there's 23 nothing in these circumstances that could lead you to 24 believe that after 2 hours and 45 minutes, there was a 25 voluntary waiver, the implied waiver.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could -- could you 2 describe a situation where you think there would be an 3 implied waiver? 4 MS. JACOBS: I'm willing to talk to you, but 5 I won't put anything in writing. I'll willing to listen 6 to what you have to say, but I'm not going to answer 7 your questions. And then your -- then as the 8 conversation -- a conversation ensues, and I think this 9 is what Justice Alito -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought 11 that -- that doesn't sound implied. That sounds 12 express to me. 13 MS. JACOBS: Okay. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, is -15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. Excuse me. A waiver 16 of what? I thought the Chief Justice was talking about 17 a waiver of your right to remain silent. 18 MS. JACOBS: Yes. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: That wasn't a waiver -20 MS. JACOBS: Okay. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- of his right to remain 22 silent. 23 MS. JACOBS: Then let me give another 24 example of a waiver of the right to remain silent. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm willing to talk to you,
53 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 I'm willing to listen to you. It seems to me you're 2 confusing a -- a waiver of -- of the right to remain 3 silent with a waiver of the right not to be 4 interrogated, which is the right that you are asserting 5 here, a right not to be interrogated, unless going 6 in you say, I waive my right to remain silent. That's -7 that's the new right that you are asserting. 8 MS. JACOBS: Well, it's not a new right. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: A right not to be 10 interrogated. 11 MS. JACOBS: It's -- it's not a new right. 12 It's not a new right. The police cannot interrogate the 13 defendant unless they read him his rights and my 14 understanding of Miranda is that they obtain a waiver of 15 those rights. 16 Without obtaining the waiver, questioning 17 cannot ensue, because then the rest of the questioning 18 becomes trying to talk the defendant into waiving the 19 rights, trying to talk the defendant into confessing, 20 and you have badgering and you have persistent 21 questioning, and you don't end up with a volitional 22 waiver or a volitional statement. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So what -24 what is an implied waiver case? 25 MS. JACOBS: Well, it's -- the implied
54 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 waiver case is North Carolina v. Butler. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's right. 3 Now, getting back to Ms. Saharsky's point, she said if you 4 prevail, you have to overrule Butler. And it seems to 5 me that that's the point we're at. 6 MS. JACOBS: But Butler -- I don't think you 7 have to overrule Butler, because Butler really was a 8 right to counsel case. It did talk about the right to 9 remain silent, but most of language has to do with the 10 fact that this gentleman did not waive the right to 11 counsel. 12 So, I don't think you have to. I think you 13 can still have implied waivers. 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, there's -15 so, there's no implied waiver with respect to the right 16 to remain silent? 17 MS. JACOBS: That's a hard question, and I 18 don't have -- I don't have an easy answer or a hard 19 answer for you. I -- I don't think that -- I don't 20 think that you want to hog-tie the police. I agree with 21 that. I think that the police should be able to talk to a 22 defendant, but there's got -- but it's got to be 23 voluntary, and that in order to do that, you really have 24 to get a waiver. 25 U.S. v. Cardwell I think is an implied
55 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 waiver where the defendant starts to talk to the officer 2 there -- they're in a police car, and the defendant 3 starts to talk to the officer after an hour and a half 4 of silence, although that, again, isn't a custodial 5 situation, but the police found -- but the court found 6 that that was, in fact, a waiver. 7 So if there are no further questions, I'll 8 cede my time. Thank you. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 10 Mr. Restuccia, you have 4 minutes remaining. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I have to say that -12 page 475 and 476, particularly, of Miranda do talk in 13 terms of a -- of a waiver. Did -- are there -- did the 14 subsequent cases indicate an articulation of that view 15 that's closer to your position? 16 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF B. ERIC RESTUCCIA 17 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 18 MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, I think Miranda itself 19 contemplates pre-waiver interrogation. If you look at 20 page 14 of the -- of the reply brief, the yellow brief, 21 and the quote from Miranda talking about the processes is, 22 on page 14, "Once warnings have been given, the 23 subsequent procedure is clear. If" -- it's on page -24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What page is -25 MR. RESTUCCIA: Page 14 on the left side in

1 the middle. It's a block quote from Miranda. This is 2 Miranda's description of the processes: "Once warnings 3 have been given, the subsequent procedure is clear. If 4 the individual indicates in any manner at any time prior 5 to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain 6 silent, the interrogation must cease." The -7 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why doesn't it -8 JUSTICE BREYER: But I don't think that was the 9 question. The question, at least as I understood it, is 10 that Miranda says you cannot admit a confession into 11 evidence unless he has first waived it. 12 MR. RESTUCCIA: That's right. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: Then it says, clearly, that 14 even if the police and the prosecution testify he did 15 waive it, even if they say he did, explicitly, still, if 16 there's a long questioning, even then, the court should 17 be very careful about admitting it. 18 MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. But then -19 JUSTICE BREYER: And doesn't it flow from 20 that a fortiori that if he doesn't admit it and all there 21 is, is the long questioning that, there has been no 22 waiver? 23 MR. RESTUCCIA: But here Mr. Thompkins 24 answered a series of questions knowing -25 JUSTICE BREYER: He answered three
57 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 questions. 2 MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. One, do you 4 believe in God? Yes. 5 Two, do you pray to God? Yes. 6 Three, have you asked God for forgiveness 7 for shooting the boy? Yes. 8 Okay. So, where -- where did he waive it? 9 MR. RESTUCCIA: He -- that's what the 10 Federal courts have done on direct review -- this is what 11 Cardwell did, and there are five or six circuits have 12 found the answers to the questions themselves can be the 13 best -14 JUSTICE BREYER: So, in this case, after 2 15 hours and 15 minutes when he gave the answers I just 16 said, when did he waive his Miranda rights? 17 MR. RESTUCCIA: When he answered those 18 questions, because the -19 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I think any then -- then 20 Miranda is -21 MR. RESTUCCIA: No, because -22 JUSTICE BREYER: It says you can't admit the stuff 23 after a long questioning unless he waives. Obviously, he says 24 something or there would be nothing to admit. 25 MR. RESTUCCIA: The -- that's what the
58 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Federal courts have done in applying Butler, because the 2 words and actions of the person interrogated can give 3 rise to the inference that the person has waived. Where 4 the person has taken action that's inconsistent with the 5 exercise of his rights, it is proper to find waiver. 6 The -- this -7 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, can you go back 8 to page 14 in your reply brief? "Once warnings have 9 been given, the subsequent procedure is clear. If the 10 individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to 11 or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, 12 the interrogation must cease." 13 MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. 14 JUSTICE STEVENS: So the question is whether 15 during those two hours by not answering a -- a number of 16 questions, did he indicate in any way that he wished to 17 remain silent? 18 MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. That this -- so if 19 you look at the implication analysis, did he make it clear 20 that I don't want to participate in this interrogation? 21 Detective Helgert's testimony -22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Then it says that any -- in 23 any manner that he wished to remain silent. And until 24 the 2 hours and a half later when he did answer the 25 three questions, that's pretty -- it's at least arguable
59 Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that his silence indicated he wished to remain silent. 2 MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, what happens, though, 3 in Davis, this Court made clear for the purpose of 4 invocation, that the invocation has to be unambiguous 5 because the police have to know when they have to cut 6 off their questioning. The -- so, if it's ambiguous, 7 it's ultimately, for the question of invocation, his 8 burden to assert the right to take an affirmative action 9 to show, I don't want to answer any questions. 10 Detective Helgert believed, through his 11 limited responses, the give and take of part of this 12 interview, that he was a willing participant in the 13 interview. This is the factual record that was 14 established by the State courts. It's important to 15 remember that this case being reviewed in habeas that 16 those factual determinations are entitled to deference 17 unless disproven. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 19 MR. RESTUCCIA: Thank you. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is 21 submitted. 22 (Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in the 23 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 24 25
