1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument first this morning in Case 09-338, 5 Renico v. Lett. 6 Mr. McGormley. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D. McGORMLEY 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. McGORMLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 10 it please the Court: 11 Because this is a habeas case arising from a 12 murder conviction obtained in the Michigan courts, the 13 threshold question under AEDPA is whether there is any 14 clearly established Supreme Court precedent that the 15 Michigan Supreme Court objectively, unreasonably applied 16 in rejecting Mr. Lett's claims that the trial court had 17 abused its discretion in -- in discharging the jury due 18 to deadlock. 19 The Sixth Circuit second-guessed on habeas, 20 ignored deference under AEDPA, as well as the broad 21 discretion, due the trial court determination. Here 22 there was a note suggesting acrimonious deliberations 23 received early on in the second day of deliberations, 24 followed by a second note suggesting a deadlock after 25 approximately 10 hours of trial testimony and 4 hours of
3 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 deliberations. 2 The trial court at that time engaged the 3 foreperson in a colloquy, a two-part colloquy, in which 4 the foreperson not only confirmed the content of the 5 first note, but also confirmed the existence of a 6 deadlock. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. The content 8 of the first note was a query of the court. And that 9 query was: "What happens if we can't reach a verdict?" 10 Isn't that substantially different? Doesn't that 11 suggest that the jury is trying to figure out what are 12 the consequences of its actions and whether reaching a 13 consensus is possible? 14 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, Justice Sotomayor, the 15 first note was the note regarding our raised voices 16 disturbing other proceedings. The second note 17 regards - 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. How long 19 before that last note was that? 20 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, the Michigan Supreme 21 Court refers to that as early on in the second day of 22 deliberations. And then there is approximately 3 hours 23 and 15 more minutes of deliberations, because after the 24 second note - 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did anybody hear the
4 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 voices? 2 MR. McGORMLEY: The record doesn't disclose, 3 doesn't disclose that. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what 5 facts found by the lower courts or the trial courts show 6 that the Court acted, quote, and this is from our 7 earlier Perez case, the very first in this area, 8 "deliberately, responsibly, and not precipitously" in 9 declaring a mistrial. What in the facts you have 10 recited - 11 MR. McGORMLEY: Well - 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- show that activity? 13 MR. McGORMLEY: Justice Sotomayor, the first 14 point I would make is that, of course, this is on habeas 15 review, and so the -- the Michigan Supreme Court made 16 factual findings here that would be due deference. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is the factual 18 finding that you think we have to give deference to? I 19 know the facts you've recited. There don't appear to be 20 any of the facts with respect to what occurred during 21 the activity. So what factual finding do we have to 22 give deference to? 23 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, the factual finding by 24 the Michigan Supreme Court that -- that there appeared 25 to be acrimonious deliberations. That's a factual
5 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 finding due deference under (e)(1). 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I'm not sure how 3 that finding supports the finding, or a finding, that 4 the Court was acting deliberately, responsibly, and not 5 precipitously. 6 MR. McGORMLEY: Going back to this Court's 7 opinion in Perez, considering sound judgment, 8 discretion, considering all the circumstances, here we 9 have to look at the totality of the circumstances in 10 that it was a relatively short trial, that we have a 11 note that could be reasonably interpreted as acrimonious 12 deliberations, the second note that could be reasonably 13 construed as a deadlock. 14 And then the trial court did not declare a 15 mistrial at that point. Rather, the trial court brings 16 the jury out and engages in a colloquy. And in that 17 colloquy, the trial court accepts the foreperson's 18 answer at her word. And that is: "Are you going to be 19 able to reach unanimous verdict?" The answer being: 20 "No." And in fact, it's the Sixth Circuit who 21 second-guessed in this case by saying: You can't place 22 that much weight on that statement by the foreperson. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because the foreperson at 24 first hesitated. When the court asked the question, 25 "Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not,"
6 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 then there's no response. And then the court says, "Yes 2 or no?" And only at that second point does the 3 foreperson say "no." So it was a reluctant "no." 4 MR. McGORMLEY: I don't necessarily believe 5 it was a reluctant no. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: She might have been 7 sneezing. I mean, we don't know what caused the pause, 8 do we? 9 MR. McGORMLEY: That's correct, 10 Justice Scalia. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's another factor 12 in this. We have the transcript. Are you urging that, 13 because the trial court judge was there on the spot, saw 14 the jury, worked with the jury, that that's something 15 that deserves a special measure of respect? 16 MR. McGORMLEY: Absolutely, 17 Justice Ginsburg. And this Court has qualified that as 18 broad discretion and special respect due the trial court 19 determination, after the trial court is the one viewing 20 the jury in real time. So absolutely. And in fact, 21 this -- this risk of coercion was recognized also by 22 this Court in Arizona v. Washington. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you another 24 question about what happened? 25 After the foreperson said: No, Judge, we
7 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 are not going to reach a unanimous verdict, the judge 2 says: All right, I hereby declare a mistrial; the jury 3 is dismissed. And then the next entry in the transcript 4 that we have is: Well, Mr. Gordon snuck away before we 5 could set a new trial date. Now, Mr. Gordon was defense 6 -- was the defense attorney? 7 MR. McGORMLEY: Correct, Your Honor. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: So when did he leave? Do we 9 know when he left? He was present when the judge said 10 that she was going to declare a mistrial? 11 MR. McGORMLEY: Correct. But I don't know 12 that minute or so gap. I don't know when Mr. Gordon 13 snuck out. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me, along the 15 line of -- the same line of questioning, I understand 16 about AEDPA. I understand about deference, the 17 jurisdictions. Just tell me a little bit about how this 18 often works in State courts and in Federal courts? 19 Would it be good practice, in your view - 20 and that may not control your case, but would it be good 21 practice for the -- a judge to have had exactly this 22 colloquy and then say: The jurors are dismissed while I 23 talk with counsel. And you say: Counsel, in light of 24 this response, I am prepared to declare a mistrial. Do 25 you have any comment?
8 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Is that good practice? 2 MR. McGORMLEY: It may be good practice, but 3 the question becomes whether it's constitutionally 4 required. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking -- I'm asking 6 if it's good practice as a general practice. 7 MR. McGORMLEY: I would say -- well, in this 8 Court - 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because -- because that 10 will bear, ultimately, on a constitutional issue. I 11 understand deference. I understand that all intendments 12 are in favor of what the State Supreme Court found. I'm 13 just -- I want you to tell me how it works out there in 14 the real world? 15 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, I believe that 16 discussion with counsel is a factor in -- in the 17 consideration. I don't dispute that. But this Court 18 has never held that it's a requirement. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if, in fact, there 20 isn't -- what if both Counsel say, no, you should not 21 declare a mistrial? Can the judge go ahead and declare 22 a mistrial? 23 MR. McGORMLEY: Absolutely. And here -- and 24 here's why. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not a very big fact.

1 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, it's important in the 2 coercion context, because certainly the trial court has 3 an independent obligation to ensure a just judgment. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That independent 5 obligation is not reinforced by getting counsel's views 6 just as a matter of good practice? 7 MR. McGORMLEY: It may be. It may be 8 reinforced in certain circumstances, but again, we are 9 looking at the totality of the circumstances when we 10 have a note indicating acrimony, a note indicating 11 deadlock, and then the colloquy in which there's an 12 unequivocal - 13 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, certainly it's good 14 practice. If both counsel agree that there is manifest 15 necessity for a mistrial, then there isn't going to be a 16 double jeopardy issue in the case, isn't that right? 17 MR. McGORMLEY: Correct. Under Dennis, if 18 the defendant consents, then there is no double 19 jeopardy. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was there an objection here 21 by counsel for the defendant? 22 MR. McGORMLEY: No. No, there wasn't. But, 23 you know, the colloquy is relatively short. But no, I 24 believe the defendant's counsel could have objected. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there was a ruling
10 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 by the court: I hereby declare a mistrial. I suppose 2 you could have an objection, but it would be very -- the 3 jury was present when the judge said: I hereby declare 4 the mistrial. 5 MR. McGORMLEY: Correct. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it would be rather 7 awkward for the counsel at that is point. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no -- there was 9 no pause, you agree, between the foreperson's report and 10 the court then said immediately afterward: The jury is 11 dismissed. So there was no interval for an objection? 12 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, it -- it would be 13 difficult for counsel to object at that point, but I 14 still think counsel could have made a record immediately 15 at that point. 16 JUSTICE ALITO: Why would it have been 17 difficult? Why would it be difficult for counsel to 18 say, may we have a sidebar, and say, Your Honor, I don't 19 think that there should be a mistrial, I think you 20 should ask the jury to deliberate further? 21 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, that is possible and 22 that as seen in the Webb case as well, where the trial 23 court -- this is a circuit court - 24 JUSTICE STEVENS: What do you make of the 25 fact that in subsequent proceedings the prosecutor
11 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 acknowledged that the judge made a mistake? 2 MR. McGORMLEY: In Michigan confessions of 3 error are controlled by court rule as a procedural 4 matter, and the appellate courts have the ability to 5 accept statements that could be qualified as a 6 confession of error or not. Here the Michigan Supreme 7 Court addressed this case on the merits, the underlying 8 double jeopardy merits. In much the same way, it did 9 not address potential waiver or consent issues by the 10 defendant. So we have a merits opinion here. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: There are thousands and 12 thousands of mistrials every year and hung juries are 13 not all that unusual. So in this case we have testimony 14 going on for 4 days, 10 hours total. And we have jury 15 deliberation of 4-1/2 hours, and we have really very 16 little -- I think you can argue it both ways that the 17 jury was deadlocked. There are some things for, some 18 against, only a couple. 19 And he doesn't consult with the lawyer, all 20 right. Now, in these thousands and thousands of cases 21 that must be there over the decades, you probably looked 22 through a few or at least talked to your fellow bar 23 members. How many have you found where you would say 24 that a mistrial was declared despite facts that are on 25 your side? In other words, there are going to be
12 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 millions of cases, not millions but thousands; many of 2 them will support the defense. Maybe many support you. 3 But I haven't seen any here that say they support you. 4 So how many do? And what do you want me to read to see 5 that this is not an extreme case that counts as an abuse 6 of the judge's discretion? How many did you find which 7 will prove to me this is not, this is closer to the 8 norm? 9 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, the difficult part in 10 answering Your Honor's question is that this Court has 11 indicated that there is no mechanical formula or test. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: Correct. That's why I am 13 asking the question. What they've said is, is it an 14 abuse of discretion? And they've also said the judge 15 has to be careful. Okay, so we have like an abuse of 16 discretion scale and this is pretty far over on the 17 abuse of discretion side. I think anyone would admit. 18 But what cases will show to me that it's on your side, 19 not quite an abuse of discretion? Or is this the most 20 extreme case in history? 21 MR. McGORMLEY: I don't believe it is, Your 22 Honor. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: I know you don't believe 24 it. All I want you to do is to give me some evidence, 25 like refer me to some other cases or explain to me how
13 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 you have come to that conclusion, not on the facts of 2 this case, but looking on the scale. 3 MR. McGORMLEY: I reach that conclusion by 4 looking at this Court's other language, for instance - 5 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't want you to look at 6 this Court. We don't have a case where we said what was 7 an abuse of discretion. I want you to tell me -- and 8 I've already said this twice, but I am judging from your 9 answer you found no case supporting it. You have found 10 no case in the history of the United States that was 11 more extreme than this - 12 MR. McGORMLEY: I have not - 13 JUSTICE BREYER: -- where they said it 14 wasn't an abuse of discretion. That's what I'm judging 15 from your answer. 16 MR. McGORMLEY: I have not found a case on 17 these facts with a note indicating acrimonious 18 deliberations, that is correct. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: There is no note 20 indicating. There are five, there are notes they sent 21 out, and at 9:30 in the morning they said: Judge, we 22 have a concern about our voice levels, disturbing. 23 That's what they said. Then they asked to see the 24 evidence and they said: Explain Count 2. 25 Then they said: Are we allowed to break?
14 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 And then they said: What if we can't agree? Mistrial, 2 retrial, what? And at 12:27, the same time, they said: 3 What about lunch? 4 Then he brought them out and he says to the 5 juror: All right, do you believe it's hopelessly 6 deadlocked? And the foreperson said: The majority of 7 us don't believe that. And he said: Don't say what 8 you're going to say. And then he doesn't have the 9 lawyer there. 10 Okay, that's fairly extreme. So that's why 11 I ask the question. 12 MR. McGORMLEY: But the reference there 13 about don't say what you're going to say is likely a 14 reference to don't give the breakdown of your verdict. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McGormley, is it your 16 burden to answer that question? Given AEDPA, is it up 17 to you to show that this case is within the mainstream 18 or is it up to the other side to show rather 19 conclusively that it is not in the mainstream? I 20 thought that's what AEDPA required. 21 MR. McGORMLEY: It is Petitioner's burden. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is Petitioner's burden 23 to show that there are cases like this, where I guess to 24 show that uniformly in cases like this, there is no 25 discharge of the jury. And I'm not aware that they have
15 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 carried that burden. But we will ask when they come up. 2 It is their burden, however. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly but I'm drawing 4 some conclusions from your silence. You haven't found a 5 case supporting it? 6 MR. McGORMLEY: I haven't found a case on 7 these facts, but that's consistent - 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have you found any case 9 where a judge has declared a mistrial without conferring 10 with counsel, where the declaration was upheld? 11 MR. McGORMLEY: Actually, there's one out of 12 the Sixth Circuit, Klein v. Leis, from this very 13 circuit, in which the individual -- it was not a 14 deadlocked jury case, but the individual had some sort 15 of stun or control belt on the defendant and he lifted 16 it up, and the trial court - 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well you can't read from 18 that one, because in that one it was -- the mistrial was 19 held, not because of a jury deadlock, but because of 20 improper prejudicial actions during the trial. 21 MR. McGORMLEY: But that's - 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those are different 23 questions. 24 MR. McGORMLEY: But it's still a manifest 25 necessity determination. In fact, this Court has
16 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 indicated that on the spectrum of reasons a deadlocked 2 jury warrants the least amount of appellate scrutiny. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- yes, but 4 that doesn't mean none. 5 What -- other than we have cases where 6 judges have declared mistrials because they are going on 7 vacation. Those are easy, okay? 8 But somewhere the word "abuse of discretion" 9 means that someone has discretion, but is improperly 10 exercising it. What facts would it take for you to 11 believe that that would have been the case? What do you 12 have to take out of this case to say, ah, that was - 13 that would have been an abuse of discretion? What 14 point? If he got the note and declared a mistrial, that 15 would be enough, right? Or would it? 16 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, to best answer Your 17 Honor's question, I would point out again that in 18 Arizona this Court mentioned that examples being of 19 abuse of discretion or actions that cannot be condoned 20 are when the trial court acts irrationally, 21 irresponsibly, or for pretextual reasons. And in our 22 yellow brief we cited several cases where I would say 23 the Court was correct to find an abuse of discretion - 24 the Starling case in which the jury is giving a contrary 25 indication. The jury in the Starling case indicated
17 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that, we are making progress and in fact can we have 15 2 more minutes; and the judge pulse them out and declares 3 a mistrial. 4 Your Honor's example then with the Gordy 5 case would be the imminent travel plans and docket 6 considerations. 7 We also have where the court acts sua 8 sponte, and that's where -- the Webb case, where the 9 trial court - 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't that this one, 11 meaning the jury doesn't say, we are deadlocked, 12 hopelessly deadlocked, we cannot reach a verdict. It 13 asks: What happens if we don't? And the foreperson 14 hasn't conferred with the jury to determine whether or 15 not as a group they believe they are hopelessly 16 deadlocked. Why isn't this precipitous action? 17 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, again, as I -- as I 18 mentioned, it's a reasonable view of the first note that 19 it is indicative of acrimony. It's a reasonable view of 20 the second note that it was indicative of a deadlock. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: But again, that's --that's 22 not your burden. We are operating here under a statute 23 which says: "In a proceeding instituted by an 24 application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in 25 custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a
18 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 determination of a factual issue made by a State court 2 shall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall 3 have the burden of rebutting the presumption of 4 correctness by clear and convincing evidence." 5 Now, what is the factual 6 determination that has been made here? I assume it's 7 the factual determination that the jury was deadlocked. 8 MR. McGORMLEY: That is correct. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that has to be rebutted 10 by clear and convincing evidence, correct? 11 MR. McGORMLEY: That's correct. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't you answer that 13 to those questions. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what is the status of 15 the -- the Allen charge in Michigan? Has Michigan taken 16 a position on whether that's a good thing, a permissible 17 thing for a trial court to do? 18 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, a -- Michigan has 19 adopted the ABA standard. Michigan has the Instruction 20 3.12. It's not what we would call the traditional Allen 21 dynamite charge because it's not asking the minority to 22 give credence to the majority's opinion. So there is a 23 deadlocked jury instruction in Michigan. It's not the 24 traditional Allen dynamite charge. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that wasn't
19 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 requested, either? 2 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, that was not -- that 3 was not done here. But again, I think it's reasonable, 4 understanding that this is a dual -- dual-layered 5 deference case, being a habeas case as well as the trial 6 court being -- having broad discretion to make this 7 determination, that when you have -- have the notes -- I 8 mean, it -- it may tell the -- the trial court may have 9 felt that giving an Allen charge when there's acrimony 10 may be telling those minority jurors that it doesn't 11 matter and that they may have to submit to the majority 12 opinion. 13 So I believe it was -- it was reasonable for 14 the Michigan Supreme Court here, applying AEDPA to -- to 15 conclude that the -- the trial court acted in 16 conformance with this - 17 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you as a matter 18 of Michigan practice, could the trial judge have 19 interrogated the other jurors beyond the foreman and 20 asked them what they thought about whether there was a 21 deadlock? 22 MR. McGORMLEY: I believe that is 23 permissible, though not constitutionally required. 24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any reason -- do 25 you suppose there is any reason why he didn't do that?

1 MR. McGORMLEY: I believe - 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: She. 3 MR. McGORMLEY: -- she, the trial judge - 4 JUSTICE STEVENS: He took the view of the 5 foreman, an answer to one question, and that was it; is 6 that right? 7 MR. McGORMLEY: The - 8 JUSTICE STEVENS: His conclusion that there 9 was a deadlock was based on one question and one answer 10 of one of the jurors, and that was the whole record 11 supporting his decision; is that right? 12 MR. McGORMLEY: Respectfully, no, Your 13 Honor. I believe it was based on the totality of the 14 circumstances, including the two previous notes and a 15 bifurcated question where - 16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what other 17 circumstance is relevant? The fact that they raised 18 their voices during deliberation, certainly that -- that 19 doesn't cut any ice either way, does it? 20 MR. McGORMLEY: Well -- oh, I believe it 21 does, because this Court has indicated in Arizona 22 that -- that acrimony is a concern. It's a 23 countervailing concern to balancing the interest of the 24 defendant having his case decided by a single tribunal 25 and fair and just judgments, as well as society having
21 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 one fair opportunity to vindicate its laws. So I think 2 it's very much an appropriate consideration. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McGormley, what 4 evidence was there to the effect that the jury was not 5 deadlocked? 6 MR. McGORMLEY: None. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is presumably what 8 the other side has to prove by clear and convincing 9 evidence, if -- if we accept the factual finding of the 10 State court. 11 MR. McGORMLEY: Correct. That's why it's 12 imperative to view this case in the habeas box that it 13 resides. And that is the Michigan Supreme Court made 14 reasonable factual determinations and did not 15 objectively unreasonably apply this Court's precedent. 16 And the fact that we may look at these notes and go one 17 way or the other means that the State wins. The State 18 should prevail, because it's a reasonable interpretation 19 of those notes. If one person may say, I don't know 20 that that really indicates deadlock and the Michigan 21 Supreme Court is looking at it and it's a reasonable 22 determination, then deference should apply and the State 23 should prevail. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McGormley, do we have 25 any indication how long this trial judge was on the
22 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 bench when this trial came up? 2 MR. McGORMLEY: How long in terms of serving 3 on the bench? 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 5 MR. McGORMLEY: My recollection is that this 6 was an experienced trial judge who then went to either 7 civil arena from recorder's court or retired. So I 8 believe this was an experienced trial. I don't have the 9 exact years. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Acrimony, I recognize we 11 have talked about it in Arizona, but it -- I mean, it 12 could be that the jurors had all agreed on the murder 13 count and they were just quarrelling over whether they 14 should add the firearms count, or the other way around. 15 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, it -- it -- it gets 16 back to that fundamental - 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In which case they would 18 be much closer than -- than your comment about acrimony 19 might indicate. 20 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, it gets back to the 21 fundamental principle that the trial court should be 22 able to take -- now, this is on the second, but the 23 initial layer of deference -- that the trial court 24 should be able to take the foreperson at her word when 25 she says that the jury is deadlocked, the jury is
23 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 deadlocked, especially -- especially in light of 2 these - 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You can't say, can you, 4 that every time the jury records that it can't reach a 5 verdict or it hasn't reached a unanimous verdict, that 6 that's a legal deadlock requiring a mistrial, can you? 7 MR. McGORMLEY: I do not assert that. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So obviously the word 9 "deadlock," and as I read the judge's questions, he 10 defined it merely as a disagreement as to the verdict. 11 And later he uses "hopelessly deadlocked," but changes 12 the question when he asks the foreperson to respond. 13 Isn't there a difference between hopelessly, 14 i.e., no further deliberations is likely to reach a 15 verdict, as opposed to you can't ever reach a verdict? 16 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, I guess I don't quite 17 see the difference, because if the jury is in -- I -- I 18 think hopelessly deadlocked is probably a higher 19 standard than -- than genuinely deadlocked. 20 JUSTICE ALITO: That isn't what the judge 21 said just before she got the response. She said: Are 22 you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not? 23 MR. McGORMLEY: Right. It's a bifurcated 24 question. 25 JUSTICE ALITO: And the foreperson said:

1 No, judge. 2 MR. McGORMLEY: It's a bifurcated question, 3 correct. I mean, the -- the first one was regarding 4 confirming the nature of their note, and then, even with 5 the interruption, there are -- twice the court 6 approaches this inability to reach a unanimous verdict. 7 So again, here, what is paramount is that 8 it's the Michigan Supreme Court did not objectively 9 unreasonably apply this Court's clearly established 10 precedent. There -- there is no case that flatly 11 controls this case, other than the Braun-Perez standard. 12 In fact, the Sixth Circuit here created its own 13 three-part test, as we've indicated in our brief, when 14 they said that there are three considerations that 15 determine. 16 So when you take that three-part test, which 17 is not this Court's holdings and test on habeas, as well 18 as the second-guessing of those predicate factual 19 determinations being, well, the jury probably didn't 20 have enough time to even review the witnesses, juries 21 often report themselves deadlocked, we can't give as 22 much weight to this foreperson's statement, it's 23 contrary to these dual layers of deference. 24 And if there are no further questions, may I 25 reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal?

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 2 Ms. -- Ms. McCowan. 3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARLA R. McCOWAN 4 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 5 MS. McCOWAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 6 please the Court: 7 Habeas relief was properly granted. I would 8 like to first answer Justice Ginsburg's somewhat easy 9 question for me. Judge Brown was sworn into service on 10 January 1st of 1991. At the time of this trial she had 11 been on the bench approximately 6-1/2 years. We are not 12 disputing her experience as a trial judge. 13 I do disagree with my friend's contention 14 that the Sixth Circuit articulated any specific test. 15 What the Sixth Circuit did was set forth some 16 considerations or some guidelines, including the first 17 of which, that the court heard the -- heard the opinions 18 of the parties. And that does go a long way, Justice 19 Kennedy, toward the idea that the judge is exercising 20 sound discretion. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what would 22 be gained from that? I -- the parties, one says - 23 let's say one says yes and the other says no. You ought 24 to grant a mistrial, you shouldn't. 25 MS. McCOWAN: Well, at the very least, it
26 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 evidences that the trial judge at least considered that 2 there were -- that there competing interests and -- and 3 debated whether to -- to dismiss the jury, which is an 4 extraordinarily drastic remedy. 5 And instead, our position is that there 6 really is no down side to talking with counsel. You 7 would be able to have the benefit of the parties' 8 arguments. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do people usually - 10 in your experience is there usually a clear breakdown 11 between prosecution and defense on a question like this? 12 My perhaps uninformed view is presumably the defense, if 13 they have got a deadlocked jury, they want that to 14 continue, because all they need is, you` know, one 15 holdout. 16 MS. McCOWAN: My -- my experience -- there 17 is a range of things that are going on. I'm sorry, I 18 can't -- I -- I think it just -- it just depends on a 19 variety of the circumstances. But yes, I think that the 20 case law generally presumes that the defendant does want 21 the first jury to deliberate to verdict. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. -- Ms. McCowan, you are 23 -- you are arguing the case as -- as though the -- the 24 only question for us is whether it was an abuse of 25 discretion by the district judge -- by the trial judge
27 Alderson Reporting Company

1 here. 2 That would certainly be the case if this is 3 coming up through the Federal system and we had a 4 Federal trial judge who had made this determination, but 5 it is not. It -- it is coming up from a State court and 6 Congress enacted a statute designed specifically to 7 reduce the interference of Federal courts with -- with 8 State justice. And that statute says specifically that 9 where there has been a factual finding by the State 10 court, it cannot be contradicted by -- by the Federal 11 courts unless it is refuted by clear and convincing 12 evidence. 13 Now, what clear and convincing evidence is 14 there here that there was not a deadlocked jury? 15 MS. McCOWAN: Well, first, I am not sure 16 that I understand -- I -- I disagree with the -- with 17 the premise that -- that there was a factual finding by 18 the trial court that the jury was in fact deadlocked. 19 The judge acquired or extracted the "no" answer and then 20 immediately declared a mistrial. The ruling that - 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what was the basis 22 for that declaration of mistrial? 23 MS. McCOWAN: Well, presumably on these 24 facts it would be that -- that -- her estimation that 25 the jury was deadlocked.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 2 MS. McCOWAN: But there is no actual 3 specific ruling. And instead, what we are focused here 4 on is the Michigan Supreme Court's determination that 5 there was manifest necessity, and in the absence of the 6 trial judge exercising sound discretion, there is no - 7 the reason for the - 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Michigan Supreme 9 Court's determination is simply a determination of the 10 same fact: There was a manifest necessity because the 11 jury was deadlocked. 12 MS. McCOWAN: Well, my - 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that factfinding is 14 implicit not -- not only in what the trial court did, 15 but also in the Michigan Supreme Court's decision. 16 MS. McCOWAN: My understanding of manifest 17 necessity is that that was a legal determination by the 18 Michigan Supreme Court, that there was -- according to 19 this Court's precedent, there was manifest necessity. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the jury is 21 hopelessly deadlocked, is there a situation where that 22 would not constitute manifest necessity? 23 MS. McCOWAN: Typically, a genuinely and 24 hopelessly deadlocked jury does constitute - 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it does get back
29 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 to the factual determination of deadlock, correct? 2 MS. McCOWAN: Generally, yes -- yes, I 3 believe so. But in - 4 JUSTICE ALITO: The Michigan Supreme Court 5 cited four factors in support of its decision: the 6 length of the deliberations in relation to the 7 complexity of the case, the heated discussions among the 8 jurors, the fact most importantly that the foreperson 9 said that the jury would not be able to reach a 10 unanimous verdict, and the fact that there was no 11 objection by defense counsel. 12 Is there any decision in this Court that 13 says that under -- that in a case in which those four 14 factors are present, that the trial judge may not grant 15 a mistrial? 16 MS. McCOWAN: No, there are no specific 17 requirements. 18 JUSTICE ALITO: And is there -- could you 19 give us a long list of -- of lower court cases holding 20 that in a case where those four factors are present, a 21 trial judge may not grant a mistrial? 22 MS. McCOWAN: Well, no. But the law does 23 still require that the judge exercise sound discretion 24 in -- in making a determination that there - 25 JUSTICE ALITO: The question is when those
30 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 four factors are present, why are they not sufficient to 2 establish that the judge was exercising sound 3 discretion? Unless there is a decision of this Court or 4 perhaps a huge body of lower court case law, saying 5 that, no, even when those four factors are present you 6 may not grant a mistrial, how do you justify the 7 conclusion that you are asking us to draw? 8 MS. McCOWAN: Well, I -- I under -- I think 9 I understand the question. I do -- I do recognize that 10 there are no specific requirements, and that in the 11 absence of that, that there is nothing specific that the 12 trial judge was required to do beyond the exercise of 13 sound discretion. And in this case the judge -- the 14 record does not support that the judge did exercise 15 sound discretion. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: So can -- what -- what 17 is -- looking at -- can you take the converse of the 18 question I asked your colleague on the other side, if 19 you can remember it? I'll -- do you see what I'm -- on 20 the scale. I mean, this is a fairly simple case. 21 MS. McCOWAN: Right. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: What is wonderful about 23 this case is there is no disagreement about the facts. 24 We could write them in under two pages, just quoting 25 exactly the notes and exactly what the colloquy was and
31 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 note that the lawyer wasn't there. So there we are. 2 Now, imagine that in front of you. You - 3 it's easier for you to look up the cases than it is for 4 him, because you want to find reversals, and all you 5 have to do is you look and you try to see when the State 6 courts, Federal courts have said there was not manifest 7 necessity. 8 So I have some time. I will read some 9 cases. Which ones do you want me to read? And I don't 10 need to read the standard. I have the standard. And I 11 don't have to worry about -- I agree with the quotation 12 of the statute; you have the burden. And the question 13 is we have a record of those two pages, and does it 14 clearly show that he abused his discretion when he said 15 there was manifest necessity? Now, I will read - 16 whatever cases you tell me to read, I will read. But I 17 want to find facts and I'm not sure you found some, 18 either. 19 MS. McCOWAN: That's correct, Your Honor. 20 I - 21 JUSTICE BREYER: How could it be that there 22 are no cases? I mean really, thousands and thousands of 23 mistrials? 24 MS. McCOWAN: Indeed, there - 25 JUSTICE BREYER: How can it be that there
32 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 are no cases? Are reversals very, very rare for 2 manifest necessity? 3 MS. McCOWAN: Well, I -- I -- I did 4 undertake tremendous research, as did my staff, and I 5 did not find -- I mean, a short answer is I did not find 6 anything that looks even remotely as bad as this. 7 Now - 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, that's good. Now, tell 9 me then what did you find? When you say "remotely as 10 bad," then you perhaps found some where contention was 11 rejected, or where contention -- what did you find? 12 What did you find by way of cases where they said on 13 facts as bad as this, or not quite as bad as this, there 14 was no manifest necessity? 15 MS. McCOWAN: Well, I guess the short answer 16 is that --- that there was nothing exactly on point. I 17 mean, there were -- there were cases where the judge 18 acted abruptly and hastily and then there were cases 19 where the judge did consider the -- the options of the 20 parties. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the -- so the 22 proposition that what happened here is an abuse of 23 discretion cannot be said to be clearly established, 24 right? 25 MS. McCOWAN: Well, I don't think that it
33 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 has to be established at -- at a granular level. This 2 Court does require still that the -- that the trial 3 judge exercise sound discretion in making the 4 determination that there was manifest necessity. And 5 the case law - 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have 7 anything like this case that says this would be an abuse 8 of discretion? 9 MS. McCOWAN: Well, I -- I do believe that 10 this case looks something like -- Jorn, which is a 11 plurality opinion from this Court, where the trial judge 12 acted without warning, acted sua sponte, no warnings to 13 the parties whatsoever, and immediately declared a 14 mistrial; was acting irrationality, irresponsibly - 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the fact that 16 it's a plurality opinion means that it was not clearly 17 established by the decisions of this Court. 18 MS. McCOWAN: But in Arizona v. Washington 19 this Court quoted Jorn for the proposition that when the 20 trial judge acts irrationally and irresponsibly and 21 precipitously, that their action -- that their ruling 22 will not be upheld; and instead, sound discretion 23 requires that the trial judge act carefully and 24 deliberately. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: But our -- but our cases
34 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 have required much -- much more than that, much more 2 than referring to a generalized standard that our 3 opinions have set forth. They have required proving 4 that the application of that standard in our opinions 5 comports with the provision of the statute that requires 6 you to show that the claim resulted in a decision that 7 was contrary to or involved in unreasonable application 8 of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by 9 the Supreme Court of the United States. 10 Now, our cases don't show that you can 11 simply come in and say, well, it's an abuse of 12 discretion standard, that was clearly established by the 13 Supreme Court of the United States, and therefore all I 14 have to show is that this is an abuse of discretion. I 15 don't think so. I think our cases show you have to show 16 that the standard as applied by our cases does not cover 17 your situation. And you don't have any cases like that. 18 MS. McCOWAN: Well, I do understand -- well, 19 I guess the best answer that I have for that is that, 20 why there are no cases, is maybe because -- I mean, I 21 don't know, but what I -- what I came up with or 22 theorized is that I think that for the most part trial 23 courts understand that this is a tremendous obligation 24 that they must exercise sound discretion. And for the 25 most part for 186 years this has pretty much worked.

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: That may be. That may well 2 be - 3 MS. McCOWAN: And there's nothing - 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- which says it's a 5 terrible statute, but there it is. It says it has to be 6 contrary to clearly established Federal law as 7 determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. 8 And you are saying, no, it's enough if it's established 9 by an unbroken line of lower court decisions. That's 10 not what the statute says. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your -- your 12 position was that everybody agrees on what the law is: 13 If there is a deadlock, a new trial is appropriate. So 14 there is no question about that statement of the law. 15 It's the fact question, was this a deadlock, and up 16 until now we have been talking about this, including 17 Justice Scalia, under the fact problem of AEDPA; that 18 is, have you shown by clear and convincing evidence. 19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, is it quite correct 20 to say the legal issue is whether there's a deadlock? 21 Isn't the legal issue whether there was a manifest 22 necessity to take the action? Isn't that the test? 23 MS. McCOWAN: Precisely, Your Honor. 24 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the argument is that 25 there was not a manifest necessity shown, even though
36 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 there was disagreement about whether there was a 2 deadlock, because all deadlocks are not exactly alike. 3 MS. McCOWAN: Precisely. 4 JUSTICE STEVENS: Some people think one - 5 there is one holdout, that means it's a deadlock. Some 6 people think it -- it might be more. I don't think the 7 test is deadlock. The test is manifest necessity. 8 MS. McCOWAN: I agree. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you 10 answered an earlier question that I asked -- maybe I'm 11 -- maybe it was something I asked your friend, although 12 I doubt it, since it would help him -- that the issue 13 did come down to the factual determination of deadlock, 14 because if there is deadlock then there is manifest 15 necessity. 16 MS. McCOWAN: I'm sorry. I though that, 17 when I answered that question, that you were asking if 18 typically, if the jury is genuinely deadlocked, does 19 that constitute an example of manifest necessity? I'm 20 sorry for the - 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. So the case 22 comes down to whether or not this is a case of genuine 23 deadlock, right? 24 MS. McCOWAN: Well, no, I believe that the 25 case ultimately comes down to -- I am sorry if I
37 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 misspoke before. I believe that the case ultimately 2 comes down to whether the Michigan Supreme Court 3 unreasonably applied this Court's precedent in finding 4 that the trial judge exercised -- that there was 5 manifest necessity in the absence of the trial judge 6 exercising sound discretion. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With the layers - 8 with the two layers of deference worked into your 9 formulation. It's not simply whether the trial court 10 erred in the determination that there was a deadlock 11 that constitutes manifest necessity; it's whether or not 12 there was an abuse of -- of discretion for the trial 13 judge to so determine that we review under an additional 14 abuse of discretion standard. 15 MS. McCOWAN: Well, my understanding of 2254 16 is that it does take into consideration the contours of 17 the underlying constitutional violation, and it still is 18 our position that if the -- if the trial judge was not 19 exercising sound discretion, that it -- that it can't be 20 objectively unreasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court 21 to have found that, that that is necessarily 22 contemplated by 2254. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't our law 24 clearly establish the fact that the prosecution bears 25 the burden of showing there's manifest necessity, and if
38 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 there is an absence of evidence supporting that burden, 2 hasn't been -- hasn't been -- why isn't that the answer 3 to the case? 4 MS. McCOWAN: Well, that certainly sounds 5 fair. I don't want to quibble, but I think that the - 6 my understanding of the law is that when -- when there 7 is an objection by the defense, then the burden is on 8 the prosecution. In this case, there was no opportunity 9 to object. So I'm not sure that - 10 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why is that -- why is 11 that so? If Mr. Gordon thought that this jury was 12 11-to-1 for acquittal, do you think he would have been 13 reluctant to ask for a sidebar and object to the 14 granting of a mistrial? 15 MS. McCOWAN: I think, yes, practically - 16 practically speaking, I think he probably would have 17 been reluctant to jump up and -- I mean, this is a 18 Friday afternoon and the judge has essentially released 19 them for the day. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What does he have to lose 21 at that point? She has made the ruling and that's that 22 there is going to be a mistrial. The lawyer at that 23 point can say: Your Honor, I object, and moreover, I 24 would like you to give the Michigan version of the Allen 25 charge. Nothing stopped the lawyer from doing that.
39 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MS. McCOWAN: Well, I think just as a 2 practical matter, having the jury hear that the defense 3 does not want the jury to leave, the potential for 4 prejudice would be tremendous. And as a practical 5 matter, I think that the parties would have been 6 reluctant to do that. And I think - 7 JUSTICE ALITO: Are you really saying that? 8 You're saying that a lawyer in your office defending a 9 client who thinks that the jury is leaning, is 11-to-1 10 for acquittal, and the judge says, well, we're going to 11 have a mistrial and the acquittal is going out the 12 window, the lawyer is going to be reluctant to say: 13 Judge, may we have a sidebar, and then go to the sidebar 14 and object to the granting of a mistrial? 15 MS. McCOWAN: Well, I -- I'm not sure how we 16 -- we would know on these facts that the jury was 11-to 17 1 for acquittal. 18 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'm not suggesting 19 that they were or they weren't. I'm just asking about 20 what defense counsel would do in that situation. Maybe 21 they are more timid in Michigan than the ones I'm 22 familiar with. I would think that they would not be 23 hesitant to raise an objection if they thought it was 24 going to prejudice the client. 25 MS. McCOWAN: I certainly would hope so as
40 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 well. But here I think that it was all just done just 2 so fast and without warning and truly without any 3 opportunity to object. And so for that reason, I -- I 4 think that the lack of objection really doesn't do 5 anything to fortify the conclusion that there was 6 manifest necessity in these facts. Instead - 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what -- I'm 8 sorry. Please finish your sentence. 9 MS. McCOWAN: No. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. What other 11 explanation is there for a note saying "Are we being too 12 loud," other than that there was some degree of acrimony 13 on the jury? 14 MS. McCOWAN: Well, I don't think that the 15 Michigan Supreme Court even made a specific finding that 16 the jury had become -- had completely devolved at that 17 point and they were no longer -- I think that - 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, you don't 19 dispute the fact that a note came out saying, Are we 20 being too loud? 21 MS. McCOWAN: Not at all. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what would 23 that indicate other than that there was some degree of 24 acrimony? 25 MS. McCOWAN: I think it just also indicates
41 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 they maybe they just don't want anybody to hear them and 2 they want to make sure that they are not being 3 overheard, and that, you know, they have some privacy in 4 their deliberations and freedom to, you know, engage 5 in a -- in a free debate, as loud as they want to be. 6 I don't think that there is -- I mean, I 7 suppose what I'm trying to say, however inartfully, is 8 that I don't think we can do anything other than just 9 take that note at face value. They send out a note 10 saying: We have a concern that our voice levels may be 11 disturbing the other proceedings. That's it. It did 12 not - 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe that's right 14 and maybe it's wrong, but the State courts thought that 15 it was evidence of acrimony, which it could be. And you 16 say: Well, it also couldn't be. That may well be. But 17 we are bound to accept the factual determination of the 18 State court, unless you can show by clear and convincing 19 evidence that that's wrong. 20 MS. McCOWAN: I'm not sure -- I mean, maybe 21 I am just not understanding the Michigan Supreme Court 22 opinion, but I don't know that they actually made a 23 finding that that was, in fact, evidence of acrimony. 24 I thought that the Michigan Supreme Court 25 said that may indicate that they perhaps had become -
42 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that the deliberations had become acrimonious. And I - 2 and I think that that's a credible point. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't waste your time. I 4 will look for it. 5 MS. McCOWAN: I'm sorry. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't waste your argument 7 time. I will look for it. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there is no 9 case in our jurisprudence with identical or nearly 10 identical facts, so this is not under the "contrary to" 11 prong of 24 -- of 2254(d)(1). 12 So it has to be under the "unreasonable 13 application." Particularly for me, what Supreme Court 14 precedent do you think was unreasonably applied, and 15 explain how and why? 16 MS. McCOWAN: I think Arizona v. Washington 17 clearly establishes the law that the trial judge must 18 exercise sound discretion in finding a manifest 19 necessity. And in this case, on these facts, it was 20 objectively unreasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court 21 to have found that there was manifest necessity in the 22 absence of any discretion being exercised whatsoever by 23 the trial judge. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And in that case, one of 25 the specific factors was that he consulted with -- the
43 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 judge consulted with counsel before making the ruling? 2 MS. McCOWAN: In this case, that he -- that 3 the trial judge failed? 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in Arizona. 5 MS. McCOWAN: Oh, right. In -- right, 6 exactly. In Arizona v. Washington, what this Court had 7 found is that -- that the judge did exercise discretion; 8 that was -- that was evidenced by the judge giving the 9 parties an opportunity to weigh in on it. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a little shaky as 11 precedent for -- that -- that was a case that said: The 12 trial judge did right and no double jeopardy for a new 13 trial. But in passing, to get there, the Court said: 14 Well, this case didn't involve that. But the Court 15 isn't passing on anything other than the trial judge in 16 that case didn't violate defendant's right. 17 MS. McCOWAN: But I thought that this Court 18 did say that in any mistrial declaration, the trial 19 judge is obligated to still exercise sound discretion, 20 and a review in court must satisfy itself that, in 21 accordance with Perez, that the judge did in fact 22 exercise sound discretion in finding that there was 23 manifest necessity. 24 And I think that this case looks different 25 from Washington and may be similar to what was going on
44 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 in Jorn, where the judge acted without warning, without 2 any opportunity for the parties to weigh in on the 3 matter, and simply declared a mistrial, which this Court 4 found to be irrational, irresponsible, and precipitous. 5 And we - 6 JUSTICE ALITO: So are you suggesting that 7 whenever the trial judge abuses his or her discretion in 8 granting a mistrial, there can be relief under AEDPA? 9 It is clearly established that whenever there is an 10 abuse of discretion, relief can be granted under AEDPA. 11 It is an unreasonable application of our precedent? 12 MS. McCOWAN: I'm sorry. Just to clarify. 13 You are saying if the trial judge abused -- in fact 14 abuses his discretion? 15 JUSTICE ALITO: Right. 16 MS. McCOWAN: Yes. I think that if the 17 Michigan -- on these facts, for the Michigan Supreme 18 Court to have found that there -- that there was 19 manifest necessity in the absence of the judge 20 exercising any discretion whatsoever, that that was in 21 fact, an unreasonable application of this Court's 22 precedent. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the standard of review 24 for setting aside a determination of the State Supreme 25 Court is exactly the same as the standard of review for
45 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 reviewing a Federal district court and a Federal court 2 of appeals despite AEDPA? We simply look and see 3 whether there has been an abuse of discretion. If there 4 has, we set aside the State Supreme Court judgment? 5 MS. McCOWAN: No, I'm sorry. To clarify, it 6 still has to be whether -- we are looking at the 7 Michigan Supreme Court's decision here. We are in -- on 8 habeas, you are looking at the last reasoned State 9 court's opinion. 10 And if the State supreme court -- the last 11 reasoned court opinion says -- makes an objectively 12 unreasonable determination, under this Court's clearly 13 established precedent then relief will be warranted. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's objectively 15 unreasonable, you say, whenever there has been an abuse 16 of discretion by the -- by the trial court, right? 17 MS. McCOWAN: Well, if the trial judge does 18 not exercise any discretion whatsoever and acts 19 irrationally, irresponsibly, and precipitously, I 20 believe that relief would be warranted, even under 21 habeas review. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's not just abuse of 23 discretion; it's abuse of discretion plus something 24 else? Plus what? 25 MS. McCOWAN: Well, it's -- it's whether the
46 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Michigan -- whether the -- the decision under review, 2 whether it was an objectively unreasonable determination 3 of this Court's precedent. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you -- you do 5 agree that there could be situations where a Federal 6 court on direct review would find abuse of discretion, 7 and yet a court on habeas under AEDPA would say that 8 that has to stand? 9 MS. McCOWAN: Yes. And I want to clarify. 10 I think my understanding is that it's not just whether 11 this Court disagrees. It does still has to be an 12 objectively unreasonable determination. So it's not 13 just simply whether -- whether this Court or any habeas 14 court reviewing it would come to a different conclusion. 15 It still has to be objectively unreasonable. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there are a 17 category of cases where a Federal court could look at it 18 and say, that's an abuse of discretion, but that same 19 court reviewing it under habeas would say you are not 20 entitled to relief under AEDPA? 21 MS. McCOWAN: I think that that is right. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: But "objectively 23 unreasonable" is already built into the criterion of 24 abuse of discretion. You don't abuse your discretion if 25 what you have done is reasonable, you know, within the

1 ballpark. It seems to me you are doubling up here. 2 I -- I don't -- I don't understand how it works. 3 MS. McCOWAN: Well, our argument is that the 4 trial court was not in the ballpark here. The trial 5 court in this case did not exercise any discretion 6 whatsoever, let alone sound discretion. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can you say 8 that? I mean, you may think the discretion was abused, 9 but it's not like he just suddenly announced there was 10 going to be a mistrial. He exercised discretion. He 11 looked at the note, he asked the question, he's -- are 12 you hopelessly deadlocked? Are you going to be able to 13 reach a unanimous verdict? 14 And he was able to rely on the fact that 15 they had previously sent out a note saying, are we being 16 too loud, and the fact he knew, 4-1/2 hours on a case in 17 which there were 10 hours of testimony. 18 I mean, I understand your argument that he 19 abused his discretion, but I don't understand the 20 argument that he didn't exercise discretion at all. 21 MS. McCOWAN: Well, my -- my argument is 22 that the judge was not exercising sound discretion 23 because she was not responsibly gathering the facts. 24 She reached the conclusion that the jury was genuinely 25 deadlocked before she even asked a single question. She

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 got a -- a note from the jury - 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, she asked the 3 foreperson a question. 4 MS. McCOWAN: But if I could just back up a 5 couple lines, she received the note saying: What if we 6 can't agree. And she said: I have to conclude from 7 that, that that is your situation at this time. 8 So she had already reached the conclusion 9 that they were deadlocked before even asking a single 10 question. And then from there she -- she misdefines, 11 for lack of a better description -- she conflated mere 12 disagreement with deadlock, never corrected that - 13 that -- that erroneous definition. And she corralled 14 the -- the foreperson in a matter of seconds - 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where did -- where 16 did -- I'm sorry. Where did she conflate the two things 17 you said she conflated, deadlocked and the other thing? 18 What was it, inability to - 19 MS. McCOWAN: I'm in the petition appendix 20 at page 94a, where she says -- I'm sorry; at the bottom 21 of 93a. She said: "I need to ask if the jury is 22 deadlocked? In other words, is there a disagreement as 23 to the verdict?" 24 Disagreement is not - 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you got to
49 Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 read down further. She says: "Are you going to reach a 2 unanimous verdict or not?" And the foreperson says 3 "No." 4 MS. McCOWAN: But in the absence of an 5 expression of deadlock from the entire jury, on these 6 facts in this case, it was unreasonable for the Michigan 7 Supreme Court to find that that satisfied the trial 8 judge's obligation to exercise sound discretion. At a 9 minimum, the trial judge is required to responsively 10 gather the facts. 11 In this case, she -- she acted hastily and 12 precipitously and without regard for my client's right 13 to have this first jury deliberate to a verdict. She 14 declared a mistrial at the very first sign of 15 disagreement and did not give anybody an opportunity to 16 weigh in on that before she declared - 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just -- with 18 respect, it's not the very first sign of disagreement. 19 Reasonably interpreting, a note saying "Are we being too 20 loud" is a sign of disagreement. And there is another 21 note that comes out: "What happens if we can't agree?" 22 You are making it sound more precipitous than it was. 23 MS. McCOWAN: Well - 24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Also you are ignoring the 25 fact the first time the question was asked, do you

1 believe it was hopelessly deadlocked and the foreperson 2 said the majority of us don't believe that. And then 3 later - 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, no. I'm 5 sorry. 6 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- and there is a period, 7 in the opinion of the supreme court after we don't 8 believe that. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is not a 10 period on page 7 of the Petitioner's brief. Is that a 11 mistake? There's a - 12 MS. McCOWAN: I thought there was a dash. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- dash. And -- and 14 could the court be concerned that the person was about 15 to say, and again with deference to the court, "The 16 majority -- majority of us don't believe that" -- that 17 the defendant is guilty, that the defendant is innocent. 18 Wasn't the judge quite correct to stop her right there? 19 MS. McCOWAN: Well, it may be correct to 20 stop her right there, but there is other ways to figure 21 out exactly what the foreperson was trying to explain. 22 And if she was trying to say, well, the majority of us 23 think we can keep going, then it was -- it was incumbent 24 upon the trial judge to -- to do more. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that exactly

1 what she did? After that he says don't tell me what you 2 are going to -- or don't tell me what you are going to 3 say. I don't want to know what your verdict might be or 4 how the split is or anything like that, are you going to 5 reach a unanimous verdict? She did go on after that - 6 JUSTICE STEVENS: The foreperson did not 7 immediately answer. She had to ask a second question, 8 yes or no. And the foreperson answered for herself but 9 not necessarily for the jury when she said no. 10 MS. McCOWAN: I think that's right. And I 11 think - 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- how do you 13 know she answered for herself? The judge was talking - 14 she can't reach a unanimous verdict by herself. She is 15 answering for the jury. 16 MS. McCOWAN: I -- I think that really at 17 best, though -- given the circumstances of this case, at 18 best that was an expression of the foreperson's opinion, 19 that the jury would not likely be able -- but that is 20 not a statement. 21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you always have to poll 22 the jury, is that what you are saying is a requirement? 23 MS. McCOWAN: No, it's not -- it's not - 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I am not aware that you 25 would always have to poll the jury, and I could see some

1 real disadvantages to it as a matter of fact. It 2 perhaps puts more pressure on those who are the -- the 3 holdouts, it identifies, in some cases, whose are the 4 holdouts. I'm not aware that that's a requirement. 5 MS. McCOWAN: It's certainly not a 6 requirement and we were not saying that it is a 7 requirement. But on these facts when the jury has 8 simply sent the foreperson out to gather more 9 information, the trial judge was required to, in some 10 way, either -- either assure itself that the -- that the 11 jury as a whole did agree with the foreperson's 12 expression - 13 JUSTICE ALITO: You don't think it's a fair 14 inference from the note that the jury was stuck? Do you 15 think it's -- it's likely that they were just curious 16 and they were rolling along just fine, but they were 17 just curious, well, what if it happens after we 18 deliberated a little more if we can't reach a -- a 19 verdict? We just have a curiosity about that? Do you 20 think that's a fair inference from that note? 21 MS. McCOWAN: I think all that is fair is 22 that they were just trying to gather more information. 23 And that they -- but there is no - 24 JUSTICE ALITO: You don't think there's 25 an -- you can draw an inference fairly that they were -

1 Hernandez-Guardado and Lindsay v. Smith, two cases in 2 which -- circuit cases, granted, but two cases in which 3 involved jury deadlocks and counsel was not asked a 4 question. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: And those are the ones - 6 so as I'm seeing this case, it isn't that complicated. 7 You know, it's pretty clear what the standard is. The 8 standard is, was the decision of the -- of the State 9 court reasonable in deciding that there was a sound - 10 sound -- the words come from nine wheat, that's - 11 that's, you know, like 100 years ago or something. 12 MR. McGORMLEY: 186. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: 186 years ago when it was 14 something like "sound, careful, exercise patience" -- or 15 whatever, "the sound, careful exercise of discretion." 16 They said there was. And the question for us is, was 17 that reasonable? Okay? I guess if the judge had said, 18 "Hey, we have only been deliberating half an hour and 19 the game starts in five minutes, I've got to get 20 there -- dismissed," that would be unreasonable. 21 (Laughter.) 22 JUSTICE BREYER: Objectively unreasonable. 23 So come as close as you can to that, where they held 24 reasonable, and what case is it? 25 MR. McGORMLEY: Well -

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McGormley, you have 2 stressed throughout that it's not -- not the question 3 that Justice Breyer put, but there are two -- you have 4 emphasized the two screens. This comes to us after we 5 have the trial court ruling and the Michigan Supreme 6 Court ruling. So the case isn't all that easy, without 7 making the judgment as though it were coming up in the 8 Federal system. 9 MR. McGORMLEY: Correct, Justice Ginsburg, 10 this is not a very easy - 11 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, do you 12 think the most relevant precedent from this Court - 13 would you agree that the most relevant precedent from 14 this Court is Arizona v. Washington? 15 MR. McGORMLEY: I would not. And I - 16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why not? 17 MR. McGORMLEY: The reason why, Justice 18 Stevens, is because Arizona was not even a deadlocked 19 jury case. And there is language that helps flesh out 20 what an abuse of discretion would be. 21 JUSTICE STEVENS: What do you think the most 22 relevant precedent from this Court is? 23 MR. McGORMLEY: Perez. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have an 25 answer to Justice Breyer's question? It was sometime

1 ago, but - 2 (Laughter. ) 3 MR. McGORMLEY: My best answer, Justice 4 Breyer, is that the best cases I have are -- are 5 those -- are those two, because this -- this Court has 6 never overruled a manifest necessity determination due 7 to a deadlocked jury. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you suggesting that 9 you need a precedent overruling a lower court decision 10 before we could declare that something was 11 unreasonable -- that our precedent was unreasonably 12 applied? 13 MR. McGORMLEY: No, my point is that -- is 14 in the 186 years since Perez it's never happened. It 15 does not happen. And that is consistent with the broad 16 discretion and special respect - 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that could also be 18 consistent with the fact that Perez was clear enough 19 that judges have to act slowly and --and with thought, 20 and that lower courts are catching those when they are 21 not. I mean, I don't know how it cuts, is what I'm 22 saying. 23 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, I -- I think it is 24 indicative of the fact that this has never happened - 25 this has never happened before.
