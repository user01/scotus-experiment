  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, the Fiallo case concerns the situation of some individuals who are citizens applying for special immigration preferences for children of those citizens or relatives of those citizens.  The Court here ruled that that was covered by the plenary power.  Here the issue concerns only citizens applying for trying to transmit citizenship at birth, benefits to -- to parents, and so the difference is the question of what the extent of plenary power is.  And we believe that plenary power should stop, at the very least, before it reaches a situation where a citizen, here Mr. Boulais, is seeking to transmit citizenship benefits to a child who, as the sorts of situations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, wait.  Why is there no problem with transfer of allegiances?  I mean, it's fine to make it retroactive as far as the law is concerned, but that doesn't change the reality of it. The reality of it is he's not an American citizen until these conditions are -- are met, and he's proclaimed to be such.  Prior to that he's not an American citizen, is he?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "As soon as those conditions are met, then his citizenship is recognized at the time of birth. That's recognized under statute --"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But he was a citizen of some other country before then."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "And once his citizenship is recognized, he will be deemed to have been a dual citizen of the country from the date of birth, but the statute in Fiallo were coming in as aliens who might never become citizens, they were not coming in as citizens?  They were coming in as preference, preference-eligible aliens, and now you're saying, the distinction that you're making, if I grasp it correctly, is these people, if you are correct, will never come in as aliens.  The application is that the citizenship should be recognized immediately.  That's the distinction you're making?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "No, but Miss Davis, you're not suggesting that there's a constitutional right to have your citizenship conferred on an American, the child of an American parent brought abroad?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "Not at all, Your Honor.  What we're saying is the immigration statute makes a distinction between citizenship at birth and other forms of its basis, its rationale in the interest that the United States has with its relations with foreign powers.  And why is that inapplicable in -- in any case arising under this particular statute?"

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "And why -- to say that plenary power stops puzzles me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "Yes.  Justice Kennedy, this Court has never extended plenary power to every statute that potentially implicates foreign relations.  There's only -- there are many, many that do that, including child support and environmental laws.  This Court has also never extended plenary power to every action under even the Immigration Nationality Act in INS versus Chadha, for example."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What's the rationale for extending That would wash out the plenary power of the federal government?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, then they would be in the same category as the citizens here.  They would have been citizens from birth."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That doesn't make any sense to me. If -- if -- if -- if you admit them without making them citizens from birth, you have plenary power, but if you do even the greater thing, admit them and make them citizens from birth, suddenly your plenary power disappears.  It seems to me, if anything, it ought to be the opposite."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, here what we base our argument on is the structure of the statute as well as the long history of jus sanguinis citizenship, and this Court's ruling in Rogers versus Bellei which also indicated that citizenship at birth was subject to citizen at birth at the time that citizenship is recognized."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Let's assume the statute was slightly different and the citizenship to be conferred did not recognize -- did not relate back to birth.  Would you then say that the statute with that one change in it exceeded Congress' plenary power under the naturalization clause?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I guess I'm --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Maybe it would be simpler if I asked the -- I think I can ask the question a different way.  Do you think that the -- the -- the act of recognizing citizenship here for children born abroad is naturalization within the meaning of the naturalization clause?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "Yes, Your Honor, it is naturalization within the meaning of the constitutional equal protection.  Congress can do this if it simply did not have the relation back provision?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "That's -- that's correct."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I mean, we certainly wouldn't be able to argue that the transfer of allegiances and those issues no longer implicated foreign relations, and that's a critical part of our argument here. Let me turn --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I wonder, suppose there were no naturalization clause, suppose it didn't exist.  Wouldn't Congress still have the power to enact this statute?  No one is being naturalized. They are simply stating who is a citizen.  Just as, after all, no one in 1789 had been born in the United States of America or very few, and there had to be rules as to who was a citizen and who isn't -- hasn't had to confront that issue."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "If Congress said everyone in 1780 who has been born in the United States is a citizen of the United States, would that have been naturalizing everybody?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I think it would depend upon what the term naturalization meant even at that time. We know what it means now because Congress itself has defined it in the statute to apply only to those individuals who have citizenship that is prospective only, and here Mr. Boulais and his son come forward with a claim for citizenship that relates back to birth, so it's clearly not in the same category as naturalization is defined under the current statute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But it is -- it is naturalization in the broader sense of referring to the constitutional However, as we indicate in our brief, there are reasons to reassess Fiallo, given, in particular, the subsequent development of equal protection law that might suggest that the result in that case is one that the Court would no longer --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But if you were to reexamine Fiallo, I suppose under your view, the amendment in 1986 to the statute involved in Fiallo that adopted the position of the dissenters in Fiallo would also be unconstitutional because it basically followed the same pattern as this statute does."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor, yes, because it retains the sex-based classifications.  Of course, there the Congress was not responding to a finding on constitutionality, so they weren't bound by that kind of a ruling."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, we don't quarrel with the construction that Rogers versus Bellei adopted, which is that citizenship at birth is a form of naturalization. However what we argue is that the Congress in implementing that power has made a distinction between naturalization under the statute and citizenship at birth under the statute, and the implications of that distinction are that the plenary power of Congress to regulate immigration does not extend to citizenship at birth because citizenship at birth relates back to the date of birth because naturalization is defined to be prospective only because there isn't a requirement of an oath of allegiance in order to have citizenship at birth acknowledged."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Can such a person be denaturalized?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Miss Davis, I gather your position would be different if in addition to the three conditions that you mentioned there were a fourth condition, and that is that the child of the American father swear allegiance to the United States."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "If the child of the American?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Yes, yes.  Before he could retroactively be deemed a United States citizen from birth, in addition to the other three factors, he must swear allegiance to the United States."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, no, our argument would not be different.  I'm raising that because it's an indication of the fact that Congress --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, I thought your argument hinged to have been a citizen from birth, somehow the power of Congress to make people who are not born in this country and therefore automatically citizens, citizens somehow becomes abridged.  I don't -- I just don't see how the retroactivity -- it's such an artificial device.  Congress could make it retroactive or not retroactive."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I believe that the argument that I'm making reflects the construction of the statute.  The statute itself makes a distinction between citizenship and citizenship at birth and naturalization. It lists in the section 1401 jus soli citizenship along with citizenship at birth."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I understand that, but we're not talking about the statute.  I can agree that you can -- you can make a statutory distinction between those two situations, but does that convert into a constitutional immigration area, and we believe that --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "That -- that's correct, Your Honor. Applying it to citizens and citizens at birth, would extend the plenary power doctrine beyond where it has ever been extended in the -- in the past."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, that assumes the person is not an alien simply because Congress says the person shall be retroactively deemed a citizen.  But for constitutional purposes, it seems to me, as opposed to statutory purposes, whether the person is an alien or not should depend upon whether the person is a natural born citizen of the United States or whether citizenship must be"
  },

    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "President, correct, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "But someone -- someone born abroad is not in the same class as someone born jus solus here in the United States, which they are citizens by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, are they not?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor. However, the statute, the immigration and naturalization statute, treats those jus soli citizenship -- citizens and citizens at birth in the same section, so they clearly are contemplating that many of the same protections are going to apply to those citizens."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "May I just clarify one thing? Your view is the statute is invalid on its face, which, as I take it, means that the requirements as to the children of female parents have to be applied in the same way to children of male American citizen parents born abroad? applied to children of mother -- of mother -- whose mother was an American citizen."

It's whether he has -- he has already done it, merely by virtue of being a citizen and by having lived in the United States for a certain period of time. alternative to say not simply that the father is pushed into the same favorable position as the mother, but the mother is pushed into the same unfavorable position as the father."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, that would remedy the equal protection issue, but we believe that it would run contrary to what we know about the Court's principles in crafting a remedy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Has the Court ever in those extension versus invalidation cases, has it ever taken the route of lessening the benefits instead of equalizing up?  Has it ever equalized down instead of up?"

    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "We have not been able to find a case where there has been equalization down, as you say."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "In this case the government's as well, but would you comment on that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "Sure.  The issue is whether or not -- well, to start out, we believe that that issue is not properly in the case because we haven't challenged the physical presence requirements here, and the government as well as Congress have indicated that the way they have dealt with statelessness, concerns about statelessness is to have differential physical presence requirements for mothers and fathers.  Mr. Boulais doesn't have standing to challenge those.  He meets both those physical presence requirements.  If the remedy that we seek is imposed, those physical presence requirements will remain and will continue to do the job that the government says they are needed for in terms of addressing the potential for statelessness, but even beyond that, even assuming that it is in the case, the risk of statelessness is not gender are not in that classification, are there not?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "There are some nations that are not at that level.  There are some nations where there's a greater risk of statelessness for children of fathers, and those children are currently not getting the benefit of the generous physical presence requirements. For example, Canada has a provision that says that if a child is born abroad and doesn't maintain connections with Canada that they will lose their citizenship by age 28.  Well, by age 28, the child of a U.S. father, the father can no longer transmit the citizenship to the child, so in fact that child of U.S. father is at much greater risk of statelessness than a child of a U.S. mother who had a child with a Canadian citizen abroad. So the government could much better address its now engaged in an academic discussion?  Because in this case he has no standing to raise that problem since he amply meets the residence requirements, so he can't raise somebody else's case."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "Exactly right.  I mean, the remedy that we seek -- the Court would have to go beyond the four corners of the complaint or of the issue here, the case here in order to address the physical presence requirements."

    "speech": "Yes, I mean, their -- their citizenship is conferred by statute, and they are citizens from birth, and there are probably tens of millions of them, and George Romney was one of them, and I had not thought that they were naturalized citizens.  I thought they were citizens who were citizens by virtue of their birth, and they're citizens from birth, but you were saying they're the same as naturalized.  Or maybe I misunderstood."

  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "Yes.  Your Honor, the wording of the Constitution is natural born citizens for purposes of being President or Vice President.  And what -- I haven't done the research myself.  What commentators say is that natural born is the equivalent of -- includes, encompasses law; is that right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "DAVIS",
    "speech": "Your Honor, I guess the question is whether the term naturalized in the Constitution also encompasses natural born citizens. In Rogers versus Bellei suggested that it did."

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, maybe.  I'm just referring to the meaning of natural born within the Constitution.  I don't think you're disagreeing.  It requires jus soli, doesn't it?"

They can still come forward and in those unusual instances where they can establish that they meet that standard, apply classifications that would otherwise be suspect.  We believe those would be rare cases, but it's not that there is no review.  What it means is simply that you're saying, or that the citizens transmitting citizenship would be able to invoke the same constitutional standards as are usually invoked.

  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "That's not so.  I mean, you're right in saying by statute.  Normally in all countries citizenship was conferred by statute.  The Fourteenth Amendment was passed to the problem of slavery.  But citizenship on someone born abroad to a United States citizen is encompassed in the naturalization clause, and the important thing about Wong Kim Ark is the Court distinguished persons born to U.S. citizens abroad not on the ground that that was a more fundamental form of citizenship, but if anything, a less fundamental form of citizenship."

Bellei, which had to do with the constitutionality of a condition subsequent for a citizen, a person who was born abroad to v. Bellei, and importantly, it did so by distinguishing the children of U.S. parents born abroad from those who are born in the United States with the suggestion that Congress has greater latitude with respect to the naturalization of those persons than it does to others, precisely because they are not encompassed by the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment refers to citizens who are born or naturalized in the United States, and the Court pointed out that persons who are born to United States citizens abroad do not fall within that description and therefore are not citizens for Fourteenth Amendment purposes."

And also first of all a reason why Fiallo applies is it's a question of who is going to enter our society.  Certainly the children or parents in Fiallo were seeking to come into the United States with the hope eventually of being citizens.  In Fiallo it was a two-step task. Here it's a one-step, but we don't think that the analysis in Fiallo should change on that. And therefore deciding who should be a citizen is also an aspect of who is an alien.  They are flip side United States.

You would surely have a huge statelessness problem if you didn't recognize that the child born abroad to U.S. citizens is a U.S. citizen because, as you point out in most countries in the world, they go by blood, not by land of birth. So -- but you don't have that situation with -- an alien coming to our shores is a citizen of someplace. So the -- you call the child born abroad an alien, but in most places in the world that child would not be a citizen of the place in which that person is born; isn't that so?"

That's the way it used to be in the bad old days.  I take it from your argument if Congress wanted to go back to that, it would not offend anything in the U.S. Constitution to do so."

It is not a product of trying to discriminate.  It is a product of trying to put men or fathers in a position where they can do the same thing that mothers can do.  And let me explain why --"

I mean why do you have to have differential standards in the statute if that's all you want to do?  On your -- on the factual assumptions that you are making, which may well be true, it would be easier for the children of American mothers born abroad to satisfy the standard, but that doesn't seem to be an argument for his own right.  In this very case, petitioner Nguyen could have applied for citizenship in his own right after he became an adult and did not do so. The idea is that under these naturalization -- this naturalization provision, while one is still a child, one is under the care of the parent.  After adulthood, that's not so.  So what Congress was focusing on was not just biological paternity, but a recognized formal relationship that outside people could look at and say, yes, that is a father-child or mother-child relationship."

It is necessary that the formal legal relationship be you could be in a state where they have different relationships.

This Court pointed that out Lalli decision and pointed it out -- we quoted page 34 of our brief from this Court's decision in Lehr v. Robertson which we think is very instructive.  There the Court said the mother carries and bears the child.  In this sense her parental relationship is clear.  The validity of the father's parental claims must be gauged by other measures.  And again this is not just proof."

After our decision in Miller against Albright, In all of those situations, Congress moved to make things easier for U.S. citizen fathers to transmit citizenship.  From 1952 to 1986, only legitimization, which often meant marrying the mother, was adequate.  In 1986 Congress tried to ease things to make it easier for U.S. citizen fathers to put themselves in the same position as U.S. citizen mothers, by providing for the acknowledgment of the child in writing so that it would not be necessary to resort to the varying state laws regarding legitimization or elsewhere. The last point I would like to make with respect to -- two other points.  One, this is a transaction that occurred abroad, not in the United States.  It involved one alien and one U.S. citizen. This is not a situation in which the heightened scrutiny under our Constitution would ordinarily be thought to apply because of a solely about the legal relationship which he asserts is automatically established at the time of birth between a father and child.

In fact, the statute has progressively gotten more liberal, and I think that that underscores the fact that in -- as this Court looks at the intent of Congress in crafting a remedy that the Court should take into account, that Congress has progressively gotten more In addition, there are other indicia of Congress' intent.
