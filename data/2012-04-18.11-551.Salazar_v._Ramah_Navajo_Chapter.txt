1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:11 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 this morning in Case 11-551, Salazar, Secretary of the 5 Interior v. Ramah Navajo Chapter. 6 Mr. Freeman. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. FREEMAN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. FREEMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 The funding dispute in the -- in this case 12 is the result of two distinctive features of the ISDA's 13 statutory scheme. On the one hand, Congress has 14 required the Secretary of the Interior to accept every 15 self-determination contract proposed by an Indian tribe, 16 provided that the contract meets the requirements of the 17 Act, without regard to the total number of contracts 18 into which the Secretary must enter. 19 On the other hand, in every fiscal year 20 since 1994, Congress has enacted an explicit statutory 21 cap on the amount of money that the Secretary may use to 22 pay contract support costs under the ISDA and under 23 those contracts. 24 Now, we think under the circumstances, 25 Congress intended the Secretary to resolve these -- the

1 relationship between these provisions in exactly the way 2 that the Secretary has. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me, but could the 4 Secretary have done anything else? 5 MR. FREEMAN: I'm sorry. I couldn't hear 6 Your Honor. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could the Secretary have 8 done anything else? There's an allegation that the 9 Secretary in fact pays some contractors more than their 10 pro rata share, that it pays some nothing -11 MR. FREEMAN: Right. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- so that it's in 13 effect acting -- I don't want to use the word 14 "arbitrarily" -- but acting in whatever its best 15 interest is. So what protects the contracting party 16 from that -- from that conduct, assuming it were to be 17 correct? 18 MR. FREEMAN: Yes, Your Honor. Well, the 19 Secretary has promulgated a formal nationwide policy. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It says it has a policy. 21 MR. FREEMAN: Yes, and -22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the allegation is, 23 is that it's not following it, that it's choosing to pay 24 people some more than others. 25 MR. FREEMAN: Right. And let me address

1 that. The allegation is, I think, at page 9 to 10 of 2 Respondents' brief. Those allegations are, as a factual 3 matter, false. For example, they've given a couple of 4 examples where 0 percent contract support costs were 5 paid. One of those examples is a contract where it had 6 been entered into in that particular year. New 7 contracts are paid under a different appropriation. 8 Another example is they give a case of a tribe that was 9 paid 352 percent of its contract support costs. 10 And let me explain, I think it's 11 important to understand how -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you do that -13 MR. FREEMAN: Yes. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was my understanding 15 that that system that has been described as arbitrary 16 was not the one that was applicable to the years in 17 question. 18 MR. FREEMAN: That's right. At -- at the 19 time of the district court's ruling in this case, from 20 1994 to about 2006, the Secretary followed a uniform pro 21 rata distribution methodology according to the needs of 22 each of the individual tribes. Now, that's what we 23 thought the tribes wanted. We thought that was the 24 fairest way to do it. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All within the -- all
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 within the dollar amount that was specified by the 2 Congress in the "not to exceed" language. 3 MR. FREEMAN: That's exactly right, Your 4 Honor. Yes. So each tribe has an amount of need. This 5 is the amount that is estimated. It's a negotiated 6 figure between the Secretary and each tribe. And it is 7 undisputed that the amounts that Congress has been -8 has appropriated have never been enough to pay 100 9 percent of each of those figures for each member of the 10 Respondent class. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't we have similar 12 language in Cherokee Nation? Didn't we say that that 13 language in Cherokee Nation, which was in the general 14 appropriations statute, although not in each contract, 15 didn't mean that the Secretary could refuse to pay? 16 MR. FREEMAN: No, Your Honor. We did not 17 have similar language in Cherokee, if you mean the 18 Appropriations Act. It was under the same -19 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't mean the 20 Appropriations Act. I mean -- I mean the general 21 statute that governed this program. 22 MR. FREEMAN: No, that's right. And maybe 23 it would be helpful if I could -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: So why does it mean one 25 thing there and mean something else when -- in the
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Appropriations Act? 2 MR. FREEMAN: Well -- I may not be 3 understanding Your Honor's question, but I -- I think it 4 might be helpful if I explain what was at issue in 5 Cherokee. In Cherokee, the government was not in this 6 Court making Appropriations Clause arguments. We were 7 here making a very different argument. It was 8 undisputed in Cherokee that Congress had appropriated 9 enough money for the unobligated available funds, 10 lawfully available funds, for the Secretary to pay all 11 of the contracts that were at issue. 12 Our argument -- and to be sure, we thought 13 we were right -- our argument was that Congress had in 14 other provisions of the Act allowed us to set aside a 15 certain amount of money that, albeit lawfully available 16 to pay the contracts, we thought we could use to fund 17 the agency's inherent Federal operations. And the Court 18 said: No, no, no. These are contracts. The money was 19 lawfully available for you to pay, and there was no 20 statutory restriction against you paying it, so you had 21 to pay it. 22 And this case involves the circumstance 23 that -24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how -- what was 25 our reference in acceptance of the Ferris doctrine? And
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the Ferris doctrine was almost identical to this 2 situation, where Congress allotted a certain amount to 3 the building of a particular dam, and the same -- we 4 applied the Ferris principle and said even though they 5 gave it to one type of contract, the dam, they were 6 paying 1 percent less than others. 7 MR. FREEMAN: No -- no, Your Honor. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where they had an 9 allotment adequate enough to cover that individual. 10 MR. FREEMAN: No. I think that's not quite 11 an accurate characterization of Ferris. And it's 12 important to understand what Ferris -13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know what the Federal 14 Circuit said. I don't think the Federal Circuit's 15 right. If you read Ferris, that there was an 16 appropriation for the dam. 17 MR. FREEMAN: Ferris was an appropriation 18 for -- I think it was 40-some thousand dollars for 19 improvements to the Delaware River. And the government, 20 the Army Corps of Engineers, let out a contract for 21 $37,000 to dredge the river. Then after the contract 22 had been let out -- and this is critical. If you stop 23 the movie at the time the contract was issued, there was 24 sufficient funds to pay that contract. They were 25 lawfully available. We obligated them to the -- to the
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 contractor. 2 And then what happened in Ferris was, after 3 that lawful binding agreement was entered, agency 4 officials decided in their discretion that they'd prefer 5 not to spend the money on that, and they instead built a 6 wharf or something. 7 And what the Court said in Ferris -- and 8 this is -- we're not -- we have no quarrel with this 9 principle -- is that when the funds are lawfully 10 available and you obligate them to a contractor without 11 some contingency, then you can't just decide to spend it 12 on something else. That's a breach. And it's not a 13 defense to the breach that at the end of the -- that at 14 the end, once you've breached the contract, there isn't 15 enough money left in the appropriation to go back and 16 pay them what you should have. 17 That's different from this case, that there 18 is not enough lawfully available money to pay every 19 Respondent. 20 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but -- but there wasn't 21 in Ferris either. I mean, that was the problem. If the 22 appropriations had been enough to cover that plus the 23 later expenditures, there would have been no problem. 24 MR. FREEMAN: Your Honor, I think Ferris is 25 correctly understood -- particularly given this Court's
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 subsequent decisions in Sutton, in Bradley, Leiter, and 2 other cases, -- Ferris is correctly understood as 3 saying -- and this is the proposition, incidentally, for 4 which the Court cited Ferris in Cherokee. Ferris is 5 understood as saying if you've got a binding obligation 6 in which you promised to pay money that is lawfully 7 available, Congress gave it to you, then if you, agency 8 officials, do something in your executive discretion -9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Lawfully available subject 10 to appropriations. I mean, it was subject to 11 appropriations. 12 MR. FREEMAN: Well, in Ferris, there were -13 in fact, the contract was not made subject to 14 appropriations. And one of the things the Federal 15 Circuit pointed out was that the "subject to the 16 availability of appropriations" language that is now 17 ubiquitous in government contracts was developed in part 18 to make sure that the Ferris situation didn't later 19 arise. 20 But I want to underscore, if we know one 21 thing in this case, we know that Congress intended for 22 the Secretary not to pay any more than the amounts in 23 the statutory caps. 24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Freeman, could I try a 25 hypothetical on you? And it's -- it really is going to
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 this question of what Ferris means. So suppose that 2 there's a government program, and it's to purchase 3 airplanes. And it's -- the authorization language says 4 this is subject to appropriations, in the same way that 5 this language does. And the government, under this 6 program, enters into 10 contracts of a million dollars 7 each to buy 10 airplanes. But then it turns out that 8 Congress appropriates only $9 million, not $10 million. 9 So my question is: Now there are 10 10 contractors and -- but there's a shortfall of a million 11 dollars -12 MR. FREEMAN: Right. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- do those contractors have 14 contractual rights under Ferris? 15 MR. FREEMAN: I -- Your Honor, it's going to 16 depend on a couple of things. And let me -- let me 17 explain. I think, because by hypothesis in your 18 hypothetical we're entering into the contracts in 19 advance of appropriations, there is no right to be paid 20 until the appropriations are made. 21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. So the appropriation 22 has been made. It's a $9 million appropriation. 23 MR. FREEMAN: Right. And in that 24 circumstance, the agency cannot pay more than 25 $9 million, and there is no binding obligation,
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 contractual obligation, on the government to pay more. 2 Let me add something, though, in response -3 JUSTICE KAGAN: So -- so either one of these 4 airplane manufacturers is going to not have what he 5 contracted for, or all of them are not going to have 6 what they contracted for, because everybody is going 7 to -- their contract is going to be sliced. 8 MR. FREEMAN: And, Your Honor, the reason 9 why this is not a problem in real life is that there are 10 other provisions in your ordinary procurement contracts, 11 under the ordinary kind of contracts that this case is 12 not, that take care of that. 13 And the principal one is -14 JUSTICE KAGAN: My understanding, 15 Mr. Freeman, is that that is what Ferris said, was that 16 Ferris said in that situation where it turns out that 17 there's a shortfall but where there are contractual 18 commitments, that -- that the government is bound to 19 live up to those contractual commitments. And if 20 there's a shortfall, then it comes out of the Judgment 21 Fund. 22 MR. FREEMAN: No. Your Honor, it -- there 23 are a couple of things there. But let me first explain 24 why as a practical matter that doesn't happen in 25 circumstances that are -- are not like this scheme where
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 we're required to enter into every contract. In your 2 ordinary government procurement scheme, there are 3 termination for convenience provisions. 4 And, in fact, what happens in the 5 circumstances in which Your Honor posits is the 6 government terminates for convenience enough of the 7 contracts to make sure that we have the money to pay. 8 And if we didn't do that, it would be a violation of the 9 Antideficiency Act. And this Court has said many 10 times -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So do the tribes have 12 the right to stop providing the services -13 MR. FREEMAN: Yes. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that they've 15 contracted to? 16 MR. FREEMAN: Yes. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do they know that 18 until they know what they're getting? 19 MR. FREEMAN: Well -20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Meaning they don't know 21 what they're getting. 22 MR. FREEMAN: Well, they do know. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They signed a contract 24 that says you're going to pay them for their services to 25 their members and for their administrative costs. They
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 incur that cost, and then at the end of the year, the 2 government now says to them you've honored your part, 3 but we're not going to honor ours. 4 MR. FREEMAN: No -- no, Your Honor. 5 That's -- that's not correct, and let me explain why. 6 First, every contract that the -- every 7 member of the Respondent class signed in this case says 8 that the contractor's obligation to perform the services 9 that are at issue is subject to the availability of 10 appropriated funds. That's Section (1)(c)(iii) of the 11 model agreement that is read into every ISDA contract. 12 They further have the availability under 13 Section (1)(b)(v) of that model agreement to stop at any 14 point if they're worried that there's not going to be 15 enough money, and seek assurances from the Secretary 16 that there will be. 17 Now, as to whether they know and when they 18 know how much money they're going to get, that was the 19 point of the 2006 distribution policy that the Secretary 20 adopted. Under the pro rata system that we used for the 21 first many years, the tribes said, look, we don't know 22 how pro rata is going to work out. So, in consultation 23 with the tribes, and, indeed, with the aid of several of 24 the counsel for the Respondent class, we drafted a 25 policy that -

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What does the system do 2 to the 50-odd contracts that Arctic Slope, in its amici 3 brief, points to that are similar to these? Does this 4 now mean that moving forward, that every government 5 contractor who has a "subject to appropriations" 6 language takes the risk that at some point in the middle 7 of the contract, the government's going to dishonor its 8 obligation and pay it less than it said it would? 9 MR. FREEMAN: No. No, Your Honor. And this 10 is my -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do -- how do we 12 differentiate those 50 other contracts? 13 MR. FREEMAN: Well, I think they were citing 14 a number of different statutes in which the statutes 15 provide that funding is subject to the availability of 16 appropriations. 17 Now, it's important to underscore, that's 18 why I started with this point. I don't believe in any 19 of those statutory schemes is the government obligated 20 to enter into every contract that comes in the door. 21 And -22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but that's partly why 23 I asked you my hypothetical, Mr. Freeman, because I sort 24 of wanted to see whether you would distinguish the 25 hypothetical on that basis -
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. FREEMAN: Right. 2 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- but you didn't. You said 3 no, it really doesn't matter. Even if the government is 4 not obligated to enter into contracts, if the government 5 has entered into too many, too bad; we can't make those 6 additional appropriations. 7 MR. FREEMAN: And, Your Honor, it is -- the 8 unique features of this statutory scheme are absolutely 9 important, but I want to -- I took Your Honor's question 10 to be under the general appropriations principles that 11 we are describing, what would the result be? And I 12 think I'm right, but I should also add, as I said 13 before, there are very strict fiscal controls in 31 14 U.S.C. 1501, et sequitur, that make clear and prevent 15 the circumstance that Your Honor describes -16 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry, I'm not clear on 17 what this hypothetical is. I thought her 18 hypothetical -- Justice Kagan's -- was a situation where 19 the statute says, Mr. Secretary, you can spend no money 20 beyond what is appropriated. 21 MR. FREEMAN: Right. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: But the contract doesn't 23 mention it. That's Ferris. 24 I thought that the -- the real world is, in 25 contracting, you typically have both a statute that says
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 don't pay more than is appropriated -2 MR. FREEMAN: Right. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and in the contract, it 4 says, "subject to appropriation," putting the 5 contracting party on notice. 6 MR. FREEMAN: That's right. And -- and -7 JUSTICE BREYER: So which were you 8 answering? 9 MR. FREEMAN: I -- with respect to 10 Justice Kagan, I believe we had a colloquy in which I 11 said that because in her hypothetical we were entering 12 into the contracts in advance of appropriations, they 13 would have to be made express -- the contracts 14 themselves would have to be subject to the availability 15 of appropriations in the contracts. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: The words in the contract 17 are "subject to appropriations." 18 MR. FREEMAN: Yes. And without that, it 19 would be a violation of the Antideficiency Act -20 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 21 MR. FREEMAN: -- yes. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So in that world -23 now we get to the question -- in that world, what 24 happens when 15 people each enter into such a contract 25 for $100,000 each, and the appropriation turns out to be
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 too small to pay all of them, but big enough to pay 2 some? 3 MR. FREEMAN: Because, Your Honor, what I was 4 trying to answer is that, in your ordinary contractual 5 scheme, the government solves that problem in a very 6 straightforward way. We terminate for convenience the 7 contracts -- enough of those contracts to ensure that we 8 have no obligations beyond the available appropriations. 9 Now, we can't do that here, which is why 10 this is ultimately a question of congressional intent. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why don't we let 12 Congress fix it? There are so many ways that 13 Congress could fix this problem directly. By doing a 14 line item allocation, it could take away the obligation 15 to enter into these contracts and fully fund. It could 16 be much more direct -17 MR. FREEMAN: Your -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- than it's being, 19 given the interpretation that you're advancing. 20 MR. FREEMAN: Your Honor, I think it's 21 important to understand what -- and maybe it would help 22 if I took a minute to explain this -- what Congress was 23 trying to do in this statutory scheme. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It was trying -- it was 25 trying to tell the tribes, we're honoring our obligation
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 by paying you the costs, but we're really not going to 2 do it because we're going to let the government give you 3 less? 4 MR. FREEMAN: No. Look, Congress could -5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have to assume 6 Congress intends what it says. It intends to obligate 7 you to enter into contracts that -- that give -- make 8 you commit to paying their costs, correct? 9 MR. FREEMAN: Not with -- yes. But 10 450j-1(b) says, "notwithstanding any provision of this 11 Act, all funding under this Act is subject to the 12 availability of appropriations." 13 And let me explain why Congress would 14 have wanted to enact this statute that has some unusual 15 features. Congress, of course, could have said, we want 16 to give every tribe the opportunity to enter -- to 17 provide services in its own name to its own people, but 18 we're going to do this on a regular contract basis, 19 meaning we'll just give us -- some to the Secretary. 20 The Secretary signs contracts as they come in until he 21 doesn't have any money left. And then any tribe after 22 that who asks for a -- for a contract, the Secretary 23 says no, we don't have the money to do it. 24 But Congress chose a -- a different 25 approach. Congress wanted, as a matter of
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 self-determination, to require the Secretary to give 2 every tribe who wants the ability to do this the 3 opportunity to do it. But if it didn't then say all 4 funding is subject to the availability of 5 appropriations, the result would be that the government 6 would be exposed to a liability that Congress could not 7 estimate, because the ability of these tribes to pay for 8 overhead costs and whatever varies tremendously from 9 tribe -10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: To what extent do you -11 do you rely on -- you haven't mentioned it up until now, 12 but Congress, in these appropriations, said "not in 13 excess of." 14 MR. FREEMAN: Yes. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It wasn't just a general 16 "subject to appropriations." It was a specific amount, 17 the Secretary shall not pay in excess of a certain 18 dollar amount for these costs. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I had exactly the same 20 question. The "not to exceed" language, which I think 21 is the word, "not to exceed," hasn't been mentioned by 22 you yet because -- maybe you haven't had time. 23 MR. FREEMAN: Right. 24 (Laughter.) 25 MR. FREEMAN: That would be it.

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but I thought that 2 was what Judge Dyk said -3 MR. FREEMAN: Yes. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- was the critical -- the 5 difference between this and even the Cherokee case. 6 MR. FREEMAN: Right. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so my question is -8 is the same as Justice Ginsburg's. Isn't a principal 9 part of your argument that this contract said not to 10 exceed, and then the sums differ from year to year, but 11 let's say $95 million? 12 MR. FREEMAN: That -- that's exactly right, 13 Your Honor. 14 I mean -- and what I -- what I tried to 15 answer to a question earlier, it is absolutely clear 16 what Congress was trying to do here. Congress said not 17 to exceed a specific sum from year to year -18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: When the Congressional 19 Budget Office, or whatever agency it is that figures out 20 whether there's a deficit and, if so, of how much, do 21 they look at "not to exceed," and do they take that 22 amount seriously? Or -23 MR. FREEMAN: Oh, oh, absolutely, 24 Your Honor. And -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the -- but the
21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 position of the Respondents is that it makes no 2 difference. 3 MR. FREEMAN: No difference at all. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So Congress is saying nothing 5 at all. 6 MR. FREEMAN: Yes, yes. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It really -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the consequence 9 on the ground is that, if I'm a tribe and I want this 10 money, and I figure out that this is going to cost me 11 $80,000 -12 MR. FREEMAN: Yes. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- I sign a contract 14 and say, this is going to cost me $100,000, because I 15 know there isn't going to be $100,000. There's only 16 going to be $80,000, and that's what I need, right? 17 MR. FREEMAN: Well, in fact, it can't work 18 that way, Your Honor, because the amounts are limited by 19 statute to the reasonable and allowable costs that are 20 not duplicative of the principal program funds, the 21 funds to run the program -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but it's -23 well, if 80,000 is reasonable, the only way to get that 24 is to ask for 100? 25 MR. FREEMAN: Right. And if a tribe thinks
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that we haven't put in to the -- we haven't offered them 2 enough money for their contract support costs, they are 3 allowed to decline the offer that we make. And they 4 can -- unusually, for government contractors, they can 5 file a separate lawsuit before entering into the 6 contract to litigate whether the terms are sufficient. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Freeman, where did 8 these caps come from? Did the agency initiate them? 9 Or, there's a chart -- perhaps I don't understand it 10 correctly. It's on page 210 of the joint appendix. It 11 does -- it does seem to indicate that it was the BIA 12 that proposed the cutback. 13 MR. FREEMAN: The caps come from Congress, 14 Your Honor. Respondents have make -- have made an 15 argument at the end of their brief that the government 16 should be liable here notwithstanding the caps because 17 the BIA hasn't requested sufficient funding from 18 Congress -- or, rather, the President hasn't requested 19 sufficient funding from Congress. 20 That argument, we think, is baseless for a 21 number of reasons. And just as a factual matter, the 22 GAO has done some studies of this. There are reports in 23 the joint appendix explaining why BIA has not in every 24 year asked for what turned out to be enough money. 25 And that's because these -- this funding is
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 done on a prospective estimated basis. And because 2 we're required to take into -- we are required to accept 3 every contract that comes in the door, BIA may estimate 4 and make its best available estimate, and OMB and the 5 President may accept that if he chooses, but it still 6 may turn out not to be enough. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not really relevant 8 here anyway, is it? 9 MR. FREEMAN: No, it is not. It is not 10 relevant, Your Honor. No. That's right. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: What I don't understand is 12 why the language "not to exceed" is any different from 13 Congress appropriating $900,000. You mean the world 14 changes if -- if Congress, instead of just appropriating 15 $900,000, authorizes the Secretary to expend not to 16 exceed $900,000? Why -17 MR. FREEMAN: I don't think in that 18 circumstance there would be any difference. Here, the 19 reason why it's different is that this is ultimately a 20 question of what Congress was trying to do. There's no 21 constitutional argument that Congress can't enact these 22 kind of caps, and we know from the "not to exceed" 23 language that Congress was being as emphatic as it 24 could. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I would think
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 $900,000 is pretty emphatic, if that's all you 2 appropriate. 3 MR. FREEMAN: Right. And just -- it's just 4 this is the way, as an ordinary matter, that in 5 appropriations Congress expresses an internal cap. It 6 said -7 JUSTICE KAGAN: But that runs you right into 8 Ferris. Then you're saying that there's no difference 9 between the standard Ferris-type appropriation, which is 10 just an amount of money, and this kind of appropriation, 11 which is up to or not to exceed that amount of money. 12 MR. FREEMAN: Your Honor, Ferris we think is 13 inapplicable just to this type of statutory scheme where 14 we're required to enter into the contracts, and there's 15 a limited sum available. That's Judge Dyk's reasoning 16 in the Federal Circuit. But let me put that aside for 17 the moment and address Ferris directly. 18 As I said before, Ferris is about the 19 circumstance in which there are enough available funds 20 in the first instance to pay the contractual 21 obligations. 22 Now, Ferris does not and cannot stand for 23 the proposition that an executive officer, looking at 24 the amount Congress made available in the first 25 instance, can bind the Treasury to pay more than
25

1 Congress has expressly stated he may bind it to. This 2 Court has said many, many times -3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it the Respondents' 4 position is that the contracting officer says, now, this 5 is going to go over the not to exceed amount, but not to 6 worry, just sue us under the Judgment -- just sue us 7 under the Judgment Act. 8 MR. FREEMAN: Right. And there is no reason 9 to think that Congress contemplated such a scheme, which 10 would amount to essentially giving full contract support 11 cost funding, but only for the tribes who have the 12 resources and sophistication to sue, minus litigation 13 costs. That makes no sense at all. When Congress says 14 "not to exceed," a certain amount of money may come out 15 of the Treasury -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It makes sense if 17 you're looking at the reality of the budgeting process 18 because in one case, that line item appears on the 19 Department of Interior budget; and in the other case, it 20 appears somewhere else in the Judgment Fund budget. And 21 they can say it's not our fault. The Judgment Fund -22 the Court made us do it -23 MR. FREEMAN: Well, I don't think so, 24 Your Honor. The Judgment Fund is not a new thing. The 25 Judgment Fund is available only to pay judgments validly

1 entered against the United States. 2 Now, we don't dispute that it's available to 3 pay breach of contract damages. But of course, a breach 4 of contract requires a violation of -- a violation, a 5 failure to perform a binding contractual promise. 6 Now, we think we've performed our promise 7 here because our -- our promise was to pay the sums that 8 Congress made lawfully available. And we think that, to 9 the extent Respondents think we promised to pay more 10 than Congress explicitly said could be available, the 11 Secretary had no authority to enter into that promise. 12 Now -13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's true of every 14 contract. That's where I'm getting stuck on what your 15 theory is. The Antideficiency Act says you can't spend 16 more than you're given. 17 MR. FREEMAN: Yes. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So every single 19 contractor, under your logic, should know that when they 20 sign a contract, the government can break it because if 21 it doesn't have enough funds, it can't pay. 22 MR. FREEMAN: And, Your Honor, that -23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- so there's no 24 real logic to your argument, other than to say we 25 can't -- we're -- if the contract says "subject to
27

1 appropriations," let's do away with Ferris, let's do 2 away with Cherokee Nation, and -3 MR. FREEMAN: No, no -4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- it just means that we 5 pay you what we can. 6 MR. FREEMAN: No. That -- that is 7 emphatically not true. As -- as an initial matter, as 8 I've tried to explain before, there are very strict 9 requirements in the government's contracting processes, 10 such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that limit 11 the ability of the government to make promises it 12 can't keep, particularly with regard to funding. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what you're saying 14 is you make two promises on the ISDA. We're going to 15 pay you your support costs, your administrative costs, 16 in full, and we're going to retain the right to break 17 that promise. That's really what you're saying the ISDA 18 says. 19 MR. FREEMAN: No. That's not right, 20 Your Honor. And I -- I'll answer this, and then I'd 21 like to reserve the balance of my time. 22 The ISDA says our promise is to pay you what 23 Congress lets us pay you. It's not breaking our promise 24 to limit it to appropriation. It is keeping our 25 promise.

1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you ignore all the 2 language where it says we're going to pay you X amount, 3 all the law that says you have to be reimbursed -- the 4 tribes have to be reimbursed for all their costs. 5 All of that is going to be ignored. 6 MR. FREEMAN: Well, it's not that it's 7 ignored, it's that section 450j-1(b) says, 8 "notwithstanding any other provision of this Act," and 9 we think that's fairly clear. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 11 Mr. Phillips. 12 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G.

PHILLIPS: The place where "not to 17 exceed," I think, carries particular significance is 18 that in the ordinary situation, we would be entitled to 19 seek injunctive relief to take money from other sources 20 within -- within the budget and get an injunction. And 21 that's very unique to the -- to this context. 22 Ordinarily, government contractors cannot seek 23 injunctive relief.

My question was: I would like the authority 23 for the proposition that when you have a set of 24 contractors, and they read their contract, and it says 25 "subject to appropriation," and then you read the law,
33

Alderson Reporting Company

1 and it says they will not be paid, it shall not exceed 2 $4 million, and then you discover that the amount of the 3 contracts of the same kind in this category are more 4 than $4 million, I want to know where in the Redbook it 5 says that they get paid more than $4 million. 6 That's all. That's fairly simple. 7 And if that's -- if that's normal practice, 8 it must be there's a lot of authority for it. So I -- I 9 just want to know what to read. 10 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, here, 6-45 says, "if a 11 contract is but one activity under a larger 12 appropriation, it is not reasonable to expect the 13 contractor to know how much of that 14 appropriation remains available." 15 JUSTICE BREYER: But they aren't talking 16 about there where it says specifically in the contract 17 "subject to appropriations." At least I think they're 18 not. 19 Now, I would like you right now to tell me, 20 no, you're wrong; it does say that. 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it says, if Congress 22 appropriates a specific dollar amount for a particular 23 contract -24 JUSTICE BREYER: They're distinguishing 25 Sutton from Ferris.

1 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry? 2 JUSTICE BREYER: They're trying to use that 3 to distinguish Sutton from Ferris, and it's filled with, 4 well, we're not sure about this because Sutton, which is 5 Brandeis, which comes out the opposite way, did have a 6 line appropriation. And I thought that just refers to 7 the fact that because there's a line appropriation, the 8 contractor's on notice. 9 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Exactly. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. 11 And when you do business with the government 12 over a period of years, and it says "subject to 13 appropriation," not necessarily you but your lawyer, 14 who's a good lawyer, should look up and see what the 15 appropriation is or whether it was made. And that's 16 what I gather -17 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer, as a matter 18 of policy -- you know, if Congress -19 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, not as a matter of 20 policy. I'm putting it as a question because that was 21 my first reaction. And I expect you to say, no, Justice 22 Breyer -23 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, clearly -24 JUSTICE BREYER: -- you're wrong, and that 25 isn't the practice, and here is what I read to show that
35

1 isn't the practice. That's all I'm asking. 2 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I guess I don't 3 understand exactly how to answer that question, Justice 4 Breyer, because -5 JUSTICE BREYER: By showing me where in the 6 law it says -- and I don't want to repeat the question 7 for the third time, but it says -8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I wish you would. I've 9 lost the question. 10 (Laughter.) 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, here sometimes not 12 everyone pays sufficient attention to these very clear 13 questions. 14 (Laughter.) 15 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm doing my best, 16 Justice Breyer. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Where -- look, 18 hypothetical. Four people, four identical contracts, 19 the words appear, "subject to appropriation." 20 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: Each is for a million 22 dollars. 23 Then you read the appropriation that was 24 later made, and in that statute, it says, we hereby 25 appropriate $3 million, and -- it is, the payments are
36

Alderson Reporting Company

1 not to exceed $3 million. 2 Okay? Something like that. 3 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: All I want is the authority 5 that says each of those four people can come in and get 6 the $1 million, totaling $4 million. I want the 7 authority that says that. 8 MR. PHILLIPS: I mean, I would read Ferris 9 as if -10 JUSTICE BREYER: No. Ferris -- it did not say 11 anything about it in the contract. 12 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, Ferris has a 13 limitation. The -- the government has already told us 14 that "subject to appropriation" is implicit in every -15 in every agreement anyway, so there's nothing special 16 about putting in the words "subject to appropriation." 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, there certainly is. 18 Putting in the words gives the lawyer notice. 19 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, again, the only notice 20 it gives is that there has to be enough money when you 21 look at the appropriation to cover your contract. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ferris did not say, as I 23 recall, that you can't expect the contractor to have 24 notice that appropriations have been limited. It said 25 you can't expect them to have notice as to how much of
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the expenditures under that appropriated act have been 2 spent. Isn't that the only thing it required notice of? 3 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. That's -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would think, if you sign 5 a contract, you better be sure that there are 6 appropriations for it. 7 MR. PHILLIPS: Clearly. And that -- I mean, 8 and, Justice Breyer, the Court's opinion in Cherokee 9 said that the primary purpose of the subject to 10 availability clause is to deal with the situation where 11 you enter into the agreement ahead of the fiscal year, 12 and so everybody knows that if Congress, for whatever 13 reason, decides not to appropriate any money, there's no 14 deal, and nothing happens. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, in your view, if the 16 tribe comes to the government, and they say, look, we've 17 been looking at what you've done with the other tribes, 18 you've appropriated $95 million, and the appropriation 19 says "not to exceed $95 million," but go ahead and make 20 this contract with us anyway, no one cares. And you 21 say, go ahead and make it. Right? 22 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, it seems to me 23 it's the government's problem to sort out. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's your -- that's your 25 position, isn't it?
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But, again, put it in 2 the context, Justice Kennedy, of the individual tribe. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can't get it from 4 Cherokee. I mean, yes, there's Ferris, and then 5 Cherokee -6 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- is relying on Ferris. 8 But Cherokee was very careful to point out that there 9 were funds to cover the cost -10 MR. PHILLIPS: No question about it, Justice 11 Ginsburg. I don't think this case is controlled by 12 Cherokee. 13 I do think Cherokee answers the question of 14 how far can you carry the "subject to availability" 15 language. I don't think it gets the government anywhere 16 near home. 17 And then the question is, what do you do 18 with the "not to exceed" language. And what I would suggest 19 there is that, that's no different, frankly, from Ferris 20 or any other situation, because what the -- Congress 21 operates against the backdrop of Ferris, which is a 22 120-plus-year-old doctrine that has been allowed to stay 23 in place by Congress for that entire time. And as the 24 Chamber of Commerce tells us, this is a rule that every 25 contractor takes as an article of faith in dealing with
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the United States Government. 2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, am I correct that 3 what the government is arguing is that the fact that 4 this limitation was included in the particular contract 5 makes it different from Ferris? 6 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it's hard to make that 7 argument because the -- the "not to exceed" language, at 8 least, that comes out of the -- that's in the 9 appropriations provision. That's not in the contract 10 itself. The contract itself simply says "subject to 11 appropriations." 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which Ferris did not. Did 13 the Ferris contract say that? 14 MR. PHILLIPS: It's -- Ferris doesn't have 15 the "subject to appropriation," but the Ferris contract 16 says the appropriation limit is X. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: It does? Where do you 18 get -- I couldn't find the contract. The language in 19 Ferris is, "a contractor who is one of several persons 20 to be paid out of an appropriation is not chargeable 21 with knowledge of its administration." True. 22 Now, Dyk says, in his opinion, that one 23 difference from Ferris is they wrote the idea into the 24 contract, saying you're subject to appropriation to 25 get to make that lawyer chargeable with knowledge.
40

1 And the second thing in Ferris is that it 2 was an individual who went off on his own in the 3 administration and paid money that he shouldn't have 4 paid. It should have been over here for the contract. 5 In this case, it is an instance where 6 Congress itself required the money to be paid, as it was 7 paid, and didn't provide enough. Okay. 8 So that's where I am with Ferris, which is a 9 big question mark. And I guess you could talk about 10 that, but all I wanted to know is what is well 11 established in this field. 12 MR. PHILLIPS: Well -13 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't want to write 14 something that suddenly upsets what is well established. 15 MR. PHILLIPS: Okay. Well, I take this, 16 then, straight from the Redbook again. "It is settled 17 that contractors paid from a general appropriation are 18 not barred from recovering for breach of contract, even 19 though the appropriation is exhausted." 20 And so even though -- and there's 21 nothing in -- there's no limitation -22 JUSTICE BREYER: And that is that as it 23 says in the contract, you are barred, you are barred 24 from recovering if we don't appropriate enough money. 25 Should it say that wouldn't matter? Is that right?
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it would say that if 2 you don't appropriate enough money for the specific 3 contract, yes. I think that's clearly what Sutton 4 holds. Is that if -- if Justice Scalia and I have an 5 agreement, and the -- the appropriation goes to $100 for 6 our agreement, and the contract says $500, I'm out of 7 luck for the extra $400. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Phillips, this is an 9 unusual situation with the tribes, because in the normal 10 not to exceed appropriation by Congress, the government 11 rightly says we have the power to not contract. And in 12 military contracts and others, we have a for convenience 13 cancellation. We have all sorts of things that protect 14 us from the deficiency. 15 But this is a unique situation because the 16 government, on the one hand, despite their protestations 17 to the contrary, are forced to accept these contracts. 18 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And on the other hand, 20 Congress is saying, don't pay more on them. We're 21 telling you to accept more payment than we're going to 22 give you. 23 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Should we create a 25 special rule for this -- why shouldn't we create a
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 special rule for this unique situation? 2 MR. PHILLIPS: Because essentially what 3 you're doing is putting the backs of this problem -4 putting the burden of this problem on the backs of -- of 5 innocent contractors who -6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, is it -7 MR. PHILLIPS: Who entered into in good 8 faith these agreements. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, is it just a 10 question of our creating a new rule, or rather, is the 11 proposition whether the tribes, when they entered into 12 this, should have realized that because of the 13 peculiarity of these contracts that they had to be 14 entered into, that the rule which otherwise would apply 15 does not apply? It ought to be a question of 16 expectation of the tribe, should it not? 17 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I would -- I would 18 suggest a couple things about that. I mean, I think in 19 general it's reasonable to look for the -- obviously, 20 the intent of the parties and the expectations of the 21 parties. 22 This case went off on summary judgment that 23 we lost. I mean, even on a -- so we didn't have an 24 opportunity for any analysis of this. So the reality 25 is, is that from the tribe's perspective, they
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 recognize, because of Ferris, and because of the way the 2 Comptroller General has interpreted Ferris, that they 3 are under a duty to make sure that there is an 4 appropriation that covers this contract, that the 5 amount, purpose, time requirements are all satisfied 6 with enough money to accomplish that. 7 And then, of course, we have the obligation 8 to perform, which, of course, that's the other half of 9 the equation here. 10 And, Justice Sotomayor, that's why I 11 wouldn't say -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't -- you 13 don't have the obligation to perform. I mean -- right? 14 In a term of the contract, that their lack of 15 sufficient appropriations, performance by either party 16 is excused. 17 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that -- yes, 18 Justice Ginsburg. But the problem is, we don't know the 19 answer to that until after the year of performance is 20 done, or at least months into the performance. And 21 sometimes, literally after we've already performed -22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you did know. 23 Suppose the tribe knew that the 95 million -- let's 24 assume that that's the not to exceed amount -- had 25 already been obligated. Could the tribe then go ahead
44

1 and make the government -- a contract with the 2 government, and would the government have to make that 3 contract, in your view? 4 MR. PHILLIPS: I mean, that -- that is the 5 Southern Ute case. And I -- and certainly, you can make 6 an argument to that. The government has an argument on 7 the other side. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it your argument that 9 the answer to that is yes? 10 MR. PHILLIPS: The argument is, it appears 11 that Congress intended to require them to enter into 12 that agreement. You know, the idea of Congress 13 requiring the -- an official to enter into an agreement 14 that violates a criminal statute is at least a -- a 15 difficult concept to sort of wrap your mind around. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't this more specific 17 language than the general language? Doesn't this 18 specific language, "not to exceed," supersede the 19 general obligation to make the contract? Otherwise, 20 it's meaningless. The "not to exceed language" is 21 meaningless. 22 MR. PHILLIPS: No, but -23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You say it's meaningless. 24 MR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice Kennedy. I told 25 you what the meaning of the "not to exceed" language is.
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 The "not to exceed" language ensures that we 2 cannot turn to the BIA or anyone else at the Interior 3 and say, give us money from another source in order to 4 pay for our contract. And we can't use the injunctive 5 relief that's otherwise available to us for that 6 purpose. 7 So that language has very significant 8 importance in limiting what our options are -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips -10 MR. PHILLIPS: -- in a circumstance where we 11 are not being paid enough under the -- the agreement. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- do I understand your 13 position to be that, yes, the cap has meaning, because 14 in order to exceed the cap, the tribe has to sue? So, 15 any tribe that sues, for any tribe that sues, the cap is 16 meaningless? It's only for the ones who are not 17 sophisticated enough to sue. They're just stuck with 18 what Congress said. 19 So it seems to me that would be a very 20 bizarre scheme to set up that, that you have a cap, but the 21 cap is meaningless if you bring a lawsuit. 22 MR. PHILLIPS: No. I -- I mean, I -- it 23 seems to me that we can't -- I mean, aside from bringing 24 a lawsuit, I mean, we -- we could go to the Secretary 25 and say, we don't have enough money to satisfy our
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 contract, would you take money from some other source in 2 order to accomplish that. 3 Because, in the ordinary course, that's not 4 uncommon to re -- re-jigger the -- the appropriation. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think it protects 6 these -- these unsophisticated tribes who don't know 7 enough to sue by not allowing anybody to sue? 8 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that -- yes, there 9 is -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does that make their 11 situation better somehow? 12 MR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, that would not 13 make our situation any better, but -14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: My question is whether 15 the cap was meaningless. And I think your answer is, 16 yes, for anyone who sues, the cap is meaningless. 17 MR. PHILLIPS: No. No. It -- I don't -- I 18 don't think it does that. It -- it places inherent 19 limitations -- I mean, it says specifically that the 20 Secretary is not authorized to shift money around in 21 order to take care of this particular problem in this 22 particular year that otherwise would be available to us. 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You just go to the 24 Judgment Fund -25 MR.

The 10 Judgment Fund -- this is not simply going to the 11 Judgment Fund and asking for our contract support costs 12 to be paid. Our argument here is that there has been a 13 breach of contract, and we're entitled to the damages 14 for the breach of contract, whether those are reliance 15 damages or restitutionary damages, whether we -- whether 16 we're supposed to get what we expected out of the deal, 17 or put back in the position we would have been in -18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, if you look at 19 this situation, it seems pretty clear that Congress did 20 want to do something, which was to limit the amount of 21 money that was going to the tribes under these 22 contracts. 23 Do you think that there's a way that 24 Congress can do that -25 MR.

1 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- consistent with this 2 scheme that's set up by the statute? 3 How could Congress do that? You know, if -4 if -- if they can't do it this way, how could they? 5 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the easy way would be 6 to impose specific limitations in -- in every one of the 7 contracts, which -- which, frankly, if you read 8 appropriations bills, which I hate to say I have 9 occasionally done -10 JUSTICE KAGAN: When you say "specific 11 limitations," what would that look like? 12 MR. PHILLIPS: It would look like -- for the 13 agreement between the United States and Ramah Navajo 14 for -- for contract support costs in this 15 particular -- for taking over the police department, the 16 contract support costs shall not exceed $150,000, 17 period. That's the total appropriation. 18 And if we look at our contract -- and 19 there's a specific number in the contract -- and that 20 contract number says $174,000, then we know that we're 21 out of luck for the $24,000. We've been put on specific 22 notice -23 JUSTICE ALITO: For any particular year, are 24 they all entered into it at about the same time? 25 MR. PHILLIPS: What's that, Justice Alito?

1 JUSTICE ALITO: For any particular fiscal 2 year, are all of these contracts entered into by a 3 particular date? 4 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Nothing is all that 5 easy, obviously. Some of them enter into it on a fiscal 6 year basis. Some of them enter into it on a -- on 7 a -- on a calendar year basis. 8 And, frankly, the -- part of the problem is 9 when does the government get around to signing these 10 agreements. 11 And, also, there are 12 regions. I mean, 12 part of the reason -- I would like to spend a second 13 talking about the comment that, you know, we have this 14 fair and equitable scheme in place in which we're 15 allocating moneys out, when the reality is, is that 16 there is substantial evidence in the record, even though 17 we have not had an opportunity to make a full record, 18 that the -- that the -- that the Bureau makes mistakes 19 in 40 percent of these contractual arrangements. 20 And I know my -- my colleague's going to 21 dispute that, but the truth is we've known that for 22 years. They just make mistakes, and people get 23 impaired -- their contract rights are impaired on that 24 basis. 25 This is not some kind of an equitable scheme

1 that's operating here. There are 12 different regions 2 operating in 12 different ways. Some people get money, 3 some people get 300 percent of theirs, some people get 4 0 percent of theirs. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Phillips, how does 6 Congress do this without upsetting the entire 7 scheme? Knowing that these contracts are not all signed 8 on one day, that there are 12 regions, that the 9 negotiations go over time, how could Congress achieve 10 the scheme that the government wants now? How would it 11 write this contract? 12 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the easy way 13 would be to take away the requirement that the 14 government has to enter into all of these contracts at 15 the request of the tribe. And -- and -- and that's 16 clearly available. If they want to go down that path, 17 they can do that in a heartbeat. And then they have all 18 of the discretion they want -- they want to apply under 19 these circumstances. 20 So, I mean, there's -- obviously, there is a 21 bit of, as we said in the brief, schizophrenia. And I 22 have -- I have some misgivings about describing Congress 23 that way, but there is some schizophrenia in how they 24 approach this problem. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have to solve it

Couldn't there be a -- a 2 provision in the -- in the law which -- which says that, 3 where appropriated funds are inadequate to cover the 4 totality of -- of costs under this statute, it will be 5 apportioned as follows? 6 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Congress could -7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or the Secretary will 8 apportion it? That's all it would take. You wouldn't 9 even have to do it contract by contract. Right? 10 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I -- I mean, I think 11 that would -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: You would prefer contract 13 by contract for your clients. 14 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I just think it's been 15 noted -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, absolutely -17 MR. PHILLIPS: -- but, you know, I don't 18 disagree with that. 19 Look, and as we argued in our brief, there 20 are three or four different ways that Congress can fix 21 this problem going forward. But -- and that's -- and 22 that's the message, I thought, from Justice Sotomayor, 23 is why don't we let Congress fix the problem and allow 24 the background principles of Ferris, as interpreted by 25 the Comptroller General, to apply in this case in order

1 to resolve the contract dispute that's properly, 2 obviously, before the Court at this point. 3 I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think -- I think 5 this may have been asked, and I'm not sure of the -- I 6 understood the answer. 7 This is -- is this on an ongoing, 8 forward-looking basis? In other words, you enter into 9 the contracts, and then you wait and see whether there 10 are appropriations? 11 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Typically what happens 12 is you enter into the agreement sometime just before the 13 appropriation comes down. It's -- it's usually pretty 14 close, because -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so doesn't it 16 make -- I mean, doesn't the system that the government 17 is operating under make a lot of sense? Because let's 18 say the tribe says, look, we need a million dollars. 19 The Secretary agrees to it. And then I assume the two 20 of them get together and say, well, we'll try to get the 21 appropriation for it. You know, you understand we may 22 not get it, but this is how much you need, we'll go back 23 and get it. If you get it, that's great. If you don't, 24 well, then that's -25 MR. PHILLIPS: And again -- and, Mr. Chief
53

1 Justice, if they did that on a -- on a tribe-by-tribe, 2 contract-by-contract basis, I -- I wouldn't have any 3 problem with that, because then you're on notice. 4 But when they say to you, okay, fine, 5 here's -- you know, this is -- here is your contract 6 support cost provision, there's a specific number in 7 there, 1.3.78 dollars and 63 cents, that's what you 8 ought to get, and we get an appropriation that comes 9 back in that says the government will -- that, you know, 10 we have appropriated $100 million for contract support 11 costs. 12 There are 330 other tribes out there 13 potentially with contracts that are involved here. It 14 is -- and -- and just to put it in context, we are 15 talking about -- you know, many of these tribes are in 16 incredibly remote situations. They don't have access to 17 all the other information about what's going on. And 18 the real question is, should you impose -19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you 20 suggesting that -21 MR. PHILLIPS: -- that on the tribes? 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you suggesting 23 that Congress has to go through each of those contracts 24 and say, this is how much we're going to appropriate, 25 this is how much -

1 MR. PHILLIPS: I think that's -- I actually 2 think that would be the fairer way to do it. And I 3 don't think it would be as burdensome as -- as your 4 question implies, because, again, what else does staff 5 have better to do than to sit down and put all those 6 appropriations together? 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the question 8 is whether it's the staff in Congress that's going to do 9 it or the staff at the Department of the Interior? 10 MR. PHILLIPS: Well -11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I suppose 12 Congress can reasonably determine that the people at 13 Interior know better about how to do it than we do. 14 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But then -- then they 15 could do it by -- by -- expressly by reference. 16 I mean, if, in fact, Interior has set it out 17 that way and has it all done, then they can just 18 incorporate it into the statute anyway. 19 I mean, there are simple ways to do it. 20 There are broader ways to do it. And as I said to 21 Justice Sotomayor, clearly Congress could simply, you 22 know, absolve the government of its responsibility to 23 enter into any contract that a -- that a -- when an 24 Indian tribe shows up at their doorstep. 25 All of those seem to me preferable than

1 saying to the tribes, after they have fully performed 2 their side of the deal, okay, I'm sorry, we're not going 3 to pay you. 4 The -- the other thing that's odd about 5 this -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You keep 7 saying that, but I thought in your earlier answer, you 8 said that the contracts are generally signed by the time 9 of the appropriation. 10 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where is that in the 12 cycle of performance? Is that at the beginning of 13 performance? 14 MR. PHILLIPS: That's at the beginning of 15 performance. But -- but what we find out about the 16 notices that we are -- that we have later receive is at 17 some point, we're sending you 75 percent in some 18 situations, or we're going to send you exactly the same 19 amount of money you got last year, even though that 20 won't cover it. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the tribes -- even 22 when the appropriation comes out, they don't know how 23 much the Department has contracted with other tribes. 24 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. We haven't -25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So they're performing

1 until they get that notice later on. 2 MR. PHILLIPS: Exactly. And, candidly, 3 assume that -- either one of two things will happen. 4 Either we will ultimately be paid in full, which has 5 happened -- I mean, the last year, they were in fact 6 paid in full. Or alternatively, that they will have 7 access to the Judgment Fund in order to -- to get the 8 recovery they are otherwise entitled to. 9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, do you 10 think -- and the long question here is what did Congress 11 want. And what -- one answer might be Congress wanted 12 exactly what the government says it wanted. But another 13 answer might be something different, that actually, 14 Congress wanted there to be unlimited funds for these 15 tribes, but that it wanted to shift the costs of some of 16 those funds to the Judgment Fund outside of the Interior 17 budget. 18 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you -- I mean, do you 20 contest the government's view of what Congress wanted 21 here? And if so, how? 22 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the question is 23 it's unclear what Congress really wanted in this case, 24 and therefore, you ought to construe the -- the scheme 25 in a way that is most favorable to the tribes. And if
57

1 that means that the scheme operates so as to protect the 2 integrity of the appropriations process and the spending 3 process for a particular year, and prevents us from 4 being able to seek relief outside of this contract 5 support cost appropriation limitation, that makes 6 perfect sense to me, leaving open obviously the 7 availability of the Judgment Fund at the end of the day 8 so that the tribes do not in fact have to bear the full 9 burden of -- of this arrangement as opposed to -- as 10 opposed to anyone else. 11 I mean, that's -- again, we do 12 provide -- we've performed the services. We don't know. 13 We do it in good faith. Under those circumstances, it 14 seems to me that's the classic situation in which we 15 should receive full compensation. 16 If there are no further questions, Your 17 Honor, thank you. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 19 Mr. Phillips. 20 Mr. Freeman, you have 4 minutes remaining. 21 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. FREEMAN 22 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 23 MR. FREEMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you dispute 25 Mr. Phillips' statement that the tribes don't know how
58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 much they're getting until some point further into the 2 performance cycle? 3 MR. FREEMAN: In part, Your Honor. Let me 4 explain. As I mentioned earlier, for the first many 5 years in this scheme, we did a uniform pro rata 6 distribution methodology. The tribes came to us and 7 said, look, that's a problem for us because we don't 8 have any budget transparency; we can't see how much 9 we're going to get. So we adopted this policy in 2006. 10 And one of the principal elements of that policy is that 11 it guarantees that, if -- as long as Congress 12 appropriates as much money as it did in the previous 13 fiscal year, which it generally has, the tribe will get 14 immediately, like within 2 weeks, the exact amount of 15 money that it received in the previous year. And that 16 money comes immediately. They can use it however they 17 want. It's not subject to apportionment. Unlike most 18 Federal agencies, we don't dole it out. They get it 19 right away. 20 Now, the question then becomes what to do 21 with any additional money that Congress has 22 appropriated, and the policy provides for distribution 23 of that money on what we call a bottoms-up basis. We 24 give it to the tribes that are the farthest away from 25 100 percent of funding. That resolution was negotiated

1 with the tribes and, indeed, with some counsel for 2 Respondents. It's, we think -- and I might be wrong 3 about this -- but we think that that's the solution that 4 the tribes want, if the caps have any effect. There 5 are -6 JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess what I don't 7 understand about the government's argument, Mr. Freeman, 8 is exactly what the contractual rights of the tribes 9 become. I mean, as I -- this is supposed to be a 10 contract, and we've held that it's a contract, and 11 usually contracting parties have rights to something. 12 MR. FREEMAN: Yes. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: So what do they have a right 14 to, in your view? 15 MR. FREEMAN: Well, first of all, let's make 16 clear -- let's make sure that we're not -17 JUSTICE KAGAN: That was -- that was a 18 straightforward question. 19 (Laughter.) 20 MR. FREEMAN: Well, they have a right, Your 21 Honor, in the first instance to the principal promise 22 that's under any ISDA contract, which is we give the 23 amount of money that the Secretary would have provided 24 for the program funds, for operational -25 JUSTICE KAGAN: No, but what do they have a

They 4 have a right as a class to the distribution of every 5 dollar that Congress appropriates, and for every 6 contractor -7 JUSTICE KAGAN: What does each individual 8 tribe have a right to? 9 MR. FREEMAN: A proportionate share based on 10 the Secretary's policy for the distribution of these in 11 light of the caps. Let me -12 JUSTICE KAGAN: So you think they do have a 13 right to a pro rata share? 14 MR. FREEMAN: We think that -15 JUSTICE KAGAN: In other words, the 16 Secretary could not say, oh, you know, these tribes have 17 been doing a better job, so we'll give it to them; or 18 these tribes need it more, so we'll give it to them. 19 You think that there's a contractual right to a pro rata 20 share. 21 MR. FREEMAN: We think there's a contractual 22 right to -- and, in fact, the contracts often reference 23 these policies directly. For example, page 123 of the 24 joint appendix, one of the contracts in this case says 25 you'll be paid according to the distribution policy as

Does the Secretary -5 Justice Kagan can defend her own question -- but does 6 the Secretary have the discretion to adopt something 7 other than a pro rata distribution when there are not 8 sufficient appropriations? 9 MR.

1 very -- this is a very strange kind of contractual 2 right. The -- the contracting tribe has a right to have 3 the Secretary use discretion to decide how much the 4 contracting tribe gets. 5 What kind of contract is that? 6 (Laughter.) 7 MR. FREEMAN: Respectfully -- respectfully, 8 Your Honor, that is an exaggeration. Congress has 9 appropriated since 1994 more than $2.3 billion in 10 contract support cost funds. We've distributed all of 11 that money to the tribes. All of the tribes here have 12 gotten substantial sums. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: No, I'm not contesting -- I 14 mean, clearly you think and the Secretary thinks that 15 there's an obligation to distribute all that money. 16 MR. FREEMAN: Right. 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and I don't think 18 anybody disagrees with that. The question is what each 19 individual tribe has a contractual right to. 20 MR. FREEMAN: May I answer the question, 21 Your Honor? 22 Your Honor, once it is clear that the caps 23 control the total amount of money that the Secretary may 24 spend, every further question is a question of 25 allocation.
