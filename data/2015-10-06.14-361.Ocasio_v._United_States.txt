3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Case 14361, Ocasio v.

5 United States.

6             Mr. Davis.

7             ORAL ARGUMENT OF ETHAN P. DAVIS

8               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9             MR. DAVIS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11             The Hobbs Act requires that a defendant

12 obtain property from another.  In this case, Mr. Ocasio

13 was charged with conspiring with the owners of a repair

14 shop not to obtain property from another, but from the

15 owners themselves.

16             The plain language of the Hobbs Act resolves

17 this case.  When two people agree that one will pay the

18 other a bribe, they have merely agreed to exchange

19 property between themselves, not to obtain property from

20 another.  The historical background, the statutory

21 structure, and basic criminal  principles of criminal

22 law all point in the same direction.  There are no old

23 English or State cases involving conspiracies to extort

24 property from a coconspirator.

25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does that mean that you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 would have to  in order to get at this  this

4

2 venture, you would have to bring two separate

3 prosecutions, one against your client for the extortion,

4 and then a separate crime  a separate prosecution in

5 State court against the body shop owners?

6             MR. DAVIS:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I think

7 that is correct.  Maryland has a bribery statute that

8 might apply in a situation like this.  And Congress has

9 passed a bribery statute targeted to bribery of State

10 and local officials, 18 U.S.C. 666, that may or may not

11 apply to the repair shop owners.  But we don't think

12 they could be convicted of 

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it  is it well

14 established, or even not well established, that you are

15 obtaining property under color of law when you give

16 somebody a bribe?

17             MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor 

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me  what that

19 means to me under color of law is you  you pretend to

20 have a legal right to it, which in fact you don't have.

21             MR. DAVIS:  Justice Scalia, until 1992, I

22 think that was an open question, but this Court decided

23 in Evans v. United States in '92 that Hobbs Act

24 extortion encompasses the paying of  of bribes.

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I dissented, I assume.

Alderson Reporting Company

1             (Laughter.)

5

2             MR. DAVIS:  You did.  But, Your Honor, I

3 think that that  the decision in Evans was really the

4 highwater mark of this Court's Hobbs Act jurisprudence.

5 And since then the Court has been careful not to expand

6 the Hobbs Act 

7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, we have stated that

8 a person may be liable for conspiracy even though he was

9 incapable of committing the substantive offense.  Does

10 that carry the day for the government's argument here,

11 or is that distinguishable at principle?

12             MR. DAVIS:  I think that's distinguishable

13 in principle, Justice Kennedy.

14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And why?

15             MR. DAVIS:  Well, certainly not every

16 conspirator must personally commit every element of the

17 substantive offense.

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But he might not even be

19 capable of it, must not even be capable of it, as I

20 understand what we've said.

21             MR. DAVIS:  That's correct, Your Honor.

22 Must  need not even be capable of committing every

23 element of the substantive offense, but each conspirator

24 must specifically intend that someone commit every

25 element of the substantive offense.  And 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why isn't that test

6

2 satisfied here, because the shop owners agreed that

3 Mr. Ocasio would commit every element of the substantive

4 offense?

5             MR. DAVIS:  The shop owners, Your Honor,

6 agree that Mr. Ocasio would obtain property from

7 another, not from themselves.  So I think that 

8             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the  the 

9 Mr. Ocasio is committing every element of the

10 substantive offense.  He is obtaining property from

11 another; that is, he's obtaining property from the body

12 shop owners.  And the body shop owners agreed that he

13 would do so.

14             So it seems to me that in the normal way

15 that conspiracy law works, there is a conspiracy here.

16             MR. DAVIS:  Justice Kagan, I don't think

17 that's quite right.  I think that there must be a unity

18 of purpose in conspiracy law.  And the  Mr. Ocasio may

19 have agreed to obtain property from another, but the

20 body shop owners agreed to obtain property from

21 themselves; so there's no unity of purpose.

22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  They only need to agree that

23 he should obtain property from another, and that is

24 exactly what they agreed to.

25             MR. DAVIS:  Justice Kagan, I think the best

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
7 1 way to approach your question is through imagining how 2 this would happen in ordinary English.  The government 3 has a John and Susan  has its response to our John and 4 Susan hypothetical in its brief.  It says, John would go 5 to Susan and say, let us agree that I will obtain 6 property from another, namely, you.  And you notice how 7 much work the words "namely you" are doing in the 8 government's hypothetical.  They're redefining the word 9 "another" to mean the opposite of its ordinary meaning, 10 not  11             JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that any stranger than 12 the Mann Act situation, where the woman who is being 13 transported across State lines for immoral purposes, 14 conspires with the person who is transporting her across 15 State lines?  That's permissible, isn't it? 16             MR. DAVIS:  Justice Alito, I think yes, it 17 is.  And two distinctions from the Mann Act cases:  The 18 first is that the Mann Act used the phrase "any woman," 19 not "another woman."  I think that case would have been 20 different if it had used the phrase "another woman." 21             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, "any woman" is broader 22 than "another woman."  "Any woman" means any of 23 3.5 billionplus women in the world, and that subsumes 24 "another woman," doesn't it? 25             MR. DAVIS:  I don't think so, Your Honor.  I
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 mean, I think that if a woman agreed to transport any

8

2 woman, it makes sense to think that she could transport

3 herself across State lines, but if the statute had said

4 "another woman," it doesn't make sense to say that she

5 could have transported another woman when she was merely

6 transporting herself.

7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, they're two different

8 words, but the syntactical problem seems to me to be

9 identical, which is that it's just not natural to say

10 that the transported woman is herself transporting any

11 woman, right?  I mean, the transported woman is not

12 transporting any woman.

13             But the reason the Court said that a

14 conspiracy was possible there was because the

15 transported woman could agree with another person, let's

16 say, the man, that the man would transport any woman,

17 namely, herself.  It's  it's an almost identical

18 syntactical issue.

19             MR. DAVIS:  I don't think so, Your Honor.  I

20 think that transporting another woman would create a

21 much bigger textual issue than transporting any woman.

22             If the woman goes to the man who is

23 transporting her and says, I'd like to help you

24 transport another woman, he would think that she is

25 talking about someone else, not about herself.  It's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 much more natural in the context of "any woman."

9

2             The other reason those cases are

3 distinguishable, Your Honor, is because they use the

4 verb "transport" instead of "obtain."  It's  it's

5 conceivable to transport yourself; it's not really  it

6 doesn't really make sense to obtain property from

7 yourself.

8             So I think those are distinguishable on

9 those grounds.

10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What difference did it

11 make in this  you're  you're not contesting the

12 extortion convictions, right?  You  it's only the

13 conspiracy; is that right?

14             MR. DAVIS:  That's correct, Your Honor, with

15 an asterisk, and that is if we were to prevail here, we

16 would go back to the Fourth Circuit and ask to vacate

17 the substantive convictions also on the basis of

18 spillover prejudice.

19             But for purposes of this appeal, you're

20 correct.

21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And did the addition of

22 the conspiracy conviction affect the sentence?

23             Would it have been different if there had

24 been no conspiracy charge.

25             MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, the sentences ran

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 concurrently.  The difference it made was $600 in

10

2 restitution payments that were attributable to two acts

3 of extortion that were not charged as substantive counts

4 in the indictment.

5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I have a small question,

6 but not unimportant, which is:  Who paid the bribe,

7 Majestic or the brothers?

8             MR. DAVIS:  The brothers paid the bribes,

9 Your Honor, out of 

10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Out of their own

11 pockets, or did they 

12             MR. DAVIS:  Out of the 

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   Majestic, issue a

14 check?

15             MR. DAVIS:  Out of the Majestic bank

16 account, Your Honor.

17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why isn't Majestic

18 the other person here?

19             MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, the government

20 forfeited any argument that Majestic is the "another" by

21 not raising it at any  at any stage in this Court,

22 in  either in its cert stage briefing or in the 

23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Was Majestic a separate

24 corporation or was it just the proprietorshipowned?

25             MR. DAVIS:  The record is a little unclear

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1 on that point.  The testimony, to the extent it shows 2 anything, shows that Majestic was an LLC and then it 3 became a corporation at some point later.  It's not 4 clear when. 5             But I think the government didn't raise that 6 argument for a good reason, and that's because the 7 testimony also showed that Moreno and Mejia were the 8 sole owners of Majestic, and that there was no 9 difference between them in practical effect. 10             So in  in practice, the money really came 11 from the  from Moreno and Mejia, not from  12             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Moreno and Mejia are 13 two  are two people; they're not the same person, 14 right?  So I assume even if it was  let's say it was a 15 partnership, they each would be entitled to half of the 16 money, right? 17             MR. DAVIS:  I think that's  that's 18 correct. 19             JUSTICE ALITO:  So Moreno could conspire 20 with Ocasio to obtain money from Mejia and Mejia 21 could conspire with Ocasio to obtain money from Moreno. 22             MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, I don't think that 23 that theory works in this case because the bribes came 24 from them jointly.  The payments came from them 25 together.  They  they were both aware of what each
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 other were doing and I think that they're

12

2 indistinguishable for purposes of this.

3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did this government argue

4 this proposition as its theory of the case in the trial

5 court or here?

6             MR. DAVIS:  No, not that theory of the case,

7 Your Honor.

8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You  you acknowledge that

9 the  that the police officer is  is guilty of a

10 violation of the Hobbs Act, never mind the conspiracy,

11 but just the Hobbs Act violation.

12             MR. DAVIS:  We're not directly challenging

13 that here, Your Honor.

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, if you don't  if

15 you don't challenge that here, I  as I recall, your

16 briefs say that to disagree with you in this case is to

17 establish a Federal law of bribery for the whole

18 country.  But it seems to me you  you have that once

19 you  once you acknowledge that, never mind the

20 conspiracy charge, but just the substantive Hobbs Act

21 charge.  That's a national bribery law, isn't it?

22             MR. DAVIS:  Justice Scalia, on one side of

23 the transaction, yes, on the public official side of the

24 transaction.  But this Court in Evans did not 

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's all you need

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
13 1 to have a national law against bribery, it seems to me. 2 You just get one of the two, I don't think you have to 3 get both. 4             MR. DAVIS:  Well, Your Honor, if  if this 5 Court were to extend Evans in this case to cover not 6 only the public official side of the transaction but 7 also the private citizen side of the transaction, that 8 would be a dramatic expansion of the law of bribery.  I 9 mean, Evans may or may not have been  have been 10 correct, but I think it was the highwater mark, and the 11 Court has been careful not to  not to extend it even 12 further in the years since. 13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about  what 14 do you do with the government's argument that Ocasio was 15 conspiring with other police officers to get the money 16 from another?  In other words, that conspiracy got money 17 from another, the  the two individuals. 18             MR. DAVIS:  Two responses to that, Your 19 Honor.  The first is that under the jury instructions, 20 the jury could have convicted Ocasio based on a 21 conspiracy solely between him and the repair shop 22 owners, and under this Court's decision in Skilling, if 23 a  if the jury could have returned a legallyinvalid 24 verdict, the conviction has to be reversed. 25             And I think that's a sufficient answer to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1 the question, but my second answer is that we disagree 2 with the government that there was sufficient evidence 3 in the record linking Ocasio with other police officers. 4 The evidence showed only that these police officers were 5 generally aware of what each other were doing.  It 6 didn't show that they formed an agreement to work 7 together.  And under this Court's decision in Kotteakos, 8 it was a hubandspokes conspiracy without the rim 9 enclosing the spokes. 10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think if I'm 11 remembering the government's response to your first 12 point, is that it certainly would have been harmless 13 error in this case. 14             MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, I find that response 15 a little difficult to understand.  The  the trial 16 overwhelmingly focused on linking Ocasio with Moreno and 17 Mejia, not with other police officers.  The vast 18 majority of the testimony was about Moreno and Mejia 19 forming an agreement with Ocasio. 20             The government's whole case went through 21 Moreno and Mejia.  And the government would have had a 22 much more difficult case if it had to prove an agreement 23 between police officers to obtain property from Moreno 24 and Mejia.  There just wasn't that much evidence of such 25 an agreement.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
15 1             Everything, again, went through that, hub of 2 Moreno and Mejia.  So it's hard for me to imagine that 3 it would have been harmless error, let alone that the 4 jury would even have convicted if it had been instructed 5 that it had to find an agreement between multiple police 6 officers. 7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there any difference 8 to your argument based on the government's position that 9 your client was charged under the general conspiracy 10 statute and not the Hobbs Act statute? 11             MR. DAVIS:  Justice Sotomayor, no, I don't 12 think it makes a difference.  The general conspiracy 13 statute just leads  just leads the government straight 14 back to the Hobbs Act.  It punishes each person who 15 conspires to commit an offense against the 16 United States.  The offense gets against the 17 United States here is Hobbs Act extortion.  One of its 18 elements is obtaining the property from another, so I 19 think the general conspiracy statute it leads right back 20 to the Hobbs Act in just maybe an extra step. 21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's my problem, which 22 is it's not an extra step.  You can conspire, if not 23 every  you started by saying that not every 24 conspirator has to be  commit the  of every element 25 of the crime.  So why can't the general conspiracy
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 statute do the work?

16

2             MR. DAVIS:  Well, under the general

3 conspiracy statute, just like under the Hobbs Act, Your

4 Honor, every conspirator has to specifically intend that

5 someone commit every element of the crime.  I think

6 that's been 

7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, is that  that

8 begs Justice Kagan's question, which is they wanted

9 Ocasio  they wanted the police officer to act under

10 color of right and to take the bribe.

11             MR. DAVIS:  And I think the key problem with

12 that, Your Honor, is that the repair shop owners did not

13 intend to help Ocasio obtain property from another.

14 They intended to help Ocasio obtain property from

15 themselves.  And I think that's why there's not a unity

16 of purpose here.

17             I mean, all  everyone may have agreed on

18 the same course of conduct, like the government says.

19 And I think the only way the government can make its

20 interpretation sound plausible is by obscuring the words

21 "from another."

22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, I don't think that's

23 right.  The "from another" is clearly an element of the

24 substantive offense.  But you're saying it should also

25 be a freestanding limit on the conspiracy offense, and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 there's no reason for that to be true.  It is, of

17

2 course, right that somebody has to obtain property from

3 another, but the conspiracy offense is made out if two

4 people agree that somebody should obtain property from

5 another.  And that's exactly the situation here.

6             MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, I think that, again,

7 the repair shop owners did not intend to obtain property

8 from another.  And  and I think the way that 

9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  They intended and they

10 agreed that Mr. Ocasio should obtain property from

11 another.  And that's all they have to do.

12             MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, I think going back

13 to how that kind of conversation would happen in

14 ordinary English is a way to see why it's not plausible

15 to read the statute like that.

16             If the repair shop owners go to Ocasio and

17 say, I want to help you obtain property from another,

18 Ocasio would think that they're talking about someone

19 else.  I think the government's interpretation is much

20 more formalistic.

21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's a statute, and the

22 statute just says the other has to be somebody different

23 from Ocasio himself.  So in this particular case, the

24 somebody other is the people who are in the agreement.

25 In another case, the somebody other might be somebody

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 who is outside the agreement.  The statute just 

18

2 the  the substantive law says it has to be from

3 another.

4             The conspiracy  and this is just  it's

5 consistent with Salinas, it's consistent with Holt, it's

6 consistent with everything we've ever said about

7 conspiracy law  is that it just has to be an agreement

8 for somebody to do that substantive offense even if the

9 people agree and can't do it themselves.

10             And it's true, the people agreeing can't do

11 it themselves.  They can't obtain property from another.

12 But Mr. Ocasio can, and they're agreeing that he should.

13             MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, even if that's a

14 plausible interpretation of the statute, which we don't

15 think it is, it's definitely not the most natural way to

16 read it.  If you talk to any  any nonlawyer about the

17 statute, they would  they would say that if you agree

18 to form  if you agree to obtain property from another,

19 you'd be talking about someone outside the conspiracy.

20             And, you know, the government's

21 interpretation also requires you to figure out how

22 someone can conspire to obtain their own consent.  It

23 requires shifting perspectives as you navigate your way

24 through the statute.  And I think that our

25 interpretation is  is much more consistent with the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 way people would actually talk about this offense.

19

2             I mean, in some form 

3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about aiding and

4 abetting?  Could the brothers who own the body shop,

5 could they  could they be charged with aiding and

6 abetting

9             MR. DAVIS:  Justice Ginsburg, I don't think

10 that they could.  I think the same textual problem would

11 exist for aiding and abetting liability.  18 U.S.C. 2 is

12 the general aiding and abetting statute, and it leads

13 you straight back to the Hobbs Act in the same way that

14 the general conspiracy statute does.  So I don't  I

15 don't think so.

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it  is it extortion or

17 attempted extortion?  If two brothers, as here, try to

18 get money from a third party and the third party really

19 wants to give them the money  say, for example, he

20 wants to give them the money because he's going to

21 illustrate how awful the police are in that town.  Or he

22 gives them the money because he thinks it's funny.  Or

23 he gives them the money  is that extortion?

24             Because I'm having trouble distinguishing

25 between why it should be extortion but not conspiracy

1 for extortion, because that's what you're aiming at.

20

2 You're prepared to say, okay, it's extortion.  Well, if

3 it's extortion, you've heard all the arguments and why

4 can't these other people commit it and you're simply

5 helping them.  But is it extortion?

6             MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, this Court has

7 defined extortion in Evans to mean  to basically mean

8 when a public official takes a bribe, and, you know, we

9 take that holding as a given.

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  He takes a bribe, all

11 right?  Is it  is it a bribe when the person just

12 showers him with money, hoping for nothing illegal?

13             MR. DAVIS:  No.

14             JUSTICE BREYER:  He might think it's a

15 bribe, but  but is it?

16             MR. DAVIS:  Well, Your Honor, there has 

17             JUSTICE BREYER:  He voluntarily gives him

18 the money expecting joy and happiness.  I mean, you see,

19 that's where it seems to me the odd part of the case

20 lies.

21             MR. DAVIS:  Well, Your Honor, I think if he

22 just gave him  showered him with gifts not expecting

23 anything, it would not be extortion because there has to

24 be a quid pro quo.  The money has to be paid in return

25 for specific official acts.  So that would not be an act

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So if bribe,

3 then we're back  if bribery is extortion, then why

4 isn't conspiracy to commit bribery conspiracy to commit

5 extortion?  We're back where we began.  The odd thing is

6 in calling bribery extortion.  Once you cross that

7 bridge  that's where we started.  But we're back  in

8 my mind, it sort of got back where we started.  And

9 you're trying to drive a wedge there, and all your

10 arguments seem to be me, really, to be aimed at why are

11 we calling bribery extortion?

12             MR. DAVIS:  I don't 

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  Because they are showering

14 with money.  They love it.

15             MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, we're not taking

16 direct aim at Evans.  And I don't 

17             JUSTICE BREYER:  I know that, but, I mean,

18 how you're asking me to make that distinction, how do I

19 do it?

20             MR. DAVIS:  Well, Your Honor, I think Evans

21 dealt with a substantive offense, and this case deals

22 with conspiracy.  And when you overlay a conspiratorial

23 agreement on top of a substantive offense, it just stops

24 making sense grammatically to talk about the offense the

25 way the government does.

Alderson Reporting Company

22 1             Again, when two people reach an agreement 2 that one will pay the other one a bribe, it just  it 3 doesn't make sense of ordinary English to say that 4 they're agreeing to obtain property from someone else, 5 from another. 6             I also think  you know, I don't want the 7 phrase "with his consent" to get lost here also.  The 8 Hobbs Act punishes the obtaining of property with his  9 from another with his consent.  And as Judge Sutton 10 explained in  in the Brock decision, how can someone 11 conspire  how would or why  how could or why would 12 someone conspire to obtain their own consent?  So even 13 if you don't agree with us on the  on the "from 14 another" language, I think the "with his consent" 15 language does it as well. 16             And then the other textual point  17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, before  I 18 mean, the government says, of course, is there's  19 there's consent and there's consent, and they suggest 20 that there's a difference between consent and 21 conspiracy.  Right? 22             MR. DAVIS:  Right. 23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what's your 24 answer to that? 25             MR. DAVIS:  Well, we agree with that,
Alderson Reporting Company

23 1 Your Honor.  We think that there are plenty of instances 2 of consent under the Hobbs Act that would not be a 3 conspiratorial agreement.  But it's hard to see what 4 payment of a bribe would not be a conspiratorial 5 agreement under the government's theory.  Maybe there's 6 some narrow category of cases where the bribe pair is 7 just acquiescing to an official demand as it  8             JUSTICE BREYER:  And what payment of a bribe 9 is not extortion? 10             MR. DAVIS:  I  I agree, Your Honor.  I 11 think  12             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So the only 13 ground, then, we could say is say, well, they went just 14 up to the limit of the logic in the other case, and 15 we're just not going to be logical to extend it further. 16             MR. DAVIS:  I think  17             JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that  18             MR. DAVIS:  I don't think that's quite 19 right, Your Honor. 20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Works for me. 21             (Laughter.) 22             MR. DAVIS:  I  I think that is a ground, 23 Your Honor.  I don't think it's the only ground. 24             I think the other ground would be the plain 25 text of the statute.  I mean, Evans  in Evans, the 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
24 1 the government didn't have the same textual problem that 2 it has in this case.  The government didn't have to 3 grapple with the "from another" language.  And in this 4 case, "from another" most naturally means someone 5 outside the  the conspiracy. 6             The other point  textual point I'd like 7 to  8             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Davis, if you could go 9 back to what you just said about the consent.  I mean, 10 look, I mean, Evans makes perfectly clear that bribes 11 and kickbacks are included in this statute.  And  and 12 there is a difference between  there  there are 13 cases in which somebody participates in a kickback 14 scheme and does not consent. 15             I mean, suppose some public official comes 16 in and says, in order for me to give you a license to do 17 something, to be, you know, a member of some profession, 18 let's say a cosmetologist, you need to pay me $20 as a 19 kickback.  And the person, you know, pays him $20 20 because you've got to get your license.  But there's no 21 way in the world in which that would count as a 22 conspiratorial agreement.  It would count as consent 23 under the Hobbs Act. 24             So there's a big gap between consent and a 25 conspiratorial agreement, even in the context of bribes.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
25 1             MR. DAVIS:  Justice Kagan, I don't disagree 2 with you, but with an asterisk.  I think there is a gray 3 area there where someone just acquiesces to an official 4 demand like you're saying.  Those may not be 5 conspiratorial agreements.  But I think still, there is 6 a large category of bribery cases that would  would 7 still be conspiratorial agreements under the 8 government's theory, anytime someone, like in Salinas, 9 pays a bribe in exchange for official action and wasn't 10 required to do so. 11             So I think still the government's theory 12 would render some of the language in 666 unnecessary. 13 You know, 18 U.S.C. 666 has specific monetary thresholds 14 put on when a bribe is a Federal crime.  And the  and 15 none of  the bribe has to be over $5,000.  The State 16 official has to work for an agency that receives $10,000 17 or more in Federal funds.  And I think in a lot of those 18 cases, the government could just avoid those limitations 19 by charging the case as a conspiracy to commit extortion 20 under the Hobbs Act. 21             And that's even though there may be a 22 category of cases that would not be a conspiratorial 23 agreement, but that would be consent under the Hobbs 24 Act. 25             On one more textual point, Your Honors, the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 statute also punishes whoever conspires to obtain

26

2 property from another, which, I think, reinforces our

3 reading that the "whoever" who obtains the property has

4 to be a different person from the "another" from whom

5 property is obtained.

6             And I think the general conspiracy statute

7 gets to the same place by just a slightly more

8 circuitous route.  It punishes each person who conspires

9 to commit any offense against the United States.

10             JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it fair to say that you

11 are advancing an argument that is limited to the precise

12 language of the Hobbs Act?  You  you are not taking

13 issue with the proposition that a person can conspire to

14 commit offense that the person could not personally

15 commit.  And you distinguish the Hobbs Act from the

16 Mann Act because one refers to "any" and another refers

17 to "another."

18             So is it fair to say that what you want is a

19 special conspiracy rule that applies only in cases of

20 Hobbs Act conspiracies?

21             MR. DAVIS:  No, Your Honor.  I think that

22 what we're asking for is just to apply the language of

23 the general conspiracy statute in light of the words

24 from another in the Hobbs Act.  And when you put the two

25 together 

Alderson Reporting Company

27 1             JUSTICE ALITO:  And if another substantive 2 offense doesn't have the word "obtain property from"  3 the phrase "obtain property from another," then your  4 your rule doesn't apply? 5             MR. DAVIS:  I think that's generally right, 6 Your Honor.  Our textual arguments would not apply.  I 7 think there would still be an issue of, you know, 8 there's a  there's a principle that when the 9 substantive offense requires the  necessarily requires 10 agreement, you're not supposed to add a conspiracy 11 charge on that, but that's just a presumption.  I think 12 you're right that our  our textual argument would 13 not  would not apply in the absence of the words 14 "another," "with his consent," and "whoever." 15             I'd like  if there are no further 16 questions, I'd like to reserve my time for rebuttal. 17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 18             Mr. Kedem. 19               ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM 20                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 21             MR. KEDEM:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 22 please the Court: 23             A conspiracy is an agreement to commit an 24 offense against the United States, that is, a joint 25 commitment to a plan that, if completed, would satisfy
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
28 1 all elements of the substantive offense.  And while all 2 conspirators must agree on that goal, no particular 3 member of the conspiracy must agree that he, himself, 4 will commit all or even any of the substantive elements 5 of the offense. 6             And so you don't ask whether all 7 conspirators or the conspiracy as a whole agreed to 8 obtain property from another any more than you would ask 9 whether the conspiracy as a whole acted under color of 10 official right. 11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do  do you agree that 12 under your approach, every private individual who seeks 13 to bribe a State official is liable for conspiracy to 14 commit Hobbs Act extortion? 15             MR. KEDEM:  We don't.  And that's because of 16 active participation. 17             Let me explain where that comes from and 18 then how it applies to this case. 19             Holte and Gebardi concerned the Mann Act, 20 which prohibited the transportation of a woman across 21 State lines for immoral purposes.  And the question was 22 whether a woman who was transported could conspire to 23 violate the Act. 24             In answering that question, the Court 25 focused on two things.  First of all, although the Act
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
29 1 contemplates the involvement of the woman, it doesn't 2 impose substantive criminal liability on her.  And, 3 second, some minimal form of agreement is an inherent 4 feature of most instances of the offense. 5             Based on those two factors, the Court said, 6 if that's all there is, if the only thing that the woman 7 agrees to is to the transportation itself, that is, the 8 bare outlines of the crime, that by itself would be 9 insufficient to make her a conspirator.  But if she were 10 to agree to do more  if, for instance, she were to 11 purchase the tickets or to arrange the transportation in 12 some other way  then she could be a conspirator. 13             And so in this case, with respect to a bribe 14 pair, if all the bribe pair agrees to do is turn over 15 money in return for official acts, that by itself would 16 be insufficient to make the bribe pair a conspirator. 17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, suppose he arranges 18 to meet on the park bench at 2:00 o'clock, and has a 19 followup call to the official to please be there.  Is 20 that  does that suffice? 21             MR. KEDEM:  I think that would be incidental 22 to the one thing that they're really agreeing to do, 23 which is to turn over the money. 24             But contrast that with what happened in this 25 case.  Because Moreno and Mejia didn't just hand over an
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
30 1 envelope with $100 bills in it.  They worked closely in 2 conjunction with police officers, including Petitioner. 3             For instance, when Petitioner went to the 4 scene of an accident, he would call Moreno, and they 5 would talk about what cars were involved:  The make, 6 model, the year, what extent of damage was involved. 7 And then Moreno would consult with Petitioner about 8 which cars would be most lucrative to have in the shop. 9             And so it wasn't simply a case of agreeing 10 to the bare outlines of the crime.  He agreed to 11 facilitate it in additional ways. 12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you charge that 13 to a jury? 14             MR. KEDEM:  Pardon? 15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you charge it to 16 a jury? 17             MR. KEDEM:  I think you would tell the jury 18 two things. 19             First, in order for a bribe pair to be a 20 conspirator, they have to agree to actively participate 21 in the plan. 22             And second  23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I mean, I'm a 24 juror and I say, I  police officer came to me, asked 25 me for 20 bucks, and he'll let me go for my ticket.  I'm

1 active participation.  That's what I'm thinking.

31

2             MR. KEDEM:  The second one is that you would

3 have to tell the jury that if all you've agreed to do is

4 to turn over money in return for official acts, then

5 that by itself is insufficient.

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  That's lovely.  And

7 that  you know, that prevents this law from  Federal

8 law from hitting anybody who pays a bribe, which is

9 certainly a desirable result.

10             But I don't see how it comports with your

11 theory of the case.  I mean, there is just as much of an

12 agreement between the two people to obtain money from

13 another, whether that other actively participates or

14 not.

15             Where  where do you get this active

16 participation requirement from?

17             MR. KEDEM:  Well 

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Except to make it up to

19 sweeten the deal, so that  so that we  we don't

20 extend this  this law too far.

21             MR. KEDEM:  Active participation comes from

22 Holte and Gebardi, and it's also notable that the

23 government didn't make up the requirement for purposes

24 of this case.  The First, Second, Fourth, and Fifth

25 Circuits have used active participation in the context

1 of Hobbs Act extortion

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And where did they get it

3 from?

4             MR. KEDEM:  They get it from 

5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And where did Holte and

6 Gebardi get it from?

7             MR. KEDEM:  I think Holte and Gebardi see it

8 as a gloss on the type of agreement that's necessary to

9 make a particular person a conspirator.

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's not what

11 conspiracy law says.  It's any agreement.  If  if you

12 agree, you're  you're liable to conspiracy.  Where 

13 where do  can  can you hang on this active  is

14 there an active participation requirement for other

15 conspiracies?

16             MR. KEDEM:  In this  in this Court's case

17 in Abuelhawa, which is cited at footnote 8 in our brief,

18 the Court also relied on Gebardi to raise the level of

19 facilitation that would be required for a drug purchaser

20 to be held liable for facilitating the sale of a drug.

21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I  I 

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where is the  the

23 active participation point in the jury instructions?

24             MR. KEDEM:  It's not in the jury

25 instructions because Petitioner never requested it,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
33 1 despite the fact that active participation was already 2 the law in the Fourth Circuit. 3             I would also point out that it was 4 Petitioner's argument that it simply doesn't matter how 5 actively a bribe pair facilitates the extortion. 6 Moreover, there was no dispute in this case that Moreno 7 and Mejia made an active role.  In fact, it was 8 Petitioner's contention at trial that they were, in 9 fact, the masterminds of this scheme. 10             Justice Scalia, if you don't like active 11 participation, then you would simply revert to the 12 common law standard in which agreeing to the outlines of 13 the crime would be sufficient, even if you were a bribe 14 pair. 15             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So if  16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That makes sense to me. 17             JUSTICE KAGAN:  If  if I could just 18 understand what you're saying, you think active 19 participation is more than an agreement along the 20 typical conspiracy lines. 21             MR. KEDEM:  I think normally agreeing to the 22 bare outlines of the crime would be sufficient for most 23 conspirators.  I think  24             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would  would? 25             MR.

34 1             But I think active participation is a way to 2 raise the threshold  3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  But  4             MR. KEDEM:   certain types of crimes. 5             JUSTICE KAGAN:   this does sound more like 6 an aiding and abetting standard than it does a 7 conspiracy standard, because typically in conspiracy we 8 say it doesn't really matter if you actively 9 participate, as long as you reach an agreement. 10             MR. KEDEM:  I  11             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now that agreement is more 12 than acquiescence, right?  It's more than I reluctantly 13 give you the bribe that you're demanding of me. 14             MR. KEDEM:  That's right. 15             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But  but I guess I'm with 16 Justice Scalia that I don't really quite understand how 17 to get from the typical real agreement that we require 18 in conspiracy cases to some higher standard with respect 19 to this crime of active participation. 20             MR. KEDEM:  I think it's a gloss on what you 21 have to agree to do in order to be considered a 22 conspirator.  So it's true that the agreement itself is 23 what's criminal when it comes to a conspiracy, whereas 24 with aiding and abetting, it's acts.  And I think it's a 25 similar inquiry.  With aiding and abetting, you act

2 And with conspiracy, you ask:  Did you agree to actively

4             If I could attack  if I could refer to my

5 friend's argument about unity of purpose, he's correct

6 that there does need to be a unity of purpose, but he's

7 incorrect as to what that purpose needs to be.

8             Under Salinas, all members of the conspiracy

9 must agree on a plan that is an offense against the

10 United States; that is, an offense, a plan that, if

11 completed, would satisfy all elements of the substantive

12 offense.

13             And Petitioner says Evans was the highwater

14 mark in interpreting the Hobbs Act.  But the 

15             JUSTICE BREYER:  The  the answer, as I

16 understand this now, the purpose of this active

17 participation doctrine is let's look at the substantive

18 offense.  And all of a sudden we're saying every

19 policeman, every State official, everyone in the country

20 who goes to any person and says, give me some money for

21 my position, they're already guilty.  That already is

22 extortion on this case that we've been talking about

23 before, right?

24             MR. KEDEM:  That's right.

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.

1             MR. KEDEM:  But 

36

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  So now what you're going to

3 do is you're going to make not only them guilty of the

4 Federal crime, you're going to make anybody who pays

5 them guilty of the Federal crime.  That's the purpose of

6 this case.

7             Now you say don't worry about it, because

8 there's situation A and situation B.

9             In situation A, the policeman is the heavy,

10 and all the victim's done is stop at the traffic light.

11 He says, give me the money, and that's a bribe, all

12 right?  He's a bad guy, the policeman; the victim is not

13 so bad.

14             But in the other case, the victim says, I

15 love it, like these people, because we're really getting

16 money from the public.  That's what they're trying to

17 do  who are the real victims here, but they're not 

18 that's not charged that way.

19             And that's what the active participation

20 thing is designed to do, separate the  the sort of

21 innocent victims who aren't policemen from the

22 cooperating victims who love the policemen to take the

23 money because they want the result; is that right?

KEDEM:  That's  4             JUSTICE BREYER:  The argument on his side is 5 don't make a bad situation worse. 6             MR. KEDEM:  Well  7             JUSTICE BREYER:  We already are federalizing 8 vast numbers of State crimes, which really are the 9 States' business.  And now you're not necessarily 10 doubling the number, but you're increasing it by about 11 80 percent.  Now that  that's what I've got as a 12 practical argument that he's making.  And  and your 13 answer to that is, don't worry it's not your business. 14 It's just follow the logic. 15             MR. KEDEM:  I think under active 16 participation, you wouldn't be doing that. 17             JUSTICE BREYER:  I understand. 18             MR. KEDEM:  I would also point  19             JUSTICE BREYER:  What I'm interested in is 20 if I understand it correctly. 21             MR. KEDEM:  I think you do, Your Honor. 22             I would also point out that the argument he 23 makes with regard to "from another" has nothing in 24 particular to do with the Hobbs Act.  It would apply any 25 time a statute uses phrases like "from another" or "to

1 another."  And let me give you an example.

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, before you do,

3 I'm still stuck on the jury instructions.  You cite in

4 your brief language on Joint Appendix page 195 where the

5 judge says  I think these are the instructions.  Maybe

6 I'm wrong, but you cite them, where the judge says mere

7 knowledge or acquiescence without participation in the

8 unlawful plan is not sufficient.

9             Is that  that's the language, I take it,

10 you're talking about with 

11             MR. KEDEM:  That's 

12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   "the jury was

13 instructed."

14             MR. KEDEM:  That was given  given the

15 jury, but I think that's the standard conspiracy

16 instruction.

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, on page 194,

18 it says, "The extent of a defendant's participation has

19 no bearing on the issue of his guilt."  And I just

20 wondered whether your  it's active participation.

21 That suggests to me something that goes to the extent of

22 the defendant's participation.

23             MR. KEDEM:  That's right.  A different

24 instruction would be given, but it's important to

25 emphasize that Petitioner did not appeal the failure to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 give a specific jury instruction.  He didn't request

39

2 one, and that was not the basis for appeal.  He had a

3 sufficiency of the evidence challenge on appeal, and

4 that's what's before this Court.

5             Moreover, there is overwhelming evidence

6 that Moreno and Mejia did, in fact, actively

7 participate.  In fact, that was Petitioner's very theory

8 at trial.

9             But let me give you an example of how

10 Petitioner's argument with regard to "from another" does

11 not necessarily only focus on the Hobbs Act.  Imagine

12 the for instance, there was a statute that said if you

13 steal from a bank while pointing a gun at another, it's

14 aggravated bank robbery.  And imagine a robber says to

15 his friend, you go into the bank ahead of me.  I'll run

16 in, point a gun at your head, and say, cashier give me

17 all of your money.

18             According to Petitioner, that would not be

19 conspiracy, because judged  from the perspective of

20 the conspiracy as a whole, no gun was pointed at

21 another.  And at base, Petitioner's argument is that

22 every element of the substantive offense has to be

23 judged in a conspiracy from the perspective of the

24 conspiracy as a single, undifferentiated whole.

25             A couple responses to that.  First of all,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
40 1 it's not even clear what that means; for instance, how 2 it could be that a conspiracy as a whole obtains 3 property under color of official right. 4             Second of all, it contradicts the very 5 premise behind conspiracy liability, which is that 6 different members of the conspiracy agree to play 7 different roles, and it's only when you add those 8 various roles together that you get the completed 9 offense. 10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm afraid you haven't 11 scared me.  I don't  I don't think that in the 12 situation you posit where  where the  the two gunmen 13 say you come into the bank with me and I'll point the 14 gun at your head and say, what, unless you cough up the 15 money, I'm going to shoot my friend.  I don't see why 16 that would be a conspiracy  17             MR. KEDEM:  I don't  18             JUSTICE SCALIA:   to point a gun at 19 another. 20             MR. KEDEM:  I don't think, Justice Scalia, 21 you would say, give me the money or I'll kill my friend. 22 I think the friend would pretend to be a customer in the 23 bank. 24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sure.  But  well  25             MR. KEDEM:  And I think the two of them
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
41 1 would have formed the plan in order to accomplish the 2 aggravated robbery. 3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I would not think that 4 that's a conspiracy to point a gun at another. 5             MR. KEDEM:  Well, Justice  6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a conspiracy to point 7 a gun between themselves. 8             MR. KEDEM:  Justice Scalia, I think that 9 only is true if you judge each element of the offense  10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I understand  11             MR. KEDEM:   with regard to the 12 conspiracy. 13             JUSTICE SCALIA:   but you were trying to 14 present a clear example. 15             MR. KEDEM:  Sure. 16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it doesn't seem to me 17 very clear at all. 18             MR. KEDEM:  Justice Scalia, we cite about a 19 half dozen other Federal statutes that also similarly 20 use phrases like "from another" and "to another" that 21 would be similarly affected by Petitioner's argument. 22             I would also like to  23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the other reason your 24 hypothetical doesn't work too well is we know that he's 25 not going to pull the gun because he's his friend, but
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 in this case the money is going to be given.  So it

42

2 doesn't work.

3             MR. KEDEM:  Well, Justice Kennedy, I would

4 point you then to the statute that we cite that talks

5 about someone who is a government official who receives

6 coded, secret information from another and provides it

7 to another.  Petitioner's only response is there may be

8 some other statute that you could prosecute under in the

9 case in which the "from another" and "to another" are

10 both officials of other governments.  But what if there

11 are not?  What if they're officials  what if they're

12 members of a terrorist organization, for instance?

13             I'd like to also address my friend's

14 argument with respect to the word "whoever" in

15 Subsection A.  I don't think it works for a couple

16 reasons.

17             First of all, the word "whoever" in

18 Subsection A  and this is best addressed if looking

19 directly at the words of the statute at page 2a to the

20 appendix to our brief.  "Whoever," in Subsection (a), is

21 not the subject of the phrase "obtaining of property

22 from another" in Subsection (b)(2).  If it were, then no

23 private citizen could ever be member of a conspiracy

24 because no private citizen can obtain property from

25 another under color of official right.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
43 1             Instead, the word "whoever" is the subject 2 of the phrase "obstructs, delays, or affects commerce" 3 by extortion or agrees or conspires so to do.  And to 4 give you an example of how that can be affected, even if 5 you yourself are not the person who commits the 6 extortion, imagine a case of robbery in which there is a 7 central organizer who brings together robbers who have 8 various skills and gives them a plan but doesn't himself 9 intend to participate in the robbery.  In that case, he 10 would have conspired to obstruct, delay, or affect 11 commerce by robbery, even though he himself would not be 12 committing robbery. 13             And the same is true with respect to 14 extortion.  Moreno and Mejia were part of a plan which 15 they actively facilitated that obstructed, delayed, and 16 affected commerce by extortion. 17             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, is it  if  18 what  I'm still  a crime requires that the victim 19 give consent.  Now, what kind of  it could be 20 obtaining consent to do something.  Smith obtains 21 consent to do something.  The victim agrees with Smith 22 to participate in that crime.  But in agreeing to do it, 23 he is giving consent.  So from that point on, there is 24 no further consent to be given.  So it's like robbing 25 the pocket of a stone idol or some  what used to be
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 called in law school  once the consent is given.

44

2             So maybe he is agreeing to participate in a

3 conspiracy to attempt to get the consent.  But he's

4 agreeing to the  he gives the consent at the moment he

5 agrees.

6             MR. KEDEM:  Justice Breyer 

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  So how can you be

8 conspiring to  to do something to get a consent that

9 was already given?

10             MR. KEDEM:  Justice Breyer 

11             JUSTICE BREYER:  You could conspire to

12 attempt to get it, but not to get it, if you're being

13 really picky on these words.

14             MR. KEDEM:  The issue of consent is really a

15 red herring in this case, because as my friend just

16 stated, consent from the common law for extortion falls

17 well below the meeting of the minds that you would need

18 for conspiratorial agreement.  And that much is made

19 clear by the fact that even in cases of coercive

20 extortion, that is extortion induced by wrongful use of

21 actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, you would

22 still need consent.

23             And so the type of agreement that we're

24 talking about, with or without the active participation

25 requirement, is well above the threshold for consent

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 under the common law.

45

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You haven't talked

3 about Majestic yet, and your friend said that's maybe

4 because you had never raised that below.  Is that  is

5 that true?  In other words, the Majestic is the other

6 from which the funds are going to be obtained?

7             MR. KEDEM:  That's not accurate.  It was

8 raised in the trial court.  The trial court made a

9 ruling that Majestic was also another, and the court of

10 appeals decided not to adopt that argument.  We haven't

11 pursued it in this Court.

12             I would also point out 

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Was that just  was

14 that in your brief in opposition to certiorari?

15             MR. KEDEM:  We talked about the fact that in

16 this case you could look at Majestic as another, and we

17 talked about that in the context of the Brock case out

18 of the Sixth Circuit, but we're not 

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is Majestic a sole

20 proprietorship?

21             MR. KEDEM:  It started out as an LLC, but

22 became a corporation, as cited in footnote 1 of our

23 brief.

24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Was it indicted as part

25 of this crime?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1             MR. KEDEM:  It wasn't indicted, but it was 2 in the indictment stated that money came from Majestic. 3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You do say in your brief 4 that if we adopt the Petitioner's argument, that 5 basically you would never have any cases.  But I'm not 6 sure that's right.  For example, the most common 7 situation is the New York City permitting official. 8 Generally, they agree with developers to have 9 contractors pay them a bribe to expedite their work. 10 That, you could prosecute because two people are 11 agreeing to get money from another, the contractors. 12 Those situations are not so unusual. 13             MR. KEDEM:  I don't  14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think, as one of my 15 colleagues said, there was a conspiracy here to get 16 money from the victims. 17             MR. KEDEM:  I don't think, Justice 18 Sotomayor, that our argument is you would never have 19 instances in which the conspiracy provision would apply. 20 I think what we're saying is, this is precisely the type 21 of scenario in which conspiracy liability should attach. 22 And I think there may be a sense by some that clever 23 prosecutors, maybe in some cases, are pushing the bounds 24 of conspiracy law beyond where they're  traditionally 25 have gone, and using it in ways that perhaps are not
Alderson Reporting Company

1 warranted.

Official

47

2             Whatever the merits of that criticism as a

3 general matter, this is not that case.  The criminal

4 conspiracy in this case was a durable, multifaceted,

5 criminal enterprise that had a division of labor and

6 succeeded over the course of several years in committing

7 not only numerous acts of extortion, but other forms of

8 illegality as well.

9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  You had no other substantive

10 crime to charge against the brothers?

11             MR. KEDEM:  The brothers also pled guilty to

12 aiding and abetting extortion which, under Petitioner's

13 theory, would not have been possible.

14             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why didn't you just charge

15 them with getting money from the customers?  I mean,

16 that's who  they're conspiring  after all, they're

17 giving $150 to the policeman.  They aren't

18 philanthropists.  They think they're going to get that

19 money back from the people whose cars are wrecked.

20             MR. KEDEM:  That's correct.  They could

21 also 

22             JUSTICE BREYER:  So those are the other

23 people.  I mean, this is really a conspiracy on behalf

24 of the policeman and the  and the owner of the repair

25 shop to get money from a customer, a person whose car

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 was wrecked.  That's why they do it; isn't it?

48

2             MR. KEDEM:  That is true, Justice Breyer,

3 but they didn't necessarily commit a crime against the

4 customer if all they did is repair the customer's car.

5 Now, they did also commit various forms of insurance

6 fraud, but put that to the side.

7             In this scheme, if all they did was get

8 money from a customer and fix the car as promised, then

9 they would not have committed a crime necessarily

10 against the customer.

11             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And, indeed, isn't it right

12 that what Justice Breyer is saying was the very theory

13 behind Evans, why this was extortion, is because the

14 real crime was to the public at large, not to any

15 particular customer.  But yes, there was a crime to

16 the  the general public.

17             MR. KEDEM:  That's correct.  The victim in

18 cases of extortion is not necessarily the person who

19 pays the bribe, who might do so willingly and might do

20 so in order to get something from the public official.

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the Federal

22 government's interest in this case, right, the

23 reason is  is, what?

24             MR. KEDEM:  Well, Justice Scalia 

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That automobiles are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 instruments of interstate commerce?

49

2             MR. KEDEM:  Justice Scalia, I think Evans

3 settled that the mere receipt of a bribe in return for

4 performing officials acts is, in fact, extortion.  And I

5 don't think that's at issue here.

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, oh, it doesn't have to

7 be any  any Federal constitutional authority, just 

8             MR. KEDEM:  There does have the to be

9 constitutional authority.

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, what is it?  I mean,

11 here, it is  I assume that it's automobiles.

12             MR. KEDEM:  That's  well, Justice Scalia,

13 it's affecting commerce and there was evidence at trial

14 that, for instance, insurance payments came from out of

15 State.  And that was specifically used to  to show the

16 affecting commerce element.

17             I would also point out that if you were

18 simply to charge Petitioner with three isolated

19 instances of extortion, of the substantive act of

20 extortion, it would not reflect the full range of his

21 misconduct because, again, he didn't simply receive

22 money and then refer cars for it.  He worked closely in

23 conjunction with Moreno and Mejia.

24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You  you agree

25 with your friend's point, though, that charging the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 conspiracy gives the prosecutor considerably broader

50

2 range in the evidence that he wants to admit at trial?

3             MR. KEDEM:  I think that that does sometimes

4 happen, but that's a general principle that has no

5 specific relation to the argument that Petitioner is

6 making in this case.

7             JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the relationship

8 between that argument and the question of whether

9 there's a conspiracy between Ocasio and Moreno and

10 Mejia?  It might apply to the conspiracy between  the

11 alleged conspiracy between Ocasio and the other police

12 officers because it  although it could allow the 

13 make it easier to admit evidence of what the other

14 police officers did.

15             MR. KEDEM:  That's right.

16             JUSTICE ALITO:  But what  it has no 

17 whether or not there was a conspiracy between Ocasio and

18 Moreno and Mejia doesn't seem to me to have anything 

19 anything to do with what evidence would be admissible at

20 trial.

21             MR. KEDEM:  That's right, Justice Alito.

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought you

23 told me that was wrong.  I thought you told me you

24 agreed with your friend that it gives broader scope to

25 the range of evidence that could be admitted beyond

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 charging simply the substantive offense.

51

2             MR. KEDEM:  It does  it does,

3 Mr. Chief Justice, but that would still have been true

4 even if Moreno and Mejia were not charged as

5 coconspirators because there was voluminous evidence 

6 and we cited in the last portion of our brief  that

7 Petitioner conspired with other police officers as well.

8 For instance, he was recruited into the scheme by

9 another police officer, probably Officer Rodriguez, who

10 was indicted along with him.

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you  do you

12 agree that the most that that gets you is a remand to

13 address the Skilling question?

14             MR. KEDEM:  We don't.  We don't.  Skilling

15 was an issue about jury instructions.  And, again,

16 Petitioner's challenge in the court of appeals as it 

17 and as it comes to this Court is not about the jury

18 instructions.

19             I would point you instead to Griffin v.

20 United States, 502 U.S. 46, which talks about

21 sufficiency challenges, which is what this is.

22             And if you look at that evidence, not only

23 was Petitioner recruited by other officers, he himself

24 tried to recruit other officers into this scene.  For

25 instance, trying to set up his own referral network.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             Moreover, there was evidence that he and

52

2 Officer Rodriguez worked together on at least one

3 occasion to bring a car into Majestic.

4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And  and is it a

5 sufficiency  I would have thought it's a statutory

6 interpretation challenge and not simply a sufficiency of

7 the evidence challenge.

8             MR. KEDEM:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't

9 think there was a specific instruction to the jury one

10 way or another about whether they either could or

11 couldn't find it just based on Moreno and Mejia.  And as

12 a result, because there was a general verdict, you don't

13 know specifically whether the jury relied on Moreno and

14 Mejia alone or whether they also relied on other

15 officers.

16             And under that circumstance, I think Griffin

17 says it's a  just a general sufficiency challenge.

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, on that I

19 guess your  your friend says that the whole thrust of

20 the case you presented was based on the conspiracy

21 between the two brothers and the officer rather than the

22 spokes, I guess is the jargon, involving the different

23 officers with Ocasio.  Is that true?

24             MR. KEDEM:  We don't think that's true.  I

25 would refer you to all of the evidence we cite in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 last section of our brief.  This was the way it was

53

2 indicted.  The indictment itself said that Petitioner

3 conspired with other officers.

4             It was also specifically cited in the

5 closing argument to the jury, that they were able to

6 find that he had conspired with other officers.  And

7 there was a great deal of evidence that he did so.

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that just harmless

9 error, assuming we agree with your  your  with the

10 Petitioner and say the other has to be somebody else?

11             MR. KEDEM:  We don't think that it's

12 harmless error, but I do take your point that it's an

13 alternative grounds for holding for the government.

14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you think it's

15 sufficiency?

16             MR. KEDEM:  I do.  I think that's what

17 Griffin v. United States says.

18             If there are no further questions.

19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

21            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ETHAN P. DAVIS

22               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

23             MR. DAVIS:  Thank you.  I'll start with my

24 friend's Griffin point.  We directly challenged the jury

25 instructions in our brief in this Court and the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
54 1 government did not raise any sort of argument that this 2 was just a sufficiency case there, so I think that is 3 water under the bridge.  But  4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But did you challenge the 5 instructions in the district court as well? 6             MR. DAVIS:  We challenged the jury 7 instructions in the district court, yes, Your Honor. 8 There was an objection raised to the government's 9 proposed instructions there. 10             I'd like to turn to the active participant 11 standard.  We agree with Justice Scalia that the active 12 participant standard doesn't come from anything in the 13 statute or anything in basic principles of conspiracy 14 law.  Conspiracy just requires an agreement and 15 sometimes an overt act, and this active participant 16 standard doesn't map on well to that at all. 17             The government  the cases that the 18 government cites that supposedly apply, Holte and 19 Gebardi to  to Hobbs Act prosecutions really dealt 20 with aiding and abetting, not with conspiracy.  And it's 21 much easier to see how the active participant standard 22 applies in the context of aiding and abetting, which 23 requires acts beyond mere agreement. 24             But in the context of conspiracy, the only 25 court really to have applied the active participant

Official
55 1 standard to conspiracy in any, in any significant way 2 was the Fourth Circuit in the Spitler decision. 3             JUSTICE BREYER:  Will you, in your answer, 4 get to what I think is the main point; the main point 5 being, look, two policemen and a shop owner.  The 6 policemen say, give us money and we'll help you out 7 later.  That's extortion.  All right. 8             If that's extortion, then why isn't it 9 conspiracy when, three weeks before they meet and bit by 10 bit say, we will do that very thing which is 11 extortion  12             MR. DAVIS:  I think  13             JUSTICE BREYER:   the shopkeeper is 14 helping the policemen do what is the thing that counts 15 as extortion and, therefore, he's conspired with them. 16 That's their very simple argument.  A simple answer is? 17             MR. DAVIS:  The simple answer is that's not 18 consistent with how  with ordinary English, Your 19 Honor.  When two people  when the repair shop owners 20 go to the public official and say, I'd like to help you 21 obtain property from another  22             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  The "other"  23 "another" means another other than the two policemen. 24             MR. DAVIS:  Only if  25             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's  that's what this

56 1 other case says.  And the law says that it's another  2 another other than them. 3             MR. DAVIS:  I think the only way the 4 government can make that sound plausible is by adding 5 words to the statute  6             JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no words.  Another. 7 Another.  Joe and Bill are the policemen; Sam is the 8 shopkeeper.  In the substantive crime, the other, 9 another, means not the two policemen; it means Sam.  And 10 Sam, two weeks earlier, helped and conspired with the 11 two policemen to get money from another; namely, Sam. 12             MR. DAVIS:  And  13             JUSTICE BREYER:  Odd, but English. 14             MR. DAVIS:  Justice Breyer, I think the 15 words "namely Sam" are doing all the work there.  If you 16 cut out the words "namely Sam," all of a sudden it 17 doesn't make sense anymore.  If he goes to the police 18 officers and says, let me help you obtain property from 19 another, you need to add words to the statute in order 20 for that to make sense. 21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Davis, I don't think you 22 need to add words.  What you need is to shift 23 perspective.  There is a difference here, but that's the 24 difference, that the government is insisting that you 25 look at it from the perspective of the person who, in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
57 1 this case, is doing the acts of obtaining property from 2 another.  And you are insisting that it be looked at 3 from the perspective of the person who has agreed to 4 help him do that. 5             But there's no reason under standard 6 conspiracy law that we would use the perspective of the 7 agreer rather than the perspective of the perpetrator. 8             MR. DAVIS:  Justice Kagan, with respect, I 9 don't agree with that.  I think that under standard 10 conspiracy law, you look at the perspective of both. 11 You have to have a unity of purpose with each 12 conspirator to do the same thing. 13             JUSTICE KAGAN:  There absolutely is a unity 14 of purpose, that one person should do the crime. 15             MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor  16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Go ahead. 17             MR. DAVIS:  With the unity of  there 18 may  that obscures the words "from another" from the 19 statute.  There may be a unity of purpose that they all 20 do something, but it begs the question about whether the 21 something that they're doing violates every element of 22 the offense. 23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 24             The case is submitted. 25             (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the
