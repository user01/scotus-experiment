3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 this morning in Case 14181, Gobeille v. Liberty Mutual

5 Insurance Company.

6             Ms. Asay.

7             ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIDGET C. ASAY

8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9             MS. ASAY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

11             Under  under the principles this Court

12 adopted in Travelers, Vermont's collection of health

13 care data is not preempted.  The database statute does

14 not affect ERISA plans in any way that undermines

15 ERISA's core objectives, does not require plans to offer

16 benefits, affect the financing or fiduciary standards

17 for plans, or change the way the plans administer

18 benefits to their members.

19             Vermont is merely collecting standardized

20 data that Blue Cross necessarily generates and already

21 provides to the State for itself and other entities.

22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it hasn't been argued

23 by Liberty, and we can ask them about that, that this is

24 burdensome, that it might be different from State to

25 State and so forth, and it may be that this sounds more

Alderson Reporting Company

4 1 in conflict preemption than statutory preemption.  But 2 can you just answer a few questions? 3             Does this apply to people that are not 4 residents in Vermont but that have been treated in 5 Vermont? 6             And does it also apply to people that are 7 outside of  that are Vermonters but are treated 8 outside Vermont? 9             I mean, what  who is the universe to whom 10 these  this applies? 11             And it seems to me that that would be 12 difficult for plans to  to figure out. 13             MS. ASAY:  As implemented by the board, Your 14 Honor, the  the database requirements apply to 15 Vermonters receiving health care services from a covered 16 insurer regardless of their location, so both inside 17 Vermont and outside Vermont, if it's paid for by a 18 covered insurer.  It does not  the board has chosen 19 not to require data from nonVermont residents receiving 20 care in Vermont. 21             With respect to the  to the burden and 22 with respect to the burden issue  23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say it's chosen to. 24 Does the statute authorize it to? 25             MS. ASAY:  The statute authorizes it to do

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  We  we  we ought to

3 consider that, don't you think?

4             MS. ASAY:  I don't  I don't believe so,

5 Your Honor, because the  the program that has been

6 challenged here by Liberty Mutual is the program as it

7 has been implemented by the board, and that  that is

8 how it has been implemented.

9             And this kind of generally applicable health

10 care regulation is not preempted for the reasons that

11 this Court has expressed in a series of decisions,

12 including Travelers, De Buono, Mackey, and Dillingham.

13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What of the point that

14 Justice Kennedy suggested, that  that States can have

15 different reporting requirements?  So it's a little bit

16 like Egelhoff in that respect, that if there were

17 uniform requirements, that would be less burdensome, but

18 if each State has its own specifications, then that

19 becomes burdensome and costly.

20             MS. ASAY:  Your Honor, two responses to

21 that.  The first is that there is simply no evidence in

22 this record that there is any cognizable burden on the

23 thirdparty administrators who are health care insurers

24 who generate this data and are providing it already in

25 their capacity as insurers.

6 1             Second, certainly some States may choose to 2 do these programs differently, but as several of the 3 amicus briefs explain, including the brief from the 4 National Association of Health Data Organizations, these 5 are carefully designed programs that track the 6 electronic transaction rule under HIPAA that provides 7 national standards for electronic claims transactions. 8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose States had 9 different reporting requirements and the plan showed  10 they haven't  I don't think showed, but suppose they 11 showed that this was burdensome.  Does that affect the 12 analysis of the preemption question? 13             MS. ASAY:  Only in this way, Your Honor:  I 14 think that the Court's holding in Travelers can be 15 distilled to basically three questions.  The first 16 question is: 17             Does the plan  does the State law 18 specifically and directly regulate ERISA plans only? 19 That's not at issue in this case.  It does not. 20             The second question is whether the State is 21 regulating in an area that Congress reserved to the 22 States or is regulating in an area with which ERISA is 23 principally concerned.  And here the State is engaging 24 in classic health care regulation, so on that question 25 the answer is no.

1             And then Travelers leaves open

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  You could say

3 that it's engaged in health care regulation.  You could

4 also say it's  it is engaged in data collection.  And

5 if you say the latter, that is something that  that

6 ERISA covers.

7             MS. ASAY:  Your Honor, ERISA governs plan

8 financial reporting and plan disclosures to the members.

9 It  primarily the reporting requirements that ERISA

10 sets out are about the plan finances:  actuarial

11 statements, statements of audited financial statements,

12 information about how the plan is  about the  the

13 degree of the plan's financial soundness.  And nothing

14 that Vermont is doing has anything to do 

15             JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that still true 

16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well 

17             JUSTICE ALITO:   after the Affordable Care

18 Act?  Doesn't the Affordable Care Act include in ERISA a

19 section authorizing the Secretary to gather information

20 from plans for the purpose of improving health outcomes?

21             MS. ASAY:  Yes.  The Affordable Care Act

22 made a technical amendment to ERISA, which in turn

23 incorporated the Act's amendments to the Public Health

24 Services Act.  Those do not change the test for ERISA

25 preemption.  They're not part of the plan's annual

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 reporting to the Department of Labor.

8

2             There's a couple of reasons for that.  One

3 is that the Affordable Care Act itself has a  has a 

4 an  almost an antipreemption provision, a provision

5 that says that the Affordable Care Act only prevents

6 those State laws that prevent the application of the

7 Act.

8             Part 7 of ERISA also, which has those

9 amendments in it, is not part of ERISA as it was

10 originally passed.  That was added by HIPAA.  And Part 7

11 itself has a provision that says it does not 

12             JUSTICE ALITO:  But why does it matter 

13             MS. ASAY:   affect the 

14             JUSTICE ALITO:   why does it matter

15 whether it was in ERISA as originally passed?  It is in

16 ERISA now.  And it is true that there is sort of an

17 antipreemption provision, but there is also a provision

18 in the Affordable Care Act that says that the  the

19 provisions that are added have no effect on the ERISA

20 preemption provision.

21             MS. ASAY:  That's right, Your Honor.

22             JUSTICE ALITO:  So what do you make of that?

23             MS. ASAY:  What I make of that is that it

24 does not change the test for preemption either way.  And

25 when  when Congress passed the Affordable Care Act,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Travelers had been on the books for years.  The

9

2 standards set forth in Travelers, which reserved, to the

3 State's, health care regulation, was understood by  by

4 Traveler  was understood by Congress, and it was not

5 changed.

6             And this program that  that Vermont has

7 adopted is a classic health care regulation.  The

8 data 

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  It is health care

10 regulation.  Vermont also has laws that govern

11 fiduciaries.  So could they have a statute which says

12 all fiduciaries, including fiduciaries  ERISA

13 fiduciaries must report  fill out the following forms

14 about how they  how they invest their money.

15             Can they do that?

16             MS. ASAY:  They could  they could have a

17 standard for 

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no.  Can they do

19 just what I said?  Is  or is that preempted?

20             MS. ASAY:  It would be preempted 

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  Correct.

22             MS. ASAY:   as applied to the ERISA plan.

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, suppose, instead of

24 that, what they say is, what we would like is that all

25 fiduciaries of ERISA plans send us each month a report

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1 of all of the benefits under the retirement plan that 2 they have paid to any member. 3             Can they do that? 4             MS. ASAY:  Your Honor, I think the answer to 5 that probably depends on the area in which the State is 6 regulating. 7             JUSTICE BREYER:  So what they're doing is 8 they have their  their Secretary of Health and Human 9 Services that would like to know how wealthy or poor the 10 workers are.  So that's why they do it. 11             MS. ASAY:  I think that would prevent a very 12 close question. 13             JUSTICE BREYER:  You think that's a close 14 question? 15             MS. ASAY:  That is a close question. 16             JUSTICE BREYER:  In other words, they can  17 gee, I see case after case here that says that reporting 18 requirements are a central function.  You know, I  19 you've read them just as well as I.  And  and it seems 20 to me surprising that they can do that. 21             Isn't that the job of the Labor Department. 22             MS. ASAY:  I think that is primarily the job 23 of the Labor Department.  And I  I say that it  24             JUSTICE BREYER:  Because obviously, my 25 question  it's a good answer, because you're saying
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
11 1 I'm not getting anywhere with this line of  because 2 you're  because I'm going to say what about health 3 care.  That's the next question. 4             My actual question I'm driving at is this: 5 You should have the information.  I have no doubt about 6 that.  But the question is whether you have to go to the 7 Labor Department first or HHS and say, we want uniform 8 rules here, or whether they have to come to you when the 9 rules of 50 States turn out to be a mess. 10             And you  you  you say you want to go 11 first and let them come after me, and I think the other 12 side says no.  If you want to do what you want to do, go 13 to the Labor Department, get a national rule that gives 14 you large range to get what you want. 15             MS. ASAY:  And  16             JUSTICE BREYER:  And I don't know the answer 17 to that question.  That's why I ask it. 18             MS. ASAY:  And, Your Honor, the answer to 19 that question is that, because this is classic health 20 care regulation for which States are responsible  21 insurance rate review, budget review, health care 22 research  it is an area in which States are permitted 23 to regulate.  And they're permitted to regulate even 24 slightly differently from State to State. 25             And as the Department of Labor, the Federal
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 government agrees with us that this is an area that

12

2 ERISA leaves to the States, even though it involves data

3 collection, because ERISA cannot possibly have been

4 intended to sweep away all collection of information

5 from plans by States.  Congress adopted a deliberately

6 expansive definition of a welfare benefit plan and ERISA

7 that includes, not just the direct provision of medical

8 care, but also day care centers, apprenticeship

9 programs, prepaid legal services.  These are all areas

10 in which when plans would act, they would necessarily be

11 providing information to States.

12             JUSTICE ALITO:  I  I see that  I  I

13 see that argument as to ERISA as originally enacted, but

14 I am very troubled by the fact that it now authorizes

15 the collection of data for the purpose of improving

16 health outcomes  health care outcomes.  I  I don't

17 see how that  unless the antipreemption provision

18 saves the day, I don't see how that does not undermine

19 your principal argument, which is that ERISA may preempt

20 reporting of financial data and that sort of thing, but

21 it doesn't preempt the collection of data regarding

22 health care.

23             MS. ASAY:  Your Honor, the  the scope of

24 ERISA's preemption provision in 1144 is governed by what

25 Congress intended when it passed ERISA in 1974.  And the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
13 1 later amendments to ERISA regarding group health plans 2 include the language that says, "does not affect or 3 modify that standard."  And so this Court, when it is 4 considering the scope of the  of the areas that 5 Congress left to the States in 1974  6             JUSTICE ALITO:  I really don't see how that 7 can possibly be.  If Congress enacted an amendment 8 tomorrow that says one of the core purposes of ERISA is 9 to collect health care information, and here is a  10 here is the health care collecting requirement, you 11 would say, well, that's not preempted, because that 12 wasn't the purpose when they enacted the preemption 13 provision, originally. 14             MS. ASAY:  I would certainly say that was 15 not preempted if it was added to Part 7, which says that 16 Part 7 does not affect the test for ERISA preemption in 17 1144. 18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, saying it doesn't 19 affect the test is quite different from saying that  20 that  that nothing changes.  The test remains the 21 same, but now, that test is applied to collection, 22 which  which the Labor Department is itself 23 conducting, or is itself authorized to conduct.  That's 24 not changing the test.  It's simply  it's simply 25 changing the facts to which the test has been applied 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 or the law to which the test has been applied.

14

2             MS. ASAY:  It would change the test, Your

3 Honor, because if ERISA was now considered to have a

4 broader, expansive scope that intruded into health care,

5 that would change this Court's settled precedent in

6 Travelers and De Buono.  And again, Congress 

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that doesn't change

8 the test.  Our test would still be the same whether it's

9 a core function of ERISA or not, and  and it has made

10 it a core function of ERISA.

11             MS. ASAY:  It has not made it a core

12 function of ERISA.  It has  there were  it's the

13 Affordable Care Act's amendment to ERISA, and again,

14 there's also in addition to Part 7's preemption

15 language, there is the Affordable Care Act's

16 antipreemption language, and to think that when

17 Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, which

18 contemplated a robust FederalState partnership in

19 health experimentation, which included language that

20 authorized the Department of Health and Human Services

21 to provide Medicare 

22             JUSTICE BREYER:  But this is no problem for

23 you.  All you have to do is go to DOL or HHS.  The State

24 representative says, this is what we want to do, will

25 you please promulgate a regulation.   you can do it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
15 1 maybe in 90 days or 120 days  which says that this and 2 similar things are fine.  And in our opinion, it is 3 not  it is not preempted.  I think you could do that. 4 That's my opinion.  I may be the only one who thinks 5 that.  So I  I think it's just a question of which 6 forms you have to go through. 7             But if we take you and say, I'm going to ask 8  I'm really asking the government this question, 9 because I don't see why they're on your side, and 10 they'll have an answer to that.  See, I want to find 11 out.  But what I want to find out is this:  The factor I 12 saw was 93 million people have these plans.  And if 93 13 million people have these plans, there can be 50 States 14 with 50 different sets of regulations imposing a huge 15 financial burden upon health care. 16             And were that to happen, suddenly all the 17 people we're trying to help under this plan will find 18 themselves much worse off, and purely for bureaucratic 19 reasons.  If I take their side of it, I can have some 20 assurance that the purpose of Congress in these statutes 21 will be fulfilled, because there will not be 22 unnecessary, conflicting reporting requirements, which 23 sound like nothing, but they're very expensive to  to 24 actually implement. 25             Now, that's my basic problem.  The same

16 1 question for you, for the government, and for the other 2 side, but the other side will agree with the way I put 3 the question. 4             MS. ASAY:  And if I may try responding this 5 way, Your Honor.  The  the notion that it's more 6 efficient for the Department of Labor to collect a 7 subset of standardized  8             JUSTICE BREYER:  You're not going to collect 9 anything.  All they're going to say is in our reg, you 10 have permission to go and impose these requirements. 11 But by having to go to them first, we prevent the 12 conflicting requirements of 50 different systems. 13             MS. ASAY:  And it's possible that they may 14 be able to do that.  I'm not sure where that authority 15 would come from  16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It  it  it isn't clear 17 that they're able to do that, is it? 18             MS. ASAY:  No. 19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It isn't clear that a 20 Federal agency can eliminate preemption by simply 21 saying, okay, you can go ahead and do it. 22             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm only asking.  My 23 point  24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even though it's otherwise 25 preempted under the statute, we say it's okay.  I  I

 3
             MS. ASAY:  It's  I think it's not clear 4 that they can do that.  And again, I think the question 5 for the Court is not what the Department of Labor can 6 do, but what Congress reserved to the States. 7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I  I know your time is 8 running up, but consider two cases.  Case one:  Vermont 9 is the only State that requires this.  Case two:  50 10 states requirement  require this and it's all 11 different and it's burdensome. 12             Same preemption analysis?
 13             MS. ASAY:  Yes, Your Honor, same preemption
 14 analysis as in Travelers and De Buono and Mackey. 15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And same result? 16             MS. ASAY:  Yes, Your Honor, same result.  As 17 in Mackey, where this Court held that State garnishment 18 litigation procedures as applied to the very benefits 19 that the plan was paying out were permissible.  Clearly, 20 those were going to vary State by State, and involve the 21 plans in StatebyState regulation. 22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  On rebuttal, because I 23 don't want to eat up more of your time, would you go 24 through the  through more careful  more slowly, the 25 fact that this information is all electronic, all of it

Let 19 me set out how we see the interaction of the preemption 20 framework and recordkeeping requirements, and then turn 21 to what I think DOL's role is here. 22             Both sides agree, essentially, that ERISA 23 plans can be subject to some reporting requirements, 24 probably many reporting requirements, incident to State 25 laws in other substantive fields.  So, for example, the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
19 1 Solicitor General gave the example of day care centers. 2 ERISA plans can run day care centers.  I don't think 3 anyone doubts that you can have all sorts of reporting 4 requirements to make sure the staff is trained, the 5 facilities are safe.  And so forth. 6             This Court's case in De Buono upheld a tax 7 imposed on employer contributions to an ERISA medical 8 benefit plan that provided the medical benefits 9 directly.  And we told the Court at the time that that 10 tax had all sorts of reporting requirements.  So 11 essentially, the question is here, where to draw the 12 line between reporting requirements that are permissible 13 and those that are nonpermissible. 14             As I take Respondent's view, it's that 15 they're  it's certain information that is so core to 16 the plan that you simply can't have State law reporting 17 requirements about that information. 18             I don't think that can be right.  Take, for 19 example, real property held in trust by a pension plan. 20 DOL requires reporting on that.  Obviously, you need to 21 know the assets the pension plan has, but certainly a 22 State taxing authority can require reporting about that 23 same information to assess a property tax. 24             The same was true with the tax in De Buono. 25 The same is true, by the way, in Dillingham.  That was a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 case about an ERISArun apprentice program.  And

20

2 California law said, you either follow our standards for

3 apprenticeship, or you have to pay a higher wage.  I

4 mean, that was as core as you get.  It was literally the

5 way the apprenticeship program was set up.

6             So I don't think the test can be whether the

7 information is, in some sense, core to ERISA.  I think

8 the test has to be, is this reporting requirement

9 incident to a law in the field governed by ERISA, 

10 vesting, funding, fiduciary duties and so forth  or is

11 it incident to a law in health care, or in day care

12 center regulation?

13             Here, I don't think anyone disputes:  This

14 information is used for hospital budget review, for

15 health insurance rate review, for medical research.

16 There's no question that it's incident to classic State

17 health care regulation.

18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why isn't there also a

19 requirement that the law just not be burdensome over a

20 certain level?

21             MR. BASH:  It  it is, Justice Kagan.  And

22 I  I think I cut short my test.

23             The first inquiry is:  Is this incident to a

24 field that ERISA doesn't govern?  I think that's

25 satisfied here.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             But then there's still another question

21

2 under Travelers, which looked to both purpose and

3 effects of whether the effect of the law is so

4 burdensome that effectively frustrates or impedes the

5 design of ERISA plans or the administration of ERISA

6 plans.  And I think a law like this that imposes

7 reporting requirements on a claim could theoretically be

8 that burdensome.  And so when 

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How is that any different

10 than conflict preemption?  How does that give any

11 special effect to the statute here?  I mean, you could

12 make that argument if there was no preemption provision.

13             MR. BASH:  Well, I  I think the way it's

14 different than conflict preemption, or at least one way,

15 is that if it actually is in the core field governed by

16 ERISA, I mean, if the State said, we just want to make

17 sure these pension plans are wellfunded, so we're going

18 to ask for reports incident to that role, it would be

19 preempted even if the requirements weren't particularly

20 burdensome.

21             I mean, the Court has never held that in a

22 specific case, but I think the Court's analysis leans

23 towards that direction.  So it could either be within

24 the preempted field, in which case it relates to ERISA

25 plans and it's out, or it could be so burdensome that it

Official
22 1 effectively frustrates the purpose of a uniform ERISA  2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The former sounds to me 3 like standard field preemption and the latter like 4 standard conflict preemption. 5             MR. BASH:  Well, I think there have been  6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that what you're saying? 7             MR. BASH:  There have been some wellwritten 8 separate opinions in this area that  9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I know that. 10             (Laughter.) 11             MR. BASH:  I don't think  I don't think  12 and here's what I would say about that:  I mean, I know 13 your opinion and the opinion of a few other justices 14 have suggested we should shift to field preemption.  I 15 think if the Court were to say what we've been doing all 16 along is field preemption, and it makes more sense 17 doctrinally to classify it that way, from the Department 18 of Labor's perspective, that would be fine. 19             I think we would be a little bit concerned 20 if the Court signaled to lower courts in its opinion 21 that it was marking a big shift in its jurisprudence 22 that could destabilize the law.  We think  23             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why aren't you on the other 24 side of the case?  That is, I was fine with you until I 25 read a few of these amicus briefs, and then suddenly I
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
23 1 saw 93 million people.  And there are associations all 2 over the place that are worried about this problem.  And 3 they have a big chart where they show the possibilities 4 of  of conflict.  You yourself are worried about 5 conflict.  Conflict among States in requirements means 6 money.  A lot of money.  That's what they say, and 7 that's plausible. 8             So what I want to know is:  What do you all 9 propose to do about that in the U.S. government?  One 10 thing to do about it  and I've looked up the regs, so 11 maybe Justice Scalia disagrees, but I'm talking about 12 what I think.  All right? 13             The  the  it seems like they would have 14 authority to issue regs either way; blocking, or getting 15 permission first.  That's where I ended up, and that's 16 what I wanted your view about.  You see what I'm saying? 17             MR. BASH:  I see what you're saying. 18 There's two pieces there, whether this actually has a 19 burden and what we could do about it if there was.  I 20 didn't mean to suggest we think it has a burden. 21             It's the view of the Department of Justice 22 that the significant burden has not been shown  the 23 Department of Labor that the significant burden has not 24 been shown here.  So that starting premise, we do not 25 agree with that.  All I'm saying is that if a party
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
24 1 could show that burden, that would raise a substantial 2 preemption question and would be highly relevant to the 3 preemption analysis. 4             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Then why hasn't that burden 5 been shown? 6             MR. BASH:  Respondent submitted nothing 7 below.  I mean, really.  They submitted an Internet fax 8 sheet  9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  There's something very 10 intuitive about their argument, and it's  it's 11 essentially what Justice Kennedy said.  It's  it's 12 when 50 States devise 50 different requirements for 13 this, different formatting, different particular 14 information requested, that just all adds up to a lot of 15 hassle, which all adds up to a lot of money. 16             MR. BASH:  Two points.  I mean, first it 17 seems far less burdensome than State laws this Court has 18 already upheld, or that State laws that I think most 19 people would agree have to be upheld. 20             I mean, the tax  or the surcharge in 21 Travelers  that was the case where you bought 22 commercial insurance, you had to pay a surcharge up to 23 24 percent more on medical purchases, that's 24 unbelievably burdensome, and surely had reporting 25 requirements associated with it.  And having to pay
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 vastly different surcharges in 50 States could be

25

2 burdensome too.

3             What this Court's precedents have said,

4 including Travelers and Dillingham and De Buono is that

5 a mere burden is not enough.  What has to be shown is

6 that it interferes with the administration of benefits.

7             So in Egelhoff 

8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but a

9 consistent theme in our cases, when you say a mere

10 burden is not enough, is that the government wants

11 employers to, one, set things up  they don't have to

12  and two, they want the money to go to benefits, not

13 to go to administrative and bureaucracy expenses.

14             Is it your view in analyzing this question,

15 do we look at what would happen if 50 States adopted

16 different programs, or do we look at just Vermont

17 because Vermont happens to be first?

18             MR. BASH:  The former.  Our view is you have

19 to contemplate the 50 States would adopt different

20 regimes?

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah, I think that's

22 right.  So you don't think 50 different regimes of

23 reporting is going to require a significant diversion of

24 money away from benefits to administration?

25             MR. BASH:  Not  not on this record.  Mr.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Chief Justice, recall 

26

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What kind of a

3 record do you need to show that?

4             MR. BASH:  Well 

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Of course you can't

6 have a record of what 50 States are doing if it's a

7 hypothetical question.

8             MR. BASH:  Well, I think there's a couple

9 ways Respondent could have made the showing here.  I

10 mean, at minimum, Respondent could have had its own

11 thirdparty administrator come in and say these

12 reporting requirements are burdensome; this is what

13 we've had to do.  We've had to change the way we process

14 claims because they're so burdensome.  I suspect they

15 could not have made that showing 

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  But you have pages 26 and

17 27 of the Blue Cross Blue Shield brief.  And there they

18 have a big chart, and there are all these organizations

19 out there that are trying, like the Uniform Law

20 Commissioners, to create uniformity.  That's why I say

21 that's why I'm puzzled as to what to do.

22             Am I supposed to write an opinion that says

23 even though Blue Cross Blue Shield feels it's a big mess

24 and trying to straighten it out, they didn't make the

25 right record in the Vermont trial court?  How do I write

Alderson Reporting Company

1 that opinion?

Official

27

2             MR. BASH:  Going to the  the chart point,

3 I mean, the chart actually doesn't show conflicting

4 requirements.  Most of the counterpoints they have is

5 like not required.  I don't think there are conflicting

6 requirements.

7             And even if you look at the end of the Blue

8 Cross Blue Shield brief, they never actually say this

9 is 

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I'm serious.  How

11 do I write the opinion?  I suppose it could happen, but

12 it hasn't happened yet.  How do I write the opinion?

13             MR. BASH:  I think  I think the opinion is

14 written like this:  One, this is a reporting requirement

15 incident to a field that is not governed by ERISA,

16 health care regulation.  It's presumptively valid, but

17 we're going to look and see if Respondent has made a

18 showing that it's so burdensome, it fundamentally

19 changes the way plans are administered or designed.

20 Respondent has not made that showing here.  That is how

21 the opinion is written.

22             I mean, this Court has never actually said

23 that a burden is so bad that it's preempted, even if it

24 operates in a field outside of ERISA.  It has suggested

25 in dicta that it's possible, but that is inherently a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 factual determination, and it's hard to see how the

28

2 Court could reach that conclusion without some factual

3 showing 

4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So we go through at

5 one point  all of a sudden there  the 11th State

6 that does this, and it's the 11 different things, we say

7 is that a burden?  Is that a sufficient burden?  We say

8 no.  But then when 30 States do it, maybe it's a

9 different answer.  That seems like a very odd preemption

10 analysis.

11             MR. BASH:  Well, I  I don't think it

12 should turn on that, Mr. Chief Justice.  I do think it's

13 appropriate for a court to consider what if 50 States

14 impose different requirements like this.  But just like

15 50 different States might have different requirements

16 for daycare centers, or for prepaid legal services,

17 that, I don't think, is the sort of burden 

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but this goes

19 to basic, very comprehensive reporting of data.  It's

20 not simply, well, if you run a daycare center, you have

21 to comply with the rules about daycare centers.  Of

22 course you do.  It's quite different.

23             One of the things ERISA plans do is report

24 data and compile data.  And it seems to me that the

25 analysis that says, well, daycare centers you can.  That

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 seems a little bit off basis.

29

2             MR. BASH:  May I respond, Mr. Chief Justice?

3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.

4             Of course you can.

5             (Laughter.)

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Please.

7             MR. BASH:  I think that the  I'll try to

8 do it in two sentences.

9             I think that the burden here is far less

10 substantial than the burden of complying with State

11 apprenticeship regulations for the way you designed the

12 program in Dillingham.  Here, most selfinsured plans

13 use thirdparty administrators.  And often those

14 thirdparty administrators are insurance companies that

15 already have the infrastructure in place for reporting

16 requirements as applied to them which cannot be

17 preempted under ERISA.

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

19             Mr. Waxman.

20              ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

21                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22             MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

23 please the Court:

24             A signal goal of ERISA enacted in 1974 was

25 to foster employee benefit plans that could operate

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 nationally under nationally uniform rules of

30

2 administration, first and foremost, rules about

3 recordkeeping and reporting.

4             Now, of course ERISA plans, like other

5 regular businesses, are subject to ancillary regulation

6 like maintaining a safe workplace, paying minimum wage

7 and prevailing wage laws, paying their State real estate

8 taxes on their headquarters, and if they choose to run a

9 hospital, run a law firm for their legal services,

10 benefit program, run a childcare center, they are

11 subject to local regulation like other providers of

12 those local services.

13             But in every single case in this Court, and

14 every lower court decision that I have found in which

15 courts have upheld, State by State, reporting

16 requirements, it has always been incident to a

17 substantive obligation that the State could impose.  And

18 no one contends that Vermont could impose substantive

19 regulations on the claims that Liberty Mutual pays under

20 its employment plan.

21             Now, I want to go to the point of 

22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Waxman, why was it that

23 you introduced absolutely no evidence of burden in the

24 lower courts here?

25             MR. WAXMAN:  That is not true, Justice

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
31 1 Kagan.  What  we did not introduce any evidence about 2 what it would cost us in dollars and cents to have Blue 3 Cross Blue Shield comply with the Vermont request that 4 is the subject to the subpoena.  But we did introduce 5 substantial evidence in the record below, and  and 6 some of it is included in the Joint Appendix, and all 7 the pages that are extra long folded in, about what it 8 is that we have to do, both in Vermont and in the then 9 15 other States that imposed very, very different 10 reporting obligations. 11             So we didn't put a dollars and cents in, but 12 we did make the lower court, the district court, on its 13 request, very aware of this very substantial burden. 14             And Congress, in determining  in  in 15 deciding to, in exchange for blanket Federal regulation 16 of these fostered national plans, to grant a very broad 17 preemption provision that says this is going to be 18 Federal regulation  19             JUSTICE BREYER:  What about the converse  20             MR. WAXMAN:   not State regulation. 21             JUSTICE BREYER:  What about the converse? 22 What about the converse point for you that I was making 23 before?  The number that jumped out from the page is the 24 93 million people this affects.  Now, that's a huge 25 number, and therefore the risk of conflicting
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 regulations is serious 

32

2             MR. WAXMAN:  It's 

3             JUSTICE BREYER:   in raising costs.

4 That's for you.  But they say it hasn't been shown

5 yet 

6             MR. WAXMAN:  Well, that 

7             JUSTICE BREYER:   so I ask you:  If it

8 does come about, if it should come about and you lost

9 this case, why can't your clients go right to the

10 Department of Labor, whose regulations I've read, or

11 possibly ACCA, and say, we want you to impose a uniform

12 national data collection system or the equivalent, put

13 limits, and then preempt the conflicting State limits?

14             Now, it may be other members of the Court do

15 not agree with this approach, but I've written a case,

16 MetroMedia, where I think the agencies have a lot of

17 power there, and I think they have more capacity to

18 decide this kind of thing than a group of judges.

19             So what about that for you?

20             MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Breyer, a couple of

21 points:

22             First, in the lower court and in this Court,

23 neither party on the other side has disputed what I

24 think is the selfevident proposition, that the

25 Department of Labor and now the Department of Labor and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
33 1 the Department of Health and Human Services, absolutely 2 have the statutory authority under ERISA to impose the 3 kind of recordkeeping and reporting requirements that 4 Vermont and now 17 or 19 other States do.  They have 5 never disavowed that.  The  the SG's brief at both the 6 invitation stage and the merits stage sort of coyly 7 suggests that that's right, and  8             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that sounds like a 9 onesizefitsall solution, and there's some value to 10 States being able to think about their own health care 11 needs. 12             MR. WAXMAN:  Of course. 13             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And to think about what 14 things they want. 15             So I mean, just again, let's go back to this 16 burden because it is a very intuitive idea that you have 17 on your side:  50 different States; that's a lot of 18 money.  But I guess I wonder why it is a lot of money. 19 I mean, as I understand what's going on here, that all 20 the data that's being requested is data that Blue Cross 21 Blue Shield generates anyway.  That all the data that's 22 being requested is data that Blue Cross Blue Shield 23 reports for other people.  That really this is a 24 formatting question, even with respect to the wide 25 variety of States, that the States have started getting
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 their formatting more uniform.

34

2             So I  I mean, you know, it's  you can

3 say it's 93 million people, but, you know, in the end

4 what's the cost?

5             MR. WAXMAN:  Oh.

6             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And why don't you have it in

7 the record?

8             MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  I  there is not a 

9 with respect to burden, Congress, in enacting the

10 preemption provision and their  we  we've cited to

11 the Court place after place in the conference reports,

12 the House reports, the statements of the sponsors, the

13 recognition in  in repealing the Disclosure Act, which

14 set a reporting  a national reporting floor and

15 allowed the States to add onto it and record evidence

16 before Congress that small plans were spending up to

17 40 percent of their entire assets on State reporting.

18 Congress made the determination that this Court has

19 reflected in many, many of its decisions, including

20 Egelhoff, that the very fact that there could be 50

21 different State regulations is the burden that the

22 preemption provision is designed to address.

23             And the notion  and that 

24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, we know  we know,

25 Mr. Waxman, that Blue  Blue Cross is providing this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 information with respect to individuals that its own

35

2 plans insure, and we're told that it is providing the

3 information for other selfinsured ERISA plans who

4 didn't make this objection.  So do we know at least what

5 is the burden of providing that information for the

6 other selfinsured ERISA plans that Blue Cross is  is

7 providing the information for?

8             MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Ginsburg, the Blue

9 Cross Blue Shield Association has actually filed a brief

10 in its  in this case, and it explains at great detail,

11 as does the brief of the multiemployer plans, which

12 like Liberty Mutual operate in 50 States, about the

13 burden, about the fact that Blue Cross Blue Shield

14 doesn't have all this information in the normal course,

15 the multiemployer plans don't have it, and Blue Cross

16 Blue Shield, as a thirdparty administrator, has told

17 this Court just exactly how burdensome and how expensive

18 it is.

19             Of course they could do it for Liberty

20 Mutual in Vermont.  The only question is how much it's

21 going to cost and how much they're going to charge.

22             But look, for example, at since this 

23 since this litigation began, the Commonwealth of

24 Massachusetts has now told Liberty Mutual that it wants

25 reporting under its APCD statute.  And as we recount at

Alderson Reporting Company

And the chart that 7 we submitted in the district court reflects the wide 8 variation in States. 9             There is  the  the burden that Congress 10 foresaw is coming to play before our very eyes as 11 States  more and more States adopt these mandatory 12 plans. 13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that information, 14 the  the  the laundry list you went through, is that 15 already available at Blue Cross Blue Shield and being 16 reported somewhere else? 17             MR.

The multiemployer plan brief reports 20 that they only  that their plans generally have about 21 70 to 80 percent of the information that's required by 22 any one of these States.

4 And in fact, they've asked the Department of Labor to

5 permit State  States to operate their own ERISA

6 pension plans for their residents.

7             Now, they could pass a database statute that

8 says, we're really concerned about whether elderly, you

10 elder years, and we know that 93 million people are

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, they can prevent it

8 from being burdensome.

9             MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Breyer, I know how

10 exciting it is to get in the middle of a jurisprudential

11 debate between you and Justice Scalia.

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  But this

17 tingling at the prospect.  I am not sure 

18             (Laughter.)

19             MR. WAXMAN:  I am not sure that the

20 Department of Labor has the regulatory authority to

21 essentially excuse the preemption provision, but  and

22 you don't have to just go to the provision of ERISA that

23 you quoted  in 1024(a)(2)(B) of ERISA, it authorizes

24 the Secretary of Labor to require the production of,

25 quote, "any information or data from an ERISA plan where

Official
39 1 he finds that such data or information is necessary to 2 carry out the purposes of this subchapter."  And 3 adverting to Justice Alito's comments, in the ACCA, the 4 Secretary has the authority to require the production 5 of  from plans of, quote, "any other information as 6 determined appropriate by the Secretary." 7             So the notion that preemption here is sort 8 of like an  operates like an accordion  if the 9 Department of Labor has the authority to get it but 10 hasn't chosen to exercise, it's not preempted; but if 11 they did promulgate a regulation, either of your color 12 or Justice Scalia's color, that it would be preempted  13 is a crazy  is a crazy notion. 14             JUSTICE BREYER:  You might think this is not 15 sane, but what I'm  the way I'm seeing it here is 16 there are two competing problems.  One is they should be 17 able to get information like this in the States. 18             But two, there is a problem of burden. 19             And I think there are probably 100 or 200 20 people in Department of Labor and HHS that could write 21 regs that reconcile those problems and allow both.  But 22 I can't, because I'm a judge. 23             So what I'm trying to figure out is how to 24 interpret this statute in a way that achieves those 25 objectives.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
40 1             MR. WAXMAN:  How to interpret this statute 2 as to say that in exchange for blanket Federal 3 regulation of these plans, now augmented in the context 4 of health care plans by the Affordable Care Act, the  5 by the Federal government, the States are preempted from 6 regulating the core functions of what an ERISA plan 7 does.  And there is nothing more core than the payment 8 of benefits. 9             If the State is attempting to regulate, 10 whether it's by substantively regulating or imposing a 11 recordkeeping or reporting obligation about the very 12 activity that defines it as an  as an ERISA plan, the 13 payment of benefits, that State law necessarily relates 14 to, because it has a connection with, an ERISA plan. 15             And frankly, it's pretty ironic that the 16 Petitioner and the government claim on the one hand that 17 it is so important to get this information from these 18 plans because 60 percent of all citizens in the 19 United States get their health care from these 20 selffunded plans, and yet requiring them to keep the 21 particular records that the State wants and to report it 22 on a quarterly, annually, or monthly basis, has no 23 relation to or connection with the plan.  I don't 24 understand how both of those thoughts can inhere at the 25 same time.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
41 1             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Waxman, I guess I just 2 don't understand this argument.  I  I  I mean, I  3 I understand completely that there should be some 4 restriction on overly burdensome State regulations of 5 whatever kind.  You know, it could be taxes, it could be 6 day care, it could be anything.  Right?  But why is it 7 that this regulation falls in a different category than 8 taxes or childcare or anything else?  Because the State 9 here clearly is not attempting to, and is not 10 regulating, payment of benefits.  It's doing something 11 that has an effect on your operations, no doubt, but the 12 State is operating in a completely separate area for 13 completely separate purposes in a way that does not 14 trump or conflict with, or anything else, the choices 15 that ERISA has made as to payment of benefits. 16             MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  I  I want to  I want 17 to come to the end and dispute that premise that you  18 the end of your question.  But if the  if you look at 19 this Court's cases that have set about to evaluate the 20 burden, or at least included, as in the last section of 21 Travelers, a section that says of course if this were 22 terribly burdensome there might be another question, 23 those are cases  and it's Travelers, Dillingham, and 24 De Buono.  We all agree on that  those were all cases 25 in which there was a burden being placed on an entity
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that wasn't  in Travelers it was hospitals; in

42

2 De Buono it was hospitals; in Dillingham it was

3 apprenticeship programs, all of which affected the price

4 that ERISA plans might have to pay to get benefits or

5 services from those kinds of providers.

6             And so it took several sentences in each of

7 those  several paragraphs in each of those opinions

8 even to explain how putting a tax on the nonBlue Cross

9 insurance plans in Travelers, or respecting the

10 prevailing wage rate in California, actually had an

11 effect on any ERISA plan anyway, because they weren't

12 regulation of the plans, per se.  They were indirect

13 regulations.  And when the regulation is indirect, that

14 is, it is not a regulation that is directed at the very

15 activity that makes the plan an ERISA plan, you do look

16 at burden.  And indirect regulation obviously can occur.

17 But if  as this Court explained in the last section of

18 Travelers, if it's too burdensome, it might be

19 preempted.

20             But where the regulation is direct, where

21 the State is requiring reporting because the self 

22 because the selfinsured plan is engaged in the very

23 activity that brings it under ERISA that qualifies it as

24 an ERISA plan, that obviously relates to and has a

25 connection with the plan, and is preempted.

Alderson Reporting Company

43 1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You're  you're saying 2 that the State simply cannot have an all  allpayer 3 database, that that's out because ERISA precludes it, 4 even though it's going to leave a big hole in the 5 information that the State has about that health care 6 being given to its citizens, 7             MR. WAXMAN:  I don't think that that's at 8 all the case, Justice Ginsburg, and I don't want to be 9 misunderstood about this. 10             The State of Vermont, just to take one 11 example:  The database statute authorizes the relevant 12 Secretary to obtain this information from everybody, not 13 only who pays for health care in Vermont, but the 14 hospitals and clinics that provide it.  But the 15 Secretary, the executive official has chosen not to 16 require that information from hospitals and clinics and 17 doctors in Vermont. 18             There is also no doubt that if allpayer 19 claims databases so badly need the information from 20 selffunded plans, and it turns out that the selffunded 21 plan  a significant number of selffunded plans say 22 no, that's preempted, the Federal government has all the 23 authority it needs to get that information and require 24 that that information be provided, either to the 25 Secretary and then to the States, or directly to the

44

2             And in fact, they can do what often happens

3 in areas of field preemption and express preemption,

4 which is to make it worth the plan's while.  You know?

5 They can offer all sorts of benefits to selfemployed

6 plans to provide this information if it's so important.

7             What's interesting when we're talking about

8 what is or isn't in the record in this case, is no

9 explanation whatsoever from the State of Vermont at any

10 stage as to why they haven't requested the actual

11 providers of these health care services to provide the

12 information and that it is inadequate.  I mean, the 

13 the  the only exchange I can recall is in the Second

14 Circuit oral argument transcript, which is recorded and

15 discussed in Judge  Judge Straub's dissenting opinion,

16 the State was asked, you know, look, how important is it

17 to get the  the  the district judge  I think it

18 was the district judge 

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well  well, as  as

20 you're explaining this, it just seems to me it's much

21 easier to ask the plan provider than to ask 15 doctors

22 in  in  in one small town, and 50 others, and all

23 the patients 

24             MR. WAXMAN:  You know 

25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   unless I misunderstand

Alderson Reporting Company

1 your point 

Official

45

2             MR. WAXMAN:  No, you're not.

3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:   it seems to me it's

4 much  much easier.

5             MR. WAXMAN:  It  perhaps it's easier, but

6 here's the point.  And this is the insight of the ERISA

7 preemption provision:  The hospitals in Vermont, the

8 clinics in Vermont, the medical practices in Vermont are

9 not subject to varying regulation in 50 different

10 States.  They operate locally.  They're subject to State

11 regulation.

12             Here, we're talking about plans that

13 Congress wanted to encourage that would do something

14 new, that would provide health care benefits and other

15 employee benefits on a national basis, and in order to

16 foster that, to subject them to a single set of

17 reporting, recordkeeping, and regulatory obligations.

18             And that, it seems to me, is the insight of

19 ERISA.  And it was the  the bargain that ERISA plainly

20 struck.

21             I  I simply noted in response to

22 Justice Ginsburg's question that the State statute gives

23 them the authority to do it.  There aren't that many

24 hospitals in Vermont.  They already have all the

25 information about what services are or aren't being

Alderson Reporting Company

1 provided.

Official

46

2             The State could have said, no, no, no.  We

3 absolutely can't get by without this.  But the

4 representation at oral argument in front of the judge,

5 which has also been transcribed and is in the record,

6 the State  the lawyer representing the State  the

7 judge was sort of trying to settle this case and said,

8 you know, how much do you really need this information?

9 And the response was, we don't really need it.  This is

10 just a couple of employees.  This is just one plan.  But

11 there's a principle here.

12             And we agree with that.  And we also agree

13 with the representations of my friends on the other side

14 that the question for this Court  it has to take

15 account of the possibility, which is the emerging

16 reality, that all 50 States and the District of Columbia

17 and Puerto Rico will have their own mandatory allpayer

18 claims databases that will require different things.

19             And if I can just anticipate Justice

20 Sotomayor's question reserved for rebuttal to  to the

21 State of Vermont, our brief explains, and the Blue Cross

22 Blue Shield brief also explains, how there are  of the

23 hundreds of data fields that Vermont alone requires,

24 there are dozens of them as to which there is no ICD 

25 whatever the  the  the agreed national format is.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
47 1 There are dozens and dozens of them as to which there is 2 no HIPAA standard, no HIPAA guarantee of 3 confidentiality.  And this is just one State.  If you 4 look, as I said, at the Massachusetts APCD statute, 5 which is the only other State that's actually come to 6 Liberty Mutual so far, and look at our discussion of it 7 on Page 36, the stuff that they are asking for is so 8 obviously critical to what the plan does. 9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this is  this 10 information is provided by Blue Cross for some 11 selfinsured plans, right? 12             MR. WAXMAN:  I believe that  I believe 13 that the record shows that Blue Cross Blue Shield 14 provides this information to Vermont, not only on behalf 15 of itself as an insurer, but also some other  16             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And do we know  do we 17 know what costs Blue Shield then passes on to those 18 other selfinsured plans? 19             MR. WAXMAN:  We don't know it.  We were not 20 able to get it from Blue Cross at the time the case was 21 before the district judge. 22             But in any event, as the Chief Justice's 23 question suggests, the  this issue doesn't end at 24 Vermont.  It  it has to take account of a burden that 25 Congress was very, very aware of, it was very cognizant
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
48 1 of the regime under the Repeal Disclosure Act, and the 2 costs of plans that are trying to be national plans 3 complying with 50 different State regulations. 4             And I really commend to the Court the amicus 5 brief filed by the multiemployer plans in this case. 6 These are plans that are essentially unionsponsored 7 plans.  They are not fancy plans.  Every dollar that 8 they have to spend comply  gathering the data that 9 each State  that different States say they have to 10 have comes directly out of the benefits that they can 11 pay.  Just as if  if Vermont decides next week, if it 12 wins this case, that it wants to get information about 13 pension plans, and how they're being administered, and 14 what benefits are being provided and not provided, those 15 are all 100 percent selffunded plans.  If my employer 16 has to provide all that information, that is coming out 17 of my 401(k) benefits. 18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Waxman, could a State 19 pass a tax law that requires information about  about 20 pension disbursements, about claim payments, about 21 assets held in trust?  Could a State do that? 22             MR. WAXMAN:  I don't think that a State  23 when you're saying requested information or imposing a 24 tax? 25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  A tax law that requires

3 think a State can impose a tax on benefits that are 

4             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Not impose a tax, that

5 requires information in order to ensure that the State

6 is taxing the right things.

7             MR. WAXMAN:  In other words, we want to tax

8 the benefits that you're getting 

9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think that a State

10 tax law can't require any information about any of the

11 things that ERISA does, that the plans do, pension

12 disbursements, assets, claim payments, nothing?

13             MR. WAXMAN:  I  I think not.  I think that

14 the State  I mean, I don't think this case turns on

15 it, but thinking about it, if the State could say, look,

16 we just want to know all the benefits that you pay every

17 one of our residents, I think that would be preempted.

18             As I say, that's  that's not what's going

19 on here.  And even if I'm wrong about it, it seems to me

20 that this is quite different.  You know, there is a lot

21 of discussion on the other side of, you know, this just

22 requires the press of a button and all the information

23 goes.

24             And our brief goes on for pages and pages,

25 and the other amici  amicus briefs show how that is so

Official
50 1 far from true.  In order to comply with these, it's not 2 just a question of saying, oh, yes, we paid Seth Waxman 3 $300 in benefits last year.  This requires that we keep 4 records that we don't keep, and that we display them and 5 provide information in ways that we don't, and that 6 differ from one State to another.  And for those 7 reasons, unless the Court has questions, I will submit 8 that the judgment should be affirmed. 9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 10             Ms. Asay, you have three minutes remaining. 11           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIDGET C.

ASAY:  Thank you. 14             I'd like to begin with Justice Sotomayor's 15 question about the standardized data, because I think 16 that ties in nicely with many questions from the Court 17 about the question of burden. 18             So the way that electronic claims 19 transactions work is not something that the State of 20 Vermont invented.  It's part of HIPAA.  It's a Federal 21 regulation called the Electronic Transaction Rule, and 22 it sets standardized coding and formatting requirements 23 for the transaction between the payer and the provider. 24             And we  we don't even have to look to the 25 regulation for that, although that's in 45 C.F.R. Part
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 160, but it's actually in the record at Joint

51

2 Appendix 66.  This is the agreement between Blue Cross

3 and Liberty Mutual, which says that Blue Cross shall be

4 capable of transmitting electronic data for which

5 transaction standards have been promulgated in

6 compliance with HIPAA Electronic Transactions Rule and

7 shall, to the extent possible, transmit electronic data

8 in accordance with that rule.

9             That is how thirdparty administrators work,

10 and that is why selfinsured plans nearly always have a

11 thirdparty administrator, which is typically a health

12 insurer to process claims, because although it may look

13 on the surface as though these reporting requirements

14 and the  the data collection seems very complicated,

15 it's complicated not because of anything Vermont has

16 done.  It's because there is the standardized national

17 standard for how this data is collected, which is fairly

18 specific, fairly detailed, and they're already doing it.

19             And it is generating a pool of tremendously

20 helpful data that has incredible potential to help

21 States and the Federal government figure out ways to

22 bend the cost curve and improve the provision of health

23 care delivery to everyone in the country.

24             The Affordable Care Act expressly

25 contemplated that States would do this kind of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
52 1 experimentation.  It authorized the Federal government 2 to provide Medicare claims data to the States.  It 3 authorized  it created the Center for Medicare and 4 Medicaid Innovation, which then authorized States to 5 experiment, to develop new models for delivery, which 6 then need to be tested and evaluated.  And the 7 United States has explained in its brief that those 8 programs depend upon the collection of allpayer data, 9 which is something only the States are doing. 10             The promise here is enormous, and the 11 fact  and the loss of this data to the plans would be 12 tremendous.  I would like to address briefly one issue 13 that my friend raised, which is the question of provider 14 data.  Vermont does, in fact, collect provider data, and 15 we've collected it for a very long time.  It's called 16 hospital discharge data, and it was one of the first 17 data sets that researchers looked to.  But it's not as 18 helpful as allpayer data, and here's why. 19             Hospitals don't have information that tracks 20 care across an episode of care.  If someone has their 21 knee replaced, it starts with the doctor's visit, their 22 surgery.  There's an anesthesiologist.  There's a stay 23 at a rehab facility.  There's followup physical 24 therapy.  And if you're trying to compare outcomes and 25 costs for a procedure like that, it's the payer, the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
53 1 centralized payer, as Justice Kennedy said, who has all 2 that information.  There's only a few of them.  That is 3 the real power of the data, and it's not in the hospital 4 data.

             Thank you. 6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 7 The case is submitted. 8             (Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the 9 aboveentitled matter was submitted.) 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
