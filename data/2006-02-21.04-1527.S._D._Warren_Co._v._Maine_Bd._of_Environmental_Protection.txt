2 [11:34 a.m.]

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

4 next in S. D. Warren Company versus Maine Board of

5 Environmental Protection.

6 Mr. Kayatta.

7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. KAYATTA, JR.,

8 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9 MR. KAYATTA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it -

10 - and may it please the Court:

11 The Presumpscot River is a single body of

12 water, as that term was used in last year's Miccosukee

13 decision. Warren's position is that the flowing of

14 that single body of water through Warren's five dams is

15 not a discharge into that same single body of water.

16 In arguing that certification under section 401 of the

17 Clean Water Act is, therefore, not required, we are not

18 maintaining that the State either has, or should have,

19 no voice on matters of water quality in connection with

20 the relicensing of these dams.

21 In 1986, Congress took care to ensure States

22 a forceful, but not controlling, voice on environmental

23 issues, including water quality issues, in all

24 hydropower relicensing proceedings. Congress was very

25 specific about its intent in 1986, and it intended to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 give States a strong voice, but not a veto. So, we

2 feel the case -- that the States clearly have that

3 voice.

4 Now --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kayatta, if I

6 took a drum of water out of the river and put it in the

7 garage next to the river for 5 years, and, 5 years

8 later, came out and poured that drum of water back into

9 the river, is that a discharge into the river?

10 MR. KAYATTA: Yes, that would be a discharge

11 into the river.

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is it different

13 here, where you have the dam restraining the waters for

14 a certain period, and then it's being released later,

15 at a subsequent time? Why --

16 MR. KAYATTA: Yes.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- isn't that also a

18 discharge?

19 MR. KAYATTA: There is -- we draw a

20 distinction -- and I'm referring just to discharge, I'm

21 not addressing the issue that the Court could get to in

22 another case of whether you actually need a discharge

23 of a pollutant, as to just a discharge into the river -

24 - we draw a distinction between actually removing

25 something entirely from the river, exercising control

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 over it. Your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, had it

2 for 5 years. In that situation, one could say that

3 there may be a discharge into the river when an

4 activity is proposed to pour that back into the river.

5 In a -- in the dams -- the dams, the water

6 continuously flows down. The water never leaves the

7 single body of water called the Presumpscot. And

8 that's the distinction that we would draw.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though it's

10 retained in a -- what -- an impoundment pool, or

11 whatever, behind --

12 MR. KAYATTA: Well, the dams slow down the

13 water as it comes down the Presumpscot. And because

14 the dams slow down the water, then the river widens in

15 an area called an impoundment area. But the -- there

16 is a continuous motion leaving the dam in the same

17 amount of water that comes into the area above the dam.

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, this --

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you think it's a

20 different case if it's not a continuous motion; in

21 other words, that the water is released -- you know,

22 it's released on the weekends, but, during the week, it

23 has to build up in the -- you would draw a distinction

24 and say there's a discharge, in that case?

25 MR. KAYATTA: Mr. Chief Justice, the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 distinction we would draw would be when the exercise

2 over the water, and the separation of the water from

3 the river, reach the point where it could be said that

4 we're no longer dealing with one unitary body of water,

5 as that term is defined in Miccosukee. If we --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But this is an important

7 point for me, and I wasn't quite clear what the briefs

8 told me about it. My understanding was that there is

9 an argument that when the water stays in the reservoir,

10 the impoundment area, that there's a stratification,

11 and the oxygen components at different levels change,

12 so that when the water goes back into the dam, it's

13 qualitatively different. It's the same water, in a

14 sense, but it's also qualitatively different in its

15 oxygen and other characteristics. And that sounded to

16 me like a discharge.

17 MR. KAYATTA: Yes. The -- there is -- there

18 is no dispute that when one changes the movement of

19 water and its flow, then characteristics of the water

20 can change. For example, in the impoundment area you

21 can have not a change, overall, of temperature, but a

22 stratification of warmer water going to the top, colder

23 water going to the bottom. Similarly, you can have

24 changes in other aspects of the water. All of those

25 have been classified by the EPA as nonpoint source

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 pollution. And it is undisputed that 401 does not

2 cover nonpoint source solution -- pollution. So --

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't --

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, if --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't --

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: But is it --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, if it were established

8 in this case that the water is qualitatively changed in

9 a significant degree because of its oxygen component,

10 that would be irrelevant to the question you're asking?

11 MR. KAYATTA: The water, as it comes into the

12 dam and in the impoundment area, there is a -- there

13 are findings, that we are not here challenging, that

14 that water changes as it comes into the impoundment

15 area. The discharge of that water -- that water then

16 flows through the dam on its way down the river. There

17 is nothing -- there is no nexus between the water

18 exiting the dam and any of the changes that Your Honor

19 has pointed to.

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying the changes

22 occur in the river, above the dam; and, therefore,

23 what's left -- what's let back into the river below the

24 dam is the same river, unchanged.

25 MR. KAYATTA: We're saying that the river

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 flows continuously down. It changes at various points

2 as it goes down a river. As it goes through rapids, a

3 river changes. The nature of a river changes as it

4 goes over rapids. As it comes --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Now, let me just be sure I

6 understand one point fully. But the character of the

7 water is different above the dam and below the dam.

8 MR. KAYATTA: No. The character of the water

9 --

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: I thought you agreed that

11 there was a different -- a different oxygen content in

12 the water.

13 MR. KAYATTA: The water -- take the -- Mr.

14 Chief Justice's barrel of water that has not been

15 removed from the river -- it comes down the river. It

16 changes as it goes down the river. It is potentially

17 changed in the impoundment area. It then flows through

18 the dam.

19 JUSTICE STEVENS: No.

20 MR. KAYATTA: The same water that went into

21 the dam --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but it's the same

23 water, with a slightly different chemical composition,

24 isn't that true?

25 MR. KAYATTA: It's the same water that went

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 into the dam as comes out of the dam.

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: But with a slightly

3 different chemical composition.

4 MR. KAYATTA: Than it was further --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct --

6 MR. KAYATTA: -- up the river.

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- when I say that?

8 MR. KAYATTA: Yes, you are.

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you said -- in response

11 to Justice Kennedy's question, you said that there was

12 nothing, I think, as you put it, in the exiting of the

13 water that was significantly different that -- or that

14 we could peg as significantly different. But that

15 seems to me to be at odds with your answer to the Chief

16 Justice's question about the barrel, because the

17 exiting of the water from the barrel and the exiting of

18 the water from the dam are exactly the same. And if

19 one is a discharge, I don't see why the other isn't a

20 discharge.

21 MR. KAYATTA: Well, the difference, we would

22 say, is that, in the barrel hypothetical, the water has

23 been -- the water that is put into the river from the

24 barrel that has been in someone's garage for 5 years --

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then it isn't the exiting

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that you're getting at. And I --

2 MR. KAYATTA: Well, we --

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, it seems to me --

4 and I don't want to make a joke, but I think you're on

5 to something when you talk about the exiting, because

6 the word "discharge," as we commonly use it, is a word

7 that describes how you get rid of something. And how

8 you get rid of something, it seems to me, is exactly

9 the same, whether you're pouring the barrel over the

10 bank or whether pouring the barrel, as it were, through

11 the turbine after impounding it, it is the --

12 everybody's been quoting dictionary definitions -- it's

13 the "flowing out." The flowing out is the same with

14 the barrel as it is with the dam.

15 MR. KAYATTA: The difference --

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: And that seems to me where I

17 have trouble with your argument.

18 MR. KAYATTA: Yes, Justice Souter. The

19 difference is the "discharge into." To have something

20 "discharge into the river," you need something

21 different than the river to go into the river.

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, as I understand it, in

23 some or all of these dams, at the point of discharge,

24 there isn't any river down there. It's dry. It's --

25 the bed, in effect, has been deprived of the river by

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the impoundment, so that you're not simply, as it were,

2 taking, you know, one spoonful out here and dropping it

3 into a river -- putting the spoonful back into a river

4 that's flowing there, because it isn't flowing there,

5 as a result of your dam.

6 MR. KAYATTA: But the -- if you accept the

7 proposition that the river is divided into two

8 different things, then you can start to talk about a

9 discharge of one thing into the other. But Miccosukee

10 makes clear that the structure of a dam does not keep

11 us from viewing this as a single body of water which

12 flows through a dam. It does not flow "into the

13 navigable waters"; the navigable waters themselves flow

14 through the dam.

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Miccosukee assumed that --

16 the soup ladle example from the Second Circuit; you

17 took out the ladle, you held it up, and you put the

18 same thing back. But if I understand what happens as a

19 result of the impoundment of the water and then its

20 release, what comes out is quite different from what

21 was put in. It's kind of like you had a pot boiling

22 with vegetables, and then you put it through a food

23 processor, and then what you got out would be quite

24 different from what went into the food processor.

25 MR. KAYATTA: Yes. And, again, we don't

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 dispute that there are nonpoint source changes in the

2 water as it flows down the river, before it goes

3 through the dam. The water that then goes in and emits

4 --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the descriptions

6 that we had was, it is a result of the impoundment and

7 the subsequent release that the water emerges in this

8 unnatural state, in this striated state that Justice

9 Kennedy was referring to.

10 MR. KAYATTA: Yes. The -- it is the

11 impoundment that changes the nature of the water.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: And not the release. You

13 contest that the release makes any change.

14 MR. KAYATTA: The release simply continues

15 the flow of that water, albeit however it has been

16 changed by mechanisms other than discharges into the

17 river.

18 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's true, but --

19 so, you said it's conceded in this case? I thought, in

20 answer to Justice Kennedy, you said something that -- I

21 was surprised, if it's conceded. I thought it wasn't

22 conceded -- tell me if I'm wrong -- that the States

23 have water quality standards. Those water quality

24 standards may or may not have something to do with

25 point source discharges. They don't have to. They

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 want water to be good enough for recreation. They want

2 water without algae so there are more fish. They have

3 a lot of things. And this statute seems to say the F-

4 -- what used to be the FPC. I -- is it now FERC?

5 MR. KAYATTA: Yes, it is, Your Honor.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay -- used to be the

7 Federal Power Commission -- tells them, "You have to

8 get approval to build your dam. And we're not going to

9 give you approval unless you comply with State water

10 quality standards." This seems to me to go back into

11 ancient history, like 1920. And of course you have to

12 comply. And so, isn't the purpose of -- is there

13 agreement that it only concerns point discharges, or

14 does it concern water quality standards?

15 MR. KAYATTA: The consistent position of the

16 EPA all along has been that 401 requires a discharge

17 from a point source before it applies.

18 JUSTICE BREYER: Really?

19 MR. KAYATTA: Yes.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words -- discharge

21 from a point source, what is -- well, then EPA concedes

22 you win?

23 MR. KAYATTA: No. EPA is claiming that the

24 discharge from a point source occurs as the water exits

25 the dam --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, fine.

2 MR. KAYATTA: -- not in the --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: So, what's --

4 MR. KAYATTA: -- impoundment.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: -- the problem? So, they're

6 saying, as I thought was true since 1920, that you're

7 going to get your dam only if you comply with State

8 standards, including standards about fish, algae, junk

9 in the water, all kinds of things that might be put

10 there by the dam.

11 MR. KAYATTA: Well, the -- 401 is a

12 triggering, or a threshold determination, as set forth

13 in one of this Court's prior decisions, that gives the

14 State not just a voice, but essentially a mandatory

15 veto over a very broad area. The question in this case

16 is, have we triggered -- have we stepped over that

17 threshold? The point that there is no disagreement

18 between the parties on is that to step over that

19 threshold, to trigger 401, one has to have a discharge

20 into the navigable waters --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. And they're saying,

22 "Of course there is a discharge. The discharge is a

23 discharge of water." Okay? The water runs into it.

24 Now, that's enough for you to have to comply with the

25 State standards before the F- -- FERC is going to give

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you a license.

2 MR. KAYATTA: No, their position is precisely

3 that the water is running into the water.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, have you got anything -

5 - I've heard you argue about the word "discharge"; and

6 you say "discharge" doesn't mean "discharge of water,"

7 it means something else. And I think that's a very

8 logical argument. Is there any other argument that

9 you'd have, related to the purpose of the statute for

10 the objective?

11 MR. KAYATTA: Yes. Let me refer to the

12 purpose. There's -- as is always the case, there are

13 general pronouncements about purpose. And the

14 Respondents have taken those general pronouncements to

15 basically say, "Anything that allows the States greater

16 control or improvement over water quality is the

17 direction in which the statute should be interpreted,

18 to achieve that general purpose." However, we know

19 that, notwithstanding the general purposes, that

20 Congress, when it turned to approve specific words in

21 401, did not simply say "anything that affects water

22 quality." It divided a line. And that line, for

23 example, means that Federal permits for grazing, or

24 Federal permits for logging roads, do not trigger 401;

25 and they do not trigger it, because there is no

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 discharge from a point source.

2 So, we know a line has been drawn by Congress

3 in pursuit of its purpose, as compared to other goals

4 that Congress has in mind. The question is, Where was

5 that line drawn? We think you look to the statute to

6 see where that was drawn, and it was "discharge into

7 the navigable waters." Otherwise, what we're left with

8 is, we're left with trying to, sort of, almost

9 metaphysically think of the water discharge -- the same

10 water discharging into the same water in order to reach

11 a conclusion that the real way you should read the

12 statute is just as if it says, "If one does anything at

13 all to the water, you need to get certification." And

14 we don't think it says that. It would --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Counsel, I keep

16 thinking of this example, and I want you to comment on

17 it. Out West, of course, there are a lot of dams where

18 there are salmon in the -- in the river, going down,

19 and a lot of salmon get killed if they go through the -

20 - through the dam, so that the water before the dam has

21 live salmon, and the water after that has dead salmon.

22 And say that happened in Maine. Would that be

23 a discharge if that happened?

24 MR. KAYATTA: The --

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: If there were live fish --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KAYATTA: Yes.

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- above the dam, and they

3 all -- they get killed going through the dam, and they

4 were dead when they --

5 MR. KAYATTA: Yes.

6 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- came out, would that be

7 a discharge in --

8 MR. KAYATTA: Actually, the record here would

9 indicate that that -- that could happen with some eels,

10 not salmon.

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

12 MR. KAYATTA: So, your point is well taken,

13 Justice Stevens. The fish that, as the water flows

14 through the dam, may be killed by coming in contact

15 with, and getting hit by, the turbine, are not

16 discharged into the water; they're in the water as it

17 goes into the dam, they're killed as it goes through

18 the dam, they remain in the water. The dam discharges

19 nothing. It puts nothing --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: So, you would say --

21 MR. KAYATTA: -- into the river.

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- even in that case, that

23 would not be a statutory discharge.

24 MR. KAYATTA: That's correct, Your Honor. We

25 think that --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you don't

2 dispute that FERC could impose the same conditions that

3 Maine has imposed in this case, as a matter of FERC

4 authority.

5 MR. KAYATTA: Exactly. And we would --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could they even

7 impose something in the condition to your hydroelectric

8 power license saying, "You must comply with State water

9 quality standards"?

10 MR. KAYATTA: I think they could -- I'm not

11 sure they could word it that way, but they could

12 effectively -- FERC could effectively do it. In

13 effect, Congress has told FERC that in a -- in a

14 Federal -- in a FERC proceeding, it not only has to

15 listen to the State, but it has to give considerable

16 consideration to the State's arguments. And it has to

17 --

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you're concerned

19 about conditions -- I mean, as a practical matter, in

20 terms of how the result in this case would change

21 things, it's a question of whether FERC has to more or

22 less accept what the State does, or whether FERC simply

23 considers and decides whether it wants to impose those

24 conditions.

25 MR. KAYATTA: That's correct. And it's a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 very substantial issue, because essentially what FERC

2 proceedings are -- under the hydropower sections of

3 FERC, essentially what they are is environmental

4 proceedings, where there's a determination made about

5 water quality issues that are then balanced off against

6 energy issues. If the -- under prior interpretations,

7 the 401 powers have become quite robust. If we now

8 take the threshold of "discharge into the navigable

9 waters," and interpret that in a way so it essentially

10 applies in all situations, FERC proceedings essentially

11 will be a mail office, where they receive the

12 conditions from the State and have no choice but to

13 file them -- follow them. Our position is that

14 Congress intended to leave some room --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would rather be

16 regulated more aggressively by FERC than by the Maine

17 Board of Environmental Protection.

18 MR. KAYATTA: That's correct. It would have

19 a uniform national energy and environmental policy, in

20 that respect. And we believe that -- Congress, in '86,

21 clearly thought that's what we had. That's the -- it

22 would make no sense, in Congress in '86, to order FERC

23 to give weight to what the States say in these

24 situations if what we're now told is, "Congress was

25 wasting your time, because the States already had a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 mandatory veto on all of these issue -- issues in every

2 single situation with respect to every single

3 hydropower licensing" --

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does FERC --

5 MR. KAYATTA: -- "proceeding."

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- as a regulator,

7 tend to give greater priority to power considerations,

8 as opposed to local environmental concerns?

9 MR. KAYATTA: There was some concern prior to

10 '86 by Congress that FERC was doing just that. And

11 that's why Congress told, in 1986, long after the

12 statute was passed, that FERC has to make specific

13 findings if it disagrees with the State. Additionally,

14 Congress gave to the Department of Interior, under

15 section 18, certain powers to dictate to FERC, for

16 example, fish passages. FERC has no choice on those.

17 So, Congress -- this reference to cooperative

18 federalism clearly was in Congress's mind, but it

19 wasn't a cooperative federalism in which, on all issues

20 in all proceedings, all the State needed to do is tell

21 FERC what to do. But they --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but it doesn't -- it

23 doesn't say -- it says they have to comply with State

24 water quality standards, doesn't it?

25 MR. KAYATTA: It doesn't -- Congress did not

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 order, in 1986, FERC to always comply in all situations

2 --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I thought -- it says

4 that you have to get your permit. You have to be

5 compliant with State water quality standards. Now,

6 suppose a State has a nutty water quality standard.

7 Doesn't EPA have some authority there to make sure that

8 a water quality standard of a State, under the Clean

9 Water Act, is -- makes sense?

10 MR. KAYATTA: Well, EPA has some authority

11 with respect to any State water quality standards that

12 are less stringent than EPO's -- EPA's own

13 requirements. It's not clear that EPA, under the Act,

14 has the ability to go beyond that. Moreover, it's --

15 if --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, if a State

17 were to say, "Our water quality standard is the

18 following. We never build a dam in our State, no

19 matter what." Okay? Now, there's no authority in the

20 EPA to set that aside as it not being a proper Clean

21 Water Act standard.

22 MR. KAYATTA: If this decision is --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: It has to be just a Clean

24 Water Act standard.

25 MR. KAYATTA: Yes.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not an expert on the

2 Clean Water Act. Is that a proper Clean Water Act

3 standard?

4 MR. KAYATTA: If this decision is affirmed,

5 then you will have precisely held --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: No, this decision -- I'm not

7 asking you about this decision. I'm asking you if a

8 State, under the Clean Water Act, were to say, "We have

9 the following Clean" -- now you understand what I'm --

10 MR. KAYATTA: Yes.

11 JUSTICE BREYER: Does EPA, or anyone else,

12 have authority to say, "That isn't a proper Clean Water

13 Act standard, however good you may think it is"?

14 MR. KAYATTA: I don't know, Justice Breyer,

15 about the wording posed in your hypothetical, so I

16 can't answer the wording. I can say this, that

17 effectively the States can do precisely that by simply

18 saying, "We want the river water quality to be like X,

19 and X is inconsistent with there being any dam at all

20 on the river." So, indeed, if this decision is

21 affirmed, it truly does mean that States can entirely

22 dictate everything having to do with any environmental

23 aspects of dams, including to the point of requiring

24 that the dams not operate; and FERC can do nothing

25 about it. We do -- we do not see how that would leave

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 any sense of cooperative federalism, and it would tell

2 Congress, "In 1986, you were just entirely wasting your

3 time, because you had already, in '72, given them the

4 power to control everything."

5 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, has FERC said that this

6 is a problem, that the States are interfering?

7 MR. KAYATTA: Well, FERC has sort of been all

8 over the place. They're sort of the odd man out,

9 because it's their jurisdiction that's being taken

10 away; and yet we're talking about a Clean Water Act

11 case where EPA is the agency defined with that Act.

12 FERC has argued to the courts, on several occasions,

13 that 401 needs to be limited to discharge of

14 pollutants. FERC, at one point, the first several dam

15 proceedings that came up, it didn't even require

16 certifications at all. It then promulgated

17 certification requirements that said, "Either get a

18 certification or otherwise comply with the law." And

19 then, in the interim period, it is simply -- as we've

20 been affected, simply said, "Go get your

21 certifications." It then tried to say, "But we can do

22 something about it if we don't like them." And the

23 Circuit Courts, at least one, has said, "No, you

24 can't."

25 And when 401 applies, as this Court found in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Public Utility Districts versus Jefferson, it is a

2 robust power. It is an awesome power that is given to

3 the States under 401. And to -- giving that power

4 greatly cabined-in FERC's authority to now extend that

5 power automatically to any conduct that in any way

6 "touches on the water" by turning "touches on the

7 water" or "moving the water" into "discharge into the

8 water" -- effectively wipes out that balance entirely.

9 I would note, too, that we don't even -- we

10 can answer all of this without even getting into those

11 by going back to the statute. We have a statute here

12 that uses the word "discharge," in one form or another,

13 on 421 occasions in 37 different sections of the

14 statute. With the exception of the section that deals

15 with the discharge of employees -- not into the river -

16 - and the discharge --

17 [Laughter.]

18 MR. KAYATTA: -- and the discharge of board

19 duties, in every single one of those instances, as you

20 thumb through the statute, Congress is always clearly

21 talking about "putting something into the water."

22 There is no doubt. On the one occasion in the statute

23 --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I don't

25 understand, linguistically, why this isn't "putting

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 something into the water," to the extent the dam holds

2 back and restrains the water, then it "puts back into

3 the water" the water that it had held back.

4 MR. KAYATTA: Well, the water slows down,

5 meanders around, as it would in an eddy, and continues

6 on through the dam, down the river. If you take a

7 water molecule, it comes down, goes through and out.

8 If -- unless you get --

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Here's -- I'm

10 thinking of the Hoover Dam, and it's got these huge,

11 you know, discharge points.

12 MR. KAYATTA: Yes.

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And every now and

14 then they let the water come out. Isn't that a

15 discharge?

16 MR. KAYATTA: The -- I would say, in an

17 ordinary dictionary definition, if you stand below the

18 Hoover Dam and look up at it, you would say, "Water is

19 emitting from the dam. Water is discharging from the

20 dam," in an ordinary dictionary definition. I would

21 agree with that.

22 What I'm saying, though, is that if you keep

23 in mind that it's not a reservoir emitting into a

24 river, but it's a single river flowing through the dam,

25 that water is not "discharging into" that water.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 That's what we're saying.

2 JUSTICE ALITO: Would it be fair to say that,

3 let's say, the Missouri River discharges into the

4 Mississippi? Is that consistent with ordinary usage?

5 MR. KAYATTA: If you have two water bodies,

6 then you could have one discharging into the other.

7 Yes, Your Honor.

8 JUSTICE ALITO: But they're two water bodies,

9 only because people gave them two different names.

10 MR. KAYATTA: Well, in Miccosukee, the Court

11 actually go into that and set forth -- in fact,

12 remanded the case to decide whether the aquifer was one

13 water body or two. If you look at that remand, it's

14 absolutely clear that this water body, under any

15 standard discussed in that opinion, would be a single

16 water body. And the United States agrees with us on

17 that. The United States agrees we're talking about a

18 single water body here.

19 JUSTICE ALITO: But the --

20 MR. KAYATTA: And I could --

21 JUSTICE ALITO: -- the statute doesn't say

22 "discharge from one water body into another water

23 body." It says "discharge into the navigable waters."

24 MR. KAYATTA: Yes.

25 JUSTICE ALITO: And if the portion of the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 river below the dam is a navigable water, why is there

2 not a pouring forth of the water into the navigable

3 waters below the dam?

4 MR. KAYATTA: Well, if one thinks of upstream

5 waters and downstream waters, it -- our view is that

6 upstream waters simply become downstream waters as they

7 flow through the dam. One doesn't discharge into

8 another.

9 I would -- I would concede that very bright

10 people working very hard with virtually any words in

11 the English language can find some way to reach a point

12 to say that perhaps something fits something. But, at

13 some point -- at some point, I think we need to ask, is

14 -- if Congress uses the same word throughout the

15 statute to always mean putting something into water,

16 then how do we get to the conclusion that what that

17 really means is doing anything to the water is always -

18 - because --

19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't --

20 MR. KAYATTA: -- the --

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- isn't the answer to your

22 question that a great number of those usages that you

23 refer to are uses that refer to the discharge of

24 pollutants? And there is a good -- there are good

25 reasons in the statute -- and we have recognized them -

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 - to say that when you discharge a pollutant, you are

2 adding something that wasn't there before? But when

3 the statute, in this case, is using "discharge" without

4 a reference to "pollutant," it makes perfectly good

5 linguistic sense to construe it just as the Court has

6 done.

7 MR. KAYATTA: Well it makes -- it is

8 linguistically logical to say that we're, therefore,

9 going to assume that a pollutant is not needed here.

10 But when Congress has replaced the "discharge of a

11 pollutant" with a "discharge into," it seems to me

12 Congress has actually moved in the other direction of

13 reinforcing that we're talking about --

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe it's --

15 MR. KAYATTA: -- putting something into the

16 water.

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- "reinforcing," and maybe

18 it's "changing." I mean, you're characterizing it one

19 way. We start with a different canon of meaning, and

20 that is that we look to the words around which, in

21 connection with which, the word is used. In here, it's

22 being used without certain modifiers or descriptive

23 conditions. In other cases, it is being used with

24 them. And that's a good reason to think that probably

25 the word is intended to mean something different in

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 those situations.

2 MR. KAYATTA: Well, I would -- I would

3 hesitate, Justice Souter, to go from taking a specific

4 word, like "discharge," and, therefore, saying that it

5 meant something that is both more general and much more

6 easily set.

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but your argument, I

8 thought, was simply this, that it uses "discharge" in,

9 you know, X number -- I forget how many you had -- and

10 it's perfectly clear that in most of those instances it

11 requires an addition; and, therefore, it should be

12 construed as requiring it here. My point was that in a

13 great many of those instances, the statute is not

14 merely using the word in isolation; it's using it in

15 connection with a couple of other words, like

16 "discharge a pollutant." And it, therefore, number

17 one, makes sense to construe "discharge of a pollutant"

18 differently from "discharge." That's the -- that's the

19 only point.

20 MR. KAYATTA: Yes.

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: The only point is, you can't

22 simply argue from the fact that the word occurs somehow

23 X number of times to the conclusion that it has to mean

24 the same thing every time it's used.

25 MR. KAYATTA: I agree with you. And my point

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 is, I am including instances not just in which

2 "pollutant" is used. A whole variety. And, in every

3 single one of those, its common -- and I would submit

4 that the word itself, when you use the word "into,"

5 naturally suggests -- in fact, why would someone use

6 the phrase "discharge into the navigable waters" if

7 what they really meant was, "If you do anything to the

8 navigable waters at all, you've got to get a permit"?

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Because that isn't what they

10 mean. I mean, for example, if somebody puts a stick in

11 the middle of the river, no one -- no one is claiming

12 that the water that flows around the stick is being

13 discharged. I mean, there are a lot -- I don't know

14 whether anyone wants to put a stick in the river, but -

15 -

16 MR. KAYATTA: Yes.

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- there are things you can

18 do that clearly would not activate the Corps'

19 interpretation here.

20 MR. KAYATTA: I -- this logic, I think, would

21 probably include virtually anything you do to the

22 water, because it would separate the water, the water

23 going around the stick. One would then say the

24 dictionary definition means it's then discharging back

25 into itself on the other side of the stick. There

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 would be, perhaps, no water quality concerns, but 401

2 doesn't say "water quality concerns"; it says

3 "discharge into."

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Would you agree that if the

5 -- if somebody with property on each side wanted to

6 build a dam -- I'm sorry, wanted to build a bridge to

7 connect his property, and he needed to put a post in

8 the middle of the river to support the bridge, that

9 there would be no discharge of water occasioned by

10 putting the post in there?

11 MR. KAYATTA: Under the Government's

12 interpretation, there would be. There would be a

13 discharge into the navigable waters in that situation.

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why, if -- you may answer.

15 MR. KAYATTA: Because the post -- to put --

16 well, in the first place, putting the post in might,

17 itself, be a -- what we could concede to be a

18 discharge. In the second case, though, is that we

19 understand that you would be exercising control over

20 the flow and direction of that water, it would separate

21 the river into two portions -- of course, small. But

22 if we're pursuing this line of logic that the

23 Government has to its final extent, it would then

24 discharge back into itself on the other side of that

25 post.

2 General Rowe?

3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. STEVEN ROWE

4 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

5 MR. ROWE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

6 please the Court:

7 The flow of water through Petitioner's dams

8 into the Presumpscot River is a discharge, under

9 section 401(a) of the Clean Water Act. This finding is

10 supported by the plain text of section 401(a), the

11 purpose, the history, and the structure of the Clean

12 Water Act, in more than 30 years of administrative

13 practice and agency interpretation. Under the Clean

14 Water Act, Congress --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a --

16 MR. ROWE: -- requires --

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a discharge

18 if you have a simple waterwheel in the river? Is that

19 a discharge?

20 MR. ROWE: Well, first of all, Your Honor,

21 for 401 to apply there must be a federally licensed

22 activity. In that case --

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, so it's a old

24 hydroelectric plant, it uses a simple waterwheel. I

25 mean, is that -- does that fit your definition of a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 "discharge"? In other words, it restrains the water

2 temporarily.

3 MR. ROWE: Yes, Your Honor.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then it releases

5 it again as it passes by the wheel.

6 MR. ROWE: Yes, Your Honor. It --

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if you put a

8 waterwheel in a flowing river, under your definition,

9 that's a discharge into the navigable water.

10 MR. ROWE: It could, Your Honor. It could

11 discharge. It depends on the actual circumstances.

12 Obviously, under the doctrine of de minimis non curat

13 lex, it may not pose any problems, and it wouldn't be

14 an issue. But certainly to the extent that it used the

15 water and then it discharged the water, there was

16 emitting out or flowing out.

17 If you put a fishnet in the river, there would be

18 no discharge. Justice Souter's example of a simple --

19 a post, probably no discharge. But if you put a

20 hundred-foot -- a post 100 foot in diameter into a 200-

21 foot-wide river, then you may have a discharge. So,

22 Your Honor, I would suggest it depends on the

23 circumstances. But, remember, 401 does require it to

24 be a federally licensed project.

25 The point I was going to make, Your Honor, is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that, under the Clean Water Act, Congress requires

2 States to adopt clean water standards --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I must say, this --

4 MR. ROWE: -- water quality standards.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- this doesn't seem to me

6 normal usage. I don't think if -- you know, if you see

7 a rapids in a river, it would be strange to say the

8 rapids of the Colorado "discharge" into the Colorado.

9 You're usually talking about a different body of water.

10 You could say the Green River discharges into the

11 Colorado. Likewise, a waterfall, you wouldn't say, you

12 know, "The waterfall on this river discharges into the

13 river." It's part of the river. But if it were a

14 waterfall that brought a tributary into the river, you

15 would then say that, you know, "the waterfall

16 discharges into the Colorado," or whatever river it

17 enters at that point. It seems to me very strange to

18 talk about a river discharging into itself.

19 MR. ROWE: Justice Scalia, it's not strange

20 at all. It's not -- it's discharging from the activity

21 into the river. The water goes into the activity. The

22 activity, in this case, is a -- an impoundment. There

23 are five impoundments. These dams create impoundments.

24 One's 197 acres --

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that doesn't --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 but that --

2 MR. ROWE: -- in size.

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that doesn't

4 matter to your analysis. It's the one post, right? I

5 mean, if you have just sort of a foot indentation on

6 either side, would -- the flows, in -- under your view,

7 suddenly becomes a discharge.

8 MR. ROWE: Your Honor, my point is, that's

9 not the case we have. We're talking about a

10 hydroelectric dam here.

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but --

12 MR. ROWE: But --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- we're trying to --

14 MR. ROWE: But --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- define --

16 MR. ROWE: I understand, Your Honor.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- a statutory term

18 that's going to apply in a wide variety of cases.

19 MR. ROWE: Yes. In that case, Your Honor,

20 I've said it could cause a discharge -- if the flow was

21 interrupted, the flow regimen of the river, to such an

22 extent that it -- that it increased, substantially, the

23 flow on one side, and that was a federally licensed

24 activity, then 401 would apply. It would be a

25 discharge from the activity.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Now, I'm -- again, I'm using the de minimis

2 rule here. But what we have here, Your Honors, is a

3 dam, we have the water being diverted into a power

4 canal, then dropping down onto the top of the turbines.

5 The turbines are using the water, they're taking the

6 energy from the water to turn the turbine, and then the

7 water is being released.

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, what's --

9 MR. ROWE: It's being discharged.

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, what's the definition -

11 - what's the general definition that you're giving us

12 that describes this result you've given?

13 MR. ROWE: Justice --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It --

15 MR. ROWE: -- Kennedy --

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It is a discharge, because

17 a "discharge" means what?

18 MR. ROWE: It means a flowing or issuing out.

19 It's the -- it is the dictionary definition. Mr.

20 Kayatta mentioned the Hoover Dam. It is that. That's

21 what it is. It's the --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the --

23 MR. ROWE: -- ordinary definition.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the issue is not whether

25 there is a discharge, as I see it.  The issue is

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 whether there's a "discharge into the river." And one

2 does not usually speak of the "river discharging into

3 itself." That -- it's the "into" that's the crucial

4 part. How do you distinguish this case from

5 Miccosukee, if I'm saying it right? -- yes, Miccosukee

6 --

7 MR. ROWE: Well, Your Honor, Miccosukee --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- where we had, you know, a

9 pumping of water from one polluted body into another,

10 and it was held -- we held that that was not a

11 discharge?

12 MR. ROWE: Your Honor, the -- in Miccosukee,

13 that was a section 402 case.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: It --

15 MR. ROWE: It dealt with discharge of a

16 pollutant.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.

18 MR. ROWE: And this --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the crucial --

20 MR. ROWE: -- Court held --

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- word was "discharge."

22 The reason we held it was not covered is not because

23 there was no pollutant. It was clear that there was a

24 pollutant. But we held there was no discharge.

25 MR. ROWE: No, Your Honor, you held that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there was no discharge of the pollutant. You held that

2 it was --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because there was no

4 discharge of a pollutant. There were pollutants in -

5 - on both sides. That -- I think that was conceded in

6 the case. The reason that the case came out the way it

7 did was that we held there was no discharge of a

8 pollutant.

9 MR. ROWE: But there -- Your Honor -- Your

10 Honor, in that case, it required a discharge of a

11 pollutant from a point source. The definition of

12 "discharge" in section 401 is much broader.

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't it conceded that

14 there was a pollutant -- that a pollutant was involved

15 in that case?

16 MR. ROWE: Your -- yes, Your Honor, but the -

17 -

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, what must have been the

19 difference was that there was no discharge.

20 MR. ROWE: There was no discharge of a

21 pollutant, Your Honor.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: There was no discharge of

23 anything. It was clear that if there was a -- if there

24 was a discharge, it was a discharge of a pollutant.

25 MR. ROWE: Your Honor, in -- with all due

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 respect, in that case -- and, in that case, you joined

2 Justice Thomas in saying, "The term 'discharge' is not

3 defined in the Clean Water Act, but its plain and

4 ordinary meaning suggests a flowing or issuing out, or

5 something that is emitted." In the case we have here,

6 something is emitted. It is water. It is emitted

7 from a facility. We have a federally licensed

8 facility. And out of the turbines comes water, and it

9 flows into the river. Miccosukee was a 402 case, Your

10 Honor, with all due respect.

11 And, in another point, I --

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Didn't -- didn't that case

13 involved the -- a violation there -- involve the

14 addition of a pollutant? And there was no addition of

15 a pollutant, because the water was equally polluted on

16 each side. Wasn't that the --

17 MR. ROWE: That's --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the case?

19 MR. ROWE: That's correct, Your Honor.

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

21 MR. ROWE: The pollutant was already in the

22 water when it -- when it entered -- the water from the

23 pipe. And the point that Justice Ginsburg's mentioned,

24 the quote, is, if one takes a ladle of soup from a pot,

25 lifts it up above the pot and pours it back into the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 pot, one has not added soup or anything else to the

2 pot. Section 401, the word "discharge" in that section

3 does not require an addition of anything. It can be --

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then -- but

5 your focus -- in response to my question about what

6 would constitute release, you focused on the fact of

7 impoundment, a restriction of the flow. It seems to me

8 that the ladle analogy that the Court has made part of

9 the law of the land is -- refutes that, because if it's

10 hold -- you're holding it up in the ladle, that's like

11 an impoundment. You've separated it, to that extent,

12 from the other body, and the Court said, when you pour

13 it back in, that's not --

14 MR. ROWE: It wasn't --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that's not a

16 discharge of a pollutant --

17 MR. ROWE: No, Mr. Chief --

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and there was no

19 dispute that there were pollutants, so it must mean it

20 wasn't a discharge.

21 MR. ROWE: Mr. Chief Justice, the Court

22 didn't say that there was no discharge; the Court said

23 that there was no addition of soup or anything else

24 into the pot. The point is, there was not the addition

25 of a pollutant. And you do not need the addition of a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 pollutant to find a discharge, under section 401.

2 I just want to remind the Court that section

3 401 came from section 21(b) of the Water Quality

4 Improvement Act of 1970. That was the old section 401.

5 It said, "Anytime that there's a licensed activity

6 that's going to create a discharge from a facility into

7 navigable waters, then the States are to enforce their

8 water quality standards." Congress requires States to

9 adopt water quality standards, according to section

10 303. And we have. All States have. And those water

11 quality standards are consistent. We have designated

12 uses, water quality criteria, and an antidegradation

13 policy.

14 The Court should know that, as part of our

15 designated uses, hydropower is one of those. The State

16 values hydropower. We understand the importance of it.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you --

18 MR. ROWE: Most --

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you don't -- you

20 don't value it as much as FERC does, though, do you?

21 MR. ROWE: Your Honor, I don't know.

22 [Laughter.]

23 MR. ROWE: You heard -- Your Honor, you heard

24 earlier --

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, isn't one way

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to look at this -- I mean, the concern is that your

2 constituents probably have a higher priority and a

3 greater concern with the environmental consequences of

4 generating power, while FERC's priority is to make sure

5 that we have sufficient power. And you're likely to

6 weigh these competing uses in very different ways.

7 MR. ROWE: Well, Your Honor, you heard

8 earlier about the -- 1986, the Electric Consumers

9 Protection Act. That did require FERC to give equal

10 consideration to the protection of the environment with

11 respect to the production of -- hydropower production.

12 But the States have a responsibility given to them by

13 Congress. The States have the primary responsibility

14 for the prevention, for the reduction, and for the

15 elimination of pollution. The way we enforce that is

16 through our water quality standards. And so, the only

17 way we can enforce those standards with respect to

18 federally licensed facilities is section 401. And if

19 you should take that from us, it will create a gaping

20 hole in the Clean Water Act.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, only if you assume

22 that letting out the same water into the same river is

23 pollution. It seems to me you're begging the question.

24 MR. ROWE: Your Honor --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: You --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ROWE: -- the --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: If there were a discharge of

3 something into the river, you'd be able to move against

4 it. But the question here is whether there's any

5 discharge into the river when you stop the river and

6 then let the same river out.

7 MR. ROWE: Your Honor, the "pollution," as

8 defined in the Clean Water Act, is the alteration of

9 the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of the

10 water. That's the pollution.

11 The reason 401 exists, and the reason

12 "discharge" is used broadly, and it's the trigger for

13 the section to work, is because you look at the impacts

14 of that activity on the environment. You look at the

15 physical integrity -- Has it been altered? -- the

16 chemical integrity, the biological integrity. We look

17 at things like the impact on aquatic ecosystems, the

18 thermal stratification in the impoundment areas,

19 whether there is lower dissolved oxygen. And certainly

20 we look at the fish migration issues. Has there been

21 blockage?

22 JUSTICE ALITO: Could you, as Justice

23 Breyer's question to your adversary suggested, adopt

24 water quality standards that would make any

25 hydroelectric power impossible, in Maine?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ROWE: Your Honor, we could. We have a

2 number of classes of rivers. With respect to one

3 class, that is not a designated use. With respect to

4 all the others, hydropower is the designated use.

5 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that's something

6 that Congress intended when they adopted this, to allow

7 a State to rule out hydroelectric power?

8 MR. ROWE: Justice Alito, Congress did not

9 give the States unbounded authority. Indeed, in

10 section 401(d), there is a restriction. It restricts

11 the conditions to those necessary to assure that the

12 applicant will comply with conditions in our water

13 quality standards. And if -- I mean, FERC does

14 incorporate those standards into the license, but the

15 applicant can redress that in court, as this one has.

16 So, we -- I want to mention, again, that States care

17 about hydropower. We care about fish migration. We

18 care about recreation activities. We care about all of

19 these things, and they're all incorporated into our

20 water quality standards.

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, I take it your ultimate

22 answer is, no, a State could not, in effect, eliminate

23 hydropower from --

24 MR. ROWE: Well, Your --

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- development.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. ROWE: -- Your Honor, in our State it's a

2 designated use --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry --

4 MR. ROWE: -- on most of our rivers.

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not interested -- I'm

6 asking for an answer to my question. I take it, based

7 on your further answer to Justice Alito, that your

8 answer to the first question is, no, a State could not,

9 in effect, eliminate all hydropower from -- development

10 from its rivers.

11 MR. ROWE: Your -- Justice Souter, a State --

12 a State could do that if it changed the designated uses

13 for its rivers. But in the State of Maine, as in 45

14 States --

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: And you don't think there

16 would be any conflict with the FERC scheme if you did

17 that? You don't think there would be any conflict

18 between the Federal policy embodied in the Power Act

19 and in the State law?

20 MR. ROWE: Well, Your Honor, again, I want to

21 -- under the Clean Water Act, the States have primary

22 responsibility for the reduction and for the

23 elimination and --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I --

25 MR. ROWE: -- prevention of pollution.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I think the question --

2 maybe it just -- I don't understand, totally, how the

3 Clean Water Act works, but I thought that what we're

4 talking in this statute is a State rule that's called

5 the State Clean Water Act rule. It's a creature of the

6 Clean Water Act, isn't it? A water quality standard?

7 MR. ROWE: Yes, Your Honor.

8 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And, therefore,

9 a State, I would think, that had some totally bizarre

10 Clean Water Act standard might find that it had a

11 standard that didn't fit within the scope of the Clean

12 Water Act. And, therefore, it wasn't going to be

13 enforced here. Is that right, or not right? Maybe the

14 Federal Government will explain this --

15 MR. ROWE: Well, Your Honor, I'm sure the

16 Federal Government will also address this question, but

17 the parameters of the water quality standards are

18 addressed in section 303 of the Clean Water Act. And

19 there are parameters in there. And the States' Clean

20 Water -- or water quality standards must conform to

21 those standards. We submit our Clean -- our water

22 quality standards --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are they maximums or

24 minimums?

25 MR. ROWE: Your Honor, it's simply categories

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in there. We submit --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I expect that they're

3 minimums.

4 MR. ROWE: We -- well, they are minimums,

5 Your Honor. We submit these to the EPA. The EPA

6 approves the State water quality standards, and then

7 those standards are how we evaluate these federally

8 licensed activities as to whether they're in compliance

9 or not. And they determine the certification, whether

10 it's issued, and if it's issued, with what conditions.

11 If a State -- if a State's rivers were not conducive

12 to hydropower -- the question you asked, Your Honor was

13 -- Justice Souter -- could a State prevent hydropower

14 from occurring? Again, we have, with respect to a few

15 rivers in the State of Maine; but most of the rivers,

16 it is a designated use, because States, like the

17 Federal Government, value hydropower. There is no air

18 pollution. It's a clean source of energy. We value

19 it. And, indeed, the antidegradation policies that are

20 part of our water quality standards require us to look

21 at the impact on Petitioner's dams, the power output

22 that's going to be -- going to -- is going to result

23 from these various conditions that we impose as a part

24 of our certification.

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: General Rowe, may I ask

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 this question? In the Miccosukee case, we sent the

2 case back, as you remember, to decide whether or not

3 there were one body of water or two bodies of water.

4 In your view, are there one or two bodies of water --

5 would it be five bodies of water -- in this case?

6 MR. ROWE: There's one body of water, Your

7 Honor -- Justice Stevens.

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: So, you --

9 MR. ROWE: And that's the --

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- concede that.

11 MR. ROWE: -- that's the --

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.

13 MR. ROWE: -- Presumpscot River.

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

15 MR. ROWE: All the water is waters of the

16 United States, navigable waters, but the water is being

17 discharged from the facility into the navigable waters.

18 You -- Your Honor has mentioned a storage dam. A

19 storage dam creates an impoundment. In fact, one of

20 these dams has a 50-foot-high wall that holds the water

21 back, almost 200 acres of water. At times, there is

22 water that goes over the top of the dam. That is,

23 indeed, a discharge. It is caused by the activity. It

24 results from the activity. It's not the free-flowing

25 water. And I want to make that clear. I think,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Justice Scalia, your question was -- that's not a

2 discharge. That's a natural flow of water. What's

3 happening here is, the flow is being altered. Because

4 of the impoundment, because of the diversion, the flow

5 is being altered. And in the case at hand here, you're

6 actually taking a turbine, the water drops down into

7 the turbine, turns the turbine blades or fans, it

8 absorbs the water of its power, and then the water is

9 released, discharged, into the tailrace channel, into

10 the natural river.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, any significant

12 obstruction in the river amounts to a -- creates a

13 discharge.

14 MR. ROWE: No, I'd -- no, Your --

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, if it's a small

16 enough stream, I suppose just swimming in it or lying

17 sideways so you impede the flow, you are causing a

18 discharge into the waters of the United States. I find

19 that peculiar.

20 MR. ROWE: That -- Justice Scalia, that's not

21 what I said. The question was asked about a post, like

22 a bridge, the pilings for a bridge. In certain cases,

23 depending on the size, it might result in a discharge.

24 I'm not saying every -- a stick in the river is,

25 certainly not a swimmer. We have a de minimis rule.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 We're not saying that. It needs to be --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it depends on how big

3 the river is, doesn't it?

4 MR. ROWE: Well, I'm -- if it's navigable

5 waters, and you have a huge post that's holding up a

6 bridge, there could be a -- there -- and it's federally

7 licensed -- there could be a discharge resulting from

8 that. I mean, I -- that is what a person would say,

9 "There is a discharge," because suddenly you see --

10 where water was naturally flowing, you see a diversion,

11 in an impoundment, of sorts, moving the water over.

12 But what we have here is not that case. What we have

13 here is an impoundment. We have the water being

14 diverted into a narrow channel, dropping down onto

15 these turbines, being used, and then being discharged

16 into the river.

17 The word "discharge," again, in 1970, under the

18 21(b), was given a broad definition. 402 and 404 came

19 later, in 1972, as part of the Clean Water Act. In

20 those, we're dealing with discrete conveyances of

21 pollutants, 402. And 404 was dredge or fill discharge.

22 And those were deemed necessary. But they're consumed

23 in 401. In other words, if you get a 402, if you need

24 a 40- -- a 402 application, certification, you also

25 will need a 401. 401 deals with the effects of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 pollution, the effects of the activity on the

2 environment.

3 I thank Your Honors very much. And I just

4 want to remind the Court that the State very much

5 values the power -- the importance of hydropower. We

6 value the -- our responsibility, as given to us by

7 Congress under the Clean Water Act, to be the primary

8 enforcer of our water quality standards. And the only

9 way we can do that, with respect to federally licensed

10 facilities, is section 401.

11 Thank you very much.

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General

13 Rowe.

14 Mr. Minear.

15 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

16 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

17 IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT

18 MR. MINEAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19 please the Court:

20 The United States submits that the operation

21 of Petitioner's hydropower facilities results in a

22 discharge into the navigable waters within the meaning

23 of section 401 of the Clean Water Act. section 401

24 uses the term "discharge" in its ordinary sense to mean

25 a "flowing out" or "issuing out." The facilities at

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 issue in this case, which divert water, impound it, and

2 then release it, produce a flowing or issuing out of

3 that water into the navigable Presumpscot River.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Section 402 uses "discharge"

5 in the same sense, I assume.

6 MR. MINEAR: No, it does not, Your Honor.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't it?

8 MR. MINEAR: Because it uses the term

9 "discharge of a pollutant," which is --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes --

11 MR. MINEAR: -- which is defined, under the

12 Clean Water Act, as a statutory term of art, to mean

13 the addition of a pollution -- of a pollutant from a

14 point source. On the other hand, the Clean Water Act

15 interprets or defines "discharge" to include the

16 "discharge of a pollutant." So, it's clear that the

17 term "discharge" is broader than the term "discharge of

18 a pollutant," and does not include the requirement of

19 an addition.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is -- it is broader. But

21 if -- the discharge of a pollutant into the same body

22 of water does not constitute the addition of a

23 pollution -- of a pollutant. It obviously is the

24 addition of a pollutant. The only reason you could say

25 that taking it from one -- pumping it from one polluted

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 body to another is not a discharge of a pollutant,

2 which is what we said in Miccosukee, the only basis for

3 saying that is that there has been no discharge.

4 There's obviously been an addition of a pollutant to

5 the -- to the other body of water. The only thing you

6 can say is, there hasn't been a discharge. It's --

7 because it's the same body of water.

8 MR. MINEAR: I respectfully disagree, Your

9 Honor, because, in Miccosukee, it addressed the

10 specific question of whether or not there is an

11 addition. And, in the much-quoted soup-ladle example,

12 what it was talking about, in that instance, was taking

13 a ladle of soup, removing it from the pot, and adding

14 it back. The pouring back of the soup into the pot is

15 a discharge, it's a flowing or issuing out. It's not

16 an addition, because nothing is being added to the

17 soup.

18 Now, in this case, we're using the term

19 "discharge," not "addition." And there is, obviously,

20 a flowing or issuing out from the dam. Anyone who goes

21 and observes a dam, and sees the water leaving the dam,

22 will say that's a "discharge." That's common parlance.

23 It's been repeated numerous times in this Court's own

24 decisions in describing dam operations.

25 Furthermore --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, Miccosukee

2 was concerned not with molecules, but with chemical

3 composition. The chemical composition was the same in

4 this body and in that body, and, in that sense, there

5 was no addition --

6 MR. MINEAR: That's correct --

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that --

8 MR. MINEAR: -- that there was no

9 transmission.

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

11 MR. MINEAR: But I think, Justice Souter, you

12 are right in focusing on the exiting from the dam and

13 why discharges are important here.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: If, in Miccosukee, liquid of

15 the same composition had been taken from another body

16 of water, and from -- not the body of water that was

17 adjacent and which we held was the same body of water -

18 - with the same composition, and that had been added,

19 do you think Miccosukee would have come out the same

20 way?

21 MR. MINEAR: Yes, I think it would have come

22 out the same way.

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Really? That you could take

24 pollutants from a different body of water and add it to

25 an already polluted stream? I thought that was clear

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that that's not the case.

2 MR. MINEAR: Your Honor, if we look to the

3 Miccosukee opinion, at 541 U.S. 109 to 110, it

4 discusses this issue. One of the issues there is, Are

5 there two bodies of water or one body of water?

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.

7 MR. MINEAR: And the Court -- that question

8 was left unresolved in Miccosukee. That's what's being

9 tried in Florida right now.

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because if it was one body

11 of water, it was okay, and if it was two bodies of

12 water, it was bad, right?

13 MR. MINEAR: Yes, but in -- at page 109, what

14 this Court said -- it talked about the S-9 pump, which

15 was central there, because it was moving the body --

16 that the -- the water. It was transmitting it. And it

17 was -- talked about pumping the water from one part of

18 the water body to the other. That's a discharge, even

19 though it's the same water body.

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it would add pollutants

21 to the other body whether it comes from the adjacent

22 body or whether it comes from some distant body. The

23 only reason that the pumping from the adjacent body did

24 not qualify is -- not because there no addition of

25 pollutants. There would be an addition of pollutions

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 from a distant lake, and you -- we'd be able to hold a

2 person liable. The only reason there was no addition

3 here was that there was -- there was an addition here,

4 but there was no discharge, because it was the same

5 body of water.

6 MR. MINEAR: With --

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I --

8 MR. MINEAR: With respect --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it seems to me that's --

10 MR. MINEAR: -- I think you have --

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- what you have here.

12 MR. MINEAR: -- it exactly backwards with

13 what the position of the United States was in

14 Miccosukee, and it explains why our -- we took that

15 position. And the Court upheld our position in

16 Miccosukee. And we're taking the different position

17 here. Because here we're talking about a discharge,

18 not an addition. The dictionary definition of

19 "discharge" nowhere speaks of "addition." Petitioners

20 have not pointed to any dictionary definition that

21 speaks in terms of an addition. It talks about a

22 flowing or issuing out. What it connotes is that the

23 water has, in some sense, been contained or confined,

24 to some degree.

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I was --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

56

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. MINEAR: And it's issuing out --

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- surprised, in a

3 case involving a FERC license condition, that no one

4 from FERC signed on to your brief.

5 MR. MINEAR: Well, Your Honor, as people in

6 the office are familiar with, in the SG's office, the

7 names in the brief tell very little about who has

8 participated in the discussions and the writing of the

9 brief. The Rapanos case --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if it's a case

11 involving a FERC license, and FERC isn't there, I think

12 it says a great deal.

13 MR. MINEAR: Well, Your Honor, this is

14 primarily a case about the Clean Water Act. I would

15 point to the Rapanos case, immediately before. The

16 Corps' name is not on the brief, and EPA's name is not

17 on the brief.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know what

19 FERC's --

20 MR. MINEAR: So, we can't draw --

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know what

22 FERC's position is --

23 MR. MINEAR: I certainly --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in this case?

25 MR. MINEAR: -- do. They join in the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

57
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 consensus position of the United States. This brief

2 has been coordinated not only with EPA and FERC, but

3 also the Department of the Interior and the Army Corps

4 of Engineers. This is the position of the United

5 States.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sure of

7 that, and it involves a reconciliation of --

8 MR. MINEAR: Right.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- competing

10 positions. Is there anything that FERC has issued that

11 is illuminating with respect to their view?

12 MR. MINEAR: I think what's illuminating is

13 their consistent position, since 1970, when this

14 provision was first enacted into law, in the Water

15 Quality Improvement Act of 1970, 2 years before the

16 Clean Water Act amendments.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree that a

18 State could adopt water quality standards that would,

19 in effect, preclude hydroelectric power in the State?

20 MR. MINEAR: I think it's certainly possible,

21 on an individual river. Imagine if a State had a river

22 that is designated as a wilderness area or a wild and

23 scenic river, and determined it did not --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would they do --

25 MR. MINEAR: -- want to have hydropower.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it statewide?

2 MR. MINEAR: If they did it statewide, I

3 think --

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Saying, "It is of

5 utmost importance to us to provide habitat for spawning

6 salmon, whatever, dams interfere with that in a way we

7 find objectionable, so we're going to go a different

8 direction, as a matter of power policy for the State of

9 whatever, and not allow hydroelectric power."

10 MR. MINEAR: If they did it statewide, it

11 would raise a question of whether or not that action is

12 preempted under the Federal Power Act, not under the

13 Clean Water Act. And that would -- that's obviously

14 not the issue here. Maine, as you have heard, supports

15 hydropower production. The question here is

16 reconciling the competing roles of the hydropower

17 company, on the one hand, and the State and Federal

18 Governments, which, in the spirit of cooperative

19 federalism, work together on these matters. We are

20 very supportive of the States' approach of reviewing

21 discharges to determine whether or not there has been

22 the creation of pollution, and determining whether or

23 not there is a violation of their water quality

24 standards. This is a part of -- an important role that

25 the State has under the Clean Water Act, that Congress

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

59

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

1 gave to the State, and to which we defend.

2 I'd like to point out that one of the things

3 that's been talked about here is the oddity, supposed

4 oddity, of a water discharging into itself. And that's

5 not odd at all. One often talks about, for instance,

6 the fresh water above the dam being discharged into the

7 fresh waters below. That's -- there's nothing unusual

8 about this, because we're talking about the

9 characteristic of a water that might be shared by the

10 water that's upstream and contained in the dam and is

11 also a characteristic of the water below. Now, under

12 section 401, the upstream characteristic doesn't

13 matter, because it's -- it refers to "any discharge,"

14 and it says "into the navigable waters." "Into" is

15 significant, because "any discharge" is "out of

16 something." And so, it can also be "into something."

17 And by stating "into navigable waters", Congress

18 indicated what it was concerned about, which was that

19 discharges that go into the navigable waters can cause

20 pollution, and, therefore, ought to be reviewed by the

21 State to make sure the water quality standards are

22 being met.

23 There's nothing unusual in this at all. It

24 simply indicates that Congress was not concerned about

25 discharges that go elsewhere; for instance, into a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

60

1 municipal water system or onto irrigated land.

2 What we have here --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: Just for the few of us who

4 think the dictionary doesn't answer the case, is it

5 possible you could say a word about why Congress would,

6 or would not, have wanted, in effect, to incorporate

7 all State water quality standards into a permission to

8 build a dam?

9 MR. MINEAR: The reason why, it was because

10 Congress gave the States primary authority under the

11 Clean Water Act to deal with pollution. Discharges

12 from confinements, from confined water, creates

13 pollution, even in the absence of pollutants, by the

14 stratification, the deprivation of oxygen, and the

15 like. And Congress recognized that where there's a

16 discharge, there's likely to be a pollution problem,

17 and that pollution problem will be manifested

18 downstream. And it, therefore, makes sense for the

19 State to be able to review and determine whether or not

20 its water quality standards will be met.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: Also to protect fish?

22 MR. MINEAR: Yes. It includes the protection

23 of fish. And, in fact, one of the things that this

24 permit does, in this particular case, this condition,

25 is, it ensures that there is, in fact, water in the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

61

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 bypass reaches. In the absence of the conditions that

2 the State imposed here, there would be no water at all

3 in the bypass reaches. Now, it's true that FERC itself

4 can impose conditions to meet these requirements --

5 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose --

6 MR. MINEAR: -- but --

7 JUSTICE ALITO: -- you have a facility that

8 produces adverse environmental effects in one State,

9 but produces power for a number of adjoining States.

10 Why does it make sense for the State in which the

11 facility is located to do the balancing of the

12 environmental and the power considerations in that

13 situation?

14 MR. MINEAR: May I answer that question --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly.

16 MR. MINEAR: -- Your Honor?

17 The Clean Water Act provides for exactly this

18 problem. It does address the problem of interstate

19 pollution. I believe that this Court's case in

20 Arkansas versus Oklahoma deals with that type of issue.

21 It provides for a reconciliation, with EPA playing an

22 important role in those interstate concerns.

23 Thank you, Your Honor.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.

25 The case is submitted.
