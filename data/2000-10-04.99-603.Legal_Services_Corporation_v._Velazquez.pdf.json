Under the Rust v. Sullivan line of cases, it is Congress itself that has the power to decide which policies or programs it will promote.  It is not the participants in the program, namely the Legal Services lawyers, the grantees, or even the clients, that have that power. Here -- here, the Government is acting to promote its policy of providing free legal services for certain categories or types of civil representation, and it is the lawyers who are delivering those services.  What Specifically, Congress decided not to finance any longer, litigation to amend or otherwise challenge the Federal or State welfare reform system."

That lawyer is joined by another lawyer who is not Legal Services-funded, and that lawyer in the same case, without using any Legal Service funds, urges, and beyond that, the existing law, if it works to deny my client benefits, it's unconstitutional. In other words, I understand your answer so far, that the Legal Services Corporation lawyer cannot present arguments about existing law.  Can that lawyer, sticking to what Congress says it will pay for, present that part of the lawsuit while another lawyer not funded by Legal Services argues questions of the consistency of the regulation, of the statute, questions of the compatibility of the statute with the Constitution?"

In that case, the integrity of the message was preserved by excluding certain views.  Here, the necessity is the argument, the argument is that the necessity is to lawyer may not be political, but the lawyer's raising of constitutional issues is normally a direct response to what, in fact, is the result of a political debate.  So you can't exclude, in effect, the significance of politics from constitutional challenge."

That did not lead to a one-directional urging for every person who walked in the door to have family planning.  It was counseling to help the client come to her own conclusion as to what the result was.  It was professional services, professional judgments just like this one is, and what the Court said --"

First of all, in Rust itself, the Court recognized that the matching funds that were required under Title X were also subject to the restrictions, and that's in footnote 5 of the Rust decision. But beyond that, what the Legal Services Corporation provided for here is exactly what was provided for in Rust, which was allowing the recipient to set up a separate entity to engage in the activities that could not be engaged in by the recipient itself. The LSC regulations were patterned directly after the regulations in Rust, and --"

But that -- what the Legal Services Corporation did here is consistent with the Regan decision, with League of Women Voters, and most significantly with Rust, in providing for that private expression.  But of course, that's to allow for the recipient's private expression, the association's private expression. Here, I think it's also important to bear in mind that the vast majority of the funds, non-LSC funds that are received, are also public funds, the IOLTA funds, the State funds, so we're not talking about an entity that has a large amount of private funds of the sort a typical private association would have."

In short, may Congress condition a subsidy to a lawyer for the poor on an explicit requirement that the fund representation in cases that involve other issues. It's not a matter of muzzling someone who's taking on a case.  It's a matter of the Government saying, this is the category of cases where we pay for representation.

The Government's Rust speaker in this case is the Government's lawyer.  That's the Government program that the Government speaks through, Government has hired somebody to speak for the Government, to advance a Government message. What the Government is attempting to do here is to commandeer the voice of the other lawyer in the case as well, and this Court has already unequivocally held that a subsidized lawyer for the poor does not act under color of law precisely because the subsidized lawyer doesn't speak for the State, may not be permitted to even think about speaking for the State, because the lawyer's duty is to the client, and to insulate the lawyer from the possibility of being controlled by the State, in the -- this Court has held unequivocally that the lawyer doesn't act under color of law.

As the Chief Justice pointed out, Rust itself did not say that, and this Court's subsequent cases have not said that. In the Rosenberger case, for example, in addition to the passage the Chief Justice quoted about using private persons to deliver a message pertaining to the Government's own program, on page 630 -- or 834, the Court further said, it does not follow from the Government speaking -- where the Government itself speaks, that it does not follow that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper when the university does not itself speak, or subsidized transmittal of a message that it favors, but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views Government's speech, the Government has decided that when it comes to a challenge of a State welfare regulation, that is not a message that the Government favors within the meaning of Rust. And again, NEA and the Wisconsin case last term did not suggest that Rust was limited to situations where it is the Government's own speech. One way in which this case raises even less of a First Amendment question than Rust is the fact that in Rust the doctor was not even permitted to advise the client where other services could be obtained.  Under this program, the Legal Services lawyer, if he or she identifies a possible challenge to a statute or regulation, may tell the client that, may refer the client to another agency, to a pro bono list. Every LSC recipient is required to have a cases are going to be funded, and there isn't enough money to go around.  Congress had to decide how those moneys should be allocated.  Lawyers do this all the time.  Legal Services recipients do this all the time, in terms of setting their own priorities. With respect to issues concerning challenging the Government's position, one need look no further than sovereign immunity on the State level to the Eleventh Amendment to recognize that there are many situations in which the Government may decline to allow challenges in court to its own positions and, by the same token, Congress could certainly choose not to -- could repeal the Equal Access to Justice Act and not provide attorney's fees to people who want to sue the Government, even though it may provide attorney's fees for suits against private parties. that way. Also, with respect to the argument that this is an anti-Government -- a prohibition against anti-Government speech, this is -- there's not a monolithic Government here.  This statute prohibits an LSC recipient from taking on a case where what she would be doing would be challenging a State regulation as being in violation of Federal law. In other words, it would be a situation where the lawyer might even be trying to vindicate, in her view, what Federal law says on the subject, but still the client is not, or the attorney is not permitted to take that on. Congress could reasonably determine in the allocation of scarce resources that that was a better allocation of the resources."
