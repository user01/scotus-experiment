3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:01 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 09-868, Wall v. Kholi. 5 Mr. Weisman. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON L. WEISMAN 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. WEISMAN: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, 9 and may it please the Court: 10 The issue before the Court today is whether 11 a State court sentence reduction motion which is a pure 12 plea for leniency qualifies as, quote, "an application 13 for post-conviction or other collateral review" within 14 the meaning of 28 U.S.C. section 2244(d)(2). The State 15 respectfully argued there are at least three reasons why 16 such a term as "collateral review" refers only to a 17 legal challenge, refers to those recognized post-direct 18 appeal applications in which constitutional, 19 jurisdictional, and other such fundamental errors may be 20 raised. 21 First, as this Court has said, it is 22 presumed -- Congress is presumed to have known the 23 language that this Court used in its decisions, and the 24 term "collateral review" has been used by this Court, 25 certainly when referring to Federal 2255 applications,

4 1 as those type of independent civil inquiries testing the 2 validity of a conviction and/or sentence - 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Weisman, the 4 phrase is "post-conviction or other" -- "or other 5 collateral review." And certainly the Rule 25 -- 35 6 motion is postconviction. 7 So it's postconviction. It's not direct 8 review. Why isn't that responsive? 9 MR. WEISMAN: Well, I think both parties are 10 in agreement, Your Honor, that the postconviction review 11 is a part and parcel of the other collateral review. 12 That's not - 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: "Or" usually means it's 14 something in addition. 15 MR. WEISMAN: Yes, but it's -- with respect, 16 Your Honor, it is "or other collateral review," and the 17 "or other" -- and I think both parties are in agreement 18 as to this -- "or other" embraces that State 19 postconviction review must also be, quote/unquote, 20 "collateral review." 21 Also, I think importantly, it would be 22 anomalous in a tolling provision, in which we are 23 talking about the direct appeal already having been 24 concluded, to embrace things that don't -- that don't - 25 that come prior to the direct appeal. This is a tolling
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
5 1 -- obviously, 2244(d)(1) speaks about the finality of a 2 State court judgment of conviction. At that point, 3 obviously - 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you go back to the - 5 you said -- you said "prior to." I thought the Rule 35 6 motion is made after the conviction. 7 MR. WEISMAN: Well, it can be made -- it can 8 be made prior to when the conviction becomes final. For 9 example, it can be made within 120 days of the 10 imposition of sentence. Or it can be made within 11 120 days after the affirmance of the conviction on 12 direct appeal of the Rhode Island Supreme Court. So it 13 can be made prior to when the conviction becomes, 14 quote/unquote, "final." 15 JUSTICE KAGAN: But isn't that true 16 regardless of whether the Rule 35 motion seeks legal 17 relief or discretionary relief alone? That both can be 18 made prior to the finality of the judgment? 19 MR. WEISMAN: That is true, Your Honor. 20 JUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and if I understand 21 your argument, your argument is that Rule 35 motions 22 that seek legal review do fall within the 2244(d)(2) 23 language. It's just that Rule 35 motions that seek 24 discretionary relief do not. 25 MR. WEISMAN: Well, I'm not sure we conceded
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that point, Your Honor. I think clearly we're all in

6

2 agreement that postconviction vehicles and habeas

3 vehicles, which obviously all traditionally occur after

4 the direct appeal has been concluded, obviously qualify

5 as what this Court -- and everybody, we would suggest -

6 recognizes as, quote/unquote, "collateral review."

7 In terms of a Rule 35 motion that says, for

8 example, the sentence is outside of the -- outside of

9 the proper boundaries, it's unlawful as a matter of law,

10 I don't think we've actually conceded before this Court

11 that that would qualify. But certainly this Court -

12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would Rule 35 permit a

13 challenge for a Federal violation? You've given an

14 example of an illegal sentence that you think is

15 discretionary; am I correct?

16 MR. WEISMAN: Not in -

17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But does Rule 35(a)

18 permit a legal challenge of the kind that Justice Kagan

19 was asking?

20 MR. WEISMAN: Correct. Our Rule 35 contains

21 within the same provision a challenge to the legality of

22 the sentence, to the manner in which it was imposed -

23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Let's assume

24 a pure legal challenge.

25 MR. WEISMAN: A pure legal challenge,

2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would Rule 35(a) be

3 other collateral relief -

4 MR. WEISMAN: We would -

5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- as designated by the

6 statute?

7 MR. WEISMAN: We would suggest that this

8 Court doesn't have to answer that question here. There

9 are good arguments why it would not, again, because in a

10 tolling provision that speaks about collateral review

11 and, again, 2255 -

12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So explain again why you

13 don't think this is collateral?

14 MR. WEISMAN: Well, certainly when all

15 you're doing, as the First Circuit recognized, is making

16 a pure plea for leniency, sentence leniency, you're

17 not -

18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. Why is

19 Rule 35, assuming it's a -- a challenge to an illegal

20 sentence on a legal ground -

21 MR. WEISMAN: Well, it could be argued -

22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why would it not be

23 collateral review?

24 MR. WEISMAN: Well, it could be argued that

25 we're talking about vehicles that challenge the validity

8 1 of a judgment that has already survived scrutiny under 2 direct review. And a Rule 35 vehicle, even one that 3 raises a legal challenge -- and a tolling provision 4 simply would not begin to run at that point. 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't 6 understand your argument at all. It seems to me the 7 phrase "post-conviction or other collateral review" 8 means postconviction collateral review or preconviction 9 collateral review. Isn't that what is added? 10 "Post-conviction or other"; what's "other" from 11 "post-conviction"? I guess it would be preconviction, 12 wouldn't it? 13 MR. WEISMAN: Well, we would suggest, Your 14 Honor, that the "collateral review," as explained by 15 this Court, is referring to the difference between 16 collateral review and direct review. And the case in - 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine. And is this 18 direct review? 19 MR. WEISMAN: This would not -- this is 20 clearly not -- this is not in the direct review process. 21 No, it's not. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's collateral review? 23 So - 24 MR. WEISMAN: Well - 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you lose.

9 1 MR. WEISMAN: This -- this Court, though, 2 Your Honor, has said that, speaking about when Congress 3 enacted 2255, it simplified the procedure for making a 4 collateral attack on a final judgment entered in a 5 Federal criminal case, but it did not purport to modify 6 the distinction, again, between collateral review and 7 direct review. 8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would think that if -- if 9 there's anything to the point you're making, it -- it 10 hinges not on the "post-conviction or other collateral" 11 phrase, but rather on the word "review." 12 I suppose it could be argued that you're not 13 reviewing the judgment if you're asking for mercy. 14 Whether a judgment was good or bad, you're -- you're 15 asking for mercy. And I would -- you know, perhaps it's 16 not review. Is that your point? 17 MR. WEISMAN: Well, we go forward and use 18 that -- even -- we would suggest, Your Honor, even more 19 strongly that the phrase "collateral review," as that 20 phrase has been used by this Court consistently, 21 recognizes that this is a procedure that occurs after 22 the completion of a direct review process. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's only because 24 all the cases we've had involved that. We've never had 25 a case like this before. So in all those other cases,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
10 1 we've used the natural term "collateral review." That 2 doesn't mean it couldn't apply to this. It just means 3 we've never had occasion to inquire whether it applies 4 to this. 5 MR. WEISMAN: But, Your Honor, respectfully, 6 in State v. Addonizio itself, it contrasted the Rule 35 7 motion, for example. Many jurisdictions, including 8 obviously the Federal courts, had this very -- almost 9 exact Rule 35-type proceeding. It has never been 10 referred to, it has never been understood in thousands 11 of cases, as collateral review. It always had been 12 understood as a -- sort of a quasi-civil inquiry, after 13 the - 14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Weisman, I think that 15 that's not right, that the -- as you say, that the 16 Rule 35 motion that Rhode Island has is based on the 17 Federal Rule 35 motion that existed prior to 1987, and 18 that on a couple of occasions this Court talked about 19 that prior Federal Rule 35 as collateral review. Am I 20 wrong about that? 21 MR. WEISMAN: We don't believe so, Your 22 Honor. 23 JUSTICE KAGAN: U.S. v. Robinson, 24 Bartone v. United States. And I might be wrong about 25 it.
Alderson Reporting Company

11 1 MR. WEISMAN: We don't believe it ever 2 referred to a sentence -- a plea for sentence leniency, 3 Your Honor, no, not -- not as a plea, a pure plea for 4 leniency under Rule 35. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the current Federal 6 rule - 7 MR. WEISMAN: Yes. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- provides for -- it's 9 Rule 35 also, but it doesn't have the pure leniency? 10 That's Rhode Island's? 11 MR. WEISMAN: That's correct -- correct, 12 Your Honor. We're just speaking about the pre-1987 13 guidelines rule, which is the same. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume that we adopt 15 your formulation generally, that it has to be for legal 16 error, collateral review has to be for legal error, and 17 we could even add what the Ninth Circuit has found, it 18 has to be by a court in order to avoid clemency, parole 19 review boards, and so forth. 20 I don't see why you don't lose anyway, 21 because the allegation here, the complaint, the 22 argument, may be that there was an abuse of discretion, 23 and if there's an abuse of discretion, that is a legal 24 ground to set aside the -- the sentence. 25 MR. WEISMAN: I think, Your Honor, we have
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
12 1 to differentiate between a legal ground and the vehicle. 2 Again, the vehicle, the reduction, the plea for leniency 3 vehicle, is not a legal vehicle. It's simply, I think, 4 as the Kholi panel recognized - 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's a motion made 6 in a court, reviewable by the appellate courts of the 7 State. 8 MR. WEISMAN: Well, it -- but -- but - 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a little odd to say 10 that that's not legal. If -- an abuse of discretion 11 standard is something we're quite familiar with in the 12 law. We've never thought of that as being somehow 13 extra-legal. 14 MR. WEISMAN: Well, to the extent it's abuse 15 of discretion, it's really shorthand for the appellate 16 court takes a look; if the sentence is within the proper 17 bounds and if there was, quote, "some justification" for 18 the imposition of the sentence, then it's affirmed. And 19 just like on the - 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if there's no 21 justification, what do they do? 22 MR. WEISMAN: If there's no justification -23 I mean, I can say it hasn't happened so far in our 24 State, and I think -- you know, I don't know what 25 happens in other States, but, essentially, that's all
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
13 1 the inquiry is. They take a look at the sentence; if 2 it's in the legal bounds, the filing of the motion 3 itself, as to pre-'87 guidelines, presumes the validity 4 of the conviction and sentence, and it simply says: 5 Give me a second chance; take a second look; look at the 6 offender, look at the characteristics, look at what - 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are those different 8 than the characteristics that the sentencing judge looks 9 at in the first instance? 10 MR. WEISMAN: They could be the same. They 11 could be other. There is a wide - 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, how 13 these -- you've obviously seen a lot of these, and I 14 haven't seen any, but I mean, do the Rule 35 motions 15 typically say -- do they typically concede the legal 16 validity of the sentence and then simply say -- what? I 17 mean, I assume the sentencing is -- is completely open 18 and you can put in anything at all, like the -- the 19 deprived childhood, the unique situation, the age, 20 whatever. 21 MR. WEISMAN: Correct. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In what sense is 23 Rule 35 different from the arguments that are made at 24 sentencing? 25 MR. WEISMAN: It's not much different at
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
14 1 all, Your Honor. It is essentially the same. It is - 2 it is simply - 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's bad for 4 you, isn't it, I mean for the very point that Justice 5 Kennedy was raising? If it's the same sort of arguments 6 that you get to raise as a legal matter prior to the 7 imposition of sentencing, why should they not be 8 considered legal matters when they're raised under Rule 9 35? 10 MR. WEISMAN: Because we don't believe they 11 are legal matters, Your Honor. What they're asking for 12 is sentence leniency based on pure factual matters like, 13 as you indicated, Your Honor, Chief Justice, the history 14 of the individual, the various - 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are those issues 16 that can be -- that are typically raised on direct - 17 direct review? 18 MR. WEISMAN: No, they're not, Your Honor. 19 We have a procedure whereby generally sentence reduction 20 and sentencing issues must be raised pursuant to 21 Rule 35. 22 If I could - 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you quarrel with a 24 statement in Mollicone, a Rhode Island 2000 decision 25 that says we will interfere with the trial court's
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
15 1 discretion, vis-à-vis sentencing, only in rare instances 2 where the trial justice has imposed a sentence that is 3 without justification and is grossly disparate from the 4 other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses? 5 MR. WEISMAN: No. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that the review 7 standard? 8 MR. WEISMAN: Correct, correct. What the - 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That is the standard of 10 review, correct? 11 MR. WEISMAN: Yes. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So please explain to me 13 why that is not what Justice Kennedy described as a 14 review for abuse of discretion and why a review for 15 abuse of discretion is not a legal challenge? 16 MR. WEISMAN: Well, what we suggest is the 17 abuse of discretion that that is talking about is if 18 there's no justification. They look -- again, they look 19 at the sentence, and if there's no justification for it, 20 then it will be an abuse of discretion. If there's some 21 justification -- and, again, it hasn't happened. If 22 there's some -- if the sentence is within the legal 23 limits and there's some justification for it, it will be 24 affirmed. That's - 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Am I
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 misunderstanding you?

16

2 MR. WEISMAN: That's the shorthand.

3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you saying that the

4 Rhode Island appellate courts never change a sentence

5 under Rule 35?

6 MR. WEISMAN: We have not -

7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or are you saying that

8 they do find some lack of justification in some

9 sentences?

10 MR. WEISMAN: No. What we're -- what we're

11 saying, Your Honor, is if there's some justification for

12 it and if it's within the legal sentencing bounds, the

13 denial of the Rule 35 motion is affirmed. And that

14 happens all the time.

15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then think

16 you're saying that it only gets reversed for abuse of

17 discretion, right?

18 MR. WEISMAN: Well, Your Honor -

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's a legal ground,

20 it seems to me. And I don't know how you could say that

21 that's a plea for leniency. It's a plea that -- that

22 the sentencing court abused its discretion and should

23 have given a lesser sentence. How is that leniency?

24 It's abuse of discretion.

25 MR. WEISMAN: Because the inquiry is simply

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 -- I understand the words "abuse of discretion" are

17

2 used, but the "no justification and manifestly excessive

3 standard" simply, as the cases explicate, looks at the

4 sentence; if it's legal and if there's some

5 justification for it, the appeal is denied.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't want to have to

7 figure this out case by case, or even jurisdiction by

8 jurisdiction, as to whether it's an abuse of discretion

9 review or a leniency review or this or that. And

10 that -- that makes me inclined to say we should treat

11 your Rule 35 as coming within the tolling provision, so

12 we don't have to grapple with -- I mean, I'm not having

13 very much success understanding the distinction that

14 you're telling me. I don't want to have to do this for

15 50 States.

16 MR. WEISMAN: I understand. But certainly,

17 Your Honor, just -- just using the formulation that

18 everything that's filed in a State court post a judgment

19 of conviction qualifies would certainly be an odd way

20 for that Congress to have expressed that.

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you read the -- the

22 relevant provision of the Rule 35? I mean, there are

23 two categories, the ones about legal challenges, at

24 least as I read the rule, and -

25 MR. WEISMAN: Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
18 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Read the relevant part of 2 Rule 35. 3 MR. WEISMAN: Yes, certainly, Your Honor: 4 "The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time." 5 Period. "The court may correct a sentence imposed in an 6 illegal manner, and it may reduce any sentence when a 7 motion is filed within 120 days after sentence is 8 imposed or within 120 days after receipt by the court of 9 a mandate." 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're talking about 11 reducing - 12 MR. WEISMAN: We're talking -- this case 13 involves only a motion to reduce sentence. And 14 certainly the policy considerations for what Congress 15 would have intended - 16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Weisman, I'm sorry. 17 Before you talk about policy, so this motion to reduce 18 sentence is very short. It just says that the man 19 "prays that the sentence imposed with respect to the 20 above matter be reduced in accordance with the 21 provisions of Rule 35." Would it make a difference to 22 you if it said he prays that the sentence imposed -- he 23 prays that the illegal sentence imposed with respect to 24 the above matter be reduced in accordance with 25 provisions of Rule 35?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 MR. WEISMAN: It might be.

19

2 JUSTICE KAGAN: If he had put in that word,

3 "illegal," would that have made the difference?

4 MR. WEISMAN: It might, Your Honor. And

5 under our system, it might -- that might have been

6 characterized, not as a sentence reduction provision or

7 sentence reduction vehicle, but as a legal motion to

8 correct an illegal sentence, or challenging the

9 sentence.

10 JUSTICE KAGAN: So -- but that does suggest

11 the difficulty that Justice Scalia raises, is that we're

12 going to have to look at the particular rule of the

13 State, we're going to have to look at the particular

14 motion, we're going to look at any -- we're going to

15 have to look at any State law regarding how motions are

16 construed.

17 MR. WEISMAN: Sure.

18 JUSTICE KAGAN: And this is going to be a

19 very difficult determination.

20 MR. WEISMAN: Sure. If I could just address

21 that, Your Honor. The problem is -- it's simply because

22 a statute of limitations is an affirmative defense,

23 these are matters that already are going to have been

24 concluded in the State court. Before anyone files for

25 2254, the State's court's going to have findings.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
20 1 They're going to -- it's either going to be a motion for 2 sentence leniency or it's going to be a motion to 3 correct an illegal sentence. 4 These matters -- and they have to be pled by 5 the State as well. So when an applicant goes to Federal 6 court, district court, and files a 2254, if we want to 7 raise the affirmative defense of the time bar, which 8 will save the Federal court a lot of time, obviously, 9 because there is no case at all -- and if we can 10 contrast it with exhaustion, for example, which, as this 11 Court obviously is familiar with, presents very 12 complicated questions of whether, you know, State 13 procedures were exhausted and claims were exhausted, 14 this is very straightforward. If somebody raises a 15 motion which challenges the legality of the sentence, it 16 will be characterized in State court in the run of the 17 mine -- in the run of the mine cases, as an 18 illegal sentence. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So a petitioner in the 20 future in Rhode Island should file a petition that says: 21 I'm filing a motion pursuant to 35(a) for an illegal 22 sentence -- make something up - 23 MR. WEISMAN: Right. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- or for leniency. And 25 then are district courts supposed to figure out whether
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
21 1 the legal challenge was frivolous or not or had a basis 2 in law or fact - 3 MR. WEISMAN: Well - 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and then decide 5 whether they would toll or not toll based on that now 6 side trial on what's an illegal sentence and what's just 7 a plea for leniency? That's what you are proposing? 8 MR. WEISMAN: Well, what we suggest actually 9 is very straightforward, Your Honor. If somebody 10 captions their document, you know, "Motion for sentence" 11 -- "for sentence reduction and motion to correct an 12 illegal sentence," that's not this case, obviously, 13 because then the court - 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what if they say 15 "correct the illegal sentence because it was an abuse of 16 discretion"? 17 MR. WEISMAN: If it's - 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is the magic words 19 "illegal sentence" or is the magic words "abuse of" - 20 what are the magic words? 21 MR. WEISMAN: Well, it may not so much be 22 magic words, but it's what the -- as this Court has 23 said, it's what the substance of the motion seeks, and 24 that will already have been determined in State court. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Either -- either your
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
22 1 victory will give you absolutely nothing, or you have 2 truly stupid defendant lawyers in Rhode Island. I mean, 3 why would anybody not caption the 35 motion that way? 4 MR. WEISMAN: Because - 5 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's to lose? You say it 6 doesn't matter if your claim of an illegal sentence is 7 frivolous or not. What's to lose? 8 MR. WEISMAN: Because, Your Honor, they 9 actually want to reduce their sentence. It's not -- we 10 don't suggest it's not a matter of playing games. They 11 -- you know, they feel they were sentenced for 30 years 12 and maybe they want 20 years, and if they want to 13 challenge the legality of the sentence, they recognize 14 the established collateral attack vehicles. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: There is another argument 16 that you could make, other than the one you've been 17 pressing, which is that collateral review means 18 something other than a step in the criminal case. But 19 you've chosen not to make that; is that correct? 20 MR. WEISMAN: Well, we've spoken about the 21 words "collateral review" as embracing a case that's 22 already -- upon looking -- a proceeding that occurs 23 after the finality of the judgment, which obviously 24 includes this Court's denial of cert or the time - 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you've said that this
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 could be done before finality. I thought -- I -

23

2 MR. WEISMAN: No.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure you said that

4 earlier, that this motion can be made before the

5 judgment is final. Didn't you say that?

6 MR. WEISMAN: It can. It certainly can,

7 Your Honor. And we would suggest -

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not what you

9 just said.

10 MR. WEISMAN: No -

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: What you just said is after

12 the finality. Which is it?

13 MR. WEISMAN: We would suggest, Your Honor,

14 that that furthers our argument. A Rule 35 motion is

15 not collateral review because it is not a motion -- you

16 could say even in a legal sense, motion. It's not a

17 motion that occurs after the judgment becomes final.

18 And we're looking at a tolling provision, and the

19 congressional intent of the tolling provision was

20 finality and exhaustion of State remedies.

21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm not sure

22 I understand that. There's nothing in this rule that

23 bars a litigant from filing after the conviction is

24 final. They have 120 days.

25 MR. WEISMAN: They have 120 days. It can be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
24 1 filed after the sentence is imposed, 120 days of that 2 date, or 120 days after the conviction becomes final. 3 And we would suggest that the term "collateral review" 4 embraces, as Justice Alito indicated, sort of that 5 concept that, obviously in a tolling provision, it 6 begins to run when the conviction becomes final. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Scalia's 8 suggestion - 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that it says - 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that perhaps the - 11 the leniency review is -- is not review of the 12 conviction or sentence. But you didn't -- you didn't do 13 anything with that. You didn't argue that the kind of 14 review that's involved with leniency is really not 15 review of the sentence for legal error. 16 MR. WEISMAN: It's clearly not, Your Honor, 17 correct. I think, as everybody here recognizes, the 18 Kholi panel and the Respondents in this case as well 19 characterized this Rule 35 proceeding as sort of apart, 20 distinct, away from the underlying case. And that's 21 undoubtedly true in the sense that it's not -- it's not 22 part of the direct review process. It's -- it's clearly 23 not. But that doesn't mean it's collateral review. 24 It's not either/or. It could be - 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what -- is it
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 something in between? It's not direct and it's not

25

2 collateral?

3 MR. WEISMAN: It's -- it's neither fish nor

4 fowl, Your Honor. I mean, simply because it's not part

5 of a direct review process doesn't mean that it's,

6 quote, our argument would be, "collateral review,"

7 because, again, "collateral review" has this sort of

8 meaning in the law, using this Court's decisions, using

9 this Court's cases, referring to a post-judgment vehicle

10 in which fundamental jurisdictional and other types of

11 errors can be raised.

12 JUSTICE ALITO: What about a motion -

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess we need a new

14 adjective then, because I'd always thought that there

15 are two kinds of review, direct and collateral. You say

16 there's a -- a tertium quid. What do you want us to

17 call that?

18 MR. WEISMAN: Well, I don't know that it

19 needs to be called anything, Your Honor. I think the

20 only question with respect -

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that maybe it

22 doesn't need to be called anything because it doesn't

23 exist. I -- I can't -

24 MR. WEISMAN: Well -

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- imagine anything that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 isn't either direct or collateral.

26

2 MR. WEISMAN: -- it is certainly -- it is

3 certainly an interesting vehicle because, it can be

4 filed prior to the finality of the judgment and it can

5 be filed -- and it can be filed after the judgment

6 becomes final.

7 And, again, going -- going back to the

8 policies, the 2244(d)(2), very clearly, two big

9 policies, again, are finality, which obviously it

10 promotes -- these cases would not be in Federal court if

11 they were time-barred -- and exhaustion of State

12 remedies. To have a motion that seeks leniency only,

13 there's no purpose that could be accomplished by

14 bringing that motion into Federal court, and therefore

15 it doesn't serve that purpose.

16 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Weisman, that's

17 true also of State habeas claims that are based only on

18 State law. But six circuits have said that 2244(d)(2)

19 applies to those claims. Are you contesting that?

20 MR. WEISMAN: We're not. But the -- but the

21 important element there, Your Honor, is that those

22 vehicles can be raised to bring -- those are the

23 vehicles, the collateral vehicles, through which the

24 States have channelled constitutional, jurisdictional,

25 and other fundamental claims.

Alderson Reporting Company

27 1 The Rule 35 sentence reduction vehicle 2 doesn't -- can't do it, can't do that service. So, 3 sure, you could have -- you could have a habeas, and the 4 only issue, the only claim raised in habeas could be, 5 you know, it's in violation of -- of my State rights, 6 which couldn't be heard in 2254, but - 7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Where the exhaustion policy 8 does not come into effect. 9 MR. WEISMAN: Exactly. But Congress may 10 have well said we're not going to be in the business of 11 looking at the individual claims. Look, this is a 12 collateral review vehicle. This vehicle is a recognized 13 vehicle for bringing, for channeling in these claims. 14 So that's going to toll. 15 But this other vehicle, this Rule 35 16 sentence reduction vehicle -- it can never be used for a 17 claim that could go to Federal court. It's pointless. 18 I mean, it wouldn't serve the purpose, and of course it 19 would undermine the State's interest in getting the 20 State prisoners into Federal court within 1 year. 21 I'll reserve my time if that's okay, Your 22 Honor. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 24 MR. WEISMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Mizner.

28 1 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH H. MIZNER 2 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 3 MS. MIZNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 4 please the Court: 5 The First Circuit here correctly held that 6 Khalil Kholi's motion for a reduction of sentence under 7 Rhode Island Rule 35 was an application for State 8 postconviction or other collateral review with respect 9 to the pertinent judgment or claim. As such, it tolled 10 AEDPA's 1-year limitation period, and Mr. Kholi's 11 petition was timely filed. 12 We look to the common usage and ordinary 13 understanding of the words of the tolling provision in 14 the context of the statute. Collateral review is a 15 proceeding occurring after final judgment that could 16 affect that judgment. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: Am I correct that you think 18 "post-conviction or other collateral review" means 19 anything that occurs after the conclusion of direct 20 review? 21 MS. MIZNER: Yes, for purposes of the 22 tolling provision. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: Then what does the phrase 24 "or other collateral review" add? Why -- why wouldn't 25 Congress just say "post-conviction review"?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
29 1 MS. MIZNER: In Duncan, this Court talked 2 about the possibility of civil commitment or contempt in 3 custody that could be part of the Rule 2254 proceeding 4 and that that would not be postconviction. So that 5 postconviction is a form of collateral review but is not 6 the only form. 7 In Duncan, the Court also discussed the fact 8 that many States may call what other States call 9 "post-conviction review" something else, and that that 10 would also then be collateral. The collateral is just 11 a -- an umbrella that encompasses postconviction and 12 other forms of review after a judgment. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you just 14 call your motion a motion to correct an illegal 15 sentence? Then we wouldn't have any dispute here, I 16 gather. 17 MS. MIZNER: Under the State's theory, there 18 would not be. I did not file this motion. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not one of 20 the stupid lawyers that we were worried about before. 21 (Laughter.) 22 MS. MIZNER: I may be in other respects, 23 Your Honor, but not this one. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sure of that. 25 But you do think that if you had -- if you or whoever
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
30 1 files these motions had simply said that, there would be 2 no problem, right? 3 MS. MIZNER: From the State's perspective. 4 I don't think that there's a problem with omitting the 5 word "illegal," because - 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's because 7 you want something other than legal review, right? You 8 want to throw yourself on the mercy of the court. 9 You've got plenty of avenues to correct the illegality 10 of the sentence, but this is something different, right? 11 This is to -- not correct -- you admit it's illegal, but 12 you say but it should still be reduced for a lot of 13 reasons. 14 MS. MIZNER: Yes. It is a request for the 15 court to -- to review, to take a second look, to 16 reexamine the sentence to determine whether or not it 17 was unduly severe at the time that it was imposed. You 18 are asking the court to -- to take a second look, either 19 based on factors that were submitted at sentencing or 20 additional information that - 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can raise all of 22 those -- all of those claims under the normal State 23 collateral postconviction, State habeas, all those other 24 things, right? 25 MS. MIZNER: You can raise those issues
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 under the postconviction review. You can also raise

31

2 them -- in Rhode Island, there is a provision of the

3 postconviction review statute that speaks of the -- any

4 facts that would require a new proceeding in the

5 interests of justice.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I guess I'm

7 having trouble. You can -- the various grounds on which

8 the sentence should have been lower than it was,

9 including the fact that setting the sentence at that

10 level was an abuse of discretion, you obviously can

11 raise those at sentencing and you can raise those on

12 direct review, right?

13 MS. MIZNER: In Rhode Island, you cannot

14 challenge your sentence on direct review.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you challenge it

16 on -- in State habeas?

17 MS. MIZNER: You challenge it by way of the

18 Rule 35 motion.

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the only

20 vehicle you have -

21 MS. MIZNER: It's the normal -

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's the only

23 vehicle you have for challenging the sentence.

24 MS. MIZNER: That's the normal vehicle that

25 is used for challenging the sentence. I believe that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 you could also encompass it in a motion for

32

2 postconviction relief, which is the kind of umbrella

3 Rhode Island procedure for raising -- for a legal

4 challenge.

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So after a conviction in

6 the State, if there's an appeal with a number -- on

7 direct review, with a number of issues, improperly

8 admitted evidence and so forth, you -- the lawyer can't

9 add: And, in addition, he was sentenced under the wrong

10 provision; he was given 5 years too many because the

11 judge cited the wrong provision. You can't say that on

12 direct review?

13 MS. MIZNER: Under my understanding of the

14 Rhode Island Supreme Court decisions, the answer to that

15 is no.

16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can challenge only

17 the conviction, not the sentence, on direct review?

18 MS. MIZNER: I believe that that is the

19 holding of the Rhode Island Supreme Court.

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do -

21 CHIEF JUSTICE: In what -

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree that Rule 35

23 is not something that the prisoner must exhaust before

24 seeking Federal habeas?

25 MS. MIZNER: Exhaustion for Federal habeas

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
33 1 is limited to exhaustion of the claims that are going to 2 be presented in the Federal habeas petition. And since 3 a -- the denial of a request for a sentence reduction on 4 the grounds of abuse of discretion is not going to be a 5 claim that is cognizable in Federal habeas corpus 6 jurisdiction, then you would not need to exhaust it. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is the whole 8 purpose of allowing tolling of the 1-year Federal 9 statute, the purpose to give the petitioner an 10 opportunity to exhaust what he must exhaust? 11 MS. MIZNER: Exhaustion is one of the 12 purposes of the tolling provision, but this Court has 13 recognized that AEDPA's purpose was to further the 14 principles of comity and finality and federalism, and 15 had a clear purpose of encouraging litigants to pursue 16 claims in State court prior to seeking Federal review. 17 So, tying the tolling provision to State 18 applications shows congressional concern for comity, 19 which at its core is a -- is a respect for the State 20 processes that are used in reviewing the claims of State 21 prisoners. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I may have 23 asked this already, but it seems unusual to me so I want 24 to make sure of the answer. Your -- you have a client 25 who is convicted of a particular offense that results in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 a sentence of, what, zero to 5 years, okay? And the

34

2 judge, in imposing the sentence, engages in racial

3 discrimination. It turns out that he sentences

4 African-Americans to 5 years and Caucasian defendants to

5 2 years. That, you're telling me, is a claim that you

6 cannot raise on direct review or on -- in State habeas?

7 MS. MIZNER: It would be raised in the State

8 Rule 35, a motion to correct.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say it

10 "would be raised." Are you saying it can only be raised

11 under Rule 35?

12 MS. MIZNER: It could be raised under the

13 State postconviction review proceedings as well.

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what I would

15 have thought. So Rule 35 is not the only vehicle for

16 challenging a sentence?

17 MS. MIZNER: No.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- your adversary said

20 the contrary, and I was -- you're flip-flopping. Can

21 this be brought on a direct appeal or not?

22 MS. MIZNER: No, not -

23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A non-legal sentence?

24 MS. MIZNER: Not on direct appeal.

25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what did you mean

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 when you answered the Chief Justice that it could be

35

2 brought in collateral proceedings?

3 MS. MIZNER: Well, rule 35 is a collateral

4 proceeding -

5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -

6 MS. MIZNER: The -

7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just so your adversary,

8 when he gets up on rebuttal, can confirm or not this

9 point, any challenge to an illegal sentence has to be

10 brought first in a Rule 35(a) motion, regardless of what

11 the grounds of the illegality are?

12 MS. MIZNER: Yes, or perhaps in a motion for

13 postconviction relief under section 10-9.1.

14 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I return to the question

15 Justice Ginsburg asked a couple of minutes ago? We have

16 -- let's say we have a case in which a defendant

17 convicted in State court has some exhausted Federal

18 claims that this defendant wants to raise in a Federal

19 habeas; also files a motion seeking a reduction of

20 sentence based purely on a request for leniency, a

21 sentence within the range prescribed by the statute.

22 What purpose is served by tolling the time to file the

23 Federal habeas during the pendency of this request for

24 leniency in the State court? Now, you say comity, but

25 in concrete practical terms, what purpose is served?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
36 1 MS. MIZNER: A prisoner who receives 2 adequate relief in the State court, through whatever 3 vehicle, may choose not to pursue a Federal habeas 4 corpus claim. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: In your experience, does 6 that happen a lot? You have somebody who is sentenced 7 to a 5-year sentence and that's within the range, also 8 has legal challenges that would result in no conviction, 9 no time whatsoever and no criminal conviction -- that 10 person decides to give up on the legal challenge because 11 the 5-year sentence might be reduced to 3 or 2 or 1? 12 MS. MIZNER: I would say that would be 13 unlikely, but there are many Federal habeas cases that 14 are -- raise questions of, for example, ineffective 15 assistance of counsel at sentencing. A State resolution 16 that reduces the sentence would obviate the need for a 17 Federal habeas petition in that context. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: Can you explain - 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you look at 2255 - 20 that's the Federal postconviction review, and it also 21 has a 1-year statute of limitations. That limitation 22 would not be tolled for a Federal Rule 35 motion. So 23 why should it be tolled for State? 24 MS. MIZNER: 2255, Justice Ginsburg, has no 25 tolling provision at all, and the reason for that may
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 perhaps be the respect for comity that Congress

37

2 recognized when you are addressing a 2254 petition filed

3 by a State prisoner.

4 JUSTICE KAGAN: I think, Ms. Mizner, the

5 amicus brief in this case asserted that, in Rhode Island

6 or in other States with a rule like this, many judges

7 sit on these Rule 35 motions. They just let them stay

8 pending for a considerable period of time, in order to

9 retain some ability to modify the sentence if and when

10 they feel like doing so. Is that your understanding of

11 what happens to these motions, that they just sit, that

12 they are not denied?

13 MS. MIZNER: I don't practice in Rhode

14 Island, but in this case the Rule 35 did not sit. It

15 was resolved by the trial court within 3 months. The

16 issue, the potential for abuse from sitting on motions

17 is not limited to a Rhode Island Rule 35. It's not a

18 peculiar concern.

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess the

20 question -- and I'm sorry if I cut you off -- is not

21 that this is a question of abuse, that it may be a good

22 thing. The idea is you've got a motion for reduction of

23 sentence because of mercy, and the judge might say:

24 Well, I'm inclined to exercise mercy if you come out of

25 the rehab program in a good way, if it turns out after

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
38 1 the first several months that you're a model prisoner. 2 In other words, it's not a question of abuse, it's a 3 good thing; and if we start saying that the time for 4 Federal habeas is tolled, judges might be inclined not 5 to exercise such charity based on the prisoner's conduct 6 after conviction. 7 MS. MIZNER: Well, the Rule 35 also provides 8 that the decision must be made within a reasonable time. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 120 days, right? 10 MS. MIZNER: No, 120 days is the time 11 frame - 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: For filing? 13 MS. MIZNER: -- within which the motion must 14 be filed. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 16 MS. MIZNER: The rule also provides that it 17 must be decided, resolved, within a reasonable time. So 18 there is a -- a limitation in that respect. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have any indication 20 in the case law what a reasonable time consists of? 21 MS. MIZNER: I have not found any Rhode 22 Island cases discussing that particular question. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Can you go back for a 24 second? Imagine a defendant is convicted of robbery and 25 he's sentenced to 10 years. He thinks there is an error
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
39 1 in my conviction of a legal nature, and he thinks there 2 is another error in my -- in my sentence of a legal 3 nature. Now, I take it in Rhode Island he files an 4 appeal to consider the first. 5 MS. MIZNER: Yes, Justice Breyer. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: And as to the second, he 7 files a Rule 35 motion. 8 MS. MIZNER: That's my understanding of 9 Rhode Island - 10 JUSTICE BREYER: And when does he file the 11 Rule 35 motion? Because it says at any time. 12 MS. MIZNER: No. A Rule 35 motion must be 13 filed within 120 days. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: No, it doesn't say that. 15 It says a court may correct an illegal sentence "at any 16 time." I'm talking - 17 MS. MIZNER: I'm sorry. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: It has nothing to do with 19 mercy. I want to know how it works. He says there's a 20 legal error in my sentence. When -- how does he get 21 that corrected? 22 MS. MIZNER: A defendant would have an 23 interest in getting it corrected as soon as possible. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: I have -- I'm not -- don't 25 take what I have as my view. I just want the fact. I'm
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
40 1 asking you a fact. When -- how and when does the person 2 correct the legal error in his sentence? 3 MS. MIZNER: He could correct it by filing 4 the motion at any time, and - 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Where? 6 MS. MIZNER: In the trial court. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: And if the trial court says 8 no, what does he do? 9 MS. MIZNER: He appeals that. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Okay. So now we 11 have two appeals. One is from the judgment of 12 conviction; another is from the judgment imposing the 13 sentence. Now, the Federal statute says a 1-year period 14 of limitation shall apply from the date on which the 15 judgment became final. Correct? 16 MS. MIZNER: Yes. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. When is the date on 18 which the judgment of the sentence became final? 19 MS. MIZNER: If both appeals are pending at 20 the same time, the practice would be to consolidate 21 them, so you would have a ruling from the Rhode Island 22 Supreme Court - 23 JUSTICE BREYER: And if they are not 24 appealing -- they are not -- they are not at the same 25 time, then what?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
41 1 MS. MIZNER: Then the judgment would become 2 final when the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed the 3 conviction and either this Court - 4 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not the sentence? 5 MS. MIZNER: You may have two time frames - 6 JUSTICE BREYER: In April, they affirm the 7 conviction. In June, they affirm the sentence. Do 8 those 2 months -- does the date on which the judgment 9 became final by conclusion of direct review, does that 10 run from April or from June? 11 MS. MIZNER: I would say June. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: June. Okay. Now, suppose 13 he doesn't -- suppose that there were no appeal from 14 the -- I see. Our problem is that there is no appeal 15 from the judgment -- from the sentence where he asks for 16 correction as a matter of mercy and not law. 17 MS. MIZNER: There may be an appeal - 18 JUSTICE BREYER: There may be? 19 MS. MIZNER: -- from such -- from the denial 20 of a Rule 35. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm trying to figure 22 out is why, if you're willing to call, for purposes of 23 one -- the 1-year statute begins to run from the time 24 the direct appeal becomes final. Why is it a direct 25 appeal of a sentence where you appeal the matter of law
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
42 1 and it isn't a direct appeal of a sentence where you ask 2 for mercy? It's the same rule. It's the same 3 procedure. 4 MS. MIZNER: It -- the Rule 35 - 5 JUSTICE BREYER: This would help you just as 6 much, I imagine. I'm just trying to get it straight in 7 my mind. 8 MS. MIZNER: Rhode Island's manner of 9 addressing the Rule 35 seems to be somewhat unusual in 10 terms of - 11 JUSTICE BREYER: I know. You see, my basic 12 question is: Why -- look, two appeals; one judgment, 13 one sentence. Okay? January, June. You're prepared to 14 say the 1-year statute does not begin to -- to run until 15 June. Fine. The Rule 35 motion, when you took an 16 appeal, became final for purposes of the Federal habeas 17 statute in June. 18 So why doesn't the Rule 35 motion become 19 final under (1)(a) of the habeas statute, whenever 20 that's decided finally? Why is it collateral at all? 21 Why isn't it direct, just as your first one was direct? 22 MS. MIZNER: If the Rule 35 motion is filed 23 after the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirms the 24 judgment with - 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Wait a minute. Judgment of

2 MS. MIZNER: The judgment of conviction.

3 JUSTICE BREYER: -- or judgment of sentence?

6 JUSTICE BREYER: That's not the same reason

7 that it doesn't become final when you haven't appealed

8 your sentence yet, or when they haven't -- they didn't

9 consolidate.

10 I am quite confused, as you see, as to how

11 this all works in Rhode Island. I -- Rhode Island -- I

12 used to be on the First Circuit. I know it has some

13 special ways of doing things that are sometimes

14 different, and this is different.

15 MS. MIZNER: It is, Justice Breyer. And I

16 have not seen any Rhode Island cases addressing a

17 Rule 35 motion that was not filed after the judgment of

18 conviction had been affirmed in the context of looking

19 for a discretionary reduction of sentence.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: There must be in Rhode

21 Island some complaints about the sentence.

3 JUSTICE ALITO: What would happen if the

4 statutory maximum for an offense in Rhode Island is 5

5 years and the sentencing judge imposes a sentence of 10

6 years, and the defense attorney at that time says, well,

7 you can't do that, that's more than a statutory maximum;

8 and the judge goes ahead with it, and then an appeal is

9 taken?

10 You're saying that the appellate court in

11 Rhode Island would not entertain that argument? They

12 would say you have to go back and make a Rule 35 motion

13 in the trial court? Maybe that's the procedure.

14 MS. MIZNER: That is -

21 JUSTICE ALITO: Could I return you to

23 review" is a legal term of art, or is it a term that we

24 can -- we should interpret simply by looking up the word

25 "collateral" in a dictionary?

Alderson Reporting Company

45 1 MS. MIZNER: Well, this Court has discussed 2 the -- has used the term "collateral review" in a -- a 3 number of different contexts, in civil cases, in habeas 4 cases, in the -- in the manner of distinguishing between 5 direct review and something that is outside direct 6 review. 7 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't -- if I look up 8 "collateral attack" in Black's Law Dictionary, won't I 9 find a definition there? And won't it tell me that this 10 is something other than the proceeding? This is an 11 attack on a judgment outside of the proceeding that led 12 to the entry of that judgment. Isn't that what the term 13 generally means? 14 MS. MIZNER: "Collateral" generally means 15 supplementary, as defined in Black's, and "collateral 16 attack" in Black's is defined as an attack on a judgment 17 in a proceeding other than direct appeal. 18 JUSTICE ALITO: Right. 19 MS. MIZNER: But the Rule 35 motion in Rhode 20 Island is not part of a direct appeal. It is a 21 separate, specific - 22 JUSTICE ALITO: But it's part of the case. 23 MS. MIZNER: It is part of the case, 24 Justice Alito, but a -- a motion for a new trial based 25 on newly discovered evidence, which is viewed as
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 collateral, is also part of the original proceeding.

46

2 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what about just a

3 regular motion for a new trial, not based on newly -- on

4 newly discovered evidence? Is that collateral, or is -

5 is that part of the -- the criminal proceeding?

6 MS. MIZNER: The motions for new trial -- a

7 motion for a new trial that has to be filed within 10 or

8 14 days of the conviction would be part of the direct

9 appeal and therefore would be -- would not be

10 collateral. But a motion for a new trial that is filed

11 after the judgment is affirmed by a court of appeals and

12 the time for cert has passed would be collateral.

13 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what's wrong with the

14 argument that nothing that occurs in the criminal case

15 itself is collateral? What Congress had in mind when it

16 spoke about collateral review was something like habeas.

17 Let me give you an alternative

18 interpretation of this, and maybe it's completely wrong,

19 but you'll tell me why it's wrong.

20 "Post-conviction" is a term of art. Many

21 States, including Rhode Island, have postconviction

22 review statutes. So Congress wanted to have that time,

23 the time when those proceedings were tolled -- were

24 pending tolled. But not every State uses that phrase.

25 Not every State uses that term. They have other names

Alderson Reporting Company

47 1 for the proceeding, and that's what's meant by "other 2 collateral review." "Collateral review" is a term of 3 art. It's not something that you understand by looking 4 up the word "collateral" in a dictionary. 5 What's wrong with that? 6 MS. MIZNER: There is no indication that 7 Congress was limiting the use of the term "collateral 8 review" to a postconviction legal challenge. Congress 9 could have said that if it had wished. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm not saying it has to do 11 with whether it's legal or something else. It has to do 12 with whether it's in the criminal case or not in the 13 criminal case. 14 MS. MIZNER: Traditionally, motions that are 15 filed -- motions for a new trial are -- may be filed 16 after the judgment has been affirmed and have been 17 viewed by the courts as collateral, as collateral 18 review. So there is -- the tradition doesn't limit the 19 use of the term "collateral review" to a proceeding that 20 is completely separate and apart. 21 Indeed, a 2255, while it may be separately 22 filed, is then consolidated with the original 23 proceeding, and there's an entry in the docket -- you 24 shall not file any more pleadings in that separate case. 25 It all goes back to the original case. The 2255, which
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 is collateral, is heard by the trial court.

48

2 So there is a -- there is no reason to

3 assume that Congress was limiting collateral review to

4 something outside of the original proceeding.

5 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you -

6 JUSTICE ALITO: 2255 is -- is in the

7 original case, but it's a habeas substitute. It was

8 adopted by Congress as a substitute for habeas; isn't

9 that right?

10 MS. MIZNER: Yes.

11 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that a petition

12 for clemency that's presented to the governor would toll

13 the limitations period?

14 MS. MIZNER: No, I do not, Justice Kagan.

15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Why -- why is that

16 different?

17 MS. MIZNER: Because 2244(d)(2) is tolling

18 an application for review with respect to the pertinent

19 judgment or claim. And a -- an application for clemency

20 doesn't produce any change in the judgment that is

21 rendered by the court. It's not a request that is

22 related to the legal reasoning behind a judgment; it

23 doesn't challenge the basis for the judgment. And it's

24 an executive branch function, in some cases with advice

25 and consent of a legislative body. And there's no

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 judicial review. So it is -

49

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that may be right,

3 but I don't think that's the reason. I -- I thought we

4 had held that the word "filed" in the petition means

5 filed in a court, not filed with the governor. It's -

6 it's the word "filed" in -- in the tolling provision

7 that -- that does the work.

8 MS. MIZNER: I would agree.

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You think it doesn't

10 matter that -- I mean, a Rule 35 motion is a motion made

11 in the original criminal proceeding, not to the side of

12 it. So isn't a collateral attack a sort of -- another

13 proceeding to the side of the main proceeding, but the

14 Rule 35 motion is filed in the criminal proceeding

15 itself?

16 MS. MIZNER: Yes, it is, Justice Ginsburg,

17 as is a Rule 33 motion for a new trial based on newly

18 discovered evidence, which courts have held to be

19 collateral. It's a question of -- of when these motions

20 are filed that makes them collateral. They are not part

21 of the direct review process.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: So if this was -- if this

23 motion had been filed before judgment, which can happen,

24 before the judgment is final, then there would be no

25 tolling?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
50 1 MS. MIZNER: Tolling would not come into - 2 into play until after the judgment has become final. If 3 this has been addressed and - 4 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the question - 5 MS. MIZNER: -- resolved prior to, it would 6 have no impact on tolling. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the answer is yes. This 8 motion which can be filed either before or after 9 judgment -- the time is tolled if it's made after the 10 judgment but not if it's made before. 11 MS. MIZNER: Yes. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There seems to be some 13 confusion. Judgment is rendered before this motion is 14 made. There's a conviction and there's a sentence, 15 right? 16 MS. MIZNER: Yes. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there's a judgment 18 rendered. That's different from whether the judgment is 19 final in a Federal sense. It's final as far as the 20 State is concerned, because the judgment was rendered, 21 correct? 22 MS. MIZNER: Well, the judgment would become 23 final as far as the State is concerned, if on appeal, if 24 there is an appeal and the Rhode Island Supreme Court 25 has affirmed.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
51 1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But if there's no 2 appeal, it was final the day it was rendered. 3 MS. MIZNER: Yes. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As far as the State is 5 concerned. If there is an appeal, then it may undo 6 that, correct? 7 MS. MIZNER: Yes. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there is a judgment, 9 and this is always post-judgment. 10 MS. MIZNER: Yes. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- well, that's not - 12 that's not what the State says, anyway. The State says, 13 and I think the way 35 reads, it doesn't have to be 14 filed after judgment. 15 MS. MIZNER: It has to be filed within 16 121 days after the entry -- after the sentence. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. It can't be 18 filed any later than that. But it doesn't say that it 19 can't be filed before judgment. 20 MS. MIZNER: It would have to be filed after 21 the sentence is imposed. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. 23 MS. MIZNER: And the sentence - 24 JUSTICE SCALIA: When does -- when does it 25 become final? When does the -- even at the trial court
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 level, when does it become final?

52

2 MS. MIZNER: I would say that the -- it

3 becomes final when it is imposed.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

5 Mr. Weisman, you have 6 minutes remaining.

6 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AARON L. WEISMAN

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8 MR. WEISMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

9 I'll begin -- if I could just clarify

10 regarding the scope of Rule 35. The reporter's notes to

11 Rule 35 do make it very clear that an illegal sentence

12 is one which has been imposed after a valid conviction

13 but is not authorized under law. It includes, e.g., a

14 sentence in excess of that provided by statute,

15 imposition of an unauthorized form of punishment, a

16 judgment that does not conform to the oral sentence.

17 And our supreme court has gone on to explain this

18 provision by saying: We have never -- we have never

19 countenanced a challenge to the constitutionality of a

20 penal statute in the context of a Rule 35 motion, nor

21 have we declared that a sentence imposed pursuant to an

22 unconstitutional statute is illegal as contemplated by

23 Rule 35.

24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, I -- you were

25 speaking so fast, I didn't follow you.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
53 1 MR. WEISMAN: I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor. 2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Perhaps we can go back 3 to the simple question, which is, can a defendant who 4 has been sentenced bring a challenge to a sentence in a 5 direct appeal or not? Or do they have to go by Rule 6 35(a)? 7 MR. WEISMAN: Although there is dicta and 8 some language where our supreme court says essentially 9 file challenges to your sentences pursuant to Rule 35, 10 it is clear that only certain types of challenges can be 11 brought in a Rule 35 motion. In the run of the mill 12 cases, they have to be brought if there is an appellate 13 record in direct appeal, or most commonly they're 14 brought pursuant to the State's postconviction relief. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So now we 16 get to the point where some can go under 35(a) but some 17 can't. 18 MR. WEISMAN: Right. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So they should go on 20 direct appeal, correct? 21 MR. WEISMAN: The only ones that are correct 22 under 35(a) are, again, where the sentence is not 23 authorized by law or has imposed an unauthorized form of 24 punishment or a judgment that - 25 JUSTICE BREYER: That's called "it's
Alderson Reporting Company

1 illegal."

Official - Subject to Final Review

54

2 MR. WEISMAN: Correct. Correct.

3 JUSTICE BREYER: So now it's illegal.

4 MR. WEISMAN: Correct, but -

5 JUSTICE BREYER: And the odd thing is that

6 -- that kind of appeal takes place either days or

7 possibly weeks after the defendant may already have

8 appealed his conviction to the higher court.

9 MR. WEISMAN: Well -- correct.

10 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right?

11 MR. WEISMAN: That is correct.

12 JUSTICE BREYER: That normally happens?

13 MR. WEISMAN: Correct.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: And what I'm curious about

15 is what happens if the court affirms that sentence,

16 let's say 2 months after it already affirmed the

17 conviction?

18 MR. WEISMAN: Right. And our -

19 JUSTICE BREYER: Which is the judgment

20 pursuant to which -- which is the judgment that became

21 final by conclusion of direct review?

22 MR. WEISMAN: And our position would be

23 that's not part of the direct review appellate process.

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Why?

25 MR. WEISMAN: That the --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
55 1 JUSTICE BREYER: The person is not being 2 held in custody pursuant to a judgment of the State 3 court, or at least a relevant judgment, until the 4 sentence has been appealed. Then there's the conclusion 5 of direct review in respect to the judgment in respect 6 to which he is being held in custody. I'm just reading 7 the statute - 8 MR. WEISMAN: Yes. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- the Federal statute. 10 MR. WEISMAN: But, Your Honor, that could 11 occur at any time. That can occur 5 or 10 years or 12 20 years later. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. 14 MR. WEISMAN: And we're not - 15 JUSTICE BREYER: And that's why I don't - 16 that's why I am confused. I look at the language of the 17 Federal statute and it seems to me that this individual 18 is not being held in custody pursuant to a judgment 19 until that sentence is final. 20 MR. WEISMAN: But we would suggest - 21 JUSTICE BREYER: And the sentence is final 22 in the lower court, but they say when the sentence is 23 final at the conclusion of direct review in respect to 24 that sentence, which hasn't even taken place yet. 25 MR. WEISMAN: Yes, but our point would be,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
56 1 Your Honor, that it doesn't move the start of the 1-year 2 limitations period. The start of the 1-year limitations 3 period, as this Court said in Jiminez v. Quarterman, 4 begins when it begins. It begins when that judgment 5 becomes final, which is 90 days after our supreme court 6 affirms the judgment of conviction. It's final. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then you're going to 8 say - 9 MR. WEISMAN: It doesn't - 10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- all appeals in Rhode 11 Island from sentences -- all appeals on their lawfulness 12 or their mercy take place under Rule 35, and all of them 13 are collateral. 14 MR. WEISMAN: No. What we -- respectfully, 15 what we're going to say is collateral review refers to 16 those, as this Court said in Duncan v. Walker, habeas 17 postconviction relief vehicles that -- that occur after 18 the conviction has become final. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm totally confused. 20 If this is part of the criminal proceeding, which is 21 your position, that it's not collateral, but it's part 22 of the proceedings, when does this proceeding become 23 final? 24 MR. WEISMAN: It becomes final - 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- that truly --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 because -- you're -- you're -

57

2 MR. WEISMAN: Well, under Jiminez v. Walker,

3 it becomes final when -- 90 days from when the supreme

4 court affirms the conviction.

5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But if the Rhode Island

6 court has told litigants that they can't challenge some

7 portions of an illegal sentence except by way of Rule

8 35, how can we call the decision on the affirmance of

9 the conviction a final determination of the legality of

10 the sentence? That's contradictory.

11 MR. WEISMAN: Because Congress has decided

12 to pick the day on which the appeal becomes -- the

13 conviction becomes final, which always occurs 90 days

14 after the State's high court -

15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that's not -

16 that's not what the -- what it says. It talks about a

17 judgment. And a judgment in -- in other terms is

18 usually the conviction and the sentence. Rhode Island

19 for its own reasons has separated the two, but -

20 MR. WEISMAN: Yes, but Congress has set four

21 dates on which the conviction becomes final.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

23 The case is submitted.
