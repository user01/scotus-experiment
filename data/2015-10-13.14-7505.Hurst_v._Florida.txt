4 next in Case No. 147505, Hurst v. Florida.

5             Mr. Waxman.

6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

7               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8             MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10             Under Florida law, Timothy Hurst will go to

11 his death despite the fact that a judge, not a jury,

12 made the factual finding that rendered  rendered him

13 eligible for death.  That violates the Sixth Amendment

14 under Ring.  In Florida, and Florida alone, what

15 authorizes imposition of the death penalty is a finding

16 of fact by the Court of an aggravating factor, a finding

17 that the trial judge makes independently, and, quote,

18 "notwithstanding the jury's recommendation as to

19 sentence."

20             Now, the State here contends that capital

21 sentencing juries make implicit findings that satisfy

22 the Sixth Amendment under Ring, which the trial judge

23 then simply ratifies.  That is wrong.

24             Whatever the jury's recommendation might

25 imply about the specified aggravating factors, the

Alderson Reporting Company

4 1 Florida Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected the notion 2 that the jury's verdict is anything other than advisory. 3 Florida law entrusts the factual findings of aggravators 4 to the judge alone, who may do so on the basis of 5 evidence that the jury never heard, and aggravators that 6 the jury was never presented with. 7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is there ever a case in 8 which the jury found aggravators and recommended the 9 death sentence, and the judge reversed that finding? 10             MR. WAXMAN:  There may well be.  This is 11 principally a case about the finding of death 12 eligibility, not sentence selection.  I  13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I mean, either  14 either way, is  is there  is there  15             MR. WAXMAN:  Yes. 16             JUSTICE SCALIA:   is there ever a case in 17 which the jury did not find an aggravating circumstance, 18 but the judge did? 19             MR. WAXMAN:  Well, we don't ever know what 20 the jury found about any of the specified aggravating 21 circumstances.  The only thing that the jury tells the 22 judge is, we recommend lifeslashdeath by a vote of X 23 versus Y. 24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  But they can't 25 recommend death unless they find the aggravator, right?

5 1             MR. WAXMAN:  Well, no.  No.  As a matter of 2 State law, that's not correct.  They can't recommend 3 death unless seven of them each believe that some 4 aggravator is satisfied. 5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right. 6             MR. WAXMAN:  But the Florida Supreme 7 Court  and this is a  this is a  another Ring 8 problem here.  The Florida Supreme Court has recognized 9 that where two aggravators are presented, it is 10 impossible to know, even if a simple majority agreed on 11 a single aggravator. 12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's a 13 common feature, though, of jury deliberations.  Let's 14 say an aggravator is whether the murder is  is 15 particularly heinous.  And it can be for  for a number 16 of factors:  One, the victim is a  a  a juvenile, so 17 maybe three jurors find that.  Or an officer was also 18 killed, or it was in the commission  in the course of 19 another felony. 20             In a typical case, a finding that the murder 21 was heinous, you have no idea whether the juror  jury 22 as a whole made that determination, or if there were 12 23 different reasons. 24             MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, Florida, 25 and  Florida is the only State  the only death

6 1 penalty State and therefore the only State that does not 2 require or permit the jury to be told that it has to 3 agree.  And in all other States it's unanimous, but even 4 has to  cannot even be told that a majority have to 5 agree as to the existence of one of the specified 6 aggravating factors. 7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but isn't that 8 true  I mean, taking it even out of the death penalty 9 context, that's true with every jury determination.  You 10 could have the jury determining that the  the  11 the  you know, the  the person didn't commit the 12 offense because his alibi was good, or because, you 13 know, somebody else did it, or, you know, any number of 14 12 different reasons that they think he was not guilty. 15 It doesn't  16             MR. WAXMAN:  It  17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   have to be 18 agreement by the jury on a  on the particular basis 19 for their verdict. 20             MR. WAXMAN:  We're talking here, Mr. Chief 21 Justice, about elements of the crime.  And as this Court 22 explained in Ring, the existence of a statutory 23 aggravating factor is an element of a deatheligible 24 crime. 25             And can anybody imagine a world, which would
Alderson Reporting Company

1 be the analogue in Florida, if the jury at the

7

2 guilt/innocence phase of any trial, a shoplifting trial,

3 were told, now, look.  I'm the one who will decide

4 whether the defendant is or isn't guilty as a matter of

5 law, and  and eligible for punishment.  But I'd like

6 your input on what you  whether you think each of the

7 specified elements is or isn't satisfied.  I mean,

8 that  nobody would stand for an argument like that 

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not sure.  You 

10 you 

11             MR. WAXMAN:   or a system like that.

12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are you sure that  that

13 if you have a crime that can be satisfied by various

14 elements, the jury has to agree upon the specific

15 element that satisfies it?

16             MR. WAXMAN:  The jury  if they are

17 distinct elements, and this  this implies the Schad

18 point that the State is raising:  If the State,

19 consistent with a long historical tradition and a

20 finding of equal culpability, chooses to permit a

21 particular element in Schad, it was premeditation, or

22 the mental state to be satisfied either by premeditation

23 or by felony murder, that's fine.

24             But that is not the Florida system.  Florida

25 requires as a matter of law  and the Florida Supreme

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Court has said this over and over again  that a

8

2 defendant is eligible for death only if the trial judge

3 finds as fact, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a

4 particular statutory aggravator exists.

5             And I submit, even if that were not the

6 case, extending Schad, which held that in light of a

7 hundredandfiftyyear history of States including in

8 the mental element for first degree murder, either

9 felony murder or premeditation, that combining those two

10 elements didn't satisfy the death penalty.  None of that

11 is here.

12             This is a question of the Sixth Amendment

13 and the Eighth Amendment.  No State ever has said that

14 the jury can just decide some model of aggravation.

15 They just  they don't agree on the specific element,

16 and that would violate, I think, the Sixth and Eighth

17 Amendment precedents.

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I  I  I would think

19 that the  I would think just the opposite, that that

20 the necessity of finding the elements of the crime goes

21 all the way back into the mists of history.

22             And this necessity of finding an

23 aggravator  aggravating factor, we made it up, right?

24 I mean, that's just recent Supreme Court law.

25             MR. WAXMAN:  Just 

Alderson Reporting Company

9 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And so if  if even one of 2 them should be satisfiable by simply finding the generic 3 conclusion rather than agreeing upon the  the 4 particular species at issue, I would think it's  5 it's  it's the latter, rather than the former. 6             MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Scalia, I'm reminded of 7 your separate opinion  I think it was in Walton v. 8 Arizona  where you were choosing between two things 9 that you didn't particularly like, and one of them was 10 the fact that the Court had made, recently or not, had 11 made a finding of a  beyond a reasonable doubt, a 12 factual finding of a specified aggravating factor an 13 element of the crime.  And whether it's recent, whether 14 the court should or shouldn't have done it, it has.  And 15 it  under Ring, it is just like any other element of 16 the crime. 17             And on the Schad point, I think the other 18 thing I would have said is, the Florida Supreme Court  19 and I'll refer the case  the Court to the Bevel 20 case  the Florida Supreme Court has said that the 16 21 aggravating factors that it  that makes one eligible 22 for death are vastly incommensurate, in terms of 23 relative levels of  24             JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Waxman  25             MR. WAXMAN:   moral ability, opposite of

1 the predicate of Schad.

2             JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I ask you this about

3 Ring?  I wasn't on the Court at the time of Ring, so

4 could you tell me if Ring is entitled to greater weight

5 as a precedent than, let's say, Gregg v. Georgia and the

6 other cases upholding the constitutionality of the death

7 penalty?

8             MR. WAXMAN:  Oh, I'm not  I  I wouldn't

9 be prepared to say  to assign weight to either of

10 them.

11             I think Ring is certainly predicated on

12 Gregg, to Justice Scalia's point.  If Gregg hadn't

13 decided that  that there has to be a determinate,

14 specific appellate reviewable narrowing of trial 

15 sentencing jury's discretion, Ring wouldn't come up,

16 because an aggravating factor wouldn't be an element.

17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think this

18 scheme, assuming we agree with Justice Scalia, that you

19 don't really need unanimity, would this still be good

20 law under Apodaca  Apodaca 

21             MR. WAXMAN:  Well 

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   the case that said

23 that we  we needed a unanimous jury, but, you know,

24 nine out of twelve is okay?  Do you  do you think

25 seven out of five is okay?

Alderson Reporting Company

11 1             MR. WAXMAN:  I hope it was clear from our 2 brief that we think  3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's not. 4             MR. WAXMAN:   nine out of five is not 5 okay.  It doesn't require this Court to overrule 6 Apodaca, which  7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We're not required to do 8 anything.  We could just say it's not the functional 9 equivalent.  But is  10             MR. WAXMAN:  Well  11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But is it still good 12 law? 13             MR. WAXMAN:  Well, six  14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Shouldn't we overrule 15 it? 16             MR. WAXMAN:  I  we think, for the reasons 17 stated in our brief, you should overrule it.  And 18 particularly in the Eighth Amendment context where the 19 question is death, the jury should be unanimous. 20             I mean, there is no other State that permits 21 anyone to be sentenced for death other than a unanimous 22 determination by the jury.  And the State of Florida 23 requires unanimity for shoplifting, just not for death. 24 It requires unanimity on all the other elements of the 25 crime.
Alderson Reporting Company

12 1             Now, even  Apodaca's is a  is an unusual 2 decision, as Justice  3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, wait a minute. 4 They  they  they require unanimity for the  for a 5 conviction, right? 6             MR. WAXMAN:  Yes.  And conviction  7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just  just  just they 8 don't require unanimity on the sentence.  That's quite 9 different from  10             MR. WAXMAN:  Justice  11             JUSTICE SCALIA:   from whether the person 12 committed the crime or not. 13             MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Scalia  exactly. 14 And, Justice Scalia, leaving aside our Eighth Amendment 15 point in our brief that  that followed on Justice 16 Breyer's concurrence in Ring, the  this is all about 17 the eligibility, not the determination of what sentence 18 applies.  And you have held that the existence of a 19 specified statutory aggravating factor is a condition. 20 It is an element of capital murder, and it is, by 21 statute and Florida Supreme Court decision, an element 22 of capital murder in Florida. 23             And in Apodaca itself, which, as  as 24 Justice Thomas pointed out in McDonald, is an 25 extraordinarily unusual case, even there, six justices
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 indicated that a simple majority rule would not pass

13

2 muster.

3             I mean, we need to  once a  at 

4 when  when an assignment is made to a jury in a case

5 to decide beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of an

6 element, however the State defines the element, we need

7 substantial reliability that the jury actually performs

8 those functions.

9             And in this case  and, again, in this

10 case, if it were true that the sentencing jury was

11 actually determining death eligibility, which it is

12 plainly not, as we point out, the Eighth Amendment would

13 certainly be violated under Caldwell, because this 

14 Florida juries are told that they do not determine death

15 eligibility.  And the State simply can't have it both

16 ways.  Either the jury is correctly told that its role

17 is merely advisory, in which case there is a Ring

18 violation, or the instruction that it's given violates

19 the Eighth Amendment under Caldwell, because, as in

20 Caldwell, it misleadingly, quote, "minimizes the jury's

21 sense of responsibility for determining the

22 appropriateness of death."

23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Waxman, do we  do

24 we just treat as irrelevant what was involved in this

25 case, that is, the two aggravators that were alleged,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
14 1 the brutality of the murder, and that it occurred during 2 a robbery?  Those were obvious that they existed.  Is 3 that not so? 4             MR. WAXMAN:  I think it's not so.  It's 5 probably a reason why  for  I mean, the heinous, 6 atrocious, and cruel aggravator can never be obvious. 7 And the State isn't even arguing harmlessness with 8 respect to that. 9             And as to robbery, I think it's important 10 to  to recognize the following:  The State made a 11 choice.  They didn't even indite Timothy Hurst for 12 robbery.  The sentencing jury was not even instructed on 13 the elements of robbery.  This argument of harmlessness 14 was never raised in these proceedings from the 15 sentencing proceeding onward, including in the brief in 16 opposition in this case, until the Red brief, and even 17 there the Red brief is simply arguing that there was a 18 fatal concession. 19             But in any event, Justice Ginsburg, there is 20 evidence in the record from which a jury could certainly 21 find that Timothy Hurst, although he was found guilty of 22 firstdegree murder, did not, in fact, actually commit 23 the robbery.  The jury was told that to find the 24 existence of the felony murder aggravator, it had to 25 find  and I believe this is on Page 211 of the Joint
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Appendix  that it had to find that the murder was

15

2 committed while he  in the course of him committing a

3 robbery.  All of the physical evidence in this case that

4 relates to the robbery, the  the  the bank deposit

5 slip, the money, the bank deposit envelope, and a piece

6 of paper in LeeLee Smith's handwriting toting up the

7 proceeds were all found in LeeLee Smith's possession.

8             And so, although it is not this Court's

9 ordinary function to determine whether something was or

10 wasn't harmless, as in Ring it was remanded for that

11 purpose, I think in this case it manifestly was not

12 harmless.  And if there were a remand or any question by

13 this Court on that count, it ought to be remanded to the

14 State court, not only to determine constitutional

15 harmlessness, but whether there was a waiver by the

16 State in its deliberate choice never to mention this

17 either to the second sentencing jury or thereafter.

18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Waxman, am  am I

19 understanding the case properly?  The informant, who had

20 all of the physical evidence, was the main identifier of

21 the defendant, correct?

22             MR. WAXMAN:  Correct.

23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And 

24             MR. WAXMAN:  Because there were  there

25 were  there was an eyewitness from across the street

16 1 who testified that he saw somebody go into the Popeye's, 2 and he positively identified the defendant. 3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, did  4             MR. WAXMAN:  Now, I believe there was 5 another cooperator who backed up LeeLee Smith's 6 testimony. 7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the defendant 8 claimed, however, that this informant was the one who 9 did the crime. 10             Could the jury, under the evidence that 11 existed, concluded that they both did it? 12             MR. WAXMAN:  Certainly. 13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that's why it's 14 debatable whether it's harmless? 15             MR. WAXMAN:  Yes.  And, in fact  16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because what makes it an 17 aggravator is if he's the one who actually did the 18 killing. 19             MR. WAXMAN:  That's correct. 20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That he wasn't  21             MR. WAXMAN:  Well, that's what the jury was 22 instructed. 23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Uhhuh. 24             MR. WAXMAN:  The jury was instructed that in 25 order to find the felony murder aggravator, it had to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
17 1 find that the murder was committed in the course of him 2 committing the robbery. 3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Personally. 4             MR. WAXMAN:  Yes. 5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  That's  6             MR. WAXMAN:  But the  the statute, the 7 actual aggravator, is different.  But that is what this 8 jury was told. 9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Waxman, can  can I 10 give you a  a hypothetical State system?  And this is 11 a twopart question.  You tell me if it is consistent 12 with the Sixth Amendment.  And if it is, what makes this 13 case different.  Okay? 14             So my system is that a jury, whether in the 15 penalty phase or in the guilt phase, has to make a 16 determination of an aggravating factor.  Okay?  But once 17 that's done, once the jury decides on an aggravating 18 factor, the judge can do whatever she wants.  The judge 19 can add aggravating factors.  The judge can reweigh the 20 aggravating factors as compared with the mitigating 21 evidence.  The judge can do any of that stuff. 22             But the judge has to leave alone the 23 aggravating factor that the jury finds.  So, in other 24 words, the judge can't give death when the jury finds 25 life, and the judge can't throw out the jury's factor.

18 1 But  but as long as that jury makes that aggravating 2 factor determination, the judge can do anything.  Is 3 that consistent with the Sixth Amendment? 4             MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  You're  you're asking 5 only about the Sixth Amendment and not the Eighth 6 Amendment  7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes. 8             MR. WAXMAN:   point.  Okay.  So the  so 9 just to be sure that I'm specifically answering your 10 question, if the jury is told, you must find  for the 11 defendant to be eligible for death, you must find beyond 12 a reasonable doubt the existence of at least one of the 13 statutory aggravating factors.  And I would also say for 14 Sixth Amendment purposes, you must either be unanimous 15 or the vote must be at least ten to two.  And then the 16 jury does so find.  And then you have the sort of 17 beltandsuspenders legal system that the State is 18 positing that Florida has here where the judge can say, 19 okay, I'm the one who does the sentence, so I can weigh 20 the ags and the mits.  I can't  he is death eligible 21 because the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that a 22 statutory aggravator exists.  But the judge can say, 23 nonetheless, I'm giving life.  There's nothing  24 there's no violation of the Sixth Amendment in  when 25 that happens.

1             The question is, in this case, when the

19

2 sentencing jury has concluded its work  I mean  and

3 I'm assuming in a case where there's not a conviction

4 for a prior aggravated felony.  When the sentencing jury

5 has concluded its work, is the defendant eligible for

6 the death penalty under State law?  Yes or no.  And in

7 Florida, the answer is unquestionably no.

8             Even if we knew that 12 of the jurors found

9 the robbery aggravator here, there would be a Ring

10 violation, just as if we knew that 12 of the jurors

11 found that he had killed the defendant in this case, but

12 they had been told, I just want your input on this

13 because I, the judge, will decide this.

14             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, is that what  is

15 that what makes a difference, then, in the end, that 

16 that  that you're saying that the jury has to be

17 specifically told that that's what it's doing?  That 

18 and you're saying 

19             MR. WAXMAN:  The jury, no.

20             JUSTICE KAGAN:   the necessary part of a

21 constitutional system for the jury to be instructed that

22 it has the responsibility to find the aggravating factor

23 that serves as a precondition to death.

24             MR. WAXMAN:  At a minimum, if, in fact, the

25 jury is performing that function, it cannot, at least in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
20 1 a capital case, be told that it is not performing that 2 function, that its advice is  that its verdict is only 3 advisory. 4             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But  5             JUSTICE ALITO:  What if it's told that it 6 has to decide on life or death, but the judge is  if 7 you decide on death, the judge is going to review it, 8 and the judge has the power to sentence to life. 9             MR. WAXMAN:  If the  I mean, there is no 10 constitutional violation  our view  and this again 11 is, is Justice Breyer's Eighth Amendment point, which we 12 endorse.  Our view is that capital sentencing always has 13 be  has been and, as a matter of constitutional law, 14 should be done by a jury.  We're not arguing that other 15 sentences have to be jury sentencing.  And so if a 16 jury  if a jury says it's death, and the judge says, 17 well, I disagree, I'm only going to sentence him to 18 life, there's no constitutional violation. 19             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I'm trying to 20 understand the limits of your argument that what is done 21 under the Florida statute diminishes the jury's sense of 22 responsibility.  The jury's sense of responsibility will 23 be diminished to some degree if they know that their 24 verdict is not necessarily the final word. 25             MR. WAXMAN:  Well 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
21 1             JUSTICE ALITO:  Would that be the case  2 isn't that case whether they  whether they're told, 3 you  you make a recommendation and the judge decides, 4 or you impose a sentence, but the judge can impose a 5 different sentence, a lesser sentence?  There's still  6 they  they still don't have to bear the responsibility 7 of making the absolutely final decision. 8             MR. WAXMAN:  So, Justice  Justice Alito, 9 let me separate out what I'm calling the selection 10 decision, that is, life or death and the weighing of ags 11 and mits and the eligibility decision, which is all of 12 the elements of capital murder have been found by  13 beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury with either 14 unanimously or a sufficient majority, and, therefore, 15 when the sentencing jury is done, you are eligible for 16 the death penalty. 17             Leaving aside the Eighth Amendment question 18 whether the Constitution then require  requires the 19 jury to make the intensely moral judgment about whether 20 the penalty should be life without parole or death, 21 assuming that a judge can do that, so long as the jury 22 is not told that its input, which is how the Florida 23 Supreme Court has put it, is  so long as they are not 24 told that it's advisory, so long as they are told that 25 you as the finders of fact have to find that beyond a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 reasonable doubt that this capital crime was committed, 2 which includes the following elements, including one of 3 the two specifying aggravators, the Constitution is 4 satisfied. 5             The  the Caldwell problem is an Eighth 6 Amendment problem.  Caldwell was an Eighth Amendment 7 case.  And in Caldwell what  I mean what the jury is 8 told here  if the system exists as the State posits 9 it, what the jury is told here is far more misleading 10 than what was told in Caldwell. 11             In Caldwell, the jury was simply told at 12 closing argument that your decision is going to be 13 reviewable by the Mississippi Supreme Court.  And a 14 majority of this Court held that that unconstitutionally 15 diminished the jury's responsibility. 16             Here the jury was told over and over and 17 over again, and consistent with Florida law, that your 18 judgment is merely advisory; I will be the one to make 19 this determination.  And either  if that isn't  that 20 does appear to be the system, that violates Ring.  If it 21 isn't the system and if somehow it can be argued that 22 the jury is making implicit findings of aggravation at 23 large, that renders somebody eligible for death, then 24 there is a plain Caldwell problem.  And that  that's 25 our position.

5               ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN WINSOR

6                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7             MR. WINSOR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8 please the Court:

9             Florida's capital sentencing system was

10 constitutional before Ring v. Arizona, and it remains

11 constitutional in light of Ring v. Arizona.  What Ring

12 required was a jury determination on those facts on

13 which the State legislature conditions the imposition of

14 the death penalty.

15             In this instance Mr. Hurst got that.  The

16 legislature has determined that the elements necessary

17 to make a defendant eligible for the death penalty is

18 the existence of a murder and one or more aggravating

19 circumstances.

20             And what the other side calls the advisory

21 sentence included within it a finding, as this Court

22 recognized in the United States v. Jones, that the jury

23 had determined there was one or more aggravating

24 circumstances.

25             And so the jury

24 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  How  how 2 is that, when Florida law says that the judge has to 3 find an aggravator to make someone eligibility for the 4 death penalty? 5             MR. WINSOR:  Well, I agree with the other 6 side that there is a difference between the sentence 7 selection and the sentence eligibility.  And so once the 8 defendant is eligible because a jury has found all of 9 the necessary elements, then what happens after that, 10 Your Honor, does not implicate Ring at all. 11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me how 12 this is different than Arizona?  I mean, in terms of the 13 system, just like in the Arizona case, there had been 14 precedent by this Court that Arizona law had been 15 constitutional.  Unlike Arizona, every Florida  every 16 court that has looked  every judge who's looked at it, 17 not one of them has said that they believe personally 18 it's constitutional.  Even the courts affirming  19 affirm on the basis of the prior precedent, and you have 20 a little less than half the Court directly saying it 21 violates Ring.  So what's the jury finding when it says 22 seven to five? 23             MR. WINSOR:  Well, if I could back up  24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even when it says a 25 murder has been committed, felony murder wasn't.  Felony

25 1 murder was charged, but we don't know if they found the 2 robbery, right? 3             MR. WINSOR:  We  at the guilt phase they 4 convicted of first degree murder, which could have 5 either been felony murder with the predicate underlying 6 felony being robbery or premeditated murder.  But to 7 answer your earlier question about the actual  8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how do we know which 9 one they picked? 10             MR. WINSOR:  I'm sorry? 11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Which  how do we know 12 which one they picked?  Which makes them eligible for 13 the death penalty? 14             MR. WINSOR:  Well, our position is that 15 they  that he became eligible at the  at the 16 sentencing phase when the jury made its advisory 17 decision, because the jury at that phase was instructed, 18 that if you determine that no aggravating circumstances 19 are found to exist, you must recommend life. 20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you do agree that 21 that  it doesn't require a unanimous jury? 22             MR. WINSOR:  It does not require a unanimous 23 jury. 24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It  and  a simple 25 majority is all you need?

1             MR. WINSOR:  That's right.

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So we don't have 

3             MR. WINSOR:  That's right, but that's 

4 that's a jury finding.

5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   a unanimous jury,

6 even a functionally equivalent unanimous jury, finding

7 those aggravators.

8             MR. WINSOR:  I'm sorry?

9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We don't have a

10 unanimous or functionally unanimous jury finding those

11 aggravators.

12             MR. WINSOR:  Our reliance for the  the

13 final eligibility determination is that seven to five.

14             But I would make this point:  The seven to

15 five  there are two things that go on when the  when

16 the jury determines whether someone should be sentenced

17 to death or not.

18             First, the jury looks and determines whether

19 the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt an

20 aggravating circumstance.  That's the eligibility piece

21 of it.

22             Then they get into the sentence selection

23 process where they weigh the aggravators that they do

24 find, assuming they find some, against the mitigating

25 circumstances.  And of course the defendant under this

Alderson Reporting Company

27 1 Court's precedent is allowed to put in any evidence that 2 he wishes. 3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  The jury is 4 not asked to find an aggravator. 5             MR. WINSOR:  I'm sorry? 6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's not asked to find 7 an aggravator. 8             MR. WINSOR:  It is, Your Honor.  It is 9 instructed that it may not return a death recommendation 10 without  11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know.  But that's not 12 found at the jury verdict. 13             MR. WINSOR:  I'm sorry? 14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's not found at the 15 trial  after  16             MR. WINSOR:  At the sentencing phase. 17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're  only at the 18 sentencing phase. 19             MR. WINSOR:  I'm talking about the 20 sentencing phase right  21             JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose that the jury comes 22 back at the sentencing phase and says, we recommend 23 life. 24             MR.

5 give death.

6             MR. WINSOR:  No.  Not unless

8             MR. WINSOR:  With this caveat.

9             JUSTICE BREYER:  No, we  we have  they

10 have a page in their opinion, in their brief, you know,

11 Page 20, where it cites about six Florida cases, which

12 suggested to me that they thought the answer to that

13 question as a matter of Florida law was, yes, the judge

14 can sentence to death.

15             MR. WINSOR:  Yeah.  Let me  let me

17             MR. WINSOR:  Let me be clear:  As a matter

18 of Florida statutory law, it is permitted.  We

19 acknowledge that under Ring it would not be permitted in

20 the circumstance where the State is relying on the

21 recommendation to satisfy the eligibility.

22             Now, you could have a situation 

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  That's  I missed the last

9 doesn't, that the reason that they did that is no one

10 found an aggravator.

11             My simple question is:  As a matter of

12 Florida law, can the judge impose the death sentence?

13 Yes or no.

14             MR. WINSOR:  As a matter of Florida

15 statutory law, yes.  As a matter of Ring, no.  With

17 mean, it is.  It's Federal law.  So  I mean, Ring is

18 over.  So  so you say the answer is now no 

19             MR. WINSOR:  With this caveat, Justice

20 Breyer 

21             JUSTICE BREYER:   because of Ring.

22             Because you agree that this case is like

23 Ring, and therefore Ring would apply, and therefore 

24 not this case, but any case in which they recommend

25 life.

Alderson Reporting Company

1             MR. WINSOR:  Not any case, Your Honor.

30

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  God, I'd like to know your

3 caveat.  What is the caveat?  I'm  I'm on pins and

4 needles here.

5             MR. WINSOR:  The caveat is this 

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  I am, too, actually.

7             Sorry.

8             MR. WINSOR:  There are multiple ways that a

9 defendant in Florida can become eligible for death.

10             One is, in this case, where it's determined

11 at the sentencing phase because of the finding within

12 the jury's recommendation.

13             In other instances it can be  a person can

14 become eligible before the sentencing phase either

15 because they have a prior violent felony conviction or

16 because they have a contemporaneous conviction.

17             For example, if someone murdered two people

18 and were convicted of double murder, that person at the

19 guilt phase, by virtue of that guilt jury's verdict, has

20 been found to be eligible for the death penalty.

21             And so at that stage, then in your

22 hypothetical, Justice Breyer, if that sentencingphase

23 jury recommended life, the judge could override it

24 without violating Ring.

25             Now, I will tell you that, as a matter of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
31 1 Florida State law, the judge in that circumstance would 2 face an exacting standard; and, as a matter of fact, no 3 judge has overwritten a jury's life recommendation since 4 before Ring. 5             So as a matter of function, it is just not 6 something that happens in Florida. 7             But to answer your question, we do believe 8 it would be constitutional in the situation that I 9 described. 10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose the jury came in 11 hung. 12             MR. WINSOR:  I'm sorry? 13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  On  on the sentence. 14             MR. WINSOR:  If the sentencing phase  15             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The jury  jury, instead 16 of being seven to five, it was hung. 17             MR. WINSOR:  If the  18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could the judge then 19 impose the death penalty? 20             MR. WINSOR:  Not in this situation, Your 21 Honor, because that would result in a life 22 recommendation.  A sixsix vote is tantamount to a life 23 recommendation.  And the judge could not override that 24 if he were relying on the jury sentencing finding to 25 satisfy Ring.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
32 1             And even if he weren't, he or she weren't, 2 like I said, it's an exacting Florida State law 3 standard.  The judge would be reversed for overturning 4 that unless he  he or she determined  or unless the 5 appellate court determined that no reasonable jury in 6 those circumstances could have imposed or recommended a 7 life sentence. 8             And as I indicated, it's been since 1999 9 since any judge actually overrode a life recommendation. 10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just so I  I understand 11 it:  So you're saying that it  it is possible, but 12 under Florida law the jury would not find the existence 13 of an aggravated  aggravating factor but  and 14 would  and then there are different ways that this 15 would come out  the hypothetical was a hung jury  16 but the judge could then proceed to find an aggravating 17 factor and impose the death penalty. 18             Now, you say, now, this hasn't happened. 19 He'd probably be reversed.  But theoretically this could 20 happen. 21             MR. WINSOR:  Only  that could not happen 22 consistent with Ring, Your Honor, unless there were some 23 other jury finding or admission that established death 24 eligibility. 25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, you're saying it
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
33 1 couldn't happen consistent with Ring, meaning that there 2 are certain applications of the Florida law that would 3 be unconstitutional even in your view. 4             MR. WINSOR:  That hypothetical that we've 5 explored here  again, with their  with the absence 6 of another aggravating circumstance proven outside. 7             And  and that actually happens in most 8 cases, Justice Kagan. 9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But  but we don't  10 we  we don't sit in judgment of  of theoretical 11 scheme that Florida has set up, do we? 12             MR. WINSOR:  No, Your Honor, and  13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And don't we have to 14 adjudge that there has been unconstitutionality in this 15 case? 16             MR. WINSOR:  That's correct, Justice Scalia. 17 And in this case there was a  a jury recommendation, 18 actually two jury recommendations  19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could I give you another 20 hypothetical scheme, notwithstanding that we don't sit 21 in judgment of hypothetical schemes? 22             MR. WINSOR:  Sure. 23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Suppose that the  the  24 the jury finds an aggravating fact, but then, you know, 25 the judge has this whole separate hearing  right?

1 in which other things are presented to him.  And the

34

2 judge says, you know, I don't actually agree with the

3 aggravating fact that the jury found, but I have my own

4 aggravating facts, and now I'm  I'm doing all the

5 weighing and I come out in favor of death.

6             I  I assume that you would say that also

7 would be an unconstitutional application.

8             MR. WINSOR:  No, Your Honor.  That would be

9 consistent with Ring because, again, once death

10 eligibility  and  and there is a substantial

11 difference that this Court has recognized over the years

12 between the determination of who is eligible for death,

13 and then, of that universe of people eligible for death,

14 for whom is it appropriate?

15             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  Quite  quite right.

16 But I'm  I'm hypothesizing a case in which the jury

17 finds that deatheligibility marker 

18             MR. WINSOR:  Right.

19             JUSTICE KAGAN:   right?  If  but the

20 judge throws that one out and substitutes his own.

21 That  you think that would be constitutional?

22             MR. WINSOR:  Well, the judge in that

23 instance wouldn't be throwing it out.

24             JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, he does throw it out.

25 He just says, I don't agree with that.  I'm  but I'm

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 substituting my own.

35

2             Would that be all right?

3             MR. WINSOR:  That would be okay because

4 eligibility would have been determined.  Just like if,

5 in my double murder example, the judge believed that,

6 you know, if he were sitting on the jury, maybe he would

7 have acquitted that person of the  of the double

8 murder.

9             And of course he can't just override the

10 jury's verdict based on a mere disagreement.  In that

11 instance, the death eligibility was determined, not

12 withstanding that he had  he'd been the decision

13 maker, maybe would have decided differently.  The person

14 is eligible for death.  And then it's up to the

15 sentencer.

16             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I have to say that

17 answer surprises me because the death sentence there is

18 not at all a function of the jury's eligibility finding.

19 The judge has tossed out that eligibility finding and

20 substituted his own, which then leads to the death

21 sentence.

22             So how can we say that that's possibly

23 constitutional under Ring?

24             MR. WINSOR:  Because the point in Ring was

25 to make sure that no person was subject to a greater

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
36 1 penalty than they bargained for when they did the crime 2 without a jury finding.  And in your hypothetical, the 3 jury finds that there is an aggravator.  So there is a 4 jury finding that that person is entitled to the 5 punishment based on the crime that he or she committed. 6             JUSTICE KAGAN:  The judge has said that that 7 jury finding is utterly irrelevant to his decision about 8 whether to impose death.  That he's imposing death based 9 on something that the jury has not found. 10             MR. WINSOR:  But at that point the judge's 11 determination is separate from the  the selection 12 point.  The judge is exercising the discretion to 13 sentence within  a person who is determined by a jury 14 to be eligible for the death penalty. 15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That didn't happen here, 16 did it? 17             MR. WINSOR:  No, your Honor. 18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Good, I thought so  19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the thing is you can't 20 really tell whether that happens in a wide variety of 21 cases.  And this is actually  this goes to this 22 question of because the jury doesn't actually have to 23 find specific things, only the judge has to find 24 specific things, you often are not going to be able to 25 tell whether the judge's sentence is based on the same
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 aggravating facts that the jury has found.

37

2             MR. WINSOR:  But it doesn't need to be under

3 Ring, because once the jury has determined that there is

4 an aggravating factor or if it's been admitted, then the

5 person is death eligible and Ring is completely

6 finished.  There's nothing more to do under Ring.

7             And then we move 

8             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even though the jury is

9 told, now, whatever you say, it's advisory.  It's not

10 binding.  So you have made a finding of an aggravator,

11 but it's not a binding finder of an aggravator.  The

12 jury is told that whatever they say is advisory.

13             Doesn't that make a difference?

14             MR. WINSOR:  No.  What the jury is told is

15 that its ultimate recommendation is  is not binding on

16 the Court.

17             And that's true.  And that's one of the

18 great benefits of Florida's system.  I mean, Florida's

19 system was developed in response to this Court's

20 decision in Ferment, and this Court has said that the

21 Florida's system provides additional benefits to the

22 defendant.

23             So you have a judicial backstop.  The

24 matter 

25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was  that was

Alderson Reporting Company

2             MR. WINSOR:  That was before Ring.

3             And we're not contesting that Ring would

4 require a jury finding or an admission of those

5 elements.

6             But once the jury makes its recommendation,

7 even if it recommends death, the judge can override that

8 by  for any reason, just based on disagreement alone,

9 which makes it unlike, you know, in a usual capital 

10 or the  excuse me  a usual criminal proceeding where

11 the judge could not overcome 

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I just

13 want  I'm  I'm sorry.

14             Justice Scalia.

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it clear to the jury

16 that they are the last word on whether an aggravator

17 exists or not?

18             MR. WINSOR:  What it  what the jury is

19 told is that they cannot return a death recommendation

20 without finding a  an aggravating circumstance.

21 That's 

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But then they're also told

23 that the judge is ultimately going to decide whether

24 your recommendation stands or not.

25             MR. WINSOR:  The judge is going to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
39 1 ultimately impose the sentence, and that's true.  And 2 that's both true under Caldwell, but it's not  3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But shouldn't it be clear 4 to the jury that  that their determination of whether 5 an aggravator exists or not is final?  Shouldn't that be 6 clear? 7             MR. WINSOR:  Well, I  I don't think so, 8 Your Honor, because the determination of the aggravator 9 doesn't yield a death sentence unless the judge, in his 10 or her own opinion, believes the death is appropriate. 11 That's a benefit. 12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But I'm  I'm talking  13 I'm talking about what responsibility the jury feels. 14 If the jury knows that if  if  if we don't  if  15 if we don't find it an aggravator, it can't be found; or 16 if we do find an aggravator, it must be accepted. 17 That's a lot more responsibility than just, you know, 18 well, you know, if you find an aggravator and you  you 19 weigh it and provide for the death penalty, the judge is 20 going to review it anyway. 21             MR. WINSOR:  I'm not sure that's an accurate 22 characterization of what goes on because it's not that 23 the judge must accept  the aggravator determination 24 has no purpose or no point other than determining 25 eligibility and then the weighing.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
40 1             And if the judge determines that the death 2 sentence is not appropriate for whatever reason, then 3 the fact that the jury found an aggravating circumstance 4 makes no difference. 5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose then in your 6 earlier hypothetical, the judge  the jury finds an 7 aggravator occurred in the course of the robbery, and, 8 therefore, there is death eligibility.  Then it goes to 9 the judge.  And the judge says, there is simply no 10 evidence to support that aggravating factor, but I find 11 another aggravating factor.  Under your view, the judge 12 could go ahead and impose the death penalty? 13             MR. WINSOR:  Well, in that instance, that's 14 a little bit different, as I understand it, than Justice 15 Kagan's hypothetical. 16             First of all, the  the recommendation 17 doesn't specify what  which of the aggravating 18 factors  19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But this is my 20 hypothetical. 21             MR. WINSOR:  Okay.  So to make sure I 22 understand  23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, a death case, 24 which is not funny. 25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Which honestly sounds the
Alderson Reporting Company

1 same.

Official

41

2             MR. WINSOR:  Well, I think the  I think

3 the difference is, respectfully, is his included the 

4 the finding that the judge finds no evidence to support

5 as opposed to just disagreeing with their  excuse me.

6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And what would happen?

7             MR. WINSOR:  If you had a situation  and,

8 again, this would be limited  let me make sure I'm

9 limiting the  the answer to the situation where the

10 State is depending on the death recommendation of

11 finding an aggravator.

12             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.

13             MR. WINSOR:  Which is the minority of cases,

14 as we  as we said in the brief.  If the jury made a

15 specific finding as to a specific aggravator  and,

16 again, they wouldn't be instructed on that aggravator

17 unless there was sufficient evidence of it at the  at

18 the threshold stage.  But if the judge concluded that

19 there was insufficient evidence  again, he never would

20 have submitted it to the jury  then that  that

21 probably would not be permissible.

22             JUSTICE BREYER:  Go for a second to an

23 analogy.

24             MR. WINSOR:  I'm sorry?

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  There's  there are two

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
42 1 good other analogies in other areas of the law.  The one 2 that supports you is robbery, force or threat of force. 3 No one ever asks or needn't ask whether six members of 4 the jury thought there was a threat but no actual, or 5 seven members thought there was actual but no threat. 6 Threat or threat of force.  I don't think we have to 7 say.  I don't think so.  So that supports you. 8             On the other hand, imagine a normal 9 sentencing case.  The statute says, you  you get 10 aggravated punishment if you had 50 grams of cocaine. 11 The jury finds he had 50 grams of cocaine  no.  Sorry. 12             The statute says aggravated sentence if 13 50 grams of cocaine or meth.  The jury finds he had 14 50 grams of cocaine.  I don't think under Apprendi, 15 which I didn't agree with  but I don't think the judge 16 could say, I'm going to give you the aggravated sentence 17 because I don't believe there was any cocaine, but I do 18 believe there was meth. 19             MR. WINSOR:  That may well be right.  And 20 that's one of the reasons the jury is not asked to find 21 specific aggravating factors. 22             JUSTICE BREYER:  But we do know that the 23 judge here  now still you're having conceded Ring, 24 where the jury says no aggravating factor.  We know that 25 the jury can, if the jury finds aggravating factor X,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
43 1 have death on a completely different aggravating factor, 2 but the jury never thought of, namely why. 3             Now, we know that.  And now compare that to 4 the hypothetical of cocaine and meth.  And then we have 5 Apprendi, which I disagree with still, but... 6             MR. WINSOR:  Well, I think, Your Honor, in 7 the cocaine and meth example, I believe that the  the 8 Court would look, as they did in Jones, to say, well, is 9 the legislature setting this up as distinctive offenses, 10 or are they setting this up as one offense that can be 11 satisfied either by possession of cocaine or meth.  And 12 if it were the latter, then the jury would just be 13 instructed to find one or the other without any  any 14 specific  and we know is that  15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I want to clarify.  You 16 think a seventofive recommendation is finding an 17 element of the crime that makes you eligible for the 18 death penalty by a unanimous or functionally equivalent 19 unanimous jury? 20             MR. WINSOR:  We do, Your Honor.  And let me 21 say  22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, then what do you 23 do with the statement in our case law that says a simple 24 majority is not a unanimous jury? 25             MR. WINSOR:  Well, we don't say that it's a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
44 1 unanimous jury.  Let me step back and say that  that 2 the  the seventofive vote, by the way, is not 3 necessarily five votes that there was no aggravating 4 circumstance, because, again, it's  there's two things 5 that go on in the jury room.  One, they decide whether 6 there were aggravating circumstances.  And, two, they 7 just  they do  8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And they don't agree 9 with which one? 10             MR. WINSOR:  Sorry? 11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So we don't know whether 12 it was premeditation or robbery.  It could be four to 13 three or two to five.  It could be anything. 14             MR. WINSOR:  I'm talking about the jury  15 in the sentencing phase now. 16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right. 17             MR. WINSOR:  So a seven to five could well 18 mean that all 12 jurors found a robbery and all 12 19 jurors found heinous, atrociousness, and cruel  20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We don't know.  What 21 does the seven to five tell us the jury found? 22             MR. WINSOR:  The seven to five tells us that 23 at a minimum, a majority of the jury at a minimum, found 24 beyond a reasonable doubt that the State had proven the 25 existence of one or more aggravating circumstances.  And
Alderson Reporting Company

1 getting back to Justice 

45

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Not the same one?

3             MR. WINSOR:  I'm sorry?

4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Not the same?

5             MR. WINSOR:  Not the same one.

6             And again, getting back to Justice Breyer's

7 point about the cocaine and the meth, the courts in

8 these situations look at what the  what the

9 legislature's  its definitions of the element.  And we

10 know, as a matter of Florida State law, that the element

11 at issue here, to take someone who is not eligible for

12 the death penalty and to make him or her eligible for

13 the death penalty is the existence of one or more

14 aggravating circumstances, not  not a specific one.

15             And so it is like Schad v. Arizona, where

16 you  you can't say whether the jury agreed that there

17 was premeditation or whether there was felony murder.

18 And, in fact, that was the case at this defendant's

19 guilt phase back in 1998.  He was convicted of

20 firstdegree murder.  And the guilt phase jury was

21 instructed that they could return that verdict either by

22 finding premeditation or by finding felony murder.  And

23 there was no jury finding as to which one  which one

24 it was.

25             And so as a matter of  I think to answer

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
46 1 your question about whether they all need to be the same 2 or not, it would depend on what the  how the State 3 legislature  4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you believe that a 5 simple majority is a jury unanimously or functionally 6 unanimously finding that element beyond a reasonable 7 doubt? 8             MR. WINSOR:  Well, we  they're certainly 9 finding it beyond a reasonable doubt.  And we're relying 10 on the Court's decision in Apodaca, but  but also  11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was ten to two. 12             MR. WINSOR:  I'm sorry? 13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does ten to two 14 automatically mean that seven to five is okay? 15             MR. WINSOR:  Not automatically, Your Honor. 16 But I think if you look at Apodaca, what they were 17 rejecting was the same arguments that the petitioner is 18 asking this Court to accept, which is that this long 19 history of the unanimity and the 12person jury 20 necessarily means it's  it's brought in to  to our 21 system. 22             But I'll say this too, the seven to five is 23 not the same kind of jury verdict that you'd have at 24 a  at a guilt phase because of this judicial backstop, 25 because of the other protections that Florida has put in
Alderson Reporting Company

1 in place.

Official

47

2             And so even if it's a seventofive vote,

3 you still have the judge coming behind that jury, who 

4 unlike at the guilt phase where he must accept the

5 jury's findings, unless they're not supported by

6 evidence, he or she can disagree for any reason.  He or

7 she can give mercy for any reason.  And that happens a

8 lot.

9             And so we've cited the  some cases in our

10 brief where a man was convicted of murder in a horrible

11 sexual assault, and by virtue of those two convictions

12 was necessarily eligible for the death penalty.  The

13 jury heard all of the evidence, made a recommendation

14 that he receive the death penalty, and the judge said,

15 no, I'm going to sentence him to life.

16             And so this Court  you know, this gets

17 back into the jury versus judge sentencing.  But there

18 are some real benefits associated with judicial

19 sentences.  And if you go back to Proffitt, when this

20 Court first upheld Florida's capital sentencing system,

21 it recognized the advantages of judicial sentencing

22 because you're not going to have someone's life or death

23 being determined exclusively on the  perhaps the 

24 the emotions of a jury.

25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can  can I go back to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 kinds of hypotheticals that Justice Kennedy and I

48

2 were  were proposing?

3             So let's say that there is a jury, and 

4 and it's been presented with evidence that the murder

5 was for pecuniary gain, which is one of the aggravating

6 factors.  And the  the  the jury comes out with a

7 recommendation of death.  So you  and that was the

8 only thing that was presented to it.  So you know

9 that the  the jury has made a death eligibility

10 determination on pecuniary gain.

11             Then it goes to the judge.  The judge says,

12 you know what, I don't really think that there's enough

13 evidence of pecuniary gain, but I've had this whole

14 hearing, and I find that the thing was  that the crime

15 was heinous and whatnot.  And now I'm going to sentence

16 the person to death.

17             Now, you say that that's fine; is that

18 right?

19             MR. WINSOR:  Well, let me  let me  I

20 realize it's a hypothetical, but let me tell you why

21 that couldn't happen in Florida.  A judge would not

22 instruct a jury on an aggravating circumstance for which

23 there was not sufficient evidence to find that.

24             And so your hypothetical would not happen if

25 there  there was 16 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, you know  no 

49

2 he's  well  he's heard more evidence because, you

3 know, there's a whole new hearing that he has.  And now

4 he's considered it more thoroughly, and he thinks, no, I

5 don't agree with that anymore, but I think it was

6 heinous.  So that would be fine.

7             MR. WINSOR:  Again, that's not this case

8 because there was no additional evidence 

9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, yes, yes, it's not this

10 case.

11             MR. WINSOR:  But  but the  the  the 

12 if the  if the judge found that the  that there was

13 no evidence of any aggravator 

14             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm throwing out 

15             MR. WINSOR:  Okay.

16             JUSTICE KAGAN:   the jury's aggravating

17 factor, but I'm substituting my own.  I thought that

18 that was what you told me that that was constitutional

19 under Ring.

20             MR. WINSOR:  Well, I think it depends on 

21 on why you're throwing it out.  If there  if  if 

22 as with any jury finding, if a judge finds at the guilt

23 phase that there is insufficient evidence to find any

24 element, then  then he would not rely on the  the

25 jury's determination there.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1             JUSTICE KAGAN:  This wasn't at the guilt

50

2 phase; this was just as a matter of sentencing.

3             Let me get on with my questioning 

4             MR. WINSOR:  Yeah.  Sure.

5             JUSTICE KAGAN:   because I think you

6 answered this one already.

7             Then the appeal that's taken, right  the

8 appeal is focusing now only on what the judge has found,

9 isn't that right, under Florida law?  The appeal  if

10 the person came in and said that there was insufficient

11 evidence, the appeal would only be as to the judge's

12 finding and not at all to the jury's.

13             MR. WINSOR:  Well, the  if I understand

14 the hypothetical correctly, someone's convicted, has a

15 death recommendation, a death sentence, and is appealing

16 to the Florida Supreme Court.

17             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And  and he says there was

18 just not enough evidence of all these aggravating

19 factors, so  but that was  would only be as to the

20 judge's aggravating factors.  It couldn't possibly be

21 that he would challenge the jury's.

22             MR. WINSOR:  Well, the judge's aggravating

23 factors would be detailed in a written order.  But if

24 it  if there were  if  if 

25             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, I'm just suggesting

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
51 1 that the whole appeal process suggests that the crucial 2 death eligibility determination is being made by the 3 judge because that's the only death eligibility 4 determination that the appeals court is ever going to 5 review. 6             MR. WINSOR:  Well, I think that's  gets to 7 another benefit of Florida's system, is that  that 8 they  they do have this to review.  You know, there's 9 been some suggestion of jury sentencing as a  10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, look, they have 11 something to review.  The problem is it's the judge's 12 thing to  that they're reviewing, not the jury's, and 13 that's a Sixth Amendment problem. 14             MR. WINSOR:  I don't think it's a 15 Sixth Amendment problem any more than  than here when 16 you.  At the  at the  at the guilt phase when he 17 appealed and there was a  an examination of the 18 evidence and they didn't know whether the jury found on 19 felony murder predicate or on firstdegree murder. 20 They're reviewing the conviction, and they're reviewing 21 the evidence that sustains it. 22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What about  23             MR. WINSOR:  Or they may sustain it. 24             JUSTICE ALITO:  So to what degree is 25 there

2 jury  I'm sorry 

3             JUSTICE ALITO:  So to what degree is there

4 a  a real dispute here about the presence of the two

5 aggravating factors?

6             MR. WINSOR:  There is none, Justice Alito,

7 in my view.  And I know that there was some argument a

8 moment ago about the  about the evidence suggesting

9 that someone else may have committed the crime.  We

10 cited in our brief from their  initial brief in the

11 Florida Supreme Court where they said, "Without any

12 contention, this is a twoaggravator case.  Hurst does

13 not challenge the trial court's findings that the murder

14 was committed during the course of a robbery, and it was

15 especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel."

16             He doesn't question the seriousness of those

17 aggravators either.  His focus instead, acknowledging

18 all that, was on proportionality review, which is not at

19 issue here, but which, by the way, is another benefit of

20 the Florida system, that the Florida Supreme Court

21 reviews everything for  for proportionality.

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I ask you two

23 separate questions on this?

24             MR. WINSOR:  Yes.

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Number one, whenever

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
53 1 have we said that a jury waiver on an issue is based on 2 the lack of a challenge by a defense attorney?  Don't we 3 require waivers of jury trials to be explicit and by the 4 defendant him or herself? 5             MR. WINSOR:  When someone's waiving the jury 6 trial altogether, absolutely.  And, of course, that 7 would be structural error even if there were no 8 objection.  But this is  this is  goes to more like 9 the  the element of offense.  And the Court held in 10 Washington v. Recuenco that the Apprendi error is 11 subject to harmless error here. 12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So where have we ever 13 said that not challenging something is an admission of 14 that something? 15             MR. WINSOR:  Well  16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We take plenty of 17 appeals where people are saying, assuming the state of 18 facts, I'm entitled to X.  And then when they go back 19 down, they argue that that goes  that assumption is 20 wrong.  Why isn't this the same? 21             MR. WINSOR:  Well, we  we cited other 22 portions of the  where they had  excuse me  23 acknowledged that below back in the sentencing 24 memorandum of the first goaround. 25             But to follow up on your question,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
54 1 Justice Alito, about whether there is an existence of 2 a  of a doubt, the Florida Supreme Court found that 3 both of these clearly existed at the postconviction 4 opinion, which led to the resentencing that's now on 5 appeal here.  They sent it back for resentencing not 6 because of anything having to do with death eligibility 7 or the establishment of aggravators.  They sent it back 8 because there was insufficient effort to produce 9 mitigating  10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Has there ever been an 11 appeal in Florida where an advisory jury was given  12 not given a proper instruction and a resentence was  13 was ordered for that reason? 14             MR. WINSOR:  Has there been a Florida 15 Supreme Court reversing a death sentence for  16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  An improper instruction 17 to the advisory jury. 18             MR. WINSOR:  I'd be surprised if there 19 weren't, Your Honor, but I  I don't know.  I  20 I'll  I'll  I'll look at that. 21             Getting back to the  to the admission, the 22 evidence was clear.  There is no question that there was 23 a robbery here.  There is no question that there was  24 that this was heinous, atrocious, and cruel.

3             Mr. Waxman, six minutes.

4            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

5               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6             MR. WAXMAN:  Notwithstanding this flurry of

7 papers, I'm aspiring not to use the six minutes.

8             Let me first  let me go right to

9 Justice Scalia's question, which is not a hypothetical,

10 although I'm happy to answer hypotheticals.

11             Your question was:  Was the jury told and

12 doesn't a jury have to be told that as to death

13 eligibility, the element of the crime of capital murder,

14 that it makes the decision?

15             The answer is:  It does have to be told

16 that.  It certainly can't be told the opposite, and it

17 absolutely was not told that.

18             It was told over and over again, consistent

19 with the statute, that its decision was purely advisory.

20 And I want to refer the Court to the Florida Supreme

21 Court's decision in State v. Steele, which is at 921 So.

22 The Florida Supreme Court in Steele said, first of all,

23 "Nothing in the statute, the standard jury instructions,

24 or the standard verdict form requires a majority of the

25 jury to agree on which aggravating circumstances exist.

56 1 Under current law, the jury may recommend a sentence of 2 death where four jurors believe only that one aggravator 3 applies, while three others believe that only another 4 aggravator applies, because seven jurors believe that at 5 least one aggravator applies." 6             Florida goes beyond that.  It  it is 7 unlawful  and the Supreme Court of Florida has said  8 to require  to ask the jury, the sentencing jury, to 9 provide a special verdict that in any way indicates what 10 their, quote, input is on the sentencing factors. 11             Again, Steele, at page 546.  "Specific jury 12 findings on aggravators, without guidance about their 13 effect on the imposition of a sentence, could unduly 14 influence the trial judge's own determination of how to 15 sentence the defendant.  The trial court alone must make 16 detailed findings about the existence and weight of 17 aggravating circumstances." 18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that a  post Ring? 19 What's the date of that? 20             MR. WAXMAN:  Yes, this is post Ring.  And 21 the Court also held that Ring didn't apply. 22             It has no jury findings on which to rely. 23             And, in fact, the Court also explained in  24 later in the decision  in the same decision and also 25 in its decision in Franklin, that Florida bar  quote,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 "Florida bars a special verdict precisely because

57

2 requiring specific jury findings on aggravators, without

3 guidance about their effect, would harm the jury's

4 independent"  "the trial court's independent

5 determination."

6             Now, counsel  my  my colleague on the

7 other side here says that, well, there  there would

8 not be a statutory problem, but there would be a Ring

9 problem if we knew that the jury found that no

10 aggravators existed.  So how can Ring be satisfied when

11 we have no earthly idea what the jury found?  It could

12 be, as in this case, as Steele acknowledges, three for

13 one and four for the other.

14             As to the, I think, hypothetical question

15 that Justice Kagan was asking  so, you know, in a

16 circumstance, how much leeway does the judge have to

17 make his own  his or her own decisions on the death

18 penalty, the Florida Supreme Court has specifically

19 allowed the death penalty to be imposed and a

20 determination of death eligibility to be made based on

21 evidence that was never presented to the sentencing jury

22 and based on an aggravating factor on which the

23 sentencing jury was not applied.

24             And the notion that there hasn't been a

25 lifeoverride since Ring is  is an interesting fact,

Alderson Reporting Company

58 1 but this Court, in this Court's Sposiano decision, in 2 this Court's Daubert decision, that's exactly what 3 happened:  The jury said, we want life.  The judge said, 4 I'm hearing  I'm hearing independent evidence, and 5 you're getting death. 6             Now, as to the supposed concessions in this 7 case, I think I'll rely largely on our brief.  But the 8 notion that somebody  that the lawyers said this is a 9 twoaggravator case is certainly true.  There were two 10 aggravators charged.  And maybe the jury  we know that 11 the trial judge found that two aggravators were 12 satisfied. 13             This defendant has been making the Ring 14 argument since before Ring was decided.  He raised this 15 as an Apprendi issue at the very first trial.  He asked 16 for a bill of particulars for the  the State to 17 indicate which aggravators it was going to rely on, and 18 he was denied on the grounds that Apprendi doesn't 19 apply. 20             Even the  again, the central Ring problem 21 in this case, the central Sixth Amendment problem in 22 this case, leaving aside the indeterminacy of seven to 23 five  and maybe it's three for one and four for the 24 other  is that, when a Florida sentencing jury 25 finishes its work, there is simply no question:  The

59 1 defendant is not eligible for the death penalty.  Only 2 the trial judge can do that. 3             Thank you. 4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 5             The case is submitted. 6             (Whereupon, at 12:20 p.m., the case in the
