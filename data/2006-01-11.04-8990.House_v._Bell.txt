3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

4 next in House v. Bell.

5 Mr. Kissinger.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. KISSINGER

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8 MR. KISSINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, may it

9 please the Court:

10 The jurors which --

11 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why don't you raise the

12 level of the podium a little so we can hear you?

13 MR. KISSINGER: Is that better, Your Honor?

14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Not much.

15 MR. KISSINGER: One more sound check. Does

16 that --

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.

18 MR. KISSINGER: Thank you.

19 The jurors who convicted Mr. House of first

20 degree murder heard that semen stains on the victim's

21 clothing matched Mr. House. They didn't hear the DNA

22 evidence which showed that not to be the case.

23 The jurors heard --

24 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was that because there was

25 no such analysis at the time?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice

2 O'Connor.

3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: How many years ago was

4 this trial?

5 MR. KISSINGER: The trial, Your Honor, was

6 approximately 20 years ago.

7 The jurors who convicted Mr. House heard that

8 bloodstains on Mr. House's blue jeans matched the blood

9 belonging to the victim. They didn't hear the

10 assistant chief medical examiner for the State of

11 Tennessee testify that the source of those bloodstains

12 was a sample taken during Ms. Muncey's autopsy, nor did

13 they hear --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: The district court heard

15 that, though, didn't it?

16 MR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice

17 Scalia.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: And didn't believe it.

19 Right? And did not believe it. Found as a matter of

20 fact that the blood was -- was not a result of the

21 spill.

22 MR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia, the court

23 made a conclusion that the blood which had spilt from

24 the tube had spilt after -- after the blood had been

25 tested. It did not, however, make a factual finding.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 It made a conclusion of law regarding that, Your Honor.

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- is that a conclusion

3 of law?

4 MR. KISSINGER: It is, Your Honor. If the

5 Court were to look at the district court order, the

6 district court order was divided into two distinct

7 parts. The first part --

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care what part it

9 put it in. The district court did not believe that the

10 blood on the trousers was a consequence of the spill

11 and that -- and that, therefore, blood was identified

12 on the inside of his trousers that was the blood of the

13 victim. That's what the district court believed,

14 having heard the testimony.

15 MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, what the district

16 -- what the district court concluded as a matter of law

17 was that it -- that notwithstanding Dr. Blake's

18 testimony regarding the source of the blood found on

19 Mr. House's jeans, that that did not eliminate the --

20 eliminate the testimony of Agent Scott who said that he

21 saw blood on the jeans when he first -- excuse me. Let

22 me rephrase that because it's actually a critical

23 matter. He saw what he thought appeared to be

24 bloodstains on the jeans when he first picked them up.

25 What the district court did in that instance

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 was exactly the error that Mr. House has brought to the

2 attention of this Court, which is in the face of

3 evidence of innocence, the district court, simply

4 because it found some contrary evidence in the record,

5 found that Mr. House had failed to make his showing.

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: On that point -- on that one

7 point, do you contend that the district court was

8 clearly erroneous?

9 MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: On that one point of the

11 blood, of whether, indeed, his blood was on -- or the

12 victim's blood was on the inside of his trousers? On

13 that one point, do you claim that the district court

14 was clearly erroneous?

15 MR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia, we actually

16 make two claims regarding that. First, that that was a

17 conclusion of law entitled to -- entitled to de novo

18 review. Second, that --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's your -- what's your

20 second point? Because I --

21 MR. KISSINGER: Second, Justice Scalia, if

22 indeed it was a finding of fact, yes, that finding of

23 fact was clearly erroneous.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: On the basis solely of the

25 testimony of -- of this expert.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, on the basis of

2 the entirety of the record, which is what this Court

3 instructed the district court to examine when it

4 conducts a Schlup inquiry.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Including the contrary

6 testimony that said if it had been the result of a

7 spill, it would not have been splattered all over, as

8 it was here. Some of it wouldn't have been on the

9 inside of the trousers. Some of it wouldn't have been

10 mixed with mud. Despite all of that, you -- you can

11 say that the district court's finding, which I consider

12 a finding of fact, was clearly erroneous.

13 MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, including not

14 only that testimony, but the testimony of the same

15 expert who made the statements which the Court just

16 cited, who said that she was unable -- that she was

17 excluding merely the direct spillage, the pouring of

18 blood onto the jeans, and conceded in her testimony

19 that the transfer stains which she observed, the type

20 of stains which she observed could, in fact, have been

21 -- that she had no opinion as to the cause of those,

22 only that it was the result of one object wiping

23 against another object.

24 Also, in light of the testimony in regarding --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I -- I agree

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that all of this stuff would -- would have made a

2 better case for the defendant here. But once the case

3 has been tried and both sides have put on all the

4 evidence they have, we have a -- a much different test,

5 and -- and that is whether any reasonable juror could

6 have found him guilty. That's a very heavy burden:

7 whether any reasonable jury could have found guilt. I

8 agree it would have been a much closer case, but -- but

9 the burden you -- you have before us here is to

10 establish that no reasonable jury could possibly have

11 found him guilty.

12 MR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia --

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: And on -- just on the blood

14 thing alone, I -- I find that a hard burden to bear.

15 MR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia, there --

16 there are two things which come into the -- into the

17 Court's analysis.

18 First is the Court is correct. The burden is

19 quite high, and it's -- it's high for a reason. It's

20 justifiably high. We don't shrink from that burden,

21 Your Honor.

22 What we say is that along with that burden,

23 the Court also requires that the entirety of the

24 evidence be reviewed. If the entirety of the evidence

25 is reviewed and the effect of the entirety of the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 evidence on a properly instructed, reasonable juror --

2 that's the nature of the -- the determination -- what

3 effect will that have? When we look at the facts in

4 this case, when we look at the blood evidence in this

5 case, yes, we don't deny that there is evidence which

6 could support conviction. However, that is not the

7 test in Schlup. Schlup specifically rejected that

8 inquiry.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: What did it rest on? What

10 -- what is the district court's conclusion? The court

11 concludes that the spillage occurred after the FBI

12 crime lab received and tested the evidence. What does

13 that rest on?

14 MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, quite frankly, we

15 can't determine that -- that statement rests on

16 anything. The undisputed evidence in the record

17 consists of a photograph of the blood samples at the

18 time they were received by the defense expert. The box

19 was opened. A photograph was taken. The photograph

20 shows clearly that one entire tube of blood is missing

21 and the second tube of blood has leaked within the

22 packaging.

23 But the record also contains the testimony of

24 the TBI agent who transported the blood from the FBI to

25 the defense expert who said he observed no blood that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 leaked other than the -- other than what was inside the

2 container.

3 It also contains the testimony of the FBI

4 agent who tested the blood at the FBI who said two

5 things. One, I used no -- no more than one quarter of

6 a tube of blood and that no blood spilt while the tube

7 was in the possession of the FBI.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it also contained the

9 testimony of an expert who said that if the tube

10 spilled in that way, it would not have created the kind

11 of spatterings that -- that were incriminating in this

12 case. Even if there was some spill, it would not have

13 produced the kind of spattering. So, you know, I call

14 that a draw.

15 MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, two -- two things

16 to -- two things to point out there. First is that

17 that eliminates only one possible hypothesis and that

18 is the hypothesis that blood was directly spilt onto --

19 onto the -- onto the jeans. I think the example that

20 the expert gave was these are not stains, for example,

21 the pouring of a -- like coffee -- pouring coffee onto

22 the lap of your jeans or something like that. These

23 are simply transfers: one bloody object wiped against

24 another.

25 So while she gave a hypothesis of guilt --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 and again, Your Honor, it comes to the could and would

2 distinction. Yes, it -- that could be considered

3 evidence of guilt, what would a -- but, however, that's

4 not the inquiry. The inquiry is what would a

5 reasonable juror who heard that on one side, that it

6 didn't spill directly, but on the other side, heard the

7 evidence that we began -- that I began to discuss with

8 Justice Breyer, which is the evidence of the TBI agent,

9 the photographic evidence, the evidence of the FBI

10 agent, the evidence that the Styrofoam box was opened

11 during transit to the FBI and that objects were removed

12 from it during transit.

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have two questions on the

14 blood, and there's a lot you want to cover here, so I

15 won't take too much of your time.

16 One, is it significant for your case that

17 this was a very small sample?

18 Two, was the evidence about the enzymatic

19 degradation -- was that available? Was the science

20 about that fully available to the defense at the time

21 of trial?

22 I had those two questions.

23 MR. KISSINGER: Justice Kennedy, in terms of

24 the -- the size of -- of the bloodstains, it was

25 significant to the extent that it bears upon the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 probative value of the testimony of Charles Scott when

2 he says -- when he said he saw what he thought might be

3 stains. As a simple matter of fact, this -- the jeans

4 were stained with a number of substances, not just

5 blood, and a number of witnesses, including the trial

6 prosecutor himself, described the bloodstains as

7 actually so small that they were difficult to detect by

8 the human eye.

9 The second part of your question, Justice

10 Kennedy, yes. That evidence was available. And our

11 position is that it -- that goes actually to the

12 substance of our constitutional ineffective assistance

13 of counsel claim. Trial counsel had in his possession

14 -- or his expert certainly had in his possession the

15 photograph that showed an entire tube of blood missing.

16 Therefore, he had evidence that there was something

17 wrong with the blood. Trial counsel was actually

18 concerned about this blood. He filed a pretrial motion

19 to suppress this blood evidence. Here's trial counsel

20 with evidence that blood is missing. He knows it's a

21 critical issue in the case and he failed to go out and

22 hire someone like the assistant chief medical examiner

23 for the State of Tennessee who came into Federal court

24 and testified as to the -- that the source of this

25 blood was, in fact, that empty tube.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that would be an

2 important point if, in fact, it conclusively

3 established that the blood was not the blood of the

4 victim, but I don't think it does conclusively

5 establish that, and if it doesn't, the -- the less than

6 perfect performance of counsel is -- is no basis for

7 setting aside the conviction.

8 MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, two matters on

9 that. Again, the proof of innocence does not have to

10 be absolute. This Court stated in Schlup that the fact

11 that there is still some evidence of guilt or that

12 there still exists even substantial evidence of guilt

13 does not prevent a defendant from passing through the

14 Schlup gateway.

15 The second matter and one which I think is

16 important is that as a matter of Tennessee law, a

17 circumstantial evidence case requires not only that the

18 prosecution prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt,

19 but that it eliminate all reasonable hypotheses of

20 innocence. So even if a jury could conclude that the

21 blood came during -- that the blood got on the jeans

22 during the course of the crime, it would also have to

23 be able -- it would also have to be probable that the

24 same jury would also conclude that it was an

25 impossibility for Mr. Blake -- Dr. Blake's testimony to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 be correct. So, in fact, it's Dr. Blake's testimony

2 which has to be impossible to -- to accept in order for

3 a jury to find --

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: At one point--

5 MR. KISSINGER: -- a reasonable juror to find

6 --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Scalia said blood

8 of the victim. You don't contest that this was the

9 blood of the victim. The question is at what point did

10 it get transferred to the jeans.

11 MR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice

12 Ginsburg.

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's no question about

14 it being someone else's blood.

15 MR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice

16 Ginsburg. The question has been, from the beginning of

17 this case, when the blood came to get on Mr. House's

18 jeans.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. And -- and the point

20 of controversy is whether a spill of -- of the -- of

21 the blood in -- in the course of transport could have

22 produced this -- this kind of -- of spattering,

23 including a spattering on the inside of -- of the

24 trousers near the button. It -- it seems to me

25 unlikely, and -- and I am unable to say that no

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 reasonable jury -- juror could not think it unlikely.

2 MR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia, I -- I would

3 disagree with -- with the Court's analysis there. I --

4 I think what -- what the issue here is more whether,

5 given the testimony of Dr. Blake, given the

6 corroborating evidence that supports Dr. Blake's

7 testimony, would a reasonable juror have doubts or

8 would any reasonable juror have a -- retain a

9 reasonable -- excuse me --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's much more than that.

11 MR. KISSINGER: Let me rephrase that, Justice

12 Scalia. The question is, given the Tennessee jury

13 instruction --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Any reasonable juror would

15 have had to have a reasonable doubt.

16 MR. KISSINGER: Yes, thank you, Justice

17 Breyer.

18 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And you're

19 saying yes, any reasonable juror would have had to have

20 a reasonable doubt irrespective of what the trial judge

21 found.

22 MR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice

23 Breyer.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the -- so the --

25 we would have to be finding in this case, if we ruled

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in your favor, that we think the trial judge is

2 unreasonable.

3 MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, that's actually

4 not correct either. Schlup specifically says that the

5 function of the district judge in a Schlup hearing is

6 not to make an independent judgment on the evidence in

7 front of him, but to make a probabilistic determination

8 of the effect of the evidence on a reasonable juror.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, but surely he's supposed

10 to make factual determinations. We -- I -- I don't

11 want to make factual determinations on all these

12 questions. That's -- that's not our system of law.

13 Those factual determinations are made by the trial

14 judge. And here, I agree with you that we don't have

15 to accept his judgment as to what a reasonable juror

16 would have done, but I do think that we have to accept

17 his factual findings as accurate unless they're clearly

18 erroneous. And here, he made the factual finding that

19 that blood was there before the transport. And I -- I

20 think I'm bound by that unless you can show that it is

21 clearly erroneous, which I don't think you can.

22 MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, first, we -- we

23 believe we have -- have shown that it's clearly

24 erroneous.

25 Second, even viewing the blood evidence

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 separately, even saying, well, Mr. House has put up

2 some evidence of -- some evidence of innocence

3 regarding this blood evidence, but not enough to really

4 sway me regarding that, that evidence itself has to be

5 viewed in light of the entire record. And in light of

6 the entire record, that blood evidence, standing alone

7 in its even somewhat compromised state, no reasonable

8 juror would be able to come to the conclusion that Mr.

9 House was guilty because the remaining evidence of his

10 innocence is also very substantial.

11 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are you going to mention

12 any of the other, or are we going to just deal with the

13 blood today?

14 MR. KISSINGER: Justice O'Connor, we -- we

15 would like to move on to -- to some of the other

16 evidence because it -- it is substantial. And we've

17 set -- we've set out a lot of that evidence beginning

18 at page 6 of our reply brief.

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Will you also cover,

20 because your time is short, if you get through the

21 gateway on your actual innocence contention, what are

22 your constitutional claims that lie behind it? Because

23 I don't think much was said about that in the briefing.

24 What is it that you would -- you would say if you got

25 through the gate?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KISSINGER: Justice Ginsburg, as -- as I

2 mentioned earlier, we believe that we have numerous

3 instances of ineffective assistance of counsel. First,

4 counsel's failure to -- upon knowing of the importance

5 of the blood evidence, which he clearly did because he

6 raised -- raised the issue himself, upon knowing of the

7 photograph showing the missing blood, he failed to go

8 forward and basically do what we did in Federal court,

9 which was hire an expert to look at the results of the

10 FBI testing and to determine whether there was a viable

11 defense -- a viable defense strategy available there,

12 which he did not.

13 Also, if we look at the record in this case,

14 we have a situation where trial counsel also pointed

15 toward Hubert Muncey, Jr. as the actual perpetrator of

16 this crime. He actually called the sister of the

17 victim to say that his sister was afraid of Mr. Muncey

18 and that she had plans to leave him. When we look at

19 what was available to trial counsel there, we see five

20 witnesses, many of whom were friends of Mr. Muncey, who

21 presented evidence that showed that on the night of Ms.

22 Muncey's murder, Mr. Muncey and Ms. Muncey had a fight

23 at the C&C Recreation Center, that Ms. Muncey went

24 home, that Mr. Muncey followed her there, that he

25 confessed that when he returned home, he was angry and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 drunk, that they began to argue again, that he struck

2 her in the head, that she fell, that he checked her

3 lifeless body and found she was dead, and that he hid

4 her body in the bushes.

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but the -- the

6 injuries on the body are simply not consonant with --

7 with that manner of her -- of her death. A police

8 officer testified not only to a head injury, but to

9 blood coming out of the nose and ears, scratches and

10 bruises on her throat and legs, scratches on her face.

11 That simply is not consonant with one whack on the

12 head.

13 MR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia, there --

14 there are two issues there. In fact, the -- the

15 pathologist's testimony and -- and the law enforcement

16 officer's testimony is consistent to the extent that

17 the injuries which Mr. Muncey described inflicting

18 were, in fact, inflicted upon the victim. There were

19 those injuries. The point -- the fact that there were

20 additional injuries to the victims -- to the victim

21 assumes that somehow Mr. Muncey's independent, short

22 confession, because, remember, when he started to

23 confess -- after he makes this confession, he's rushed

24 out of the home and told that they don't want to hear

25 anything. This isn't a situation like a law

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 enforcement -- a confession made to law enforcement

2 where once obtaining evidence of guilt, law enforcement

3 pursues and tries to get as many of the details out of

4 it. I don't believe that it would be -- it's

5 significant or it would be significant to any

6 reasonable juror that Mr. Muncey did not describe every

7 single injury that he inflicted on Ms. Muncey that

8 night.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: You've mentioned -- in

10 response to Justice Ginsburg, you didn't mention -- and

11 perhaps it was inadvertent. If not, I want to know why

12 not. I thought if you get through the gate, what

13 you're going to say is the State should have given us

14 evidence that they had that showed that Mr. Muncey had

15 sexual relations with his wife the morning of the

16 killing, and therefore, the semen that they found

17 didn't necessarily belong to your client, but rather

18 belonged to him. As it turned out, it didn't.

19 MR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice

20 Breyer.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: So you're going to make that

22 Brady claim.

23 MR. KISSINGER: We -- we are going to also

24 make the Brady claim. In addition, Your Honor, if

25 indeed that evidence was available to trial counsel,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 who did talk to Mr. Muncey, who was able to interview

2 Mr. Muncey, and failed to ask Mr. Muncey whether he had

3 had sexual relationships with his wife, even though

4 trial counsel attempted ineffectively at trial to -- to

5 show that -- that that semen belonged to Mr. Muncey.

6 So it's one of those situations, Justice Breyer, where

7 there is either Brady for the State's failure to turn

8 it over, or if it was available, it's another instance

9 of ineffective assistance of counsel.

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, could I step

11 -- step back a little bit to get -- to get back to the

12 standard of review? Because I think it's an unusual

13 one. You started out by talking about what the first

14 jury knew and didn't know, but we are in no sense

15 reviewing that jury determination. Correct?

16 MR. KISSINGER: That is correct, Justice

17 Roberts.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We are supposed to

19 look at all of the evidence, the new evidence and the

20 old evidence, and determine simply whether or not it

21 would be unreasonable for any juror to vote to convict

22 on the basis of all of that evidence. Is that right?

23 MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, what Schlup says

24 is that we are to step back and see whether it is more

25 likely than not that no -- that any reasonable juror

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 would vote to convict.

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Any reasonable juror would

3 have to have a reasonable doubt.

4 MR. KISSINGER: Would have -- would have --

5 that's correct, Justice Breyer.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, in other words,

7 no reasonable juror -- no -- no juror could reasonably

8 vote to convict. In other words, if we look at this

9 evidence and think that -- and again, we're not

10 reviewing the prior jury's evidence. If we look at

11 this and say, maybe a jury would come out 10 to 2 in

12 favor of acquittal, if we think that would be

13 reasonable, then you lose. Right?

14 MR. KISSINGER: Chief Justice Roberts, I --

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under my hypothetical

16 there are two reasonable jurors who vote to convict.

17 MR. KISSINGER: Chief Justice Roberts, the

18 danger in that hypothetical is that we are approaching

19 an area where the definition of the reasonable juror

20 becomes something subjective. The definition of a

21 reasonable juror is not a subjective inquiry. In fact,

22 it's a -- it's an objective inquiry. So to that

23 extent, I would have to disagree with -- with your

24 analysis or your -- or your hypothetical, which is that

25 maybe there might be two jurors out there who would

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 listen to this evidence and vote to convict Mr. House.

2 I don't think that's a correct statement --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, Schlup shouldn't --

4 shouldn't have expressed it that way then. Schlup must

5 have -- must have made a big mistake when it said no

6 reasonable juror could. It should have expressed it

7 differently and said a reasonable juror would not --

8 would not have found, but they didn't say that. It

9 said no reasonable juror.

10 MR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, I believe the

11 Court in -- I believe the Court in Schlup took the word

12 reasonable to encompass the point which I have just

13 made.

14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, didn't -- you -- you

15 have accepted Justice Scalia's formulation, but my

16 understanding is that Schlup did not say no reasonable

17 juror could. Schlup said no reasonable juror would

18 have. Isn't that correct?

19 MR. KISSINGER: And that's correct, Justice

20 Souter.

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I mean, it's would, not

22 could.

23 MR. KISSINGER: It -- it is would.

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Could would imply a

25 sufficiency of evidence possibility of analyzing it,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 but the would language excludes a sufficiency of

2 evidence. The -- the would formulation says, in

3 effect, what would the reasonable juror actually have

4 done. Is that your understanding? I mean, is that

5 your point?

6 MR. KISSINGER: That is, Justice Souter.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or more precisely, what

8 would all reasonable jurors have done.

9 MR. KISSINGER: What would any reasonable

10 juror, Justice Scalia.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: All reasonable jurors.

12 MR. KISSINGER: I believe the language is

13 any.

14 Well, if there are no more questions, I'd

15 like to reserve the remainder of my time.

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

17 Kissinger.

18 Ms. Smith, we'll hear now from you.

19 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER SMITH

20 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21 MS. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

22 please the Court:

23 The evidence presented in the district court

24 fails to raise sufficient doubt about Mr. House's guilt

25 to justify review of his procedurally defaulted claims

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 because reasonable jurors would not ignore the fact

2 that Mr. House's jeans were stained with the blood of

3 Carolyn Muncey. That is a fact that has not been

4 undermined by any of the evidence presented in the

5 Federal habeas proceeding.

6 The enzymatic degradation theory of Dr. Blake

7 was so thoroughly discredited in the Federal

8 evidentiary hearing that it is highly unlikely that any

9 reasonable juror, viewing all the evidence, would be

10 convinced by it, let alone that everyone would vote to

11 acquit in light of it. In fact, the petitioner's

12 evidence of innocence was disputed in nearly every

13 respect and sorely --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: How was -- how was that? I

15 thought you'd go on to say how that -- how was it? I

16 -- I read that Dr. Blake said this. He said, look, I

17 -- there -- there are tiny little specks of blood on

18 the jeans and we test them. They were tested. And

19 they show that a certain enzyme deteriorated to degree

20 X, and that's true of the test tube blood as well.

21 Both deteriorated to degree X. But if you take fresh

22 blood and splatter it, there will be no deterioration.

23 So conclusion: the blood on the jeans came from the

24 test tube. Now, you say that was discredited, but I

25 didn't read anywhere anything that discredited it.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 What was the discrediting of that?

2 MS. SMITH: That was specifically discredited

3 by the -- by the testimony of Agent Bigbee.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Who said?

5 MS. SMITH: Dr. Blake's specific opinion was

6 that his interpretation of the enzyme marker study,

7 specifically the GLO1 enzyme on the jeans and on the

8 vial --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: Right.

10 MS. SMITH: -- showed inc -- inc --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

12 MS. SMITH: -- which he took to mean

13 incomplete penetrance.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

15 MS. SMITH: Agent Bigbee specifically

16 disputed not only the literal interpretation of that,

17 in that it doesn't mean incomplete penetrance. In

18 fact, Agent Bigbee did not know what that even meant in

19 the area of serology, but he -- he disagreed with the

20 meaning that Dr. Blake ascribed to that -- to that

21 definition -- to that notation.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: Which meant what?

23 MS. SMITH: Which Dr. Blake concluded that --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: Was incomplete, and what did

25 the FBI man say it was?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. SMITH: Agent Bigbee testified -- or Dr.

2 Blake testified that the inc meant that the enzyme was

3 not present, that it had dropped out.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: He -- he says it meant

5 incomplete. And what do you -- what did -- what did

6 Dr. Bigbee say it --

7 MS. SMITH: Dr. Blake said it was not

8 present. It had dropped out. Agent --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: Now -- I -- Dr. Blake, you

10 just said, said that the word inc meant incomplete.

11 MS. SMITH: That's correct.

12 JUSTICE BREYER: And you say Dr. Bigbee

13 discredited that by saying, no, it didn't mean that.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's Agent Bigbee. I'm

15 getting confused.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: It meant something else.

17 What is the something else?

18 MS. SMITH: Agent Bigbee testified that inc

19 means --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: Means.

21 MS. SMITH: -- inconclusive --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Now, all right --

23 MS. SMITH: -- which means that the enzyme is

24 present --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine, okay.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. SMITH: -- but that he could not subtype

2 it.

3 JUSTICE BREYER: They don't know how much.

4 Now, I have on page 119, which they cite, of

5 the transcript Mr. Pruden is talking to Mr. -- Dr.

6 Blake. Would your opinion change, doctor, if the,

7 quote, inc notation meant inconclusive rather than

8 incomplete penetration? Answer: same difference.

9 Question: so your opinion would not change? Answer:

10 that is correct.

11 MS. SMITH: But the -- the dispute goes

12 beyond the literal interpretation of the inc. It goes

13 to the meaning ascribed to it. And Agent Bigbee

14 disagreed that Dr. Blake -- with Dr. Blake's conclusion

15 that the inc indicated that the enzyme had dropped out

16 of the sample. He said it was present. It could not

17 be typed.

18 Agent Bigbee also disagreed with Dr. Blake's

19 overarching theory that there was equal deterioration

20 in the vials -- in the blood in the vials and the

21 blood on the pants. In fact, Agent Bigbee went through

22 step by step --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: But it would have been the

24 easiest thing in the world for you if, in fact, you

25 think that this is not true that enzyme GL706BX,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 contrary to what Dr. Blake said, had not deteriorated

2 in the blood spot, do a test. Find out if it's

3 deteriorated or not. Can't -- can't that be done?

4 I mean, Dr. Blake in this part is reading his

5 own report. His own report says the enzyme

6 deteriorated in the spots on the jeans, and I see

7 nothing here that says to the contrary. But if that

8 weren't true, the blood is right there, and if it

9 weren't true that it had deteriorated, I would have

10 expected testimony, at the least, saying no, Dr. Blake,

11 you are wrong.

12 MS. SMITH: Your Honor, that --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: The blood did not

14 deteriorate. The enzyme did not deteriorate. But

15 there is no such testimony. Instead, you seem to be

16 relying on the difference between the word incomplete

17 and inconclusive, a difference that Dr. Blake says is

18 inconclusive or incomplete.

19 MS. SMITH: Dr. Blake was not reading his own

20 report. Dr. Blake performed no independent analysis.

21 Dr. Blake was reading Agent Bigbee's report. Agent

22 Bigbee was explaining to the district court the meaning

23 of the notations that he included in his report.

24 But the -- but the dispute goes beyond just

25 experts.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So Bigbee -- Bigbee

2 was explaining what he meant when he wrote inc.

3 MS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it was different

5 than what Dr. Blake said it meant.

6 MS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor. The

7 report at issue was a report prepared pretrial by Agent

8 Bigbee when he did the -- the initial enzyme analysis.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: The district court heard all

10 of this, didn't it, all this evidence, and -- and

11 didn't the district court make a factual finding?

12 MS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor. Not

13 only did the district court note --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, we -- we can call in

15 these witnesses ourselves, I suppose, and hear them all

16 again, but we usually accept the factual findings of

17 the trier of fact.

18 MS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor. And

19 the district court specifically found as a fact that

20 the blood spill --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: But does that finding rest

22 on the conclusion that Dr. Blake was not credible and

23 Agent Bigbee was credible?

24 MS. SMITH: I think that that conclusion

25 implicitly includes a finding that Agent Bigbee was --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 was credible and Dr. Blake was not credible.

2 JUSTICE STEVENS: And that Dr. Blake was not

3 credible.

4 MS. SMITH: There were additional --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: And who -- what was Dr.

6 Blake's background?

7 MS. SMITH: Dr. Blake's background is -- is

8 that he was a forensic pathologist.

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Employed often by the

10 State?

11 MS. SMITH: He was often employed by the

12 State. He had a history of -- of being employed by the

13 State. At this time, he was not a State agent, Your

14 Honor. He was not -- had not worked in any way, shape,

15 or form on this case. He did not perform the autopsy.

16 He did not view the body. He did not perform the

17 enzyme marker study in this case. He simply came in

18 and reviewed results and photographs that had been

19 conducted and taken by -- by individuals previously.

20 He had no direct responsibility in this case aside from

21 --

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: So you're -- you're

23 basically arguing he was not a credible witness.

24 MS. SMITH: He was not a credible witness,

25 Your Honor.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what is the answer

2 to my question? Because I do think it turns on this.

3 A lot does. The trial judge sat there and said this is

4 very important. Dr. Blake is quoting from something

5 called part 5, which I thought was his report. And

6 then the trial judge says, where did you get that idea?

7 Where did you get that idea, that the -- that the

8 enzyme wasn't there in -- in the jeans' blood? Where

9 did you get it? And he says I got it from the FBI

10 report, I think. He's not certain because he's

11 remembering his own conclusion. He isn't quite sure

12 where he got it from.

13 And now it turns out that the inc when they

14 -- it said inc, which he thought meant there isn't much

15 enzyme there. And then they say, well, maybe it meant

16 inconclusive. And he says, that wouldn't matter because

17 I guess I took it to mean that too would show there

18 wasn't much enzyme there. Both would come to the same

19 thing.

20 And now, if I'm sitting there and thinking,

21 I'm thinking, well, either there is or there isn't this

22 enzyme in the -- in the blood that's right there.

23 Easiest thing in the world to prove. And if somebody

24 is going to dispute it, the State will come back and

25 say, no, no, the enzyme is there. But they didn't.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 So I read the testimony and I read the fact

2 that you didn't dispute it with any evidence that's

3 saying, yes, the enzyme is not there.

4 MS. SMITH: Your Honor, Agent Bigbee

5 specifically testified that the enzyme was there.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: He did? Where is that?

7 MS. SMITH: He specifically testified on page

8 282 of the joint appendix. He specifically said, that

9 doesn't mean it wasn't present. He also pointed out

10 GLO should have been present --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: Let's --

12 MS. SMITH: -- and said it wasn't.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't mean it isn't

14 present isn't quite the same thing, is it?

15 MS. SMITH: Agent Bigbee specifically

16 testified that the enzyme was present. It could not be

17 typed to any degree of certainty. So he simply called

18 it inconclusive but that it was present. If it had not

19 been present, he would have marked it N/A, meaning no

20 activity, which was also included in the report in a

21 separate location.

22 But I think it goes beyond --

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Smith, would -- could

24 you focusing on this, what's called a finding, although

25 the district judge himself puts it under conclusions of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 law, just -- the court concludes that the spillage

2 occurred after the FBI crime laboratory received and

3 tested the evidence. What is the basis, the specific

4 basis, for that conclusion, that it occurred after the

5 FBI tested the evidence?

6 MS. SMITH: The specific basis identified

7 explicitly in the opinion was that Special Agent Scott,

8 when he removed the -- the blue jeans from the hamper

9 in Donna Turner's trailer, saw what appeared to be

10 bloodstains on the jeans. That blood ultimately ended

11 up testing as -- as positive for blood and, in fact,

12 Carolyn Muncey's blood so that -- so that the stains

13 were observed when they were removed from the hamper.

14 He also noted that Agent Bigbee testified when he

15 received the blood at the -- the FBI laboratory, there

16 was no evidence of contamination.

17 Agent Bigbee testified to the FBI protocols

18 and said that if there had been any evidence of

19 contamination or spillage, the evidence would have been

20 returned without testing. So he looked specifically at

21 that.

22 He also looked and specifically pointed out a

23 significant -- the testimony of Paulette Sutton, who

24 indicated -- who was the blood spatter expert. She

25 indicated that some of the bloodstains were mixed with

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 mud, and to her that indicated that there had not been

2 some accidental spillage in -- in an evidence

3 container, that the mud and the blood would have --

4 were -- were combined to the extent that they would

5 have had to get on the jeans at or near the same time.

6 So those -- those things --

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but then there was

8 also the evidence that was not disputed, that it was a

9 dry day and that there was no mud at all at the scene

10 of the crime.

11 MS. SMITH: Your Honor, I'm not sure that the

12 evidence is undisputed that it was a dry day. If you

13 look at the autopsy report that's in -- that's in

14 evidence in -- in the trial record, it specifically

15 says that it was drizzling that day, that the

16 temperature was between 80 and 90 degrees and it was

17 drizzling. Mr. House showed up with blood all over his

18 jeans. He got the blood somewhere. I don't -- nothing

19 is -- I don't think it's entirely clear that -- that

20 the conditions were dry. His -- his jeans were clearly

21 muddy --

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that was --

23 MS. SMITH: -- and it showed up.

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that it was agreed that

25 there -- that the site where the body was found, that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that was dry, that that was dry ground. I thought

2 there was no dispute about that.

3 MS. SMITH: I'm not sure that -- that it's

4 clear where Mr. House got the mud on his jeans. He was

5 -- he traveled some distance from the site of the body

6 and -- and to his home. He could have gotten muddy en

7 route. I -- I can't explain how he got the blood on

8 his jeans. I know he showed up with muddy jeans. He

9 got mud on his jeans at some point, and those -- and

10 the mud and the blood were -- were intermingled. I'm

11 not sure that they got on there at the same time.

12 I'm also not sure that the mud that Paulette

13 Sutton saw was -- was created by a combination of mud

14 and water. It could have been perspiration. It could

15 have been any other type of -- of fluid. It could have

16 been blood creating the mud.

17 So it's -- that is -- that's very ambiguous,

18 and -- and I think that the fact -- the significance of

19 the testimony is that it -- it did not indicate an

20 accidental spillage after the fact of the blood onto

21 the jeans. And I think that was -- that was the point

22 that the district court took from that. He wasn't

23 trying to -- to recreate the exact sequence of events

24 in the crime. He was simply trying to pinpoint at what

25 point the blood spilled because there's no question the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 blood spilled. The -- the photograph shows it spilled.

2 The photograph shows that the -- that the tops had

3 come off. But the -- the photograph also shows --

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but isn't there also

5 evidence that the spillage in the Styrofoam container

6 seemed to be inadequate to account for all of the blood

7 that was missing from the vial?

8 MS. SMITH: I think there was testimony that

9 -- that the appearance of it seemed to be inadequate.

10 There was no specific quantification of the blood, and

11 -- and no one -- no one attempted to do that. It's not

12 clear whether some of the blood leaked out of the

13 container and maybe wasn't contained within it. There

14 were -- there were pieces of gauze that had blood

15 soaked in it. There was also a dispute about the size

16 of the vials.

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's important

18 for this whole question. Quantity relates to chain of

19 custody.

20 MS. SMITH: Your Honor, I think what's

21 important is the point of the spillage. If -- if the

22 blood spilled after it left the FBI lab -- and that was

23 a specific finding made by the district court, and that

24 finding is clearly supported by the record. What

25 happened to the blood, where it spilled after the fact

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 -- and we know that it did spill -- really is -- is

2 beside the point because --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: Another blood question

4 because I -- the -- you make a point of the -- the

5 sheriff having said, well, I -- I saw blood on the

6 jeans. So I looked at the pictures and the pictures

7 seem to have little tiny bits of blood, while a lot of

8 mud. So I came to the conclusion that no reasonable

9 person could think that that testimony really shows

10 that the -- that there was -- there was blood from the

11 -- from the victim on his jeans.

12 Now, am I right about that? You're going to

13 think I'm wrong, and I want to hear why.

14 MS. SMITH: Well, I do think you're wrong,

15 Your Honor, because I -- I think that if you look in

16 the record, there are at least four witnesses who

17 indicated that they saw the blood. One was Special

18 Agent Scott.

19 JUSTICE BREYER: How could you have? It's so

20 tiny.

21 MS. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, the -- the

22 photographs that you have are photographs that are

23 taken after portions of the jeans have been cut out and

24 sent for testing. You're not seeing everything that --

25 that the agent saw. Special Agent Scott saw what he

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 believed to be blood. He couldn't -- he didn't know it

2 was blood, but -- but he suspected it was blood. He

3 identified in -- in the habeas proceeding the areas

4 that he believed it to be blood, and it turned out to

5 be blood.

6 Jerry Morissey, who was the defense

7 serologist and -- and, incidentally, just to -- that

8 reminds me of -- of a comment made by my colleague in

9 his argument about defense counsel's deficiency in not

10 -- in not hiring a serological expert. He had a

11 serological expert. Jerry Morissey testified, was a

12 serologist, and testified that he received the jeans

13 after the FBI tested it. He was unable to duplicate

14 the result, but as part of his testimony, he said that

15 he observed some bloodstains, what he thought to be

16 bloodstains, around the FBI cuttings, and he attempted

17 to do additional testing on those bloodstains. So he

18 saw the stains.

19 Agent Bigbee testified that he observed the

20 stains. He didn't say that some were big or some were

21 small. He said that he observed them.

22 As well, Paulette Sutton in the Federal

23 habeas proceeding said that she saw the stains. She

24 said she couldn't tell upon observation that it was

25 blood, but it was dark and she suspected it was blood.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 It was suspicious.

2 So we have at least four witnesses who say

3 they saw this blood. This wasn't microscopic. This

4 was something that -- that witnesses -- and

5 incidentally, Paulette Sutton's observation was borne

6 out because she did presumptive testing. So the things

7 that -- the spots that she suspected were blood in fact

8 turned out to be blood.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Smith, could -- could

10 you go on to some of the other elements that are

11 contested here? In particular, I'm interested in -- in

12 Mr. Muncey's confession. What -- what do you -- what

13 do you say about that?

14 MS. SMITH: Your Honor, I -- I think of all

15 the evidence presented below, I think that the

16 confession evidence is -- is perhaps the least reliable

17 in terms of -- of the Schlup analysis.

18 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What did the jury hear

19 about Muncey's confession?

20 MS. SMITH: The jury was never informed of

21 Muncey's confession because the --

22 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I thought not.

23 MS. SMITH: -- the fact of Muncey's

24 confession didn't come up until 13-14 years after the

25 trial had already been concluded. And -- and that's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 one of the things that the district court, in -- in

2 examining their testimony, found what was significant

3 in his --

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: But wasn't the district

5 court incorrect in that? Because as I understand it,

6 there was evidence from one of the two witnesses who

7 put in the confession evidence that she had gone to the

8 sheriff's department to -- to tell them about the

9 confession and had simply gotten a runaround and

10 finally left. So as I understand it, the -- the record

11 would not support the finding that -- that the -- the

12 sources of evidence simply kept silent for over a

13 decade.

14 MS. SMITH: Well, that's what the witness

15 testified to, Your Honor.

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is there any reason

17 not -- did the -- did the district court explain that

18 it was rejecting that element of the witnesses'

19 testimonies?

20 MS. SMITH: The district court did not

21 specifically address that element of the witnesses'

22 testimony. The court found that it -- specifically

23 that it was not impressed with the testimony of a

24 witness who waits. And -- and this Court has said on

25 many occasions that --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: I know, but without getting

2 to that point, it sounds as though the district court

3 simply made a mistake, just forgot I suppose, the

4 evidence that the witness didn't wait at all.

5 MS. SMITH: Your Honor, regardless of whether

6 the witness waited or not, the Court examined the

7 credibility of the testimony and found that it wasn't

8 credible.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but one of the reasons

10 for the finding of -- of incredibility was the decade

11 or more of silence.

12 MS. SMITH: That was one of the reasons, but

13 the primary reason that the -- that the confession

14 itself was inconsistent with the other evidence, and

15 that was what the court specifically pointed to in his

16 opinion.

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the -- tell -- help me

18 out here. As -- as has been explored earlier, the

19 confession referred to -- to some of the injuries on

20 the body, but not to all of them. Were there -- were

21 there other disparities between the confession and --

22 and the -- and other evidence?

23 MS. SMITH: There were several disparities,

24 Your Honor. The confession indicates that there was

25 apparently an extensive argument at home. The

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 testimony of the daughter both at trial and in the

2 habeas corpus proceeding was that there was no such

3 argument. She heard no argument. And the court,

4 incidentally, found her testimony to be very credible.

5 He observed her demeanor and -- and found her

6 testimony to be credible. So that's inconsistent.

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, as far as that's

8 concerned, she did testify that there was a car out

9 there.

10 MS. SMITH: That's correct.

11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the rest of the story

12 doesn't -- doesn't put the defendant House at the time

13 of the crime in a car. He's walking.

14 MS. SMITH: Your Honor, the -- the testimony

15 at trial was ambiguous about the -- about the car. The

16 witness identified two separate incidents. She heard a

17 car and she heard someone inquire as to Mr. Muncey's

18 whereabouts, and then she also heard an individual come

19 and tell her -- her mother that her father had been in

20 a wreck down by the creek and heard her mother leave

21 sobbing. Those are two distinct incidences. And Lora

22 Muncey testified that she did not know whether she had

23 gone back to sleep. She never could identify or -- or

24 define the specific length of time between the two.

25 But logically those are two separate

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 incidences. It doesn't make sense for someone to come

2 and ask where Mr. Muncey is and then to say, well, he's

3 down by the creek. He just had a wreck. So it -- it

4 seems that just logically those are two separate

5 incidences, and there's nothing in the -- in the

6 testimony to indicate that -- that they're same.

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they happened at the

8 same time, didn't they? The --

9 MS. SMITH: No, Your Honor. The --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the child testified to

11 what she heard, and I thought she heard a car and

12 someone in a low voice, and then her mother left with

13 that someone.

14 MS. SMITH: No, Your Honor. She heard a car

15 and someone inquire as to the whereabouts of her

16 father, and she heard her mother answer. And then

17 there was a period of time where she said she wasn't

18 sure whether she went back to sleep or not, and then

19 she heard a person with a low voice come in and inform

20 her mother that she -- that -- that her father, Hubert

21 Muncey, Jr., had been in a wreck down by the creek.

22 She heard her mother sob and leave with the individual

23 who had relayed that information. Those are two

24 distinct incidences.

25 But beyond that -- the -- the court,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 incidentally, found her testimony to be very credible,

2 found that her testimony did not support this -- this

3 theory of some sort of confrontation in the house.

4 In addition, the court also heard the live

5 testimony of Hubert Muncey, Jr. himself, explaining his

6 whereabouts, explaining -- and actually denying ever

7 having made the statement. And -- and the court

8 balanced that.

9 As well, Dennis Wallace, who testified at the

10 evidentiary hearing -- he investigated a missing

11 person's report. He was in the home. He saw no

12 evidence of any sort of struggle in the home.

13 So all of these things balanced against this

14 -- this confession, which has absolutely no

15 corroborative support in the record, the court found

16 that the testimony simply wasn't credible.

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it did have

18 corroboration. Wasn't there a -- a wound on the victim

19 that was consistent with -- with the confession?

20 MS. SMITH: There was a -- a wound to the

21 victim's left forehead.

22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Was that not consistent

23 with the confession?

24 MS. SMITH: The confession was that Mr.

25 Muncey hit her and she fell and hit her head.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE STEVENS: You tell me yes or no. Was

2 it -- was it consistent with the confession?

3 MS. SMITH: It -- it could be consistent with

4 the confession. It was -- it was very sketchy. There

5 -- there was a dispute between the two pathologists in

6 the habeas as to whether or not that -- that wound

7 could have been sustained by -- by falling and hitting

8 her head on a table and actually could have created

9 the -- the damage in -- in the brain.

10 JUSTICE BREYER: So overall, if -- looking at

11 this -- and that's why I think the question about the

12 weight to give to the fact finding is important. You

13 think -- you have a theory under which he could have

14 done it, and it's certainly possible in my opinion.

15 But also you think, my goodness, if he did

16 it, going and this luring of the woman to the creek --

17 you know, there's nothing else in the record that

18 suggests he would plot in that way to do this.

19 Nothing. The husband is away at the time from the

20 dance. He could have done it. They are fighting.

21 They could have done it. And if the luring theory

22 correct, the motive was sexual, but the sexual physical

23 evidence is from the husband, not from him.

24 So the jury is brought into this on a theory

25 that there is a sexual attack and the one -- by the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 defendant, and the one thing that seems disproved

2 pretty much is that. And now we have two experts, Dr.

3 Blake and Dr. Bigbee. And reading a page, which I

4 hadn't read thoroughly until you pointed it out, I'd

5 say they might disagree. They might disagree. And

6 it's just not conclusive.

7 So if you're sitting there, do you have to

8 have a reasonable doubt when there's such strong

9 evidence for both people? And -- and the part that's

10 bothering me -- I -- I see what that district judge

11 said on that one point, which he may have thought was

12 peripheral but it turns out to be quite important about

13 when the blood spilled. But if you look to the

14 underlying thing and I think, well, maybe you're right,

15 but maybe you're not right.

16 And so how do -- how do I -- how do I do

17 this? What's the -- what's the weighing? I sit there

18 and think, my goodness, I don't know who committed this

19 crime if I'd been on that jury. And could -- could a

20 person sitting there reasonably come to a conclusion,

21 my goodness, I know?

22 MS. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I think to

23 answer your question is if you are at that mental state

24 where you are saying maybe this evidence is right, maybe

25 that -- that evidence is right, maybe I can go one way

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 or another, then I think the respondent prevails in this

2 case --

3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but that -- that simply

4 says if the -- it seems to me you're simply saying there

5 would be sufficient evidence to go the one way rather

6 than the other. And -- and you may well be right about

7 that, but that certainly is not the reasonable doubt

8 standard.

9 MS. SMITH: I think it goes beyond just

10 having sufficient evidence to convict, Your Honor. I

11 think you also look at these credibility determinations

12 and you look at the probabilistic result of a

13 reasonable juror.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Justice Breyer has not heard

15 these witnesses and hasn't had the opportunity to know

16 whether -- whether, for example, these -- this

17 testimony about the confession was credible or not.

18 MS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor.

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the hearer of -- at the

20 trial did have that opportunity.

21 MS. SMITH: The district court heard both of

22 the -- both of the sisters regarding the confession.

23 The district court heard Hubert Muncey, Jr. regarding

24 the alleged confession.

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but may I interrupt

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you? What -- what about -- I want to just follow up on

2 something that Justice Breyer alluded to and that is

3 the significance of the DNA evidence. And I have

4 tended to -- to think that a reasonable juror would

5 look at it this way, but if I'm wrong, I -- I want you

6 to comment on it.

7 One of the -- I -- I assume, to begin with,

8 that any reasonable juror would have found this

9 evidence, the evidence of the semen stains, extremely

10 significant because not only did the State argue rape

11 as a -- as a motive, possible motive, but there was a

12 specific finding of an aggravated circumstance that the

13 murder occurred in the course of kidnapping and rape.

14 I don't know of any evidence that would suggest an --

15 an independent kidnapping crime without the rape

16 element under, you know, the circumstances of -- of

17 this crime. So I'm -- I -- I assume that the

18 reasonable juror, having come to the conclusion that

19 that aggravating circumstance is true, found that a

20 rape was being committed.

21 If that juror had heard the DNA evidence,

22 that juror would have said the only positive evidence

23 that a rape was committed here would be evidence that

24 pointed to the husband, not in fact to -- to the

25 defendant House. And if -- if a juror had heard that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 evidence, it seems to me it is highly unlikely that any

2 reasonable juror would have concluded that that

3 aggravating circumstance was found, and I suppose that

4 would play a -- a significant role in -- in the

5 ultimate conclusion.

6 Now, you have argued that the fact that the

7 DNA evidence shows that it was the husband's fluids,

8 not House's, doesn't conclusively prove that House

9 didn't rape her, and of course, you're right. But my

10 understanding is that there is no evidence from which

11 one would reasonably infer that House did this.

12 Now, what is -- what is your comment on that

13 --

14 MS. SMITH: My comment -- sorry.

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- analysis?

16 MS. SMITH: My comment on the DNA evidence is

17 that the DNA evidence did nothing more than confirm

18 what the jury was -- already knew was very likely,

19 which was that the donor of the semen was the husband.

20 The jury at trial was informed that the husband -- and

21 it went through several pages. In the joint appendix,

22 it goes all the way from page 56 to 66 where we're

23 exploring that the semen could have been deposited by

24 the husband or by Mr. House.

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there was a finding

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that it was in the course of the rape.

2 MS. SMITH: There was --

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That was part of that.

4 That was -- that was one of the -- was it one of three

5 aggravating circumstances?

6 MS. SMITH: One of three, and -- and that was

7 --

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It was found at the guilt

9 phase or the trial phase, the aggravating circumstance?

10 MS. SMITH: It was at -- it was an

11 aggravating circumstance of sentencing, that -- that

12 the murder was perpetrated in the -- in the attempt --

13 in -- in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate

14 kidnapping or rape or attempted rape.

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then at -- at a

16 minimum, it seems to me that the sentencing phase is --

17 is in question by that.

18 But also, it seems to me if I were a juror

19 and was faced with these conflicting things, I would

20 look for motive.

21 MS. SMITH: Your Honor, the motive is -- is

22 well supported by the circumstances. And in fact, if

23 you look at the prosecutor's argument --

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is evidence of rape

25 besides -- besides the semen. The semen wasn't the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 only evidence of rape, was it?

2 MS. SMITH: No, sir, it wasn't.

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: There were scratches on the

4 thighs.

5 MS. SMITH: There was --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but the semen was

7 used to -- to connect it to the -- to the defendant,

8 and we now know that that's wrong.

9 MS. SMITH: The prosecutor argued at trial on

10 the motive question, why else would someone lure a

11 woman out of her home with a lie in the middle of the

12 night in her night clothes and take her out into the

13 woods, if not to have some sort of --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Who put in the evidence --

15 who put in the semen evidence?

16 MS. SMITH: The State put in the semen

17 evidence, Your Honor.

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: They did that to prove

19 she had sex with her husband? Is that the reason?

20 (Laughter.)

21 MS. SMITH: The State put in the semen

22 evidence because it was -- it was not inconsistent with

23 Mr. House and that there was other evidence in the

24 record that was not -- all of the -- all this -- this

25 physical evidence was consistent with Mr. House, just

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 as the semen was.

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get back to

4 this -- the standard of review question? Because it

5 goes directly to this point. Even if you think that

6 the argument based on the semen is not harmless error,

7 in other words, that the prior jury may well have

8 convicted based on that, we're not reviewing that

9 jury's determination. Correct?

10 MS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor.

11 You're looking at how -- how a reasonable juror would

12 view the case if it knew --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we should be

14 looking at the case with the semen evidence showing

15 what we know it to show, regardless of whether we think

16 the prior jury was misled by the admission of that

17 evidence.

18 MS. SMITH: That's absolutely correct, Your

19 Honor. If -- if the -- if a reasonable jury knew that

20 the semen belonged to Mr. -- belonged to Mr. Muncey and

21 not Mr. House, the result would be exactly the same

22 because Carolyn Muncey's blood was all over Mr. House's

23 pants. That is an indisputable fact. And all of this

24 --

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about at the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

53

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 sentencing stage? Justice Kennedy brought it up. The

2 -- the prosecutor didn't emphasize unduly the semen at

3 the -- at the guilt stage but, boy, made a big deal out

4 of it at the sentencing stage.

5 MS. SMITH: Your Honor, I disagree that --

6 that they made a big deal. They made a big deal of

7 the kidnapping at the sentencing phase. That was --

8 that was of significance. The -- what the prosecutor

9 did --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where was it in the -- in

11 the joint appendix? I thought it was more than

12 kidnapping.

13 MS. SMITH: Your Honor, the -- the sentencing

14 phase argument is not contained in -- in the joint

15 appendix. The closing argument from the guilt phase is

16 contained in -- in the joint appendix, but it's

17 certainly in the -- in the transcripts before the

18 Court.

19 What -- what the prosecutor focused on at

20 sentencing was -- was the kidnapping and also was the

21 malice and -- and I'm sorry -- the -- specifically the

22 kidnapping --

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Said nothing about the

24 semen --

25 MS. SMITH: The --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

54

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- at the -- at the

2 sentencing stage?

3 MS. SMITH: At the sentencing phase, the

4 prosecutor said that the evidence would have been

5 consistent with sexual molestation, I think was the

6 word that he used.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Smith.

8 MS. SMITH: Thank you, Your Honor.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kissinger, you

10 have 4 minutes remaining.

11 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. KISSINGER

12 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13 MR. KISSINGER: Very quickly. Dr. Blake's

14 testimony was not, in fact, discredited. Counsel for

15 respondent says that -- places great significance on --

16 on Dr. Blake's interpretation of the initials inc as

17 standing for incomplete penetration, and that --

18 correctly that should have been construed as

19 inconclusive. Counsel fails to acknowledge the record

20 -- record 4 of the district court, volume 6, page 906.

21 Agent Bigbee himself uses the term inc to mean -- or

22 incomplete, just as Dr. Blake did. So in addition to

23 Dr. Blake saying, yes, I meant the same thing as

24 Justice Breyer observed, Justice Bigbee himself uses

25 the term inc to mean incomplete.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

55

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Page 282 of the joint

2 appendix, he says inconclusive is what the inc stands

3 for. Dr. Blake testified it is incomplete penetration,

4 which I haven't the foggiest idea what that means.

5 MR. KISSINGER: And that's correct, Your

6 Honor. In trial, he used -- he said that inc stands

7 for incomplete, and then Agent Bigbee at trial

8 proceeded to use incomplete and inconclusive

9 interchangeably just as Dr. Blake did.

10 In addition, when -- concerning Dr. Blake's

11 testimony, we have to remember that we still have the

12 missing tube of blood, and the blood on the jeans is

13 more consistent with blood coming from the degraded

14 blood sample than it is from blood which came -- got on

15 the jeans during the time of the offense.

16 The other thing, which I think is an

17 important matter to -- to keep in -- keep in mind

18 regarding Dr. Blake's testimony and Dr. Bigbee's, is

19 that Dr. Blake and Agent Bigbee both agree on the basic

20 science that blood enzymes deteriorate according the

21 various environmental factors and that as they

22 deteriorate, they become less detectable.

23 In terms of the -- the implicit credibility

24 findings, which respondent relies upon, the district

25 court during its opinion demonstrated that it know --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

56

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 it knew how to make credibility findings. In fact, it

2 made two specific credibility findings in this case

3 when it found Mr. House's testimony to be incredible

4 and the testimony of Lora Muncey to be credible.

5 As far as the -- the suggestion that, yes,

6 there was -- the crime scene was wet, that that -- that

7 there was water at -- or there's a possibility of mud

8 at the crime scene, not only is this contradicted by

9 the absence of the mud -- of mud on the victim's

10 clothing, but also the drizzling which counsel

11 described occurred on the day following the murder, not

12 before it happened, not at the time the murder was

13 occurring, but on the day following the murder. So, in

14 fact, there was -- the murder scene was dry, just as

15 petitioner has informed the Court.

16 As far as the daughter not hearing any sign

17 of a struggle, the daughter's testimony was that she

18 did not hear any sign of a struggle when she got up

19 immediately after her mother left the home. The

20 testimony at the evidentiary hearing, unrebutted and

21 unimpeached, was that at that point in time when she

22 was hearing nothing, her mother was, in fact, at the

23 C&C Recreation Center involved in a fight with Hubert

24 Muncey, Jr. In fact, that testimony goes to Mr.

25 House's innocence because at the time she hears

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

57

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 nothing, she hears no sign of a struggle, is the very

2 time that the State of Tennessee contended that Mr.

3 House was out murdering Carolyn Muncey, and yet the

4 daughter who was outside of the home within 50 yards of

5 where this murder occurred heard absolutely nothing.

6 Justice Scalia asked was there, in fact,

7 other evidence of -- of rape. Wasn't there, in fact,

8 bruises found on her thighs? On cross examination, the

9 pathologist testified, admitted on cross examination,

10 that the scratches on Ms. Muncey's thighs were more

11 likely attributable to her being dragged through the

12 brush and her body being hidden which, incidentally, is

13 an act which Mr. Muncey confessed to doing.

14 In addition, as I stated before, the evidence

15 has to be viewed in light of the entirety of the

16 evidence of the record. It isn't just the blood

17 evidence. It isn't just the semen evidence. It isn't

18 even just the confession. It's also the fact that the

19 same witness who puts Mr. Muncey -- or who puts Mr.

20 House even leaving the Donna Turner home on the night

21 of the murder puts Mr. House leaving the home at a --

22 thank you, Your Honor.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

24 The case is submitted.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400
