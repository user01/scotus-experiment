 2 (10:16 a.m.)
 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 now in No. 00-1543, Festo Corporation v. Shoketsu Kinzoku
 5 Kogyo Kabushiki. I hope I got that right. 
 6 (Laughter.) 
 7 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Bork.
 8 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK
 9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 10 MR. BORK: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the
 11 Court:
 12 I refer to them as SMC. 
 13 (Laughter.) 
 14 MR. BORK: The Federal circuit's rules in this
 15 case ought to be reversed because it flatly contradicts
 16 this Court's decision in Warner-Jenkinson, and
 17 furthermore, it radically undermines the patent system. I
 18 think Warner-Jenkinson should be reaffirmed because it's
 19 in keeping with the Patent Act, with the goals and
 20 policies of the patent system, and because it is much
 21 fairer than the harsh inequities of this new rule which
 22 this case presents a prime example. 
 23 Warner -- let me discuss the crucial differences
 24 between Warner-Jenkinson and the Federal circuit's new
 25 rules. 

3 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 In the first place, Warner-Jenkinson holds that
 2 prosecution history estoppel arises only when an amendment
 3 to a patent surrenders subject matter -- and clearly
 4 surrenders it -- in order to achieve patentability. The
 5 Federal circuit holds to the contrary that any narrowing
 6 amendment, regardless of the reason for it, creates
 7 prosecution history estoppel. 
 8 Second, the Warner-Jenkinson case holds that the
 9 reason for an amendment determines whether an estoppel is
 10 created. The Federal circuit denies that and holds that
 11 the reason is irrelevant, and if an amendment has the
 12 narrowing effect, intended or not, it creates a complete
 13 estoppel. Thus, if the patent examiner said he found the
 14 claims to be imprecise and the applicant made an amendment
 15 to clarify what the examiner thought was imprecise, that
 16 might be held to be a narrowing amendment and the patent
 17 would be unenforceable. And that is what happened to
 18 Festo in this case. And those results cannot be squared
 19 with Warner-Jenkinson. 
 20 Third, the Federal circuit holds that an
 21 amendment creates an estoppel if it applies to any of the
 22 statutory requirements for obtaining a patent, not just
 23 patent -- not just patentability as defined by the Patent
 24 Act, but any of the requirements for obtaining a patent.
 25 Now, the Patent Act makes clear a distinction

4 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 between patentability and other requirements. Sections
 2 101 through 103 come under the heading of patentability of
 3 inventions, and they state the substantive requirements
 4 for getting a patent. The invention must be new and
 5 useful. It must be not found in the prior art, and it
 6 must not be obvious. Those are the only elements of
 7 patentability known in the law. And this Court's opinion
 8 in Graham against John Deere confirms that. No other
 9 requirement of the statute relates to patentability. 
 10 The Federal circuit holds to the contrary, that
 11 an amendment affecting any of the statutory requirements
 12 for getting a patent may generate estoppel, and those
 13 requirements include sections 111 and 112 of the act. But
 14 those sections relate to the form of the application and
 15 not to the subject matter sought to be patented. 
 16 QUESTION: Is it clear most of the time, Mr.
 17 Bork, whether the amendment is for purposes of 103, 111,
 18 and 112? Can you pick up the patent history and -- and
 19 tell at a glance whether it's a 103 or a 111 and 112
 20 purpose that generated the amendment? 
 21 MR. BORK: I think one can. For example, in
 22 this case you'll see in the Stoll patent -- there are two
 23 patents, of course, in play here, the Stoll patent and the
 24 Carroll patent. In this case, the patent examiner says
 25 that he objects on the grounds that the claim is stated in

5 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 an improper form, is multiply dependent, and also that
 2 it's imprecise. He's not sure what it means. Now, that
 3 is quite clear that those are 111 and 112 objections, not
 4 to the subject matter sought to be patented. 
 5 QUESTION: But if you're the applicant and you
 6 get that response from the Patent Office, during the
 7 course of the amendment might you not rethink and -- and
 8 clarify what you're doing under 103 as well? That's
 9 what --
 10 MR. BORK: Oh, if the -- if the applicant
 11 decides to amend in a way that surrenders subject matter,
 12 it disclaims subject matter, the fact that the process
 13 began with a -- with the examiner's on grounds of form
 14 doesn't affect it. If he surrenders subject matter, that
 15 subject matter is gone and the equivalents to it are gone
 16 too. 
 17 QUESTION: But wasn't that the argument here
 18 with reference to the seals and the magnetized or
 19 demagnetized cylinder? 
 20 MR. BORK: There was an argument to that effect,
 21 but if you look at the patent -- at the prosecution
 22 history which is of both the Stoll and the Carroll
 23 patents, which are in the volume 2 of the transcript,
 24 there is no abandonment of any subject matter. 
 25 In the Stoll patent, there is no abandonment of

6 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 subject matter. In the Carroll patent, there is. 
 2 However, the subject matter which was abandoned had no
 3 relevance to the lawsuit. It wasn't what was -- what was
 4 sued on, so that there is, in operational terms, no
 5 disclaimer or surrender of subject matter in either of
 6 these patents. 
 7 QUESTION: Mr. Bork, both the Solicitor General
 8 and an amicus, the IEEE, suggest that a -- a different
 9 flexible bar test would be appropriate. Would you comment
 10 on those two proposals? 
 11 MR. BORK: Justice O'Connor, I think they're
 12 much too narrow. The only rationale that makes any sense
 13 as to a flexible bar proposal or any bar proposal is that
 14 if you've disclaimed something, then the equivalent of
 15 subject matter -- the equivalents to the disclaimed
 16 subject matter are barred by estoppel, but other
 17 equivalents that don't go to what was surrendered are not
 18 barred. Therefore, the -- the rule of the -- the bar, the
 19 question of the scope of the bar, relates closely to the
 20 question -- the first question presented in this case --
 21 QUESTION: Let's say there's --
 22 MR. BORK: -- as to what was surrendered. 
 23 QUESTION: Let's say there's an amendment under
 24 103 where -- where you agree that there can be an
 25 estoppel. Should there be a presumption there? 

7 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. BORK: A presumption -- if there is a clear
 2 surrender, there's no presumption. It's -- it's a -- it's
 3 a waiver. It's -- you've estopped yourself. If it's
 4 unclear what -- why you have done it, then this Court in
 5 Warner-Jenkinson says there be a remand under a
 6 presumption that what you did was for purposes of
 7 patentability, what you surrendered was for purposes of
 8 patentability, and if you cannot rebut that presumption,
 9 then you lose. 
 10 QUESTION: Wasn't it more, Mr. Bork, than just a
 11 presumption if you couldn't -- I thought Warner-Jenkinson
 12 said where you do not establish any reason for the
 13 amendment, the Court did use the word presume. It said
 14 the Court should presume that the patent application has a
 15 substantial reason relating to patentability. And then
 16 the following sentence is, in those circumstances,
 17 prosecution history estoppel would bar the application of
 18 the doctrine of equivalents. So, that sounds to me like
 19 an absolute bar rule, that if you don't -- if the reason
 20 is unexplained, the consequence is a complete bar. 
 21 MR. BORK: Oh, well, consequence is a bar as to
 22 that. Yes, as to that area. But I guess I perhaps didn't
 23 express myself well. 
 24 If the appellate court, this Court, looks and
 25 says, I don't know the reason -- as in Warner-Jenkinson,

8 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 it was unclear why there was a lower limit of pH 6 set on
 2 that process -- I don't know -- I don't know why you
 3 amended to set that lower limit, there is a presumption
 4 that you did it for a reason related to patentability,
 5 which would create a complete bar. However, on remand,
 6 you get a chance to rebut that presumption with evidence. 
 7 If you don't rebut it, it's a bar. 
 8 QUESTION: The -- the Federal circuit is
 9 supposed to be an expert in this and they say that
 10 inventors or people who are trying to invent things are
 11 supposed to be able to read the claims, and that's it. 
 12 And if you didn't make your claim properly, particularly
 13 when you had a second chance, that's your problem, and any
 14 other system -- any other system is going to really go
 15 back to what used to be called central claiming where the
 16 claims point to rather than define the invention. And
 17 that's just not workable today. We'll get an equivalents
 18 claim in every case. And so, let's make an exception
 19 where the lawyer couldn't really do anything about it. 
 20 That's called unforeseeability. 
 21 MR. BORK: Well, the fact --
 22 QUESTION: With that possible exception, which
 23 they maybe should have mentioned but didn't, it's up to
 24 the lawyer and it's his fault. And the reason is if he
 25 didn't do it properly, we punish him because we have to

9 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 have certainty for people who want to invent other things. 
 2 Now, that I take it is the heart of what's being said on
 3 the other side, and I'd like to know your response. 
 4 MR. BORK: Well, there are a couple of responses
 5 to that, Justice Breyer. 
 6 In the first place, let me say that the solution
 7 the Federal circuit has devised is -- doesn't relate to
 8 the problem. If the problem is the unworkability of the
 9 equivalents test, then the answer is to abolish
 10 equivalents, not to -- and that doesn't depend on whether
 11 or not there's been an amendment. And if you're going to
 12 abolish equivalents, the way to do it, so that you don't
 13 have this terrible retroactive effect, is to have the
 14 Patent and Trademark Office engage in a rulemaking
 15 function, a rulemaking which has a prospective effect
 16 only, or have Congress sit down and do a rule -- legislate
 17 that has a prospective effect only. 
 18 QUESTION: Would the PTO have authority to do
 19 that by regulation in the absence of congressional
 20 authorization? 
 21 MR. BORK: I think it has authorization to do --
 22 to make rules of that sort, Mr. Chief Justice.
 23 But on the -- on the question that -- I'm sorry,
 24 Justice Breyer. 
 25 QUESTION: They're not arguing for abolition. 

10 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 They're not arguing for abolition. 
 2 MR. BORK: No --
 3 QUESTION: They're arguing for hold the lawyer
 4 to a very tough standard, but a small equitable exception
 5 in the instance where the lawyer really couldn't really do
 6 anything about it, namely where it's not foreseeable that
 7 this kind of really copied device is going to come
 8 about --
 9 MR. BORK: Well --
 10 QUESTION: -- because the language isn't -- you
 11 know, English doesn't work perfectly, the English
 12 language, and because there could be future inventions
 13 that might cause that to be unforeseeable. 
 14 MR. BORK: That is true, but what they have
 15 suggested in effect is that the lawyer put into the
 16 literal claims he files a claim for all the equivalents
 17 that he can foresee. Now, he can't foresee most of the
 18 equivalents, and if he did that, I think you'd have a
 19 patent claim that would look roughly like the tax code.
 20 QUESTION: No, because they have ways of doing
 21 it. They say all the things like, or they say -- you
 22 know, I can't remember. There's a special technical word
 23 for it where you -- you try to do it in terms of function. 
 24 There are ways of doing it. 
 25 MR. BORK: Function, way and result. 

11 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: And the briefs are filled -- you
 2 know, the briefs are filled with them, how -- how easy it
 3 is. The other side says, no, no, it's very easy, and your
 4 side says, oh, really? It isn't so easy. 
 5 MR. BORK: Well, you're referring, I think,
 6 Justice Breyer, to the testing of -- for equivalents
 7 called function, way and result? 
 8 QUESTION: No, no. I'm not thinking -- I'm not
 9 thinking that. I'm thinking there's a -- there is a way
 10 of drafting a claim where you put in the claim -- you
 11 don't describe the thing exactly. You describe what the
 12 thing does. 
 13 MR. BORK: Well, if you do that, Justice Breyer,
 14 I don't think you've solved the problem of unworkability. 
 15 I don't think it's unworkable in the first place, but I
 16 don't think you've solved the problem of the litigation
 17 that's going to take place and the difficulty judges are
 18 going to have in distinguishing the case that is covered
 19 from the case that is not covered. I think it's exactly
 20 the same problem as you'd get with the application of the
 21 doctrine of equivalents. 
 22 QUESTION: May I ask? I've had a lot of trouble
 23 understanding this patent, to be very honest with you. 
 24 Some patents I can understand. This one I found very
 25 difficult. And one of your -- the changes, as I

12 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 understand it, is in the early draft of the claim there
 2 was no reference to the nonmagnetic material that was used
 3 in the tube and that that was the -- that was one of the
 4 changes that -- that was made. And your suggestion is
 5 that was -- had nothing to do with the subject --
 6 patentability. It's just change of description or
 7 something like that, if I understand you. 
 8 But the patent itself seems to be a patent on a
 9 magnetic relationship between different elements of the --
 10 of the item, and just at first blush, it seemed to me that
 11 a -- that a -- an element that described a nonmagnetic
 12 material would be rather important. And your position is
 13 it's of no importance. Could you just comment a little
 14 bit on this problem for me --
 15 MR. BORK: Yes, the --
 16 QUESTION: -- so I can get a better
 17 understanding of it? 
 18 MR. BORK: The Festo patent specified a
 19 magnetized material in the tube, and SMC used a aluminum
 20 alloy. 
 21 QUESTION: This is in the Stoll patent I think,
 22 isn't it? 
 23 MR. BORK: Yes. 
 24 And SMC used a aluminum alloy, which is not
 25 magnetizable material. However, it does conduct magnetism

13 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 well enough -- very slightly, but well enough -- to
 2 complete the circuit and to do what the Festo patent does
 3 so that it is an equivalent in that sense to the
 4 magnetizable sleeve. If it were pure aluminum, it
 5 wouldn't conduct the magnetism, but it isn't. It's an
 6 alloy. 
 7 QUESTION: Suppose that I was going to buy your
 8 product and I knew what the German patents contained and
 9 you were trying to sell it to me, and I asked you this. 
 10 What does your product do that the product covered by the
 11 German patents doesn't do? What would you say? 
 12 MR. BORK: Well, I think I would -- I would
 13 point to the sealing rings and the magnetizable --
 14 QUESTION: Exactly, and -- and therefore, they
 15 are saying that's at the heart of this thing. The sealing
 16 rings enabled the -- enabled you to use a larger piston
 17 because it could come closer to the side of the cylinder. 
 18 And here they've copied -- they -- they -- so, you defined
 19 it this way, we didn't follow it. 
 20 MR. BORK: I beg your pardon? You defined it
 21 this way and they didn't follow it? They did follow it.
 22 The only difference between their -- our claim said four
 23 rings: two guide rings and two sealing rings. They had
 24 two guide rings and one sealing ring. 
 25 QUESTION: Exactly, but the heart of your

14 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 invention was a way of wiping the inside of the tube --
 2 MR. BORK: The outside. 
 3 QUESTION: -- as I understand it, so that the
 4 piston could come closer to the inside of the tube. And
 5 you defined that by using two rings. And they say, well,
 6 that's what the heart of the invention was, these two
 7 rings, and we didn't use two rings. 
 8 MR. BORK: They used --
 9 QUESTION: We used one ring. 
 10 MR. BORK: They used one ring which performed
 11 exactly the same function. 
 12 QUESTION: That's -- you say it performed
 13 exactly the same. They say it didn't quite work quite as
 14 well.
 15 MR. BORK: Well --
 16 QUESTION: And now this is the heart of the
 17 problem. 
 18 MR. BORK: I don't know that they --
 19 QUESTION: The -- let me show you why. Because
 20 the Federal circuit is saying inventors generally have to
 21 put this kind of an issue before a jury or a judge who
 22 doesn't understand it too well. And that's why there's a
 23 lack of certainty and that's why we have to have the rule
 24 we have. 
 25 MR. BORK: If they put before the jury or the

15 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 judge the question of whether a narrowing has taken place,
 2 they'll be litigating just as much and there will be just
 3 as much uncertainty as there is on whether this thing is
 4 substantially the same as that thing. You -- this -- one
 5 thing this new rule does not do is eliminate uncertainty. 
 6 In fact, we will -- it just shifts the area of litigation,
 7 so that I don't think that anything is solved by this. 
 8 It just -- nothing is solved by it and you pay
 9 an enormous price in terms of future patents. If you look
 10 at future patents, the future patentee knows he's not
 11 going to get the same protection he had before because if
 12 he dares to amend -- and almost all patents are amended. 
 13 It's just inevitable. That's the way -- that's the way
 14 the process goes. If he's -- if he amends and if an
 15 amendment is requested by the examiner, he can either
 16 refuse it and appeal. That adds about 4 years to the
 17 time, to the 2 years the prosecution history usually
 18 takes. Now, the patent started running when you filed. 
 19 So, now you've lost 6 years, the most valuable years under
 20 your patent. And nobody is going to like that. 
 21 Or he can turn to the trade secret system, or he
 22 can file a claim so narrow that they -- they don't fully
 23 protect what he's invented but also that don't require
 24 amendments. The -- if you -- if you get patents of that
 25 sort, which are of very little value, you don't protect

16 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the innovation function that patents are supposed to
 2 protect. Pfizer and other amici have pointed out that to
 3 get a drug to market costs in excess of $100 million. 
 4 Nobody is going to spend over $100 million to
 5 commercialize a product that cannot be protected. So,
 6 you've done -- you've done an enormous amount of damage to
 7 the innovation process in this thing. 
 8 Worse --
 9 QUESTION: Mr. Bork, --
 10 MR. BORK: -- the people who are really hard hit
 11 are the people, -- the 1,200,000 patents that are
 12 outstanding now because those people had no warning. When
 13 they -- when they got their patents, amendments were
 14 freely made, and that was just the way it worked. The
 15 examiner and the patent attorney sat down and they
 16 exchanged views and they worked it out and they amended to
 17 satisfy the examiner. Now all of those patents are
 18 virtually worthless, which is a --
 19 QUESTION: May I just ask you a question about
 20 they're virtually worthless because the doctrine of
 21 equivalents is not available to those patentees? That's
 22 -- that's basically the point, is it? 
 23 MR. BORK: That's right. Well, that's right. 
 24 QUESTION: Now, the one thing I didn't --
 25 there's a volume of briefs in the file here and I can't

17 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 say I've read them all, but do the briefs anywhere tell us
 2 what percentage of all -- successful infringement claims
 3 rest on the doctrine of equivalents? 
 4 MR. BORK: I don't recall that the briefs ever
 5 do tell us that. 
 6 QUESTION: Because your assumption is that a
 7 very significant portion must be based on --
 8 MR. BORK: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Well --
 9 QUESTION: Because there's a lot of -- a lot of
 10 cases in which it's just an infringement, a literal
 11 infringement.
 12 MR. BORK: That's true, but if a -- if a --
 13 QUESTION: And that area is not touched by this.
 14 MR. BORK: No, but if a copyist wants to avoid
 15 literal infringement, he takes an amended element and
 16 alters it slightly, and he's home free under the Federal
 17 circuit rule. And that's what happened here. You have a
 18 device which, for all practical purposes, is identical to
 19 the Festo patents and has now destroyed the value of the
 20 Festo patents because Festo didn't foresee back in the
 21 1980's, when it got these patents, that the Federal
 22 circuit was going to change the law as it has in 1997. 
 23 And I --
 24 QUESTION: Or it didn't foresee that there
 25 wasn't really a big difference between nonmagnetic

18 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 material and magnetic material. I'm not using the right
 2 words, but it didn't foresee that something he -- they
 3 described as significant in the claims was really not
 4 significant. 
 5 MR. BORK: Well, it's significant enough. The
 6 -- the fact is that the aluminum alloy -- the alloy makes
 7 it perform the same function as the magnetizable material,
 8 and what they didn't foresee was that the law was going to
 9 change so that the amendment was going to destroy their
 10 patent.
 11 QUESTION: Mr. Bork, would you -- would you
 12 comment on the Federal circuit's view that they weren't
 13 really changing anything, but they had two inconsistent
 14 lines of decisions? One was the complete bar rule and the
 15 other was the flexible rule.
 16 MR. BORK: I think they had two decisions that
 17 in -- in some sense were regarded as -- they claimed to be
 18 complete bar rules. I think that's a -- that's quite a
 19 stretch. If you look at the uninterrupted Supreme Court
 20 precedent, there is no case like what the Federal circuit
 21 has done now. The doctrine of equivalents has been around
 22 for over 150 years, and this Court has consistently
 23 applied it. And they -- there was no complete bar in the
 24 Supreme Court jurisprudence. I don't think there's much
 25 -- any complete bar in the Federal circuit jurisprudence

19 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 either, but whatever it was, everybody went forward on the
 2 understanding that the kind of law that was reaffirmed in
 3 Warner-Jenkinson was the law. 
 4 And that's why I find it particularly odd that
 5 the Government should say that those people are charged
 6 with knowledge back then of what was going to happen now.
 7 And that is doubly odd because the Government in
 8 Warner-Jenkinson filed a brief taking the position that we
 9 take here today, and now they say that we should have
 10 known better. They didn't know better. I don't know how
 11 we would know better.
 12 I should like to reserve the remainder of my
 13 time, if I may. 
 14 QUESTION: May I ask you, before you step down,
 15 whether you think there's a relevant difference between
 16 claim elements and claim limitations? 
 17 MR. BORK: I think -- I think they're two words
 18 for the same thing. 
 19 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Bork. 
 20 Mr. Wallace, we'll hear from you. 
 21 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE
 22 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
 23 SUPPORTING VACATUR AND REMAND
 24 QUESTION: Mr. Wallace, Mr. Bork says the
 25 Government has changed its position from the time it filed

20 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 its brief in Warner-Jenkinson. Do you agree with that?
 2 MR. WALLACE: I do not, Mr. Chief Justice. We
 3 did say that amendments made to avoid prior art and
 4 amendments made for other purposes relating to securing
 5 the patent present different problems because amendments
 6 made to avoid prior art are almost always narrowing
 7 amendments, and we think that the Federal circuit, in
 8 speaking of narrowing amendments, really was speaking of
 9 surrendering subject matter which is the formulation that
 10 the petitioner prefers; whereas, amendments made for other
 11 purposes have to be scrutinized with particular care
 12 because they often are not narrowing amendments. And
 13 indeed, in some of the post-Festo decisions of the Federal
 14 circuit, the court has held that there was -- it was not a
 15 narrowing amendment and therefore there's no bar. 
 16 But they can be narrowing amendments. They can
 17 be, even though in the guise of addressing the examiner's
 18 concern under 112, they could actually be narrowing the
 19 subject matter of the claim. And in that instance, the --
 20 the estoppel would apply. 
 21 QUESTION: How does one figure that out? Give
 22 us a -- an example. Part of the argument is this is very
 23 difficult to figure out, that -- that the new system
 24 that's -- that's been brought in is -- is as complicated
 25 to administer in -- in the courts as -- as the old. 

21 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. WALLACE: A simple example would be in
 2 Warner-Jenkinson itself. If there was an addition of a
 3 limitation on the pH levels from 6 to 9 in the amendment,
 4 if the examiner in that case had said that the
 5 specifications are not clear enough and that amendment was
 6 added in response to that, even though the examiner had
 7 raised other concerns, but the applicant purported to add
 8 that limitation in response to the examiner's concerns
 9 about the specificity, it still would be adding a
 10 limitation and it would be an implied disclaimer of 
 11 subject matter in comparison with the initial claim. And
 12 our view would be that estoppel would apply.
 13 QUESTION: But the idea of estoppel, as I
 14 understand it, is that a person is prevented from taking
 15 contrary positions, and it seems to me in your example
 16 that it's not necessarily a contrary position. 
 17 MR. WALLACE: Well, it's contrary in the sense
 18 of what fair inferences can be drawn by the public from
 19 the record of the prosecution history. When he started
 20 off -- the applicant started off without this limitation
 21 and then added the limitation, the limitation speaks for
 22 itself in narrowing the scope of the claim elements. And
 23 that -- that is the central problem of this case. 
 24 If prosecution history estoppel is to have
 25 meaningful effect, once we settle where it applies, which

22 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 seems to me to be the lesser question, it necessarily
 2 follows, if it's to have meaningful effect, that the claim
 3 elements that have been narrowed by the patent applicant,
 4 in order to secure the issuance of the patent, cannot be
 5 afforded the same or almost the same protection against
 6 non-literal infringement that would be available to them
 7 under the doctrine of equivalents if they had not been
 8 narrowed.
 9 QUESTION: Is there -- is there a way of doing
 10 this? Look, the Federal circuit itself thinks that its
 11 rule is a crude effort to deal with a problem that may
 12 have the adverse consequences that -- that Mr. Bork
 13 predicted. And if so, they'll want to change their minds. 
 14 Now, is there a way under the law that they could have the
 15 authority to change their minds if it turns out that this
 16 experiment doesn't work? 
 17 MR. WALLACE: Well, I -- I think so. These are
 18 doctrines that have been developed. Prosecution history
 19 estoppel and its effects are really equitable in origin,
 20 and the courts have the authority to reexamine the
 21 application of equitable doctrines in light of experience.
 22 The -- the real question here, as we see it, is
 23 what -- how do you reconcile the inferences that are
 24 legitimately to be drawn by the public with the
 25 patentholder's need for protection from unfair copying. 

23 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 And this is not a matter of small moment because if -- the
 2 doctrine of equivalents does not apply, but the all-
 3 elements test still is applicable, as the opinions below
 4 reflect, to claims of literal infringement or non-literal
 5 infringement. 
 6 So, we have suggested an answer that we draw
 7 directly from this Court's decisions. We first look at
 8 Exhibit Supply, a 1942 decision, in which the Court said
 9 that when the applicant narrows the claim, he necessarily
 10 is recognizing the difference between what was originally
 11 acclaimed -- claimed and what the narrowing amendment
 12 claims, and there's an implied disclaimer of all that is
 13 embraced within that difference. And he's recognizing the
 14 significance of that difference. And it -- the Court
 15 cited a number of its prior decisions at that time. 
 16 So, we think that applicants have been fairly on
 17 notice that prosecution history estoppel does apply to
 18 narrowing amendments and that there is considerable risk
 19 in narrowing claims and that they have to do that with
 20 great care with that in mind. 
 21 QUESTION: Mr. Wallace, the Government is
 22 proposing a change, a backing off from what the CAFC did,
 23 but proposing some new formulation or test. How does the
 24 test you propose differ from that proposed by the
 25 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers do you

24 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 think? 
 2 MR. WALLACE: Well, I think they take -- they
 3 start from what --
 4 QUESTION: They -- they key it into
 5 foreseeability somehow. 
 6 MR. WALLACE: Yes, but they start by assuming
 7 the validity of the flexible bar rule and trying to
 8 tighten it a little bit. We think that the court of
 9 appeals was right. 
 10 QUESTION: And so do you apparently. 
 11 MR. WALLACE: Well, we -- we think the court of
 12 appeals was right in saying that the way the -- it has
 13 been applying the flexible bar rule did not properly
 14 recognize what had been surrendered in the course of the
 15 prosecution history estoppel. But we -- we come out in
 16 much the same place at the end even though the differences
 17 between those and the Federal Bar Association also
 18 recommends a presumption and shift of the burden of proof
 19 similar to ours, but they're -- they're unwilling to
 20 recognize that everything, as the Court said in Exhibit
 21 Supply, that was surrendered is necessarily part of the
 22 implied disclaimer. They say, well, even if you went down
 23 to your 9 pH in Warner-Jenkinson, as long as you could
 24 show that you could have claimed 10, we should treat that
 25 the same as if you did claim 10. We think that the

25 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 inferences to be drawn by the public from the prosecution
 2 history estoppel are not that loose. 
 3 But we do think the court of appeals went too
 4 far in saying that applicants were on notice that an
 5 absolute bar would necessarily apply to all claims, and we
 6 have made our suggestions about burden of proof and
 7 presumptions to afford further protection in cases where
 8 the applicant -- the patentholder can show that it would
 9 be unfair to treat --
 10 QUESTION: Mr. Wallace, with respect to that,
 11 your second possibility, the second kind of escape hatch
 12 for the patentholder, as I understand it, relates to a
 13 case in which, in effect, it was impossible to be any more
 14 precise, to exclude any more precisely than they did. My
 15 question is, doesn't that in effect invite the
 16 patentholder to make that kind of a claim in every case? 
 17 And if that is, in fact, going to be an exception to
 18 absolute bar, doesn't it mean that we're going to litigate
 19 it in every case?
 20 MR. WALLACE: Well, we're quite worried about
 21 that. We caution that the versatility of language
 22 requires skepticism about that, but we -- we were also
 23 sensitive about the difficulties in some particular areas
 24 of new technology, biotechnology, and the like, although I
 25 pressed the Patent Office and they couldn't come up with a

26 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 concrete example. 
 2 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Wallace. 
 3 Mr. Neustadt, we'll hear from you.
 4 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR I. NEUSTADT
 5 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
 6 MR. NEUSTADT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 7 please the Court:
 8 First, I'd like to direct a response to Justice
 9 Breyer's question concerning that section of the statute
 10 that -- that you were looking for. That's 112, paragraph
 11 6, which says that you can claim the function of an
 12 element and you get protection for everything that has
 13 that function if it is the same as what's in the
 14 specification or its equivalent. 
 15 Next, I'd like to address my attention to
 16 Justice Stevenson's question with respect to literal
 17 infringement and doctrine of equivalents infringement. We
 18 were faced with the same question and we made an analysis
 19 of all the cases that were decided by the Federal circuit
 20 in the year 2000. We found that there were 31 cases that
 21 either held for the patentee or indicated they were going
 22 to hold for the patentee with respect to preliminary
 23 injunction. With respect to those cases, all but four
 24 were literal infringement. So, the answer to your
 25 question, for the year 2000, is that 27 of the 31 cases

27 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 were directed to literal infringement and not -- not
 2 doctrine of equivalents infringement. 
 3 And you must keep in mind that the Federal
 4 circuit in this case, with respect to the doctrine of
 5 equivalents, didn't rule on the doctrine of equivalents in
 6 general. They only ruled on the doctrine of equivalents
 7 with respect to when a patentee switches from one position
 8 to another. He starts with one claim. For some reason he
 9 sees that in order to get his patent, he is going to have
 10 to narrow. 
 11 A good example is the example that Festo uses,
 12 going from adhesives to glue. You claim adhesives broadly
 13 when you start. You're going to get protection for all
 14 adhesives. Then you find there's prior art or something
 15 else, maybe your specification isn't enabled, and you say
 16 I'm going to have to go to glue. 
 17 What the Federal circuit says for that
 18 particular claim element, when you go from adhesives to
 19 glue, you are telling the public that you're going to
 20 rely --
 21 QUESTION: But may I just interrupt with this --
 22 MR. NEUSTADT: Yes. 
 23 QUESTION: -- this observation? But -- but the
 24 result of your rule is that if you do make that change and
 25 go to -- to glue, you lose the doctrine of equivalents

28 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 with respect to that element, but someone who originally
 2 framed the claim in the way that you ended up with does
 3 not have the same opportunity to rely on equivalents that
 4 you do. Would you comment on that? 
 5 MR. NEUSTADT: That is correct. 
 6 This was a point that this Court addressed in
 7 Exhibit Supply and that is because claims are not
 8 interpreted just as they stand. They're interpreted in
 9 accordance with their prosecution history. Where you have
 10 an original claim that has no prosecution history, then
 11 it's much tougher for the public to read and figure out
 12 what -- what glue or adhesives mean. But where you have
 13 this change from one position to another, a change that
 14 every patent attorney resists, then the Federal circuit
 15 says this is a narrowing that the public is entitled to
 16 rely upon. So, there -- there is a very significant
 17 change even though you have the exact same words. 
 18 To refer to Mr. Breyer's question about whether
 19 or not the Federal circuit has the power to change what
 20 they've done, the answer is, of course, prosecution
 21 history estoppel is judge-made law. There is no statute
 22 concerning it. 
 23 QUESTION: This is scarcely an encouraging view.
 24 (Laughter.) 
 25 QUESTION: I mean, if -- if we're looking for

29 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 some sort of certainty in the area, to say that the
 2 Federal circuit has now come up with a relatively new
 3 doctrine but they're free to change it if it doesn't work
 4 is not the most auspicious recommendation for that
 5 doctrine.
 6 (Laughter.) 
 7 QUESTION: I presume it would be changed
 8 retroactively, just as it was introduced retroactively.
 9 MR. NEUSTADT: Well, I don't -- I don't think
 10 it's going to be changed, and I don't think there's
 11 anything retroactive because the Federal circuit decision
 12 was entirely consistent with this Court's precedent in
 13 Exhibit Supply and also Warner-Jenkinson. In Exhibit
 14 Supply, this Court said that where a patentee makes a
 15 change to avoid prior art for that particular element, he
 16 disclaims and abandons everything between --
 17 QUESTION: But the Federal circuit went further
 18 than that here. It doesn't have to be a change just to
 19 avoid prior art, does it? 
 20 MR. NEUSTADT: That is correct, Your Honor. But
 21 what they did was follow what this Court said in Warner-
 22 Jenkinson concerning what relates to patentability. The
 23 Court in Warner-Jenkinson said -- this Court -- that --
 24 that we have used this with respect to prior art, citing
 25 Exhibit Supply, but they didn't say it is limited to prior

30 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 art. What the Federal circuit then said --
 2 QUESTION: But in -- in the John Deere case,
 3 certainly the term patentability was used just for that
 4 purpose. 
 5 MR. NEUSTADT: For prior art? 
 6 QUESTION: Yes. 
 7 MR. NEUSTADT: I'm not sure, Your Honor. 
 8 What the Federal circuit did was they said --
 9 and there was almost virtually unanimity on the court, 11
 10 to 1 -- that when you make this narrowing for a purpose
 11 related to patentability or for a statutory requirement
 12 for patentability, then the public can view that and
 13 recognize and rely upon it. So, the extension from, if
 14 you will, 102 and 103 to 112 was of very little extension
 15 at all. 
 16 QUESTION: Well, are you using the term
 17 patentability to include 112? 
 18 MR. NEUSTADT: Yes. 
 19 QUESTION: I mean, that's part of the problem
 20 here. 
 21 MR. NEUSTADT: Yes, yes. 
 22 QUESTION: Well, I -- I think that's one of the
 23 issues in this case. 
 24 MR. NEUSTADT: Well, 112 is not just a matter of
 25 form. 112 is addressed to some of the most important

31 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 issues for a patent application, such as whether or not
 2 the application enables the invention. The quid pro quo
 3 for the public with respect to giving the exclusivity to
 4 the patentee is they get an enabling disclosure. If there
 5 is no enabling disclosure, then the public gets nothing. 
 6 Enabling disclosure is 112, so 112 is just not form. 
 7 If you are talking about form and clarification,
 8 usually when you clarify a claim, you don't narrow it and
 9 so the result is that would not be controlled by the
 10 Federal circuit rule. 
 11 What the Federal circuit --
 12 QUESTION: Well, is -- is that really so? I
 13 mean, every time you have a vague claim, you at least have
 14 an opportunity to say, well, it covers more than a
 15 contrasting narrow claim would be. So, I'm not sure that
 16 you can draw this categorical distinction. 
 17 MR. NEUSTADT: Usually when a patent attorney
 18 wants to -- is concerned with narrowing his claim, he
 19 doesn't want to narrow his claim because he gets less for
 20 his client. He will try to clarify it in a way that
 21 doesn't narrow, if that is the examiner's concern. So,
 22 usually clarifications are not narrowings and are not
 23 affected by the Federal circuit rule.
 24 What the Federal circuit issue is -- is directed
 25 to is actually changing a position for a statutory

32 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 requirement for patentability. That can be prior art. It
 2 can be non-enabling disclosure. For example, this Court
 3 has held in Crawford v. Heysinger in the 1800's -- applied
 4 prosecution history estoppel to a inoperability rejection
 5 which was a 112 rejection. And so, this is the reason why
 6 the Federal circuit had very little difficulty and ended
 7 up with an 11-to-1 vote when they said that, yes,
 8 amendments are not limited to avoid prior art. They cover
 9 other instances where you narrow. 
 10 And the key -- the key is narrowing. Patent
 11 attorneys hate to narrow. It gives their clients less
 12 protection. They don't want to narrow unless the only
 13 choice is not getting a patent. So, they put that
 14 narrowing language in there. And all that the Federal
 15 circuit is saying when they put that narrowing language in
 16 there, they should be held to it. And the reason they're
 17 held to it is because of the public --
 18 QUESTION: Well, they're saying more than that. 
 19 They're saying they're held to it for the entire element,
 20 and that's where I have -- have great problems with --
 21 with what the circuit does. And -- and it seems to me a
 22 vast extension over what we thought about in Warner-
 23 Jenkinson. 
 24 MR. NEUSTADT: In -- in Warner-Jenkinson this
 25 Court said that if we do not know the reason for the

33 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 amendment, we're going to presume that it relates to
 2 patentability, and when we make that presumption, if it's
 3 not rebutted, it will act as a bar. So, this Court in
 4 Warner-Jenkinson set forth a complete bar. Complete bar
 5 is nothing new. 
 6 QUESTION: Well, why isn't that enough? Why --
 7 why is an additional rule sought? 
 8 MR. NEUSTADT: The -- the additional rule
 9 relates to the fact that in the Federal circuit, not in
 10 this Court, there was what was called a flexible bar rule,
 11 and what they did was if you initially claimed glue and
 12 came back to adhesives and then -- I'm sorry -- you
 13 claimed adhesives and then you had to narrow it to glue,
 14 then in a lawsuit you found someone using adhesives, you
 15 would then say, well, my glue is really the same as
 16 adhesives under the doctrine of equivalents. And the
 17 Federal circuit in this decision is saying that you can't
 18 do that. 
 19 But previously the Federal circuit had the
 20 flexible bar rule, and the flexible bar rule said that if
 21 you went from adhesives to glue, and you didn't have to go
 22 all that way to glue -- maybe you could have stopped
 23 somewhere in between -- they say you can then look at
 24 where you might have been able to stop. This is in the
 25 Intel brief, could have, should have, and would have. And

34 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 they say we can take it back to something in between
 2 adhesives and glue. And the problem with that is that the
 3 public has no notice of what the claim covers. Someone
 4 out there who wants to innovate in the area between glue
 5 and adhesives has to know what he can do, and the Federal
 6 circuit rule enables them now to say that, yes, that claim
 7 means glue and we don't have to worry about something if
 8 we don't use glue. And --
 9 QUESTION: How would the SG's test apply to
 10 that, do you think? 
 11 MR. NEUSTADT: The -- the SG's test and also the
 12 IEEE test that you referred to -- the SE says -- and his
 13 -- his rule is a little better than the flexible bar rule.
 14 The SG says we're going to have a complete bar
 15 presumption, and the presumption is going to have to be
 16 overcome by the patentee, and he's going to have to show
 17 that this was unforeseeable. But this rule has all of the
 18 uncertainties that create all the problems with the
 19 flexible bar rule, and therefore it really is not an
 20 improvement. 
 21 The court's decision has been in effect for 13
 22 months. It's really worked just fine. There have been
 23 really no problems. Patent prosecution hasn't changed at
 24 all. There haven't been any cases that follow that --
 25 QUESTION: Can you give me -- can you give me

35 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 some sense as to how often patent applications are
 2 amended?
 3 MR. NEUSTADT: I don't think there are any
 4 statistics. Patent applications -- I'd say 50 percent,
 5 maybe more. But -- but that doesn't distinguish between
 6 amendments and narrowing amendments. Usually it's the
 7 narrowing amendments that -- that trigger the Federal
 8 circuit rule. 
 9 And with respect to --
 10 QUESTION: Because Mr. Bork says you're just
 11 going to transfer now the load to the appeals within the
 12 Patent Office and we're going to have this long, long
 13 running time. 
 14 MR. NEUSTADT: No. 
 15 QUESTION: And it seems to me that that --
 16 that's a -- a very serious consequence if -- if it in fact
 17 will follow. 
 18 MR. NEUSTADT: We haven't notice that
 19 consequence and that just isn't happening in the PTO. You
 20 see nothing in the SG PTO brief.
 21 QUESTION: Well, maybe everybody is waiting for
 22 this case. 
 23 (Laughter.) 
 24 MR. NEUSTADT: The -- that may be but the
 25 Federal circuit has -- has been applying this case in all

36 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 of its cases. It's simplified a lot of the decisions. 
 2 What it's meant is that patent attorneys can now advise
 3 their clients that, yes, you can do this; no, you can't do
 4 that. Whereas, under the flexible bar rule, they were
 5 unable to do so.
 6 In -- in -- when you claim, the claiming is
 7 central to -- to the system -- to our system. The
 8 applicant has a disclosure. From that disclosure, he can
 9 decide what it is he wants to claim, and he can claim
 10 various elements and he usually does it as broadly as
 11 possible. The examiner then examines the claim on exactly
 12 what he claims, not the disclosure. The patentee is
 13 master of his claims. He decides what the issue is going
 14 to be. 
 15 If the examiner rejects the claim that was
 16 selected by the patentee, then -- then the patentee or the
 17 applicant says, well, there's nothing I can do now. I
 18 either have a choice of not getting a patent or I've got
 19 to limit my patent. So, he comes in and he limits his
 20 patent. He goes from adhesives to glue. 
 21 That patent issues and the public can then look
 22 at it. The patent tells you what you can't do, but more
 23 importantly, it tells you what you can do. And the public
 24 can do no better than look at the claim and its
 25 prosecution history, and when it does that, it can look

37 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 and decide what it can do. And this results in increased
 2 innovation. 
 3 This Court in Markman, interpreting claims, said
 4 that claims, if they are uncertain -- and this was the
 5 need for judges rather than juries to interpret them. If
 6 they're uncertain, they foreclose an area of technology. 
 7 If you have uncertainty between here and here, no one will
 8 innovate in that area because they recognize, if they're
 9 successful, they're just going to be sued for infringement
 10 under the doctrine of equivalents. They may have an
 11 injunction entered against them, which is going to stop
 12 their production line, and they're going to have to give
 13 back profits which the patentee is going to ask for in
 14 lost profits. 
 15 So, everything really turns on the claims, and
 16 the patent attorney has the tools to do it. He can use
 17 112, paragraph 6. He always claims as broadly as
 18 possible. 
 19 All that the Federal circuit has --
 20 QUESTION: The argument you're now making is a
 21 wonderful argument against the whole doctrine of
 22 equivalents, which I thought we had rejected. 
 23 MR. NEUSTADT: The difference -- the difference
 24 between that is that the Federal circuit has limited its
 25 holding to the time when the patent applicant goes from

38 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 one claim to another claim where he narrows the claim. If
 2 he doesn't narrow the claim, there's no problem with the
 3 doctrine of equivalents. Also, if he doesn't narrow an
 4 element, there's no doctrine of equivalents. 
 5 All that the Federal circuit has said here is
 6 that the balance shifts with respect to the point that
 7 you're referring to when the patent applicant, with his
 8 eyes open, knows that he's got a problem and he's going to
 9 have to narrow.
 10 QUESTION: Well, that may well be. But -- but
 11 if -- if the considerations that you're raising now are as
 12 forceful as you think they are, we should simply abolish
 13 the doctrine of equivalents. That -- that would give
 14 great certainty to the patent law, and all of the -- all
 15 of the things that you assert would be achieved. The
 16 patentee is on notice and he should be as precise as
 17 possible, blah, blah, blah. 
 18 MR. NEUSTADT: Well, that's not an issue before
 19 the Court. But the -- the Federal circuit does restrict
 20 the doctrine in -- doctrine of equivalents in other areas. 
 21 For example, you can have an argument that you make in
 22 your -- in your amendment, and that argument can then be
 23 used against you as an estoppel. That's not an issue in
 24 this case. 
 25 The Federal circuit also handled an issue where

39 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 an applicant will disclose, say, three things, A, B, and
 2 C, and he'll only claim A. And then he'll come back and
 3 he'll say, under the doctrine of equivalents, A covers B
 4 and C. And the Federal circuit deals with that. But
 5 that's not an issue in this case. 
 6 What the Federal circuit has done is they've
 7 handled the exact issue that this Court handled in Exhibit
 8 Supply and in Warner-Jenkinson. And that is that the
 9 balance shifts when you make an amendment that relates to
 10 patentability and --
 11 QUESTION: Mr. Neustadt, would you -- would you
 12 tell us why the approach of a complete bar is consistent
 13 with the approach taken in Warner-Jenkinson where the
 14 Court did not want to have a rigid -- a rule with no
 15 flexibility, and so it created this rebuttable
 16 presumption?
 17 MR. NEUSTADT: Yes. The Court in Warner-
 18 Jenkinson was trying to decide between amendments that
 19 relate to patentability and amendments that do not relate
 20 to patentability. And the petitioner in that case was
 21 asserting that that distinction was not an important
 22 distinction. The Court in Warner-Jenkinson said we're not
 23 going to have a bright line rule that this complete bar is
 24 going to apply to every single amendment. It's only going
 25 to apply to those amendments that relate to patentability. 

40 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 And the Court said in the past we've used prior art as
 2 relating to patentability, but the Court did not limit it
 3 to that. 
 4 The Federal circuit then came back and one of
 5 the questions they had, they said, is 102 and -- is
 6 relates to patentability under this Court's decision
 7 limited to 102 and 103. And this is question one in the
 8 Federal circuit. And the Federal circuit held virtually
 9 unanimous, 11 to 1, that relates to patentability is not
 10 limited to 102 and 103. 
 11 QUESTION: But that's simply an interpretation
 12 of our cases. Or it should have been at any rate. And I
 13 dare say we're in a better position to interpret our cases
 14 than the Federal circuit. 
 15 MR. NEUSTADT: Well, I think the -- the Federal
 16 circuit was saying that the cases of this Court were not
 17 absolutely controlling, but what they would do would be
 18 consistent with this Court. And that was -- that was the
 19 effect of their holding. 
 20 But if you look carefully -- look more carefully
 21 at this Court's cases, this Court's cases we submit in our
 22 brief actually do control and would have necessitated the
 23 Federal circuit to reach that verdict. This Court, as I
 24 said --
 25 QUESTION: Well, there is an -- I think I agree

41 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 with Justice Ginsburg, as she suggested. I think there is
 2 an inconsistency between Warner-Jenkinson and the position
 3 you're taking. 
 4 MR. NEUSTADT: An inconsistency? 
 5 QUESTION: Yes. 
 6 MR. NEUSTADT: I don't think so because the --
 7 the --
 8 QUESTION: Well, the remand in Warner-Jenkinson.
 9 MR. NEUSTADT: Yes. The remand in Warner-
 10 Jenkinson, as specifically defined there, was for the
 11 Federal circuit to determine whether or not the amendment
 12 that was made to change the pH to 6 related to
 13 patentability. The petitioner was saying you don't have
 14 to determine whether it relates to patentability. The
 15 remand said, Federal circuit, you now look and tell us
 16 whether or not it relates to patentability, and that's
 17 what the Federal circuit did. 
 18 And then as they had a few more cases after
 19 Warner-Jenkinson -- and they had -- they had disputes
 20 among the judges -- they said we're going to resolve this
 21 in this -- in this case. And they not only said they're
 22 going to rehear it en banc, but they said we're going to
 23 have five questions. And the first question was -- was
 24 Justice Ginsburg's question. 
 25 QUESTION: But I didn't mean it to be. I meant

42 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 to focus you on the second question which you say is the
 2 more important of the two, and --
 3 MR. NEUSTADT: The complete bar, yes.
 4 QUESTION: -- and just saying that in Warner-
 5 Jenkinson, the Court didn't want to freeze things, so it
 6 had this rebuttable presumption. You do want to, when you
 7 get to your question two, say absolute bar. 
 8 MR. NEUSTADT: The absolute bar was in Warner-
 9 Jenkinson. In Warner-Jenkinson, this Court said if the
 10 amendment relates to patentability, then there's going to
 11 be an absolute bar. The words this Court used was bar.
 12 They didn't use absolute bar because a bar is a bar. But
 13 -- but -- and this Court was just following Exhibit Supply
 14 which had that same bar in that. 
 15 QUESTION: Well, I thought everybody agreed that
 16 the question was open, that this Court did not decide.
 17 MR. NEUSTADT: The Federal circuit said that
 18 their decision was not controlled by Exhibit Supply. Both
 19 our side and the Government side said that it is
 20 controlled by Exhibit Supply and that the Federal circuit
 21 would have had to have reached that conclusion anyway. 
 22 And -- and the -- the very plain language of Exhibit
 23 Supply is that when a patentee chooses to go from the
 24 claim as unamended to make a narrow limitations in there,
 25 there's a complete bar with respect to the amended

43 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 element. And Exhibit Supply, of course, talks about there
 2 is an abandonment and disclaimer of everything between the
 3 element as unamended and as amended.
 4 And to --
 5 QUESTION: Could you explain to me a little more
 6 clearly what -- what you assert relates to patentability
 7 means? I mean, if -- if you narrow the phrase to mean it
 8 -- it relates only to prior art or to any impediment to
 9 getting the invention accepted as novel or whatever, I
 10 understand what it means. But if it -- if it includes any
 11 change that is made in order to get the examiner to accept
 12 the patent, then what change does not relate to
 13 patentability? If -- if, as you assert, patent attorneys
 14 are so reluctant to make any changes, what change would
 15 not relate to patentability? The only reason they're
 16 doing it is to get the patent. 
 17 MR. NEUSTADT: Yes. It's not changes. It's the
 18 narrowing changes. You can make a lot of changes. 
 19 QUESTION: Fine. What narrowing changes would
 20 not relate to patentability? 
 21 MR. NEUSTADT: There are very few changes where
 22 you have significant narrowing that do not relate to
 23 patentability. 
 24 QUESTION: I can't imagine any because why would
 25 you do it unless --

44 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. NEUSTADT: Oh, well --
 2 QUESTION: -- unless to get the examiner to
 3 accept -- to accept your patent?
 4 MR. NEUSTADT: If you take out narrowing, you
 5 can have a lot of changes. For example, you may file an
 6 application and then broaden your claim. 
 7 QUESTION: But -- but why -- why talk about
 8 changes that relate to patentability? Why not just say
 9 all narrowing changes? Let's make it clear what we're
 10 talking about. You're saying all narrowing changes. 
 11 MR. NEUSTADT: And this is why the Federal
 12 circuit had such virtual unanimity because --
 13 QUESTION: And -- and you think that that's --
 14 that's what we meant in -- in Warner-Jenkinson by -- by
 15 changes that relate to patentability. All narrowing
 16 changes. 
 17 MR. NEUSTADT: I think in Warner-Jenkinson the
 18 subject wasn't specifically addressed. The Court
 19 recognized that you have narrowing changes with respect to
 20 prior art. 
 21 QUESTION: It would be a very strange
 22 terminology to use to refer to all narrowing changes.
 23 MR. NEUSTADT: Yes. 
 24 QUESTION: You know, it doesn't seem to me
 25 synonymous with patentability. 

45 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. NEUSTADT: To -- to a certain extent, the --
 2 the Federal circuit rule is even narrower than -- than
 3 Warner-Jenkinson because this Court in Warner-Jenkinson
 4 did not refer to narrowing. It just referred to
 5 amendments that relate to prior art, and there must have
 6 been an implicit assumption that that was -- that was
 7 narrowing. 
 8 The Federal circuit, since they hear a lot of
 9 patent cases, focused more in on the fact that it really
 10 wasn't the fact that it was prior art. What you wanted to
 11 get at was important changes, and they -- they used the
 12 language statutory requirements of patentability. 
 13 For example, one of the most important things is
 14 your claim being supported by the disclosure. You can't
 15 claim what you don't invent. So, if your claim is real
 16 broad, the examiner says, but you've only disclosed this,
 17 so you can't foreclose all of this. And so then you have
 18 to narrow it down to this. And that's a 112 change, and a
 19 112 change is just as important as a 102 and a 103 change.
 20 And so the Federal circuit says if it's for a statutory
 21 requirement for patentability. And these are not trivial
 22 changes. 
 23 A patent attorney, when an examiner makes a
 24 change -- a suggested change, says, well, how can I do
 25 that without narrowing.

46 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 The same thing with respect to clarity. You can
 2 make changes with respect to clarity. Maybe the examiner
 3 likes 12 feet rather than 144 inches. Maybe there are
 4 other things that he thinks will be more clear. As long
 5 as they're not narrowing, the patent attorney is happy to
 6 make them, but as soon as he -- he narrows, he knows that
 7 he's getting his client less.
 8 With respect to foreseeability, I just wanted to
 9 make one comment. Patent attorneys, when they draft broad
 10 claims, they draft broad claims because they don't know
 11 what is going to happen in the future. They want the
 12 broad claim because if something happens in the future,
 13 they're going to be covered for it. Also, the patent
 14 attorney doesn't know everything that's happened in the
 15 past, and so he wants the broad claim because he gets much
 16 better coverage. 
 17 For example, you don't want to go to -- from
 18 adhesives to glue, because if you do that -- I'm sorry.
 19 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Neustadt.
 20 Mr. Bork, you have 2 minutes remaining.
 21 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK
 22 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 23 MR. BORK: I wish to address this question of
 24 narrowing. The concept of narrowing has no limits. In
 25 this case, the Stoll patent moved one element -- an

47 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 element from one claim to another. No change, just moved
 2 from one claim to another. That was held to be a
 3 narrowing. Now, if that's a narrowing, nothing is
 4 unrelated to patentability. That -- that's the extreme to
 5 which the Federal circuit takes this case. 
 6 Now, as far as the Government is concerned, the
 7 Government I think didn't quote you the relevant language
 8 from their brief. They approvingly quoted as the law in
 9 Warner-Jenkinson -- that is, in filing in Warner-Jenkinson
 10 -- whenever a prosecution history estoppel is invoked,
 11 there's a limitation to infringement under the doctrine of
 12 equivalents. A close examination must be made as to not
 13 only what was surrendered but also the reason for such
 14 surrender. That's the position that the -- this Court
 15 adopted in Warner-Jenkinson. It's the position that Festo
 16 takes before this Court today. 
 17 I should say that I don't -- when I answered
 18 you, Justice O'Connor, I did not mean to say that a
 19 limitation was the same as an amendment. It's just a
 20 statement of the claim. A limitation is where the claim
 21 is when you first make it. 
 22 This case -- if what happened to Festo here and
 23 what's going to happen to other patentholders continues,
 24 this case, were it not done by a court, were it done by
 25 any other agency, would be a taking under the

48 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 Constitution. And that's why it's important that you --
 2 this Court not approve a retroactive application of this
 3 drastic new rule but require that it be done by Congress
 4 or by rulemaking by the Patent and Trademark Office.
 5 Thank you. 
 6 QUESTION: May I ask, since you do have a second
 7 left, what -- what case of ours does -- other than Warner-
 8 Jenkinson, does the new rule repudiate?
 9 MR. BORK: Almost all of them. For example, the
 10 doctrine of equivalents goes back well into the last
 11 century. Winans against Denmead, 1853. There's an
 12 argument there about -- they don't call it the doctrine of
 13 equivalents then, but there's an argument there about
 14 whether something fell under a patent claim and they say
 15 that it's really the same thing, same principle as
 16 involved, and therefore --
 17 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Bork.
 18 The case is submitted. 
 19 (Whereupon, at 11:17 a.m., the case in the
 20 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
