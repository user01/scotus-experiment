 2 (10:04 a.m.)
 3 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
 4 now in Number 01-1184, United States versus Francisco
 5 Jimenez Recio and Mr. Lopez-Mesa. 
 6 Mr. Dreeben. 
 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 9 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 10 please the Court:
 11 This Court has made clear that conspiracy is an
 12 inchoate offense, the essence of which is the agreement to
 13 commit an unlawful act. 
 14 QUESTION: What does the word inchoate mean? I
 15 realize you're getting it from our opinions, but --
 16 (Laughter.) 
 17 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that
 18 it means an uncompleted offense, activities that have not
 19 yet progressed to the point of having violated a
 20 substantive provision of the criminal law, yet which
 21 represent a sufficient step to warrant legal intervention
 22 under the doctrine of either attempt or conspiracy.
 23 QUESTION: It's the opposite of a choate
 24 offense, I assume, is it not? 
 25 (Laughter.) 

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Scalia, except that
 2 word seems not to have appeared in this Court's opinions. 
 3 (Laughter.) 
 4 QUESTION: Or in the dictionary. 
 5 (Laughter.) 
 6 QUESTION: Well, it is in the dictionary. I'm
 7 getting it in a minute. It will take me a minute to
 8 noodle while I get it out of the dictionary. 
 9 But I -- I thought that it meant something
 10 that's not yet formed. 
 11 MR. DREEBEN: Well, in the case of a conspiracy,
 12 Justice Kennedy --
 13 QUESTION: I thought that's what the word meant.
 14 MR. DREEBEN: It -- it may -- it means that
 15 with --
 16 QUESTION: Incipient I suppose. 
 17 MR. DREEBEN: -- with -- right. With reference
 18 to the object offense. So a conspiracy is an agreement to
 19 commit an offense. The offense has not yet been formed. 
 20 It has not actually been realized, but the conspirators
 21 have agreed to commit the offense. 
 22 And the law of conspiracy deems it appropriate
 23 for society to intervene at the stage at which the
 24 conspirators have entered into that agreement so as to
 25 protect society against two things. 

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: And taken some act in furtherance of
 2 it? 
 3 MR. DREEBEN: Justice O'Connor, under the drug
 4 statute, this Court held in United States v. Shabani that
 5 there is no requirement of proof of an overt act in order
 6 to punish a drug conspiracy. 
 7 QUESTION: When does the conspiracy terminate,
 8 in your view? 
 9 MR. DREEBEN: The conspiracy terminates, Justice
 10 O'Connor, either when the conspirators achieve the
 11 objective that they have agreed to carry out, or when they
 12 have abandoned efforts to do so. That fundamentally
 13 reflects the principle that the essence --
 14 QUESTION: Or when one of them has abandoned
 15 efforts. I mean, if -- if one of them leaves the
 16 conspiracy, I suppose you have a different conspiracy
 17 then, or what? 
 18 MR. DREEBEN: No, not automatically, Justice
 19 Scalia. 
 20 QUESTION: Suppose one of them knows that it's
 21 no longer possible and he leaves the conspiracy.
 22 MR. DREEBEN: That individual will -- in order
 23 to accomplish a withdrawal from the conspiracy has to do
 24 more than simply leave it. The law of withdrawal of a --
 25 on withdrawal from a conspiracy requires that the

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 conspirator do some affirmative act to terminate the
 2 existence of the conspiracy either by going to law
 3 enforcement, or by communicating to his fellow
 4 conspirators that he's done with the venture and he's out
 5 of it.
 6 But the termination of the participation of one
 7 co-conspirator through withdrawal or abandonment or
 8 telling law enforcement does not terminate the conspiracy.
 9 The very nature of conspiracy is a group of individuals
 10 who have come together to carry out an unlawful act, and
 11 in order for the conspiracy to do that, it frequently will
 12 grow and enlarge its membership. Other members may drop
 13 out. But so long as there is a common agreement to commit
 14 a definable crime or unlawful act, the conspiracy
 15 continues.
 16 QUESTION: What if all but one drop out? Does
 17 a -- does a conspiracy continue as to that one? 
 18 MR. DREEBEN: Well, this Court has never
 19 addressed the question, and I could find no cases in the
 20 common law that had addressed the question. Certainly
 21 under the common law, you cannot have a unilateral
 22 conspiracy, although the Model Penal Code would have
 23 allowed that. 
 24 There may, however, be policy reasons to hold
 25 that once a conspirator has embarked upon his venture,

6
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 even if all of the other conspirators are arrested and
 2 give up the effort, that one lone conspirator who still
 3 soldiers on, without knowing that the other conspirators
 4 have abandoned it, might properly be held liable for
 5 seeking to accomplish the aims of the conspiracy. 
 6 QUESTION: It's a conspiracy of one, so to
 7 speak, right? 
 8 MR. DREEBEN: If such an animal exists, it would
 9 be a conspiracy in which all members but one have
 10 abandoned the objective. 
 11 In a case like this, however, where what happens
 12 is that two members of a multi-member conspiracy are
 13 arrested, one of them becomes a Government agent, the
 14 other one perhaps does not -- and it's not clear that he
 15 did abandon the efforts to accomplish the goals of the
 16 conspiracy -- but there are many others at large who are
 17 continuing to carry out the conspiracy, the criminal
 18 agreement persists. 
 19 And where the Ninth Circuit got off on the wrong
 20 foot was by believing that a conspiracy ends when its
 21 goals have been defeated. When the object of the
 22 conspiracy has been defeated, the Ninth Circuit thought,
 23 the conspiracy is over.
 24 That, however, is contradictory to the
 25 fundamental principle of conspiracy law that the essence

7
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 of the crime is the agreement between the parties to carry
 2 out an unlawful act, and to take the --
 3 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, what about --
 4 QUESTION: Would you -- would you tell me what
 5 the conspiracy was that survived the -- the claimed end of
 6 the conspiracy? What -- what -- conspiracy to do what? 
 7 MR. DREEBEN: Conspiracy to distribute and
 8 deliver marijuana and cocaine. 
 9 QUESTION: Was it the marijuana and cocaine that
 10 had already been seized by the Government, or some other
 11 marijuana? 
 12 MR. DREEBEN: As the case comes to this Court,
 13 the conspiracy that survived was the conspiracy to
 14 distribute that cocaine and marijuana that had been
 15 seized. 
 16 But what's crucial is that those conspirators
 17 who remained liable were entirely unaware that the
 18 Government had intervened and frustrated the objective of
 19 the conspiracy. 
 20 And I think that the hypothetical that makes
 21 clear why the Ninth Circuit went wrong is the instance
 22 where the Government enters the market in a reverse sting
 23 operation and goes into the market as a seller, offering
 24 to sell drugs, and a collective of individuals decides to
 25 pool their resources and arrange to purchase the drugs

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that the Government is offering. It is highly likely that
 2 the Government has no intention and never had any
 3 intention of delivering actual drugs. Therefore, the goal
 4 of the conspirators is frustrated at the inception. They
 5 don't know it, but they could never accomplish the object
 6 of their conspiracy. Yet, it's settled in the Ninth
 7 Circuit and elsewhere that the conspirators can still be
 8 held liable because their agreement to perform an act
 9 which, under the facts as they understand them, would be
 10 unlawful. 
 11 QUESTION: And the difference between an attempt
 12 and the conspiracy, in the attempt you need a dangerous
 13 probability of success or something along that line, but
 14 you don't need that in a conspiracy case. 
 15 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct. Conspiracy
 16 intervenes at an earlier stage, Justice Stevens. The
 17 traditional Federal rule is that in an attempt, you need
 18 the intent to perform the illegal act, plus a substantial
 19 step towards its completion. The law of attempt has
 20 always required a little bit more activity on the part of
 21 the defendant before the Government can intervene and
 22 penalize it. And that's in part because of the need to
 23 have some corroborating evidence that the defendant
 24 actually did intend to carry out an illegal act and to
 25 avoid penalizing something as a thought crime.

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, the first trial in this
 2 case described a narrower conspiracy, did it not, than was
 3 involved in the second trial? And would you explain what
 4 the difference was in the conspiracy charge initially
 5 made, and the conspiracy charge in the second trial? 
 6 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the conspiracy charge,
 7 Justice Ginsburg, remained the same in both. In the --
 8 the indictment was not changed. It was a single
 9 indictment that alleged the conspirators formed an
 10 agreement at a date unknown to the grand jury, but by
 11 November 18th, 1997, to distribute and possess with intent
 12 to distribute cocaine and marijuana. 
 13 In the original trial, the parties were unaware
 14 of the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States versus
 15 Cruz, which forms the basis for the legal rule that the
 16 Government challenges here. And it, therefore, proceeded
 17 on the -- what we believe to be the wholly correct theory
 18 that respondents could be held liable for joining that
 19 conspiracy on November 19th when they agreed to become
 20 couriers to move the drugs further down the road in Idaho. 
 21 They did not know that the drugs had actually been seized
 22 earlier by the Government and that the Government was
 23 watching them. So the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Cruz
 24 meant that what the Government had argued in the first
 25 case no longer was sufficient to support conspiracy

10
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 liability.
 2 QUESTION: Is -- is there a temporal component
 3 to your argument? If the initial defendants had been
 4 arrested and detained for a month and then they got around
 5 to the sting operation, would it still be a conspiracy, or
 6 does it lapse after some reasonable time? 
 7 MR. DREEBEN: It doesn't lapse through a period
 8 of time, Justice Kennedy. What could cause the conspiracy
 9 to end is the conspirators' wholly abandoning pursuit of
 10 the objectives of the conspiracy. In other words, if all
 11 of the conspirators on the outside -- those who were in
 12 Arizona on the sending end and those who were on Idaho on
 13 the delivery end -- had all concluded that something has
 14 gone wrong with this shipment, the drugs have disappeared,
 15 they could have abandoned the narrowest version of the
 16 conspiracy --
 17 QUESTION: But so long as one of the end
 18 delivery people didn't know about it and thought that the
 19 drugs were still on the way, he could continue to recruit
 20 people and so forth even if the principals had been in
 21 jail for a month and the drugs had been seized for a
 22 month?
 23 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the people who were in jail
 24 were the couriers, not the principals. 
 25 QUESTION: Well, let's -- let's -- all right. 

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 But even those -- some couriers had -- had been in jail. 
 2 MR. DREEBEN: Correct, because so long as those
 3 individuals who are involved in the conspiracy are still
 4 trying to accomplish its objective, the conspiracy is
 5 still alive. And as the -- as in the case of the
 6 Government sting where there's never any drugs in the
 7 outset, the conspiracy is impossible as a matter of fact
 8 for the conspirators to successfully accomplish. But if
 9 it is accepted that that can be a crime, where there's a
 10 Government sting at the outset, then surely the
 11 Government's intervention in midstream doesn't
 12 automatically terminate the conspiracy as a matter of law,
 13 which is what the Ninth Circuit held. 
 14 QUESTION: Mr. --
 15 QUESTION: But explain again what you mean now? 
 16 If, instead of cocaine, it had been powdered sugar, can
 17 there be a conspiracy conviction? 
 18 MR. DREEBEN: Justice O'Connor, it would depend
 19 on whether the powdered sugar is supplied by the
 20 Government under the representation that it is cocaine, or
 21 whether the defendants are actually seeking to move
 22 powdered sugar knowing that they are seeking to move
 23 powdered sugar. 
 24 QUESTION: No. They think they're -- they have
 25 a load of cocaine and that was their intent, but

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 unbeknownst to them, it's powdered sugar. 
 2 MR. DREEBEN: Liability. Because the -- the
 3 question of conspiracy liability is judged by what the
 4 actor perceives to be the facts. 
 5 QUESTION: How is that different from an
 6 agreement to receive stolen goods and then we find out
 7 the -- goods are not stolen? That's -- that's not
 8 actionable I -- I had thought. 
 9 MR. DREEBEN: Well, it is the same, Justice
 10 Kennedy, and -- and the uniform position in the Federal
 11 courts is that it is. That would be a mistake of fact,
 12 and when the conspirators or the person who's attempting
 13 to commit a crime has the intent to commit a crime and
 14 takes a substantial step for it, the fact that unbeknownst
 15 to him some aspect of the universe is such that he can't
 16 complete the crime does not defeat the accomplishment of
 17 the objective. 
 18 QUESTION: Well, if -- for a conspiracy
 19 conviction, I mean, because the whole -- the whole purpose
 20 is to prevent people banding together for wicked purposes,
 21 but if -- if there's no conspiracy involved and he's
 22 mistaken in the fact, I assume there's no crime. 
 23 MR. DREEBEN: No. The -- the modern rule,
 24 Justice Scalia, is that there is a crime. In this
 25 country, the earliest case that addressed it and the case

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that all of us are familiar with from law school is People
 2 versus Jaffe, a New York Court of Appeals case from 1906. 
 3 And that case did, indeed, hold -- as Justice Kennedy has
 4 described it -- that if the person is receiving what he
 5 believes to be stolen goods and the goods are not stolen,
 6 he is not liable. 
 7 But the modern focus on attempt law is on the
 8 intent of the actor to commit an illegal act, and the fact
 9 that unbeknownst to him there are circumstances that
 10 prevent him from accomplishing the completed crime does
 11 not defeat his liability for an attempt. 
 12 In other words, attempt law and conspiracy law
 13 have, to an extent, converged on the policy that the
 14 importance of inchoate crimes is to get at dangerous
 15 actors. 
 16 QUESTION: What case would you cite to us for
 17 this notion under attempt law? Is -- is there anything
 18 from this Court? 
 19 MR. DREEBEN: There -- the only thing that there
 20 is from this Court, Justice O'Connor, are two opinions
 21 that have addressed the obstruction of justice statute,
 22 Osborn versus United States and United States versus
 23 Aguilar. In both of those cases, the Court was dealing
 24 with a statute that didn't use the word attempt. It used
 25 the word endeavor. And the Court made quite clear that

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the impossibility of the defendant accomplishing the
 2 objective of his crime doesn't defeat liability. 
 3 In Osborn, it was an individual who was
 4 attempting to bribe a juror. Unbeknownst to him, the
 5 intermediary, who he was using to pay the bribe, was
 6 working with the FBI. And of course, the bribe was not
 7 going to be paid. The juror was not going to be
 8 corrupted. And yet, the Court held that an endeavor to
 9 commit the crime is punishable.
 10 QUESTION: Does the Model -- Model Penal Code
 11 take a position on this? 
 12 MR. DREEBEN: Yes. The Model Penal Code goes
 13 very far in the direction of the intent-based focus of
 14 attempt law and conspiracy law. In the Model Penal Code,
 15 there is no defense for impossibility of any kind, fact or
 16 law. 
 17 What the Model Penal Code does, however, is
 18 allow, in certain extreme cases that it wasn't able to
 19 craft a principle for, a power to a judge to either reduce
 20 the grade of a crime or to dismiss it. 
 21 And the Model Penal Code was thinking about
 22 hypotheticals which have not come up in any cases that --
 23 that anyone has actually found, such as where an
 24 individual believes that he can kill through incantations
 25 and voodoo and sets about to do so. Under an orthodox,

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 doctrinaire approach to principles of attempt law, that
 2 individual has the intent to kill, and has carried out a
 3 substantial step. Many commentators have said that should
 4 not occasion liability because it's inherently impossible
 5 that the actor will achieve his goal and in reality that
 6 person is probably not a dangerous individual who warrants
 7 punishment. 
 8 QUESTION: Well, what -- what's the difference
 9 between being inherently impossible and the other kinds of
 10 impossibility? 
 11 MR. DREEBEN: Only a matter of degree, Mr. Chief
 12 Justice, and for that reason, the Model Penal Code
 13 rejected a legal rule that would carve out inherent
 14 impossibility and said that it's really something that
 15 should go to whether a judge should reduce the grade of a
 16 crime or dismiss it. 
 17 Our position is that that sort of --
 18 QUESTION: Okay -- or dismiss it. They -- they
 19 just leave it up to the judge? It's a crime or not
 20 depending upon -- is there any other instance where the
 21 Model Penal Code does this sort of thing? 
 22 MR. DREEBEN: I don't know if there are any
 23 other instances where the Model Penal Code does it, but
 24 our position is that the sounder approach is to --
 25 QUESTION: Extraordinary.

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DREEBEN: -- leave those cases in the hands
 2 of prosecutorial discretion and the common sense of
 3 juries. The fact is that there really are no
 4 hypotheticals in real cases that resemble the killer by
 5 incantation. 
 6 QUESTION: What did the Ninth Circuit rely on in
 7 United States versus Cruz? If -- if the law is as uniform
 8 as you say it is, what -- what did they rely on? They
 9 must have relied on something. 
 10 MR. DREEBEN: The Ninth Circuit, I believe, made
 11 a -- a linguistic mistake. There are an abundance of
 12 cases that say that a conspiracy ends when its goal is
 13 either accomplished or defeated, and those cases, read in
 14 context, mean that if the conspirators actually abandon
 15 their efforts to complete the crime, or all of them are
 16 arrested and they're in custody and they're really not in
 17 a position to go forward anymore, the conspiracy ends at
 18 that point. 
 19 And frequently that sort of a determination is
 20 made for purposes of the admission of co-conspirator
 21 statements under 801(d)(2)(E). You want to know whether
 22 the conspiracy is alive so you can determine whether to
 23 admit post-arrest statements by one conspirator against
 24 another conspirator. And in those cases, it makes perfect
 25 sense to say that the conspiracy ended when all of the

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 co-conspirators are arrested and have given up. 
 2 The Ninth Circuit took that language -- the
 3 language referring to the defeat of the object of the
 4 conspiracy -- and took it literally, and the effect was to
 5 create a defense of factual impossibility. And the court
 6 actually used those words. It was factually impossible
 7 for the conspirators to complete their crime. Therefore,
 8 the conspiracy was over as a matter of law. 
 9 QUESTION: Is it the case -- four conspirators,
 10 A, B, C, D. A is arrested, out on bail. A makes a few
 11 statements which are overheard. Can you admit that
 12 hearsay against B, C, D, who are later found?
 13 MR. DREEBEN: It all depends, Justice Breyer, on
 14 whether --
 15 QUESTION: I thought they couldn't. 
 16 MR. DREEBEN: -- on whether he's still
 17 attempting to achieve the goal of the conspiracy. There
 18 are a -- a number --
 19 QUESTION: You say, would -- in that --
 20 normally -- normally a person who's arrested, that ends
 21 the conspiracy as to that person, doesn't it, at least
 22 normally? 
 23 MR. DREEBEN: Well, not -- not necessarily,
 24 Justice Breyer. In this case, for example, one of the two
 25 arrested couriers, Sotelo, reportedly told Arce, the other

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 arrested co-conspirator, that they should both tell a lie
 2 to the authorities and then try to escape. I mean,
 3 that --
 4 QUESTION: No, I'm not thinking of that. I'm
 5 thinking it is an -- there -- there is no reason to
 6 think -- all we know about him is he's arrested and he
 7 happens to mention something to a neighbor that has
 8 nothing to do -- who has nothing to do with the
 9 conspiracy. This statement is not made in furtherance of
 10 any conspiracy.
 11 MR. DREEBEN: Correct. 
 12 QUESTION: It's simply made after A is arrested. 
 13 As far as we know, A has nothing further to do with it.
 14 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct. So long as the
 15 statement isn't made in furtherance --
 16 QUESTION: But -- that shows -- in other words,
 17 that shows what? That shows that although the conspiracy
 18 in your view continues -- B, C, D -- but A has withdrawn? 
 19 Is that what it shows? 
 20 MR. DREEBEN: No. What it may show is that the
 21 statement wasn't made in furtherance of the conspiracy. 
 22 If he's simply talking to his neighbor, it may not be
 23 doing anything to carry out the aims of the conspiracy. 
 24 If, on the other hand --
 25 QUESTION: Inadmissible, in other words, even if

19
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 A has never been arrested? 
 2 MR. DREEBEN: Right. The statement to be
 3 admitted as a statement of a co-conspirator must be both
 4 during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. 
 5 So to continue your hypothetical, if you suppose that
 6 A comes out, and then tries to communicate through
 7 intermediaries that he knows where the drugs are and that
 8 people should take efforts to secrete them before the
 9 authorities seize them, then that statement could be
 10 admitted as a co-conspirator's declaration.
 11 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, could we just clarify
 12 this particular case? Why the -- the date of the 18th
 13 when the two people involved -- the proof as to them goes
 14 only from the next day on? And why the -- their
 15 conspiracy starts the day that the drugs are seized. 
 16 Right?
 17 MR. DREEBEN: Correct. 
 18 QUESTION: Although the larger conspiracy that
 19 they're part of began presumably much before that. 
 20 MR. DREEBEN: Actually, I -- I think the -- the
 21 way the case comes to this Court, the involvement of the
 22 two couriers begins on November 19th, the day after the
 23 drugs are seized, when they're recruited.
 24 QUESTION: Yes, but they're charged with a
 25 conspiracy dating from the 18th. Is that right? 

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DREEBEN: That's right. That's right. 
 2 QUESTION: Although they don't enter the picture
 3 until the 19th. 
 4 MR. DREEBEN: As the case comes to this Court,
 5 that's right. When -- when the case was charged, the
 6 parties weren't focusing on Cruz and the case was just
 7 charged in the way conspiracies normally are; namely, the
 8 grand jury alleges that the conspiracy came into existence
 9 by a particular date when it could be certain that it did
 10 come into existence. It may have come into existence
 11 earlier, and the grand jury's charge says from a date
 12 uncertain, but at least by November 18, there was a
 13 conspiracy in place and the following four individuals
 14 were -- are to be charged as co-conspirators, plus others
 15 unknown to the grand jury. 
 16 Now, in light of the way the facts actually
 17 panned out at -- at the trial, and given the holdings of
 18 the Ninth Circuit that the Government failed to prove
 19 pre-seizure involvement on the part of the respondent
 20 couriers, the indictment might have more accurately been
 21 written to say that on November 18th, at least, a
 22 conspiracy was formed, and by November 19th the
 23 respondents joined it. The --
 24 QUESTION: Could the Government have charged a
 25 separate, second conspiracy if it had chosen to do so? 

21
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think so, Justice Kennedy,
 2 because the crucial aspect of a conspiracy and a defining,
 3 limiting principle is the scope of the nature of the
 4 agreement. Courts have worked out a multi-factor test to
 5 determine whether you have one agreement or two
 6 agreements. And it focuses not on literal identity of
 7 membership or complete chronological co-existence of the
 8 participation of each conspirator, but whether there's a
 9 common agreement which each is seeking to advance forward
 10 in his own way and whether the excess of one is dependent
 11 on the efforts of the others. 
 12 Now, in this case, construed most narrowly, the
 13 indictment alleges a conspiracy to move drugs, staring in
 14 Phoenix, Arizona, through Las Vegas, and all the way up to
 15 Idaho and then perhaps beyond that. That is the
 16 conspiracy in which respondents were involved as
 17 substitute couriers brought in to move the truck from the
 18 Karcher Mall in Idaho to its ultimate destination. That's
 19 the same conspiracy that existed at the outset. The
 20 original couriers, had they not been arrested, would have
 21 completed the trip. So what you have is one common
 22 agreement in which all participants are working to achieve
 23 the same goal, and there is only a switch of two members,
 24 the two couriers, midstream --
 25 QUESTION: But you were going back to -- I think

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 you hadn't completed your answer to why it's okay that
 2 even though the proof as to these two defendants starts on
 3 the 19th, not on the 18th, it's okay to have the
 4 indictment say they were participants from the 18th. 
 5 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, if you read the
 6 indictment as alleging that they were involved on the 18th
 7 and we didn't show that they were involved until the
 8 19th -- and as the case comes to this Court, that's what
 9 we showed -- you have a variance between the allegations
 10 of the indictment and the proof at trial. And the settled
 11 law on variances is that it is no defense for a defendant
 12 if the proof varies from the conspiracy charged in the
 13 indictment so long as the conspiracy that's proved up is
 14 within the scope of the indictment, a lesser included
 15 conspiracy, so to speak, and the defendants suffer no
 16 prejudice from the variation. 
 17 Now, in this case, everyone knew from the outset
 18 that the centerpiece of the Government's proof against
 19 respondents was going to be the observation of them
 20 driving up after the call was placed to the Arizona
 21 supplier of the drugs and getting into the truck and
 22 driving the truck away down the highway in Idaho,
 23 following which they were stopped and gave completely
 24 unbelievable stories about what they were doing driving
 25 around with a truck filled with drugs. There was no

23
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 prejudice to the defendants in defending against a
 2 conspiracy that was proved up based on the events of
 3 the 18th because those events were always going to be at
 4 the heart of the Government's proof that they were liable. 
 5 So absent a showing of prejudice, the variance between the
 6 allegations of the indictment and the proof at trial does
 7 not warrant any relief. 
 8 QUESTION: But your -- your principal argument
 9 is not in response to variance. It's simply that on
 10 the 19th they became -- excuse me -- they became part of a
 11 conspiracy that had begun at least by the 18th.
 12 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct. 
 13 QUESTION: That's -- that's the essence of your
 14 position. 
 15 MR. DREEBEN: That's -- the essence of our
 16 argument is that -- and the Ninth Circuit in ruling that
 17 the evidence was insufficient did not rely on principles
 18 of variance or principles of multiple conspiracies or any
 19 other fact-based, record-based analysis that would show
 20 that the Government didn't prove the conspiracy alleged in
 21 the indictment. 
 22 What the Ninth Circuit relied on was its holding
 23 in Cruz which is that a conspiracy ends when the
 24 Government intervenes and renders its completion
 25 impossible. And the Ninth Circuit, therefore, reasoned

24
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 that respondents could not have joined the conspiracy
 2 alleged in the indictment because that conspiracy was, as
 3 a factual matter, over. Accordingly, the only way on the
 4 Ninth Circuit's view that the Government could win this
 5 case is if the Government showed that respondents joined
 6 the conspiracy before the seizure of the drugs, or if they
 7 were involved in a broader conspiracy that involved other
 8 drugs. Only under those two assumptions did the Ninth
 9 Circuit think that the Government could prevail. 
 10 And the Ninth Circuit held that the evidence was
 11 not sufficient to prove either of those other
 12 conspiratorial activities. It never questioned that the
 13 evidence was overwhelming to prove a conspiracy to
 14 participate in the distribution of drugs on November 19th,
 15 when respondents showed up and got in the truck. 
 16 And because the Ninth Circuit was wrong in its
 17 holding that a conspiracy terminates when it becomes
 18 factually impossible of accomplishment, the rest of its
 19 analysis also crumbles. 
 20 I'd like to save the remainder of my time for
 21 rebuttal. 
 22 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Dreeben. 
 23 Mr. Shurtliff, we'll hear from you.
 24 ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. KARL SHURTLIFF
 25 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

25
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SHURTLIFF: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please
 2 the Court, counsel:
 3 Mr. Sullivan and I expect that we were not
 4 invited here to argue our view that the case below was
 5 decided on the sufficiency of the evidence question. 
 6 However, having said that, we would not wish to have it
 7 taken that we abandon that argument. 
 8 Mr. Chief Justice, a number of the questions
 9 posed seemed to go to the heart of what this case is
 10 about. Justice Stevens asked, what was the conspiracy
 11 that survived? 
 12 The Government argues at length in the brief and
 13 here today that -- notwithstanding the charge in the
 14 indictment and the trial of this case below -- that by
 15 November 18th, 1997, Mr. Recio and Mr. Lopez-Mesa could be
 16 charged with the crime. The fact of the matter is, is
 17 that the indictment framed what this case was about by
 18 November 18th. 
 19 QUESTION: Well, Mr. Shurtliff, the only
 20 question presented in the petition for certiorari is
 21 whether a conspiracy ends as a matter of law when the
 22 Government frustrates its objective. Now is -- is -- are
 23 what you're about to say going to deal with that question?
 24 MR. SHURTLIFF: It is, Mr. Chief Justice,
 25 because that's the argument that the Government makes that

26
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 we should not sustain the Ninth Circuit decision in this
 2 case as framed by Judge Browning who formulated the
 3 decision. 
 4 QUESTION: Well, but the Government formulated
 5 the question here. 
 6 MR. SHURTLIFF: I -- I understand that,
 7 Mr. Chief Justice, and -- and we do speak to that. 
 8 The -- the question was posed, What conspiracy
 9 survives, and I'm suggesting that no conspiracy survived,
 10 and that the answer is, is that the Government framed the
 11 case as they would have it and that the issues that the
 12 Government talks about here today and in their brief at
 13 length as to when the -- these two late-comers to the
 14 conspiracy enter -- came into it -- obscures that notion.
 15 Your Honor -- or Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the
 16 question posited in the -- in the petition for certiorari,
 17 with all due respect, I don't think has been really argued
 18 here much today by the Government. The -- the question is
 19 correctly whether a conspiracy ends as a matter of law
 20 when the Government frustrates its objective. 
 21 That is taken from the formulation of former
 22 Chief Judge Browning in this case below that he -- all
 23 they said was -- in describing the case here and referring
 24 back to Cruz -- in Cruz we ruled that a defendant could
 25 not be charged with conspiracy to distribute illegal drugs

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 when the defendant was brought into the drug scheme only
 2 after the law enforcement authorities had already
 3 intervened and defendant's involvement was prompted by
 4 that intervention. 
 5 The Ninth Circuit didn't say that this was an
 6 impossibility case, that it was impossible for the
 7 conspiracy to continue as to other people. What the Ninth
 8 Circuit said in that case was in these circumstances -- in
 9 these limited circumstances, in Cruz and in Recio -- that
 10 given the Government intervention in the objective of the
 11 conspiracy, given the Government intervention and the
 12 invitation after that to join the conspiracy by Recio and
 13 Lopez, that they couldn't join the conspiracy. It was a
 14 new --
 15 QUESTION: Why would impossibility caused by the
 16 Government be any different from impossibility caused by
 17 somebody else? You -- you want to reframe -- you -- you
 18 think that we could answer this question no, but still
 19 find for your clients because this is not just
 20 impossibility simpliciter, this is impossibility produced
 21 by the Government. 
 22 MR. SHURTLIFF: I think, Mr. Justice Scalia,
 23 that you could answer the question no and still find for
 24 our clients because this is not the case. This is not why
 25 they were -- the Ninth Circuit reversed their convictions. 

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 The --
 2 QUESTION: There wasn't impossibility at all?
 3 MR. SHURTLIFF: There wasn't impossibility.
 4 QUESTION: What was it? 
 5 MR. SHURTLIFF: It was termination. They
 6 added -- typically and historically --
 7 QUESTION: Well, why was it terminated? It was
 8 terminated -- people didn't write notes to each other
 9 saying, you know, Let's call off the conspiracy. It was
 10 terminated, the Ninth Circuit found, because its object
 11 was no longer possible. I thought that's why they found
 12 it had terminated. 
 13 MR. SHURTLIFF: The object, Mr. Justice Scalia,
 14 was -- was frustrated by the Government intervention. 
 15 The --
 16 QUESTION: But the Government's position is
 17 there's only two ways a conspiracy can end. One we know
 18 is not this case. They didn't succeed. The other, the
 19 Government says, is that the conspirators have to abandon
 20 it, not that it becomes -- there's an impediment to its
 21 completion, but abandonment by one person, if she
 22 withdraws from the conspiracy and tells the police, for
 23 example, or tells the co-conspirators. But an
 24 impediment -- another impediment -- doesn't stop the
 25 conspiracy from persisting. 

29
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 And the Ninth Circuit I thought pretty clearly
 2 said, Yes, it does, and that -- wasn't there rather sharp
 3 disagreement among the Ninth Circuit judges over this? 
 4 They didn't treat it as a question of sufficiency of the
 5 evidence. 
 6 MR. SHURTLIFF: Indeed, Justice Ginsburg, there
 7 was sharp disagreement. Justice -- Judge O'Scannlain and
 8 eight other members of the court dissented from the -- not
 9 granting the rehearing en banc. 
 10 However, what -- the point I seek to make, not
 11 very well, apparently -- is -- is that what the court
 12 below did not say was that it was impossible to have a
 13 conspiracy, but that they added to abandonment and
 14 accomplishment a new ability to frustrate or end the
 15 conspiracy. That is Government -- and -- and narrowly. 
 16 Government intervention that frustrates its objective and
 17 that Government intervention invited the new participants
 18 into it. 
 19 And Justice Ginsburg, you -- you inquired as to
 20 what -- or, Justice O'Connor, as to the -- as to the --
 21 what the Model Penal Code might say about that. And I
 22 would suggest that in that regard, Wharton, in describing
 23 that, said -- suggests that the Model Penal court -- Code
 24 suggests the position that if the conduct is, quote, "so
 25 inherently unlikely to result or culminate in the

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 commission of a crime that no public danger is presented
 2 warranting defendant's punishment as a conspirator." 
 3 And I think that's what the Ninth Circuit was
 4 saying in this case, that if we look at this historical
 5 purposes of conspiracy -- and the Government has well
 6 traversed that in its briefs and its reply brief -- that
 7 the gist, the gravamen of a conspiracy is the
 8 combination that -- to agree to do something. 
 9 Mr. Justice Kennedy, you inquired whether to do
 10 something that's not illegal is -- can be a conspiracy,
 11 and I suggest that that -- that's part of what brings us
 12 here is the confusion as to when you can and cannot and
 13 ought not have a conspiracy. 
 14 QUESTION: Well --
 15 QUESTION: But there -- there is a public danger
 16 presented by people who band together to rob a bank even
 17 when there is no money in the bank. It's utterly
 18 impossible. Right? That -- that's quite different from
 19 the -- the unquestionable fact that there's no public
 20 danger presented by people who band together to curse
 21 somebody with -- with a voodoo doll. You can say, well,
 22 you know, That's a harmless conspiracy, but a conspiracy
 23 to rob a bank is not harmless. These are bad people, and
 24 if they don't do this bank, they may do another bank. 
 25 Now, you acknowledge that that is a conspiracy

31
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 even though there -- a criminal conspiracy even though
 2 there's no money in the bank. Right? 
 3 MR. SHURTLIFF: Indeed, Justice Scalia. 
 4 QUESTION: But you say it does -- it is not a
 5 criminal conspiracy if the reason there is no money in --
 6 in the bank is that the Government has removed the money
 7 from the bank knowing that there's going to be a -- a
 8 break-in?
 9 MR. SHURTLIFF: There would be no conspiracy if
 10 the Government had intervened in that conspiracy early on
 11 and the involvement of the participants charged was only
 12 as a result of that involvement. 
 13 QUESTION: So if the Government took the money
 14 out of the bank, that would be different than if there was
 15 just no money there from the outset. 
 16 MR. SHURTLIFF: I'd think not, Mr. Justice
 17 Scalia. I think the -- the question would be what the --
 18 what the participants who were engaged to participate
 19 in -- in the robbing of the bank thought. 
 20 QUESTION: They -- well, in both cases they
 21 thought there was money in the bank. In one case, they
 22 were wrong because there was never money in the bank. It
 23 was a blood bank. Okay?
 24 (Laughter.) 
 25 MR. SHURTLIFF: And --

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: In the second case, there was no
 2 money in the bank because the Government, anticipating
 3 a -- a robbery, had removed it. And you say that there's
 4 something different about the second case.
 5 MR. SHURTLIFF: I -- I don't think there's
 6 anything different, Justice Scalia --
 7 QUESTION: Okay. I don't think so either. 
 8 QUESTION: Then what is your reason? I'm just
 9 trying to get -- A, B, C, and D form a conspiracy to
 10 deprive a person of civil rights, to rob a bank, to commit
 11 an act of terrorism, whatever. They do it on January 1. 
 12 On March -- in March, a Government agent infiltrates. Now
 13 it'll fail. In April three more people join. All right?
 14 Now, why should the law not be those three
 15 people are just as guilty as anybody else? 
 16 MR. SHURTLIFF: Mr. Justice Breyer, they can be,
 17 and they ought to be depending on the facts of the case,
 18 and that's why the --
 19 QUESTION: The facts of the case are just what I
 20 said. Now what? 
 21 MR. SHURTLIFF: I think -- I think they're
 22 guilt -- they -- I think they -- they're in on the
 23 conspiracy.
 24 QUESTION: You think they're guilty. Okay.
 25 MR. SHURTLIFF: They're guilty of the

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 conspiracy. 
 2 QUESTION: They're guilty and they joined
 3 after --
 4 MR. SHURTLIFF: Whether they're guilty or not is
 5 another question. 
 6 QUESTION: No, no. I'm -- all the facts are
 7 just as I say. 
 8 So, they're guilty, and now what they did is,
 9 after all, join it after the infiltration of the
 10 Government agent made it absolutely certain there would be
 11 no success. 
 12 All right. Now, how is that different than the
 13 facts before us? 
 14 MR. SHURTLIFF: Because the facts before us are
 15 that these two individuals joined at the behest of the
 16 Government, and that they were charged and tried for
 17 activity before the date of November 18th, 1997. They
 18 were -- the -- the Government's focus on this case was
 19 narrow. They weren't charged. And one of the
 20 questions --
 21 QUESTION: Now -- now I take -- you say, number
 22 one, you take my hypothetical and say, but the Government
 23 -- what did the Government do that was different from the
 24 hypothetical? The Government --
 25 MR. SHURTLIFF: Intervened. 

34
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: Intervened. Yes, I got that. 
 2 MR. SHURTLIFF: Frustrated. 
 3 QUESTION: They joined it. 
 4 MR. SHURTLIFF: They frustrated the objective of
 5 the conspiracy --
 6 QUESTION: That's true in my hypothetical too. 
 7 Now what? 
 8 MR. SHURTLIFF: And then they encouraged the
 9 participation by their intervention of the --
 10 QUESTION: Oh, they led. I see. The Government
 11 led my three extra people to join. 
 12 MR. SHURTLIFF: Indeed. 
 13 QUESTION: So you're saying it's like an
 14 entrapment. 
 15 MR. SHURTLIFF: It's -- it's similar to, but
 16 different --
 17 QUESTION: No, no. It's not quite as strong as
 18 an entrapment. So what you're argument is, is that where
 19 the Government has joined, thereby frustrating the
 20 objective, and in addition brings about the circumstances
 21 through which the later membership, A, B -- of my three
 22 extra people take place, that's close enough to
 23 entrapment, plus the fact that the conspiracy can't
 24 exceed -- can't succeed. Put those two things together
 25 and you have grounds for not convicting. 

35
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. SHURTLIFF: And you have --
 2 QUESTION: Is that the argument? 
 3 MR. SHURTLIFF: And you have this case,
 4 Mr. Justice Breyer. 
 5 QUESTION: And all right, and you have this
 6 case. But -- so it's like a -- a mix. It's like an
 7 impossibility/entrapment mix. That's the argument. 
 8 MR. SHURTLIFF: Well, I -- I'm not --
 9 QUESTION: I'm not ridiculing the argument. I'm
 10 trying to understand it. It's a -- it's an interesting
 11 argument. 
 12 QUESTION: Is that what the Ninth Circuit said? 
 13 That -- this argument you're making -- is that the basis
 14 on which the Ninth Circuit held that this -- this
 15 conviction couldn't stand? 
 16 I thought it was just simply, you know, whether
 17 they were enticed in or not. The mere fact that -- the
 18 mere fact that it was no longer possible to execute the --
 19 the conspiracy was enough. 
 20 MR. SHURTLIFF: Mr. Justice -- or Justice
 21 Scalia, I -- I don't think that they got to the notion of
 22 entrapment or enticement, and -- and that's -- I think
 23 that -- and so I can't say that -- that that's part of the
 24 predicate for how they got where they got -- went in this
 25 case. I think they focused on the Government intervention

36
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 and the Government involvement without calling it the
 2 typical terms of entrapment --
 3 QUESTION: It relied on Cruz, and in Cruz it
 4 said it extends -- the court said it extends conspiracy
 5 liability beyond reasonable limits to say that it
 6 continues when the product can no longer be delivered and
 7 all that remains is for a new recruit to be added. 
 8 But there is no reason given for that in -- in
 9 Cruz. There must be some legal doctrine that it rests
 10 upon. Impossibility or entrapment are the -- are the two
 11 categories that we know. 
 12 MR. SHURTLIFF: I --
 13 QUESTION: This is something else. I --
 14 MR. SHURTLIFF: Mr. Justice Kennedy, I think --
 15 I think the question was similarly asked to -- to the
 16 Government, and I -- I would probably agree with their
 17 answer. I think they relied on Castro, a predecessor case
 18 from the Ninth Circuit, and then they relied on another
 19 case. 
 20 I think what happened -- I don't know -- was is
 21 that -- like many of us, the more you study the area of
 22 conspiracy, I think the more confused you get. And I
 23 think that's what Justice Jackson was talking about, and I
 24 would urge that we consider what he said because I think 
 25 they -- they blended in and it's different -- it's hard to

37
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 dichotomize between impossibility and termination and
 2 multiple --
 3 QUESTION: Well, I don't -- I don't know what's
 4 confusing about having people with a criminal intent
 5 who -- who join a conspiracy with the intent to violate
 6 the law being called conspirators. That's not -- it
 7 doesn't sound like rocket science to me. 
 8 MR. SHURTLIFF: But, Mr. Justice Kennedy, the --
 9 the -- in Cruz, he was invited to join the conspiracy
 10 after -- only after -- the Government was sitting there
 11 with the drugs and he was a late recruit to the process. 
 12 He wasn't an early conspirator. In this case, these
 13 persons were invited to join only after the Government had
 14 fully intervened. They could have stopped it then. The
 15 only activity was to get new recruits. 
 16 And what the Ninth Circuit said in both cases --
 17 they didn't say they couldn't be charged with a new
 18 conspiracy. They could have been charged with it. 
 19 Indeed, they left that open in both Cruz and here. They
 20 could have been charged in a new conspiracy for the
 21 activities that they engaged in. 
 22 QUESTION: Well, you think that this
 23 defendant -- these defendants could have been charged in a
 24 new conspiracy? It seems that -- that undercuts your
 25 argument. I thought the whole purpose of this argument

38
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 was to have some reasonable confines on how long a
 2 conspiracy can exist after everybody knows it's not going
 3 to go forward. And now you say there was a second
 4 conspiracy that could have been charged? 
 5 MR. SHURTLIFF: I think they could have been
 6 charged with a second conspiracy starting on the 19th. 
 7 They weren't charged. I -- I --
 8 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben said that was a variance
 9 whether it was the -- they joined on the 18th or the 19th. 
 10 The question is what did they join, and why should it make
 11 a difference?
 12 MR. SHURTLIFF: It should --
 13 QUESTION: If these defendants didn't know there
 14 had been any seizure, why should it -- why should their
 15 guilt turn on that factor? As far as they're concerned,
 16 this is a truck that has gotten by the Government's
 17 surveillance. 
 18 MR. SHURTLIFF: Justice Ginsburg, the -- the
 19 question of variance is another one of those little things
 20 that pop up and confuse some of us. 
 21 But the issue in this case, there was no
 22 variance because the Government said, we indict you for
 23 activity by November 18th, 1997. The prosecutor stood
 24 before the jury in his opening and his closing. The
 25 instructions all went to the issue, We will show that

39
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 these persons were engaged in this activity for either a
 2 single load -- the load at issue -- or that they were
 3 members of a larger conspiracy before November 18th, 1997.
 4 QUESTION: But that's not --
 5 MR. SHURTLIFF: That's not variance. 
 6 QUESTION: -- that's -- that's not part of the
 7 question before this Court. The question before this
 8 Court is whether a conspiracy ends as a matter of law when
 9 the Government frustrates its objective. And whether
 10 there might be some other grounds that the Ninth Circuit
 11 might have decided it on, that is not before us.
 12 MR. SHURTLIFF: And as to that issue, Mr. Chief
 13 Justice, as we said it in our briefs and I said it in my
 14 brief specifically, I believe, that the policy that's come
 15 down through the -- through the -- conspiracy is not that
 16 old -- that there is no good reason why the answer to that
 17 question ought not be yes, that a -- that a -- it is
 18 terminated as absolutely as if the conspiracy were
 19 abandoned or if it were accomplished because there is no
 20 good -- there is no chance of it being successful. 
 21 There's no chance of the unified activity creating the
 22 dangers that we speak of and -- when we're -- when we're
 23 trying to combat conspiracy. 
 24 QUESTION: And that -- and that would follow --
 25 that would also be true if the project was impossible from

40
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the outset. Right? That -- I mean, that's what I don't
 2 understand. You -- you say if -- if they enter in a --
 3 into a conspiracy to rob a bank in which there is no
 4 money, that can be prosecuted. Right? 
 5 MR. SHURTLIFF: It has been, Mr. --
 6 QUESTION: Well, I know it has been, you say. 
 7 But it can -- but it can be. 
 8 MR. SHURTLIFF: Surely. Surely.
 9 QUESTION: Well, why doesn't that violate your
 10 principle? You say there's no harm done there either.
 11 There is just as -- just as much no concrete harm that
 12 could have been done there except the harm of wicked
 13 people banding together, which is what -- what the crime
 14 of conspiracy is directed against. Why should it make any
 15 different -- difference whether the impossibility exists
 16 from the outset, or whether -- whether it -- it occurs
 17 later in the scheme. What -- why does that make any
 18 difference? 
 19 MR. SHURTLIFF: I think it probably should not
 20 make much difference --
 21 QUESTION: No, I don't think so. 
 22 MR. SHURTLIFF: -- in a lot of cases, but I
 23 think each case is fact-specific, Mr. Justice Scalia. And
 24 I think in this case you have to look at what was charged,
 25 what was tried, and what the conspiracy was about. And --

41
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 QUESTION: May I ask? Are the -- are the
 2 instructions to the jury in the papers before us? 
 3 MR. SHURTLIFF: I'm not real -- I'm not -- I'm
 4 not really sure, Mr. Justice Stevens.
 5 QUESTION: Yes.
 6 MR. SHURTLIFF: The -- the -- we didn't do an
 7 excerpt for the record. I think it's in the petition for
 8 certiorari. 
 9 QUESTION: The instructions are in the petition?
 10 MR. SHURTLIFF: Some of them are referred to. I
 11 don't know that we've listed -- I don't think all of the
 12 instructions are in the record here. 
 13 The -- the instruction as to the conspiracy. 
 14 And that's how it was charged that it -- that they had to
 15 belong before or after -- before and not after. 
 16 The --
 17 QUESTION: It says that the conspiracy began on
 18 or about that date, but then it says the defendants became
 19 member. It doesn't say the date the defendants became
 20 member.
 21 QUESTION: Why don't you proceed with your
 22 argument? 
 23 MR. SHURTLIFF: Thank -- thank you.
 24 The issues here raise difficult questions. The
 25 whole area of conspiracy raises difficult questions of

42
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 interpretation and -- and law. I suggest, and we suggest
 2 that the decision below is not as far-reaching as it might
 3 otherwise appear, that Justice Browning formulated a
 4 result in this case that's much narrower than what we're
 5 about. 
 6 But on the other hand, having said that, and
 7 being here, the question is whether the Government
 8 intervention in these circumstances, in these extant
 9 circumstances, ought end the opportunity and the ability
 10 to join a conspiracy. We simply urge that frustration of
 11 the purpose of the -- by the Government -- invitation to
 12 join by the Government in these circumstances is no less
 13 or is no more in keeping with the termination of the
 14 conspiracy than would be had they -- some of the people
 15 abandoned the conspiracy or had it been accomplished.
 16 The Government argues that the answer to this
 17 question, if we answered it in the affirmative, would
 18 raise havoc with our ability to prosecute these kinds of
 19 cases. We would suggest that that's not the instance
 20 here. Here in -- here and in Cruz, as near as we can
 21 tell, Cruz has been cited once; this case not at all. 
 22 It's not a set of circumstances that are likely to reoccur
 23 often or with great --
 24 QUESTION: Suppose in this -- suppose in this
 25 case the truck had been apprehended in Arizona, and

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 neither of the participants at that point cooperated with
 2 the police except to tell the police that their
 3 instructions were to drive the truck to a certain place. 
 4 Then without any Government intervention in calling Recio
 5 and his buddy -- Recio and -- and his co-defendant show up
 6 without any Government intervention. So we have the
 7 Government seizure, just as you do in this case, but the
 8 scenario plays out just as it was arranged without any
 9 Government intervention. In that case, would you say that
 10 the -- that the conspiracy continued and these people are
 11 properly prosecuted? 
 12 MR. SHURTLIFF: Yes.
 13 QUESTION: May I ask --
 14 MR. SHURTLIFF: But that's not what happened
 15 here. The -- the -- they were intercepted --
 16 QUESTION: You're making it turn on the
 17 Government having a part in bringing in the latecomers.
 18 MR. SHURTLIFF: And -- and I -- I retreat again
 19 to the -- what they were charged with and what the
 20 indictment was and what they -- that we will prove that
 21 they were involved by November 18th, 1997. We will prove
 22 that. That's what this case is about. That's what they
 23 kept saying and they argued that throughout. 
 24 Now, here they want to suggest that -- that by
 25 going to the 19th, it provokes no prejudice on the part of

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 the defendants. That's not the case they were charged
 2 with. That's not the case that was tried below. And so,
 3 in your hypothetical, Justice Ginsburg, I think yes, but
 4 there was no involvement and -- and depending on how they
 5 were charged. And I --
 6 QUESTION: Counsel, it -- it looks like the
 7 instruction to the jury said that a defendant may only be
 8 found guilty of the conspiracy charged in the indictment
 9 if he joined the conspiracy at a time when it was possible
 10 to achieve the objective of that conspiracy. Was that the
 11 instruction given them? 
 12 MR. SHURTLIFF: It was, Justice O'Connor. 
 13 QUESTION: So that means the jury must have
 14 found that -- that there was evidence sufficient to say
 15 they joined before the impossibility occurred.
 16 MR. SHURTLIFF: Indeed. 
 17 QUESTION: Did the Government object to that
 18 instruction, do you know? 
 19 MR. SHURTLIFF: No. The Government supported
 20 that, Mr. Justice Stevens. 
 21 QUESTION: What should happen if the trial judge
 22 faithfully followed Cruz? And under Cruz, the jury should
 23 not have found him liable, but we say that Cruz is wrong. 
 24 Does it still have to go back for a new trial? 
 25 Because the -- on page 76a of the appendix, the

45
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 instructions seem to say that -- one of two things. You
 2 can only find him guilty of the conspiracy if he joined it
 3 prior to 1:18 a.m. on November 18th. On the other hand,
 4 if you find there's a larger conspiracy, you can find him
 5 guilty, but that larger conspiracy must be to distribute
 6 other drugs than those that were seized. So I -- I
 7 suppose the proof doesn't support either of those
 8 conspiracies. 
 9 MR. SHURTLIFF: And -- and that, Mr. Justice
 10 Kennedy, is what the Ninth Circuit said, that it doesn't
 11 support either the single load --
 12 QUESTION: What happens if we think this
 13 instruction was wrong? Under the evidence, the defendants
 14 should have been convicted, and that Cruz is wrong. Do we
 15 still have to send it back? 
 16 MR. SHURTLIFF: I think, Mr. Justice Kennedy,
 17 you send it back to the Ninth Circuit for a determination
 18 whether, but for a decision that Cruz is incorrectly
 19 applied in the facts in this case, would the decision
 20 below remain the same. 
 21 And I suggest, with all due respect to the
 22 Government's position in this case, that the -- that it
 23 could be concluded that notwithstanding the application of
 24 Cruz in the Ninth Circuit below, that the decision of the
 25 Ninth Circuit could by -- almost by redacting it,

46
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 eliminating the references to Cruz -- come to the same
 2 conclusion. The evidence was just simply insufficient to
 3 sustain the conviction for either the single load or the
 4 multi-load before November 18th.
 5 QUESTION: Of course --
 6 QUESTION: Assuming Cruz is right. Assuming
 7 Cruz is right.
 8 QUESTION: I'm assuming Cruz is wrong, and then
 9 it would seem to me the evidence is fully sufficient to
 10 convict if Cruz is wrong because it doesn't make any
 11 difference if they joined it before or after 1:18 a.m. on
 12 the 18th.
 13 QUESTION: Can I ask another question? Is
 14 there -- is it conceivable that the jury found that the
 15 evidence after the impossibility was sufficient to sustain
 16 the verdict? Because they weren't asked to find that. 
 17 I mean, I don't -- as I understand Mr. Dreeben's
 18 argument, there was plenty of evidence later on, that they
 19 joined the -- they joined an ongoing conspiracy, but the
 20 charge didn't ask them to find that, as I -- maybe
 21 Mr. Dreeben will comment on it in his rebuttal. I --
 22 MR. SHURTLIFF: I -- I think that's entirely
 23 correct, Justice Stevens. The -- the jury wasn't asked to
 24 find that, and the -- and the Government was very careful
 25 in the way they tried this case. We will show you that

47
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 by, and the whole case was by. In the Ninth Circuit, the
 2 issue was whether by that date the indictment and the --
 3 and the trial. 
 4 The -- if -- if Cruz is -- if Cruz is wrong, the
 5 question would still be whether these persons entered into
 6 a conspiracy. 
 7 QUESTION: And had you raised that further
 8 question in the Ninth Circuit? In other words, did you go
 9 to the Ninth Circuit and say, Apply Cruz, period, or did
 10 you go to the Ninth Circuit with other reasons?
 11 MR. SHURTLIFF: Mr. Justice -- or Justice
 12 Souter, we -- we went to the Ninth Circuit with -- with
 13 other reasons because the court --
 14 QUESTION: Okay.
 15 MR. SHURTLIFF: -- in the instructions that
 16 we've read did apply Cruz, and everybody was satisfied --
 17 QUESTION: I just wanted to know whether -- I
 18 just wanted to know whether you had raised anything beyond
 19 a Cruz point, and the answer is yes, okay. 
 20 MR. SHURTLIFF: The sufficiency of the evidence,
 21 ineffective -- there were several issues raised and -- and
 22 decided. 
 23 The Government suggests that if we allow this
 24 decision to stand, that it would cause irreparable injury
 25 and damage to the ability of the Government to prosecute

48
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 crime, to catch people who are miscreants, and that it
 2 would make inordinately difficult the choices of the
 3 prosecutor in determining what and how to charge. We
 4 would suggest simply that that's the obligation of the
 5 prosecutors now. Cruz doesn't add any burdens to the
 6 prosecutorial responsibility. 
 7 Thank you. 
 8 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Shurtliff.
 9 Mr. Dreeben, you have 3 minutes remaining.
 10 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
 11 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 12 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 13 please the Court:
 14 To address the jury instruction issue first, the
 15 jury in this case was instructed in accordance with the
 16 requirements of Cruz, and therefore, the jury was asked to
 17 find whether there was evidence of respondents'
 18 involvement in the conspiracy before the seizure of the
 19 drugs or, alternatively, whether they were involved in a
 20 broader conspiracy, not limited to the drugs that were
 21 seized. 
 22 At pages 6 through 8 of our reply brief at the
 23 petition stage, we addressed the consequences of what
 24 happens if this Court should conclude that the Cruz legal
 25 rule is incorrect. And in essence, our position is that

49
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 any rational jury that found guilt under the Cruz
 2 instructions also would have found that respondents were
 3 involved in a conspiracy to distribute the very drugs that
 4 they drove to the Karcher Mall to pick up. That was the
 5 centerpiece of the Government's evidence, that respondents
 6 were involved in a conspiracy, and the fact that the jury
 7 may have found that respondents were involved in a longer
 8 conspiracy, or in other conspiracies wouldn't detract from
 9 the rationality of its necessarily concluding that the
 10 respondents were also involved in this conspiracy. 
 11 Even if this Court didn't agree with that
 12 rationale or chose not to reach it, it's important to note
 13 that the effect of the Ninth Circuit's holding is to find
 14 insufficient evidence to prove the crime charged in the
 15 indictment. That doesn't leave the Government with the
 16 option of pursuing a new trial on correct instructions
 17 with the Cruz findings purged from them. It would mean
 18 that respondents have permanent immunity from the crime
 19 that's charged in the indictment. If this Court were to
 20 conclude that Cruz is wrong, and either this Court or the
 21 Ninth Circuit also concluded that the jury instructions
 22 somehow prejudiced the defendants, the remedy would be a
 23 new trial. 
 24 It is also important, I believe, to note that
 25 the -- the principle that the Ninth Circuit has adopted

50
Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1 would go contrary to what this Court has noted about the
 2 evolution of conspiracies. In a case called Blumenthal
 3 versus United States, which we did not cite in our briefs,
 4 but it appears at 332 U.S. 539, the Court noted that
 5 conspiracies involving elaborate arrangements generally
 6 are not born full-grown. Rather, they mature by
 7 successive stages which are necessary to bring in the
 8 essential parties. 
 9 And in this case, two essential parties were
 10 brought in not at the inception of the conspiracy, but
 11 after events that the conspirators were aware of required
 12 that new couriers were brought in. They were not aware
 13 that the Government had seized the drugs, but they knew
 14 that they needed new couriers. They brought them in. 
 15 Under the principles of Blumenthal, that's all one
 16 conspiracy. 
 17 Respondents' counsel has mentioned the Model
 18 Penal Code provisions. The Model Penal Code at section
 19 5.01 addresses the question of impossibility under attempt
 20 law and concludes that the defense should not be
 21 recognized and at section 5.03 does the same for
 22 conspiracy. 
 23 Finally -- thank you. 
 24 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,
 25 Mr. Dreeben.
