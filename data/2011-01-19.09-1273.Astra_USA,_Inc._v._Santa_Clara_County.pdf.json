The first reason is that this common law breach of contract suit is indistinguishable from an implied right of action to enforce the statute, a right Respondent concedes it does not have."

And the -- what is being challenged here is the contractual term that incorporates in haec verba the manufacturer's ceiling price obligations under the Act, and a third-party beneficiary's suit to enforce the contract asserts the same right, seeks the same remedy, and causes all the same disruptions as a right of action to enforce the statute. And another way of saying that is, if the case begins with the premise that Congress foreclosed 340B entities from bringing an implied right of action through the front door, Congress did not leave the back door open to essentially the same suit."

  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "Right. Well, our position is obviously that the parties had no discretion to confer Article III power on courts to enforce an Act of Congress, and this is. But the -- the basic answer is that there has always been a huge difference between the settled rule that parties to a statutory contract are enforceable -- they have a cause of action to enforce the contract, because Congress spoke with unambiguously clear language that the parties could sue. That's the way statutory contracts must work. They must be enforceable. But your answer, sort of as a practical matter, what's the difference, is this is a -- this is a contract, and we do think that the Federal law of contracts and contractual remedies flow between the parties to the contract. It's a bilateral agreement, it's not a regulation, and the Secretary made specific beneficiaries under a statute do not have the right to enforce it unless there's a cause of action. Now, the test that I think Respondent advocates and that the Ninth Circuit applied is a test this Court has long since discarded, which is: Well, I'm a beneficiary, and this is a good idea, and this is sensible. Even if you don't buy our test of you have to imply the implied right of action, these lawsuits are neither sensible nor a good idea and not what Congress intended. And here's why. And it is basically the second and third reasons. So no matter how you come at this case and the lens through which you look at this, I think everyone should come out to the same place, which is that neither Congress nor the Secretary nor the manufacturers signed up to what is in essence -- would be over 14,000 lawsuits against 500 manufacturers challenging the pricing for over 35,000 medications under Medicaid."

But one of the harms, and sort of illustrating just how bad the decision was, is this conferred rights that the parties never imagined and that the Secretary did not -- did not intend. But I -- I think that, in our view, even if the Secretary had wanted to, it's not the Secretary's decision nor was it the manufacturers' decision to go contract by contract and say this multi-billion dollar health care program that incorporates another, even bigger multi-billion dollar health care program -- we're going to turn this over to Federal enforcement, when on the face of the statute reflects a deliberate decision by Congress to withhold -­"

And if there's a breach of that, there are contractual remedies that flow. But I agree with you that there's not a whole lot difference between our position and the Government, because the Government is absolutely correct that it's in haec verba and identical, and the statutory obligation that we're talking about that's incorporated into the contract is that a certain ceiling price must be charged. But the -- the other sort of practical function is only manufacturers who enter into this contract are subject to these price controls.

That would be an odd contract. I don't see the Secretary entering into third-party beneficiary contracts. A much more efficient way would just be to contract with the entity itself.

For third-party beneficiary rights to create an enforceable breach of contract claim, the parties to the contract do not have to have a provision in the contract saying \"and therefore the intended third parties get to bring a breach of contract claim.\" That's never been the accepted law. The law has always said if the parties intend to create third-party beneficiaries and bringing of that suit to enforce the contract would be within the claim to be so disruptive is that all we're arguing for is the bargain that the manufacturers agreed to undertake."

And third-party beneficiary rights have been recognized for 350 years, even before the founding of this republic. Now, as to the disruption, I think it's a canard, because what we're talking about here is one price that would govern all 14,500 covered entities. So if Santa Clara gets the discount price for Lipitor, say, that is the best price, and it will be charged and in this suit."

But what I would say is that if you reject our argument here, you are substantially undercutting the ability of the States to bring the same kinds of overcharging claims against drug manufacturers under the Medicaid rebate program. That's what the States' amicus brief here makes clear. The SG has a very fuzzy footnote at the very end of the Government's brief that does not set forth a clear standard that differentiates why 340B entities' third-party beneficiary rights are any different from States' rights under the Medicaid rebate program."

And to the extent that that analysis bears out anything, it tends to cast doubt on the Government's theory that these are somehow regulatory contracts that suggest a blurring of the normal lines between regulation and contract. That theory, the regulatory contract theory, has been rejected by this Court in Winstar and in Mobil Oil, where the Government tried to argue that because it was implementing regulatory policy through contracts, somehow normal contract principles don't apply, and this Court rejected that."

The Government, I don't think, can point to a specific provision of the cooperative federalism that empowers States to engage in any greater enforcement power than a normal third-party beneficiary under this Court's normal cases, and back to Central Airlines and American Surety, which, a hundred years ago, recognized a third-party beneficiary's right to bring suit on a breach of contract and held that the absence of a specific enforcement power in the statute was not enough to deny the normal operation of law for the breached party to sue for that breach. That's common in the law."

And I think you would have come to a different result in the Miree v. DeKalb County case, in which the Court said that just because there is an FAA contract with a local airport authority does not deny a third-party beneficiary right to sue if there is an adverse effect on adjoining land because you would have said that, because the adjoining land owner had no specific enforcement authority, that person or entity would be out of luck.

They've been charging in excess of that price, and all we're asking for is the delta. And the Government in its Massachusetts submissions has acknowledged that this type of best price litigation is not so complicated because all one needs to do is figure out did the drug companies sell the particular drug to some other entity for a lower price; and if that's so, that's the price you apply across the board to all the 340B entities. The argument about distraction and intrusion, Justice Ginsburg, I would respectfully submit, is a gross overstatement of what actually happens in this type of litigation. And to the extent that there are complexities, the complexities are introduced by the drug companies for the sole purpose of masking what price they are charging to the 340B entities. Because all these various mechanisms, the program through statutes, it was that the 340B entities who are providing drugs and medical service to the poorest of our citizens should be entitled to the benefits of the collective market created by these 340B drug purchases. And that's all that we're asking for here."

And the reason we don't know is because the Secretary has already missed the first statutory deadline for issuing implementing regulations. There was no statement of rules in the apply. But I would submit that this Court's cases are very clear, that a later enactment of Congress is not intent of what an earlier Congress has stated, and the absence of any specific remedial provision coupled with the use of agreements carries with it the ordinary presumption that Congress intended for that cluster of common law rights to be associated with the agreement. And that's certainly been the way this Court has enforced contracts involving the government itself. If there are no further questions, we'll submit."

And I'd also -- probably even a better response is you can look at any rebate release issued by the Secretary of HHS or any page of their CFR, and if you think it's simple, I would be shocked. On Lipitor, it's not the case that the Central District of California decides nationwide what the price of Lipitor is. The -- under the other side's view, the Southern District of Texas, the Northern District of New York, and the District in Alabama would all decide. And what's really bad -- it is bad enough to have 14,000 suits over 35,000 drugs, but what he's talking about, best price and average manufacturer price that determines the State rebate program -- because the rebate program is a rebate, and the ceiling price program is a ceiling price, when one of the pricing components goes up, such as average manufacturer price, the States benefit. They get more money. But, generally, 340B entities -- their ceiling price goes up. So what's good for the 340B company -- or entity is bad for the States. And that's not disputed. He just says it's hypothetical. But he's asked for millions and millions and millions and millions and more millions of transactions that go to that very pricing component. Common law. On pages 9 to 11a of the petition appendix is a good three or four citations to the third-party beneficiary Federal common law. And the courts go out of their way to say it's not enough to be a direct beneficiary. The analysis is exactly the same under implied right of action. Is there clear and unambiguous intent to confer enforceable rights? It's the same. We just think because it's in haec verba with the statute, it's congressional intent that's controlling, not the parties. I could talk about States if you want. Otherwise, I'm happy to just ask for the decision to be reversed. All right. Then we would ask that the decision be reversed. (Laughter.)"
