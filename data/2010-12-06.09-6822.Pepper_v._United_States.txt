1 2 PROCEEDINGS 3 (11:05 a.m.) 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 5 next this morning in Case 09-6822, Pepper v. United 6 States. 7 Mr. Parrish. 8 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALFREDO PARRISH 9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 10 MR. PARRISH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 11 please the Court: 12 Having successfully completed drug treatment 13 in prison and having come home to succeed as a college 14 student, valued employee, and family man, Jason Pepper 15 presents to this Court two questions: Whether 16 post-sentencing rehabilitation is a permissible basis 17 for a downward variance from the sentencing guidelines 18 at resentencing, and whether the district court judge in 19 Pepper's resentencing was bound by the law of the case 20 doctrine in its 5K departure ruling absent new facts, 21 changes in the controlling law, or to avoid a manifest 22 injustice. 23 Post-sentencing rehabilitation has 24 traditionally been a relevant factor for judges to 25 consider and is now a permissible ground for a

1 non-guideline sentence. 3553(a) and 3661 are the 2 authorities permitting post-sentencing rehabilitation as 3 a consideration for variance. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I think 5 you -- I think you've got a difficult job navigating 6 between your two issues. It seems on the first one, the 7 40 percent to 20 percent, you're saying: Look, you've 8 got to stick with what you did before. And when it gets 9 to the post-sentencing consideration, you're saying: 10 Well, we can -- all bets are off; we can start -- start 11 anew; we can look at things that have happened since. 12 Is there a way you reconcile that - 13 those -- that tension? 14 MR. PARRISH: They're like apples and 15 oranges. The law of the case doctrine is what you refer 16 to as a matter that's left in the district court. The 17 other issue of the -- whether or not the individual 18 qualifies for downward variance is a completely separate 19 issue. The law of the case remains with the district 20 court judge. 21 In the other issue that we have, it's 22 whether or not he's entitled to a downward variance 23 based upon the book of remedies. So they are not, in 24 fact, the same issues. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the law of the case -

1 MR. PARRISH: And there is no tension - 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the law in the case is 3 left to the district court, then the district court can 4 say, well, the law of the case -- that's what that other 5 judge said, but it was a question of what's a reasonable 6 time, and I'm -- I appraise it differently. 7 The -- the judgment has been vacated, the 8 sentence has been vacated, so how does the law of the 9 case survive? I mean, is -- the judgment is no 10 longer - 11 MR. PARRISH: The law of the case survives 12 on a couple of basic principles. One, there has to be 13 new facts that the district court judge heard; there has 14 to be a change of controlling law; and there has to be a 15 reason to avoid a manifest injustice. 16 If you go back to the 5K, one departure that 17 the first judge made the decision on, that law -- that 18 was the law of the case. That percentage followed 19 Mr. Pepper straight through the process. That's a 20 totally separate ruling from any of the other factors in 21 this case that relate to his downward variance. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can a district judge say 23 later on in the process: I made a ruling earlier in the 24 case; I've since done a lot of research, and I now think 25 that that ruling was wrong?

1 MR. PARRISH: Absolutely, they can do that. 2 The circumstances would be, did they see new facts? Was 3 there a change of controlling law? The reason we do 4 this is because we want to have confidence in that 5 decision to make sure litigants don't go judge shopping. 6 So that's part of the reason this law of the 7 case doctrine is in there. Even in Judge Posner's 8 Seventh Circuit decision we cite in our brief, you defer 9 to the first judge. But any time a judge can 10 reconsider; there's no problem with that. 11 But the law of the case in the 5K departure, 12 when the first district judge heard substantial evidence 13 with regard to the issue of cooperation, and that's what 14 he did. When the next judge heard it, she heard no new 15 facts, no change in controlling law, and absolutely 16 heard no evidence with regard to - 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel - 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's kind of 19 a fortuitous situation, then. You're sort of saying if 20 you end up with the same judge, she can reconsider her 21 own prior determination. But if you, for whatever 22 reason, the death of the first judge, you're in a 23 different judge, she's bound by what went before. That 24 doesn't seem right. 25 MR. PARRISH: Well, that's an excellent
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 example -- bound by -- but you have to look at the law 2 of the case and make a decision whether or not new facts 3 came in, there was a change of controlling law. 4 Otherwise, you are still stuck, as law of the case, with 5 that particular information. If new facts came in - 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even with the original 7 judge? 8 MR. PARRISH: Even with the original judge. 9 Absolutely, Justice Scalia. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless there are new facts 11 or some -- some new - 12 MR. PARRISH: New facts, a change in 13 controlling law, or other factor. It's a basic concept, 14 and that's why a lot of cases are not floating around 15 about that. Plus the government - 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm -- I'm a 17 little confused. 18 MR. PARRISH: Sure. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought that the 20 entire premise of Booker was that judges should have 21 full discretion under 3553 to balance the factors that 22 are required by the statute to be balanced and to come 23 to what they believe is the appropriate sentence. 24 If we impose, in a resentencing, in a remand 25 order that has vacated a prior sentence, a limitation on
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that power, don't we in turn do exactly what you're 2 arguing in your first half of your appeal, which is 3 unconstitutionally tie the hands of the judge? I think 4 that was what Justice -- the Chief Justice was getting 5 to in his first question. 6 MR. PARRISH: That's absolutely -- that's 7 why they are apples and oranges. If you go to the 8 Booker decision with regard to Mr. Pepper -- and Mr. 9 Pepper's decision is under the remedial remedy that we 10 are asking that you impose in this case -- Mr. Pepper's 11 case is still on direct appeal. 12 As a matter of fact, if the restrictions 13 placed upon 3742(g)(2), if they remained, Mr. Booker 14 would not have gotten the advantage of the remedial 15 ruling in the case. Actually, he was entitled to it as 16 part of the Sixth Amendment. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why isn't a new 18 sentence just that: A new sentence? And the judge, 19 whoever the judge is, can do what they're supposed to 20 do, which is to look at all of the factors and weigh 21 them as that judge believes is appropriate, assuming the 22 remand order is not a limited order. 23 MR. PARRISH: They can look at all of the 24 facts, if there are new facts presented. The difference 25 is, in the law of the case, there were no new facts. In
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 this case, there were new facts to consider, which would 2 be part of the post-sentencing rehabilitation. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well - 4 MR. PARRISH: In that issue, the Eighth 5 Circuit rule that prohibited this was not even part of 6 the 3742(g)(2) statute. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but one -- one of the 8 new facts that -- that is before a judge on remand is 9 that part of the basis for his decision has been 10 eliminated. He -- he gave additional time because of a 11 certain factor, and the court of appeals says: Oh, no, 12 you can't look at that factor. And then he looks at the 13 whole thing. He says: Gee, without that factor this 14 guy is getting off scot-free. 15 You mean he cannot -- he cannot readjust his 16 other discretionary judgments in light of the fact that 17 this additional factor doesn't exist? That seems 18 rather -- I don't -- counterintuitive, I guess. 19 MR. PARRISH: Well -- well, Justice Scalia, 20 under the issue that's presented to the Court, if you 21 mix law of the case doctrine with the 3742 problem, it 22 creates a problem in analysis. That's why they have to 23 be analyzed separately. 24 A judge can look at new facts, even under 25 the remand statute, now that they are restricted to the
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 facts that were part of the first case. That's what 2 3742(g)(2) does. It makes the guideline sentences 3 mandatory on remand. That's the problem with it. 4 If they become mandatory on remand, the 5 problem is nobody gets the advantage of the Booker 6 remedial ruling of it directly, and all sentences on 7 remand are mandatory. Even in the Booker decision, you 8 make it -- which Mr. Pepper was a recipient of, because 9 his case was going on during that time -- he did not 10 ever get the benefit of the Booker decision. When it 11 was sent back, he never did. Mr. Booker, under 12 3742(g)(2), never would have gotten that advantage. 13 And there were several other factors that 14 were coming into play where people would never get 15 advantage of the Booker ruling. 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what do you do with 17 3742(g)(2)? 18 MR. PARRISH: You excise it. You discussed 19 it in the Booker decision. And in the Booker decision, 20 you indicated, Justice Ginsburg, that you excised two of 21 the other -- 3553(b); you also exercise -- excised 22 3742(e), which made the sentences on remand mandatory. 23 In this case, 3742(g)(2)(A) and (B) were 24 left open. And what happens then, the district court 25 judge has to come back. Once they look at the decision,
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 they are bound within those original facts. They can't 2 go outside of those facts to decide something different 3 or to permit a variance. 4 The Eighth Circuit didn't use that rule. 5 What we are suggesting is that you excise that rule. 6 You excise 3742(g)(2) and you excise (A) and (B) of that 7 section. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: Would it be consistent with 9 Booker for Congress to pass a statute that says the 10 following? When a judge initially imposes a sentence, 11 the judge must specify all of the factors that the judge 12 thinks are relevant to that sentence, whether it's going 13 to be a sentence within the guidelines or a sentence 14 that's outside of the guidelines, and if there is then a 15 remand, the judge may impose a sentence based on the 16 factors that were listed at the initial sentencing but 17 not based on any other factors. 18 MR. PARRISH: Justice Alito, Congress could 19 do that. Unfortunately, that's not what they did in 20 this case. The 3742, which came down as part of the 21 PROTECT Act -- in that case, Booker came after that. 22 So, consequently, 3742(g)(2) is problematic. It - 23 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that exactly what 24 3742(g)(2) does? 25 MR. PARRISH: It does not.
11

1 JUSTICE ALITO: It says -- well, under 2 3553(c), the sentencing judge is supposed to explain the 3 factors that justify the sentence that's imposed. And 4 that would -- that means explain a sentence outside of 5 the guidelines; also explain why the judge chooses a 6 particular sentence within the guidelines range. 7 MR. PARRISH: Well, what - 8 JUSTICE ALITO: And 3742(g)(2) says that 9 when there's a remand, the judge may take into account 10 all the factors that were mentioned the first time, but 11 not other factors. 12 MR. PARRISH: Well, Justice Alito, let me 13 give you an example. What if they didn't state the 14 reasons and you go up on the variance from the district 15 court decision saying you didn't get the stated reasons? 16 The appellate court then sends that decision back, and 17 the judge is then bound by those facts. And if they 18 didn't find all of the facts, suppose again they went up 19 on a presumption that the guidelines were, in fact, 20 reasonable. In that instance, you wouldn't get anything 21 for the judge to work from. 22 And, absolutely, they work from facts now 23 within the guidelines. You take the Stapleton case 24 that's in the Eighth Circuit that's cited in our brief. 25 They will increase the guidelines within the guidelines

PARRISH: -- which goes against all of 5 the things - 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the Sentencing 7 Commission -- it still has that guideline that you 8 can -- you can depart -- you can lower within the 9 guideline, but not beyond it? 10 MR. PARRISH: Correct. You mean under the 11 post-sentencing rehabilitation? 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. Is it - 13 MR. PARRISH: They have it as a bar, a 14 policy bar, but the Kimbrough decision really indicates 15 that the courts are not supposed to use that as only one 16 factor. You're supposed to look at all of the rest of 17 the factors. And, as a matter of fact, the - 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But as far as the 19 Sentencing Commission itself is concerned, its position 20 is still that postconviction behavior does not warrant a 21 below-the-guideline sentence? 22 MR. PARRISH: Correct. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That - 24 MR. PARRISH: And it comes right out of the 25 Eighth Circuit, which was not based upon empirical data,
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 like a lot of these other issues are based on that they 2 create as policy matters. But, under Kimbrough, you 3 said policy matters are only one consideration; you 4 must, in fact, look at all the other factors. 5 You also said it in Rita, too. You're not 6 bound by just one of the factors. The court has to look 7 at everything in order to be able to make a decision to 8 be consistent with all of the other decisions that 9 you've written in this area. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that Mr. Pepper had 11 an identical twin, and suppose that Mr. Pepper and his 12 twin engaged in the same criminal conduct. They're 13 charged with the same offenses; they're tried together; 14 they're convicted of exactly the same offenses; they're 15 sentenced on the same day. 16 Between sentencing and the time of the 17 appeal, they -- they rehabilitate themselves in exactly 18 the same way. The twin's sentence is affirmed on 19 appeal, and Pepper's sentence is overturned and he is - 20 he gets a remand for a new sentence. 21 Why is it justified for Mr. Pepper to get 22 credit for post-sentencing rehabilitation, but his twin 23 does not? 24 MR. PARRISH: Well, in that instance, the 25 question is the guidelines accept the fact of some
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 disparity, and there's what's called "warranted 2 disparity." Mr. Pepper did exactly everything that we 3 want a person convicted of a crime to do. He exceeded 4 it. And in that instance, if his case comes back down, 5 it doesn't fall on any concept of unwarranted disparity. 6 There is a difference. There's a difference with every 7 individual who faces - 8 JUSTICE ALITO: His twin -- his twin did 9 everything that was expected of him, too, but he doesn't 10 get any credit for the rehabilitation. He just gets 11 good time credit for good conduct while he's 12 incarcerated. 13 MR. PARRISH: But our guidelines and our 14 laws make situations where people who are unique and 15 who, in fact, exceed don't fall into a separate category 16 of being unwarranted disparity. 17 The -- the emphasis is on "unwarranted." 18 There is some disparity, and if a person is unique and 19 that person does, in fact, under 3353 factors, meet all 20 of the things that require us to look at a person as an 21 individual, that's what we want in our society. And 22 that's what your cases -- 3553, 3661 -- that's what they 23 indicate. You look at the person as an individual. 24 And, true enough, some disparity will be 25 there, but it's a warranted disparity. And it's
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 something that the court can look at, along with all of 2 the other factors. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's -- it's 4 warranted that the one get the benefit, and it's 5 unwarranted that the other does not. I mean, the 6 departure in the case of the one who gets 7 reconsideration is warranted, but that doesn't mean that 8 the disparity is warranted. 9 MR. PARRISH: Well, it would be on a 10 variance and, as you know, under the Gall decision, 11 Chief Justice Roberts, you can look at all of the other 12 factors. Under the departure theory, it's a little bit 13 different. They're little bit narrower, given it's more 14 restrictive, and there's other factors that come into 15 play. 16 Under the variance theory, you have to look 17 at the entire individual. So if that individual can 18 demonstrate that they have made improvements -- not just 19 gone to drug classes but completed them successfully; 20 not just worked as an employee but also excelled and got 21 on a management track after conviction; not just went to 22 college but got on the dean's list and made straight A's 23 -- those are the factors that we want these individuals 24 to have. 25 And that's why 3553(a) allows us that
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 latitude, and 3661, which has a long history based upon 2 no limitation being placed upon the district court 3 judge -- these are the things we want these people to 4 have. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there a guideline that 6 says that there cannot be a departure for rehabilitation 7 after an initial sentencing that's set aside? 8 MR. PARRISH: It's not a guideline. There's 9 a policy out of the Eighth Circuit - 10 JUSTICE BREYER: No. So there's no 11 guideline. So as far as the answer to Justice 12 Ginsburg -- what I thought was her question, that is - 13 the guidelines initially said that the Commission has 14 the power to limit departures - 15 MR. PARRISH: That's right. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: -- but it doesn't do it, 17 except for race and gender - 18 MR. PARRISH: And age and factors like - 19 that's absolutely right, Justice Breyer. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and age. That's right. 21 So under the guidelines, a judge can depart for any 22 reason except those few forbidden things, which I think 23 are properly forbidden. 24 MR. PARRISH: And that's the gram thing - 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes. And -

1 MR. PARRISH: -- the statutory -- the 2 departure from - 3 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and that's still the 4 law. That's still the law. 5 MR. PARRISH: Correct. That's correct. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: And so it's -- it's the 7 circuits that have made this thing up. 8 MR. PARRISH: The Eighth Circuit created it 9 out of whole cloth following the Sims case. It was a 10 policy that was actually adopted by the guidelines in 11 the year 2000. Prior to that, there were about eight 12 circuits that allowed post-sentencing rehabilitation. 13 Now, even under the new analysis, there are about six 14 circuits that allow it. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what would the source 16 of law be to make up such a thing? I mean, what is the 17 source - 18 MR. PARRISH: No source of law -- it's a 19 policy - 20 JUSTICE BREYER: What law gives the right to 21 the -- to -- a -- a circuit, to make that up, would have 22 to say it was an unreasonable thing to do. 23 Now, I guess you could have an argument 24 either way on that, but it doesn't strike me off the bat 25 as unreasonable, where a person has rehabilitated

1 himself, to take that into account. 2 MR. PARRISH: I would agree with you. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: And we would have the power 4 to say that. 5 MR. PARRISH: Absolutely. 6 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about 3742(g)(2)? 7 JUSTICE BREYER: I wasn't going to bring 8 that up. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what we're arguing 10 about. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: No - 12 MR. PARRISH: It is what we're arguing 13 about, not about the policy, because they didn't even 14 use that, Justice Scalia, in making their decision. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may want to - 16 MR. PARRISH: I would like to reserve my 17 time. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- reserve time. 19 Thank you, counsel. 20 MR.

 25 MR. McLEESE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

1 please the Court: 2 There is no valid basis to categorically bar 3 variances under the -- variances from the guidelines 4 based on post-sentencing rehabilitation. That's true 5 for four primary reasons. 6 First, it's undisputed that post-sentencing 7 rehabilitation is logically irrelevant to statutory 8 sentencing factors in 3553(a), including the need for 9 deterrents and the need to protect the safety of the 10 community. 11 Second, the guidelines themselves authorize 12 consideration of presentencing rehabilitation to a 13 limited extent, because it's permissible under the 14 guidelines to consider presentencing rehabilitation in 15 selecting a sentence with inside the guideline range. 16 What the guidelines do prohibit, and there 17 is a provision in the guidelines that does prohibit, 18 the -- a departure from the guidelines based on 19 post-sentencing rehabilitation. The guidelines prohibit 20 that, but the judgment of the Commission about how much 21 weight that factor can be given after Booker in an 22 advisory guideline regime is advisory rather than 23 mandatory. 24 Third - 25 JUSTICE BREYER: Wait. Which guideline?
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 What guideline prohibits that? 2 MR. McLEESE: 5K2.19. 3 And, third, contrary to the suggestion of 4 amicus, there is no general principle in our law that at 5 a resentencing, new information may not be considered. 6 To the contrary, the consistent assumption of the law is 7 that at a resentencing, you take the defendant as you 8 find him as of the time of resentencing. That's clear 9 from this Court's decisions in Pearce and in Wasman. 10 It's clear from the large body of cases from the lower 11 courts cited in Petitioner's brief at pages 42 through 12 44. That's the way the guidelines operate. So there is 13 no general principle that you cannot consider new 14 information. 15 Now, it's true, as Justice Alito's question 16 suggested earlier, that that can result in differences 17 of opportunity, where one defendant will have an 18 opportunity for a resentence and new information will be 19 considered as to that defendant; a similarly situated 20 defendant will not get a resentencing. 21 But that opportunity is sometimes referred 22 to as "luck." First, it can be good luck or bad luck. 23 And to take the example Justice Alito gave of two twins, 24 if you have an example of two defendants who are twins 25 who are each convicted of an offense -- let's say
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 burglary -- and they are given very lenient sentences, 2 and because the judge looks at their record at the time 3 and determines that they are sympathetic. They are 4 don't have a prior criminal record. 5 One of them's conviction, you know, has no 6 claims of legal error relative to his conviction; he 7 gets no resentencing. The other gets a resentencing. 8 By the time of resentencing, it has become clear that 9 that defendant had previously committed several murders, 10 and he has, you know, murdered -- has also committed a 11 subsequent murder. 12 There is no question that, at that 13 resentencing, that information would be considered. 14 There is no question there would be a disparity, and it 15 would be true even if, let's say, those earlier murders 16 had been committed by both of the twins together. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't there a 18 difference between evidence that -- evidence of conduct 19 that occurred prior to the initial sentencing but wasn't 20 known at the time of the initial sentencing, and 21 evidence of conduct that occurs between the initial 22 sentencing and the resentencing? 23 MR. McLEESE: There could be, but, again - 24 maybe going too far with the example of the two twins, 25 if the two twins, while they were serving -- let's say
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 they got lenient sentences but not probation. While 2 they were serving in jail together, they murdered a 3 correctional officer. If one of the defendants does not 4 get a resentencing, if one of those twins does not, 5 there will be no opportunity for that to be taken into 6 account. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: And what's your - 8 MR. MCLEESE: With respect to the other who 9 gets a resentencing - 10 JUSTICE ALITO: Maybe it's all or nothing. 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is. 12 JUSTICE ALITO: Maybe it works both ways, 13 that the defendant doesn't get the credit for good 14 conduct between sentencing and resentencing but also 15 doesn't get punished at resentencing for unproven 16 conduct that occurs between the first sentence and the 17 next -- and the second sentence. 18 MR. McLEESE: That's a possible rule of law, 19 but my point was that's not the rule of law we've ever 20 had. That's not the -- and I should say, nor is it the 21 rule of law that's created by 3742(g)(2), because 22 3742(g)(2) is not a rule about consideration of new 23 evidence. It's an anti-departure provision. It permits 24 consideration of new evidence, and it permits these 25 kinds of -- if you -- disparities, whether warranted or
23
Alderson Reporting Company

1 not, because it permits consideration of new evidence in 2 determining the guidelines range, new evidence about 3 loss amounts or -- or whatever. It permits 4 consideration of new evidence as it might relate to 5 upward adjustments or downward adjustments, as it might 6 relate to criminal history. What it forbids is new 7 variances or departures. 8 So 3742(g)(2) does not implement some 9 general policy with respect to new evidence, nor, should 10 I say, to the guidelines, because as I said, the 11 guidelines permit consideration of post-sentence 12 rehabilitation in setting a guideline range. They 13 reflect a judgment not about the disparities always 14 trumping other considerations, including accuracy in 15 sentencing, but only how much weight that those 16 disparities - 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was that your fourth point? 18 I'm all on pins and needles waiting for your fourth 19 point. 20 MR. McLEESE: No. Apologies. The fourth 21 point is simply that 3742(g)(2), if valid, would 22 foreclose consideration of post-sentencing 23 rehabilitation, but after Booker it is not valid, and - 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If Congress reenacted 25 3742(g)(2) tomorrow, would it be valid?

1 MR. McLEESE: It would be invalid. It would 2 be invalid because it would be -- as applied in certain 3 circumstances, it would unconstitutionally constrain the 4 authority of judges at resentencings - 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? 6 MR. McLEESE: -- and also be inconsistent 7 with Booker. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Because the -- look, 9 the -- that is not this case. This case, they never had 10 a chance to consider whether Booker applies or not, so 11 this is, I think, a special case. 12 But think of 3742(g) in general. It's 13 pretty easy to read that section as applied to instances 14 where a judge, the initial sentencing judge, has decided 15 on his own volition to apply the guidelines rather than 16 not to apply them. 17 Now, in such a case, he sentences the 18 individual. There's then an appeal, and the appeal he's 19 reversed on. What in the Constitution says there has to 20 be a second chance to decide whether the guidelines or 21 something else should apply? What in Apprendi says 22 that? What in any of these cases says that? 23 This is an Apprendi problem. As you know, 24 I've dissented throughout; I think this is bad policy, 25 but -- I've disagreed with everything, but forget that

1 fact, important though it is. 2 (Laughter.) 3 JUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the thing that's 4 worrying me about -- and I don't think -- I agree with 5 you on policy, but what I'm -- what I'm having trouble 6 with is: Is it better under the law to say yes, we can 7 interpret 3742(g) so it can be constitutional, and then 8 if in some cases it violates Apprendi, let the court say 9 that in this case it violates Apprendi. 10 But it just isn't clear to me, which is why 11 I left it alone the first time. It's not clear. So - 12 so -- as to when it is, when it isn't constitutional. 13 You got my whole question there? 14 MR. McLEESE: I do, and to take it - 15 JUSTICE BREYER: And I'd appreciate as much 16 answer as you can give me. 17 MR. McLEESE: To take an example that's in 18 the briefs, if at an original sentencing a judge 19 determines the guideline range and ends up calculating 20 it to be relatively low -- 57 to 73 months, which 21 probably aren't even exact numbers -- and determines 22 that that's an appropriate sentence, and although the 23 defendant is urging various factors as a basis for 24 downward -- for variance from the guidelines, the judge 25 determines that there is no reason to vary because this
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 is a sentence that seems reasonable. 2 So that, although those reasons might well 3 be persuasive in some contexts, they aren't given the 4 range down. The government takes an appeal and argues 5 to the court of appeals: In fact, the judge was wrong; 6 the guideline range is much higher. And so on remand at 7 the resentencing, the judge makes some factual 8 determinations, not found by the jury or admitted by the 9 defendant, which increase the guideline range under the 10 new advice from the court of appeals to a guideline 11 range of 121 to 151 months. And - 12 JUSTICE BREYER: You think that violates 13 Apprendi? 14 MR. McLEESE: Well, if the judge then says: 15 I would like to vary from the guidelines; I am locked in 16 under the guidelines to a 121-month sentence, and I 17 have -- I didn't -- it's true I didn't vary before on 18 these grounds, but that's because the sentence didn't - 19 didn't warrant -- because of its relative lack of 20 severity, did not warrant a variance, I think that 21 the -- the logic of Apprendi and Booker would foreclose 22 constraining resentencings in that way. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm - 24 MR. MCLEESE: And I think that's an 25 answer -- if I just -
27
Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. 2 MR. MCLEESE: I think that's an answer to 3 the question that you had asked earlier, which is, I 4 think, if Congress enacted a statute which categorically 5 said that whatever happens at the original sentencing, 6 the judge has to list any reason that the judge is 7 relying on for a downward variance or departure, and 8 then cabins the judge on remand, that in certain 9 contexts that would be inconsistent with this Court's 10 line of cases from Apprendi through Booker. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, under 3553(c), the 12 court is supposed to explain the reasons for the 13 sentence, even if it's within the guidelines; isn't that 14 right? 15 MR. McLEESE: Yes. 16 JUSTICE ALITO: And so if the court is 17 deciding whether the sentence should be 57 months or 18 63 months, whatever the figures were that you gave, and 19 the court thinks that some factor -- let's say age -- is 20 significant, the court should say: I'm sentencing the 21 defendant to 57 as opposed to 63 because of the 22 defendant's advanced age or young age or whatever it is. 23 Now, on appeal, the -- the court of appeals 24 says the guidelines sentence was improperly calculated; 25 it should be -- the real range is 120 to 125 months.

1 Remand. Now if the court wants to grant a departure or 2 a variance based on age, the court has mentioned age 3 previously as a relevant factor, and it can do that. 4 But if age wasn't -- if age was not relevant to the 5 determination of where within the guidelines this 6 sentence should be set, why is it -- why does the 7 Constitution require that age be a relevant factor, a 8 factor that's open to the judge on resentencing? 9 MR. McLEESE: Well - 10 JUSTICE ALITO: It's just a notice 11 provision. It's not -- it's not something that 12 substantively limits what the court can do. 13 MR. McLEESE: To clarify, a judge is 14 required to state in open court orally the reasons for a 15 sentence inside the guideline range, only if the range 16 is sufficiently large, and the written statement of 17 reasons is not -- the reasons for selecting a sentence 18 within the guideline range are not required to be in the 19 written statements of reasons. The written statement of 20 reasons relates only to grounds outside the -- the 21 guidelines. And to -- from a practical perspective, it 22 would be extremely difficult to expect sentencing judges 23 to list every conditionally or contingently relevant 24 fact, depending on whatever sentence ultimately comes 25 back on remand, that might be relevant to a reason to
29

1 depart from a range that the judge is not contemplating 2 at the time of the sentencing. 3 But I should say also that it -- the answer 4 to this question, of whether Congress could reenact 5 3742(g)(2) after Booker, and it would be constitutional 6 or not constitutional as applied in certain settings, is 7 not essential to our point, because the appeal 8 provisions that were excised in Booker were not 9 determined by the Court -- they were not excised because 10 the Court determined they would be independently 11 unconstitutional. 12 The -- the remedial component of the Booker 13 opinion was focused on the question of, having found a 14 constitutional violation, what then do we do to remedy 15 it? And what the Court said was the way we will remedy 16 this is that we will make the guidelines advisory rather 17 than mandatory. 18 JUSTICE BREYER: The answer to this case is, 19 I don't think, too hard. You say it's at least 20 questionable enough, 42(g) you could say, at least 21 questionable enough that it's the same box as the ones 22 that were excised. 23 MR .McLEESE: And - 24 JUSTICE BREYER: And then there has not been 25 focus in the district court on what the district court

1 would want to do, assuming he is free to apply the 2 guidelines or not, on the remand decision that that 3 judge has never made. 4 MR. McLEESE: Yes, and to elaborate on 5 that - 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? 7 MR. McLEESE: Just -- just by its terms, 8 section 3742(g)(2) is inconsistent with the remedial 9 rule announced in Booker, which was that the guidelines 10 would be advisory rather than mandatory - 11 JUSTICE BREYER: They didn't say -- forget 12 that argument. What I was about - 13 MR. McLEESE: But more specifically - 14 JUSTICE BREYER: I do have another point I'd 15 like to get out, as long as I have this opportunity. It 16 seems to me there's a considerable confusion, perhaps, 17 only from my point of view, but this word "variance" -18 I mean, why is it felt necessary to use the word 19 "variance"? If it's true -- and it's not totally true, 20 but if it's true the judge -- you can apply the 21 guideline, apply it. Now, the guidelines themselves 22 gives you the right to depart in every single case but, 23 for example, a handful of factors such as race, where 24 you really shouldn't change the thing just because of 25 race. So what is the need for the variance?

But are there a 4 lot, many, what -- can you just talk a little bit about 5 it? 6 MR. McLEESE: It's -- two points with 7 respect to that, one of which is this is a provision 8 where the -- the Commission has specifically said it is 9 not lawful to depart on this basis, though it is 10 permissible, again, to sentence within the range - 11 JUSTICE BREYER: It's just a policy 12 statement. Does it enjoy the same status of law? 13 MR. McLEESE: Correct. Yes, they are 14 treated -- in the era when the guidelines were treated 15 as mandatory, they were treated as binding in their 16 turn. There are other guidelines provisions about 17 departures which either foreclose other bases or which 18 will say they are not usually or ordinarily a basis for 19 departure. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I get it. 21 MR. McLEESE: And so, there still is 22 litigation in a post-mandatory guideline system about 23 whether it's a correct application of the guidelines to 24 depart on this basis. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, perhaps

1 before your time is up, you'd like to address the first 2 question. 3 MR. McLEESE: Yes. With respect to the law 4 of the case issue, as it has been framed by the - 5 the -- the briefs by Petitioner on the merits in this 6 Court, it is an extremely narrow issue; and that is, 7 taking as a given that the Eighth Circuit had authority 8 to order de novo resentencing and that, in fact, it did 9 order de novo resentencing, was, at that resentencing, 10 the district court -- the resentencing district court 11 judge bound by the earlier judge's discretionary 12 determination that the substantial assistance provided 13 by defendant Pepper justified a 40 percent reduction? 14 And to ask that question is almost to answer it in the 15 sense that the phrase "de novo" means anew or afresh. 16 And the point - 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it has 18 nothing -- but what if the appeal had nothing to do with 19 the issue at all? I'm thinking in -- the analogy in the 20 civil context, so you have two totally unrelated issues. 21 If you appeal issue B and that's what the fight is 22 about, and you reverse and send it back, it would at 23 least be unusual for judge to say, oh, and by the way, 24 I'm coming out the other way on issue A. 25 MR. McLEESE: And that's true in the civil

1 setting. Courts have taken the view that sentencing is 2 different because sentencing is a relatively discrete 3 proceeding where there are a number of interconnected 4 determinations, a lot of them discretionary based on the 5 judge's assessment, a lot of them conditionally relevant 6 to each other. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But these are not 8 interconnected, are they? 9 MR. McLEESE: Well, the amount of 10 substantial assistance that is given in a particular 11 case can easily be interconnected to antecedent 12 determinations, including what the guidelines level is, 13 because judges are often - 14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my point is that 15 the level of assistance is not in any way connected to 16 the post-sentencing conduct. 17 MR. McLEESE: No, these two issues are not 18 interrelated, but I'm explaining the reason for the 19 doctrine in the -- in the sentencing setting. The 20 greater willingness of courts of appeals to order de 21 novo resentencing and say even though the particular 22 issue on appeal doesn't directly open up the other 23 issues that may have been determined at sentencing, 24 judges in the -- courts of appeals in the sentencing 25 context all agree they have authority to order de novo
34

1 resentencing where they think it's appropriate. And 2 they tend to think it's more appropriate in the 3 sentencing context than generally, because, as I said - 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but why -- why 5 does that matter when you're talking about two totally 6 unrelated issues? 7 MR. McLEESE: Because also - 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no reason to 9 suppose that the court of appeals thinks there ought to 10 be -- or any issue with respect to the question A when 11 they focus solely on question B. 12 MR. McLEESE: I agree. But, again, when the 13 court of appeals orders de novo resentencing, that 14 doesn't open up only substantial assistance. The point 15 is the judge is going to go through and make, as of the 16 time of the resentencing, determinations on the 17 situation as it exists at that time. So, it is possible 18 and not at all unusual that issues that were not up in 19 the court of appeals will come up on resentencing. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you're worried 21 about the general rule, but you agree that none of those 22 arguments make any sense in this case. 23 MR. McLEESE: I -- I agree that it would 24 have been permissible for the court of appeals here to 25 choose not direct a de novo resentencing. That would

McLEESE: I -- I - 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I have never had to 8 sentence someone, but it seems to me, particularly when 9 you have a change in the judges, there's a very personal 10 investment in what you do with the -- the defendant, and 11 to say that, well, another judge looked at this factor 12 so your hands are tied in that respect is -- is a 13 questionable result. 14 MR. McLEESE: I agree. And I should say 15 that the issues that we're discussing are interesting 16 ones, but they are not in the law of the case issue 17 that's being presented here, because, in fact, the 18 Eighth Circuit did order de novo resentencing. The 19 defendant has never challenged the validity of their 20 ordering de novo resentencing. So the only issue is, 21 what does it mean for the law of the case doctrine when 22 de novo resentencing is ordered? 23 And on that question, it's very clear. In 24 fact, not just the Eighth Circuit but every court of 25 appeals that we're aware of to resolve that question has
36

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 said that, as the name suggests, when the circuit 2 chooses, for whatever reasons, to order de novo 3 resentencing, the -- the judge at the resentencing is 4 not bound by earlier determinations of the district 5 court judge. And - 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there reason to 7 suppose when they say de novo resentencing, they're 8 talking about the mistake that was made with respect to 9 issue B and not issue A? 10 MR. McLEESE: No, there's no reason to 11 suppose that. But what there is reason to suppose - 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do they -- is it 13 their practice in some cases to say we're sending this 14 back for de novo sentencing but only with respect to the 15 issue that we addressed? Or do they just normally throw 16 it out and say start over, without any supposition that 17 the district court would take a look again at something 18 that wasn't before the court of appeals at all? 19 MR. McLEESE: Different circuits approach 20 that somewhat differently, but all circuits have - 21 understand that they have authority to make 22 individualized case determinations and they do. There 23 are cases where - 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could they -- are 25 you aware of any case where the Eighth Circuit has said
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 we're sending this back for resentencing but only on the 2 issue that we addressed on appeal? 3 MR. McLEESE: Yes. And the Eighth Circuit's 4 opinions make clear that -- although they apply sort of 5 a default presumption that there will be de novo 6 resentencing, they make clear that they have authority 7 to order limited resentencings. And they do that where 8 in a particular case they think that's more efficient or 9 more appropriate. 10 They explained in this case, by the way, 11 with respect to the suggestion you made earlier, 12 Mr. Chief Justice, that part of the reason they thought 13 de novo resentencing was appropriate here is because 14 they were reassigning the matter to a different judge, 15 and, therefore, I think for some of the reasons that you 16 were suggesting, they felt de novo review was 17 appropriate. 18 But, again, on the narrow law of the case 19 issue that is presented, there is no disagreement among 20 the courts of appeals, and as the name suggests, if 21 there is a de novo resentencing, the matter is de novo. 22 If I could, for just a moment, turn back to 23 the post-sentence rehabilitation issue to make one last 24 point, which is, going one level deeper into the Booker 25 remedy analysis, again, even if there were some -

CIONGOLI 12 AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW 13 MR. CIONGOLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 14 please the Court: 15 Congress enacted 3742(g) for the purpose of 16 stopping district courts from evading the mandate of the 17 court of appeals on remanded sentencing cases by relying 18 on grounds that they did not consider at the original 19 sentencing. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And as far as you're 21 concerned, Justice Alito's question about post- - 22 post-sentencing criminal conduct couldn't be considered 23 by a court, either? 24 MR. CIONGOLI: I - 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because it wasn't a

1 factor mentioned in the original sentence, so you would 2 apply the rule equally to - 3 MR. CIONGOLI: I -- I would, Justice 4 Sotomayor. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any logic to 6 that? I mean, I know that when I was a district court 7 judge, routinely post-sentencing criminal conduct would 8 make me wonder whether this person really was worthy of 9 a lower sentence or not, or of whatever largesse I may 10 have given him or her in original sentence. What makes 11 sense about that? 12 MR. CIONGOLI: Well, I think one thing that 13 would make sense of it is there's a different mechanism. 14 There's an opportunity for that to be reflected in a - 15 in a separate criminal prosecution and a -- and a 16 sentencing for that conduct. When -- when the 17 sentencing guidelines were created and when 3742(g) was 18 passed, all of this was done against the backdrop of a 19 sense that the sentencing guidelines were to focus on 20 avoiding unwarranted disparities, but as the Court 21 observed in Booker, sentencing -- similar -- similar 22 sentences for similar crimes conducted in similar ways. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- when this provision 24 was passed, Congress was worried, I thought, about the 25 situations where district court judges' hands -- were on
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 appeal told you can't use this ground for departure, and 2 often the court, because they thought the original 3 sentence they gave was fair, would then articulate 4 another ground for departure that they hadn't earlier. 5 But didn't all of that go out of the window with Booker? 6 I mean, the presumption in -- that drove Congress was 7 that the guidelines were mandatory. Once Booker said 8 they weren't, why should we be limiting Congress -- a 9 judge's discretion ab initio or post hoc to giving what 10 they believe is a reasonable sentence? 11 MR. CIONGOLI: Justice Sotomayor, I think 12 that the purpose of 3742(g) is to limit the ability of a 13 district court to evade the mandate on remand in 14 sentencing. And I think that purpose was valid before 15 Booker; I think it's actually even more important after 16 Booker if you're going, for example, to have meaningful 17 opportunities for the government to appeal. If a 18 district court can impose a sentence that the court of 19 appeals then finds substantively unreasonable, and - 20 and on remand the district court can then consider 21 grounds that didn't exist at the time of the original 22 sentencing and, in fact, couldn't have been considered 23 by the court of appeals because the evidence didn't 24 exist at the time the court of appeals reviewed it and 25 is, in this case, uniquely in the hands of the defendant

1 to create, then you're going to create essentially a 2 procedural merry-go-round where a district court will 3 impose a 24-month sentence, the government will appeal, 4 the court of appeals will think that's substantively 5 unreasonable. It will be remanded to the district court 6 who will say: Well, in the interim this person has 7 rehabilitated them self, they've gotten a job and 8 they've gone to school. The government -- imposing 9 another 24-month sentence. These are not related to the 10 facts of the case, but this is a different hypothetical. 11 The government will then appeal again and 12 say: This is ridiculous. The underlying conduct is 13 extremely severe; 24 months is substantively 14 unreasonable. And they'll appeal to the court of 15 appeals. 16 The court of appeals will say: We agree 17 it's substantively unreasonable; we're going to remand 18 for resentencing. 19 And the district court will say: Well, not 20 only has he gone to school and not only does he have a 21 job, but he's gotten married, and he has been promoted, 22 and he has been named employee of the year. So I'm 23 imposing a 24-month sentence again. 24 And at some point, the district -- the 25 government is going to say: I give up, because I could
42

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 keep appealing, but what's the point? It appears - 2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but there are two 3 explanations for your hypothetical. One is there has 4 been a real change that affects the judge. 5 The other is where you -- where you began, I 6 thought you were going, where the judge is evading the 7 court of appeals. Those are two different things. I 8 mean, one may happen, and one may not. 9 MR. CIONGOLI: That -- that's right, 10 Justice Kennedy, and I think that both purposes are 11 served by 3742(g). 3742(g), as both Petitioner and the 12 Government -- serves a constitutional purpose. What 13 both the Petitioner and the Government object to is the 14 way that it's drafted. It's not that Congress, they 15 say, couldn't pass this, but that they couldn't pass it 16 the way that it's passed because it makes essentially 17 illegal references to the mandatory sentencing 18 guidelines. That is a product of the fact that this 19 statute was drafted before Booker and didn't have the 20 benefit of knowing how Booker was going to come out. 21 What the Court, I think, needs to decide is, 22 post-Booker, how it's going to deal with statutes like 23 3742(g) -- and there are others -- which stand for an 24 entirely constitutional and important purpose but which 25 necessarily, because of the time they were drafted, have
43
Alderson Reporting Company

1 references to or language that assumes the existence of 2 a mandatory guidelines scheme. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many of those 4 statutes are left that we -- that the Court hasn't 5 looked at? 6 MR. CIONGOLI: Well, I can think of at least 7 three problems that would -- that would result from the 8 Court saying that any reference to a mandatory 9 guidelines scheme creates -- creates essentially a 10 facial invalidity if it's incapable of constitutional 11 review and - 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which are the three? 13 MR. CIONGOLI: Well, first of all, 3553(a) 14 makes two references to -- to 3742(g). And so there's a 15 question as how you would apply those if you strike 16 3742(g). I think that 3553(c), to the extent that it 17 requires a written statement in the context of a 18 departure, starts to -- starts to raise questions. And 19 as Justice Scalia pointed out in his dissent in Booker 20 itself, there's a real question as to whether 3742(f) 21 has any reason to exist after Booker. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: But all those -- what you'd 23 tend to do is take the parts that refer to the other 24 statute and say they don't do anything. And does that 25 ruin the provision it's in? The answer, I think,

1 normally ws no, it doesn't ruin it at all. It makes 2 sense. 3 But this one is a tough one. I grant you 4 that this one is a tough one. And my problem of course 5 is I can think of a constitutional way of applying this, 6 but it's a little far-fetched. And the far-fetched one 7 makes me think that it's unconstitutional in the 8 far-fetched nature of it, and I don't think it has a 9 spillover. 10 MR. CIONGOLI: But, Justice Breyer, I - 11 JUSTICE BREYER: You see, the far-fetched 12 one was the one that was brought out. I mean, not 13 far-fetched. To -- to say in those circumstances that 14 it is constitutional, where they're going to apply a new 15 guideline and they don't have the evidence -- as much as 16 I dissented in Apprendi, I think that one probably does 17 violate Apprendi. 18 MR.

CIONGOLI: I -- I think having a 17 district court articulate its reasons is a good thing. 18 They are supposed to do that under -- under 19 congressional statute now, 3553(c). They're supposed to 20 do it in open court very clearly, and in certain 21 circumstances, they're supposed to do it -- they're 22 supposed to do it in writing. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: They can check a box. They 24 can check a box and the -- unless they're going to 25 depart. Now, the part that's not necessary -- you could

1 deal with later, but the part that's confusing me is 2 where this word "variance" comes into, because I think 3 the word "departure" would normally -- normally -- cover 4 the matter. And then when it gets to the court of 5 appeals, the court of appeals, whether they're inside 6 the guideline or outside the guideline and have 7 departed, reviews the matter for -- you know, inside and 8 have departed or outside, those situations. It says in 9 Booker the standard is to review for reasonableness. 10 But where does this variance business come in? 11 MR. CIONGOLI: Well, I think in the context 12 of 3742(g), that's one of the -- the linguistic vestiges 13 of the guidelines, which is that, up until Irizarry, the 14 Court itself used the terms "variance" and "departure" 15 interchangeably because a variance didn't exist prior to 16 Booker. 17 I don't -- the Court obviously spoke to the 18 question of whether or not it was going to equate a 19 variance and a departure in the context of rule 32(h) in 20 Irizarry. I don't think actually that that distinction 21 was essential to the holding in Irizarry, and I think 22 could be limited there. I think, particularly where the 23 court is trying to avoid invalidating a duly enacted 24 statute, some flexibility in terms of interpreting 25 departure in 3742(g)(2)(B) would be warranted, and you

1 would essentially say that to the extent that a court is 2 varying or departing, that they would need to articulate 3 the reasons. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's true that -- that in 5 all of the briefing in Booker, 3742(g) was not mentioned 6 by any party. 7 MR. CIONGOLI: That's correct, Justice 8 Ginsburg. 9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it wasn't a question 10 of the Court overlooking it. The Court didn't say 11 anything one way or the other about it because it wasn't 12 presented as one of the statutes that would have to be 13 overruled. 14 MR. CIONGOLI: Justice Ginsburg, I think 15 that obviously the Court is dealing very clearly with 16 the constitutionality of it now. And I think that 17 Congress had very good reasons for enacting it that 18 continue to be valid. It's capable of constitutional 19 application, I think, in the mine run of cases and, in 20 particular, in this case. There's no Sixth Amendment 21 allegation in this case. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: But the problem, to be very 23 specific, is I think the following: The first 24 sentencing, the judge applies the guideline. He says: 25 There was $300,000 stolen from the bank. I look it up
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 over here and I get sentence X. On appeal, the 2 appellate court says: You should have counted the 3 securities as money taken. So it's 1,300,000. So go 4 and apply guideline Y. He goes back, looks at Y -- it's 5 a very high number -- and thinks: Given certain 6 circumstances which make this case unusual, I want to 7 depart downward. 8 Now, I would have thought that the judge's 9 behavior in that second instance would have violated 10 Apprendi, because that judge was either going to 11 sentence even without the departure on the basis of his 12 having taken some securities worth a million dollars 13 which was not a fact that went to the jury. So there it 14 is. Or he'd have to throw aside the guideline. 15 But this statute says you can't throw aside 16 the guidelines, and you can't depart for a reason that 17 wasn't previously given. So this statute is -- is 18 forcing him to sentence on the basis of a fact that was 19 not found by a jury. I think that's the argument for 20 saying it violates Apprendi. And I -- I don't see why 21 it doesn't. 22 MR. CIONGOLI: Justice Breyer, I -- I think 23 that in -- in certain applications of this statute, 24 there will be problems. I -- I think that's 25 unavoidable, and I think it's an unavoidable consequence
49

1 of having been drafted before Booker. The question is 2 how the Court is going to address that. Is the Court 3 going to read the statute flexibly? Is -- is it going 4 to interpret it in a way that tries to avoid those 5 circumstances, those constitutional problems? Or does 6 it ultimately determine that it's -- it's essentially 7 not capable of a saving construction. 8 I think it is capable of a saving 9 construction; I think it's capable of a saving 10 construction in a couple of ways that avoid most of the 11 problems that have been articulated by -- by both 12 Petitioner and the Government. 13 The first, which actually Petitioner points 14 out in his reply brief, is in 3742(g) itself. There's 15 this language about "except that," that appears to limit 16 the -- the ability of the district court to actually 17 follow the mandate of the court of appeals. 18 I don't think that that can be read to limit 19 the mandate of the court of appeals, nor do I think that 20 anyone is suggesting that 3742(g) changes the rule in 21 Harper v. Virginia Department of -- of Taxation, the 22 idea that -- that district courts obviously would have 23 to give the benefit of intervening changes in -- in law 24 in judicial decisions. And so Booker, which has been 25 used as an example -- Booker on remand would likely have
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 been entitled to a -- a resentencing, a resentencing 2 based on factors that the district court judge could 3 have considered at the time of the original sentencing, 4 but now in light of Booker, basically a do-over. And 5 for a -- for a small section of cases, I think that 6 would work. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: How? Would -- would you 8 explain, as concisely as you can, why you think that 9 (g)(2) would be unconstitutional in -- in some limited 10 category of cases, and how that can be avoided by what 11 you call a flexible interpretation? 12 MR. CIONGOLI: Justice Scalia, I think I 13 said it would be problematic; I don't think I conceded 14 that it would be unconstitutional. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. 16 MR. CIONGOLI: I -- I think that -- I think 17 that there are some -- there are some circumstances 18 where, by a strict read of -- of (g)(2), the court would 19 be required to apply the guidelines, a guidelines range. 20 And the example that -- that the Solicitor General's 21 Office gave might be the best, which is where you have a 22 circumstance where the district court has imposed a 23 sentence within the guidelines range, has not given any 24 other reason for a variance, the sentence is at the 25 bottom of the range, which may or may not indicate that
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 they thought that the -- that the sentence should be at 2 the low end; and then on a -- on a calculation, there's 3 a determination that the -- on appeal, there's a 4 determination that the calculation was incorrect; and on 5 remand, the district court says: I'm -- I'm bound by 6 this new calculation, and I'm giving you a mandatory 7 sentence. I'm giving you -- I'm bound by the guidelines 8 range because I didn't give any other reasons. I didn't 9 give any other reasons under -- under (2)(A), and, 10 therefore, I can only give you a guideline sentence. 11 And in those cases, the guidelines would be 12 mandatory. And, under Booker, I think there's - 13 there's a question as to whether a court can -- can 14 impose a mandatory sentence in any case after Booker. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but -- I mean, why 16 wouldn't you read that simply to have been overcome by 17 the holding of Booker, that you apply -- that every 18 judge has to apply 3553 factors and decide the ultimate 19 sentence on the basis of those factors? I mean, isn't 20 that what Booker said? And why wouldn't you apply that 21 to -- to (2)(A) and (B) as well? 22 MR. CIONGOLI: I -- I certainly think the 23 Court could take that approach, and -- and, in fact, I 24 think -- I think to the -- I think it should. I think 25 that the Court should find a way to read or construe
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 3742(a) to be constitutional, because it serves an 2 important and independent policy choice that has been 3 identified by Congress. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But doesn't it conflict 5 with 3553(a)(2), that is, the overriding provision that 6 a sentence should be sufficient but not greater than 7 necessary to deter criminal conduct? And the judge is 8 looking at this defendant and says -- a criminal -- to 9 deter criminal conduct and protect public against future 10 crimes: Well, this person has turned out to be a model 11 citizen, and we don't have to keep him in for a longer 12 time to protect the public against future crimes. So if 13 I were to apply 3742(g)(2), I would give him a sentence 14 that is unnecessary to protect the public against future 15 crimes. 16 MR. CIONGOLI: Justice Ginsburg, I think 17 you're pointing out that there is some tension which I 18 have admitted. I think that, again, this statute was 19 drafted at a time when there was a different set of 20 assumptions, and so there -- there may be applications 21 which create some difficulty. They create more 22 difficulty in terms of how it's applied, but they are 23 not the kinds of difficulties that I think are 24 insurmountable. And they're certainly not the kinds of 25 difficulties that support what I think is -- is a

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 proposed broad solution by both Petitioner and the 2 Government, that post-Booker, sentencing statutes which 3 -- which impose a mandatory guideline sentence really in 4 any applications are facially unconstitutional. 5 I don't -- I don't read Booker that way. I 6 don't think the Court intended it that way. Certainly, 7 the remedial holding in Booker doesn't indicate that. 8 If it did -- if that is, in fact, what the remedial 9 holding in Booker stands for, I think the -- the 10 implications are more far reaching than the Court -- the 11 Court intended. 12 If there are no further questions - 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 14 Mr. Parrish, you have 2 minutes remaining. 15 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALFREDO PARRISH 16 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 17 MR. PARRISH: Thank you. I would like to 18 first address the law of the case issue, and that - 19 initially, I said it was apples and oranges, and it is. 20 On two separate occasions after the 5K ruling had been 21 made by District Court Judge Bennett, it was appealed 22 twice to the Eighth Circuit. After it was appealed 23 twice to the Eighth Circuit, they had an abuse of 24 discretion standard they could have used to resolve it. 25 They did not comment on it. They upheld it.

1 Then it was sent back down. After it had 2 come up on an original writ to this Court, this Court 3 vacated the Eighth Circuit opinion, sent that opinion 4 back down. But the law of the case, as you said, Mr. 5 Chief Justice Roberts, still remained with the district 6 court on the initial ruling. The initial ruling that 7 Judge Bennett made with regard to the 5K departure was a 8 separate ruling. 9 Now, the Eighth Circuit, in its own analysis 10 of how you interpret its remand -- we disagree with the 11 Government. They said they -- you look at the analysis 12 of the case to determine the remand. And in that 13 instance, we believe that the remand was the analysis of 14 the case that the 5K departure remains. No new facts 15 came in, no new controlling law came into place, and 16 there was no manifest injustice. She heard no new facts 17 on this case. 18 We believe the Court should reverse - 19 vacate the Eighth Circuit court of opinion case 20 regarding post-sentencing rehabilitation, remand with 21 directions from this Court consistent with an opinion 22 that requires the court to impose a sentence that does 23 not exceed 24 months. 24 And, Justice Ginsburg, we did mention, on 25 page 33 of our brief, the 3742(g)(2) as a footnote, when
55

1 the case first came up. But the Eighth Circuit, as you 2 all know, did not use that rule. They used an old rule 3 that was in effect from the Sims case to impose the 4 sentence. It was not part of 3742(g)(2) or any other 5 statute. 6 Thank you. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 8 Mr. Ciongoli, you have briefed and argued 9 this case as an amicus curiae in support of the judgment 10 below at the invitation of the Court and have ably 11 discharged your responsibility. 12 The case is submitted. 13 (Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the 14 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
