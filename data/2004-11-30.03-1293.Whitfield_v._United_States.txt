2 (10:09 a.m.)

3 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in

4 Whitfield against the United States and Hall against the

5 United States.

6 Ms. Samek.

7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHARON C. SAMEK

8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9 MS. SAMEK: Justice Stevens, and may it please

10 the Court:

11 Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. 1956(h) for the sole

12 purpose of increasing the penalties for money laundering

13 conspiracies.

14 Congress did not intend to abandon the overt act

15 requirement from money laundering conspiracies and for

16 good reason. The list of specified unlawful activities

17 under 1956 is vast.

18 Anytime two or more people conspire or reach an

19 agreement to commit a crime that generates economic

20 proceeds, invariably the discussion will lead to what

21 they're going to do with the money get -- that gets

22 generated, how they're going to spend the money, which is

23 a potential 1957 offense, or how they're going to hide the

24 money, a potential 1956 offense. The Government would

25 charge these agreements as money laundering conspiracies

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 without there even being a single overt act to demonstrate

2 that criminal intent had crystallized, that a money

3 laundering conspiracy was really afoot, and that steps

4 were being taken to launder money, oftentimes triggering

5 substantially higher penalties for the underlying offense,

6 and subverting -- subverting the overt act requirement for

7 conspiracy to commit the underlying offense.

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you just clarify one

9 thing for me? Did they have to prove an overt act in order

10 to establish venue?

11 MS. SAMEK: Excuse me?

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Does the Government have to

13 prove an overt act in order to establish venue?

14 MS. SAMEK: Our position is that the venue

15 provision in 1956(h) for a money laundering conspiracies

16 requires that they establish an overt act and that venue

17 would lie --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, your -- you say the --

19 the statute requires. I'm just asking if it independently

20 of the conspiracy statute -- of the -- the substantive

21 statute itself, how do they establish venue. Do they have

22 to prove an overt act just for the purpose of getting a

23 venue established --

24 MS. SAMEK: Yes.

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- as they do --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the only basis for

2 venue? I mean, I thought the statute provides that's just

3 one of the bases for venue.

4 MS. SAMEK: Our position is that the venue

5 provision in 1956, 1956(i), is the exclusive venue

6 provision for money laundering.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but read it. What does

8 it say?

9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are we talking about section

10 1956(i)?

11 MS. SAMEK: Section 1956(i) is the venue

12 provision.

13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And doesn't it allow it to be

14 brought where venue would lie if the completed money

15 laundering offense that's the object of the conspiracy has

16 been accomplished or anywhere an overt act was committed?

17 Isn't it an either/or?

18 MS. SAMEK: Yes. Our position is that when you

19 read the venue --

20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So you don't have to read it

21 as requiring venue. It's just requiring an overt act. If

22 there is an overt act, then venue will lie, but it also

23 will lie where the completed offense would have occurred.

24 MS. SAMEK: Certainly, but where the completed

25 offense occurs, there certainly would be overt acts. You

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 know, it's inherent in completing the money laundering

2 transaction that there would be overt acts as part of

3 the financial transaction.

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: But why would they state it in

5 the alternative if -- why would they state it in the

6 alternative if the overt act were always required? That's

7 the --

8 MS. SAMEK: I agree that it's -- it's somewhat

9 confusing, Your Honor, but we would submit that the

10 Government's interpretation of subclause (2) is that if

11 two people conspired in -- if two people in Florida

12 conspired to commit a money laundering offense in

13 California, absent any overt act whatsoever, conspiracy

14 would lay in California.

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that doesn't respond to

16 the venue question. Venue, as written in this statute and

17 in most statutes, is permissive. It gives you a choice of

18 forum. It doesn't limit. In -- in the times when venue

19 is exclusive, Congress is explicit in telling you that,

20 but ordinarily a venue provision, as this one, either/or,

21 is permissive. It would be extraordinary to make a venue

22 provision exclusive.

23 MS. SAMEK: Well, this Court has made venue

24 provisions exclusive in the patent infringement context

25 and in the Banking Act precisely using the --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, this Court has no

2 authority to make a venue provision either exclusive or

3 permissive. Congress decides that.

4 MS. SAMEK: And our position is that Congress

5 made this venue provision the exclusive venue provision --

6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I mean, one can understand

7 that if the venue provision just read, a prosecution may

8 be brought in any -- in -- let's see -- may be brought in

9 the district where venue would lie for the completed -- if

10 it just read, venue will lie in any district where an act

11 in furtherance of the attempt or conspiracy took place,

12 then we could argue about whether that is the exclusive

13 venue or not.

14 But I don't see how there is even an argument

15 that it's the exclusive venue when you're dealing with a

16 provision which says that a prosecution may be brought in

17 the district where the -- where venue would lie for the

18 completed offense or in any other district where an act in

19 furtherance took place. How can you possibly read that to

20 say that the exclusive venue is a place where an act in

21 furtherance took place?

22 MS. SAMEK: Our position is that those are the

23 two alternatives for where venue would lie for a

24 conspiracy case.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay, but -- but then --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 then you acknowledge that the place where an overt act

2 took place is not the exclusive venue.

3 MS. SAMEK: Our argument is that the first

4 clause of that provision contemplates the existence of an

5 overt act.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the rule provision

7 for venue, which has not been excluded by the statute?

8 The ordinary provision for venue.

9 MS. SAMEK: The ordinary provision for venue

10 would be that venue lies in the district where the crime

11 occurs.

12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

13 MS. SAMEK: That would be -- in the money

14 laundering context, under our interpretation of 1956(h),

15 that would be where the overt act occurs. So it would be

16 consistent with it. Our --

17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the crime is the

18 conspiracy. The overt act may be an additional

19 requirement.

20 MS. SAMEK: The overt act is part of -- it's our

21 position that the overt act is required, and there needs

22 to be an agreement --

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you will -- you will

24 concede that there are many Federal crimes, conspiracy

25 crimes, in which an overt act is not required. The

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Shabani case requires you to recognize that.

2 MS. SAMEK: Correct. And in those cases where

3 all that's required is an agreement, then venue would lie

4 where the agreement occurs, but in this case, because the

5 -- the offense requires an agreement plus an overt act,

6 it's our position that that's where venue would lie.

7 As a practical matter, if there is -- if -- if

8 this Court construes 1956(h) as requiring overt act, as a

9 practical matter, anytime two people agree to commit a

10 money laundering conspiracy in one district and commit

11 overt acts in another district in furtherance of that, it

12 would be highly unlikely that there would not be some

13 overt act in the district where they agreed to commit the

14 offense.

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're saying that it

16 doesn't mean very much because an overt act wouldn't be

17 hard to prove.

18 MS. SAMEK: As a --

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there are -- I mean, the

20 difference between statutes that say overt act is required

21 and those that just say conspiracy -- there are many, many

22 such statutes, and we dealt with one in Shabani. But of

23 all the statutes that include no express overt act

24 requirement, have any of them been read to implicitly

25 include one, which is the argument you're making that we

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 should adopt here?

2 MS. SAMEK: That's correct. And no. There --

3 we have not found any cases where the Court has heretofore

4 read an overt act requirement into a conspiracy provision.

5 But this statute is unique. The money

6 laundering statute is unique. If you look at the statute

7 and we lay it out -- the statute in total -- in our reply

8 brief, starting at 1a -- the structure of 1956 strongly

9 supports our position that all Congress was doing, when

10 they enacted 1956(h), was increasing the penalty for money

11 laundering conspiracies. As this Court is well aware,

12 when Congress typically writes a complex statute, the

13 statute begins by setting forth all of the offense

14 elements. Here, that would be set forth in (a)(1),

15 (a)(2), and (a)(3). The statute then goes on in

16 subsection (b) to set forth the civil penalty provisions.

17 Subsection (c) then defines the various terms used in the

18 act. Subsection (d) then talks about relationships with

19 other laws. Subsection (e) identifies those Federal

20 agencies that can investigate money laundering offenses.

21 Subsection (f) talks about circumstances under which there

22 would be extraterritorial jurisdiction. Subsection (g)

23 then talks about recording -- reporting requirements, and

24 then you get to subsection (h), which we say, when you

25 read the statute as a whole, clearly intends simply that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the penalty for money laundering conspiracies would be

2 increased to the same penalties as those prescribed for

3 the offense provision.

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that there are other

5 statutes that -- that read this way, which we have held to

6 -- to create the conspiracy offense, as well as impose the

7 penalty for it.

8 MS. SAMEK: Your Honor --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it -- it could do that.

10 Any person who conspires to commit any offense defined in

11 this section shall be subject to the same penalties as

12 those prescribed for the offense. And that could be

13 deemed to create the conspiracy offense and prescribe the

14 penalty for it.

15 MS. SAMEK: It could be construed as a

16 freestanding offense provision --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: And there are other such

18 provisions, aren't there?

19 MS. SAMEK: There are not any other offense --

20 conspiracy provisions that this Court has interpreted that

21 had the same structural ambiguity as 1956(h).

22 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Shabani comes pretty

23 close, doesn't it?

24 MS. SAMEK: Shabani is a separate, distinct

25 statute. 846 was a separate, distinct, discrete offense

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 statute.

2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- like this it seems to me

3 contains no express requirement of an overt act, and we've

4 said, indeed, none is required and that at common law it

5 wasn't required.

6 MS. SAMEK: That's true.

7 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So why would we read it in

8 here?

9 MS. SAMEK: Because text -- as this Court has

10 said on multiple occasions, in order to understand what

11 the words mean in a statute, you have to look at context.

12 So you have to look at where the provision is placed and

13 what Congress meant by that provision and look at the

14 statute as a whole.

15 If anyone -- if we look --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: If you look at this statute

17 as a whole, you don't find the overt act requirement in

18 it anywhere, do you?

19 MS. SAMEK: You don't find the overt act

20 explicitly in the statute.

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the fact that you

22 described it as a long, detailed statute it seems to me

23 cuts against you.

24 MS. SAMEK: No, because our position is that

25 placing it in subsection (h) evidences that Congress'

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 intent and sole focus when they enacted this was the

2 purpose of increasing the penalty for money laundering.

3 The --

4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's get --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: And they were making it

6 unnecessary to rely on the general conspiracy statute in

7 18-371 or whatever it was.

8 MS. SAMEK: It's our position that they're

9 incorporating the overt act requirement, the act in

10 furtherance requirement, from 371 as evidenced by the

11 legislative history.

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's so -- if that's so,

13 then why does the venue provision which you were just

14 alluding to earlier read, except as provided in paragraph

15 (2), a prosecution for an offense under this section. An

16 offense under this section or section 1957 may be brought

17 in -- and then it says -- (2) a prosecution for an attempt

18 or a conspiracy offense under this section. Not under

19 section 371, but a prosecution for an attempt or a

20 conspiracy offense under this section.

21 MS. SAMEK: And it would be an offense under

22 this section because certainly the jury would need to find

23 that the object of the conspiracy was money laundering.

24 So it would be an offense in that respect.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I think that language

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 really cuts very hard against you. A conspiracy offense

2 under this section. It -- it is reading as though that's

3 the section that defines the offense, not just the section

4 that provides the penalty.

5 MS. SAMEK: I can see how you would read it that

6 way, Your Honor, but the offense --

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Only because I'm a reasonable

8 man.

9 (Laughter.)

10 MS. SAMEK: The offense provisions set forth in

11 1956 are clearly set out and enumerated in subsection

12 (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3).

13 In 1988 -- when the statute was originally

14 enacted, (a)(1) and (a)(2) set forth the offense

15 provisions. When the statute was amended in 1988 and

16 Congress intended to create another offense provision,

17 they set forth (a)(1) -- the third sting provision which

18 is (a)(1)(iii). If Congress intended to create an offense

19 provision when they enacted 1956(h), they would have set

20 it forth as (a)(1)(iv), or alternatively, they would have

21 added or conspires to each of the predecessor offenses.

22 Notably, the offense provision at issue here

23 does not include attempts, which 846 did, and which the

24 overwhelming majority of conspiracy subsections include --

25 attempts are included with offenses. The fact that

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Congress did not include attempts in this provision again

2 reflects the fact that they were solely focused on 371, a

3 conspiracy offense, and all they were trying to do was

4 increase the penalty.

5 The placement of the --

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you would expect at

7 least a cross reference to 371 for defining the

8 conspiracy, but there's nothing here.

9 MS. SAMEK: That's true, and it clearly would --

10 it certainly would be clearer had they done so. But if

11 you take the language originally, this provision was

12 proposed by Representative Annunzio to be an amendment to

13 371, and we lay out in our -- in the blue brief at page 12

14 what that amendment would have looked like, virtually

15 identical language to 1956(h).

16 Certainly if you read it in subsection 371 -- if

17 you take the identical language and put it in section 371,

18 there wouldn't be much of an argument, we would submit,

19 that Congress surely intended to include the overt act,

20 act in furtherance language and they were just talking

21 about increasing the penalty for money laundering. That

22 makes our point that you look at the language, and

23 depending on where it's placed in a statute, it can have

24 different meanings.

25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You have given a few examples

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of a word may mean different things in different contexts,

2 but you haven't given any example -- and I don't know that

3 there is one -- where the entire string of words is

4 identical in two statutes, both dealing with conspiracies,

5 and you read an overt act requirement into one and not the

6 other. I mean, you have a much harder argument to make

7 when you're talking about an entire provision where the

8 wording is almost identical than when you're talking about

9 one word used in different contexts.

10 MS. SAMEK: That's true, Your Honor, but as this

11 Court said in Shabani, absent contrary indications, the

12 Court will presume that Congress intends to incorporate

13 the common law concept of the terms that it uses. In

14 Shabani, the defendant did not argue any contrary

15 indications. They argued that at common law conspiracy

16 required the commission of an overt act. That is not our

17 position.

18 But our position is that here there are contrary

19 indications, and because the statute is ambiguous based on

20 the placement and structure of 1956(h), you have to look

21 to see if there are other indications. And clearly in the

22 legislative history --

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but there's nothing in

24 the text of the statute that's ambiguous, is there?

25 MS. SAMEK: No, but that is not dispositive

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 because the placement the Congress has said -- I mean,

2 this Court has said on multiple occasions that you need to

3 read a statute as a whole, and when you look at the --

4 JUSTICE STEVENS: But if you read it as a whole,

5 you can't find any ambiguity.

6 MS. SAMEK: I think you can find ambiguity, Your

7 Honor.

8 JUSTICE STEVENS: In the text of the statute?

9 MS. SAMEK: In the --

10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Reading the whole text.

11 MS. SAMEK: Reading the whole text of the

12 statute, it looks to me it reads that the offenses are set

13 off -- set forth at the beginning, followed by the civil

14 penalties, then procedural aspects, including this penalty

15 provision for increasing conspiracies.

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: None of which mentions an

17 overt act.

18 MS. SAMEK: No, it doesn't mention an overt act,

19 but --

20 JUSTICE STEVENS: So I don't find anything

21 ambiguous in what you describe.

22 MS. SAMEK: Well, we believe that 1956(h)

23 clearly reflects Congress' intent to solely increase the

24 penalty.

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Perhaps that's all they

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 thought of, but maybe they did a little more than they

2 thought they were doing.

3 MS. SAMEK: Well, if Congress inadvertently

4 omitted the overt act requirement, this Court has on prior

5 occasions read into congressional silence terms,

6 definitions that Congress may have inadvertently left out.

7 So in United States v. Taylor, for example, the question

8 was whether or not Congress intended to revert back to the

9 common law definition of burglary in the Career Criminals

10 Amendment Act, and in 1984, the Career Criminals Amendment

11 Act had language that talked about a generic burglary,

12 breaking and entering into a dwelling. In 1986, when they

13 amended the act, they removed that language.

14 The question before the Court then came up what

15 does -- you know, what does burglary mean. Congress had

16 omitted those words, but the Court found that that wasn't

17 Congress' intent. They clearly didn't intend to revert

18 back to the common law, and it was probably an error of

19 drafting and this Court found that generic burglary was

20 the standard. So this Court has done that before.

21 In the -- in the Perrin case, United States v.

22 Perrin, the same thing. There -- words were missing from

23 the statute and the Court did not find that in Perrin --

24 it was a bribery case, and what was at issue was whether

25 or not the -- the statute covered bribery of private

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 persons or only the common law definition where it would

2 only incorporate bribery of public -- public persons,

3 public officials. And the Court said even though there

4 are other statutes that have private person language in

5 it, similar to this case, even though there are other

6 statutes that have overt act requirements in it, we are

7 not going to assume that Congress intended to revert back

8 to the common law and interpret bribery as only applying

9 to public officials.

10 So this Court can look at the legislative

11 history. The purpose is clear. The Government admits

12 that the purpose of the act was to increase the penalty.

13 Prior to 1956(h), money laundering conspiracies were

14 prosecuted pursuant to 371, which required the commission

15 of an overt act. Congress clearly intended to increase

16 the penalty from 5 years to a potential 10 or 20 years,

17 based on what the object of the conspiracy was. The

18 legislative history all reflects that fact, and the

19 Government admits that.

20 The -- as contrasted with 846, which -- in which

21 the public law described 846 in a section labeled offenses

22 and provision in the money laundering context, the public

23 law described 1956(h) as a penalty to increase the -- as a

24 money laundering conspiracy for increasing the penalty.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I -- can I ask what you

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 make of subsection (d) of -- of this provision which says

2 that violations of this section may be investigated by

3 such components of the Department of Justice as the

4 Attorney General may direct and by such components of the

5 Department of the Treasury as the Secretary of the

6 Treasury may direct, as appropriate, and with respect to

7 offenses over which the Postal Service has jurisdiction,

8 by the Postal Service?

9 Apparently there was some turf war going on as

10 to who had jurisdiction over these offenses and -- and

11 this was meant to -- to solve the turf war, but it reads

12 violations of this section.

13 Now, does that allocation of authority among

14 Justice and Treasury and the Postal Service not apply to

15 the conspiracy offenses under section 371? Because that's

16 not a violation of this section.

17 MS. SAMEK: I'm not sure I understand your

18 point. I would think that if it's a conspiracy to commit

19 -- if the specified unlawful activity is one of the postal

20 offenses or one of the customs offenses, both of which

21 carry --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: The offense is never completed.

23 there's nothing -- nothing occurs except a conspiracy, and

24 you're telling us a conspiracy is not a violation of this

25 section. This section sets forth the penalty -- that's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 your argument -- but it does not establish the offense.

2 The offense is established by 371. If that's the case,

3 this allocation of responsibility among the various

4 divisions of the Government doesn't apply to conspiracy

5 prosecutions, which would make no sense at all.

6 MS. SAMEK: It's our position that when Congress

7 enacted this, they were trying to enact a penalty-

8 enhancing statute. 1956(h) then incorporates or impliedly

9 recognizes the overt act requirement from 371. Congress

10 was not intending to change the way money laundering

11 conspiracies were prosecuted. They would have done so

12 under 371, requiring the act in furtherance, and a jury or

13 a judge would find that money laundering was the object of

14 the conspiracy. That's how Congress envisioned this act

15 as -- as being applied, and so I would assume Congress

16 would envision that if it was a conspiracy to violate one

17 of the postal offenses, that the postal authority would

18 have had authority to investigate that offense.

19 Interesting --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you -- excuse me. What

21 -- what do you make of -- of this argument? Let's start

22 with the premise that Congress wasn't thinking about overt

23 acts at all. Start with the premise that you argue from

24 that what Congress was concerned with here was primarily

25 penalty. However, Congress did this in a context in which

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 there are two recognized kinds of statutes, two recognized

2 kinds of -- of conspiracy formulations. And if one has

3 the magic words in it referring to an overt act, you got

4 to prove an overt act. In the other variety, there's no

5 reference to overt acts, and as a general rule, you don't

6 have to prove overt acts.

7 Why isn't it a sensible interpretive rule to

8 say, look, when there are recognized models and Congress,

9 in fact, chooses one rather than another, we're not going

10 to get into the question of did Congress really mean to

11 make a change when it picked one model rather than the

12 other? It simply picked one model, and the -- the

13 clearest way to have a coherent system of conspiracy law

14 is to apply the model. If it didn't talk about overt act,

15 there's no overt act requirement. Why isn't that a

16 sensible way to -- to work our way through these thickets?

17 MS. SAMEK: I -- I think that would be a

18 sensible way to work your way through thickets of statutes

19 that were enacted after Shabani when this Court created

20 that formulary.

21 JUSTICE SOUTER: But Shabani rested on -- on the

22 existence of these prior models. Shabani didn't create

23 them.

24 MS. SAMEK: That's correct, but there is nothing

25 in the legislative history to suggest that Nash and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Singer, the cases that Shabani relied on, were ever

2 discussed or contemplated by Congress. If Congress was

3 going to make such a fundamental change in how they were

4 going to prosecute money laundering conspiracies, they

5 would have said so. We're not talking about a backdrop of

6 not requiring an overt act and should Congress read an

7 overt act into Congress' silence.

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are about -- there are

9 over 50, I think, in title 18 alone conspiracy provisions

10 with no overt act requirement, no explicit overt act

11 requirement. The -- the argument you're making, I

12 suppose, would require this Court to go by -- one by one

13 through those 50-odd statutes, and there would be contests

14 of every one because the absence of those words is not

15 dispositive, as you see it. So you would be generating a

16 controversy about 50-odd statutes that would be gone, that

17 just wouldn't be there if you agreed with Justice Souter's

18 approach.

19 MS. SAMEK: Well, we don't -- we don't believe

20 that's the case because if you look at all of those

21 subsections in title 18, none of them have the structural

22 ambiguity that 1956(h) has, combined with a venue

23 provision --

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have you looked at all 59, I

25 think --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. SAMEK: The --

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and assured yourself on

3 that?

4 MS. SAMEK: I've -- I've looked through the

5 entire statute, and I have not found -- title 18. I have

6 not found any that have both an anomaly, a structural

7 anomaly, and a venue provision that turns on the existence

8 of an overt act.

9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we've already dealt

10 with venue where I think your argument is exceedingly weak

11 since the statute phrases it as a permissive not a

12 requirement.

13 MS. SAMEK: Well, first of all, we would submit,

14 just briefly on -- on the venue point, if Congress wanted

15 this to be a permissive venue provision, they could have

16 said venue would lie where and in the circumstances or as

17 otherwise required by statute, in which case they could

18 have shown that they were applying to other statutory

19 bases for venue, as well as what Congress was establishing

20 here. They didn't do that.

21 The venue provision was enacted in response to

22 this Court's decision in Cabrales, which dealt with the

23 money laundering -- the substantive offense of money

24 laundering, and this Court's suggestion that money

25 laundering could be considered a continuing violation for

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 purposes of 18 U.S.C. 3237, the continuing offense venue

2 provision. If all Congress was doing was codifying that

3 principle and trying to address the issue in Cabrales,

4 they would have just dealt with substantive money

5 laundering in the venue provision. They would not have

6 also included a provision in the venue section dealing

7 with conspiracy. The fact that they did and the fact that

8 they used language that this Court has previously found

9 to --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It gave -- it gave the

11 prosecutor more choices of where to bring suit.

12 MS. SAMEK: We say those are the only choices on

13 where to bring suit. But --

14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you want to reserve any

15 time?

16 MS. SAMEK: Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Marcus.

18 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN L. MARCUS

19 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20 MR. MARCUS: Justice Stevens, and may it please

21 the Court:

22 The money laundering conspiracy statute does not

23 require proof of an overt act for three reasons. First,

24 the text of the statute contains no such requirement.

25 Second, the statute is modeled on the drug conspiracy

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 statute which this Court unanimously held in the Shabani

2 case does not require proof of an overt act. Third, the

3 statute was enacted against the background rule of

4 statutory construction that -- that a conspiracy

5 provision, whose text conditions liability on the act of

6 conspiring only, will be construed to follow the common

7 law, where proof of an overt act was not required for

8 conviction.

9 This Court should adhere to its bright line rule

10 in this case because it provides clear guidance to

11 Congress and to the lower courts.

12 Petitioners seek to avoid application of the

13 bright line rule on a variety of grounds, none of which

14 has -- none of which has merit. I will address a few of

15 those grounds here.

16 First, the money laundering conspiracy statute,

17 section 1956(h), is not a penalty provision for the

18 general conspiracy statute, section 371. Section 1956(h)

19 does not contain any reference to section 371, and

20 petitioners are unable to cite any provision in the United

21 States Code that provides a penalty for an offense defined

22 elsewhere, without also referencing where that offense is

23 defined. Under petitioners' theory, if section 371 were

24 repealed tomorrow, section 1956(h) would also no longer be

25 valid. But there is --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if 371 were repealed,

2 would it affect the actual practice in the Justice

3 Department? I -- I think I recall reading in the briefs

4 for the other side that -- that the -- the United States

5 has continued to charge conspiracies in money laundering

6 cases under 371. Is that correct?

7 MR. MARCUS: Well, my understanding is on -- on

8 occasion that is done in a multi-object conspiracy case.

9 Where there are several objects to the conspiracy

10 sometimes for purpose of simplification, the Government

11 will just -- will charge a 371 --

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: But not in exclusively

13 laundering cases.

14 MR. MARCUS: Generally, no. There might be --

15 there might be an occasional example where it may have

16 been an oversight where a prosecutor may have overlooked

17 section 1956(h), maybe soon after 1956(h) was enacted, but

18 generally speaking no. The money laundering conspiracy

19 prosecutions were done under 1956(h).

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: When -- when you say when there

21 are multiple objects, you're not getting the money --

22 money laundering just under 371. You'd surely charge both

23 under 371 and under -- under -- what is it? 1956.

24 MR. MARCUS: That's correct, Justice Scalia.

25 You could. You could prosecute -- you could prosecute

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 them as -- as separate offenses, but sometimes the

2 Government for -- just for purpose of simplification will

3 just charge one -- one agreement with multiple objects,

4 and one of those objects might be a money laundering

5 object.

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If it were just money

7 laundering, could you charge under 371?

8 MR. MARCUS: Yes, you could charge under 371.

9 There's nothing that prevents the Government from doing

10 so. This Court has -- has held before, for example, in

11 the Batchelder case that there can be multiple provisions

12 that essentially cover the same conduct, and the

13 Government has discretion to choose which one to use.

14 Generally speaking, the money laundering conspiracy

15 statute contains higher penalties. So the practice today

16 is -- is to prosecute those offenses under section

17 1956(h).

18 Another -- another reading there -- another

19 reason they're reading that it's a penalty provision

20 should be rejected is that Congress modeled section

21 1956(h) on the drug conspiracy statute that's virtually

22 identically worded to section 1956(h), and no one disputes

23 that the drug conspiracy statute establishes a

24 freestanding criminal offense.

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is 846.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. MARCUS: 846, yes, in title 21.

2 Petitioners also argue that because prior to

3 enactment of section 1956(h), the Government had to

4 prosecute money laundering conspiracies for 6 years under

5 section 371, that this Court should presume that Congress

6 intended to perpetuate the overt act requirement of

7 section 371 into the money laundering conspiracy offense.

8 But this Court looks, first, to the text of the

9 statute to discern Congress' intent, and had Congress

10 wanted to perpetuate section 371's overt act requirement,

11 it could have easily modeled the text of section 1956(h)

12 on the language from 371 or on the language from any of

13 the other numerous conspiracy provisions in the code that

14 contained express overt act requirements.

15 Congress chose a different model, the drug

16 conspiracy statute, which as I said before, this Court

17 held in Shabani does not contain an overt act requirement.

18 By choosing that model, Congress manifested its intent not

19 to require proof of an overt act because at the time it --

20 because at the time it acted, the background rule of

21 statutory construction provided that a conspiracy statute

22 that conditions liability solely on the act of conspiring

23 would be construed to follow the common law.

24 Petitioners point to silence in the legislative

25 history, but the silence in the legislative history on the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 overt act requirement is not the kind of compelling

2 evidence of -- of contrary intent that would justify

3 departing from the text of the statute and this Court's

4 bright line rule.

5 Finally, petitioners rely on a venue provision

6 for money laundering cases, section 1956(i), which was

7 enacted 9 years after the money laundering conspiracy

8 statute at issue here. That venue provision reflects

9 Congress' intent to identify a variety of districts in

10 which money laundering cases can be brought. It does not

11 reflect an intent to redefine the -- the elements of the

12 substantive money laundering conspiracy offense.

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you make of the -- the

14 argument that I think occurs in the yellow brief, that --

15 the reference to any other district where an act in

16 furtherance, et cetera, took place implies that in the

17 clause preceding, they were referring to a district in

18 which an act in furtherance took place?

19 MR. MARCUS: Justice Souter, I think what --

20 what that terminology was -- was referring to was

21 district. The other is meant to modify district. In

22 other words, the first -- the first clause there provides

23 a venue where the case can be brought. And if it's not

24 brought in that -- if it doesn't fall within that venue,

25 then you can bring it in -- in a different district, an

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 other district. I think that's the -- the best way to

2 read the -- the statute. I mean, otherwise, it could have

3 -- as it was pointed out during petitioners' argument,

4 otherwise they could have just had one. They wouldn't

5 need separate clauses. They could have just had one

6 clause that said, and the case -- the conspiracy case can

7 be brought in any district where an overt act was

8 committed.

9 Petitioners seize on the fact that the venue

10 provision permits venue to be laid in any district in

11 which an overt act was committed. But the rule in

12 conspiracy cases has always been that an overt -- that

13 venue can be laid where an overt act was committed

14 regardless of whether an overt act was an element of the

15 offense. At common law, as I said before, conspiracies --

16 a conspiracy conviction did not rely -- depend on proof of

17 an overt act, and yet venue could always be laid at common

18 law where an overt act was committed.

19 The common law venue rule has been applied

20 consistently to modern Federal conspiracy statutes, such

21 as the drug conspiracy statute, which likewise does not

22 require proof of an overt act as an element of the

23 offense.

24 Congress' codification in the money laundering

25 statute of -- of this -- of this venue principle cannot be

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 read to presuppose an overt act element when the very

2 venue rule it was codifying did not presuppose one.

3 If this Court -- if this Court has no further

4 questions --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: I had just one other question,

6 just out of curiosity, about how important this case is.

7 How many prosecutions under this statute does the

8 Government bring without proving an overt act?

9 MR. MARCUS: I'm -- I'm not aware of -- I'm not

10 aware of a number, Justice Stevens.

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Are there any?

12 MR. MARCUS: I -- I don't know. I mean, it's --

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me quite unlikely.

14 MR. MARCUS: Well --

15 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just wondering. It seems

16 to me sort of a tempest in a teapot, this whole case to

17 me.

18 MR. MARCUS: Yes. I think it's true in the vast

19 majority of cases, the Government does have proof of an

20 overt act. And, of course, overt acts help establish the

21 -- establish the agreement and -- and to convince the jury

22 beyond a reasonable doubt there was an agreement.

23 If the Court has no further questions --

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I do have one and it's

25 not on the money laundering conspiracy issue, but in this

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 particular case, would it be consistent with the position

2 that the Solicitor General has been taking for us to hold

3 the final disposition of this case pending Booker and

4 Fanfan? Wasn't there a sentencing question?

5 MR. MARCUS: Well, it's our position that it

6 wasn't -- they didn't raise that issue in -- in the court

7 of appeals. They didn't raise the Sixth Amendment issue

8 in the court of appeals. They didn't raise that issue in

9 their cert petition here, and so it's -- it's not covered

10 by the -- by the question presented. So it is the

11 position that we've -- that we've set out in the brief

12 that it should not be -- it should not be held pending

13 that -- that disposition in Booker and Fanfan.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's consistent with

15 the position that the Government has been taking routinely

16 in cases where Booker -- where the sentencing guidelines

17 are an issue?

18 MR. MARCUS: Well, I think in the -- I think

19 that that position is based on petitions that have raised

20 the question, I believe.

21 If -- if the Court has no further questions, it

22 should reaffirm the conspiracy statutes that do not

23 contain an overt act requirement should not be read to

24 include one. Thank you.

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Marcus.

3 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHARON C. SAMEK

4 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

5 MS. SAMEK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

6 the Court:

7 Justice Ginsburg, you had inquired about the

8 number of subsection -- conspiracy subsections, and I

9 didn't get a chance to answer your question. Even if you

10 don't find the statute is unique because of the venue

11 provision, as my review of the conspiracy subsections in

12 title 18, there were only about two others out of the 50-

13 some-odd cases that have the same structural anomaly that

14 1956(h) does. So this would not be opening up a can of

15 worms to say that in this case an overt act clearly was

16 intended by Congress and that we need to look at

17 congressional intent. So it wouldn't be -- require -- a

18 holding in this case consistent with congressional purpose

19 would not require the Court to then have to review every

20 single title 18 conspiracy subsection.

21 As the Government pointed out, money laundering

22 cases are not typically prosecuted without the commission

23 of an overt act because overt acts are relatively simple

24 to prove. There's no reason why Congress would have

25 intentionally eliminated the overt act requirement from

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 money laundering conspiracies when, on the one hand, it's

2 easy to prove, but on the other hand, it placed such a

3 critical value in money laundering conspiracies because

4 it's not just that it shows that criminal intent has

5 crystallized and that money laundering is actually afoot,

6 but you're talking about taking offenses, like we say in

7 our brief, where someone pledges a -- a cow for collateral

8 for a loan and then they talk with a friend about whether

9 or not they should sell the cow, and they decide not to

10 sell the cow. Under the Government's theory, they

11 couldn't be prosecuted for defrauding the Government

12 because, in fact, they never sold the cow. They couldn't

13 be prosecuted for conspiracy to defraud the Government

14 because they didn't commit an overt act in furtherance of

15 defrauding the Government. They couldn't be convicted or

16 prosecuted for money laundering because they never sold

17 the cow, so there were never any proceeds to generate.

18 But they could be convicted, under the Government's

19 theory, of conspiracy to commit money laundering based on

20 the sale of a cow and their sentence would increase from a

21 potential 5 years to a potential 20 years. There's

22 absolutely no indication in the Congressional Record that

23 Congress ever intended such dramatic triggering of

24 substantially higher penalties without the commission of

25 an overt act, which is not difficult to prove.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Government has said that

2 -- that you have essentially waived their sentencing

3 guidelines issue that you asked us in footnote 6 of your

4 brief to consider.

5 MS. SAMEK: In the district court, there were

6 issues raised as to all defendants as far as various

7 sentencing enhancements. In front of the Eleventh

8 Circuit, one of those enhancements was argued and it was

9 rejected. As to Mr. Hall, one of the sentencing

10 enhancements were argued and was reversed on that

11 sentencing enhancement. But there is still a sentencing

12 enhancement that was raised in the Eleventh Circuit, but

13 it was not raised in this petition. It was not the issue

14 that this Court granted cert on, but we would argue that

15 it's still a valid -- a valid claim and that this Court

16 should hold this decision in abeyance until its decision

17 in Booker and Fanfan.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was the argument below that --

19 -- that imposing the sentencing enhancement was

20 unconstitutional, or was the argument just that the facts

21 didn't support it?

22 MS. SAMEK: The argument was that the facts

23 didn't support it.

24 Finally, Your Honor, we would -- Your Honors, we

25 would just again say that Congress did not intend to cause

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 a dramatic change in the way money laundering conspiracies

2 were prosecuted. This Court has said in other cases that

3 when Congress intends dramatic changes, that you would

4 expect to find something in the legislative history. The

5 Court has said that in the Lewis case having to do with

6 interstate gambling and -- I see my time is up. Thank

7 you.
