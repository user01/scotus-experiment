3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:28 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 11-199, Vasquez v. United 5 States. 6 Mr. Brindley. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BEAU B. BRINDLEY 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. BRINDLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 When determining whether an error affects 12 substantial rights pursuant to the harmless-error 13 statute, courts should first begin the analysis with the 14 error itself, consider it in the context of the entire 15 record, determine what potential impact it may have, and 16 then ask the question: Can the government prove to the 17 requisite degree of certitude -- in this case, fair 18 assurance -- that the error did not substantially impact 19 the verdict of the jury that heard the case? 20 It is impermissible for the reviewing court 21 to merely ask the question of whether some other jury, a 22 reasonable jury that didn't hear the error that this 23 jury heard, would convict him and determine harmlessness 24 on that basis. 25 Kotteakos --

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: My problem --

4

2 MR. BRINDLEY: Yes.

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is I can accept that

4 formulation certainly for purposes of this case. I just

5 don't see where in the opinion -- I have the opinion of

6 the court of appeals -- it focused on the wrong test.

7 It didn't use the magic words, and it

8 started out with let's look at the big picture, and it

9 said, well, here's the defense he elected to put on, and

10 this is a tough sell because. But then it quotes what

11 happens with the jury. It -- and it -- and it ends its

12 analysis for -- saying: We -- this evidence would have

13 moved the jury to convict Vasquez without a nudge from

14 anything it heard in the government's case.

15 I just -- I just don't see that you have

16 supported your theory by what the -- by what the court

17 says.

18 MR. BRINDLEY: Before the harmless-error

19 analysis, the question the Court asks is, what we have

20 to decide is whether a reasonable jury would convict him

21 absent the error. And so, the question that they ask

22 doesn't require any consideration of the error. And the

23 conclusion they reach that he would be convicted without

24 any consideration of the error also doesn't consider the

25 error.

5 1 They do not address the error or its impact 2 at all, despite a robust dissent, which set forth the 3 extraordinary prejudicial possible impact of this error. 4 They don't disagree with the dissent; they simply don't 5 address it at all. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what 7 the error actually was? I see -- and you can add 8 another -- three potential things about these calls or 9 three potential errors: One, that they proved as a 10 matter of fact that she was biased. But, as the 11 majority points out, she already said she was before the 12 tapes were played. So, whatever error may have been 13 occasioned by the jury using the tapes as for the truth, 14 it really was cumulative to an already admitted bias. 15 The second is some sort of ambiguous 16 statement by her that all of them were in trouble, 17 meaning all the defendants, and a similar statement by 18 the -- by Petitioner's lawyer. So, what was it that was 19 error that affected or influenced the jury among these 20 three choices? 21 MR. BRINDLEY: The -- the statements from 22 counsel, two statements: One, that everyone was going 23 to lose the case, which was repeated several times by 24 government counsel during the cross-examination of Ms. 25 Perez.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
6 1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It was never referenced 2 in the summations, however, or in the reply. 3 MR. BRINDLEY: They were not specific -- the 4 recordings were referenced, and they told them to look 5 at the recordings. They didn't reference that specific 6 statement. It was referenced three times in the 7 cross-examination. When the witness suggested that 8 it -- who was going to lose the case only referred to 9 her husband, the government corrected her and said, no, 10 it was everyone. And then they played the tape to make 11 that clear. 12 They also played a portion of a recording 13 where it said that counsel was talking to Mr. Vasquez 14 about pleading guilty. Now, if you take those two 15 statements together for their truth, what they mean is 16 that counsel believes he's guilty and was telling him he 17 should plead that way. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, that's the error 19 that you think -20 MR. BRINDLEY: I think that's -21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- influenced this 22 trial? 23 MR. BRINDLEY: I think that's the most 24 substantial one. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Now, tell me
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 what in this record reflects that influence.

7

2 MR. BRINDLEY: Well --

3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The fact that they asked

4 for her testimony -- well, she was your client's entire

5 defense. So, what does the asking for her testimony

6 show that they were interested in that particular part

7 of the transcript?

8 MR. BRINDLEY: Well, asking for her

9 testimony shows that they were focused on the -- they

10 were asking for a transcript that would have contained

11 that part of the record. We don't -- we can't prove,

12 and we don't have the burden -- I think that's

13 important -- to prove that she -- they were focused on

14 that specific statement. However, they did ask for that

15 transcript.

16 I also think they rendered the split verdict

17 in the case, which is --

18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which transcript? The

19 transcript of her testimony?

20 MR. BRINDLEY: Her testimonies, both on

21 direct -- and then they asked for both, plural,

22 indicating they wanted the rebuttal testimony, which

23 would have included these statements.

24 And I don't think there's any way for the

25 government to prove on this record to any degree of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 assurance that they weren't concerned about that error,

8

2 an error that I think if they took these things for

3 their truth, then they could have thought he essentially

4 confessed to his lawyer. His lawyer knew he was guilty.

5 Those are fair inferences if taken for their truth. And

6 then they could have disregarded all arguments that were

7 made on his behalf. That's a sort of error that could

8 infect the entire proceeding.

9 And when you ask --

10 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it correct that the

11 difference between your position and the Government's

12 position is that the Government says the focus should be

13 on a rational jury, and you say the focus should be on

14 this particular jury?

15 MR. BRINDLEY: That is one of the important

16 differences. I think --

17 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that I understand.

18 But beyond that I really don't understand the difference

19 between the two positions.

20 MR. BRINDLEY: I -- well, in the

21 Government's brief, at some times, as we indicate in our

22 reply, it seems that they support a very similar test to

23 ours, and at others, it seems like they want to say that

24 you can just look at a reasonable jury and how they

25 would view the evidence.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
9 1 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me -- let me read 2 you two sentences and tell me whether you think there's 3 a difference between them. First one: "Is there a fair 4 possibility that this particular evidence caused the 5 jury to convict?" Second statement: "Is there a fair 6 possibility that this jury would have" -- "that this 7 jury would have convicted without the evidence?" 8 Do you see a difference between those two? 9 MR. BRINDLEY: I do. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference? 11 MR. BRINDLEY: The difference is one of them 12 was going to focus on the entire record, which includes 13 the error. The other is going to focus on the evidence 14 in the record without the error, and that's important, 15 particularly with an error like this, an error that 16 could have a pernicious effect that could affect a 17 large, substantial part of this evidence, everything the 18 defendant presented. It's really -19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I -20 MR. BRINDLEY: Yes. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- stop you there? 22 I -- where in the Government's brief do you 23 see the statement that the analysis should not look to 24 the error, should not include the error? 25 MR. BRINDLEY: Part of the Government's
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
10 1 brief asserts that you can look at whether a reasonable 2 jury would convict him absent the error. That 3 assessment doesn't require a consideration -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where -5 MR. BRINDLEY: -- of the error. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where exactly is 7 that in their brief? That the -- the question is 8 whether a jury would convict him without considering the 9 error. Because I look at the Government's brief, and 10 they have fairly extensive analysis of -- of the error, 11 why they think it's not important, why they -- you know. 12 But I don't see them saying you don't look at the error 13 at all. 14 MR. BRINDLEY: I think there's a 15 significant -- I don't have the exact citation. 16 On page 29, Your Honor, it indicates: 17 "Although the Court's analysis often has not focused 18 exclusively on the overall strength of the government's 19 proof, its decisions demonstrate that a court's 20 determination of harmlessness can properly rest on the 21 conclusion that the admissible evidence of guilt is 22 sufficiently strong such that the prejudicial effect of 23 erroneously admitted evidence can be deemed not to have 24 altered the outcome." 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, exactly. In
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 other words, you look at the prejudicial effect of the

11

2 erroneously admitted evidence and see if that altered

3 the outcome.

4 MR. BRINDLEY: If that's the -- and there's

5 parts of -- the Government's brief, I think, agrees with

6 us in large part on what this test should be. And as

7 far as that goes, I think the problem is the majority

8 below asked a different question and appeared to do a

9 different analysis.

10 JUSTICE KAGAN: What would you point at in

11 the majority opinion below that suggests that they did

12 an analysis that didn't look at the error and its

13 possible prejudicial effect?

14 MR. BRINDLEY: Two things: First, the

15 question that they asked. The question that they asked

16 was whether a reasonable jury would convict him absent

17 the error. There is no focus on this jury that heard

18 the case or this verdict. And --

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Where -- where is that

20 statement? Where is that statement?

21 MR. BRINDLEY: In the -- you mean in the

22 majority opinion?

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

24 MR. BRINDLEY: It's immediately prior to the

25 harmless-error analysis.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
12 1 If we go to page 16A of the appendix to our 2 cert petition, it states at the bottom of that first 3 paragraph: "On appeal, the burden lies on the 4 government to prove that a reasonable jury would have 5 reached the same verdict without the challenged 6 evidence." 7 That's the question they're asking. That 8 question doesn't -9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but in the context 10 of the opinion -- and this was my first question -- they 11 then proceed to analyze -- and that's toward the very 12 end of its discussion -- what happened in this 13 particular case. And it concludes, from this evidence 14 we believe -- "This evidence we believe would have moved 15 the jury to convict." 16 MR. BRINDLEY: I think the problem is they 17 asked that question, which I think is the wrong 18 question. Kotteakos says you can't ask that question 19 because you can't strip the error from the whole. 20 That's the question they ask. And to answer that 21 question, you don't have to consider the error. 22 Then I think it's important they didn't 23 address the error at all; they didn't address its 24 potential impact, despite that dissent which laid out 25 that this is one of the most prejudicial errors you
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 could have in a trial. They ignored it.

13

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They say --

3 immediately after the sentence you gave us, they say

4 "looking at the evidence as a whole."

5 MR. BRINDLEY: They do say that. But then

6 later on, in that same paragraph, they indicate that

7 here's where the evidence was. And I think it's

8 important that the only evidence they talk about is the

9 government's evidence, and they talk about it in a way

10 that views the evidence in the light most favorable to

11 the government.

12 In their harmless-error analysis, they don't

13 address Mrs. Perez's testimony, and they -- the more

14 important thing is they don't address the error at all.

15 They don't even disagree with the dissent's contention

16 that it's this terribly prejudicial error.

17 Instead, they do what many of the courts

18 below have been doing when they do this guilt-based

19 approach to answer this question. They focus on the

20 government's evidence viewed in the light most favorable

21 to the government and then find, well, he could be

22 convicted on that basis by a reasonable jury.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: You didn't -- you didn't

24 read the whole thing. I -- it's a little hard to

25 understand. And looking at the transcript on page 769,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 am I right? I want to get my own understanding right.

14

2 At that moment your client's lawyer, who they call

3 "Beau" -- is that right?

4 MR. BRINDLEY: Yes, that was me, Judge.

5 Yes, Your Honor, yes, it was me.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. All right.

7 Your client's lawyer, namely you --

8 (Laughter.)

9 MR. BRINDLEY: Yes.

10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- has not yet seen the

11 client; is that right? They think you haven't seen the

12 client yet. They say somewhere you haven't even talked

13 to him yet or -- he hasn't even talked to Beau. He

14 hasn't seen his lawyer yet. They say that two

15 paragraphs earlier.

16 So, is that right, basically, that they

17 think that, anyway? You see at the top of the page,

18 about six lines down: He hasn't even talked to the

19 lawyer yet. He hasn't even talked to Beau.

20 MR. BRINDLEY: I think that actually what

21 they're talking about was whether Mr. Perez's lawyer had

22 talked to me, Mr. Vasquez's lawyer.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, they're talking about

24 the lawyer. All right. And what you're trying to do,

25 as far as I can read this, is they think what you're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
15 1 trying to do is you want Perez to plead guilty. Is that 2 the fair thrust of this? 3 MR. BRINDLEY: There's some discussion 4 between them -5 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think it means? 6 MR. BRINDLEY: There's -- it's hard for me 7 to tell exactly what -8 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, it's hard 9 to tell what they're talking about, I grant you that. I 10 thought they were talking about trying -- that you 11 thought it would be better if everybody got some kind of 12 agreement worked out. 13 And then she says, Perez's wife: "How can I 14 not worry?" He says: "I don't understand what's going 15 on." Which is fair comment. "But it's not the way 16 Beau -- he's putting it two different ways. If he 17 didn't explain to you the way, then, either -- then it's 18 a different story. If you don't ask him" -19 Then she says: "Yes, he's saying that 20 everybody's going to lose. He's saying that whatever 21 he wants to say. I don't believe him." 22 Well, by the time I got through reading 23 that, I wasn't certain what they were talking about, and 24 I thought it sounded like they're talking about: Let's 25 all make an agreement or everybody's going to lose.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
16 1 And -- and I could see that you could say 2 that's prejudicial. I could also see that the 3 government could say it isn't prejudicial. And it's 4 pretty hard for me to read their opinion as thinking 5 they were really not thinking about that error. I mean 6 that was -- or not an error. I mean, of course, they'd 7 be thinking about that; that was the issue. 8 And as I read the opinion, they 9 said, well, there's so much other evidence in the case, 10 and in our opinion, this is weak enough that it didn't 11 -- wouldn't have made a difference and -- and if you 12 didn't, say, take it for the truth. 13 And the other, dissenting judge, common, is 14 thinking: No, I don't know; you know, it's pretty hard 15 to understand what it means, but there's an implication 16 there the lawyer thinks he's guilty of some kind, and in 17 context that might have made a difference. So, he comes 18 to a different conclusion. 19 That's what I saw going on. And I didn't 20 see some big war of standards. I just saw judges 21 disagreeing about a fairly tough question in an 22 individual case. So, what can you say to make me change 23 my mind and think this is a war of standards that we 24 ought to -25 MR. BRINDLEY: Well, because -- I think -- I
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 think the most important thing is what I've already

17

2 said, is the question they ask isn't about the error,

3 and they don't address it at all. And when you consider

4 a dissent with that robust of language, the idea that

5 they wouldn't address it at all is problematic.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, would it satisfy

7 you in your opinion if we said: We aren't finding your

8 opinion totally clear. And, luckily, people don't have

9 the right to send cases back to us on that basis, but we

10 have the right to send cases back to you on that basis.

11 (Laughter.)

12 JUSTICE BREYER: And, therefore, we would

13 like you to clarify whether you do or did or did not

14 take in the actual transcript page there, when you

15 reached your conclusion.

16 MR. BRINDLEY: I don't think that would be

17 sufficient, because I think the important thing here is

18 that they be required to ask the right question, to

19 focus on this jury that heard the case.

20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Brindley, I mean,

21 I guess one difficulty -- and this is really repeating

22 Justice Alito's question, but it seems that you're

23 parsing things pretty closely. If I ask the question

24 whether an error altered the verdict, it seems to me I'm

25 asking pretty much the same question as whether without

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that verdict the -- whether without that error, the

18

2 verdict would be the same. That seems like just two

3 ways of saying the same thing.

4 Now, if what you're saying is put aside that

5 formulation, there are lots of courts that are doing

6 something wrong, which is that they're not looking at

7 the error and its possible prejudicial effect at all,

8 then I understand the argument; but then I ask the

9 question, well, is that what this court did?

10 MR. BRINDLEY: And I think that the -- by

11 asking the question in that way and talking only about a

12 reasonable jury absent the error, when you start saying

13 absent the error and you start looking at the evidence

14 without the error, you're looking at a case the jury

15 didn't hear. And I think that's the biggest problem.

16 If you're looking at a case the jury didn't hear, then

17 the reviewing court sort of makes its own guilt judgment

18 about a case they didn't hear.

19 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, look, if you -- if you

20 win, your client will get a new trial. Let's suppose

21 that the new trial is exactly like the trial that took

22 place. Every single thing is the same except the error

23 is corrected. All right. Isn't that essentially the

24 harmless-error analysis?

25 MR. BRINDLEY: No, I don't think so.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 JUSTICE ALITO: No?

19

2 MR. BRINDLEY: I don't think so, because I

3 think if you do the analysis that way and you say the

4 error is corrected, you don't take into account its

5 impact. The question has been to be whether it

6 contributed to the jury's verdict, not whether the

7 verdict would be the same in another trial. That's

8 where that Sixth Amendment problem that this Court was

9 worried about all the way back in Kotteakos, and even in

10 Neder, where this Court said to safeguard the jury's

11 province, we have to do an exacting review of the entire

12 record including -- that would include the error,

13 obviously, and its impact.

14 And here this court didn't address the error

15 or its potential impact, and I think --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you -- are you saying

17 that it doesn't matter that the verdict would have been

18 the same by this jury if the error had not been made?

19 You're --

20 MR. BRINDLEY: Yes, I am saying that. I'm

21 saying that the question --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying that the test

23 is whether it contributed to the verdict, and if it did,

24 it doesn't matter whether the same verdict would have

25 been pronounced absent that evidence?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
20 1 MR. BRINDLEY: That is correct, Your Honor, 2 yes. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then, what is 4 harmless error? Every error is harmful. Every error 5 that's -- that's there contributes to the verdict. 6 There's no such thing as harmless error. 7 MR. BRINDLEY: I think -- I don't think that 8 should be the formulation of the test. I think it has 9 to have a -- what the government has to be able to do is 10 prove to the necessary degree of certitude that the 11 error doesn't substantially impact the verdict. And the 12 reason I -13 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what does that 14 mean? To say that it doesn't substantially impact the 15 verdict means the verdict would have been the same 16 despite this evidence. But you're saying, no, that's 17 not the test; you have to ask whether it contributed to 18 the verdict. The Government says, well, it did, but the 19 verdict would have been the same anyway. 20 That's what harmless error is, it seems to 21 me. 22 MR. BRINDLEY: I think what the -- when you 23 ask the question about whether the verdict contributed 24 substantially to -- or, I'm sorry, whether the error 25 contributed substantially to the verdict, what you're
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 doing is you're -- you have to then look at the entire

21

2 record and you have to look at the error's impact. And

3 when you do that, you can make a determination whether

4 there's anything in the record that would allow the

5 government to prove to the right degree of assurance

6 that it didn't.

7 Now, you could -- it could be the case that

8 you look at all of the evidence and you can say, well,

9 in light of all the other evidence, the error was

10 cumulative, or it was essentially uncontested. And then

11 you can find that error is harmless. It couldn't have

12 contributed to the verdict, and we know that to the

13 right degree of certitude.

14 I think the problem comes in when you're

15 talking about this reasonable jury and whether they

16 would convict without the error. That's some other

17 trial.

18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could we get a little

19 more practical here? I think I understood your basic

20 argument, which is: My defense was by this one woman,

21 the wife of one of the codefendants. She tells a story,

22 and if the jury had believed her story they would have

23 acquitted your client.

24 MR. BRINDLEY: Yes.

25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, I am

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
22 1 assuming what you're saying -- and you can correct me if 2 I'm wrong -- which is if we believe that the error 3 committed affected her credibility in a meaningful way, 4 that that deprived you of a defense. Is that what 5 you're saying? 6 MR. BRINDLEY: Yes. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Of the potential of 8 convincing the jury. 9 MR. BRINDLEY: Yes, absolutely, in addition 10 to the fact that the error -- if those things are taken 11 for their truth, they serve as an independent basis for 12 conviction, believing he had essentially confessed. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. Now, assuming 14 that's your argument -15 MR. BRINDLEY: Yes. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I go back to my 17 question. Okay? Because what you said to me earlier, 18 it wasn't about believing her or not; it was about 19 believing the defense attorney when -- whether the 20 defense attorney thought the defendant was guilty or 21 not. 22 MR. BRINDLEY: I think that -- well, I think 23 the two go hand in hand. I think that if they take these 24 statements for their truth, they could disbelieve her 25 and the defense attorney who called her because the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
23 1 defense attorney knew he was guilty and then called this 2 witness to say otherwise. I think that would in that 3 situation make it appear as if she wasn't telling the 4 truth. And I think the important thing about this whole 5 analysis -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's -- let's -7 MR. BRINDLEY: Okay. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -- are you 9 taking the position in this case that a reviewing court, 10 under no circumstance, could conclude that this error 11 was harmless? Or are you taking the position in this 12 case that the court here, the Seventh Circuit, I think, 13 committed review error and we should send it back for 14 them to do it the right way? 15 MR. BRINDLEY: I -- I am first saying that 16 the court committed review error. But I think -- I'm 17 also saying on top of that if you do the error -- review 18 properly in these cases, as we've asked the test to be 19 formulated, then what this -- this case is going to come 20 down to is really one question, and -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you're -- and 22 you're agreeing with the dissenting judge, who I think 23 did say this error is harmful. 24 MR. BRINDLEY: Yes, of course. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so, you're not saying
Alderson Reporting Company

1 that it's just that they didn't use the right formula,

24

2 but you would say, given what occurred here, the

3 importance of this witness, that -- that this was a --

4 this was a harmful error?

5 MR. BRINDLEY: Yes, absolutely. I -- I

6 think if you do the test appropriately and do the proper

7 analysis focused on this jury and the potential impact

8 of the error, then this is a harmful error.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: Back to Justice --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is your argument something

11 like this? Let's assume there are 10 pieces of

12 evidence. Evidence 1 through 9 are properly admitted.

13 Evidence item 10 is (a) wrongfully admitted and (b) so

14 prejudicial that that's all the jury looked at. There

15 is a substantial likelihood of that.

16 I think this is your argument: If the jury

17 was so obsessed, focused, transfixed by item 10, which

18 was improperly admitted, what would happen if we

19 concluded that this jury in this case on these facts, if

20 they had looked at 1 through 9, would have convicted?

21 What result?

22 MR. BRINDLEY: I think if you did the

23 examination that way and didn't consider 10 at all, what

24 you're saying is it's possible to convict on 1 through

25 9, but you're not considering the possibility that you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 could convict as an independent basis on 10. And the

25

2 government would have to --

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We're not only saying it's

4 possible to convict, but that likely, probably would

5 have happened.

6 MR. BRINDLEY: I don't -- well, if the error

7 is the error in this case, that's number 10, then I

8 think when you consider the possible impact, sweeping as

9 it might be, I don't think there's any way on this

10 record that the government can prove with fair assurance

11 that that didn't infect the jury.

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, my hypothetical is

13 that the court of appeals says that if the jury had

14 looked at 1 through 9, which was properly admitted

15 before them in this trial, they would have convicted,

16 likely.

17 Now, we -- then the hypothetical is: We

18 don't think they did because this item was so

19 prejudicial that all they looked -- that's all they

20 looked at. Is that what your argument is? It seems to

21 me that's stronger than the argument you're making. I'm

22 not sure even that works for you.

23 MR. BRINDLEY: I -- the formulation you've

24 stated, I agree with that. If number 10 is such that

25 there's no way that they can prove that it didn't impact

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the jury's verdict substantially -- and I don't think

26

2 they can in this case -- then, yes, that's -- that's our

3 argument. And the one reason I think it's most

4 important in this case is because this case comes down

5 to -- at the end, we have -- you know, you have --

6 essentially it's a circumstantial case. This isn't like

7 Harrington or Schneble or the cases with direct evidence

8 where this Court has found harmless error.

9 This is a case where the ultimate question

10 is, if you believe Mrs. Perez is credible, he's not

11 guilty; if you don't, he is. And in order to find

12 harmlessness, you have to have a reviewing court on a

13 cold record making that credibility determination,

14 something that this Court has continually said a

15 reviewing court is not in a position to do. And when a

16 case can be ground down to the point where it's going to

17 come to a credibility determination about a witness the

18 reviewing court did not see --

19 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, maybe the majority in

20 the court of appeals was wrong in its application of the

21 harmless-error test. I didn't think that was the reason

22 why we took this, why we took this case. What I'm

23 concerned about is the test. Now, the only aspect of --

24 the only thing that I understand that really

25 differentiates your position from the Government with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 respect to the test is whether the focus is on a

27

2 rational jury or on this particular jury.

3 And when you say the focus should be on this

4 particular jury, aren't you calling for a speculation by

5 the -- by an appellate court? How is an appellate court

6 supposed to tell whether this particular jury was

7 different from a hypothetical rational jury?

8 MR. BRINDLEY: Because this -- the reviewing

9 court has to look at everything in the entire record.

10 That includes in this case the jury note. It includes

11 in this case the split verdict. All of those things.

12 And when you look at all of those things, you can get

13 insight into the jury that heard the case and how they

14 viewed it.

15 You can also look at how a reasonable jury

16 would view the case as heuristic device to get back to

17 what this jury thought. But --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- I thought

19 your main point -- yes, you said "this jury" rather than

20 a hypothetical jury. But I thought your main point is

21 that what's wrong is to say strip out the infected

22 testimony, take that out, look at the rest of the

23 record, and if the rest of the record warrants

24 conviction, no harmless error.

25 I thought that what you're saying is that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the basic mistake is what -- what are they looking to;

28

2 are they looking to all of the evidence, or are they

3 just asking the question, let's take out the tainted

4 evidence, see if there's enough to convict?

5 MR. BRINDLEY: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. I

6 agree with that. The problem is the question asked by

7 the majority strips out the error and it also focuses on

8 the reasonable jury rather than this jury.

9 And with that, if there aren't any further

10 questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my

11 time.

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

13 Mr. Brindley.

14 Mr. Yang.

15 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG

16 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17 MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

18 please the Court:

19 The harmless-error inquiry, as this Court

20 explained in Neder and prior decisions, turns ultimately

21 on one question: Whether a rational jury -- and this is

22 a quote -- "whether a rational jury would have found the

23 defendant guilty absent the error." Now --

24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Yang, that does raise

25 the question that I think most separates you and Mr.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 Brindley, and it's the question that Justice Alito

29

2 suggested. So, let me give you a hypothetical.

3 Let's say that this jury was not out for 8

4 hours but was out for 8 days. And on the 7th day, a

5 note came from the jury, and the note said we really

6 think that these tape recordings are extremely

7 important, but we're -- we're having a dispute about how

8 important they are, and we'd like to listen to them

9 again. And they do that, and then they come back with

10 this compromise verdict.

11 Now, what you are suggesting is that we

12 cannot look at any of that. Essentially, the best proof

13 that's available to us about whether the error in fact

14 affected this jury's decision, you would have a court

15 close its eyes to. And I guess -- why would that be?

16 MR. YANG: Well, I don't believe our view is

17 quite so firm. I think, as a general matter, our view

18 is that indications mid-deliberation of what a jury

19 might or some subset of the jury might be considering is

20 generally very unreliable. And that, in your case, the

21 Court shouldn't shut its eyes to that question, but what

22 it should do is redirect the court back to the evidence

23 that was before the jury. Because if we're assuming a

24 rational jury, there often is some correspondence; it

25 should be an indication to go back and look again.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
30 1 If the Court were to conclude, wow, the 2 evidence was so overwhelming, so overwhelming that no 3 rational jury would have, you know, had a problem with 4 convicting absent the error, it's very unlikely that the 5 situation that your hypothetical poses would result. 6 So -7 JUSTICE KAGAN: So, let me make sure I 8 understand what you're saying to me, that you're saying 9 to me: No, we didn't mean to say that that was 10 irrelevant; we just mean to say that an appellate court 11 should be cautious about it and look at that kind of 12 evidence in the -- in light of everything else that 13 happened at the trial. 14 MR. YANG: Ultimately, the appellate court 15 should look back at what the jury was supposed to 16 consider, the evidence in light of the instructions. It 17 should be a cautionary note but ultimately should 18 redirect the court back to the evidence. 19 And I think that focuses on, again, one of 20 the two related legal points that Petitioner made in 21 argument that I think there's real disagreement between 22 the Government and Petitioner on: one, the inquiry of a 23 reasonable jury or a rational jury, which is the 24 Government's view, versus this particular jury; and the 25 related claim that the inquiry is how this influenced
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the deliberative process, if it was like a factor that

31

2 this jury might have considered in reaching its

3 verdict --

4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know how to

5 separate out an admitted error situation. And let me

6 explain why, okay? Let's assume the facts of this case,

7 but instead of this tape recording, the improperly

8 admitted evidence was a confession by the defendant.

9 Would you be prepared to say that in a circumstantial

10 case of guilt -- now, we've already said that

11 confessions are one of the most powerful pieces of

12 harmful error -- that in this, in a confession, that

13 somehow this was still harmful -- harmless?

14 MR. YANG: Are we taking Marina's testimony

15 out now?

16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. Yes.

17 MR. YANG: Okay. If Marina's testimony was

18 not in and you had the evidence here -- now, an

19 unconstitutional confession, of course, would raise the

20 bar, right?

21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a different

22 standard.

23 MR. YANG: We're going to --

24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's -- let's talk

25 about it under the Kehota standard. Let's talk about

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the standard we're assessing.

32

2 MR. YANG: If you're -- all you're asking is

3 a fair assurance, then I think you could get to the same

4 result here, because what you -- when you take Marina's

5 testimony out of the picture, there was really no

6 defense at all. What the government had was a strong

7 case --

8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. He

9 testifies, but he testifies to everything Marina said.

10 Meaning, he -- when I used the word "confession," I'm

11 sorry, I misspoke.

12 He takes the stand. He -- or doesn't take

13 the stand. He says everything he said to the police.

14 And that confession that he was there, et cetera --

15 MR. YANG: So, he testified to the substance

16 of Marina's testimony, that he happened to just drive

17 there?

18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: She called him --

19 MR. YANG: Right.

20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- et cetera.

21 MR. YANG: And then the error is the same

22 error?

23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It was improperly

24 admitted. Without Miranda --

25 MR. YANG: The tapes were --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
33 1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- Miranda warnings. 2 MR. YANG: The tapes? 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Uh-huh. Not the tapes, 4 just the story. 5 MR. YANG: I'm a little confused -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. 7 MR. YANG: -- because if he's testifying in 8 court, the government is not putting him on. He's going 9 on as -- there's no Miranda question or anything. 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My hypothetical is not 11 working for this reason, and I understand what you're 12 saying. It's hard to identify a comparable mistake. 13 But my point is that -- doesn't the harmfulness of the 14 error sort of vary with the strength of the government's 15 case? 16 MR. YANG: Undoubtedly. I think that's right. 17 Now, let -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If he had not run away, 19 and the tapes were admitted -20 MR. YANG: We would have a weaker case, and 21 it would be -- ultimately, these lines that the Court 22 has to draw between a fair assurance or harmless beyond 23 a reasonable doubt are guides to reasoned judgment by 24 the court of appeals. The Court has repeatedly 25 recognized that this is a reviewing court's judgment
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 based on the record.

34

2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.

3 MR. YANG: Now -- now --

4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what the defense

5 said was there's only one defense here, and it's the

6 wife's defense that he was there by accident, not

7 intentionally. There was a lot of countervailing

8 evidence to disprove that, but the question is could a

9 reasonable jury have -- might have or could have

10 credited that defense?

11 MR. YANG: Well, I'm not sure that that's

12 Petitioner's view. I mean, I would -- there's two

13 aspects to this case. We can talk about the fact-bound

14 ins and outs of that, which is interesting in its own

15 right. But I think one of the key legal questions for

16 the Court is what's the standard that the Court must

17 apply. And there's a real difference between

18 Petitioner's and the Government here.

19 And that standard the Petitioner has

20 advocated is that this jury, as opposed to the

21 reasonable jury, and that looking at this jury, you must

22 look at the thought process of this jury to decide

23 whether the error might have had some influence.

24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, you look at how the

25 case was tried.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
35 1 MR. YANG: Well, no, I think the position 2 about this jury versus a rational jury, in looking at 3 the deliberative process, is entirely foreclosed by this 4 Court's decision in Shinseki. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Yang -6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you just told me it 7 wasn't, Mr. Yang. Because -- well, I think that the -8 that the reason why this jury versus a reasonable jury 9 is important is whether you're going to take into 10 account what you know about what this jury did: how 11 long it stayed out, what notes it wrote to the court, 12 what eventual verdict it reached. 13 And you just suggested to me that that was 14 fair game to consider in this analysis, although one 15 should be cautious about doing it. 16 MR. YANG: I should qualify that. I didn't 17 intend to give the Court the misconception that we're 18 looking at this jury. The ultimate question is whether 19 a rational jury would have convicted absent the error. 20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, a rational jury is not 21 the jury that I said stayed out for 8 days and sent back 22 a note on the 7th day. That's this jury. 23 MR. YANG: And the reason that I believe 24 that the Court can use that as a benchmark to look back 25 at the evidence is it is some indication of perhaps what
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 the evidence should be saying to a rational jury. But

36

2 the ultimate question is the rational jury.

3 And let me give you a few examples from the

4 Court's case law, because I think this really puts it

5 beyond dispute that the real question is the question of

6 a rational jury, what they would do absent the error.

7 First, in Neder the Court explained that

8 erroneous admissions of evidence or exclusions of

9 evidence, just like an erroneous instruction on an

10 element of the offense, or failure to instruct on a

11 necessary element of the offense as was the case in

12 Neder, will infringe on the jury's factfinding role and

13 will affect the deliberative process in ways that are

14 not readily calculable.

15 The error in Neder was that the jury was

16 instructed not to consider the question of materiality,

17 which was an essential element of the defense. And the

18 Court specifically rejected that the -- that the fact

19 that this jury didn't actually make a finding based on

20 the evidence was not -- did not foreclose harmless-error

21 analysis.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're going back then to

23 your position in your brief where you said that you

24 would not include, in the harmless-error calculus, that

25 the jury requested to hear Marina's testimony again, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
37 1 length of their deliberations, the divided verdict? You 2 said in your brief, at pages 32 to 35, that you would 3 not include those. 4 MR. YANG: That's right. Those types of 5 indications are entirely unreliable and -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought you 7 answered Justice Kagan that you could take them into 8 account, the court could take them into account but 9 cautiously, not give them -- not give them undue weight. 10 MR. YANG: What I think the court should do 11 is when you have a -- what is a much better indication 12 or at least a -- of what this jury might have been 13 doing, you use that as a reason to go back and look 14 again at the evidence. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: I suspect -16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you have a case in 17 which, after the verdict of guilty, there's a motion for 18 a new trial, and it's being heard by the trial judge, 19 and the trial judge said: I now acknowledge that this 20 court committed error in introducing item 10 in 21 evidence. And the court remembers that when this came 22 into evidence, the courtroom was quiet, the jury was 23 transfixed, jurors were weeping. This was the high 24 point of the trial. 25 That's wrong for the judge to say. All he
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
38 1 has to say is, well, I have to ask whether items 9 -- 1 2 through 9 would have been in, and some other jury, a 3 rational jury -- so, that's the end of it. Judges do 4 the -- do what I suggested all the time. 5 MR. YANG: Well, we think that, again, the 6 -- the inquiry that needs to be focused on is what a 7 rational jury would do. And let me give you an 8 example -9 JUSTICE KAGAN: That's starting to look, Mr. 10 Yang, very much like a directed verdict for the 11 government on the part of a judge, because you're so 12 abstracting it from this case and this jury and what 13 this jury's reactions to everything that happened was 14 that, you know, why not just go to the directed verdict 15 route? 16 MR. YANG: This Court has repeatedly 17 rejected that. The reason it's not a directed verdict 18 is you have a jury verdict. You have a jury verdict 19 that beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury has factually 20 determined that this defendant is guilty of the offense 21 charged, on proper instructions. Then the question is: 22 What remedy do you have? 23 JUSTICE KAGAN: You do have a jury -- excuse 24 me. You do have a jury verdict, but you are giving us a 25 formulation of the test that essentially pretends that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
39 1 the jury is not there and that we know nothing about how 2 it reacted to various things. 3 MR. YANG: The reason -4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Sorry. A question mark. 5 (Laughter.) 6 MR. YANG: This I think can be answered if I 7 could just get out a few of the Court's cases, because I 8 think this shows the Court's rationale here and shows 9 that our view has to be the right view. 10 For instance, in a series of cases, this 11 Court has concluded that the unconstitutional admission 12 of a confession, either of the defendant or the 13 codefendant, can be harmless when there is overwhelming 14 evidence such that a rational jury would convict without 15 the evidence. 16 Now, if we're looking at what a jury would 17 have considered, whether they were brought to tears or 18 whatever, when you're talking about a confession, 19 there's no doubt that a rational jury or any jury is 20 going to have that far in the forefront of their minds 21 when they are deciding guilt or innocence. But the 22 question -23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I just don't 24 see how you can do it without the error. I keep going 25 back to this point. How about if the prosecutor had
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
40 1 done in summation the following: Ladies and Gentlemen, 2 whatever the wife told you disbelieve because the lawyer 3 said he was guilty. 4 MR. YANG: I'm sorry. I just -5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The lawyer -- the 6 prosecutor got up at the end of trial and said: 7 Disbelieve everything the wife told you, because the 8 lawyer said the defendant was guilty. All right? I'll 9 go through all the other evidence I have that might 10 prove that she was not telling the truth, but the 11 central, most important piece of evidence in this case 12 about his guilt is that the lawyer said he's guilty. 13 Can you say that this jury was uninfluenced 14 by that error? 15 MR. YANG: No. 16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because under your 17 formulation -18 MR. YANG: No. You can't -19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- a rational jury would 20 have convicted absent the lawyer saying that. 21 MR. YANG: That's right. But this Court has 22 repeatedly said, for instance in Rose, where the 23 question was the jury was told to presume certain malice 24 in a -- in a homicide, the fact that the error may have 25 altered the basis on which the jury decided the case is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 not the question; you look to the reasonable juror.

41

2 Similarly in Pope, the Court said the

3 question does not turn on whether the jury did not, in

4 fact, have this error in mind when it found the

5 defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, because --

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You would -- you would

7 take into account that the prosecution apparently

8 thought this was important, so important. The trial was

9 over. The prosecutor said: Judge, I'd like to come

10 back so these tapes can be introduced.

11 That -- the -- we have the witness

12 testifying that defendant is there by chance; he was not

13 part of the scheme. We have no direct evidence, because

14 Cruz never spoke to this defendant, to Vasquez. He's at

15 the scene, we know that. And an explanation, an

16 innocent explanation, is given why he's at the scene.

17 And then the government comes back, after everything is

18 done, and says: We want the jury -- we want these tapes

19 to be before the jury.

20 Isn't that -- don't we take into account

21 that the government itself thought this was very

22 important?

23 MR. YANG: I -- I think it's a factor that

24 you consider, again, in directing the courts look at

25 really what the trial evidence was. I mean it, I think,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 belies the facts of this case -- obviously, that's a

42

2 hypothetical. But when you look at how cases really

3 develop, prosecutors don't focus on a fleeting, you

4 know, sentence in a series of -- series of long tapes

5 that weren't transcribed --

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But my point to you is it

7 wasn't fleeting if the government says we want to extend

8 the trial so that we can play these tapes, all of them.

9 And they contain not just the one statement. There's

10 the one statement that the trial will be bad, a trial

11 will be bad for all of them, and they all -- that --

12 they should take a blind plea.

13 MR. YANG: I think when you look at what

14 happened at trial, you see that the tapes were played

15 for two reasons: one, to show that Marina had bias

16 because she was told by Petitioner's counsel that

17 Petitioner's counsel -- well, she thought this --

18 Petitioner's counsel would be able to make motions and

19 arguments on behalf of her husband at sentencing.

20 And --

21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The dissent pointed out

22 that she admitted that before the tapes were played.

23 MR. YANG: Correct.

24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That she was testifying

25 in the hopes of getting a lesser sentence for her

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 husband. So, she -- the tapes weren't necessary for

43

2 that.

3 MR. YANG: Well, the tapes certainly were

4 reinforcing of that. And, in fact, when the

5 government's closing argument -- it did not reference

6 anything about this -- what I think you and

7 Justice Breyer correctly identified as a very ambiguous

8 sentence in a series of long tapes. And, remember,

9 these --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was --

11 MR. YANG: -- the transcripts that are in the

12 record are only one portion of the tapes. So --

13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What was your second --

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the line that

15 the government, the prosecutor, repeated three times

16 while she was on the stand, the exact line?

17 MR. YANG: The exact lines?

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

19 MR. YANG: This is --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The government thought --

21 thought it was important for the jury to hear it,

22 because they said it three times.

23 MR. YANG: Well, to be fair, I think you

24 need to look at what's before and after it. The

25 government is focusing on three different statements

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that are at issue in the case.

44

2 The first one is that -- with some

3 profanity, suggesting that her husband is not likely to

4 succeed at trial. The second one is that defense

5 counsel suggested -- that she said that defense counsel

6 suggested that everybody was going to lose. And then,

7 third, she thought everybody was in, again with

8 profanity -- I'm going to paraphrase -- a bad situation.

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Yang, why does any of

10 this have to do with her credibility? Did the dissent

11 say that the way this affected the jury was that it

12 rendered her less credible? I thought --

13 MR. YANG: The --

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that the dissent just

15 said it's bad to tell the jury that even the defendant

16 thought he was guilty -- or even the defendant's lawyer

17 thought he was going to lose.

18 MR. YANG: The reason that this was in --

19 and I don't -- it's not contested here -- is because the

20 argument was made that these statements equating

21 Petitioner and Perez in terms of their level of guilt or

22 their likelihood of being convicted is inconsistent with

23 Marina's subsequent testimony that all of us -- you

24 know, Vasquez just -- or Petitioner just showed up

25 unknowingly because she asked him. That was the theory.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
45 1 It's not contested. And, in fact, nothing 2 that the jury heard in this case under Petitioner's 3 theory would be different. The only difference would be 4 a limiting instruction that would simply say you can't 5 take these statements for the truth of the matter. 6 So, nothing that the jury heard would have 7 been different. When you read the short passage in the 8 context of these tapes -- and the tapes, again, are not 9 fully transcribed. Petitioner asked for the entire 10 tapes to come in at the -- at the tail end of the trial, 11 which -- which was -- based on the government's showing 12 that was uncontested that Petitioner was at the scene, 13 he drove the $23,000 there, he waited with Perez and 14 Cruz while the informant was coming back, he was there 15 when the call was made to the informant that said they 16 had the money. 17 Now, there's some dispute over whether he 18 said that, but certainly he was there when that call was 19 made because that's what triggered the raid. All of 20 that was basically undisputed. You've got all these 21 calls that tie Petitioner to Perez -- to Perez, 22 27 calls -23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're going over 24 the evidence. And I may simply be asking the same 25 question Justice Kennedy asked earlier. But let's say
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 you have a situation where it's the same thing, and at

46

2 the -- you, know, and the improperly admitted evidence

3 has the defendant saying: I'm guilty, I'm guilty. And

4 the evidence is the same as all you've set forth at

5 pages 2 through 9, very complicated, who's driving what,

6 you know, kind of car where, and where they're meeting.

7 And the jury goes out and comes back in 2 minutes: You

8 know, the guy said he was guilty.

9 Is that a situation in which we're supposed

10 to then go back, look at all the complicated evidence,

11 and see if a jury would have convicted? Or can we with

12 a fair degree of confidence say that the error is what

13 led the jury to convict?

14 MR. YANG: Well, I think the former, but let

15 me explain. And again, I'm going to go back to Neder,

16 if I may, for a second. In Neder, the jury never found

17 an element of the offense. Never did. There's no

18 question that the jury's verdict was affected by the

19 failure to instruct. In fact, it was not just a failure

20 to instruct. The district court told the jury this is

21 not for them to consider. And --

22 JUSTICE KAGAN: But critical to the Court's

23 view in that case was that the -- the defendant could

24 not have contested that element.

25 MR. YANG: Well, but if we're -- again, if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 we're focusing on the legal dispute between us and the

47

2 other side about whether we're looking at this jury or

3 what a rational jury would do when you excise the --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I would like very

5 much to know what your answer is to Justice Kennedy's

6 hypothetical and the Chief Justice's. As I understand

7 those hypotheticals, they're trying to imagine a case --

8 MR. YANG: Right.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- where the particular

10 piece of improperly admitted evidence -- we know from

11 how the jury reacted, or the kind of evidence -- it's

12 the kind of thing that could really make a difference.

13 I mean, they were in tears, et cetera.

14 MR. YANG: And --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, in my

16 reading of this, which I once had to read about 100

17 harmless-error cases, and it seemed to me -- and you can

18 confirm or deny this -- that in cases like that, the

19 judge who knows this is a tough case when the jury's

20 feeling this way, asks himself or herself the question,

21 could this illegally admitted evidence make a

22 difference? Could it have made a difference in this

23 case? Could it have? And the answer is going to be

24 "no" where that judge thinks a reasonable jury would not

25 have thought it made a critical difference.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
48 1 And that's just putting the same thing I 2 think slightly differently. But the answer in 3 Justice Kennedy's case would be a judge just isn't going 4 to think it has nothing to do with rationality. If the 5 jury's in tears, they're going to think it's a close 6 case. And, therefore, if in fact this could have made a 7 difference, the judge says, yes, it's not harmless. 8 And if the judge thinks, no, it couldn't 9 have made a difference to any rational person, he's 10 going to say "harmless." Period. 11 Now, that was my impression reading those 12 cases. And I felt that those hypotheticals were getting 13 at that. And -- use them. Answer them rather than me, 14 because that's what I'm interested in. 15 (Laughter.) 16 MR. YANG: The answer is that in a case 17 where the jury -- where you have some very provocative 18 evidence, but there's also a very strong case that 19 exists -- it may depend on the level of certainty that 20 you need to get to, whether it's a fair assurance or 21 harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. But even in those 22 cases, you can -- if the court looks at the evidence as 23 a whole and says that there was so much evidence before 24 this stuff came in, this bad -- this error came in, that 25 a rational jury would have gotten to the same result,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that it would have convicted, then --

49

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose the

3 judge concludes that both this jury that I had and some

4 hypothetical rational jury would have been so focused on

5 this evidence that that's all they would have looked at,

6 but if they had looked at 1 through 9, the admissible

7 evidence, they would still have found guilt.

8 Is that -- is that what you're -- is that --

9 MR. YANG: I think so, but let me give you

10 an example.

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- a proper application of

12 the -- of the framework?

13 MR. YANG: I think so, but it's not, again,

14 what a -- what this particular jury was doing, because

15 we know, for instance, from Neder or in the confession

16 cases, the jury hears a confession, an

17 unconstitutionally obtained confession,

18 unconstitutionally admitted, from the defendant, that is

19 going to be -- right there. You know? A jury -- a

20 juror could say: Let's go home, we have a confession.

21 It's out of his own mouth. There's very little else to

22 debate.

23 But when the evidence is beyond that

24 confession, so overwhelming that no rational jury would

25 have gotten to a different result, and you could say

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 that with a fair assurance or if there's a

50

2 constitutional error as it would be with a confession

3 beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court says that this is

4 harmless.

5 And the reason that the Court's taking that

6 inquiry is because it recognized -- the Court's long

7 recognized that no trial is perfect, that there are very

8 significant costs of retrial. And so, the premise

9 there --

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you are

11 essentially saying, as I understand you, that if there

12 was such a thing as a directed verdict in a criminal

13 case, if the judge would say, you know, I will direct a

14 verdict here because there's only one way a rational --

15 rational jury could come out.

16 MR. YANG: This -- that argument was

17 specifically rejected by this Court in Neder. The same

18 question came up, and in fact, Neder is a much -- more

19 difficult case for the government than this, because at

20 least in Neder, the defendant had the argument that this

21 jury could -- did not find guilt beyond reasonable doubt

22 because it was never instructed to find an element of

23 the offense.

24 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Yang, I think you may be

25 taking a harder position than you really need to. Why

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 shouldn't the rule be that the -- the appellate court

51

2 should look at what would be done by a rational jury,

3 except in the kind of extraordinary circumstances that

4 have been posited by Justice Kagan's hypothetical and a

5 few of the other questions, simply because it's so

6 difficult to determine what a -- what the jury was

7 actually doing?

8 We have a rule that prohibits consideration

9 of what goes on in the jury room. But suppose we didn't

10 have that. Suppose that it was all videotaped, and the

11 jury didn't know what was going on, so you could -- you

12 could watch it and see. If that were the case, then

13 surely the rule would be what would this jury have done?

14 But most of the time, it's just speculation to tell what

15 a jury -- what they -- did they come back quickly?

16 Well, that shows that this evidence was so bad that it

17 caused them to render a quick verdict in what otherwise

18 would have been a difficult case.

19 Did they take a long time? Well, it shows

20 it was a close case, and, therefore, any error might

21 have tipped them one way or the other.

22 You just can't tell.

23 MR. YANG: I'm -- I don't want to resist

24 this too much, because I think we're fighting about

25 things at the very extreme. Most of the times that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
52 1 we're talking about these purported indications from the 2 jury, it's entirely ambiguous. And the -- so, there may 3 be well be extreme examples. And I think those would 4 rightfully influence a court's consideration in a case. 5 But, again, when you have harmless-error 6 cases in which we know for a certainty, as in Neder, 7 that the jury did not find an element of the offense, 8 the inquiry has to be, it has to be, on what the Court 9 has repeatedly said in -- this is I believe on pages 19 10 of our brief -- that the focus of the harmless-error 11 inquiry is bringing the court's attention to the fact 12 that the primary purpose of a trial is the factual 13 question of guilt or innocence. 14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you read -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, when you 16 began, if I'm remembering correctly, you said there were 17 two ways in which your position was different from Mr. 18 Brindley's. 19 MR. YANG: Right. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One I understand is 21 that you look at a rational jury -22 MR. YANG: Right. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and not the 24 particular jury. 25 What's the second?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
53 1 MR. YANG: Well, it's related. His focus on 2 the -- this jury I believe is seeing whether there's 3 some influence on the process, deliberative process, 4 even if the outcome would have been the same absent the 5 error. And so, he's kind of trying to get into the 6 minds of the jury. And this Court has repeatedly 7 rejected that. Again -8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ask you a different 9 question, Mr. Yang, which is, you know, this difference 10 in the formulation of the test, which I find it hard to 11 wrap my mind around, but -- and it strikes me that 12 there's two different ways of saying the same thing. 13 But I'm told that there's a fair bit of scholarship out 14 there which suggests that courts that use one 15 formulation tend to come out one way, and courts that 16 use the other formulation tend to come out the other 17 way. 18 And I'm just wondering what your view of 19 that is, that somehow one formulation seems to put the 20 emphasis on the entire case, whereas the other 21 formulation seems to put the emphasis on only the 22 government's evidence, and that that makes a difference 23 in the end. 24 MR. YANG: We don't think that there is this 25 deep -- there are some disagreements or some things we
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 disagree with about what courts of appeals do in any

54

2 particular cases. But with respect to this formulation

3 of the -- I think Petitioner calls it the guilt-focused

4 versus effect-of-the-error-focused approaches, the

5 scholarship -- I think he relies principally on Judge

6 Edwards' opinion about harmless error. That came out in

7 1995, when it was already swimming against -- upstream

8 against this Court's harmless-error decisions.

9 But he had in his pocket the Sullivan

10 decision, which was admittedly a structural-error case,

11 but there was language in Sullivan which suggested that

12 you need to look at what this particular jury was going

13 to do.

14 Then we have Neder and -- I can't pronounce

15 this very well -- but Recuenco. It's the -- the

16 Apprendi application of Neder, which specifically rejects

17 this kind of broad logic in Sullivan as being

18 inconsistent with the Court's harmless-error cases.

19 Now --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You do agree -- you do

21 agree that the government has the burden of showing that

22 the error is harmless?

23 MR. YANG: Yes.

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's the government's

25 burden. And you also agree that we should look at the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
55 1 evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant in 2 making -3 MR. YANG: No. The Court, even in -- I 4 think most recently, the Court explained in Shinseki, 5 talking about Kotteakos, that you don't use these kind 6 of presumptions or rigid rules. And the reason that you 7 do, that you're kind of looking from the perspective of 8 a reasonable jury, is the jury has in fact found the 9 defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. And then 10 the question is, are you setting aside that verdict 11 because -- do you think that this error was the thing 12 that tipped the scales from not guilty to guilty? And 13 so, taking a look at the evidence, kind of with all 14 presumptions favoring one side or the other, is not how 15 this Court has conducted the -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, what does it mean 17 that the government has the burden? What does the 18 government have to do? 19 MR. YANG: The government has to show, as -20 this is the formulation in Neder and which the Court has 21 said in Neder is the same thing that applied in 22 erroneous admissions or exclusions of evidence, that a 23 rational jury would have found the defendant guilty 24 absent the error, and that involves the three core 25 elements we explained in our brief. And then the Court
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 takes into account --

56

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The absent error. So,

3 that means -- wait. You look at just the evidence

4 that's not tainted?

5 MR. YANG: In some cases you can do that,

6 where the evidence is so overwhelming -- if I -- if I

7 may finish.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Briefly.

9 MR. YANG: Briefly. In some cases, you

10 might do that. In other cases where it's close or the

11 evidence is not so strong, you need to look at the error

12 to see if that error was going to be a dispositive thing

13 in getting to guilt.

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Chief Justice allowed

15 me to ask one question. Could I amend your statement so

16 that you would say a rational jury in all the

17 circumstances of this case, given what this jury heard,

18 would have?

19 MR. YANG: Yes. It's -- in the position of

20 this jury, based on the evidence presented to the jury,

21 correct.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

23 Mr. Brindley, you have 4 minutes remaining.

24 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BEAU R. BRINDLEY

25 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
57 1 MR. BRINDLEY: I first want to address 2 Neder, which Government counsel continually referenced. 3 Neder talks about the reasonable jury, but Neder also 4 limits itself to situations where the evidence is 5 uncontroverted and inconvertible, I think because in 6 those situations the difference between the reasonable 7 jury and this jury would be deemed to be nonexistent 8 because it would be impossible for the error to have an 9 impact. 10 Secondly, I think it's important to note 11 from Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, if you don't 12 consider the error, then even that extreme case, that 13 would have to be ignored. And so, I think the 14 Government's formulation and the formulation used by the 15 appellate court below would justify -- would lead to 16 that bad conclusion. 17 I also think that when you do that 18 formulation, where you're talking about the reasonable 19 jury and absence of error, the reason those cases come 20 out different is because those courts think they don't 21 have to address the error, which is I think what 22 happened in the majority below, why they didn't address 23 it despite the dissent. 24 The other thing I think it's important to 25 note is the reason you have to look at the error and its
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 possible impact and not just whether you could be

58

2 convicted on the other evidence is because you say,

3 well, he could be convicted on the other evidence. If

4 that's all that you're saying and you -- and it's not on

5 the evidence which could independently in this case be a

6 reason to convict, then I think you're making that guilt

7 determination that this Court says is not supposed to

8 happen. And I think the majority's opinion below is

9 consistent with that approach, and there's nothing in it

10 to suggest that's not exactly what they did.

11 I also think that in the end -- there was a

12 mention of the limiting instruction; a limiting

13 instruction would have cured this problem. We assume

14 juries would follow it. That means they wouldn't have

15 concluded that his lawyer thought him guilty and then

16 put Mrs. Perez on the stand and concluded she wasn't

17 telling the truth.

18 What this error allows, what -- if taken for

19 its truth, a jury could believe that he confessed to his

20 lawyer. They could disregard everything that was said

21 on his behalf. They could say we know that he's guilty;

22 his lawyer knew he was guilty; we can convict him on

23 that basis. That's an error that can infect the

24 entirety of the proceedings.

25 And if you look at this jury and what they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
59 1 heard, and the question comes down to whether Mrs. Perez 2 is credible or not, there is nothing in this record the 3 Government can point to that would allow a reviewing 4 court to make that determination. A reviewing court 5 that didn't see -6 JUSTICE ALITO: Did the panel majority in -7 did the panel majority in this case say anything that 8 differs from what this Court has said about harmless 9 error? If we were to reverse, what would we point to in 10 the panel majority's opinion that was erroneous? 11 MR. BRINDLEY: I think you would point to 12 that first statement of the test where they say whether 13 the reasonable jury would convict him absent the error, 14 because Kotteakos says you can't strip the error out. 15 This Court has never overruled Kotteakos. 16 The other thing -17 JUSTICE ALITO: Hasn't this Court said 18 exactly what Seventh Circuit said there? In other 19 cases? 20 MR. BRINDLEY: This Court has used, I think, 21 dicta that has language of that sort. But in those 22 cases, what the Court does -- like in Harrington, they 23 look at what the error was; they put it in the context 24 of the whole case, and they can say the government could 25 prove the jury didn't look at this to the right degree
Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1 of assurance, because it was cumulative, because --

60

2 there's no -- there's nothing --

3 JUSTICE ALITO: You want us to say -- you

4 want us to say we're reversing you, Seventh Circuit

5 panel, because you said what we have said in prior

6 cases, but we were wrong?

7 MR. BRINDLEY: I think the reason to reverse

8 them is because that formulation has proven to lead to

9 the wrong analysis, in all of these lower courts, this

10 guilt-based approach; and it is not the law of

11 Kotteakos. This Court has never overruled Kotteakos.

12 And to focus on it allows a guilt

13 determination by a reviewing court that would be

14 violative of the Sixth Amendment that this Court was

15 concerned about in Kotteakos, that this Court was

16 concerned about in Sullivan, that this Court was even

17 concerned about in Neder, outside the scope of cases

18 where the evidence is uncontestable.

19 Because if you took these statements as true

20 and then you came down to a question, well, is Marina

21 credible or not, Mrs. Perez, there's nothing the

22 government can do on this record to prove that the jury

23 would have found her credibility differently because

24 this Court can't figure that out on a cold record.

25 It said so, many times. It's not possible
