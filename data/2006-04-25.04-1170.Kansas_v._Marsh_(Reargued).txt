5 General Kline.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILL KLINE

7 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8 MR. KLINE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:

10 This Court has never held that a specific

11 method of weighing aggravating and mitigating evidence

12 is required, yet in its individualized sentencing line

13 of cases this Court has consistently said that all the

14 Eighth Amendment requires is that a juror consider and

15 give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence. In

16 pages 23 through 28 of your appendix, you will find

17 the Kansas jury instructions and Kansas law clearly,

18 on four occasions, instruct individual jurors that they

19 must individually consider all mitigating evidence that

20 they find. Furthermore, the jurors are instructed in

21 five different methods in which they can give that

22 mitigating evidence the effect of a life sentence, and

23 only one manner in which, acting unanimously and after

24 the State has met the highest burden allowed by law in

25 three separate measurements, beyond a reasonable doubt

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

3

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 demonstrated that the death sentence is appropriate.

2 Specifically, instruction number 4, paragraph

3 2 on page 24 of the joint appendix, will show the

4 jurors are instructed that mercy, in and of itself, is

5 a mitigating piece of evidence, and later, in the

6 instruction that lays out the mitigating evidence

7 presented in this specific case, they are told, in

8 paragraph 18 on page 26 of your joint appendix, that

9 mercy, by itself, can be sufficient to warrant a

10 sentence other than death.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I'm sorry, what

12 instruction is that?

13 MR. KLINE: Justice Scalia, you will find it

14 -- first of all, mercy is referred to in paragraph --

15 in instruction number 4 --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: I got --

17 MR. KLINE: -- paragraph 2 -- okay.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that one. It's the other

19 one. It was instruction number --

20 MR. KLINE: The instruction, again, is number

21 4 in paragraph 18 on page --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: I gotcha.

23 MR. KLINE: -- 26.

24 JUSTICE SCALIA: All the way at the end of 4,

25 okay.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KLINE: You will see the instruction for

2 mercy again.

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you began by saying

4 that there's three different measures, I think -- I

5 think was the word you used. And the State, I take it,

6 must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, (a) that it was

7 an aggravated -- or, (a) that it was an aggravated

8 murder, (b) that there was another crime involved --

9 MR. KLINE: Justice --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- sort of --

11 MR. KLINE: -- Kennedy --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- if you could just walk

13 me through that.

14 MR. KLINE: Certainly. First of all, the

15 State has to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, with

16 jury unanimity, that the defendant is guilty of capital

17 murder. And Kansas has one of the most narrow death-

18 penalty statutes in the Nation. And then, past that

19 time, we then engage in a sentencing --

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And --

21 MR. KLINE: -- phase 5.

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- capital murder includes,

23 in this case --

24 MR. KLINE: Capital murder includes, in this

25 case, that the homicide involved more than one person

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

5

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in a single act.

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Involved more than one

3 person. Then, second?

4 MR. KLINE: Then we go to the sentencing

5 phase, in which the State has to prove one of eight

6 statutorily defined aggravating factors beyond a

7 reasonable doubt with jury unanimity. There were three

8 specific aggravating factors that were found by the

9 jury in this instance. And then, the defendant

10 introduces all mitigating evidence, and the standard of

11 introduction is relevancy. But, unlike the Walton

12 case, which has a functionally identical provision that

13 is at issue here, the State maintains the burden,

14 while, in Walton, the burden was provided to the

15 defendant to demonstrate that the mitigating factors

16 were so substantial to call for leniency.

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You had to prove, beyond a

18 reasonable doubt, the mitigating factors do not

19 outweigh the aggravating factors that have already been

20 established.

21 MR. KLINE: That is correct. And that is

22 found in instruction number 10. And as we go through

23 this process, you see that the Kansas death-penalty law

24 has a default to life in virtually every stage of the

25 prosecution of the case. And then, instruction number

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 10 is a determination by the legislature consistent

2 with this Court's precedent, because we have narrowed

3 the class of defendants who are eligible for death,

4 consistent with Furman and the concern for guided

5 discretion. And then, we have allowed the introduction

6 and consideration of all mitigating evidence. The

7 juror is then told how to give the effect that they

8 desire, after the reasoned moral decision, to that

9 mitigating evidence. As defense counsel for Mr. Marsh,

10 in the transcript of the sentencing phase, on page 66,

11 volume 4 -- it is not in your joint appendix, but it is

12 part of the record before the Court -- stated to the

13 jury in closing, "The practical fact is that each of

14 you will decide whether or not you believe death is the

15 appropriate sentence. And if you decide that death is

16 not the appropriate sentence, you have decided that the

17 mitigators outweigh the aggravators."

18 What instruction number 10, which is before

19 you today, which states that the State must prove

20 beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigators do not

21 outweigh the aggravating factors, is, is guidance to

22 the jury on how they can give the --

23 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask --

24 MR. KLINE: -- effect --

25 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question and kind

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

7

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 of cut through -- is it a correct interpretation of the

2 instructions, as a whole, to say, in effect, "If you

3 find the aggravating and mitigating circumstances are

4 equally balanced, you shall impose the death sentence"?

5 MR. KLINE: If a juror finds -- that is

6 correct, Justice Stevens -- if the juror's decided

7 conclusion and reasoned moral judgment is that the

8 mitigating factors and the aggravating factors are in

9 balance, and finds that beyond a reasonable doubt,

10 instruction number 10 clearly indicates that death is

11 the appropriate sentence. So, it --

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: The difficulty I have is in

13 the phrase that you have mentioned in the course of

14 your argument a couple of times referring to the

15 "reasoned moral response." And the difficulty I have

16 in squaring "reasoned moral response" with the

17 construction that the Kansas Court and we all agree is

18 the proper construction of the -- of the -- of the

19 equipoise kind of provision, is this. Kansas has a

20 right, as I understand it, to define what it regards as

21 the aggravating circumstances, those that support a

22 death verdict. And Kansas has done so. Kansas is also

23 saying that if a jury cannot find that the aggravators,

24 as we've defined them, outweigh the mitigators -- i.e.,

25 if the jury is in equipoise -- the result must be

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

8
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 death, anyway. And that does not seem to be a reasoned

2 moral response. I'm assuming that a reasoned moral

3 response would be: the death penalty should be imposed

4 because the aggravators do outweigh -- i.e., it's not

5 equipoise -- the aggravators are heavier. And because

6 Kansas is saying, "Even though they're not, death is

7 the result, anyway," it doesn't seem like a reasoned

8 moral response. What is your answer to that?

9 MR. KLINE: Justice Souter, of course the

10 State believes that it is. It is, first of all,

11 consistent with this Court's precedent as what is

12 required --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's the issue.

14 MR. KLINE: And in the -- in the Walton case,

15 this Court found that a functionally identical

16 provision in Arizona, even though the burden remained

17 on the defendant, was appropriate after the State had

18 met the requirements of guided discretion, as well as

19 the individualized sentencing requirement, in setting

20 about a -- proving that, "This defendant is more

21 deserving of death than anybody else convicted of the

22 same crime."

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: But here we have, it seems

24 to me, to be a stark finding that it has not been

25 proven. That is what "equipoise" means. If

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

9

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 aggravators are the basis for a death sentence, the

2 equipoise finding is, "Aggravators don't predominate.

3 We cannot make that conclusion. We're right on the

4 fence." And it seems to me that to call that a

5 reasoned moral response -- "We're on the fence, but

6 execute anyway" -- seems a total inconsistency.

7 MR. KLINE: The State maintains, Justice

8 Souter, that the decision that the mitigating factors

9 do not outweigh the aggravating factors is a decision,

10 and it is a --

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's a decision that

12 says, "We don't know what should be done." If

13 aggravators define the basis for execution, and

14 mitigators define the basis for life, the equipoise

15 verdict says, in so many words, "We don't know which is

16 more important." And Kansas says, when the jury comes

17 back and says, "We don't know," that the result should

18 be death. And that is what seems to me inconsistent

19 with the notion of a reasoned moral response.

20 MR. KLINE: The distinction, Justice Souter,

21 that I believe, from your analogy, is that the Kansas

22 Legislature has said they do know, and that death is

23 appropriate once a defendant has been found guilty of

24 capital murder, in a very narrow definition. And then,

25 once the --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

10

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me it sounds

2 different if you put it differently. Surely, it's a

3 reasoned moral response to say, "We have found these

4 horrible aggravating factors in this murder. It's not

5 even your usual murder. There are these terrible

6 aggravating factors. Three of them, we found. And we

7 further find that there is no mitigating evidence to

8 outweigh those aggravating factors." That seems to me

9 a perfectly valid moral response.

10 MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice Scalia.

11 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that is not our case, is

12 it? Because our case is not, "We don't find that the

13 mitigators outweigh." Our case is, "We find the

14 mitigators are of equal weight." That's why you get to

15 equipoise. It's not a question of the failure of

16 mitigators to predominate.

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: No.

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: It is the sufficiency of

19 mitigators to equal in weight. And that's what poses

20 the problem, it seems to me.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it seems to me that to

22 be equal in weight is not to predominate. And that's

23 all the jury is saying --

24 MR. KLINE: I would agree, Justice Scalia --

25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if there's nothing to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

11
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 outweigh the aggravating factors.

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Of course it is not to

3 predominate, but it is something more precise than

4 merely not predominating. It is a fact, in effect,

5 that you don't know, if all you know is that they don't

6 predominate. The fact that you know, here, is that

7 they equal, and --

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we know that as a

9 fact?

10 MR. KLINE: Justice Roberts, I believe that

11 there are a couple of things which might help

12 illuminate a little bit more what the jury faces in

13 this instance. First of all, the statement --

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we have a return

15 of a verdict saying, "We find these factors in

16 equipoise"?

17 MR. KLINE: There is a verdict form that

18 requires the jury, with unanimity, if the sentence is

19 death, to indicate that the State has met the burden

20 beyond a reasonable doubt of demonstrating --

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what we have is a

22 situation where this is a theoretical possibility under

23 the statute.

24 MR. KLINE: Correct.

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not a situation where

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

12

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 this is what the jury has said.

2 MR. KLINE: The jury does not find in that

3 fashion.

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's right. We don't --

5 we don't know whether that was the case here or not.

6 MR. KLINE: How --

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: As I understand it, our

8 question is, if a jury could return the death verdict

9 in the equipoise situation, as the Kansas Supreme Court

10 has defined it, is that -- is that statute allowing for

11 that possibility constitutional? Isn't that --

12 MR. KLINE: That is the issue, just --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

14 MR. KLINE: -- as it was in Walton, which had

15 --

16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

17 MR. KLINE: -- a functionally identical

18 provision that required that the defendant demonstrate

19 that there were mitigating factors substantial enough

20 to call for leniency, which --

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're not talking,

22 just -- we're not talking about a numerical equipoise.

23 I -- there's three aggravators and three mitigators,

24 in equipoise. And the -- presumably, the individual

25 jurors can give what weight they think is appropriate

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

13

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 to the mitigating factors. They can find all three

2 aggravators met, and say, "Well, I still think, under

3 factor 18, that mercy ought to outweigh death."

4 MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice Roberts.

5 And, in fact, they are informed that it is not a

6 numerical equation.

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is it -- is it like in

8 a -- in a -- take a civil case where the judge gives

9 the standard charge about, "Imagine two plates and a

10 scale, and if they are in equipoise, then you find

11 against the party who has the burden of proof" -- if we

12 make that comparison, then it's pretty clear that the

13 burden of proof is on the defendant if the answer is --

14 to the equipoise question is, "Then you must come in

15 with a death verdict."

16 MR. KLINE: Justice Ginsburg, unlike in

17 Arizona, there is a specific instruction to the jury

18 that they must decide beyond a reasonable doubt that

19 the mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating

20 factors before the death sentence is imposed. And it

21 is analogous to instructing the jury on how to give the

22 effect they desire to the mitigating and aggravating

23 factors that have been presented. I would possibly

24 agree that we would have a constitutional issue if it

25 was similar to instructing a jury, "You either mark

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

14

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 blue or red on the jury verdict form, and we will not

2 tell you the effect of that decision." However, this

3 instruction clearly lets them know that a decision

4 beyond a reasonable doubt that the State has met its

5 burden, that the mitigators do not outweigh the

6 aggravating factors, that the effect is death. And --

7 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there a difference in the

8 moral burden on the jurors, or the psychological burden

9 on the jurors, in the situation where they have to find

10 that the aggravators outweigh the mitigators, and,

11 therefore, make an affirmative finding that leads to

12 the sentence of death, as opposed to the situation

13 where they can say, "We can't decide, under the

14 applicable burden of proof, which side is weightier,"

15 and, therefore, they allow a default rule to dictate

16 what the sentence is going to be?

17 MR. KLINE: Justice Alito, I do not believe

18 that that is what occurs, because, indecision, under

19 Kansas law, is clearly indicative of a life sentence.

20 In fact, if the jury does not, with unanimity, come

21 together and make an affirmative decision, and indicate

22 such on the verdict form within a reasonable time, they

23 are told and instructed, "the judge shall dismiss the

24 jury." And the State's --

25 JUSTICE ALITO: No, but if they find -- if

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

15
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 they agree, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the

2 aggravators and the mitigators are in equipoise, then

3 they allow the default rule to dictate the sentence of

4 death. Isn't that right?

5 MR. KLINE: That is correct, at some point.

6 I wouldn't term it a "default rule" in every statutory

7 scheme involving the death penalty. There is a point

8 in time when the jury is informed that the result of

9 their deliberations is a death sentence. So, you can

10 call something a default rule in virtually any State.

11 And, in fact, relying on the Walton decision, many

12 States have functionally identical statutes to Kansas,

13 and courts have interpreted the Walton decision as

14 resolving this issue. In Adamson v. Lewis, the Ninth

15 Circuit said that the issue of the potential, the

16 hypothetical, of equipoise was resolved in Walton.

17 Furthermore, the Idaho -- the Seventh Circuit, relating

18 to the Idaho scheme relating to the death penalty,

19 found that this Court resolved the issue in Walton, as

20 did the Illinois Court. So, there have been several

21 findings based on Walton. And, in fact, the Kansas

22 Legislature enacted this death penalty statute soon

23 after Walton --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: General Kline, can I ask

25 you this question? Supposing the law was that you're

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

16

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 supposed to be instructed that, "Unless the mitigating

2 factors substantially outweigh the aggravating factors,

3 the sentence shall be death." Would that be

4 permissible?

5 MR. KLINE: Justice Stevens, as you're aware,

6 that's the Blackmun dissent in Walton, in the

7 hypothetical that he posed with his concern about

8 Walton. I believe that there could come a point in

9 time, based on the instruction, that the jury was not

10 able to give full effect to the mitigating evidence

11 that they desired.

12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what about my

13 hypothetical?

14 MR. KLINE: That's -- that there -- it would

15 approach a time, possibly, where --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would it --

17 MR. KLINE: -- this Court would find --

18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would it be constitutional

19 or unconstitutional?

20 MR. KLINE: This Court, under --

21 JUSTICE STEVENS: In your view.

22 MR. KLINE: On my view? It would approach a

23 problem with this Court's --

24 JUSTICE STEVENS: I know it approaches the

25 problem. I'm wondering if it gets there.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

17

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 [Laughter.]

2 MR. KLINE: I'd defer to the wisdom of this

3 Court.

4 [Laughter.]

5 JUSTICE BREYER: Leaving law out of it, which I'd

6 like to do, just for the sake of argument, imagine

7 you're a juror, and this is a totally contrived

8 situation, which I think we're deciding -- I don't know

9 if there's ever been such a situation -- but you're a

10 juror, and you're told the following by a fellow juror,

11 "The reason that we have these aggravating

12 circumstances, which are hard to understand here, is,

13 we want to be sure this fellow is, morally speaking,

14 somewhat more deserving of death, than the average."

15 And then he says, "And the reason that we

16 have these mitigating circumstances here is because

17 every one of them means that he's somewhat less moral --

18 he's not as morally undeserving, cuts the other way, it

19 reduces -- it makes him less deserving of death,

20 morally speaking."

21 Now, you're the juror, how do you feel about

22 this?"

23 And you say, "They're absolutely in balance,

24 absolutely in balance. For every fact here on the

25 aggravating side that puts me thinking, morally

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

18

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 speaking, he's more deserving of death, there is a

2 mitigating factor which makes me think, morally

3 speaking, he's less deserving of death. So, I'm in

4 perfect balance."

5 And your fellow juror says, "Now, will you

6 please give me, then, one moral reason why he should be

7 executed?"

8 And what's your answer?

9 MR. KLINE: My answer would be that the law

10 clearly provides that if that is the finding --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but if the law says,

12 "You have to be able to give, morally speaking, reason

13 -- you have to reason your way towards the moral

14 conclusion that he's deserving of death" -- that's why

15 I tried to take the law out of it. I don't want you to

16 be a lawyer. I want you to be a juror. And I want you

17 to give a moral reason --

18 MR. KLINE: The moral reason would be --

19 JUSTICE BREYER: -- why, when this is in

20 equipoise, he is more deserving of death than the

21 average.

22 MR. KLINE: Justice Breyer, I would say that

23 the moral reason is, "I know the effect of that

24 deliberation, and I know that, if I make that finding,

25 that the death sentence will be warranted."

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

19

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and of course --

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Well --

3 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the jury doesn't have a

4 free-falling moral judgment to make. It accepts the

5 judgment of the majority of the people in Kansas that

6 certain aggravators, and only those aggravators, shall

7 be counted against the defendant --

8 MR. KLINE: And --

9 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and that all of them

10 shall be -- even if the juror himself does not believe,

11 morally, that this particular aggravator ought to be

12 there. So, it's not as though our law says that

13 somehow the jury has to -- each juror has to be able to

14 make, like Solomon, his own moral judgment on this

15 fellow. And one of the things that the -- that the

16 Kansas law prescribes is that when they're in

17 equipoise, the people of Kansas think that the

18 aggravators that they have specified are serious enough

19 that unless there is something to overcome them, the

20 death penalty is appropriate. That seems to me a moral

21 judgment within the limited range of moral judgment

22 that the jury is accorded.

23 MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice Scalia.

24 And the concern about unfettered moral judgment of a

25 jury calls into question the original purpose for

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

20
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Furman. And so, there is guided discretion --

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, they have

3 unfettered discretion with respect to the mitigating

4 factors, don't they? Under --

5 MR. KLINE: That is correct.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- under factor 18,

7 any other circumstance which they find serves as a

8 basis for a sentence other than death.

9 MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I take it --

11 MR. KLINE: -- Mr. Chief Justice.

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the moral answer is

13 also, "He stands before us with the scales already

14 tipped. He stands before us having been shown, beyond

15 a reasonable doubt, to have committed aggravated

16 murder. He has the obligation to show us why he should

17 be excused from that penalty. He has not done so. We

18 can take anything that he came -- brought to our

19 attention, and we can say that this outweighs." It

20 does not.

21 MR. KLINE: And, Justice Kennedy, that is the

22 decision in the holding in Walton. And --

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that the law in Kansas?

24 I mean, I thought -- correct me if I'm wrong, because I

25 may have made a wrong assumption here -- I thought the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

21

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 finding of guilt to an aggravated murder is the preface

2 to a determination as to whether aggravators or

3 mitigators predominate. And, based upon that

4 determination, there will be a decision as to whether

5 the sentence should be death or life.

6 MR. KLINE: The first determination that a

7 jury engages in is whether the defendant has been

8 proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, guilty of capital

9 murder --

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right.

11 MR. KLINE: -- which is defined in a very

12 narrow statute. Kansas --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: And, at that point, we don't

14 have any way of knowing, I take it, whether the penalty

15 should be life or death.

16 MR. KLINE: Then we have -- you're correct.

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

18 MR. KLINE: And then we have a separate

19 sentencing phase in which the State first bears the

20 burden of demonstrating one -- eight -- of eight

21 aggravating factors is present. And that burden is

22 beyond a reasonable doubt --

23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But --

24 MR. KLINE: -- with jury unanimity.

25 JUSTICE SOUTER: But --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

22

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MR. KLINE: And --

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- what I'm -- what I'm --

3 what I'm getting at is, I don't -- I -- as I understand

4 the Kansas scheme, the determination of guilt, to

5 aggravated murder, does not create a presumption in

6 favor of the death penalty.

7 MR. KLINE: No, the --

8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

9 MR. KLINE: -- that is correct. That is

10 correct. There are several steps.

11 JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what you mean

12 by a "presumption." It certainly -- it certainly says

13 that unless you find something that outweighs this, the

14 death penalty is the proper penalty.

15 MR. KLINE: Justice Scalia --

16 JUSTICE SCALIA: The burden is on the jury to

17 find something to outweigh it. And, in the absence of

18 a finding of something that outweighs it, when these

19 aggravators are found, the death penalty is the proper

20 penalty.

21 MR. KLINE: Justice Scalia, that is correct.

22 Once the State has met the burden of proving that one

23 of the eight statutory aggravators is present --

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. But the fact of --

25 let me -- I think we've got a terminological problem --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

23

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 the fact that there has been a finding of guilt of

2 aggravated murder is not tantamount, as I understand

3 it, to a finding that aggravating factors to be

4 considered at the penalty phase have also been found.

5 Is that --

6 MR. KLINE: That is --

7 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- correct?

8 MR. KLINE: -- correct.

9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

10 MR. KLINE: There is a separate burden there

11 --

12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

13 MR. KLINE: -- Justice Souter. And as it

14 relates to the "give effect" language, the cases that

15 this Court has considered regarding that are

16 dramatically different. In those cases, such as the

17 Penry cases and other cases, the concern was, the jury

18 was affirmatively instructed that they could not use

19 evidence that was introduced and relevant in a manner

20 which would lead to mitigation, such as the defendant's

21 youthfulness. And the special instruction in Texas

22 said that they could only utilize that evidence to

23 determine whether there was a likelihood of re-offense.

24 And this Court reasoned that it is possible to look at

25 youthfulness as mitigating factor which diminishes the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

24

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 moral culpability of the defendant. There is no claim

2 in this case that the jurors were unable to take the

3 mitigating evidence and give it whatever effect they

4 desired in mitigation. In fact, they are instructed

5 that they must individually consider all such evidence.

6 And then they are instructed to make their decision

7 based upon what effect that they would give it.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can --

9 MR. KLINE: So --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you a question

11 that goes to your response to Justice Souter's last

12 question? As I understand the scheme, maybe my

13 understanding is wrong, once they have found the

14 existence of those aggravating factors that justify the

15 death penalty, and then you move into the penalty phase

16 for them to decide whether, in fact, the death penalty

17 would be imposed, it's not up to them to -- they can't

18 eliminate one of those aggravating factors that has

19 been found. They have to take into account all of the

20 aggravating factors that have been found. Isn't that

21 right?

22 MR. KLINE: That's correct, Justice Scalia.

23 I think the confusion is the use of the term

24 "aggravated murder," which would be not quite correct

25 under Kansas law. There is a statutory requirement of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

25

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 a finding of guilt of capital murder, and that is in

2 very narrow circumstances. Kansas has one of the most

3 narrow death penalties in the Nation. Then once that

4 guilt is determined, we then move to the phase where

5 the State must prove an aggravating factor in addition

6 to having proved that the defendant is guilty of

7 capital murder.

8 Once that is achieved, then the

9 jurors are instructed to give way to a consideration to

10 all aggravating factors that they find, with unanimity,

11 to exist, and to consider all mitigating evidence which

12 they find, individually, to exist, with the only burden

13 on the defendant being relevancy for introduction. And

14 then, they are instructed to consider whether the State

15 has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the

16 mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating

17 factors.

18 And, Mr. Chief Justice, if it may please the

19 Court, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General

21 Kline.

22 Ms. Woodman.

23 ORAL ARGUMENT OF REBECCA E. WOODMAN

24 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

25 MS. WOODMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

26

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 please the Court:

2 Since the argument of the attorney general

3 was addressed exclusively to the question of the

4 constitutionality of the Kansas statute, I will devote

5 all of my argument to that subject, as well, although I

6 am sure that the Court, in deliberations, will be

7 considering the several jurisdictional issues which

8 were briefed and argued earlier in the term. And if

9 there are no questions on those jurisdictional issues,

10 I will proceed to the merits.

11 To pick up on some of the things that were

12 said during Attorney General Kline's argument, the

13 Eighth Amendment requires reliability in the

14 determination that death is an appropriate sentence.

15 And at the selection stage, the question is whether the

16 jury has made a reliable, collective, responsible

17 decision based upon the unique circumstances of the

18 individual defendant that death is an appropriate

19 sentence and that this defendant is particularly

20 culpable in a way that distinguishes him from the mass

21 of death-eligible defendants. And the problem with the

22 equipoise provision here, which the State agrees can

23 occur under the Kansas statute, is that we don't know

24 from a death verdict pronounced by a jury in Kansas

25 whether the jury did decree death by equipoise or not.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

27

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 Death sentences must be rationally reviewable. And

2 when we look at the -- at a death sentence that's been

3 pronounced in Kansas, we can't determine whether the

4 jury decreed death by equipoise.

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We are confident that the

6 jury found aggravating factors. We know that.

7 MS. WOODMAN: Yes.

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And we know --

9 MS. WOODMAN: Yes, and I agree --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that they found them

11 beyond a reasonable doubt.

12 MS. WOODMAN: Yes. The jury did find an

13 aggravating factor beyond --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And we know --

15 MS. WOODMAN: -- a reasonable --

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- we --

17 MS. WOODMAN: -- doubt.

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and we know that they

19 found that the defendant had not shown that mitigating

20 factors outweighed those aggravating factors.

21 MS. WOODMAN: That's right. But the Kansas

22 Supreme Court, in the Kleypas case, examined the Kansas

23 statute -- which, by the way, is unique to Kansas; no

24 other State in the country has a statute like this, and

25 this will affect no State outside of Kansas -- they

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

28
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 examined this statute in great detail, and they --

2 JUSTICE SCALIA: You disagree from your --

3 with your friend on the other side on that point.

4 MS. WOODMAN: Whether it's unique?

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: How can we check on that?

6 No, he said that a number of other State statutes would

7 be affected by our coming out the way you would like

8 us, on this.

9 MS. WOODMAN: I don't see how, because --

10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because he said --

11 MS. WOODMAN: -- Kansas --

12 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- he said it would change

13 Walton, and that would impair those other State

14 statutes.

15 MS. WOODMAN: As we argue in our brief,

16 Walton simply did not speak to this --

17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

18 MS. WOODMAN: -- issue. And, in fact, the

19 Arizona Supreme Court, in Walton, interpreted the

20 Arizona statute to require that aggravators outweigh

21 mitigators.

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't mean to

23 interrupt your argument, but presumably the attorney

24 general will tell us, in his rebuttal.

25 MS. WOODMAN: Sure. And the Montana statute,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

29

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 which reads precisely the way Arizona's is, they've

2 decided the equipoise issue and said that the language

3 of that statute does not mandate death by equipoise.

4 So, those statutes are distinguishable, and there's

5 simply no other State that has a statute which mandates

6 death by equipoise.

7 In any event, the Kansas Supreme Court did

8 interpret the statute to contain a mandatory death-by-

9 equipoise provision, which the State's question

10 presented assumes is the case. And the court, familiar

11 with the way the statute has operated, and is likely to

12 operate it in Kansas, found that equipoise can happen,

13 and that it risks unreliability in capital sentencing

14 in a way that's forbidden by the Eighth Amendment. And

15 I think one of the problems here is that the

16 terminology of "weighing" conveys a false impression of

17 predefined weights. And the attorney general conceded

18 that that's not how juries consider the balancing of

19 aggravating and mitigating circumstances. And we agree

20 with that. And that's why it is wrong to view this as

21 principally a burden-of-proof issue. It's not. The

22 issue, at the selection stage -- the State certainly

23 has the burden to prove an aggravating circumstance

24 beyond a reasonable doubt, but, at the selection stage,

25 the issue is not meeting some particular burden of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

30
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 proof, it's whether the jury has made a reliable,

2 responsible, collective decision that this unique

3 defendant deserves the death penalty that distinguishes

4 him --

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that --

6 MS. WOODMAN: -- from other death-eligible --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that that --

8 MS. WOODMAN: -- defendants.

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that that hurts you

10 somewhat. If you want to give us this visual metaphor

11 of a scale, or a football field, where you move it

12 beyond the 50-yardline, whatever visual metaphor you

13 want, and you weigh, you balance where the scales of

14 justice balances, it seems to me that that's a stronger

15 case than saying the jurors can establish their

16 aggravation, then they can take any mitigating factor

17 they want, for any reason, and apply it. And they

18 can't do that, because the defendant hasn't shown it.

19 It seems to me that that's -- that that's a weaker

20 argument than if you had this balancing mechanism that

21 was our controlling metaphor.

22 MS. WOODMAN: Well, let's look at the way

23 that equipoise can happen under the Kansas statute --

24 and I think Justice Alito alluded to it -- that if the

25 jurors can't decide between aggravated and mitigating

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

31

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 circumstances, the sentence is death. The statute

2 decrees death, and --

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They've already decided

4 aggravating circumstances, you can't say they can't decide it.

5 They've already decided aggravating circumstances.

6 MS. WOODMAN: They've decided --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what they're deciding

8 is that there's no mitigating circumstances to outweigh

9 it.

10 MS. WOODMAN: What they've decided is that,

11 in looking at aggravating and mitigating circumstances

12 together, they can't determine, one way or the other,

13 whether aggravators outweigh mitigators or mitigators --

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But --

15 MS. WOODMAN: -- outweigh aggravators.

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But how realistic is

17 that as a possibility when you're talking about

18 abstract concepts as mitigating factors, like how much

19 mercy should be shown? I mean, do you really think

20 there's any juror who's going to say, "All right, I'm

21 giving -- I've found the aggravating circumstance that

22 he killed two people, and I've found the aggravating

23 circumstance that it was particularly heinous to slash

24 the throat and leave the toddler to burn. But I also

25 think that mercy ought to be shown. But, you know, it

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

32
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 just happens to come up to exactly the level of the

2 aggravating circumstances. So, I'm stuck. I don't

3 know what to do." I don't think that's the way jurors

4 would react. They either think that the need to show

5 mercy or, the one before that, that he's a talented

6 artist, outweighs the fact of the aggravating

7 circumstances, or it doesn't. I just think it's an

8 unrealistic supposition. And there's nothing in the

9 statute -- they don't get an equipoise instruction.

10 So, how -- I mean, is there any reason to think that

11 jurors do come to that balance between such inchoate

12 concepts in the first place?

13 MS. WOODMAN: Yes. I think it can occur in

14 close cases. And, after all, those are the only cases

15 where equipoise would even be relevant. And let me

16 give you an example. Suppose there's a woman who wants

17 to donate a million dollars to Yale Law School, and, as

18 part of that donation, she's going to -- she has --

19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that an aggravating

20 circumstance?

21 [Laughter.]

22 MS. WOODMAN: Well, bear with me for a

23 minute, Your Honor. She has to choose a portrait of

24 her beloved husband to hang in the law school. These

25 portraits were taken at different times, they have

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

33
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 different qualities, different features. And she has

2 to choose one. And this decision proves

3 extraordinarily difficult for her to make. And she

4 compares the relative qualities of the two portraits.

5 They're both good. She loved her husband. And she

6 simply cannot choose between the two. And so, she does

7 one of two things. One is that she just can't bear to

8 debate with herself anymore about which one is the

9 better-quality portrait; and so, she becomes agnostic

10 about it and says, "I give up. Pick one." And so, she

11 picks one. The other is that the decision is simply

12 too difficult for her to make; and so, she abdicates

13 that decision and says, "Let the dean pick."

14 And you can analogize that to the ways in

15 which this statute can operate. And the jury can

16 arrive at equipoise by becoming agnostic about the

17 decision on whether -- on the balance between

18 aggravating/mitigating --

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think your --

20 MS. WOODMAN: -- circumstances.

21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think your analogy

22 took away what I would have regarded as the basis for

23 my question. I think it may well be true that people

24 have difficulty deciding between two portraits. I'm

25 not sure people come to the sense that someone who's

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

34

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 guilty of allowing a 19-month-old to burn to death and

2 slashing the throat of her mother thinks it's equally

3 balanced when they're inclined to show mercy, for

4 whatever reason. It seems to me they either make a

5 determination that the circumstances of his upbringing,

6 emotional instability outweigh the responsibility for

7 what they had found to be aggravating factors, or they

8 determine that the aggravating factors outweigh the

9 fact that they may show mercy for other basis. I just

10 -- I can see thinking two portraits are

11 indistinguishable. I just don't see a juror

12 functioning and saying, "I just can't decide whether to

13 show mercy or to convict for death." And they're

14 equally balanced. I understand the idea they may

15 debate it with the other jurors, but, to come and say,

16 "You know, I just can't decide," it seems to me that

17 the -- particularly since they can put as much weight

18 into the mitigating factors as they want -- they can

19 say, "I want to show a lot of mercy," they can say, "I

20 want to show a little bit of mercy" -- but to say that,

21 "I want to show just enough mercy that is exactly

22 balanced," I don't understand that.

23 MS. WOODMAN: Well, you see, individual

24 jurors, in the course of deliberations -- this is a

25 qualitative judgment, after all, and individual jurors,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

35

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 in the course of deliberations, might be leaning one

2 way or the other at different times during

3 deliberations. But what this equipoise provision does

4 is that it allows the jurors to compromise on equipoise

5 when they simply cannot deliberate anymore, or if they

6 simply just want to avoid making the hard decision.

7 JUSTICE ALITO: Would it be constitutional if

8 the Kansas statute said that, "The jury must find, by a

9 preponderance, that the aggravating factors outweigh

10 the mitigating factors"?

11 MS. WOODMAN: Yes.

12 JUSTICE ALITO: And wouldn't a defendant be

13 better off under the current Kansas statute than under

14 a statute like that, where, under the current statute,

15 the jury has to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that

16 the aggravating factors and the mitigating factors are

17 at least in equipoise?

18 MS. WOODMAN: Well, the jury does have to

19 find equipoise beyond a reasonable doubt. But the fact

20 remains that the jury is making that decision of

21 equipoise, which requires the death sentence, without

22 having made the individualized sentencing determination

23 required at the selection stage under the Eighth

24 Amendment. And that's the problem with the equipoise

25 provision, because it allows the jury to avoid making

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

36

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 that decision, which is --

2 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I mean --

3 MS. WOODMAN: -- required.

4 JUSTICE ALITO: -- suppose the jury thinks

5 that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating

6 factors 51-49. Now, under the first statute that I

7 hypothesized, that would result in a verdict of death,

8 would it not? What would the result be under the --

9 under the current Kansas statute, where the aggravators

10 have to be shown, beyond a reasonable doubt, to

11 outweigh the mitigators?

12 MS. WOODMAN: Well, I think if the statute

13 requires that the aggravators outweigh mitigators, this

14 Court has upheld that formula. That is a decision that

15 the jury has made. And the legislature can make that

16 decision. And so, when you look -- that's why I'm

17 trying to -- I mean, the State agrees that this is not

18 a quantitative determination. And I will grant you, if

19 the jury is -- if it were a quantitative determination,

20 which is totally unrealistic, and we agree with the

21 State's reasoning on that -- then if the jury is

22 precisely exactly equivalent, 50-50, on aggravating and

23 mitigating circumstances, that might be said to

24 constitute a decision. But, as even the State argues,

25 that's not how jury deliberations work. And under this

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

37

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 equipoise provision, the jury can decree death without

2 having made the individualized sentencing decision

3 required at the selection stage. And it's because, on

4 the one hand, if the decision is too close to call, the

5 equipoise provision allows the jurors to simply give up

6 and settle on equipoise as a group. This is a group

7 decision, after all. They have to be unanimous on the

8 question of whether aggravators --

9 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you --

10 MS. WOODMAN: -- are not --

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question?

12 MS. WOODMAN: -- outweighed by mitigators.

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Suppose the jurors are

14 deadlocked, six to six, and you're not -- you don't

15 know, maybe some are a little stronger there, but

16 there's a deadlock. And what if the judge told them,

17 "Well, in the event of a deadlock, you resolve it by

18 flipping a coin." Would that be constitutional?

19 MS. WOODMAN: Absolutely not, because they're

20 not making the decision that's required at the

21 selection stage.

22 And to follow up on something that General

23 Kline said during his argument, that the provision is

24 for a hung jury, there's no provision for a hung jury

25 in the event the jury finds itself in equipoise. The

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

38

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 only provision for a hung jury, under the Kansas

2 statute, is if the jury is unable to reach a verdict.

3 But equipoise, does not prevent a death verdict. In

4 fact, the statute requires a death verdict if the

5 jurors are in equipoise.

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the verdict that

7 the jury returns is a verdict of death. They do not

8 return a verdict saying, "We're in equipoise," and then

9 the death sentence is imposed by operation of law. The

10 verdict imposed is, "We do not find -- we find these

11 aggravating circumstances. We find they're not

12 outweighed. And, therefore, we sentence the defendant

13 to death."

14 MS. WOODMAN: Well, a determination of

15 equipoise -- the jury has to find equipoise beyond a

16 reasonable doubt, and that, necessarily, means that the

17 aggravators are not outweighed my mitigators.

18 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but --

19 MS. WOODMAN: That's how this statute was

20 interpreted by the Kansas Supreme Court.

21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I think -- I think

22 the Chief Justice's point is that you're -- you're

23 really not being accurate when you say, "The jurors can

24 thereby avoid the difficult choice." They don't avoid

25 the difficult choice. They're fully aware, under this

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

39

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 statutory scheme, that if they don't find that the

2 mitigators outweigh, they are condemning this person to

3 death. That's the moral choice they're faced with.

4 And when they come in with that verdict, they know what

5 they're doing. And I consider that a moral -- a moral

6 judgment on their part.

7 MS. WOODMAN: Well, the jury certainly knows

8 that they are imposing a death sentence. But what this

9 instruction and the prosecutorial arguments given in

10 the cases tell them is that they can fulfill their

11 responsibilities as jurors without coming to a final

12 judgment about whether aggravators outweigh mitigators,

13 or vice versa.

14 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you think that a juror

15 who believes that this person shouldn't be -- shouldn't

16 be sent to death -- that is to say, who believes that

17 the mitigators outweigh the aggravators -- would join a

18 jury verdict which produces the result that he's

19 sentenced to death, right? I think that is so unlikely

20 --

21 MS. WOODMAN: But in --

22 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that he's going to say,

23 "Well, I -- you know, I think he shouldn't go to death,

24 but the aggravators and mitigators are absolutely

25 evenly balanced, so I guess I've got to send him to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

40

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 death," I don't think any juror's going to do that.

2 MS. WOODMAN: But the fact that this is a

3 group decision leads to even a greater risk of

4 abdication of --

5 JUSTICE SCALIA: It takes only one --

6 MS. WOODMAN: -- that decision.

7 JUSTICE SCALIA: It takes only one to

8 disagree.

9 MS. WOODMAN: But it's a group decision, and

10 jurors are encouraged and forced to compromise to come

11 to a verdict. And in close cases, with jurors leaning

12 slightly one way or another, they, being forced to come

13 to a consensus, are even more likely to compromise on

14 equipoise, rather than engage in the draining task of

15 persuading each person leaning one way or the other to

16 come together.

17 JUSTICE SOUTER: But regardless of the

18 likelihood of that situation in any given case -- and I

19 happen to agree with Justice Scalia; I mean, I don't

20 think the likelihood of that in a given case is great --

21 we're, nonetheless, I think, faced with the fact that

22 the Supreme Court of Kansas says, "That can happen."

23 MS. WOODMAN: Absolutely.

24 JUSTICE SOUTER: "And if it does happen, the

25 result is death." And I think we've --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

41

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. WOODMAN: That's right.

2 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- we've got to take that as

3 a given. I mean --

4 MS. WOODMAN: That's right.

5 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- do you see any way out of

6 it? I --

7 MS. WOODMAN: That's right. This Court is

8 bound by the Kansas Supreme Court's interpretation of

9 the statute. And what's happening here is, when the

10 jurors do settle on equipoise, in whatever way they

11 settle on equipoise, the fact of the matter that -- is

12 that in either of -- either of the two cases I've --

13 well, either in -- in three cases I've described, the

14 jurors are following their instructions, and, in either

15 of these situations, the defendant is being sentenced

16 to death only as a death-eligible defendant, because

17 that's the only constitutionally required decision

18 that's actually been made by the jury in that

19 situation. And to go back to Justice Breyer's

20 hypothetical about the box from the last argument, the

21 legislature has determined that the individuals will be

22 separated out as a result of equipoise, but there is

23 nothing about that situation, them being in that box,

24 that separates them from any other generic death-

25 eligible defendant. And that's the problem with this

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

42

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 equipoise provision. And, yes, the Kansas Supreme

2 Court found that it can happen. This Court is bound by

3 that interpretation. The State concedes that. And,

4 therefore --

5 JUSTICE STEVENS: You mentioned the --

6 MS. WOODMAN: The --

7 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- Kansas Legislature. Has

8 there been any suggestion the statute ought to be

9 amended to get rid of this silly little problem?

10 MS. WOODMAN: Yes.

11 JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't mean to call it --

12 MS. WOODMAN: Yes.

13 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- silly little problem,

14 but --

15 MS. WOODMAN: Yes, and I think --

16 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- the very narrow --

17 MS. WOODMAN: -- the Legislature is going to

18 take that up again. And there's simply no consequence

19 to anyone else by affirming the Kansas Supreme Court's

20 decision in this case. The Legislature is going to

21 take the matter up again. There's no question about

22 that.

23 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, how is it --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: -- anything --

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

43
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- how is it -- is

2 there any question about how it's going to come out

3 when they take it up again?

4 [Laughter.]

5 MS. WOODMAN: Well, I wouldn't want to

6 speculate on that. There are going to be arguments on

7 both sides, certainly.

8 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if they still conclude,

9 as they did before, that when these aggravating factors

10 are found, unless there is mitigation to overcome them,

11 it is the judgment of the people of Kansas that this

12 person is deserving of death? What if they come to

13 that conclusion again? You want us to tell them, "No,

14 the people of Kansas cannot come to that, what seems to

15 me, quite rational decision"?

16 MS. WOODMAN: Well, but there is no moral

17 judgment, as has been stated here. There's no moral

18 judgment. The State can -- the Legislature can

19 determine that death is an appropriate sentence. The

20 Legislature -- this Court upheld a legislative

21 determination, when aggravators outweigh mitigators, in

22 Blystone, that --

23 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's so silly to say that

24 Kansas can circumscribe the moral judgment of the -- of

25 the jury by saying, "You can take into account 18

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

44
Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 aggravators, or else only two aggravators." That is a

2 -- you know, a significant control on their moral

3 judgment. But then to say that Kansas cannot

4 circumscribe their moral judgment to the very limited

5 degree of saying, "Unless you find that the mitigators

6 outweigh the aggravators, the proper response is the

7 death penalty."

8 MS. WOODMAN: But you cannot divorce the

9 weighing process enacted by the legislature from the

10 individualized sentencing decision required under the

11 Eighth Amendment at the selection stage. And the

12 equipoise --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I --

14 MS. WOODMAN: -- provision.

15 JUSTICE SOUTER: If I -- if I may interrupt

16 you, I -- your point, I take it, is, the jurors have

17 got to make this decision, not the Legislature of

18 Kansas.

19 MS. WOODMAN: That's right.

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

21 MS. WOODMAN: And if the Legislature --

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But haven't the jurors made

23 the decision that, "We have looked at all of the moral

24 arguments that he has presented. Each of one of the --

25 of us has individually weighed them. Each one of us

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

45

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 know that if we have any moral reason not to impose the

2 death penalty, we can do it. And we make the moral

3 judgment that we cannot make that determination."

4 MS. WOODMAN: But the --

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Moral judgment, from

6 beginning to end.

7 MS. WOODMAN: This statute allows a third

8 option of equipoise, which allows a jury to impose

9 death without making that judgment.

10 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, well, what do you say

11 to --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but that's -- your term

13 is "equipoise." You say the jury has done nothing --

14 MS. WOODMAN: The Kansas Supreme Court's --

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you say the jury has

16 done nothing. What the jury has done is, it's weighed

17 all the evidence with great care, and it's said that,

18 "Beyond a reasonable doubt, the mitigating

19 circumstances do not overcome." That is a moral

20 judgment.

21 MS. WOODMAN: But the --

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you label it

23 "equipoise."

24 MS. WOODMAN: The other possibilities are

25 that the jury has found that, "We can't decide whether

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

46

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 aggravators outweigh mitigators, or vice versa. And

2 the statute tells -- the instructions tell us to impose

3 death."

4 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I think Justice Kennedy

5 is saying, when they make that determination, "We can't

6 tell whether one outweighs the other," that they are

7 making a moral judgment there. And what's your --

8 what's your answer to that?

9 MS. WOODMAN: That is --

10 JUSTICE SOUTER: He's saying they are making

11 a moral judgment.

12 MS. WOODMAN: That is not a moral --

13 JUSTICE SOUTER: And they know what its

14 consequence is.

15 MS. WOODMAN: That is not a moral judgment,

16 because it says nothing about the personal culpability

17 --

18 JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words you're --

19 MS. WOODMAN: -- of the --

20 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- saying moral --

21 MS. WOODMAN: -- defendants.

22 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- judgment has got to be an

23 either/or judgment, not a "we can't figure it out"

24 judgment.

25 MS. WOODMAN: Absolutely.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

47

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

2 JUSTICE BREYER: But the difficulty, I think,

3 in the case is, it's artificial. I think it is. We're

4 in an artificial situation, and we're imagining those

5 12 jurors saying they're in equipoise between

6 mitigating and aggravating. We don't know. They --

7 even. All right. Now, you could look at this as

8 saying, "You have to have a reason for thinking these

9 people are -- this person is morally worse than the

10 average." And then we imagine some fungible commodity,

11 like moral badness units. And for every one we go up

12 on the aggravating side, we go down on the mitigating

13 side, so we're back to zero. And then, some people,

14 like you, are looking at this and saying, "See, you're

15 at zero. You went up, you went down, so they're no

16 worse than the average." But other people can look at

17 it and say, "We'll tell you about -- one thing about

18 this individual. This is an individual who did do the

19 aggravating things, and he has counterbalancing

20 mitigating things, and that's good enough to separate

21 him out, morally speaking, from somebody who doesn't.

22 Now, my problem is, you either look at it the

23 one way or you look at the other way, and you -- and

24 I'm trying to find a reasoned -- if you -- can -- do

25 you want to add anything?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

48

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 MS. WOODMAN: Well, I mean, the Kansas

2 Supreme Court determined that equipoise can happen.

3 And in the situations that I've described, there is a

4 real risk under this statute that the jury can either

5 become agnostic and just pick, and the statute requires

6 them to pick death, or the jury, encouraged by

7 prosecutorial arguments to abdicate the decision, do

8 abdicate, simply cop out and impose death, because it

9 allows them to avoid making the tough choice. And I

10 think those are very real possibilities under this

11 statute. The statute requires death in those

12 situations, and it's the risk that this procedure poses

13 that presents the problem. And this Court has always

14 held that these kinds of risks of unconstitutional

15 results are intolerable in capital cases. And we

16 simply cannot look at a death sentence in Kansas and

17 say, with any reliability at all, that this jury did

18 not decree death by equipoise, that this jury made the

19 reliable sentencing judgment required under the Eighth

20 Amendment at the selection stage. We just can't say

21 that under this statute.

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think that under this

23 instruction, a Kansas juror could say, "You know, I'm

24 not interested in deliberating more. I'm not going to

25 participate"? That's what you're want -- that's what

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

49

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 you want us to believe, right, based on this argument?

2 I -- that's just -- any juror -- any jury can ignore

3 its instructions. There's nothing I can do about that.

4 MS. WOODMAN: Well, they're not --

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Here, they are instructed

6 to consider every mitigating circumstance that's

7 presented and determine whether or not that should be a

8 factor in their decision.

9 MS. WOODMAN: They're not -- they're not

10 ignoring their instructions at all. They're following

11 their instructions if they arrive at equipoise. And

12 the instructions and the prosecutorial arguments tell

13 them to impose death. The prosecutorial --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --

15 MS. WOODMAN: -- arguments are --

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you're suggesting

17 that they kind of --

18 MS. WOODMAN: -- perfectly in line.

19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that they can tune out.

20 MS. WOODMAN: It's not that they're tuning

21 out. They take their jobs very seriously. But what

22 they are encouraged to believe by the instructions and

23 the prosecutorial arguments is that they will fulfill

24 their responsibilities as jurors without coming to a

25 final judgment on whether aggravators outweigh

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

50

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 mitigators or vice versa. And it's the risk that they

2 will do that, that makes this statute unconstitutional.

3 And the Kansas Supreme Court determined that there is

4 such a risk of equipoise under this statute that it

5 cannot comply with the Eighth Amendment.

6 Thank you.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.

8 Woodman.

9 General Kline, you have 4 minutes remaining.

10 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILL KLINE

11 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

12 MR. KLINE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

13 First, referring to Justice Scalia's question

14 as it relates to other States that are affected, in the

15 joint appendix, pages 98 through 107, you have a

16 summary, and, additionally, in the amici brief that was

17 filed by several States, on page 23, it identifies

18 Arizona, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and

19 Missouri as having similar provisions. And,

20 additionally, the cases that have relied on Walton to

21 determine that the equipoise issue has been resolved

22 are the Eleventh Circuit, in Jones v. Dugger, the

23 Arizona Supreme Court. And in State v. Gretzler, they

24 found that the provision provided for equipoise, as

25 well as in Idaho, in State v. Hoffman.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

51

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 As it relates to a juror somehow imposing

2 death when they are undecided, I would direct you to

3 page 26 of the joint appendix, at instruction number 9,

4 which reads, "The Defendant is entitled to the

5 individual opinion of each juror. Each of you must

6 consider the evidence for the purpose of reaching a

7 verdict. Each of you must decide the case for

8 yourself."

9 Furthermore, the jury is instructed, in

10 instruction number 12 in the second paragraph on page

11 28 of the joint appendix, that, "In order to reach a

12 verdict in the case, your decision must be unanimous.

13 And then, after reasonable deliberation, if you are

14 unable to reach a unanimous verdict, you shall notify

15 the Court, and the result is a life sentence."

16 Kansas law is very clear that death is only

17 appropriate in the singular instance in which a jury

18 has found beyond a reasonable doubt with unanimity that

19 the defendant is guilty of capital murder, that an

20 aggravating factor exists, and then that the mitigating

21 factors do not outweigh the aggravating factors.

22 It was in 1994 that the Kansas Legislature

23 passed the death penalty in Kansas, a few years after

24 the Walton decision. And I was there for the debate,

25 as a legislator. It was a compelling moment, not just

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

52

Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1 because of the result, but the solemnity and

2 seriousness of the debate in which they were seeking to

3 define, through their reasoned moral judgment, what

4 justice demands in instances such as this.

5 And recognizing this Court as the final

6 arbiter of the meaning of the Eighth Amendment, you

7 will see, through pages 23 through 28 of your appendix,

8 your words mirrored back to you. The Legislature has

9 respected your judgment and made the reasoned moral

10 decision that death is appropriate in the instances --

11 JUSTICE ALITO: Was there a particular --

12 MR. KLINE: -- that we are discussing.

13 JUSTICE ALITO: -- was there a reason why

14 they provided that, in the case of equipoise, the

15 sentence would be death? Or is that just a quirk of

16 the way the provision was written?

17 MR. KLINE: In the debate, all of these

18 decisions were discussed through committee as well as

19 on the legislative floor. And the belief was, in these

20 various aggravated and narrow circumstances, that the

21 State believes death is appropriate. And if we

22 followed the individualized sentencing line of these

23 cases and allowed a jury to consider all of the

24 mitigating evidence that is relevant, that the State

25 could make that decision.
