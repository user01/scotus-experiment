The court of appeals held that, in the face of that statutory bar, a Federal district court could itself grant respondent relief from firearms disabilities. That holding is contrary to fundamental principles of judicial review of agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act. Under the APA --"

Could Congress create a substantive obligation, for example, in an appropriations law, provide that, oh, I don't know, nobody shall sell stock on Tuesdays? Could they put that in an appropriations measure?"

  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Yes. Now, what the Court has said is that if a subsequent appropriations statute is said to repeal or suspend the application of a prior law, that intention has to be made clear, but here we think that there's no question that the annual Appropriations Act is clear. There's nothing implied about what Congress did here. There is an express prohibition against ATF either investigating or acting upon applications for relief."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, that's the holding of Dickerson, is it not?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Yes. So what we have here is an express prohibition against ATF exercising the power that Congress conferred on it. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, the only power a court has in judicial review of agency action is to review what the agency did, and it may only set aside the agency action if the agency action is arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "I don't know if it really bears on the case, but suppose Congress had a completely different scheme, and it said that the firearms violator's license could be restored if he applied to United States district court, no agency at all, you just go to court. Would that be a violation of Article III?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Well, I think there would be a question about that. As I recall, there was, and I think it still may be true that courts may grant applications for naturalization, but the court I believe concluded that there was at least an implicit adversarial process in the sense that the Government could appear on the other side of the case and oppose it, but I think you raise a very good point in terms of what would be the traditional way that something like this would be accomplished, and that is that it would be natural, and this is what Congress did in 925(c), to confer this authority on the executive branch, and it did it in very broad and general terms and then provided that a person whose application is denied may file a petition in district court for judicial review of such denial. In other words, under 925(c) it is the denial by the ATF, not the application itself, that is the subject of judicial review."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Is the refusal of the ATF to act on an application pursuant to this provision in the appropriation a de facto denial that's reviewable?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "We think it is not. As we explained in our brief, we believe the word denial in that context means a denial on the merits, and this is what a number of the courts of appeals that have looked at the question have held, and what Congress said in the Appropriations Act is that ATF is barred from even acting upon the application. In other words, it can't either grant or deny the application for relief, and therefore the predicate for judicial review under 925(c) is missing. We're not saying that there is no judicial review at all. The general provisions of the APA remain available and, under 5 U.S.C. 703, the avenue for judicial review, or the form of the judicial review is either the special statutory review procedure, in this case 925(c), or in the absence of that or its inadequacy, then another appropriate form, in other words, the general provisions of the APA. But once again, the power of a court under the general provisions of the APA is simply to review the agency's action and to set it aside if contrary to law, and here the action was not contrary to law, it was compelled by law. The most direct avenue that respondent could have challenged the agency's approach in this case, its failure to act, was under section 706(1), which provides for a court in reviewing agency action to set aside agency action that is -- or excuse me, to compel agency action that is unreasonably delayed or unlawfully withheld; and, again, there was nothing unlawful about ATF's withholding of a decision on respondent's application for relief, because Congress compelled that withholding."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Mr. Kneedler, there was an alternate argument that a foreign conviction shouldn't count for this purpose. Has the United States ever taken a position on that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Yes. Yes, we have. It is the position of the United States that foreign convictions are covered by the act. Now, that is not before the Court. The -- in fact, below respondent conceded that a foreign conviction is a proper predicate under 922(g)(1), and the Eleventh Circuit expressly declined to reach that question. It wasn't presented in the petition and it's not before this Court. Indeed, the question of whether a foreign conviction would be a proper predicate is something that would be raised under 922(g) in a prosecution. As we point out in our brief, there is a circuit conflict on that question, but that conflict has arisen in cases, criminal prosecutions brought under 922(g), and that would be the proper place to begin to make that claim. Neither the general provisions of the APA nor 925(c) provides someone who is wondering whether he may or may not be covered by a provision of the Federal criminal laws to bring a declaratory judgment against the United States to determine whether conduct he hopes to engage in would be covered by a particular criminal statute. So even though it -- it isn't before this Court, but we also believe that this would not be the proper avenue in which to raise such a claim in any event. Respondent has argued that what is going on here is an implied repeal of the judicial review provisions or the jurisdiction of the Federal courts to act in a case such as this and, as I've said, there's nothing implied. What Congress did was expressly bar ATF, and it otherwise left the court's authority unaffected. 925(c) remains in effect. It's just that, by virtue of Congress's prohibiting ATF from acting on applications for relief, there is no denial which could be the predicate for review under that, under that special statutory review procedure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, do you think that that's 100 percent clear? I mean, in Robertson, the amendment of a prior statute was affected not by the simple means of withholding appropriations. I mean, it set forth different language that was going to govern the matter. Here, the only thing that has happened is they're not given any appropriations, and you think it is not a matter -- you think it's entirely clear that when the Secretary receives an application and says, I cannot act on this application because the appropriations rider forbids me, do you think it's entirely clear that that does not amount to a denial of the application?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "I think that's the better reading of the statute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, it may be the better one, but is it clear? I mean, the law is that unless you make it quite clear in the appropriations statute that you are intending to amend the prior law, the prior law is not amended."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Again, the -- our position is not that Congress amended the judicial review provision of 925(c). What it did was prohibit ATF from acting. 925(c)'s judicial review procedure is still in effect. The question is whether the -- whether Congress's directive to ATF not to even act upon applications for relief constitutes a denial and, as I say, ATF is barred from either granting or denying relief, and I would refer the Court also to the general definition of agency action under the APA, which we cite in our brief. This is 5 U.S.C. 551(13). It defines agency action as an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent, or the denial thereof, or a failure to act. So under the APA, which is the general statute governing traditional review of agency action, Congress itself has defined a denial of relief as something different from a failure to act, and I think there's every reason to look at 925(c)'s reference to a denial as being consistent, rather than inconsistent with the general definitions that Congress has applied under the APA. I would also add, though, that it doesn't matter, that even if the ATF's decision were viewed as a denial within the meaning of 925(c), the general APA standards for reviewing that denial still apply. As we point out in our brief, this Court's decision in Zurko and the prior decision in the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers both make clear that, even where you do have a special statutory review procedure that establishes the form for judicial review, the nature and character, as the Court said in Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, of that judicial review is defined by the general provisions of the APA, section 706; and again, under those provisions the court can only set aside agency action that is contrary to law; and again, here, the ATF's action was compelled by law, not contrary to it. So whichever avenue this suit was thought to have been brought under, there was no basis for the district court to grant relief at all, and we also think that that is entirely consistent with the Congress's purposes in enacting the appropriations bar. The legislative history which respondent has produced as an appendix to his brief explains that Congress had become concerned about the inherently subjective nature of the inquiry that ATF was undertaking, and the severe consequences that could result if ATF had made a mistake, and also that Congress believed that the money that was being spent for that purpose, $4 million a year for 40 positions at ATF, would be better served --"

  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Well, what it decided to do is to proceed on an annual basis. It would -- which means it could be subject to revision each year. It was a practical compromise. The Third Circuit explained in Pontarelli that the same people who were supporting a permanent repeal in 1992 were also the movants for the annual appropriations rider on the theory that it accomplished essentially the same thing on an annual basis."

Respondent has not pursued that avenue, and we think it would manifestly not be arbitrary and capricious for the Secretary to withdraw that delegation and take on that function himself with all the other functions that are before the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to the Nation's economy and banking and all those other matters, and in particular it would not be arbitrary and capricious for the Secretary to decline to do that in the face of the appropriations bar that Congress has enacted, with the -- again, with the clear understanding that it didn't want these applications to be acted on administratively, but in any event --"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Excuse me. That's correct, but it would -- but even the admission or acceptance of additional evidence would be in aid of the APA review, which is, again, of the agency's decision. A court receiving evidence is not unheard of under the APA, even under the arbitrary and capricious standard. As this Court pointed out in Overton Park, occasionally there will be situations in which additional evidence or an explanation from the agency could be received in judicial review, but that's only supplemental of the record that was before the agency."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "Well, but the agency doesn't always have to make a record. I mean, suppose the agency just, you know, just makes a decision. Why can't this Court treat it as a matter of review? That is, the issue before the Court will be whether the action here, assuming it's a denial, was unreasonable?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "The question before the Court would be whether it was arbitrary and capricious or unlawful, and again, it wasn't unlawful because Congress compelled it. Congress compelled the Secretary or ATF not to act on the application. Now, whether or not that's called a denial, the bottom line, the failure to afford any relief, was compelled by Congress, so the agency could not set -- or, excuse me, the court could not set that aside. Looked at another way, the only relevant evidence that would be introduced in court would be evidence of the fact that respondent had applied during a time when the statutory bar on ATF's action was pending. That is the only relevant evidence that --"

Individuals may apply to, quote, unquote, \"the Secretary\" for relief from firearms disabilities and, if the Secretary denies that application, they may secure judicial review. The obvious flaw in the Government's position this morning, as several of the later questions identified, is that Congress has never, expressly or impliedly repealed those rights vis a vis the Secretary. The appropriations statutes that are before you address only the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Congress has set aside a separate and special budget for the Department of the Treasury generally, which is under the control of the Secretary, it's for $123 million, and the right to proceed before the Secretary is unaffected."

It is addressed to the Secretary, but it's care of Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and Congress passes all kinds of laws giving the Secretary authority to do this or that, which the Secretary invariably delegates, and I can't think of an instance where a regime of this order is taken over by the Secretary herself, rather than by some delegatee, but this is the kind of thing that's made to order for, not the top person, but for it to be delegated."

The Attorney General is required to personally certify any person who's going to be subject to the Federal death penalty. That's 42 U.S.C. -- 18 U.S.C. 3593. Under the Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act, which is 42 U.S.C. 1997(a), the Attorney General is required to personally certify a prosecution, and there are various Federal criminal prosecutions for civil rights violations, which are at 18 U.S.C. 245."

What Congress did not say -- and this is extraordinarily important. It's the key to the entire case.

We didn't have a choice, but to make perfectly clear that it was directed to the Secretary we say, we send it to the Secretary care of ATF. But I need to return to Justice Souter's question, which is, is it good enough in this case, as in many other instances of statutory construction, to say, we get the general sense of what Congress was trying to do?

We believe this is a safety valve. We're not saying that the Secretary has to grant any particular application. What we're saying is that Congress recognized that there would be extraordinary cases. What Congress was faced with was that ATF had spent $20 million granting 3,000 applications, and that's what the legislative history shows that Congress was trying to cut off. What we are describing is a very different animal.  It is an animal that's in the text of the statute, and that is, the Secretary is still empowered to grant relief. Now, Justice Ginsburg, one of the premises of your question was that there's a delegation here. The delegation here is not exclusive. The delegation here provides that -- and this was in 19 -- when the BATF was created, the Secretary provided that the Director shall act under the general supervision of the Secretary and under -- excuse me, and under the supervision of the Assistant Secretary. The parallel that's drawn by the Solicitor General is to United States v. Nixon and to the Accardi case, and those were exclusive delegations. In United States v. Nixon this Court said -- and this is at page 695 of the opinion -- that the special prosecutor had plenary authority, and the regulation provided that the Attorney General shall not interfere with the special prosecutor's decision, and in Accardi, and this is at page 266, the Court said that -- the scheme in Accardi was that the Attorney General would act only after the Bureau of Immigration Affairs, and that clearly contemplated that the AG would stay out of the process. In any event, not only is this not an exclusive delegation, but our fundamental point is that it's an illegal delegation. "

Looking at it from the perspective of a court, you seem to be making of the district court an entity that doesn't exist in the U.S. system. You're having the district court in effect being an examining magistrate. There is no adverse party. You're having the district court determine whether there's sufficient evidence to warrant restoring the license. We don't have district judges performing that kind of mixed function, proceeding in that ex parte way. It would be extraordinary for Congress to make such a provision, and yet you want us to infer it."

Let me deal with them in the following terms: was there a denial here, second, does it matter whether there was a denial here, and third, is it sufficient that the Government's position and interpretation is reasonable, as opposed to compelled by the statutory language? The plain meaning of the word denial is a refusal to grant the relief requested. Our position is that when ATF turns around and sends us a letter saying, we're not going to act, that is -- it's not a failure to act, it's a refusal to act. That is a denial, and I can point to their own regulation that means it must be so. Under subsection (i)(1)(3) of the governing regulation, which unfortunately is not reproduced in any of the documents -- we do cite it, I apologize, but it is not quoted in any of the appendices. Under that provision, ATF said that any person who is a firearms licensee -- let me briefly draw the distinction here, and that is, there are people who are allowed to have firearms under State law, but there are federally licensed dealers, importers, collectors. In the latter class, any person who submits an application to ATF is allowed to continue operating for 30 days, until 30 days after the denial. If the Government is -- and that's a quote, of the denial of the application. If the Government is correct here, it would make the profoundly -- have the profoundly illogical consequence that no licensed collector has ever been denied, and they all have the right to continue operating."

The question back to us is, well, maybe the Secretary didn't act here. My point is, that doesn't matter. The question presented by -- before this Court, if I could take you to it, is that -- is fundamentally, and this is the text of it, whether a Federal district court has the authority to grant relief. The Government has never contended, again, in the district court that there was an insufficient premise for us to be in district court. The question before this Court is whether or not the right -- excuse me, the provision for judicial review in section 925(c) has been repealed, and that takes us back to your third question, Justice Breyer, or third subsidiary one, and that is, is it enough -- and this is Justice Souter's point. Isn't it enough for us to recognize basically what Congress was after here, and I will turn to the answer. It is no. TVA v. Hill, Will, Robertson, many other, Dickerson, of this Court's precedents make perfectly clear, and this was the question that Justice Scalia started out with, that an appropriations repeal has to be categorical. The conflict between the two statutes, section 925(c) and the appropriations law, have to be irreconcilable, and that is not the case here."

The agency says, we have no authority to act. When a court says, we don't have authority to act, it's not granting or denying the relief requested, so isn't that the proper way to look at what the agency is doing? When it says, we have no authority to act, it isn't granting or denying. And then on the court, the court said, Congress set us up to be a court of review, not first view. The agency hasn't looked at it because it says it has no authority to do it. Congress did not give us the authority, ever, to take a first view of this."

The very best we think that the Government can get out of this argument is a judgment of this Court that says we were entitled to a remand to the Secretary. When we came to Federal district court and asked for relief, the best the Government could do was an order that says, no, you should have acted. What can't be the case, we believe, is that the Secretary would be able to just let these things pile up on his desk and say, I've never denied them, tough. Now, the -- what we take --"

The provision that Mr. Kneedler is quoting to you, 5 U.S.C. 703, says that the form of an action under the APA shall be the special review provision provided by statute, and that's section 925(c).

It's perfectly obvious. And so a Secretary who said, I'm not going to enforce this statute because Congress doesn't want me to even though there's a literal way I could do it without technically violating the actual language of the prohibition, does the Secretary have the right to do that?

That will be up to the Secretary. The Secretary will get to decide, and if he's granting too many applications, Congress will come along and say, no funding under this or any other act shall be expended to investigate or act on appropriation, on 925(c) applications. The critical thing, and the -- is that the Government does not dispute that this appropriations rider ever since 1993 is in the subdivision that applies only to ATF. If you want to talk about Congress working, they need clear instructions. We can't have the executive branch out here saying, I don't really like this statute, and so I'm going to infer that it's been repealed, and we can't have the courts doing that, too.

Remember, as I quoted to you from the findings of fact, the Government left the playing field here. It admitted that with all of the evidence we had, no one could reasonably dispute that Tommy Bean was perfectly entitled and represented no threat. The only question -- they participated on the fact side of the case. Their only argument that they attempted to advance was that the district court was powerless to do anything at all.

And given the absence of that, the Secretary's under a statute that tells him, act, and moreover, he adds, this is a very bad way to repeal a statute, that really under normal legislative principles if they want to repeal it, repeal it; and therefore it isn't wrong for us to consider this literally in this circumstance.

    "speech": "There's -- first of all, let me make another point which I think goes very much to the Secretary's authority. We point out on page 4 and 5 of our reply brief general principles of appropriations law that are really a particular application of the general principle that the specific governs the general, and under appropriations law, when Congress appropriates a pot of money for a particular task, that's all that can be spent for that task. Money can't be drawn from some other pot to perform that task. We think that principle should apply a fortiori, or at least it's a reasonable interpretation for the Secretary to make, that when Congress has prohibited the expenditure of any funds by the agency to whom the Secretary has delegated that authority, that Congress did not expect money to be drawn from some other pot. That is a general principle of appropriations law. At the very least, the Secretary should be given the opportunity --"

    "speech": "There are a number of Comptroller General opinions that we cite at the bottom of page 4 of our reply brief, and it's against principles like that that agencies always act in deciding how they're going to spend money. But if this argument was going to be made, the right disposition would be to present it to the Secretary, so the Secretary can construe this statute, just like all the other statutes that need to be administered, and the way to do that --"

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "It's one thing to say that when Congress says we give $500,000 to subunit B to perform this function, you cannot use $2 million from somewhere else to perform the same function. That's one thing. It's something quite different, however, to say that when you have forbidden one unit from doing something, and there is a general statute which allows the Secretary to do it, that that prohibition also applies to the Secretary. I just don't think it's parallel."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Well, at the very least it would not be arbitrary and capricious for the Secretary to decline to withdraw the delegation. That, we think, is the question that would arise in that situation, because the Secretary now may not act on these applications. He -- the ATF acts under the general direction of the Secretary, but if the Secretary directed ATF to grant one of these applications, he would be directing an illegal act. He would have to withdraw the delegation. He hasn't been asked by respondent to do that, which would require a petition for rulemaking. The Secretary, in deciding whether to take this power back to himself, could at the very least take into account what Congress has said about not wanting these applications to be acted upon by ATF, and also the reasons the Congress gave, which is that this is a very subjective undertaking, with high risk, and Congress decided, we don't want this function being performed because of the potential consequences. We want this money to be used for other purposes in fighting crime. All of that would make it entirely reasonable for the Secretary not to take on this function himself. The other important point to notice is that --"

  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "He does not -- nothing in the statute says that the Secretary must act on applications. It says the Secretary may grant relief. It does not require him to grant relief, and the Secretary could very easily withhold action, which is, after all, what Congress required ATF to do."

    "speaker": "QUESTION",
    "speech": "What, on the ground that it's like the pardon power, it's like a matter of grace, or something like that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "Yes, very much so. It's -- it's, or, as the Court said four or five terms ago in the Yang case that we cite in our brief with respect to relief from deportation, it is exactly like the pardon power, and it's written in very broad terms. It establishes several preconditions, whether the person would be dangerous to the public safety, and whether granting it would not be contrary to the public interest, and even then the Secretary is not required to grant relief. This is a very broad discretionary power, and I think it ties into what Justice Ginsburg was asking earlier, wouldn't this be an extraordinary power to give to the Federal district courts. Indeed it would, because the question is not just whether the person might be dangerous, but whether granting relief would be contrary to the public interest. That's not the sort of determination a court can make in the first instance. It's something that Congress has assigned to the Secretary. In this case, even if respondent is correct that he wouldn't be dangerous, it doesn't follow that restoration of firearms abilities would be consistent with the public interest. That's a judgment that Congress invested in the Secretary, not in the courts, and as Justice Kennedy pointed out, ATF could not investigate an application for relief in connection with a judicial proceeding any more than it could in an administrative proceeding. The ATF agent who testified in this case was one of respondent's witnesses. He was not called by the Government."

    "speech": "Well, that would be -- we did not object, the Government did not object in the district court to his testifying. He was just testifying as to what he had looked up in the records, but an investigation involves far more than that. In fact, the AUSA in this case cross-examined Mr. Bean and a couple of other witnesses, but that's far short of the investigation that Congress expected ATF to undertake when it was performing these functions, and that it did undertake, which involved an investigation of the crime, neighbors, not just the people whom respondent has put forward, but ATF would go out and develop its own independent leads. None of that capability exists when the Government is responding to an application filed in court. So for these reasons we think it is --"

Do you think the Secretary's authority under the statute is broad enough so, even without any act of Congress or anything in the appropriation, the Secretary could have adopted a policy, we would rather use our money on other purposes and so we're not going to process any applications?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KNEEDLER",
    "speech": "I do believe it's -- it is broad enough. I think the Secretary -- all it says is, the Secretary may grant relief. I think the Secretary could decide, and in fact the regulations, 144(d) has some categorical exclusions that the Secretary had adopted but the district court in this case ignored. Even -- we think the court couldn't act at all, but it even ignored the standards that the Secretary had adopted in the public interest to implement what would be a public interest standard under the statute. The district court ignored them, so we think that the Secretary could make a categorical determination not to grant relief."
