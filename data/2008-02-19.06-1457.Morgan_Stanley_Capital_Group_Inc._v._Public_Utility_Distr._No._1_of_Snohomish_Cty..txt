1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:04 a.m.) 3 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'll repeat myself. I 4 didn't have the mike on. The Court will hear argument 5 in Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc., against Snohomish 6 Public Utility District No. 1, or Public District -7 Snohomish County No. 1. 8 Mr. Kneedler. 9 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 10 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FERC, 11 IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS 12 MR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Justice Stevens, 13 and may it please the Court: 14 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 15 this case reasonably denied Respondent's request to 16 modify the wholesale contracts that the purchasing power 17 companies had entered into in 2000 and 2001. The 18 Commission reasonably concluded that Respondents had not 19 made the requisite showing under the Federal Power Act 20 and under this Court's decisions in Mobile and Sierra 21 that modification of the contracts was necessary in the 22 public interest. 23 In reaching that conclusion, FERC first drew 24 on three factors that this Court had identified in 25 Sierra and found that they were not satisfied. Thus, it
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 found that Respondents had failed to show that the 2 contracts would impose financial strain on the 3 purchasing companies; that it would impose excessive 4 burdens on the customers; or that they were unduly 5 discriminatory. But FERC also looked -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But FERC thought it could 7 live with the Ninth Circuit's decision, because the 8 government recommended that we deny cert in this case; 9 isn't that so? 10 MR. KNEEDLER: That is -- that is correct, 11 and FERC thought that perhaps the decision could be 12 limited to the circumstances arising out of the 13 California energy crisis in the years 2000- 2001, and 14 that it could channel its concerns about contract 15 stability through those other factors. 16 But, nonetheless, FERC believes, as its 17 decisions make clear and as our position in this Court 18 makes clear, that the Ninth Circuit's reformulation of 19 the Mobile-Sierra doctrine or interpretation of the act 20 was incorrect. And, now that the Court has granted 21 review, we urge affirmance of FERC's decision in this 22 case. 23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't it clear to the 24 government that the Ninth Circuit, which is what, about 25 10 percent of the country, was going to continue this
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 interpretation of the act, and that was not a matter of 2 any consequence to FERC or to the government? 3 MR. GARRE: It was of consequence, but FERC 4 still believed it had some interpretive authority after 5 the decision. Maybe this was a wrong judgment at the 6 time, but FERC thought that it still had some 7 interpretive authority under the decision, and that it 8 could -9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Kneedler, this 10 is a decision, the Ninth Circuit decision, that empowers 11 FERC. FERC says: Oh, we don't have that authority. 12 And the Ninth Circuit said: Yes, you do. So this is an 13 agency arguing that it can't do what the Ninth Circuit 14 says it can. And why can it not? Because of two 15 decisions of this Court. Is that right? 16 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, two decisions of this 17 Court and 50 years of intervening FERC, before that 18 Federal Power Commission, practice. 19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait, wait, wait. It 20 didn't just say the agency may do it. It said the 21 agency must do it. I don't -- I don't consider "must" 22 to be an empowerment. I consider that to be a 23 direction. 24 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. That -- that is 25 correct. I mean it, I think -- I took the question to
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 be that it might give FERC broader flexibility, but at a 2 very substantial cost to the stability of contracts, 3 which was the underlying point that this Court stressed 4 in its decision in Sierra: That the Federal Power Act, 5 unlike -- and the Natural Gas Act, unlike the Interstate 6 Commerce Act, contemplates that rates will be set by 7 contract, or at least can be set by contract; and that 8 therefore, like in most situations, a party to a 9 contract cannot unilaterally walk away from that 10 contract or insist upon its modification because it may 11 become disadvantageous over time. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- let's go 13 back a step. I thought FERC's position was: We could 14 not decide as a matter of discretion to do this because 15 we are limited by those Supreme Court decisions. 16 MR. GARRE: Well, FERC -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's not what FERC -18 FERC independently interpreting the statute to reach the 19 conclusion, which it might, to reach the conclusion the 20 Ninth Circuit did. It's FERC saying: We can't do that 21 because we have our marching orders from the Supreme 22 Court. 23 MR. KNEEDLER: No. I think -- I mean there 24 are -- there are two interpretive questions here: When 25 does the public interest standard identified in this
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Court's decisions in Mobile and Sierra apply? And then 2 there is the further question of what is necessary to 3 satisfy the public interest standard for modifying a 4 contract. 5 We think on both points the Commission's 6 decision in this case reflects an interpretive judgment 7 that the Court's decision, or the interpretation 8 reflected in the Court's decision, in Sierra applies 9 equally in the market-based rate system without any of 10 the -- either of the two prerequisites that the Ninth 11 Circuit formulated as a precondition to applying the 12 public interest standard. 13 And I would point the Court's attention, in 14 the joint appendix in the Commission's decision, to 15 joint appendix 1244 and 1245, repeated again at 1572 and 16 1573; and also the passage quoted in the Morgan Stanley 17 brief at page 17, reflects a determination of what the 18 Commission's longstanding policy has been that, 19 contracts once entered into, their integrity must be 20 protected and should not be lightly set aside. 21 And also, the Commission specifically 22 rejected at pages 1564 and 1565 of the joint appendix 23 the prerequisites that the Ninth Circuit came up with in 24 this case, that there must be an opportunity to 25 determine whether the rates were within a zone of just
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 and reasonableness at the time the contracts were 2 entered into in order for Mobile and Sierra to apply. 3 Under a market-based rate system, what FERC 4 does is determine at the outset when an applicant 5 applies for a market-based tariff whether that company 6 has market power and if so, whether it's mitigated. 7 Only in those circumstances is the company granted the 8 authority to market -- to set prices by the market. 9 JUSTICE ALITO: What happens if that 10 approval is given and then a seller enters into 11 contracts and then it's later discovered that, contrary 12 to what FERC thought when it granted the approval, the 13 seller has exercised market power or has otherwise 14 manipulated the market? Is there any remedy in that 15 situation? 16 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, what the Commission 17 determined in this case is that there was -- there was 18 no manipulation or exercise of market power identified 19 with respect to these specific contracts. And what the 20 Commission decided was that the importance of the 21 integrity of contracts in that circumstance required 22 that the contract be maintained. If the Respondents had 23 shown bad faith or something like that in the 24 connection -- or fraud in connection with the formation 25 of these particular contracts, that would have been
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 quite a different matter. 2 It's also important to note that the 3 Commission found in this case that there was no 4 dysfunction in the forward market, which is what we have 5 here. What was going on is that there was dysfunction 6 in the spot market in 2000, 2001 for a variety of 7 reasons, some of them going to market fundamentals such 8 as a shortage of generation capacity, a shortage of 9 hydropower. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just so I understand your 11 answer to Justice Alito's question, the Commission has 12 retroactive authority to alter the permission to engage 13 in these contracts only if there is fraud -14 MR. KNEEDLER: No it can -- I'm sorry -15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- or something similar? 16 MR. KNEEDLER: Once it has granted 17 market-based rate authority, FERC can revoke that. And 18 in fact, companies -- there is a triennial review of 19 that -20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Retroactive? 21 MR. KNEEDLER: Pardon? 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Retroactively? 23 MR. KNEEDLER: No. It would be revoked -24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Justice Alito's 25 question, I think as I understood it, or at least a
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 question in my mind that followed upon it, was whether 2 or not -- what's the basis for any retroactive 3 revocation of that or -4 MR. KNEEDLER: No, it wouldn't be 5 retroactive. It would be from the date of the complaint 6 that was filed. 7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would it be a public 8 interest finding, a finding that because of the market 9 manipulation by the seller that affected this very 10 contract, the public interest demands that we not hold 11 the -12 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. In that situation there 13 is an important public interest in eliminating fraud. 14 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't say fraud. I said 15 market manipulation. 16 MR. KNEEDLER: Or market manipulation. 17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the remedy for the 18 finding of market manipulation the abrogation of the 19 contract, which is a separate process from, from the 20 revocation of market-based tariff? 21 MR. KNEEDLER: There are. And this is the 22 point I was going to make -23 JUSTICE SOUTER: The same reason may support 24 each, but -25 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. I was going to make
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 that point in response to Justice Kennedy's question. 2 If it turns out that subsequent evidence shows that a 3 particular company has acquired market-based power, then 4 FERC can revoke that authority on a going-forward basis 5 to continue to sell on that basis. And in fact, 6 companies are required to report any changes in their 7 circumstances that might affect their market power, and 8 there is a triennial review of that. But as long ago 9 the market -10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the companies who 11 were involved in this case make those reports? I mean, 12 there was something about during this energy crisis 13 there was rampant noncompliance with the filing, with 14 the quarterly report filing. 15 MR. KNEEDLER: There was, and the Ninth 16 Circuit found that in the Lockyer decision. But that is 17 the sort of flaw and market oversight that should be 18 addressed directly by FERC. It shouldn't be -- it 19 shouldn't be addressed by collateral attacks on 20 contracts that were entered into under the regulatory 21 regime as it existed. 22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, I'm not 23 entirely understanding you. Why should the fact that 24 the seller later acquired market power have anything to 25 do with whether the initial contract, when he did not
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 have market power, was a fair one? The contracts are 2 already down in black and white, his later acquisition 3 of market power cannot affect -4 MR. KNEEDLER: No, that is certainly 5 correct. I think the question, what concerned the Ninth 6 Circuit -- actually, the Ninth Circuit wasn't addressing 7 market power. It was addressing the possibility of 8 market dysfunction. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. But later 10 acquisition of market power would result in a 11 cancellation of the permission for this particular firm 12 to enter into contracts for the future, but I don't see 13 why it would affect the past contracts. 14 MR. KNEEDLER: And we don't think it should, 15 except to the extent the public interest standard is 16 met. 17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe I think I led us into 18 this, Mr. Kneedler. The situation that I was positing 19 was a situation in which the power marketer had engaged 20 in market manipulation in the context of which, at the 21 time of which, it made this contract. And my suggestion 22 to you, which I think you took, was that in a situation 23 like that there would be a basis for public interest 24 review and abrogation of this contract because of the 25 market manipulation in fact.
13

1 And the market manipulation would also be a 2 reason to say market power had been acquired. It had 3 not been mitigated, and hence, the market-based tariff 4 authority would also be revoked. And that was the, that 5 was the limit of my question. And I take it your answer 6 there is it could do each of those things? 7 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. It could revoke the 8 market-based power going forward. And with respect to 9 manipulation, especially if there was manipulation 10 affecting the particular contract, that would be a basis 11 for finding that the public interest required the 12 contract to be modified. 13 If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of 14 my time. 15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, I do have 16 one question. It was the position that FERC took in 17 December of 2000, when it was encouraging the entrance 18 into the long-term contracts rather than using the spot 19 market, and in that order FERC said that it would 20 monitor long-term contracts vigorously for rate 21 reasonableness and that buyers could challenge rates 22 through 206 proceedings. What happened to that 23 position? 24 MR. KNEEDLER: This is such a challenge, but 25 what FERC has concluded is that the public interest
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 standard has to be satisfied in that situation. FERC 2 encouraged parties to go into the long-term market in 3 order to diminish the market volatility and it would 4 frustrate that encouragement of policy -5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how did FERC monitor 6 the rates vigorously to make sure they were reasonable? 7 MR. KNEEDLER: There was extensive staff 8 studies and monitoring in subsequent decisions that are, 9 that are shown and that are in the joint appendix, in 10 April -- in January and April and June when FERC came up 11 with its final program to mitigate the problems in the 12 spot market. 13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dellinger. 14 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER 15 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 16 MR. DELLINGER: Justice Stevens, good 17 morning, and may it please the Court: 18 Justice Ginsburg began by asking whether the 19 Ninth Circuit decision did not in fact empower rather 20 than restrict the authority of the Commission. The 21 answer is that the Ninth Circuit decision fundamentally 22 precludes the Commission from carrying out what the 23 Commission believes is essential to its mandate to 24 assure an abundancy of electrical energy at the lowest 25 possible cost. And that is to encourage a market-based
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 approach to recognize that if you're going to have, as 2 the Commission has said, the kind of investment in the 3 building of infrastructure to produce energy, people are 4 going to have to be able to rely upon long-term 5 contracts. 6 In this case, what the Ninth Circuit's 7 decision did is to take away a very important option 8 that the Commission believes is essential in times of 9 market volatility and dysfunction. And that is the 10 option for parties to get out of the spot market and to 11 enter into a long-term contract of a secure supply. 12 If the Ninth Circuit's decision stood, 13 literally parties, buyers and sellers, would both be 14 precluded from entering into that, because you would 15 know if there were dysfunction that nothing you could 16 say in the contract could mean that you could buy power 17 for the next eight years at $105 at a time, as was the 18 case here, when the spot market was $300. It would take 19 away the option. And sellers would know they couldn't 20 enter into a contract they could rely upon subject only 21 to being overridden in the public interest, which FERC 22 does. And that would be very damaging to the very 23 processes which the Commission has used consistent with 24 this Court's decision of 50 years ago to encourage 25 development in this industry.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, those decisions are 2 puzzling transposed to this setting, because in those 3 decisions it was the seller who had made a bad bargain; 4 the price was too low; and the seller wanted to get out, 5 right? 6 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And now we are 8 transposing that. And one of the main themes I think of 9 Justice Harlan's decision was this Act was meant to 10 protect the consumer, to make sure that the consumer 11 wasn't going to be overcharged. And that runs through 12 those two 1956 decisions, at a time when there was no 13 market-based authority, or any such, right? 14 MR. DELLINGER: Well, yes. Justice 15 Ginsburg, that is correct. That was a case where a 16 seller was seeking to get out of a contract that was 17 paying too low. 18 But the fundamental purpose -- the Court 19 recognized even in Justice Harlan's opinion that 20 maintaining the stability and expectation of contracts 21 was going to be important to consumers, to buyers as 22 well as to sellers. In this -- and FERC has adopted 23 that position. 24 In this case you have a situation where the 25 Commission decided that instability in the spot markets
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 was being partly caused by the fact that the State 2 regulatory process had discouraged people from entering 3 into longer term contracts; and FERC said in its 2000 4 San Diego order, we strongly urge utilities to move 5 their load to long-term contracts of two years or more. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the same order 7 where they said we are going to monitor the rates for 8 reasonableness. 9 MR. DELLINGER: That is true. And when they 10 did indeed undertake a review of this, they decided that 11 with respect to these contracts there was no evidence of 12 bad faith. There was no evidence of unfairness. There 13 was no evidence of duress. There was no evidence of any 14 market manipulation that affected the contracts 15 specifically in these long-term cases. 16 The long-term contracts were part of the 17 solution or the mitigation of the problem. It was a 18 long-term contract that allowed the utilities in this 19 case to get out from under $300 a megawatt prices and to 20 enter into a contract at $105, in one of the cases. 21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask this question? 22 Assuming there is absolutely no bad faith or fraud or 23 anything like that, but there is just a general 24 conclusion that the market was such -- in such turmoil 25 that there could not be made reasonable or long-term
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 contracts, because the predicate for that kind of 2 negotiation just didn't exist. Would that be a basis 3 for setting aside the contract? 4 MR. DELLINGER: No; and it's very important 5 that not be a basis, because if that were the case, 6 parties would know and parties -- both -- all parties 7 were aware that there was volatility, and the Commission 8 had announced that the conditions were conducive to 9 manipulation of the spot markets. That would mean that 10 a seller would say to a buyer, we know you would like to 11 get out of this volatility and get a regular supply 12 guaranteed at a -- at a much lower price for long term. 13 We can't enter into that contract, because the fact that 14 we know there has been this problem in the market means 15 that our contract won't be upheld. 16 Now, the Ninth Circuit decision says that 17 contract terms are not binding if they were influenced 18 by a dysfunctional market; and that is the very most 19 important circumstance in which having long-term 20 contracting is most valuable. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is volatile the same as 22 dysfunctional? 23 MR. DELLINGER: Justice Kennedy, I don't 24 know precisely what the Ninth Circuit means by 25 dysfunctional. There is volatility. I think the
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 difference would be is there manipulation, is one 2 factor; there were a number of factors that caused the 3 volatility here -4 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dellinger, does that 5 mean that it is your position that no matter how 6 dysfunctional the market was, just complete turmoil, as 7 long as the contract was made in good faith without any 8 fraud or abuse of power, it's a binding contract? 9 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct, unless -10 and this is an important unless -- the Commission 11 reviews those contract terms and finds that the public 12 interest necessitates a revision of the contract. They 13 have that discretion. They have that authority. They 14 are prepared to and have exercised it, but in -- in this 15 case -16 JUSTICE SCALIA: For example -17 MR. DELLINGER: For example -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: For example, if the prices 19 down the road turn out to be so high for the utility, 20 that the utility would go out of business? 21 MR. DELLINGER: That is an example that the 22 Court gave in Mobile and -- and Sierra. But the 23 Court -- but what the Commission would know is that the 24 circumstances would have to be rather extraordinary. 25 Because whenever you were to modify the terms of a
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 contract that the sellers have been relying upon, the 2 sellers became buyers. They also went out on the 3 market. They are buying and selling. 4 So unraveling all of these buying and 5 selling would itself be -- would be dysfunctional; but 6 what sellers would know thereafter is that they couldn't 7 rely upon the contracts. They would either have to stay 8 out of that market or they would have to charge a risk 9 premium, which would raise prices to buyers and 10 consumers. 11 So that long run harm of making it less 12 reliable to engage in contracting would have to be 13 overcome by a fairly severe showing of what the 14 short-term harms would be to one particular set of 15 buyers. 16 The Commission has made those findings. 17 They found circumstances where the contracts gave first 18 priority to commercial uses of power, and at a time of 19 shortage that meant that residential customers would be 20 cut off. The Commission ordered that done. 21 The Commission has been on the job here. 22 They have -- the process by which they grant 23 market-based rate authority is an elaborate one. They 24 get assurances that the sellers lack transmission market 25 power, generation market power, that there are no
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 barriers to entry, that if they have transmission 2 facilities there is open access. They -- any party can 3 challenge that. And any party in this case, any party 4 in this case -5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said the Commission 6 is on the job, but one of the pieces of information here 7 is that the Commission staff said that the dysfunction 8 in the spot market carried over into the forward market, 9 such that prices in the forward market were inflated. 10 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. But what 11 the Commission realized is that the parties were aware 12 of what was going on in the spot market. They were able 13 to contract on that basis. They could have asked for 14 what's called a Memphis clause, giving either party the 15 right to seek modification based on some administrative 16 determination of what a right price would be at some 17 later point. They did not. They kept in the clauses 18 that allowed only joint approaches to the Commission, 19 and indeed in one contract said that the rates are fixed 20 and shall remain in effect for the terms of this 21 agreement. That language is illustrative of how you 22 could not enter into a long-term contract and assure 23 that the terms were binding. The fact that -24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what 25 that statement means, anyway. The current dysfunction
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 carries over into -- into the future market? What does 2 that mean? 3 MR. DELLINGER: Right. Well -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it mean that because 5 of the current dysfunction, you can't predict for sure 6 what the rates are going to be down the road? Of course 7 it means that. But doesn't a dysfunction always mean 8 that? 9 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. Dysfunction -10 JUSTICE SCALIA: And isn't that why you 11 enter into long-term contracts? 12 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. Yes. 13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because given the current 14 dysfunction you have no idea what the price is going to 15 be down the road. 16 MR. DELLINGER: That's exactly right. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dellinger, wasn't the 18 staff saying something more than that in that -- in that 19 report? 20 MR. DELLINGER: I don't -- I don't know what 21 you're intimating, but what the conclusion was of the 22 Commission was, for example, that there was no basis to 23 support a finding that the Respondents exercised market 24 -25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Commission didn't
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 -- didn't respond to the staff report, right? Didn't 2 say anything one way or another about it. 3 MR. DELLINGER: Well, the Commission 4 expressly said with respect to the -- to the staff 5 report that there was no evidence of any manipulation. 6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did they say it with 7 respect to the staff report? Or -- I thought they 8 thought the staff report was irrelevant? 9 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. The aspect of the 10 staff report that said that forward prices were 11 influenced by prices in the spot market and that there 12 had been dysfunction was irrelevant precisely because it 13 would have been relevant were the Commission making its 14 own bureaucratic determination of a right price. But 15 the parties made the determination of the prices that 16 they wanted to agree to, the terms they wanted to agree 17 to, and they did so with full knowledge both that they 18 knew there had been some manipulation, that there was 19 volatility and that they knew they didn't know, as 20 Justice Scalia, said the extent of it; and, therefore, 21 that's precisely why you want to be involved in a 22 contract that guarantees you today that, no matter what 23 happens to prices in the next year or next summer, one 24 of these -- one of these utilities has a guarantee of 25 power at $105.

1 market-based rate program. Do you -- do you acknowledge 2 that that is permissible interpretation of the Federal 3 Power Act or not? 4 MR. WRIGHT: I -- there is much that we 5 don't disagree with about the market-based rate program. 6 I suppose we do think that there are two things that 7 FERC has to make sure that it does as part of that 8 program. 9 First, in -- in approving the market-based 10 rate program, Judge Douglas Ginsburg said when there is 11 a competitive market, FERC may rely upon market-based 12 rates in lieu of cost-of-service regulations. That 13 makes perfect sense to us, but when there is a 14 competitive market. So we think a critical part of a 15 market-based rate program is that there must be an 16 inquiry into whether or not the market was competitive 17 when the contract was entered into. Of course, we have 18 the unusual circumstance here where Professor Kahn and 19 nine other deregulatory economists wrote a letter in May 20 2001 saying markets are out of control, this is the 21 unusual circumstance where FERC should enter a price 22 cap. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it -- isn't it a 24 central requirement of a market-based rate program that 25 FERC cannot, except perhaps in very limited
26

1 circumstances, go back and undo contracts that had been 2 entered into under that program, based on a 3 retrospective determination that the rates are not just 4 and reasonable, in the same sense that FERC would have 5 applied that term if the utility had simply filed a 6 tariff? 7 MR. WRIGHT: Justice Alito, all rates must 8 be just and reasonable. We are not arguing that FERC 9 needs to go back to a cost-of-service ratemaking 10 approach; but an agency that sees just and reasonable 11 and thinks it's applying a just and reasonable standard, 12 for 70 years has thought it's either going to do a 13 cost-of-service approach, or more recently it's going to 14 rely on the market to make rates just and reasonable, 15 our modest point is that it can't ignore the market. It 16 -17 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I guess this is 18 what's bothering us. Your point does not seem, at least 19 to me, to be a modest point, because if I understand 20 where you're going, you're saying that in a market with 21 the degree of volatility of this one at the time these 22 contracts were made, no contract is enforceable. It 23 will last only so long as -- as one party does not 24 complain about a disadvantage, and the minute it does, 25 it's back in front of FERC. And the argument is being
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 made that in fact a market-based rate cannot be enforced 2 through contract because the very premise -- i.e., what 3 you call and what was called a competitive -- Judge 4 Ginsburg called a competitive market -- was absent. 5 Isn't that the consequence of what you're arguing? 6 MR. WRIGHT: Yes. Let me make four points 7 here, though, that I think make absolutely clear that it 8 would not set a broad precedent to revisit the contracts 9 here. 10 And the four points are first, the 11 Government acknowledges in its brief at page 16, this 12 was the worst electricity market crisis in history. 13 Second -14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how do we know when 15 we're only in the second worst? 16 (Laughter.) 17 MR. WRIGHT: Well -18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but I mean the 19 problem is -20 MR. WRIGHT: No, no -21 JUSTICE SOUTER: And I don't see any -- and 22 I realize that you're giving me limiting principles to 23 what seems to me in effect a general rule that says no 24 contracts are enforceable, if they are made during 25 periods of market volatility, however sensible they may
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 be given the premise of that volatility. 2 And your first proposal for a limiting 3 principle is this is the worst of times, and I don't see 4 how that's going to help because somebody is always 5 going to claim, well, these times are -- are almost as 6 bad. 7 MR. WRIGHT: Well, Your Honor, of course the 8 Federal Power Act instructs a Federal agency to ensure 9 that rates are just and reasonable. A -- the Federal 10 Power Act -11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Look -12 MR. WRIGHT: The FERC, FERC needs to grapple 13 with this. 14 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's a good -- I mean 15 that's a fine general phrase, but the question is, is it 16 possible to make an enforceable contract under these 17 circumstances? 18 MR. WRIGHT: Well -19 JUSTICE SOUTER: I haven't heard a limiting 20 principle yet. You have three others. 21 MR. WRIGHT: I have three others. There was 22 rampant noncompliance with the reporting requirements. 23 The Government concedes that, too: FERC's market-based 24 rate program, however well it might work today after 25 it's been improved, as the Government said in its
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 opposition to cert, however well it's been improved on 2 account of the 2005 amendments -3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Did these -- did -- did the 4 Petitioners here -- do you claim that the Petitioners 5 here were guilty of failure to report? 6 MR. WRIGHT: Yes. They -- they were not -7 they were not complying with the -- we contend that the 8 reporting requirements that were in effect in 2001 were 9 inconsistent with the statute and not -10 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- that's a 11 different issue. That -- that may be that the 12 Commission was derelict in -- in having a nonstatutory 13 condition. But did these -- did these Petitioners -- do 14 you claim, is it a basis for your claim before FERC, 15 that these Petitioners failed to follow the reporting 16 requirements that were in effect? 17 MR. WRIGHT: Our -- our basic argument is 18 the rates weren't just and reasonable -19 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's what I thought. 20 MR. WRIGHT: And the rates weren't just and 21 reasonable on the day the contracts were signed. And 22 let me make clear -23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but here I just want 24 to make sure I understand. You're saying one -- one 25 limiting principle is the re-examination of contract
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 might be limited or at least only prompted by a -- a 2 failure to follow reporting requirements. I can 3 understand that and that offhand seems to me perfectly 4 fair. It may not cover this case, but I can understand 5 that. What are your other two reasons? 6 MR. WRIGHT: My third is, as Commissioner 7 Massey stated in his dissent, without contradiction by 8 the majority, that if the just and reasonable standard 9 were -- would be applied, these rates would be declared 10 unlawful, because they were multiples of traditional 11 prices. 12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but that seems to me 13 consistent with the problem that I have with your 14 argument. And that is, if you make a contract in a 15 period of high volatility, and it seems reasonable to 16 the two parties to come up with a rate that is certainly 17 a higher rate than anybody would come up with if they 18 were going through cost-plus-return ratemaking, the 19 contract is vulnerable. And it seems to me that 20 Commissioner Massey's argument is consistent with the 21 conclusion that all those contracts are vulnerable. So 22 I don't see that as any limiting principle. What's your 23 fourth one? 24 MR. WRIGHT: The fourth one is, as Justice 25 Ginsburg has noted, that FERC said in December 2000,
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 before all of the contracts at issue were negotiated, 2 that it would monitor and -- and would -- deems rates 3 above $74 suspect. All the contracts in here have rates 4 above that benchmark. So it's the worst crisis in 5 history; there's rampant noncompliance; rates were 6 multiples of traditional pricings, and FERC had said it 7 was going to study these rates closely. 8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, I can understand -9 under your fourth point, I could understand the position 10 if the argument were this is above $74, and therefore it 11 is suspect; but the claim you're making, as I understand 12 it, is a much broader claim. You're saying the entire 13 contract ought to be abrogated in the public interest, 14 not merely above 74 but below 74. Isn't that correct? 15 MR. WRIGHT: Well, I'm sorry, Your Honor. 16 We want this case to be sent back to FERC. 17 JUSTICE SOUTER: And when you get there, 18 you're saying abrogate this contract. 19 MR. WRIGHT: We are saying reduce the rates, 20 and -21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Are you saying -- have you 22 at any point said reduce the rates to $74? 23 MR. WRIGHT: I'm sure different -- there are 24 many different parties on my side. I'm sure we have 25 many different theories. Could I tell you what FERC 's

It's helped me get out what I think 7 our four points -8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- if your theory 9 prevails and you go back to the Commission, does the 10 Morgan Stanley contract, where the lower rate seller 11 was, does that get reevaluated, too? You reevaluate all 12 the contracts back down the line? 13 MR. WRIGHT: Well, I -- does Morgan 14 Stanley's -- well, Morgan Stanley actually -- a number 15 of parties in Morgan Stanley's situation chose to file 16 protective actions, and Morgan Stanley didn't. So I 17 don't know whether it has waived its rights or not. But 18 I think FERC ought to grapple with that. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me say that, 20 consistent with your theory, that everybody -- that this 21 whole unwinding process backs up all the way down to the 22 original seller? 23 MR. WRIGHT: Right. 24 Well, Your Honor, the way these markets 25 work, there is every reason to think that Morgan Stanley
33
Alderson Reporting Company

1 doesn't have the sort of claim that they have suggested 2 without telling us they have. And, of course, they know 3 what their portfolio is. 4 There is every reason to think they bought 5 power before the big spike came, and that they bought 6 power since then, and that they're not -- they're not 7 buying power at 104 and selling it to Snohomish at 105, 8 Your Honor. 9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, good for them. 10 (Laughter.) 11 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean you're suggesting 12 they should be punished for that? I don't understand 13 what -- what follows? I mean -14 MR. WRIGHT: We're not, Your Honor, but I 15 would remind you this is a plain-language case. The 16 statute requires rates to be just and reasonable. That 17 -- for 70 years, that's meant something to 18 administrative agencies. The reason -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how would you -- how 20 would you go about determining in this case? You said 21 it's not the traditional cost of service, return on 22 investment. So how -- if you prevail, what should FERC 23 do to determine whether this rate was fair and 24 reasonable? 25 MR. WRIGHT: Thank you, Your Honor.

1 We expect that, ultimately, it will do, or 2 should do, what it's done with respect to the spot 3 market. With respect to the spot market, it has 4 provided relief to parties who bought at the same time. 5 And what it has done is it has -- it has determined what 6 it calls a mitigated market clearing price. 7 It has done this with great elaborate -8 elaboration for periods as low as 10 minutes for the 9 period in 2000 - 2001, when it is now conceded 10 manipulation raised rates on the spot market. And it 11 has taken the prices that were paid, and it has -- it 12 has reduced them to what it calls the "mitigated market 13 clearing price." 14 This is -- this is described in painful 15 detail in the -- in the Ninth Circuit's 2006 CPUC versus 16 FERC opinion. 17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't your clients know 18 that the market was chaotic at the time they entered 19 into this long-term contract? I mean does this come as 20 a surprise that after the fact, now that you're paying 21 more than the market price is, you want to kick over a 22 long-term contract you entered into? 23 What has changed? Did you not know that the 24 market was chaotic? Wasn't that the very reason you 25 entered into the long-term contract.

1 MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, we had a sort of a 2 Henry Ford choice. Any -- we had a choice of a variety 3 of rates as long as they were unjust and unreasonable. 4 We didn't have any alternative, because of the market 5 manipulation, that allowed us to get a just and 6 reasonable rate on the spot market, on long-term markets 7 -8 JUSTICE SOUTER: You were saying that the 9 most -- the most reasonable thing for us to do was to 10 enter into a long-term contract in order to mitigate the 11 effects of the chaotic spot market. You understood 12 that. 13 MR. WRIGHT: In large part, because FERC had 14 told us they were going to monitor these contracts and 15 use the $74 benchmark. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: In fact, you did very well 17 under these contracts. Initially, you were even 18 reselling some of the energy that you got. You got it 19 at a price so much below what was then the market that 20 you made a profit by reselling it. 21 But now that things have changed, you don't 22 like the long-term contract. 23 MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, it's our position 24 that we have to prove these were just and reasonable on 25 the day they were entered. And the way these markets
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 work, local utilities like Snohomish buy energy, and 2 they always sell a little bit. They're going to lose 3 153 million over the life of this contract. And it's 4 always been the life of the contract that FERC has 5 thought was the -- the real benchmark. 6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Wright, may I go back 7 to your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question? She 8 asked you: What do you want FERC to do if it does what 9 you want them to do? 10 And you said: We want them to make the same 11 kind of adjustments ex post that they made to the spot 12 prices. 13 Isn't there one big difference here to -14 between readjusting spot prices and rewriting or 15 abrogating a contract like this? 16 In the case of adjusting the spot prices, in 17 effect. What they are saying is: Somebody isn't going 18 to make the killing that he thought he was making. It 19 was -- a spot price indicates it was a snap decision. 20 People were reacting to -- to changes in the market from 21 hour to hour. And the Commission is going to go back 22 and say, you know, you're out of luck on the killing you 23 thought you made. 24 When, on the other hand, the Commission, in 25 effect, rewrites or abrogates a contract, it is saying
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 something very different. It is saying: You may not 2 engage in long-term reliance on the agreements that you 3 make. And isn't that a huge difference? 4 MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, we think that FERC 5 could, and it seems clear that it will, distinguish 6 between the spot market and long-term contracts on these 7 bases. Our point there is that we probably, if it does, 8 then have to overcome a hurdle and show that there 9 wasn't effective competition at the time the long-term 10 contracts were entered into. 11 FERC might rationally, once it grapples with 12 this, decide that that's the way the just and reasonable 13 standard applies. 14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but with respect, 15 doesn't that, in effect, mean -- going back to your 16 answer to Justice Ginsburg -- that what you really want 17 is to say there wasn't effective competition. 18 There wasn't effective competition because 19 the market was chaotic. 20 And, therefore, in a chaotic market, 21 including this one, a long-term contract which later 22 turns out to be disadvantageous to one side is 23 unenforceable. 24 Isn't that what you -- your real answer to 25 Justice Ginsburg is.

1 MR. WRIGHT: Well, Your Honor, again, I 2 don't think we should prevail, and it's not our position 3 that we prevail, unless we show that we didn't have just 4 and reasonable alternatives at the time we entered into 5 the contract. We don't think we can -6 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I mean -- that's 7 where I don't think that, at least with me, helps your 8 argument. We all know that there is a broad umbrella 9 standard of justness and reasonableness. One index of 10 justness is the set of conditions under which the 11 parties operate. The conditions in this case were 12 conditions of chaos. 13 And what the other side is saying, I think, 14 is: We each tried to make the most reasonable deal we 15 could, the most advantageous for us that we could, under 16 these conditions of chaos. 17 They certainly produced a rate that wouldn't 18 have been produced in a calm time either by market-based 19 tariffs or by cost-plus-return ratemaking. But under 20 the circumstances that we did operate in, this is what 21 it produced. And we were dealing at arm's length. 22 Nobody was engaging in fraud, et cetera. So that's 23 just. 24 And I think when you say, as you did a 25 minute ago, there is an overarching obligation or
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 standard of justness and reasonableness, I think you're 2 saying that that reasoning that I just tried to outline 3 is not sufficient reasoning for sustaining the contract. 4 Now, if I'm wrong, tell me. 5 If I'm right, it seems to me you're really 6 saying ditch the contracts if they were entered into in 7 a period of high volatility. 8 MR. WRIGHT: Well, Your Honor, let me make 9 clear what -- what we mean by "chaos" or "high 10 volatility." We think we have to show that manipulation 11 was affecting the market. We don't -- we don't think we 12 are entitled to relief if it was the weather that was 13 affecting the market. FERC's 2003 staff -14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Are you entitled to relief 15 if there was manipulation, but these people were not 16 engaging in the manipulation? In other words, they are, 17 in effect, innocent of the manipulation; but they, as 18 sellers, are in a chaotic market. Are you entitled to 19 relief against them under those circumstances? 20 MR. WRIGHT: We -- we don't think that a 21 statute that protects consumers and says that consumers 22 get just and reasonable rates was enacted to prevent -23 to overcome contracts only when there is fraud in the 24 contract. 25 JUSTICE SOUTER: The trouble is that
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 justness is a relational category, and you are -- I 2 think you are saying we don't have to consider justness 3 to the parties who were doing -- we will assume for the 4 sake of the question -- the best that they could under 5 bad circumstances. You are saying justness only goes to 6 the ultimate retail ratepayer. 7 MR. WRIGHT: Again, Your Honor, we don't 8 need the statute. The statute is superfluous insofar as 9 it affects contracts, and that is its main effect, if it 10 requires fraud in the negotiation of the contract. 11 And, again, if Morgan Stanley can show that 12 it was a victim of manipulation, too, then it is 13 entitled to relief. There has certainly been some of 14 that with respect to some of these spot market deals 15 where there are occasionally intervening parties. 16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Wright, I really don't 17 understand why you would -- why you say, you know, if -18 if the chaos is due to the weather or maybe, you know, 19 an Arab oil embargo or whatever, that that's perfectly 20 okay. But if it's due to manipulation, it's bad. I can 21 understand if you added manipulation by one of the 22 parties, by the sellers, that I could understand. 23 But so long as it's a factor extrinsic to 24 the parties to the contract, what difference does it 25 make to the buyer whether the flukishness of the market
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 is caused by the weather or by manipulation by somebody 2 other than the seller? 3 In other words, I think it's not enough to 4 show manipulation. That's what's going on in the 5 market. And you're trying to save yourself from it. So 6 long as it's not manipulation by the seller, I don't see 7 how you have a -- I don't know -- an equitable case. 8 MR. WRIGHT: It -- on the equities, if the 9 local utilities end up bearing the brunt of making bad 10 judgments about the weather, that's one thing. It's 11 quite another thing if there is rampant non-compliance, 12 hiding the fact that there's been massive withholding of 13 energy, and driving -- and these spikes were not 14 accidental, by any means. That seems to us to be, you 15 know, a -- a sort of distinction that the -- that the 16 law draws all the time. 17 And let me say the example came -18 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm still puzzled by your 19 answer to Justice Scalia. If, say, it is something like 20 an atom bomb or terrorism or something totally innocent, 21 where the parties are -- but it causes the same economic 22 consequence, namely: That the rates are a lot higher 23 than they otherwise would be, why do you draw the 24 distinction that he says doesn't make sense? 25 MR. WRIGHT: Well, I guess the ultimate
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 distinction is that there isn't somebody making a whole 2 lot of money on account of market manipulation 3 somewhere. 4 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but in each case the 5 rates would be higher than they otherwise would, and 6 you'd have to say they're high enough to be no longer 7 just and reasonable. 8 MR. WRIGHT: Well, "just and reasonable," 9 again, has always -- has traditionally first meant a 10 sort of cost-of-service inquiry and more recently means 11 a market inquiry. But, again, a market inquiry doesn't 12 -- means a competitive market, an effective market, as 13 Professor Kahn said, not a market totally infected by 14 manipulation. And then, in any case -15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if infected by an act 16 of God, it seems to me the same consequence. 17 MR. WRIGHT: I guess consumers bear the 18 brunt of acts of God, but don't -- shouldn't bear the 19 brunt of market manipulation that was unlawful and now 20 is -21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think you could argue 22 that it should be just the obverse. 23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't you really arguing 24 -- no, but aren't you really making the argument that 25 the notion of justness does have an equitable component
43

1 that looks to the source of the trouble; and if the 2 source of the chaos in the market are the very people 3 who are trying to make a profit on your contract, that 4 is a reason to say that that market-based rate is not a 5 just one, because they created the conditions that gave 6 them the leverage to get you to make the deal that you 7 made? 8 But if they are not guilty of improper 9 conduct in making it, then, you know, everybody has to 10 take his lumps. Aren't you saying something like that? 11 MR. WRIGHT: We don't know because FERC 12 hasn't looked at it, what -- who Morgan Stanley paid and 13 what they paid and who made the money here. 14 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but just as a general 15 premise, in your answer to Justice Scalia weren't you 16 assuming something like that? 17 MR. WRIGHT: We certainly think that the 18 best result would be that whoever was manipulating the 19 market ought to be the one who ends up getting their 20 return cut; and that the local utilities and any 21 innocent middlemen should be made whole, too. That's 22 fine. 23 It was brought up earlier in discussing the 24 market-based rate program sort of what sorts of remedies 25 were allowed. And let me say that -- well, I think this
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 came out, but the Enron example shows very well. Enron 2 got market-based rate authority in 1993. Enron was not 3 the only player, but was a leading player in the market 4 manipulation in 2000-2001. FERC didn't get around to 5 lifting their market-based rate authority until 2003, 6 and they did it strictly prospectively. 7 It is a core point of our argument today 8 that that shouldn't be allowed. And I think the answer 9 was: Well, market-based rate authority only results in 10 lifting the market-based rate authority; a 206 action 11 under the Federal Power Act is where consumers get 12 relief. 13 That's right, and we're here to get relief, 14 and we think that ultimately the parties that 15 manipulated the market and made too much money on 16 account of the manipulation ought to -- ought to lose 17 what they paid; and, certainly, the ratepayers shouldn't 18 bear the costs; and if there are innocent middlemen they 19 shouldn't bear the cost, either. 20 JUSTICE SOUTER: And, to the extent that you 21 make that argument, that's an answer, sort of, to the 22 question that I put to you a couple of times: Why, why 23 isn't your argument anything less broad than the fact 24 that you can't make a contract in a chaotic market? 25 And you are, at least as a subset of what
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 you are saying, telling us that if the contract -- if 2 the chaos in the market was caused by the impropriety of 3 one contracting party, that party should not profit from 4 it. And I understand that answer. That if -- to the 5 extent that that is your position, it is an answer to my 6 question. 7 MR. WRIGHT: Thank you, Your Honor. 8 And let me remind the Court that one case 9 that the other side I don't think has acknowledged 10 sufficiently is this Court's 1974 Texaco decision. That 11 was a situation where FERC -- well, the Federal Power 12 Commission attempted -- attempted to do what the other 13 side is asking this Court to rule today, to essentially 14 make contracts sacrosanct and not subject to any 15 challenge. 16 FERC had told small producers that it 17 wouldn't -- that they could enter into contracts and 18 they didn't have to file the contracts, and the 19 Commission wouldn't review the contracts to see if they 20 were just and reasonable. This Court very clearly held, 21 quote, "The Commission lacks authority to place 22 exclusive reliance on market prices," unquote. 23 Under this statute, which requires just and 24 reasonable rates, there must be coexistence between 25 contracts and a regulatory backstop. And, again, in the
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 situation here that you helped me review -- the worst 2 electricity market crisis in history, rampant 3 non-compliance, rates that were multiples of traditional 4 levels, and couldn't be justified under anything FERC 5 has ever called a just and reasonable standard, and FERC 6 had said it was going to examine a benchmark -- this is 7 a case that FERC has to go back and explain why, at 8 least explain why it thinks these rates are just and 9 reasonable. 10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just and reasonable when? 11 MR. WRIGHT: On the day they were made. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: On the day they were 13 agreed to. 14 MR. WRIGHT: And we think they weren't, 15 because they were the product of market manipulation 16 that made all of the rates available -17 JUSTICE SCALIA: They were just and 18 reasonable -19 MR. WRIGHT: -- that made all rates unjust 20 and unreasonable on that date, Your Honor. 21 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I think -- and here I 22 want to be clear on this -- you're saying they were not 23 just and reasonable on the date they were made, number 24 one, if the market manipulation that caused the chaos 25 was manipulation by these Petitioners. That at least is
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 part of your argument. 2 But I think you're also saying that the 3 rates were not just and reasonable if they were the 4 result of market manipulation by others, not these 5 Petitioners. Am I correct that your argument is broad 6 enough to encompass the second alternative? 7 MR. WRIGHT: Absolutely, Your Honor. 8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 9 JUSTICE ALITO: And even that argument is 10 much narrower than what the Ninth Circuit held, isn't 11 it? The Ninth Circuit just referred to "dysfunction in 12 the market." They didn't say: And dysfunction means 13 manipulation by anybody. They seemed to have included 14 all sorts of other things: The California regulatory 15 program, the weather, and a number of other factors. 16 MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, we certainly agree 17 that the test can't be dysfunction; that FERC has to 18 grapple with this issue and give it a concrete meaning. 19 I'm sure there would be disagreement on 20 remand as to exactly what it means, and there are lines 21 to be drawn. But FERC needs to do that. FERC hasn't 22 done that. 23 FERC honestly thought -- again, this is an 24 unusual case. FERC honestly thinks that the public 25 interest standard, or thought that the public interest

1 standard, is a completely different animal than the just 2 and reasonable standard. 3 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you are relying on the 4 narrowest ground that Justice Souter mentioned, namely, 5 manipulation by the seller, wasn't it incumbent on you 6 to demonstrate that there was manipulation by the 7 seller? Has that been -- has that been established? 8 MR. WRIGHT: We are relying on both, Your 9 Honor. We are -- our -- our main argument is that all 10 rates in the West at this period of time -11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because of manipulation by 12 somebody. 13 MR. WRIGHT: -- were the result of 14 manipulation. 15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 16 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, didn't the ALJ find 17 there wasn't manipulation in this market, the forward 18 market? 19 MR. WRIGHT: And the ALJ found that the spot 20 market -- the ALJ found that the spot market 21 manipulation didn't affect the forward markets. No one 22 agrees to that today. FERC has disowned it. Morgan 23 Stanley has disowned it. I'm told that the ALJ has 24 disowned it. 25 JUSTICE ALITO: FERC disowned -- did FERC

1 reject the finding of the ALJ as to manipulation of this 2 -3 MR. WRIGHT: FERC said it was irrelevant. 4 That was the part of FERC's first order, where it said 5 it is irrelevant whether the manipulation of the spot 6 markets affected manipulation in the long-term markets. 7 That would be relevant only if the just and reasonable 8 standard applies. Of course, the just and reasonable 9 standard applies. 10 One final point. One remarkable aspect of 11 this case is after FERC said that in its initial order, 12 Morgan Stanley asked them to reconsider it, and they 13 said we won't do that. Thank you. 14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Kneedler, in your 15 rebuttal, will you address the state of the record with 16 respect to evidence or findings about possible 17 manipulation by these Petitioners? 18 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 19 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FERC, 20 IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS 21 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. On page 1589 of the 22 joint appendix the Commission said we've reviewed the 23 staff reports findings in the 100-day discovery, which 24 were discovery occurring in other proceedings, and found 25 no evidence to support a finding of market manipulation

1 that specifically affected the contracts at issue. 2 It's important to recognize that there were 3 two separate markets here. There was the spot market, 4 which had struck in addition to all the weather and all 5 those things, it had structural problems requiring the 6 California investor-owned utilities to trade on the spot 7 market, which contributed to the opportunities for the 8 manipulation. The dysfunction and manipulation were 9 tied together in that market, but there was -- the ALJ 10 found that the long-term market was not dysfunctional. 11 It was functioning, it operated as it should. Both 12 parties -13 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- know that's a premise 14 in the debate. I find it hard to accept. How could the 15 two be totally separate? It was the crisis that made it 16 necessary to engage in the long-term account. 17 MR. KNEEDLER: FERC has great discretion in 18 deciding how to apply the public interest standard. 19 It's not necessary to find that they were absolutely 20 separate. It's sufficient, though, to say that the 21 problems in the two separate markets -- the situations 22 in the two separate markets were very different. And in 23 the long-term market, FERC concluded it was important to 24 maintain the integrity of the contracts, indeed, under a 25 market-based system, as Justice Alito said, more
51

1 important now even than at the time of Mobile, because 2 you can't have a functioning market based-rate system 3 without confidence that contracts would be upheld. 4 In that situation, as this Court suggested 5 in Verizon, you had sophisticated buyers and 6 sophisticated sellers dealing in a situation in which 7 both knew that there was chaos in the spot market, that 8 there was -- there were structural problems there, and 9 that there were allegations of manipulation. But those 10 allegations did not carry over to the, to the long-term 11 market. 12 JUSTICE SCALIA: May I ask, I am sure you 13 understand that a finding that there was no 14 manipulations that affected these contracts is not the 15 same as a finding that there was no manipulation by 16 these sellers in the market. 17 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. 18 JUSTICE SCALIA: And there is no such 19 finding that there was no manipulation? 20 MR. KNEEDLER: That's correct. But what -21 JUSTICE SCALIA: And there is no finding 22 that there was by these sellers. 23 MR. KNEEDLER: That's correct. And what the 24 Commission was basically saying is we are treating the 25 long-term market situation differently. Some of these
52

1 sellers may have been engaged in manipulation in the 2 short-term market, but FERC was trying to draw a 3 distinction between the spot market and moving forward 4 and maintaining the integrity of markets in the 5 long-term where both the buyers and the sellers were 6 both buyers and sellers typically. 7 JUSTICE SOUTER: But, in fact, it didn't get 8 that articulate. The closest it came to answering my 9 question, I take it, is at the point to which you 10 referred me in the joint appendix, no effect on these 11 contracts? 12 MR. KNEEDLER: That's correct. We don't 13 think FERC should have to engage in a market-based 14 evaluation of possible manipulation in order to hold two 15 parties, two sophisticated parties to their bargain. 16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then what do you say 17 about the standard of justness? In effect, I think 18 you're saying it doesn't matter whether these particular 19 Petitioners manipulated the market creating the 20 conditions under which these contracts were made at a 21 price which turned out to be much higher than the spot 22 price would be later, it's irrelevant. That's your 23 position, isn't it? 24 MR. KNEEDLER: The manipulation in the spot 25 market, we think FERC properly concluded, did not have

1 to be taken into account -2 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not talking about what 3 FERC said. I'm talking about your position. I think 4 your position is that even if these people -- even if 5 these people -- Petitioners manipulated and that created 6 the -- or contributing to creating the market under 7 which these contracts were made, that is irrelevant in 8 looking at the contracts -9 MR. KNEEDLER: I think that's something that 10 FERC would have to decide in this case. But I don't 11 believe a claim of that sort has been made here. I 12 believe the claim has -13 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not asking what claim 14 has been made. I want to know -- I want to know what 15 the government's position is. And as I understand the 16 government's position is that manipulation by these 17 Petitioners would be irrelevant to a review under the 18 public interest standard, is that right? 19 MR. KNEEDLER: I think that's the best way 20 to read FERC's decision in this case. And I think 21 that's -22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that the best way to 23 read the government's position. 24 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. 25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Here and now in this

1 courtroom. 2 MR. KNEEDLER: That FERC -- our position is 3 that FERC was not required in the public interest, which 4 looks at the market as a whole not just the two parties 5 to the contract, it looks to the consequences for the 6 market as a whole in unraveling particular contracts 7 because there might have been manipulation somewhere 8 else. We think FERC, recognizing the importance of 9 integrity of contracts, could decide that it was going 10 to look no further than the particular contracts at 11 issue in deciding whether there was market manipulation. 12 JUSTICE STEVENS: The case is undertaken. 13 (Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the 14 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
