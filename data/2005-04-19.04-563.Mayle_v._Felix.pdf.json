    "speech": "We'll hear argument next in Deneice A. Mayle v. Jacoby Lee Felix. Mr. Chan."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1996, Congress made an important change to the habeas corpus proceedings by enacting a one-year statute-of-limitations period. This Court is now asked to consider, for the first time, how the relation back doctrine under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(2) is to be applied in the habeas context. The Warden advocates a rule for relation back is that the conduct transaction occurrence set forth in the initial petition is the core of operative facts to support the constitutional violations alleged. This rule is far superior to the Ninth Circuit's rule, which a majority of Circuits have determined effectively nullifies AEDPA's one-year statute of limitations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, of course, I take it the issue doesn't even arise unless the amendment is accepted under 15(a)."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "That's correct, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "And if there's been lack of diligence, et cetera, and -- or some prejudice to the accept the amendment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "I should clarify that -- not?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "Well, Your Honor, the rule does not require the State to respond to petitions until ordered by Rule 15(a), even after a responsive pleading has been filed, Rule 15(a) does not serve the same purposes as Rule"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "I do understand, Your Honor. And for pro se petitions, without counsel, the State is not even aware of the existence of the petition until it is served by the Court. And that occurs after the Court has made a determination as to whether or not a responsive pleading is required. It can happen that a Petitioner will be able to amend his petition after the statute of limitations has already expired, and we would not even know of that until after everything had been done."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "But you -- you have --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "No, please, go ahead."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "I was going to say, if -- on the scenario that you have raised, in which you don't even know that the petition has been filed, because the -- you don't -- the Court hasn't called for a response, the whole rationale behind the narrow reading is absent, as I understand it, because you point out that the rationale for the narrow reading is that the first pleadings put you on notice as to the case that you have to meet. And you shouldn't then have to be given an entirely new case to meet after you've been put on notice and taken whatever preliminary steps you've taken. But in the scenario that you're talking about, you have not been put on notice, because you don't even know there is a petition there yet. You have not been led to prepare a case which has now changed. So it seems to me that your rationale does not apply in the case in which you do not yet have notice, and, hence, have not filed a response, for that reason. still prejudiced by the fact that now we have to address additional claims that would otherwise be time-barred. We you're arguing for -- i.e., \"We ought to be able to rely on the notice that we have given\" -- is an argument which hasn't arisen yet, because there's no factual basis to make."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "Well, that situation would occur not as frequently as the situation in which we face an amendment after we have notice, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Mr. Chan, there is really no way for the State entirely to protect itself by -- even by filing an answer immediately. That would protect it against the automatic acceptance of an amendment, but it wouldn't protect it against the District Judge's ability to grant an amendment after the response."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "That's right, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "There's no way to get any protection against that, no matter how promptly you respond."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "That's absolutely correct. And Congress could not have intended its statute-of- limitations rule to be -- to have its effectiveness dependent upon the Court exercise of discretion under Rule 15(a)."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "The discretion --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "Why --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "Which has liberally granted amendments."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "The discretion under 15(a), at least in the general run of civil proceedings, that is to be liberally exercised in favor of the pleaders that are so -- so it's a different -- the 15(c) relation-back test is quite different from the general attitude to pleading amendments, \"Well, we'll let the Plaintiff,\" or, here, the Petitioner, \"make the pleading alteration, and then it will be there, and the Court will make a determination of whether the pleading is good or not.\" But, at the 15(a) threshold, it's not much -- it's not much of a screening device, is it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "No, Your Honor. The better screening device is in Rule 15(c)(2). As mentioned, Rule 15(c)(2) is the provision that determines whether or not a claim is time-barred. And 15(a), then, can determine whether or not the claim can be amended if it is not time-barred."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REHNQUIST",
    "speech": "Mr. Chan, do you think the Rules of Civil Procedure should be applied in habeas cases after AEDPA the same way they are in civil -- other civil litigation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "If the Court is referring to Rule 15(c)(2), our argument is that Rule 15(c)(2) is not a rule of automatic relation back, in civil terms, in civil cases; and, therefore, should not be applied as a rule of automatic relation back in habeas cases."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REHNQUIST",
    "speech": "But what if we were to determine that in regular civil litigation it is relatively automatic? What would your position be with respect to habeas cases after AEDPA?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "Well, my argument would be that the habeas Rule 11 provides that, to the -- to the extent that the civil rules are not inconsistent with the federal habeas provisions and rules, that they may be applied. And I think that Rule 11 compels a reading that if you have one application that is inconsistent with AEDPA's provisions and the framework of habeas corpus, and another interpretation that is not inconsistent, then you must go with the interpretation that is consistent with AEDPA."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "But you have more than Rule 11; you have Section 2244, which says that an application for habeas corpus, quote, \"may be amended as provided in the rules of procedure applicable to civil actions.\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "And that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SCALIA",
    "speech": "So, I don't think it's even a close question whether the rules of procedure for amendment in civil actions apply."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "There's no question that -- we are not questioning that Rule 15(c)(2) applied to habeas corpus, but Section 2242 does not give any guidance as to how 15(c)(2) should be interpreted. And I believe that guidance comes from Rule 11."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "Mr. Chan, can I ask you a question, based on your experience? I'm sure you've had a about six months beyond the statute of limitations when he asked to relate back. It would seem to me that that would wondering about how serious a problem it is."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "It can be a more serious problem in capital litigation, where you're dealing with many more claims, which could be more complex, which could require exhaustion for the -- before the federal review. It just depends on the nature of the claim and the nature of the issues involved. I think that the statistics that were cited in the Justice Department study have different dates for how long cases pend, depending on the nature of the claim, whether it be for prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance, and so forth."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "But in the capital case, you've got a specific provision in there. I mean, for the capital case, which is the one, I agree, you worry about most, because there's reason to delay there, Congress provided specifically for states to opt in; and when they opt in, they get the benefit of pretty rigorous time bars."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "That's true, Your Honor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "And so, why -- I mean, isn't the answer to the capital-case problem exactly the answer that Congress gave, and, if a state does not want to opt in, then the normal amendment rules apply?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "The Chapter 154 provisions do set forth a fast track for capital cases if the State can establish certain appointment procedures for counsel. However, it did not speak to the interpretation of Rule 15(c)(2), and Congress could not have intended that the statute of limitations not apply to Chapter 153 simply"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "What is your definition of the test under 15(c)(2)? I mean, on the one side, the takes an entirely different set of facts to establish that new claim."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "The successive petition rules, or the rules prohibiting successive petition, seem to treat the entire attack as one -- as one legal theory, as one case. And it seems to me to be in -- somewhat intentioned for that, for you to break it down the way you want to under Rule 15(c)."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "I think that the Respondent made a similar argument, based on a res judicata claim, and it was noted in the treatises that were cited that you have different intents behind res judicata and the relation- back doctrine, and they just do not apply that way. I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REHNQUIST",
    "speech": "Very well, Mr. Chan. Ms. Blatt, we'll hear from you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The relevant conduct, transaction or occurrence in the habeas context is the set of facts that are asserted in support of the particular grounds for relief under habeas Rule 2. That reference point best preserves Congress' intent under AEDPA to accelerate the filing and disposition of habeas proceedings."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Are you, Ms. Blatt, taking ordinarily to the mine run of civil cases under 15(c)?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "I think, Justice Ginsburg, our rules require, and that is the prisoner to identify a particular unconstitutional conduct or occurrence that gives rise to a basis for relief. Now, under the Ninth Circuit's view, a prisoner can timely file one claim and then add any number of completely different claims after the one-year period. For instance, a timely Batson challenge could then -- after the one year, the claim could add claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, Brady violations, or coerced confession. And to have to resolve those claims would significantly extend the limitations period beyond the one-year period."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "O'CONNOR",
    "speech": "Well, this case isn't as extreme as that, is it? It has to do with evidence admitted at trial."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "It's -- well, that's true, it takes in trial errors, but that's a lot. Ineffective assistance of counsel is a trial error. Coerced confession, confrontation clause, discriminatory selection in the jury -- I mean, I don't know if that's a trial, or maybe pretrial -- but it does take in a lot, and I don't think there's a close call that they relate to different actors, different time periods --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "O'CONNOR",
    "speech": "Well, certainly in the civil- case context, generally, the interpretation has been pretty broad. And I suspect if we try to narrow it a lot, we're going to have a lot of litigation about this point."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "I'm not sure about that. This has been the rule in the majority of Circuits for five or six years now, since 1999 or 2000, and it hasn't generated a lot of problems. And that's because, Justice O'Connor --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "O'CONNOR",
    "speech": "Can you articulate the rule that you want? Be as precise as you can, if you would."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "It would be the set of facts that are asserted in support of the grounds for relief in the original habeas petition. And the reason why this hasn't generated a problem, Justice O'Connor, is that -- in the way the Courts of Appeals haven't really had to identify a test -- is because they're so disparate in time and type. You have an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim that's timely raised, and then there's discriminatory selection of the jury."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "How about a case --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "If I sue for negligence or, in any civil action we might -- we might imagine, there might be three or four ways in which the Defendant has injured me, and the Tiller case, the railroad case, tells us that it's a single action. And do you concede this, that you're asking us to interpret this differently and more narrowly than in the civil context?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Or do you concede that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "I concede that -- it's hard to is not a train accident. And there is --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, it's hard for me to"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "I would be --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "You want us to interpret it differently."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "That would be totally acceptable, because of the distinct interest in not only the finality in the interest of society, and repose --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "KENNEDY",
    "speech": "Well, I'm sure it would be acceptable, but what's the authority for interpreting the rule two different ways, depending on the case?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "Well, it's not like there's a habeas civil proceeding that we're asking for a habeas -- habeas proceeding to be different. There is no counterpart to a tort action or a contract action where it's liberal pleading requirements under Rule 8, and every single grounds for relief in a habeas proceeding there is a requirement that the prisoner actually identify all the grounds and the particular facts in support of that, and those heightened pleading requirements focus the proceeding on that particular transaction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "Well, let me -- let me ask you how that would work in this case. The original claim is that there was a Fourth Amendment violation in admitting, you know, unlawfully seized evidence. Later, the Petitioner wants to amend to claim ineffective assistance of counsel, because counsel totally overlooked the leading case, directly on point, on this particular evidence. Is that arising out of the same operative set of facts, or is -- or is that something different? Clearly, the facts are not exactly the same. Close enough?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "Well, we'd look to the common core. And I think we would argue that one is focusing on counsel's performance, and the other is on police misconduct. But, Justice Souter --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "Yes, but if that's -- if that's the line you're going to draw, then it seems to me that, in effect, what you are saying is, you can't amend. Because I can't imagine an operative set of facts that are going to be much close than -- in the real world, than the -- than the two sets that I gave you; and if they're not close enough, you're really arguing for a no-amendment rule."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "There's amendment all the time in the majority of Circuits that have applied the Government's test, and it comes up in two scenarios --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "Not if you were the judge."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "No, that's not true, Justice Souter."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "No, but, I mean, why --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "Because --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "-- why --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "Let me just say, on the attorney- ineffectiveness one, it's completely besides the point what the Government's view is, because the claims are completely derivative, and the prisoner gets no benefit whether he gets the amendment or not, because, in order to show procedural default, he's going to have to show attorney effectiveness, and he just doesn't get anything additional, one way or the other, and it really doesn't matter which claim he asserts first. But the reason why amendment occurs all the time is because our rule allows the prisoner to amplify facts such that if he raises a Miranda claim or a Strickland claim, and doesn't allege custody or doesn't allege prejudice under Strickland, he can amend, after the one- year period. And also --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "SOUTER",
    "speech": "So you can amend -- you can amend your factual basis, as it were, but you can't amend your claims."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "No, the way you get claims, which is really the -- the direct text on the rule says you can add a claim if it arises out of the same -- is if the transaction relates to the -- to give you an example, to an involuntary confession, you could have an amendment of a Miranda claim that arises out of that police -- alleged police misconduct that culminated in the admission of the confession. You could also have a Massiah violation that related back to a Fifth Amendment claim. And you could have other types, too."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "It seems to me that the reason for the -- for defining the relation back the way the rule does is interest in fairness to the Defendant you don't want to let him be surprised; whereas, your claim, as I understand, is really based entirely on the interest in finality and repose."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "Well, I think the interest of notice is part of it. I mean, it doesn't always trigger when the State hasn't -- or the Federal Government hasn't answered. But statute of limitations are not only about fairness, in terms of preserving evidence, but the interest in repose --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "No, but the definition --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "-- and closure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "-- in the rule is really to protect the interest in fairness, because interest in repose is always the same."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "Well, that -- it's to preserve the statute of limitations, but if the relevant transaction is something narrower than the conviction, then the interest of repose sets in. And, I mean, the other side has, you know, the same point -- it's if you draw it out broad enough --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "Well, the interest in repose is always there. You'd always like to preserve the defense, whenever you can. That's really what's at stake here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "Well, I think what's at stake is Congress' intent in passing the one year. And it's fundamentally inconsistent with that to have a prisoner timely file one claim and then potentially add an unlimited number of claims, no matter how different and -- in time and type --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "Even if they all come in just two or three months after the statute's run."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "Well --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "STEVENS",
    "speech": "It's really not a big deal."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "-- a six-month difference is a 50- percent extension of the limitations period, which is a big deal. And Congress wanted a --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "And here, it was five months."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "I think it was five months."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "It was five months. And --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "Are you relying, Ms. Blatt, at all on the difference between the pleading rules for civil cases, generally, and habeas, where you do have a whole set of pleading rules, separate the habeas rules?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BLATT",
    "speech": "May I answer? I think we're relying on both habeas Rule 2 and the principles under AEDPA on finality."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REHNQUIST",
    "speech": "Thank you, Ms. Blatt. Mr. Porter, we'll hear from you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PORTER",
    "speech": "Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to respond to the finality concern, because I think that really goes to the heart of this case. Three weeks ago, this Court, in Rhines versus Weber, unanimously approved of the stay-and-abeyance procedure, because the Petitioner's interest in obtaining review of his federal claims outweighed the competing interests of finality and speedy resolution of the federal petition. Now, Mr. Felix's case is even more compelling than Rhines, because, unlike the stay-and-abeyance procedure, which is just the power -- the inherent power of the Court to control its docket, here we're talking about the command of Congress. In Section 2242, of the judicial code, Congress provided, specifically, that the rules governing amendments of habeas petitions be controlled by the rules governing civil procedure. The only rule regarding -- we can accept that, but we still have to interpret what's a transaction or occurrence, I assume. And is it open to require specifying all the grounds for relief available to the Petitioner, state the facts supporting each ground. It seems to me that those different pleading requirements occurrence for the one is not the same as what is the relevant transaction or occurrence for the other."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "REHNQUIST",
    "speech": "Whatever the reason for it is, certainly you can interpret the rules to say that the pleading requirement being different and much"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PORTER",
    "speech": "I think that that's -- Congress reasonably could have said that, and reasonably could have"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "I mean, what's bothering me about this case is, I don't know that the Government needs to argue that there is a different rule. As I read the \"core operative fact.\" Core operative facts in a tort case, where the engine of Train A runs into the caboose of habeas cases are train wrecks, so I hope that's not -- but I think there is a logical difference between them. But I think when you look carefully at the case of Tiller, those really were very different facts about the head car not being lit and the rear of the locomotive not being lit. After all, those were two separate legal claims, as well."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But, Mr. Porter --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PORTER",
    "speech": "The first one --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "-- all that would be required to allege, to take the four-line complaint -- all that the Plaintiff would have to say in that tort case is, \"The train was negligently operated,\" with nothing more specific than that. And then the particulars could come out later. Under habeas, you can't do that. You must set out your grounds, and the -- Rule 2 is very specific about that. So, it's a very different approach to what you have to allege, going in."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PORTER",
    "speech": "I agree, Your Honor, but you -- I think you need to step back and look at the purpose for the difference in the pleading rules. The purpose is, if the -- if the reason was that you have to give specific facts to put the other side on notice, I would say that there is a compelling argument that that should be -- that should inform this Court's decision about how Rule 15(c) should be read. But it's very clear, from 2243 and from habeas Rule 4, that the purpose for requiring the facts underlying the claims is not to give notice to the other side, but to allow the District Court to perform its petition is facially valid or not. If it's not valid, then the Warden is not even served with the petition. It that doesn't seem to comport with the common sense, I'm running around Congress' effort with the one-year statute. So what is your response?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PORTER",
    "speech": "First of all, the response is that the statute -- the rule does not use the term \"core operative facts.\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "No, but every lower court that has -- not every one; you know better than I -- but it seems like a commonly found expression when lower courts have interpreted the Rule 15 and have looked to Tiller. Is that true, or not true?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PORTER",
    "speech": "Not in the habeas context. None of those --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "No, of course not in the habeas context. I'm saying that if we're trying to apply, in the habeas context, the same test that's used elsewhere in the civil law, wouldn't we use the word \"core operative fact\"? Or would we? I'm not as familiar with this as you. What is the answer?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PORTER",
    "speech": "I don't believe so. I think that --"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "No?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PORTER",
    "speech": "-- and Wright and Miller confirmed this, that actually courts have tried to develop different tests: Is it the same evidence that they're going to use? Is it a core of operative facts? And, in the end, they say there's no better test than the one set forth in the rule, and that is conduct, transaction, or occurrence."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "But, of course, we're trying to decide what is the transaction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "PORTER",

    "speaker": "PORTER",
    "speech": "And you should not, because what those courts fail to do is, they fail to appreciate that Congress has already spoken, in two different ways. First, Congress adopted 2242; and when it adopted AEDPA, it did not amend 2242, and it did not amend Rule 15(c). And, second, in death-penalty cases, which, after all, is really the only set of cases where there is an incentive to delay, Congress specifically spoke. And in 2266(b)(3)(B) Congress said, \"Amendments to petitions shall not be permitted after answers are filed unless the Petitioner can make a showing for a second or successive petition.\" Now, this is Lindh versus Murphy all over again. This is a case where Congress has spoken as to Chapter 154. In Lindh versus Murphy, it said, \"That chapter will be -- the amendment will be applied retroactively to cases then pending.\" They did not do anything with Chapter 153 specifically addresses this issue for one limited, narrow set of cases -- and that really make sense in death- issue are the injury. So one -- if a person started out with saying their injury in the civil-rights action was the admission of the evidence --"

    "speaker": "PORTER",
    "speech": "Well, that the that's the problem with the -- with the Warden's proposed test. Are these, quote, \"closely related claims\"? That is not, I suggest, a -- nearly a bright-line rule that would help the District Courts in determining what is, and what is not, part of the same transaction. So, I don't think that that's a real viable alternative. I -- again, I think it's important for the Court to go back -- if it's going to create a different rule in habeas, it has to have some grounding --"

    "speaker": "BREYER",
    "speech": "Well, why doesn't the 1981 -- given -- maybe I don't -- haven't followed it correctly, but why doesn't the 1981 claim, then, relate back? I think the injury that took place from both violations took place at the time of trial."

    "speaker": "PORTER",
    "speech": "Okay. Well, let -- if we can return to the facts of this case, I think these -- we fit comfortably within the definition of \"transaction,\" because both of the rights that Mr. Felix is asserting in this habeas petition are trial rights. Under this Court's decision in Chavez versus Martinez, in this Court's decision in Pennsylvania versus Ritchie, both the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment rights are trial rights. Those statements, independently, when they were taken by the same police officer, did not violate any rights. They only violated Mr. Felix's rights when they were introduced in the -- in the prosecution's case in chief."

  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "-- I right? lawyer, and then he'll come in with a whole lot more.\" And that's quite protective. But suppose you said that to Congress. They here, it doesn't really mean a year. It means a year for this initial filing, and then what's going to happen is, year.\" I don't think Congress is at all surprised by that. And Congress just adopted new rules of habeas proceedings, in 2004; didn't amend Rule 15(c), didn't provide another rule in habeas, didn't amend 2242. And, as far as the potentials for abuse here, the Seventh Circuit's -- Judge Easterbrook's decision for the Seventh Circuit in the Ellzey case has been on the -- on the books for more than two years now. And I would suggest that if the parade of horribles that the Warden has suggested, about year-long delays and all of these potential abuses, in fact, are allowed by the rule that we seek here, that the Warden or the United States would have come to this Court and said, \"Look, here are the abuses. They are happening right now.\" Well, in fact, Ellzey's been cited twice in all -- in these years, by the District Court, to allow relation back. Mr. Felix's case has not been cited at all in a published case. So, I think that the parade of horribles is theoretical and not practical. As Justice Kennedy pointed out, you have Rule 15(a) as a backstop. And once the answer is filed, that really cuts off any right to file an amendment as a matter of right. Then --"

  {
    "speaker": "GINSBURG",
    "speech": "But I think that, first of all, the amendment may be made before there is a defensive plea. As Mr. Chan pointed out, that the Warden doesn't even get the petition until it's been screened by the Court. The other is the understanding, on the civil side, of Rule 15(a). It's a very liberal pleading rule. The threshold very easy to pass."

We ask this Court to affirm the decision of the Circuit Court. If there are no more questions --"

    "speaker": "CHAN",
    "speech": "Mr. Felix assumes that Congress knew about the Tiller case, and assumed that Congress would know that Tiller would be interpreted in a way as to allow relation back in a situation such as this. However, as pointed out, Tiller is not a habeas case. Rule 15(c)(2) did not even have any application to habeas cases at the time, until it was decided. Also, I wanted to respond to Justice Souter's earlier question about examples of relation back in habeas corpus cases. And I've cited two examples on page 27 of the Warden's brief. Unless there's any other questions, I have no more rebuttal."
